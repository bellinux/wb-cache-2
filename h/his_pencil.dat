5|$|At George Washington University, a {{group of}} artists sketch a nude male model. However, one of the artists, John Mostow (Levani Outchaneichvili), draws a demonic {{creature}} in the model's place; while using a utility knife to sharpen <b>his</b> <b>pencil</b> he cuts his hand trying and smears the blood on his drawing. When the model reaches his car after the session, he is attacked and killed by an obscured assailant. The following morning, Mostow is arrested in his apartment by an FBI task force led by Agent Bill Patterson (Kurtwood Smith), who finds the utility knife used in the murder covered in blood.|$|E
5|$|During {{his later}} {{creative}} years, Rodin's work turned increasingly toward the female form, and themes of more overt masculinity and femininity. He concentrated on small dance studies, and produced numerous erotic drawings, sketched {{in a loose}} way, without taking <b>his</b> <b>pencil</b> from the paper or {{his eyes from the}} model. Rodin met American dancer Isadora Duncan in 1900, attempted to seduce her, and the next year sketched studies of her and her students. In July 1906, Rodin was also enchanted by dancers from the Royal Ballet of Cambodia, and produced some of his most famous drawings from the experience.|$|E
5|$|For the Antwerp {{publisher}} Ons Volk, {{he created}} three comics, published as books without a prepublication {{in a newspaper}} or magazine. Piwo, about the adventures of a wooden horse, became his first comic album in 1943, and was followed by two sequels in 1944 and 1946. Those comics were also published in French. For the same editor, he illustrated 11 children books. In the same years, he also created the cover illustration {{for a number of}} novels from other publishers. In 1944, he also started working for two more magazines, De Rakker and De Illustratie, where he created some comics and made numerous illustrations. To help him with all this work, his wife Paula inked many of <b>his</b> <b>pencil</b> drawings in these years.|$|E

25|$|In 1915, Leo Frank, an American Jew, was lynched near Atlanta, Georgia. Frank {{had been}} convicted in 1913 {{for the murder of}} Mary Phagan, a thirteen-year-old girl {{employed}} by <b>his</b> <b>pencil</b> factory. There were a series of appeals, but all failed. The final appeal, was a 7-2 decision by the US Supreme Court. After Governor John Slaton commuted Frank's sentence to life imprisonment, a group of men, calling themselves the Knights of Mary Phagan, kidnapped Frank from a prison farm in Milledgeville in a planned event that included cutting the prison's telephone wires. They transported him 175 miles back to Marietta, near Atlanta, where they lynched him in front of a mob.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{childhood}} memories made lifelong impressions on him. As a boy, he carved a tiny mannequin {{into the end}} of the wooden ruler from <b>his</b> <b>pencil</b> case and placed it inside the case. He added a stone, which he had painted into upper and lower halves, and hid the case in the attic. Periodically, he would return to the mannequin, often bringing tiny sheets of paper with messages inscribed on them in his own secret language. He later reflected that this ceremonial act brought him a feeling of inner peace and security. Years later, he discovered similarities between his personal experience and the practices associated with totems in indigenous cultures, such as the collection of soul-stones near Arlesheim or the tjurungas of Australia. He concluded that his intuitive ceremonial act was an unconscious ritual, which he had practiced {{in a way that was}} strikingly similar to those in distant locations which he, as a young boy, knew nothing about. His observations about symbols, archetypes, and the collective unconscious were inspired, in part, by these early experiences combined with his later research.|$|E
25|$|For 18 years Hersey {{also taught}} two writing courses, in fiction and non-fiction, to undergraduates. Hersey taught his last class in fiction writing at Yale during 1984. In his {{individual}} sessions with undergraduates {{to discuss their}} work, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author was sometimes known to write his comments in the margin, and having discussed his suggestion with the student, to then take out <b>his</b> <b>pencil</b> and erase his comment. As Master of Pierson College, he subsequently hosted his old boss Henry Luce– with whom Hersey had become reconciled after their dispute years prior– when Luce spoke to the college's undergraduates. Time founder Luce was a notoriously dull public speaker, and his address to the Pierson undergraduates was no exception. After Luce's somnolent speech, the former publisher privately revealed to Hersey {{for the first time}} that he and his wife Clare Boothe Luce had taken LSD while supervised by a physician. Hersey later confessed he was relieved that Luce had saved that particular revelation for a more private audience.|$|E

500|$|After his 1936 {{journey to}} the Alhambra and to La Mezquita, Cordoba, where he sketched the [...] Moorish {{architecture}} and the tessellated mosaic decorations, Escher began to explore the properties and possibilities of tessellation using geometric grids {{as the basis for}} his sketches. He then extended these to form complex interlocking designs, for example with animals such as birds, fish, and reptiles. One of his first attempts at a tessellation was <b>his</b> <b>pencil,</b> India ink and watercolour Study of Regular Division of the Plane with Reptiles (1939), constructed on a hexagonal grid. The heads of the red, green and white reptiles meet at a vertex; the tails, legs and sides of the animals exactly interlock. It was used as the basis for his 1943 lithograph Reptiles.|$|E

500|$|Nixon {{then called}} for Stevenson {{to give a}} full {{accounting}} of his own fund, and a full list of the donors. He also called for Senator Sparkman, who, as Nixon repeated, had put his wife on the payroll, to state fully any outside income he might have had. [...] "Because, folks, remember, a man that's to be President of the United States, a man that's to be Vice President of the United States must have the confidence of all the people. And that's why I'm doing what I'm doing, and that's why I suggest that Mr. Stevenson and Mr. Sparkman since they are under attack should do what I am doing." [...] As the senator made this point, Eisenhower, sitting in the Cleveland office, slammed <b>his</b> <b>pencil</b> down, realizing {{that he would not}} be allowed to be the only major party candidate whose finances would evade scrutiny.

500|$|Spiegelman {{rendered}} the original three-page [...] "Maus" [...] and [...] "Prisoner on the Hell Planet" [...] in highly detailed, expressive styles. [...] Spiegelman planned to draw Maus {{in such a}} manner, but after initial sketches he decided to use a pared-down style, one little removed from <b>his</b> <b>pencil</b> sketches, which he found more direct and immediate. [...] Characters are rendered in a minimalist way: animal heads with dots for eyes and slashes for eyebrows and mouths, sitting on humanoid bodies. [...] Spiegelman {{wanted to get away}} from the rendering of the characters in the original [...] "Maus", in which oversized cats towered over the Jewish mice, an approach which Spiegelman says, [...] "tells you how to feel, tells you how to think". [...] He preferred to let the reader make independent moral judgments. [...] He drew the cat-Nazis the same size as the mouse-Jews, and dropped the stereotypical villainous expressions. [...] The contrast between the artwork in [...] "Prisoner on the Hell Planet" [...] and Maus drives home the effectiveness of the simpler artwork—"Prisoner" [...] is alienating, while Maus is more inviting, encouraging deeper contemplation and understanding.|$|E
500|$|While Morris (who by now had {{resigned}} from St James) edited the magazine from Hulton's premises at Shoe Lane in London, the comic {{was created in}} a converted bakery in the Churchtown district of Southport. [...] The building was described by Eagle artist Greta Tomlinson as [...] "very basic, a flagstone floor and a tin roof; there was cold running water in the corner. [...] It was freezing cold {{in the winter and}} boiling hot in the summer". [...] Working to a tight schedule, Hampson created each Dan Dare episode first in pencil, and then in ink and colour. [...] He and his team of artists posed for photographs, in the positions drawn in <b>his</b> <b>pencil</b> sketches (Hampson usually posed for Dan Dare). [...] These photographs were combined with the rough sketches, and his colleagues then worked on the strip while he tackled the opening frame of each week's story. [...] His drawings of the technology Dan Dare employed were meticulous, and were based on a large body of research and reference material, as well as space ship models, plaster heads, mocked-up space suits, and a complete model of a space station. [...] He also wrote the dialogue for several of the comic's pages. [...] Hampson was assisted in his work by expert consultants, among them Arthur C. Clarke (then an aspiring young science fiction writer). [...] Scriptwriters included Anglican priest Chad Varah (founder of Samaritans). [...] Varah also accompanied Morris on tours of Cathedrals often filled with Eagle readers keen to meet the comic's creators. [...] Peter Ling and Macdonald Hastings were contributors, as was Harris Tweed's creator John Ryan, who was also responsible for Captain Pugwash, printed in the first 19issues.|$|E

2500|$|The Silver Surfer debuted as an {{unplanned}} {{addition to}} the superhero-team comic Fantastic Four #48 (March 1966). The comic's writer-editor, Stan Lee, and its penciller and co-plotter, Jack Kirby, had, by the mid-1960s, developed a collaborative technique known as the [...] "Marvel Method": the two would discuss story ideas, Kirby working from a brief synopsis to draw the individual scenes and plot details, with Lee finally adding the dialogue and captions. When Kirby turned in <b>his</b> <b>pencil</b> art for the story, he included a new character he and Lee had not discussed. [...] As Lee recalled in 1995, [...] "There, {{in the middle of}} the story we had so carefully worked out, was a nut on some sort of flying surfboard". He later expanded on this, recalling, [...] "I thought, 'Jack, this time you've gone too far'". Kirby explained that the story's agreed-upon antagonist, a god-like cosmic predator of planets named Galactus, should have some sort of herald, and that he created the surfboard [...] "because I'm tired of drawing spaceships!" [...] Taken by the noble features of the new character, who turned on his master to help defend Earth, Lee overcame his initial skepticism and began adding characterization. The Silver Surfer soon became a key part of the unfolding story.|$|E

Béke és Szabadság, than Szabadság featured his first pictorial stories, than from the first issue of Füles in 1957 he drew comics. His graphic style combines naturalist and cartoon characteristics brought to its highest level in his Jenő Rejtő adaptations, popular to this day. Comics artist, graphic designer, Dávid Cserkuti wrote the following about Korcsmáros's art: [...] "His characters are unmistakable for each other, they are so substantive. The reader has the feeling that the artist knows all of them personally – not superficially, but even their slightest weaknesses. [...] His order of lines are unique, completely set to the drawings, severe. Not the instrument dominates the style of inking, but he is capable of adjusting it to the world of <b>his</b> <b>pencil</b> drawings. I hardly know any other artist, who could keep the original pencil drawings' liveliness, eventuality on the final ink art." ...|$|E
