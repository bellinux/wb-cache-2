Development of precipitation measuring and memory devices was continued with the aim of obtaining a network of <b>gages</b> <b>well</b> suited for measurement of winter snowfall in mountainous regions. Results of the research are highlighted by the development of criteria for seeding winter orographic storms. It was found that the cloud top temperature and vertical motion apparently are the primary factors governing seedability. Indices of vertical motion are also described, so the seedability criteria can be measured readily in operational type projects. It was found that silver iodide released from aircraft upwind of the target area did not diffuse very well by the time the plumes arrived over the target area about an hour later, so that overseeding occurred inside the plumes, and outside the plumes the clouds were underseeded. Precipitation measurements in a target area and other locations as possible controls indicate that correlations of around 0. 8 or 0. 85 probably could be obtained with suitably placed gages, with the consequence that the duration of an experiment to verify a set of seeding criteria would be reduced by a factor of 3 or 4 compared to what would be required in the absence of controls...|$|R

The CX- 100 blade was designed to investigate {{the use of a}} carbon spar cap to reduce weight and increase stiffness while being incorporated using conventional manufacturing techniques. The TX- 100 blade used carbon in the outboard portion of the skin to produce twist-bend coupling to passively alleviate aerodynamic loads. In the fatigue tests, the CX- 100 blade was loaded by a single hydraulic cylinder while the TX- 100 blade was loaded via a hydraulically-actuated resonant loading system called the Universal Resonant Exciter. The blades were outfitted with approximately 30 strain <b>gages</b> as <b>well</b> as displacement and load sensors. Both blades survived to cycle counts sufficient to demonstrate a 20 -year operational life. The CX- 100 blade failed at approximately 1. 6 million cycles because of a buckle and crack that formed and grew just outboard of max-chord.

40|$|In {{order to}} monitor crack {{initiation}} and propagation under static and fatigue loading in adhesively bonded joints, strain profile measurement such as backface strain (BFS) {{is a very}} efficient technique. In single lap (SL) joints, crack initiation and propagation in the glue line can be monitored by detecting the negative peak of the strain profile.

Previously, an array of electrical strain <b>gages</b> as <b>well</b> as fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors had been used successfully to capture the profile of BFS of a SL joint by applying sensors on the backface of an adherend, near the overlap zone. In this work, the backface technique is improved by replacing an array of strain sensors by an ordinary optical fiber (without FBG sensors) connected to an optical backscatter reflectometer. The great advantage of this system over the more conventional arrays of FBG is that {{the entire length of the}} fiber can be used for sensing strains, and hence it provides a better spatial resolution.

Using techniques and equipment developed over several decades for measuring ocean surface currents at much lower frequencies, this radar system continuously measures the river streamflow from a location on one {{bank of the river}} by utilizing Bragg scattering from naturally-occurring water waves of 0. 5 -m wavelength. Data are processed in real time on a portable laptop computer and are available through a dial-up modem. The radar data provide hourly estimates of mean flow and cross-channel variations in the flow. Mean values of the radar flow profile track very closely continuous in-situ stage height measurements. River flow velocities of 0. 8 m·s- 1 - 3. 5 m·s- 1 were observed in the first five months of the experiment, with a nearly linear relationship between radar-inferred flow velocity and stage height of 9 m– 14 m. The radar velocity also appears to have a weak correlation with the local wind and several tidal frequencies. The strong correlation between surface velocity and stage height suggests that – with refinement – surface velocity could replace stage height in river <b>gaging,</b> as <b>well</b> as offering additional flow information...|$|R

The resistance drift of the gage at various temperatures in the phase transition temperature range (PTTR) was measured. The effects of the heating and cooling rates with which the gage passed through the PTTR on the apparent strain characteristics of the gage were also studied. BCL 3 gage, like other Fe-Cr-Al based gages, exhibited apparent strain instability in the temperature range of 700 to 1100 F due to the reversible microstructural transition the gage materials experienced in this temperature range.

Located within the town limits of Farmington, Connecticut, the existing dilapidated rock fill/timber crib Winchell-Smith Dam is approximately four (4) feet high, and spans the entire 200 ’+ widechannel at this location, withthe adjacent historic mill building, currently serving as a restaurant. To balance the desire for the falling water aesthetic over the dam (request of the adjacent mill restaurant owner) with the goal of providing efficient fish passage, an inverted rock ramp fish way was selected for design. This less common rock ramp configuration required detailed hydrologic and hydraulic (H 2 ̆ 6 H) modeling to ensure sufficient flow over the dam while maintaining optimal passing requirements (depths and velocities) through the rock ramp for the target fish species. To account for the range of fish passage flow conditions experienced at the Winchell-Smith dam, the proposed fishway also required the design of a staged weir configuration to allow modification of flows directed to the fishway through the use of weir boards. Design of the proposed weir inlet to the fishway ramp utilized various data sets gathered during field investigation and data collection, including nearby USGS stream <b>gages,</b> as <b>well</b> as pressure transducer (stage only) gages installed both upstream and downstream of the dam.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of jointed plain concrete pavements {{during the initial}} time period following paving provides vital information concerning how the pavement structure will perform throughout its intended life. A primary contributor {{to the development of}} stresses in pavements following paving comes from environmental conditions, particularly from differential thermal and moisture gradients throughout the pavement depth. The following study analyzes the response of a jointed plain concrete pavement structure during the period of initial concrete strength gain (first 72 hours after paving) and throughout a full cycle of seasonal conditions (first ten months after paving). The response of the pavement structure is characterized through the analysis of on-site climatic conditions, analysis of embedded strain, temperature, and moisture <b>gages,</b> as <b>well</b> as through manual field data collection. The field data collection effort conducted for this study is described in terms of an overview of the site conditions, construction parameters, instrumentation utilized and data acquisition employed. The climatic response of the pavement structure was analyzed, with particular emphasis on curling and warping. This study investigated the strain response of the pavement structure with respect to the parameters influencing strain location and magnitude. Both the early-age (the first 72 -hours after paving) and the seasonal strain response with respect to spatial characteristics and level of restraint were analyzed. Based on the results from this study, the built-in construction gradient was found to be 0. 7 °F/in. {{at the edge of the}} slab and negligible at midpanel. In general, the measured curvature tended to be 7 percent larger for unrestrained slabs when compared to restrained slabs. The tie and dowel bars produced a reduction in strain with changes in temperature of approximately 0. 34 to 0. 41 microstrain/°F at locations near the joints. The strains measured in the restrained slabs also tended to be more uniform than for the unrestrained slabs. A couple of seasonal observations were also made. The average strain at midslab was - 450 microstrain in the fall and - 600 microstrain in the winter with diurnal strain fluctuations being the lowest in the winter. This study also evaluated the drying shrinkage that occurred in the slab.

40|$|Composite {{materials}} are being more widely used today by aerospace, automotive, sports equipment, {{and a number}} of other commercial industries because of their advantages over conventional metals. Composites have a high strength-to-weight ratio and can be constructed to meet specific design needs. Composite structures are already in use in secondary parts of the Douglas MD- 11 and are planned to be used in the new MD- 12 X. Plans also exist for their use in primary and secondary structures on the Boeing 777. Douglas proposed MD-XX may also incorporate composite materials into primary structures such as the wings and tail. Use of composites in these structures offers weight savings, corrosion resistance, and improved aerodynamics. Additionally, composites have been used to repair cracks in many B- 1 Bs where traditional repair techniques were not very effective. Plans have also been made to reinforce all of the remaining B- 1 s with composite materials. Verification of the structural integrity of composite components is needed to insure safe operation of these aerospace vehicles. One aspect of the use of these composites is their response to fatigue. To track this progression of fatigue in aerospace structures, a convenient method to nondestructively monitor this damage needs to be developed. Traditional NDE techniques used on metals are not easily adaptable to composites due to the inhomogeneous and anisotropic nature of these materials. Finding an effective means of nondestructively monitoring fatigue damage is extremely important to the safety and reliability of such structures. Lamb waves offer one method of evaluating these composite materials. As a material is fatigued, the modulus degrades. Since the Lamb wave velocity can be related to the modulus of the material, an effective tool can be developed to monitor fatigue damage in composites by measuring the velocity of these waves. In this work, preliminary studies have been conducted which monitor fatigue damage in composite samples using strain <b>gage</b> measurements as <b>well</b> as Lamb wave velocity measurements. A description of the test samples is followed by the results of two different measurements of Lamb wave velocity. The first technique is a contact measurement done at a single frequency, while the second involves an immersion study of Lamb waves in which dispersion curves are obtained. The results of the Lamb wave monitoring of fatigue damage is compared to the damage progression measured by strain gages. The final section discusses the results and conclusions...|$|R
40|$|This study {{considers}} the run-up of non-breaking and breaking solitary waves on a smooth sloping beach. A non-linear theory and a numerical model solving the non-linear shallow water equations (NLSW) {{were developed to}} model this physical process. Various experiments to obtain wave amplitude time-histories, water particle velocities, wave free surface profiles, and maximum run-up were conducted {{and the results were}} compared with the analytical and numerical models. A higher order theoretical solution to the non-linear shallow water equations, which describes the non-breaking wave characteristics on the beach, was sought and is presented in this study. The solution was obtained analytically by using the Carrier and Greenspan (1958) hodograph transformation. It was found that the non-linear theory agreed well with experimental results. The maximum run-up predicted by the non-linear theory is larger than that predicted by Synolakis (1986) at the order of the offshore relative wave height for a given slope. This correction for non-breaking waves on beach decreases as the beach slope steepens, and increases as the relative incident solitary wave height increases. A unique run-up gage that consists of a laser and a photodiode camera was developed in connection with this study to measure the time-history of the tip of the run-up tongue of a non-breaking solitary wave as it progresses up the slope. The results obtained with this run-up <b>gage</b> agree <b>well</b> with other measurements, and this technique provides a simple and reliable way of measuring run-up time-histories. The run-up of breaking solitary waves was studied experimentally and numerically since no fully theoretical approach is possible. The wave characteristics such as wave shape and shoaling characteristics, and, for plunging breakers, the shape of the jet produced are presented. The experimental results show that wave breaking is such a complicated process that even sophisticated numerical models cannot adequately model its details. Two different plunging wave breaking and resultant run-up were found from the experiments. The point where the tip of the incident jet produced by the plunging breaking wave impinges determines the characteristics of the resulting splash-up. If the jet impinges on a dry slope, no splash-up occurs and the plunging breaker simply collapses. If the impingement point is located on the free surface, splash-up including a reflected jet is formed, which further increases the turbulence and energy dissipation associated with wave breaking. It is hypothesized that both clockwise and counterclockwise vortices may be generated by the impinging plunging jet and the reflected jet associated with the splash-up when the jet impinges on the front face of a breaking wave or on the still water surface in front of the wave. If only the run-up process and maximum run-up are of interest, the wave and the water flow produced after breaking can be simplified as a propagating bore, which is analogous to a shock wave in gas dynamics. A numerical model using this bore structure to treat the process of wave breaking and propagation was developed. The non-linear shallow water equations were solved using the weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO) shock capturing scheme employed in gas dynamics. Wave breaking and propagation is handled automatically by this scheme and no ad-hoc term is required. A computational domain mapping technique proposed by Zhang (1996) is used in the numerical scheme to model the shoreline movement. This numerical scheme is found to provide a somewhat simple and reasonably good prediction of various aspects of the run-up process. The numerical results agree well with the experiments corresponding to the run-up on a relatively steep slope (1 : 2. 08) as well as on a more gentle slope (1 : 19. 85). A simple empirical estimate of maximum run-up based on energy conservation considerations is also presented where the energy dissipation associated with wave breaking was estimated using the results from the numerical model. This approach appears to be useful and the maximum run-up predicted agrees reasonably well with the experimental results. The splash-up of a solitary wave on a vertical wall positioned at different locations on a gentle slope was also investigated in this study to understand the degree of protection from tsunamis afforded by seawalls. It was found that the effect of breaking wave kinematics offshore of the vertical wall on the splash-up is of critical importance to the maximum splash-up. The maximum slope of the front face of the wave upon impingement of the wave on the wall, which represents the maximum water particle acceleration, was important in defining the maximum sheet splash-up as well as the trend for splash-up composed of drops and spray...|$|R
40|$|Cayuga Lake {{serves as}} a {{drinking}} water source {{as well as a}} popular recreational lake. It is the second largest of the Finger Lakes (New York, USA), with a long narrow shape. Concerns exist regarding the lake’s phosphorus and turbidity loadings, specifically on the southern shelf (also where three point sources discharge: two waste water treatment plants and Cornell’s Lake Source Cooling Facility). Cayuga Inlet, along with Fall Creek, flow into the southern end and account for 40 % of the total inflow to the entire lake. Studies indicate Cayuga Inlet and Fall Creek account for 87 % of the bioavailable phosphorus load specifically entering in the southern shelf. A number of complex physical processes establish exchange and transport between the lake and the inlet. Understanding which mechanisms control transport of loadings is essential to evaluating the processes that govern water quality. Using data collected over the summer and fall months in 2015 and 2016 along Cayuga Inlet, from the inflowing tributaries, through the inlet, and out to the southern lake, we examine various physical mechanisms and their influence on turbidity loads. Velocity profiles in Cayuga Inlet are captured with an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) and High Resolution (HR) acoustic Doppler Profiler (ADP), and turbulence measures with an acoustic Dopper velocimeter (ADV). Water quality sondes are used to monitor turbidity and temperature along with a widely-distributed set of thermistors to obtain a detailed description of temperature structures throughout the area of interest. Data from United States Geographical Survey (USGS) <b>gage</b> stations as <b>well</b> as local meteorological stations are utilized to more fully understand forcing mechanisms important to flow behavior in Cayuga Inlet. Our results suggest flow through Cayuga Inlet is continuously influenced by barotropic seiches in Cayuga Lake while occasional large baroclinic events occur, the largest of which transport lake water into Cayuga Inlet. Over the stratified season exchange flows are typical and largely forced by temperature differences between the tributaries and southern lake bounding the inlet. The predominant wind stress is along the axis of the lake and the inlet and sets up seiching behavior in the lake which influences flow behavior in the inlet. A strong wind stress also increases vertical mixing in the inlet. Minimal sediment resuspension occurs in the inlet and generally, the inlet is a conduit through which suspended sediment is advected. The tributaries carry significant turbidity loads into the inlet during runoff events, which in two layer flows under conditions of cooler tributary temperatures relative to the inlet and southern lake, typically appear in the lower layer. In the spring, when the southern lake is expected to be cooler than that observed over the summer and fall deployment periods analyzed here and tributary flows are expected to warm faster, significant turbidity loads may pass through the top layer of the inlet with more frequency. At times turbidity loads in the southern lake are transported by seiching back into the inlet and again in two layer flows typically appear in the appropriate stratified layer based on the southern lake temperature relative to the inlet and tributaries...|$|R
