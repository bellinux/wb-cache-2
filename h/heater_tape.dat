40|$|The thermal {{efficiency}} of evaporative heat exchangers is diminishing due to mineral scale buildup on heat exchanger surfaces. A simulated evaporative heat exchanger {{was designed and}} constructed for testing the mitigation effects of polymer coatings on mineral scale deposition rates. The heat exchanger was designed to cool hot mud at 200 °F using a cooling water supply with a calcium concentration of 1000 ppm. The system was constructed using 1. 5 -inch diameter polypropylene piping, a DIG Corporation drip irrigation system, a TotalPond 530 GPH pond pump, an Omega CSI 32 K miniature benchtop controller, Omega FWH 321 - 020 high temperature <b>heater</b> <b>tape,</b> and fifteen copper pipe samples. DuPont™ lab technicians coated ten copper pipe samples with two different fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) polymer coatings: 954 G- 300 Teflon® FEP and 532 - 1003 Teflon® FEP. Both coatings were applied to the exterior of five copper pipe samples each (standard 1. 25 -inch diameter by 1 -foot-long). Additionally, five separate foot-long lengths of 1. 25 -inch diameter copper pipe were used as is. A water solution containing 1 gram of calcium chloride (CaCl 2) per 1 liter of water was prepared to achieve a cooling water supply containing 1000 ppm calcium. This water solution was {{used in conjunction with}} the drip irrigation system and the pond pump to spray the exteriors of the coated and uncoated copper pipes. The <b>heater</b> <b>tape</b> was used in conjunction with the miniature benchtop controller in an attempt to maintain a pipe temperature of 200 °F to replicate hot mud. The simulated evaporative heat exchanger was successful in uniformly delivering highly mineralized water onto heat exchanger pipes; however, the <b>heater</b> <b>tape</b> was unable to provide enough heat energy to maintain the desired temperature of 200 °F...|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAn {{experimental study of}} laminar flow heat transfer of an ethylene glycol/water mixture in an electrically heated horizontal tube using wire mesh (HEATEX) and twisted tape inserts was investigated. Twelve thermocouples, inserted in the tube wall at four longitudinal locations, enabled a mean inside experimental heat-transfer coefficient to be accurately measured. A constant wall heat flux boundary condition {{was placed on the}} wall by wrapping six 200 W flexible <b>heater</b> <b>tapes</b> tightly around the tube. The ethylene glycol/water mixture provided a coolant Reynolds number between 200 - 5000 and a Prandtl number between 30 - 140. Two smooth inside diameters and a roped tube profile were tested with and without the inserts. Heattransfer correlations for tubes without inserts were developed and compared with theory for both thermally and hydrodynamically developing flow. Correlations were also developed for the two types of inserts. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|Major {{components}} of the extraction system of SIS 100 [1] are in the final design phase. Especially the magnetic septa which guide the beam into the high energy beam transport system have been studied in detail. The radiation hardness of the proposed wires for the electrostatic septa for high intensity operation has been verified with beam at the HHT cave at GSI. Design and integration of the extraction septa Due to the large magnetic rigidity of the SIS 100 beam, the maximum achievable septum angle and {{the distance of the}} deflected beam {{to the edge of the}} circulating beam is rather small (3 mrad and 11 mm). On the other hand, the extracted beam has to bypass the next quadrupole magnet with an angle of 3 1 / 3 deg. In fact, this large total deflection angle can be realized with three magnetic septa. Since the gap between two neighbouring s. c. quadrupole units is quite short, the integration of the resonance sextupole magnet, three magnetic septa and the internal beam dump in such a cell is challenging. Figure 1 : Cell number four of the extraction straight (top view). From left to right: resonance sextupole magnet, three magnetic septa, internal beam dump omitted (gap position), s. c. quadrupole cryostat. The XHV conditions needed in SIS 100 require bakeable vacuum chambers of the magnetic septa. Therefore, the septum has been designed with the option to remove the coil and the yoke for the installation of <b>heater</b> <b>tapes,</b> see figure 2. The insulation of the coil has to be kept below 80 °C during baking-out at 300 °C. For technical details of the septa see [2]...|$|R
30|$|QMS (M-QA 100 TS, ANELVA Corp.) {{was used}} for {{real-time}} monitoring. The volatile products were introduced into the QMS through a capillary, which was convolved by <b>tape</b> <b>heater</b> of 200  °C to avoid condensation of coal tar therein. A diaphragm pump was used to help transporting the gas into the QMS by reducing the tube pressure to 25  mbar. The delay time of QMS detection was thus decreased within 5  s. The vacuum degree of QMS was kept at 1  ×  10 − 5 Pa before measurement, and at 1  ×  10 − 3 Pa during measurement. Other details of QMS operation were set as follows: ionizing voltage, 24  V; emission current, 1.0  mA; mass number range, 1 – 80  m/z; scan speed, 100  ms/amu. Mass numbers of 2, 15, 18, 28, and 44 were selected to characterize the presences of H 2, CH 4, H 2 O, CO, and CO 2, respectively. Real-time evolution curves of these five gases during coal pyrolysis were thus obtained.|$|R
40|$|Three {{methods are}} being {{developed}} for keeping water from freezing during high-altitude climbs so that mountaineers can remain hydrated. Three strategies have been developed. At {{the time of this}} reporting two needed to be tested in the field and one was conceptual. The first method is Passive Thermal Control Using Aerogels. This involves mounting the fluid reservoir of the climber s canteen to an inner layer of clothing for better heat retention. For the field test, bottles were mounted to the inner fleece layer of clothing, and then aerogel insulation was placed {{on the outside of the}} bottle, and circumferentially around the drink straw. When climbers need to drink, they can pull up the insulated straw from underneath the down suit, take a sip, and then put it back into the relative warmth of the suit. For the field test, a data logger assessed the temperatures of the water reservoir, as well as near the tip of the drink straw. The second method is Passive Thermal Control with Copper-Shielded Drink Straw and Aerogels, also mounted to inner layers of clothing for better heat retention. Braided wire emanates from the inside of the fleece jacket layer, and continues up and around the drink straw in order to use body heat to keep the system-critical drink straw warm enough to keep water in the liquid state. For the field test, a data logger will be used to compare this with the above concept. The third, and still conceptual, method is Active Thermal Control with Microcontroller. If the above methods do not work, microcontrollers and <b>tape</b> <b>heaters</b> have been identified that could keep the drink straw warm even under extremely cold conditions. Power requirements are not yet determined because the thermal environment inside the down suit relative to the external environment has not been established. A data logger will be used to track both the external and internal temperatures of the suit on a summit day...|$|R
