5|$|Because of the {{initially}} {{broad definition}} of 12-6 <b>elbows</b> in the Unified Rules, referees often had differences in {{interpretation of what}} was classed as one. Referee Herb Dean differed from McCarthy's definition and argued that elbow strikes parallel with the floor in side control (sometimes called 9-3 <b>elbows)</b> were classed as 12-6 <b>elbows,</b> as he considered 12-6 <b>elbows</b> as being based on where the fighter throwing them was positioned.|$|E
5|$|Generally for {{usage of}} 12-6 <b>elbows,</b> {{the fight is}} stopped and fighters are given a warning. However, there have been {{occasions}} where points have been deducted or the fighter using that strike in competition has been disqualified due to the move incapacitating fighters. In 2009, Matt Hamill defeated Jon Jones by disqualification due to Jones using 12-6 <b>elbows.</b> Hamill {{said that he was}} unable to defend against the <b>elbows.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before 2000, MMA had {{a number}} of {{different}} rule sets, with each one differing in ruling on downward elbow strikes (12-6 <b>elbows).</b> In UFC 1, the first UFC event where there were very few rules, Kevin Rosier used 12-6 <b>elbows</b> on Zane Frazier. In 2000, the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts were drawn up {{to try to make the}} sport more mainstream. The meeting consisted of representatives of a number of major MMA organisations including Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), Pride Fighting Championships and International Fighting Championships (IFC) as well as doctors and referees in New Jersey, United States. In the meeting, doctors raised concerns about 12-6 <b>elbows</b> after seeing an IFC match where 12-6 <b>elbows</b> were used to the back of a fighter's head. One doctor argued that they could be life-threatening, and refused to sanction any set of rules that didn't prohibit them.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, the Association of Boxing Commissions (ABC) held a {{committee}} meeting {{to revise the}} Unified Rules. During it, Kizer and Lembo proposed altering the rule on downward elbow strikes to permit 12-6 <b>elbows</b> to anywhere except {{the head of a}} downed opponent. However, the proposal was strongly rejected by doctors on the committee on the grounds that 12-6 <b>elbows</b> could still cause serious injury, even when not done on the head. The ABC, despite endorsing the Unified Rules, does not have statutory authority over the individual state athletic commissions in the United States though governs through influence. As a result, in some states such as Mississippi, 12-6 <b>elbows</b> are permitted in MMA fights. As a result, a commission was set up by ABC to look at the regional MMA rule variations, including 12-6 <b>elbows,</b> to standardise MMA in the United States.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{dislocation}} {{with only}} ligament damage {{is called a}} simple <b>elbow</b> dislocation. A complex <b>elbow</b> dislocation is associated with fractures. Early mobilization exercises may prevent <b>elbow</b> stiffness. Case one is 27 -year old woman with a simple <b>elbow</b> dislocation. Patient was started early mobilization exercises immediately. Case two is a 58 -year {{old man with a}} complex <b>elbow</b> dislocation. Following open reduction and internal fixation, a hinged <b>elbow</b> fixator was applied, and patient immediately started with active mobilization exercises. Case three is a 49 -year old women with <b>elbow</b> stiffness and joint ingruency following persistent joint instability after a simple <b>elbow</b> dislocation. After arthrolysis, a hinged <b>elbow</b> fixator was mounted. In conclusion, early mobilization exercises after an <b>elbow</b> dislocation is mandatory to full functional recovery. Plaster immobilization should not be used. In case of persistent instability, a hinged external fixator is indicated...|$|R

50|$|The <b>elbow</b> {{includes}} prominent landmarks {{such as the}} olecranon (the bony prominence at {{the very}} tip of the <b>elbow),</b> the <b>elbow</b> pit, the lateral and medial epicondyles, and the <b>elbow</b> joint.

The <b>elbow</b> joint is the is the synovial hinge joint between the humerus in the upper arm and the radius and ulna in the forearm which allows the forearm and hand to be moved {{towards and away from}} the body.
