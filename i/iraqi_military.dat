5|$|After its {{deployment}} in the Korean War, {{the division}} {{was active in}} Europe and the United States during the Cold War, but saw relatively little combat until the Persian Gulf War, when it faced the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military.</b> A few years after that conflict, it was inactivated {{as part of the}} post-Cold War U.S. military drawdown of the 1990s. The division was reactivated in October 1999 as a formation for training and deploying U.S. Army National Guard units before its deactivation in October 2006.|$|E
5|$|As {{a symbol}} of the Caliph's ritual role {{as the leader of the}} Muslim community, they were closely paralleled in {{official}} propaganda by the leadership by Abbasid family members of the annual pilgrimage (hajj) to Mecca. In addition, the constant warfare on the Syrian marches was useful to the Abbasids as it provided employment for the Syrian and <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military</b> elites and the various volunteers (muṭṭawi‘a) who flocked to participate in the jihad.|$|E
5|$|Iraqi–British {{relations}} {{entered a}} short cooling-down period {{during and after}} the crisis. The Iraqis were previously encouraged by the British to detain Patriarch Shimun in order to defuse tensions. The British were also wary of <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military</b> leaders and recommended Sidqi, a senior ethnic Kurdish general who was stationed in Mosul, be transferred to another region due to his open animosity towards the Assyrians. Later, they had to intervene to dissuade Faysal from personally leading a tribal force to punish the Assyrians.|$|E
50|$|Psychological Operations was {{extremely}} valuable during the Gulf War {{due to the}} <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military's</b> desire to avoid combat. Through leaflets and loudspeaker broadcasts, PSYOP forces walked many enemy soldiers through successful surrender.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} Operation Desert Storm, F-15E crews {{observing the}} <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military's</b> {{massacre}} of Kurdish civilians at Chamchamal were forbidden from firing on the attackers, but instead used their lasers as a dazzler weapon. This ultimately proved ineffective in crashing any attack helicopters.|$|R

5|$|On 7 April 1991, Iraq {{accepted}} United Nations (UN) cease-fire {{conditions and}} resolutions, thereby officially ending the Gulf War. This same day, a large multinational, multiple-agency humanitarian effort {{under the authority}} of UN Security Council Resolution No. 688 began to aid the approximately 500,000 Kurdish refugees who had fled from <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military</b> forces into the hills of northern Iraq. On 18 April 1991, John Shalikashvili took command of the U.S.-led operation to ensure security for UN relief operations and the Kurdish refugees, called Operation Provide Comfort (OPC).|$|E
5|$|The ADF was {{subsequently}} {{involved in the}} reconstruction of Iraq. From 2003 until 2005 this was mainly limited to a Security Detachment which protected the Australia embassy, the attachment of officers to multi-national headquarters, small numbers of transport and maritime patrol aircraft, and teams of air traffic controllers and medical personnel. From 2005 until 2008 a battalion-sized Australian Army battle group (initially designated the Al Muthanna Task Group, and later Overwatch Battle Group (West)) was stationed in southern Iraq. In addition, teams of ADF personnel were deployed to train <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military</b> units. In line with a promise made at the 2007 election, the Rudd Government withdrew combat-related forces from Iraq in mid-2008, {{and most of the}} remaining Australian units left the country the next year.|$|E
5|$|The ADF {{currently}} has several forces deployed to the Middle East. The ADF's {{contribution to the}} Military intervention against ISIL makes up the largest overseas commitment with 780 personnel deployed as part of Operation Okra. As of November 2015, six F/A-18A Hornets, one E-7A Wedgetail and one KC-30A tanker were deployed to strike Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria. Approximately 380 personnel were deployed to Iraq {{as part of an}} international effort to provide training and other forms of assistance to the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military.</b> Deployments in Afghanistan number 250 personnel in Operation Highroad, a non-combat training mission supporting the Afghan National Army. A frigate is also deployed to the Middle East in maritime security operations in and around the Gulf of Aden as part of the Combined Maritime Forces. Australian personnel also form part of peacekeeping missions in Israel, Jordan, Egypt and Sudan. The ADF has a further 400 personnel based in the Middle East to support operations in the region.|$|E
5000|$|Along {{with the}} aircraft, 69 special forces advisors were {{deployed}} as training advisors to <b>Iraqi</b> <b>militaries.</b> Their {{mission was to}} aid in the [...] "planning of operations, train forces and to enable airstrikes, both in defence and on the offensive." [...] However, in the initial motion that was approved by the House of Commons, it was stated that Canada would not deploy ground troops in combat operations.|$|R
50|$|Jordanians {{have donated}} 250 armored {{personnel}} carriers to the Iraqi Ministry of Defense. The vehicles consisted of 50 Ukrainian-built BTR-94 {{armored personnel carriers}}, 100 British Spartans, and 100 American-made M113A1 armored personnel carriers. Jordan also donated two C-130B Hercules transport aircraft to the Iraqi Air Force, as well as 16 UH-1H utility helicopters. Jordanians have helped train Iraqi security forces by hosting Iraqi police and border-enforcement training in Jordan. Outside the Jordanian capital of Amman, the first all-female <b>Iraqi</b> army <b>military</b> police company was formed and trained by female Jordanian military personnel. Royal Jordanian aircrews have trained some Iraqi air force pilots, and Jordanian noncommissioned officers helped train the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military's</b> NCO corps in various locations in Iraq.|$|R
2500|$|After {{the initial}} invasion, {{most of the}} <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military's</b> former {{soldiers}} and officers offered little resistance to Coalition forces {{in the early days}} of the occupation. Many soldiers had simply gone home rather than openly fight the invading forces. This seeming acceptance of Coalition authority stemmed from the US military continuing to pay the salaries of Saddam's former soldiers, while promising senior Iraqi officers that they would have a major role to play [...] "in building a new Iraq." ...|$|R
5|$|The <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military</b> quickly proved {{no match}} for {{coalition}} military power, and with their defeat the bulk of Australian forces were withdrawn. While Australia did not initially {{take part in the}} post-war occupation of Iraq, an Australian Army light armoured battlegroup—designated the Al Muthanna Task Group and including 40 ASLAV light armoured vehicles and infantry—was later deployed to Southern Iraq in April 2005 as part of Operation Catalyst. The role of this force was to protect the Japanese engineer contingent in the region and support the training of New Iraqi Army units. The AMTG later became the Overwatch Battle Group (West) (OBG(W)), following the hand back of Al Muthanna province to Iraqi control. Force levels peaked at 1,400 personnel in May 2007 including the OBG(W) in Southern Iraq, the Security Detachment in Baghdad and the Australian Army Training Team—Iraq. A RAN frigate was based in the North Persian Gulf, while RAAF assets included C-130H Hercules and AP-3C elements. Following the election of a new Labor government under Prime Minister Kevin Rudd the bulk of these forces were withdrawn by mid-2009, while RAAF and RAN operations were redirected {{to other parts of the}} Middle East Area of Operations as part of Operation Slipper.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{believing the}} Iraqi Army would only {{advance to the}} Ramallah oil field, Schwarzkopf was {{surprised}} when the Iraqis captured Kuwait City. Fearing Iraq would next invade Saudi Arabia, Schwarzkopf ordered contingency plans put in motion, with the 82nd Airborne Division, 101st Airborne Division and 24th Infantry Division put on alert. He was then called to an emergency meeting with President George H. W. Bush, where his Internal Look '90 strategic plans were made {{the basis of a}} potential counteroffensive plan. By August 5, Bush opted for an aggressive response to the invasion. Schwarzkopf then accompanied Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney to meet with Saudi King Fahd to convince him to allow U.S. troops into Saudi Arabia to counter the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military.</b> With Fahd's consent, Bush ordered troops into Saudi Arabia on August 7, initially tasked to defend Saudi Arabia should Iraq attack. U.S. commanders from the beginning wanted a quick conflict characterized by decisive, overwhelming force, as opposed to the gradual escalation of U.S. involvement as had been seen in Vietnam. Schwarzkopf in particular was very adamant that many of the policies governing military operations in Vietnam, especially slow escalation of air power and troop force, not reoccur. His plan for direct and overwhelming force was initially criticized in Washington as uncreative. By August 13, the news media began to closely cover Schwarzkopf, who had been named to lead the operation.|$|E

25|$|During the Iran–Iraq War, Khuzestan was {{the focus}} of the Iraqi {{invasion}} of Iran, leading to the flight of thousands of the province's residents. As a result, Khuzestan suffered the heaviest damage of all Iranian provinces during the war. Iraq's President Saddam Hussein felt confident that the Arab population of the Khuzestan would react enthusiastically to the prospect of union with Iraq. However, resistance to the invasion was fierce, stalling the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>military's</b> advance, and ultimately opening a window of opportunity for an Iranian counter-offensive.|$|R
5000|$|Several {{media outlets}} {{including}} Al Jazeera and Channel 4 live streamed the first day's battle on Facebook, a first in war coverage. Additional live video feeds were available on YouTube and the streaming app Periscope. Iraqi and Kurdish officials are also joining in {{on social media}} using the hashtag #FreeMosul.
