40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} psychological {{research that}} can help people make better decisions. Decision analysts typically: 1) elicit outcome probabilities; 2) assess attribute weights; and 3) suggest the option with the highest overall value. Decision analysis can be challenging because of environmental <b>and</b> psychological issues. <b>Fast</b> <b>and</b> frugal methods such as natural frequency formats, frugal multiattribute models, <b>and</b> <b>fast</b> <b>and</b> frugal decision trees can address these issues. Not only are the methods <b>fast</b> <b>and</b> frugal, {{but they can also}} produce results that are surprisingly close to or even better than those obtained by more extensive analysis. Apart from raising awareness of these findings among engineers, the authors also call for further research on the application of <b>fast</b> <b>and</b> frugal methods to decision analysis.

5|$|Following the {{construction}} of the high-speed Gardermoen Line from Oslo, via Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, to Eidsvoll, the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications started planning additional high-speed lines west and southeast of Oslo. The Asker and Follo Lines would allow express and regional trains to travel <b>faster</b> <b>and</b> more reliably to Drammen and Ski, leaving the old tracks for slower freight trains, and commuter trains making frequent stops. Construction of the Follo Line will, at the earliest, be completed in 2015.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Fasting</b> <b>and</b> {{diabetes}} {{are characterized}} by elevated glucocorticoids and reduced insulin, leptin, elevated hypothalamic AGRP and NPY mRNA, and reduced hypothalamic POMC mRNA. Although leptin replacement can reverse changes in hypothalamic gene expression associated with <b>fasting</b> <b>and</b> diabetes, leptin also normalizes corticosterone; therefore {{the extent to which}} the elevated corticosterone contributes to the regulation of hypothalamic gene expression in <b>fasting</b> <b>and</b> diabetes remains unclear. To address if elevated corticosterone is necessary for hypothalamic responses to <b>fasting</b> <b>and</b> diabetes, we assessed the effects of adrenalectomy on hypothalamic gene expression in 48 -hour-fasted or diabetic mice. To assess if elevated corticosterone is sufficient for the hypothalamic responses to <b>fasting</b> <b>and</b> diabetes, we assessed the effect of corticosterone pellets implanted for 48 hours on hypothalamic gene expression. Results <b>Fasting</b> <b>and</b> streptozotocin-induced diabetes elevated plasma glucocorticoid levels and reduced serum insulin and leptin levels. Adrenalectomy prevented the rise in plasma glucocorticoids associated with <b>fasting</b> <b>and</b> diabetes, but not the associated reductions in insulin or leptin. Adrenalectomy blocked the effects of <b>fasting</b> <b>and</b> diabetes on hypothalamic AGRP, NPY, and POMC expression. Conversely, corticosterone implants induced both AGRP and POMC mRNA (with a non-significant trend toward induction of NPY mRNA), accompanied by elevated insulin and leptin (with no change in food intake or body weight). Conclusion These data suggest that elevated plasma corticosterone mediate some effects of <b>fasting</b> <b>and</b> diabetes on hypothalamic gene expression. Specifically, elevated plasma corticosterone is necessary for the induction of NPY mRNA with <b>fasting</b> <b>and</b> diabetes; since corticosterone implants only produced a non-significant trend in NPY mRNA, it remains uncertain if a rise in corticosterone may be sufficient to induce NPY mRNA. A rise in corticosterone is necessary to reduce hypothalamic POMC mRNA with <b>fasting</b> <b>and</b> diabetes, but not sufficient for the reduction of hypothalamic POMC mRNA. Finally, elevated plasma corticosterone is both necessary and sufficient for the induction of hypothalamic AGRP mRNA with <b>fasting</b> <b>and</b> diabetes. </p...|$|R

5|$|A 1993 study {{proposed}} that the higher frequency of tooth breakage among Pleistocene carnivores compared with living carnivores was {{not the result of}} hunting larger game, something that might be assumed from the larger size of the former.

5|$|A horse tramway {{was built}} in 1880 by Wigan Corporation and leased to a {{succession}} of private companies to operate services to Pemberton, Aspull and towards Standish. Steam tram operation was introduced quickly, but the network always struggled to pay its way and just {{after the start of}} the 20th century Wigan Corporation gradually bought the operating leases and converted the network to electric tramcar operation. However, the network was saddled with a mix of 'standard' gauge and 'narrow' gauge lines, reducing efficiency and increasing costs, and the last of the Wigan Corporation Tramways were closed in 1931 to be replaced by buses which had begun as 'feeder' services to the trams but which had shown themselves to be <b>faster</b> <b>and</b> more flexible. Trolleybuses were operated on a single route from Wigan to Martland Mill from 1925 to 1931.|$|E
5|$|A unique {{feature of}} the Homunculus {{is the ability to}} measure the {{spectrum}} of the central object at different latitudes by the reflected spectrum from different portions of the lobes. These clearly show a polar wind where the stellar wind is <b>faster</b> <b>and</b> stronger at high latitudes thought to be due to rapid rotation causing gravity brightening towards the poles. In contrast the spectrum shows a higher excitation temperature closer to the equatorial plane. By implication the outer envelope of Eta Carinae A is not strongly convective as that would prevent the gravity darkening. The current axis of rotation of the star does not appear to exactly match the alignment of the Homunculus. This may be due to interaction with Eta Carinae B which also modifies the observed stellar winds.|$|E

5|$|According to Caltrain, the {{electrification}} {{project will}} bring multiple {{benefits to the}} corridor. Firstly, electric trains can accelerate and decelerate more quickly than the existing diesel locomotives, resulting in <b>faster</b> <b>and</b> more frequent service. They will also replace Caltrain's current diesel locomotives and passenger cars, {{a significant portion of}} which are nearing the end of their lives. Additionally, electric trainsets are quieter and produce less air pollution that diesel locomotives, and the use of electric trains will lower Caltrain's fuel costs while increasing passenger revenue, due to an expected increase in ridership. Once complete, Caltrain expects to annually reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 176,000 metric tons and increase daily ridership by 21% by 2040. Daily service may be restored to Atherton and Broadway stations. Caltrain plans to complete the project by the end of 2021.|$|E

5|$|Amphetamine {{stimulates the}} {{medullary}} respiratory centers, producing <b>faster</b> <b>and</b> deeper breaths.

If intestinal activity is high, amphetamine may reduce gastrointestinal motility (the rate at which content moves through the digestive system); however, amphetamine may increase motility when the smooth muscle of the tract is relaxed. Amphetamine also has a slight analgesic effect and can enhance the pain relieving effects of opioids.|$|E
