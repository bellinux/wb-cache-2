40|$|Economic {{integration}} typically {{goes along}} with disintegration of production through outsourcing and offshoring (Feenstra 1998). As horizontal and vertical links between firms {{become more and more}} pronounced, value chains within regions are increasingly organized by production and innovation clusters. On the basis of a literature overview, we argue that in a world of economic integration clusters can be expected to play a prominent role.

As indicated by numerous empirical studies, the characteristics of clusters differ substantially. In order to overcome the fuzziness of the concept we suggest a bottom-up methodology of cluster identification using a set of qualitative and quantitative indicators. Given that many kinds of barriers to interregional and international trade are becoming less and less important and transport cost are falling, modern production clusters tend to have a higher geographical extension than traditional ones. We therefore raise the question of whether clustering is relevant for economic integration on the regional, national and supra-national level.

40|$|The {{degree of}} {{localisation}} of manufacturing, {{defined as the}} excess geographic concentration remaining after correcting for both sectorial concentration and the agglomeration of overall economic activity, has recently gained new techniques of measurement. These techniques are illustrated and theoretically discussed. The paper then investigates the sectorial scale of localisation, using evidence from two British sectors, SIC 244 (pharmaceutical) and 334 (optical and photographic), and respective sub-sectors. Applying the measures, it is evidenced that the individual sub-sectors are very differently localized both in extent and in location, even within the same sector. In addition to this, with survey data the paper shows that localisation is due to different economic explanations in different sub-sectors. This is a proof that the <b>economic</b> factors behind <b>localisation</b> are in this case at 5 -digit level, making economically not meaningful the measurement of localisation at a different scale. The study implies that identifying localisation remains a delicate process, since the right sectorial scale has to be detected case by case, the use {{of more than one}} technique usually gives additional insights and, finally, the survey confirms that, in field studies, a mix of diferent theoretical models is generally needed to explain the observed patterns. ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} that many analyses on enterprise statistics has to face today is the difficulty to evaluate the loosing of information suffered moving from micro-data to macro-data: these aggregates, substituting the total set of elementary data summing up their informative content, are defined {{on the basis of}} a list of items, collected in a general frame that we usually call a statistical classification. In reality, not always this informative content is reproduced in its total part: during the passage from the elementary data to the aggregated ones a lot of relevant information can be lost; in other words, a part of not observable heterogeneity is the implicit cost of using a synthetic of elementary indicators, in terms of unobservable different individual behaviours. The economic classifications play a fundamental role: among the different inspiration criteria, there is one given by the possibility, at least in theory, to describe the different dynamics about particular groups of elementary units, pooled by the belonging to the same typology. This typology can depend on the sector of <b>economic</b> activity, the <b>localisation,</b> the number of persons employed, and/or other characters specific of the dominion of relevant information.

40|$|This paper {{engages with}} the {{progressive}} politics {{of climate change}} and resource constraint developed by the Transition 'movement' which looks to develop a positive local politics of {{the transition to a}} low carbon economy and society. At the heart of this politics is a vision of <b>economic</b> <b>localisation</b> rooted in a geographical imaginary of market towns with agricultural hinterlands. Consequently, the question of how the Transition model can be applied in urban settings has not been clear, leading to the implicit assumption that urban Transition initiatives are more complex and difficult. In contrast, this paper argues that the plasticity of Transition politics means that, in some cases, an urban context might be more productive for the development of Transition initiatives because it allows for a greater diversity of political action as well as providing a density of networks and resources that can be critical for the survival of grassroots interventions. © 2013 Urban Studies Journal Limited...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the end of}} World War II, {{trillions of}} dollars have been poured into {{development}} schemes by multinational development banks, bilateral aid agencies, and private enterprises. Revolutionary new technologies have transformed the at!agriculture industry and service sectors alike. Tariffs have been drastically reduced and vast transnational corporations have systematically replaced national corporations that catered for the domestic economy. Similarly, the nation states have largely replaced small companies that catered for the domestic economy and governments {{seem to have been}} ignored. If conventional wisdom held true, then the world should have been transformed into a veritable paradise. Poverty, unemployment, malnutrition, homelessness, disease and environmental disruption should be but vat!ue memories of an underdeveloped past. But, to the contrary, these problems have become more serious and more widespread. The service delivery and social welfare ideals of the traditional nation states seem to be far from being realised. This article explores reasons why the signing of the Uruguay Round of General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATI) by Governments has further stalled the envisaged accelerated global economic growth and development through the gobalisation process, by removing all constraints on trade, regardless of social, ecological and moral implications. Instead of accepting the incontrovertible empirical evidence that economic globalisation will only increase many of the problems that face the world today, governments under pressure from transnational corporations insist on pursuing it further. To solve these problems, society will have to follow almost the very opposite path. Instead of seeking to create a single global economy controlled by vast and ever less controllable transnational corporations, it should seek to create a diversity of loosely linked, community-based economies managed by much smaller companies and catering above all (though not exclusively) for local or regional markets. It is not economic globalisation that society should aim for but the reverse, <b>economic</b> <b>localisation</b> to counter-balance today's substantially unfettered globalisation...|$|E
40|$|The {{authors have}} studied the effects of global {{economic}} development on individuals and cultures {{for the last three}} decades and have concluded that the most strategic and effective way of building a more positive future is through <b>economic</b> <b>localisation.</b> Fundamentally, localisation is about decentralising economic activity – producing for people's needs in a way that can been adapted to the ecological, cultural and political structures and needs of each locale. The paper is focused mainly on the disastrous impacts of the global economy on food and agriculture around the world. Adequate, wholesome food is vital to human well-being. There is nothing else that human beings produce that is needed by every person on the planet every day, yet that very activity has been relegated to a marginal position in political governance. Most businesses and governments consider agriculture little more than a stumbling block to success in their international trade negotiations. In fact, it is large-scale monocultural farms producing food for export that are inefficient. This industrial model of production is responsible for dramatic increases in environmental pollution, species extinction and even many human degenerative diseases, and only seems 'efficient' because so many of the costly subsidies that support it are hidden from view. Before examining the consequences of the global food system, the authors look at another subject equally worthy of attention: the social costs of globalisation, and the consumer monoculture it promotes. Social cohesion or a sense of community is fundamental to human well-being, indeed to human happiness. As we shall see, globalisation has done much to fragment community and erode people’s sense of self-esteem. Rebuilding or maintaining community is inextricably connected to a process of localisation. Many people around the world have looked to the King's aspiration to foster Gross National Happiness in Bhutan for hope and inspiration. In terms of shifting direction towards a more positive future, Bhutan is in an ideal position. Neither farming nor the fabric of community has been destroyed in Bhutan as it has {{in other parts of the}} world. There is a vital opportunity to strengthen the structures that support community and local economies in the country, thus averting the social, ecological and economic collapse globalisation has brought about elsewhere...|$|E

Variants may pertain to the <b>localisation,</b> <b>economic</b> aspects {{as well as the}} actual construction and design solutions. This article deals with the question of selecting the localisation for a construction project consisting of building a plant for thermal treatment of waste. In order to chose an optimal location, first we must establish assessment criteria which will guide us through a supported choice procedure, and next we should apply a method for the evaluation of variant solutions. Some criteria refer to measurable phenomena and are therefore easy to be defined and weighed. Others require descriptions, designating the right scale and proper methods for their identification. The article contains an example of a set of criteria and a case study of using multi-criteria analytical methods for selecting the location to develop a specific construction project such as a Waste Thermal Treatment Plant. Some well-known methods are compared with the approach proposed by the author. The methods applied in analyses have certain advantages and disadvantages. Irrespective of which method is applied, a reliable and trustworthy analysis of the location for a future construction project brings about many benefits. Such an analysis creates an opportunity to become aware of problems and obstacles which one may come across both while executing the project and in the many years to come, when the raised construction is used...|$|R

40|$|ResumenLos márgenes de ciudades configuran paisajes complejos, de transición entre lo rural, lo natural y lo urbano, con límites difusos y en mutua interdependencia. El Convenio europeo del paisaje concede gran importancia a los paisajes cotidianos, entre los que se encuentran los de carácter periurbano. Existe un número limitado de experiencias de valoración estética en paisajes periurbanos, hecho que sorprende teniendo en cuenta la abundancia e importancia de los mismos. La investigación que presentamos se basa en una metodología, centrada en el uso de sistemas de información geográfica (SIG), apropiada para valorar estéticamente dichas áreas, y con utilidad en planeamiento territorial. Su {{principal}} interés radica en ofrecer una doble valoración, según calidad y fragilidad del paisaje, y en su elevada sistematicidad. El procedimiento se aplica en Muntanyes d’Ordal, en la Región Metropolitana de Barcelona (España), un área de fuertes tensiones territoriales y valores paisajísticos contrastados. Los resultados obtenidos son de gran aplicabilidad e indican un predominio de los valores medios, tanto de calidad como de fragilidad del paisaje. AbstractLandscape's quality {{plays an}} important role in <b>economic</b> activities <b>localisation,</b> mainly in extraordinary or reputed sceneries. In degraded, everyday and suburban landscapes, landscape's quality is also deep important because indirectly determines where activities may be located, for example using selected viewsheds to discard impacting activities. European landscape convention gives remarkable importance to everyday landscapes, mentioning them in its Preamble, Article 2 and 6. The aim of this paper is to show a proceeding especially planned to asses landscape quality in degraded and everyday landscapes, without outstanding aesthetic values but important in quality of life because being placed in suburban areas. To this end visual landscape approach is yielded, using gis techniques and validating results in Muntanyes d’Ordal, in Barcelona's metropolitan region (Spain). An indirect landscape assessment procedure is developed, considering landscape from a quality and fragility point of view. Landscape quality refers to intrinsic values; landscape fragility refers to responses to changes. Both, quality and fragility are of interest in urban planning: the former gives information about most interesting areas from a landscape's values point of view and the later from urban planning perspective. Besides that, also physiographic and ecologic landscape values have been also considered. Ground work has provided the most of the information, collecting data at 1 : 5, 000 accuracy. Vector and raster data models have been used, creating final maps of 10 m pixels and 1 : 10, 000 accuracy. Microstation v 8 © Bentley and ArcGis 10 © ESRI software has been used. Landscape quality has been assessed giving positives values to land cover, vegetation, relief and terrain structure. Also punctual elements have been considered, according to local inhabitant's perception. In general terms, forested areas, contrasted relief, cliffs and eye-catching colours in rocks have been positively valuated in a 1 to 5 scale range. Viewsheds from positive and negative considered elements have been calculated, giving a + 2 punctuation to the positive ones and - 1 to the negative ones. Landscape fragility has been assessed considering those variables which increase or decrease visual absorption, such as height vegetation, slope or aspect, in a 1 to 5 scale range. Viewsheds have been calculated from peaks, gazers, urban areas, and roads. Eventually both layers have been combined and new values reclassified. Finally quality and fragility landscape's maps have been synthesised, in order to make results easy to understand and use in urban planning. Values harmonisation has been done considering that low quality values and low fragility values mean high aptitude to receive new urban planning and, inversely, high quality values and high fragility values mean low aptitude to receive new planning. Final results have been classified in five categories legend, from very low to very height. A 5. 97 % of the studied area has a very high aptitude to receive new urban developments, whereas the most of the studied area (44. 71 % and 25. 08 %) have high and medium values. The studied area contains some protected areas, which mean 65. 29 % of very high or high values to receive new planning. Those areas, because being protected, should be discarded in new planning. On the contrary, outside protected areas, more than 50 % of the studied area has high values to receive new planning. That means beside landscape values, those areas are adjacent to already built up areas or in a distance lower to 50 m, so new planning is desirable to take place within. Exercises like this one have an important applied value and are a good tool in urban planning, especially in degraded, suburban and everyday landscapes, because prevent from a landscape improvement and helps to a well-being and quality landscapes...|$|R
