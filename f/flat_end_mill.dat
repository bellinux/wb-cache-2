40|$|Abstract. Generally, {{ball end}} mills {{are used for}} free-form surface {{machining}}. When machining curved surfaces with large curvature change using ball end mills, {{it is necessary to}} use tools with larger curvature of the cutting edges than the maximum curvature of the surface and minute pick feeds or to change tools for fitting the curvature of one part of the surface. However this causes poor machining efficiency. The curvature of the cutting edge of a <b>flat</b> <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> can be fitted to the curvature of a point on machined surfaces by adjusting the tool posture. Therefore, flat end mills can efficiently cut almost all curvature curved surfaces without tool change. This paper proposes two methods for deciding tool posture and tool path for 5 -axis control machining based on minimum cusp height. To decide the tool path, one method defines tool paths along isoparametric curved lines, while the other defines tool paths along curved lines along the minimum curvature direction.

Micro-milling is a promising method to create these scaled down structures, sensors, and parts. Yet, micromilling still confronts some significant difficulties, tormenting further provision of this innovation. The most noticeable around them is micro burr formation. Burrs created along the completed edges and surfaces in micro-milling operation have huge {{effect on the}} surface quality and performance of the completed parts and microstructures. In any case, deburring of micro-parts is not conceivable because of bad accessibility and tight tolerances in micro segments.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to further reduce the machining cycle time for producing Calcium Polyphosphate (CPP) implant constructs. To achieve this, the impregnation of the CPP lattice with various polymers is investigated, {{with the aim of}} improving the toughness of the material. By applying Taguchi’s orthogonal array method it was determined that CPP infiltrated with an ionic bonding polymer produces the best material for generating high quality machined surfaces and features. While there is some loss in surface porosity, in comparison to cutting uninfiltrated CPP, the porosity loss was deemed acceptable for the clinical purpose of the implant, and in many cases, would be trimmed off during a consecutive finish machining operation. The 2 fluted 4 mm diameter <b>flat</b> <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> at a cutting speed of 30 m/min and ¾ immersion up-milling, 0. 1 mm chip load and 3 mm depth of cut were determined to be highly suitable for achieving both high productivity as well as excellent surface integrity.

The constructed machining model was highly successful in predicting the cutting forces, and therefore can be used in process planning and optimization in the production of tissue engineered implant constructs out of CPP. The Finite Element analyses predicted that the implant would not chip or break during the roughing operation, as validated experimentally. This allowed the roughing cycle time to be reduced from 159 min to 19 min, effectively achieving a productivity improvement of 8 times over the earlier work done in this area...|$|E

High speed machining (HSM) is capable of producing parts that require little or no grinding/lapping operations within the required machining tolerances.

Chatter prediction models need certain process, tool and workpiece related information. Tool tip frequency response function FRF is the key input information for cutting dynamics and chatter stability analyses.

40|$|Micro milling {{operation}} {{is one of}} the advanced machining processes to manufacture miniature parts in biomedical, optics and electronics industries. The chip thickness in micro milling is comparable to the tool edge radius, which brings strong size effect to the cutting performance and makes prediction of the cutting forces more challenging. In this thesis, an analysis of the micro milling process has been carried out based on an experimental study to cut different materials using micro <b>flat</b> <b>end</b> <b>mills</b> on a precision CNC machine tool. Influences of cutting parameters on cutting forces and machined surface quality have been evaluated. A cutting force model has been developed by determine the key coefficients from finite element method, with a simulation study and model verification presented. It has been found that cutting forces occurred at low feed per tooth are relatively high by assessing the averaged peak forces from the experiments. When feed per tooth is relatively close to tool edge radius, the forces were not growing in linearity with the increasing feedrate. This finding indicates the significance of ploughing phenomenon as an effect of tool edge radius in micro milling. Also, machining at high spindle speed may contribute to process instability and significant peak force variation, and have negative effect on work surface quality. Moreover, the workpiece machined by 0. 9 mm diameter tool achieved better surface quality than those done by 0. 6 mm tool. It is shown that reducing depth of cut can reduce burr formation. In addition, the width of deformed chips has been measured considerably close to the depth of cut value. To investigate the size effect on cutting performance, the prediction of cutting forces derives from a simplified orthogonal process. A finite element model is developed to simulate two-dimensional cutting forces in orthogonal micro cutting of brass, which has addressed the ploughing and tool edge effects. The FE model is used to evaluate the critical chip thickness and to extract the two force coefficients for modelling cutting forces in micro milling. A generalized analytical force model based on numerical findings is proposed to predict the micro milling force by considering the tool trajectory and tool runout. The cutting force coefficients are modelled as a function of instantaneous uncut chip thickness, which is independent of cutting speed but influenced by tool edge radius. The simulation results of micro milling forces are compared against experimental measurement, where an agreement of force trends is shown along with the increasing feedrate and depth of cut...|$|R

The four axis linkage {{grinding}} simulation {{system of}} ball-nose <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> has be developed {{based on the}} mathematical model of four axis linkage grinding through establishing ball-nose <b>end</b> <b>mill's</b> parametrical database, constructing ball-nose <b>end</b> <b>mill’s</b> and grinding wheel's solid models in Solidworks, simulating the grinding processes of the rake face and flank face of ball-nose <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> based on Boolean operation, and automatic NC programming of rake face and flank face grinding. The results show the grinding simulation system {{can be used to}} manufacture ball <b>end</b> <b>mill...</b>|$|R
40|$|Milling {{tests were}} run on {{families}} of High Speed Steel (HSS) <b>end</b> <b>mills</b> {{to determine their}} lives while machining 304 Stainless Steel. The <b>end</b> <b>mills</b> tested were made from M 7, M 42 and T 15 -CPM High Speed Steels. The <b>end</b> <b>mills</b> were also evaluated with no coatings {{as well as with}} Titanium Nitride (TiN) and Titanium Carbo-Nitride (TiCN) coatings to determine which combination of HSS and coating provided the highest increase in <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> life while increasing the cost of the tool the least. We found <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> made from M 42 gave us the largest increase in tool life with the least increase in cost. The results of this study will be used by Cutting Tool Engineering in determining which <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> descriptions will be dropped from our tool catalog...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{a cutting}} force model in ball <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> of mold cavity corner is established. Based on infinitesimal milling force model, cutting element of ball <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> cutter {{is treated as}} equal {{diameter}} <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> cutter, then determine the location of points when the micro-element participated in the cutting, and the tool-workpiece contact area and cutting range is determined. Thereby a complete milling force model in corner machining with ball <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> cutter is established...|$|R
