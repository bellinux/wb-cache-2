5|$|China has had {{an organ}} {{transplantation}} programme since the 1960s. It {{is one of the}} largest organ transplant programmes in the world, peaking at over 13,000 transplants a year in 2004. Involuntary organ harvesting is illegal under Chinese law, although under a 1984 regulation it became legal to remove organs from executed criminals with the prior consent of the criminal or permission of relatives. By the 1990s, growing concerns about possible ethical abuses arising from coerced consent and corruption led medical groups and human rights organizations to start condemning the practice. These concerns resurfaced in 2001, when The Washington Post reported claims by a Chinese asylum-seeking doctor that he had taken part in organ <b>extraction</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|E

25|$|The mining {{process is}} ideally {{modelled}} on the <b>extraction</b> <b>operations</b> underway in Australia, where the strip mining {{is followed by}} rehabilitation of the mined areas including intensive re-vegetation with ecologically similar species, re-contouring of the land to its original shape, including dunes, and management of groundwater resources. Modern mining practices tend to favor dry mining rather than dredging operations, due to the advent of electrostatic mineral separation processes.|$|E

25|$|By the 1990s, growing {{concerns}} about possible abuses arising from coerced consent and corruption led medical groups {{and human rights}} organizations to start condemning China’s use of prisoner organs. These concerns resurfaced in 2001, when a Chinese military doctor testified before U.S. Congress {{that he had taken}} part in organ <b>extraction</b> <b>operations</b> from executed prisoners, some of whom were not yet dead. In December 2005, China's Deputy Health Minister Huang Jiefu acknowledged that up to 95% of transplant organs came from executed prisoners and promised steps to prevent abuse. Huang reiterated these claims in 2008 and 2010, stating that over 90% of organ transplants from deceased donors are sourced from prisoners. In 2006 the World Medical Association demanded that China cease harvesting organs from prisoners, who are not deemed able to properly consent. In 2014, Huang Jiefu said that reliance on organ harvesting from death row inmates was declining, while simultaneously defending the practice of using prisoners’ organs in the transplantation system.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to this, there are lime and other <b>extraction</b> <b>operations</b> within the park’s borders. They exist legally {{because they had}} been there well before the park was established. [...] However, these operations have destroyed about 2,600 hectares. These operations produce noise, smoke, dust and small tremblers from explosions used to extract the minerals. Much of the environment damage come from runoff from mining waste which winds up in the Grijalva River. However the dust and smoke have produced a distinct white coating on surrounding flora.|$|E
2500|$|Bell/Agusta {{aimed the}} {{aircraft}} [...] "at {{the government and}} military markets". Another key market for the AW609 has been the expansion of offshore oil and gas <b>extraction</b> <b>operations,</b> which requires aircraft capable of the traversing the increasing distances involved. In 2001, Bell estimated a market for 1,000 aircraft. Bell/Agusta stated in 2007 that they intend for the BA609 to compete with corporate business jets and helicopters, and that the BA609 would {{be of interest to}} any operator that has a mixed fleet of fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft. In 2004, Lt. Gen. Michael Hough, USMC deputy commandant for aviation, requested that Bell conduct studies into arming the BA609, potentially to act as an escort for V-22s. However, AgustaWestland's deal with Bell for taking over the BA609 program precludes the aircraft from carrying arms.|$|E
