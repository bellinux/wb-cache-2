5000|$|Optical brighteners, optical <b>brightening</b> <b>agents</b> (OBAs), <b>fluorescent</b> <b>brightening</b> <b>agents</b> (FBAs), or <b>fluorescent</b> {{whitening}} agents (FWAs), are {{chemical compounds}} that absorb {{light in the}} ultraviolet and violet region (usually 340-370 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum, and re-emit light in the blue region (typically 420-470 nm) by fluorescence. Fluorescent emission is a short-lived period of light emission by a fluorophore, unlike phosphorescence, which is long-lived. These additives are often used to enhance the appearance of color of fabric and paper, causing a [...] "whitening" [...] effect; they make intrinsically yellow/orange materials look less so, by compensating the deficit in blue and purple light reflected by the material, with the blue and purple optical emission of the fluorophore.|$|R
40|$|Some protozoans {{are able}} to encyst as a {{protective}} response to a harmful environment. The cyst wall usually contains chitin as its main structural constituent. Acanthamoeba is an exception since its cyst wall contains cellulose. Specific cytochemical differentiation between cellulose and chitin by microscopy has not been possible due to the similarity of the constituent β- 1, 4 -linked hexose backbones of these molecules. Thus, various <b>fluorescent</b> <b>brightening</b> <b>agents</b> and lectins bind to both cellulose and chitin. The identification of Acanthamoeba spp., which is based primarily on morphological and biochemical features, is labor-intensive and requires cloning and axenization. We describe a novel immunocytochemical method for identification of Acanthamoeba spp. based on selective binding of Trichoderma reesei cellulase to protozoan cyst wall cellulose. A recombinant cellulose-binding protein consisting of two cellulose-binding domains (CBDs) from T. reesei cellulases was coupled to the fluorescent dyes Alexa Fluor 350 and Alexa Fluor 568 or was labeled with biotin using EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-biotin. No staining reaction was observed with chitin-containing preparations of fungi. Thus, the recombinant CBDs {{can be used as}} a marker to distinguish between cellulose and chitin.

The cyst wall usually contains chitin as its main structural constituent, but in some cases, as in Acanthamoeba, it consists of cellulose instead. Specific cytochemical differentiation between cellulose and chitin by microscopy has not been possible, due to the similarity of their constituent β- 1, 4 -linked hexose backbones. Thus, various <b>fluorescent</b> <b>brightening</b> <b>agents</b> and lectins bind to both cellulose and chitin. We have used a recombinant cellulose-binding protein consisting of two cellulose-binding domains (CBDs) from Trichoderma reesei cellulases linked together in combination with monoclonal anticellulase antibodies and anti-mouse immunoglobulin fluorescein conjugate to specifically stain cellulose in the cysts of Acanthamoeba strains for fluorescence microscopy imaging. Staining was observed in ruptured cysts and frozen sections of cysts but not in intact mature cysts. No staining reaction was observed with the chitin-containing cyst walls of Giardia intestinalis, Entamoeba dispar, or Pneumocystis carinii. Thus, the recombinant CBD {{can be used as}} a marker to distinguish between cellulose and chitin. Thirteen of 25 environmental or clinical isolates of amoebae reacted in the CBD binding assay. All 13 isolates were identified as Acanthamoeba spp. Five isolates of Hartmannella and seven isolates of Naegleria tested negative in the CBD binding assay. Whether cyst wall cellulose really is a unique property of Acanthamoeba spp. among free-living amoebae, as suggested by our findings, remains to be shown in more extensive studies...|$|R

Coumarin belongs to a class of flavonoids and a type of benzo- 2 -pyrone, which is a plant secondary metabolite isolated from natural plants and some microorganisms. For instance, the antibiotic novobiocin, coumermycin A 1, and chlorobiocin were isolated from microorganisms [1, 2]. Coumarin acts as a safeguard against viral, bacterial, and fungal attacks, wounds, and stress by a process called phytoalexins [3, 4]. The potential biological applications of coumarin were reported as platelet aggregation inhibition, antibacterial, anticancer, and antioxidant [7, 8]. Coumarin and its derivatives are widely used in synthetic, pharmaceutical, and agrochemicals industries and also used as optical <b>brightening</b> <b>agents,</b> insecticidal, additive in perfumes, and cosmetics [5, 6]. Coumarine serves as an intermediate in the synthesis of several organic reactions, i.e., furocoumarins, chromenes, coumarones, and 2 -acylresorcinols [9]. Calanolides, a polycyclic coumarin, exhibited potent anti-HIV (NNRTI) activity and was isolated from genus Calophyllum [10].|$|R

Then, phthalimide groups were linked to the resulting copolymers by the ring-opening reaction of the anhydride groups with sodium phthalimide salt. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) showed that the incorporation of phthalimide groups as side chains decreased the free volume of the polymers, and therefore, the rigidity and the glass transition temperature (Tg) are increased.|$|R

Color discrepancy as a result of OBAs is analyzed between D 50 and Illuminant A light sources, which are common to pressroom viewing conditions and customer environments. For toner-based digital printing, greater difference in color occurs between light sources when there is a lower percent coverage of ink on the paper.

40|$|The {{role of a}} color-managed inkjet {{proof is}} to predict and {{simulate}} the visual appearance of printed color. The proof-to-print visual match works well under different viewing conditions when the input ICC profile and the output ICC profile, built from characterization datasets, do not contain optical <b>brightening</b> <b>agents</b> (OBA). OBAs influence printed color when measured for characterization and viewed. These <b>brightening</b> <b>agents</b> absorb UV wavelengths in the illuminant and fluoresce in the blue wavelengths. As more and more OBAs are used in printing paper production, the role of color proofing becomes more difficult. The difference {{in the amount of}} the UV component of the measuring and viewing light sources cause a problem where the OBA effect, as measured, may not be the same amount of OBA effect that should be proofed under the viewing illuminant. There are two objectives in this research project. The first objective is to show how printed colors, under identical printing conditions on OBA and non-OBA substrates, look different than when they are proofed using current characterization for proofing practices. Both M 0 (UV-included) and M 2 (UV-cut) measurement data are collected from color patches with selected tonal values and input ICC profiles created from this data are used to proof the brightened reference print. The results show that the UV-cut characterization treatment produces a very poor proof to the reference, while the UV-included proof was ranked as a fairly high match. A third commercially available software designed to improve upon the UV-included treatment, the X-Rite Optical Brightened Compensation module, was also tested and found to be a good match to the reference as well. The second objective is to propose different ways the characterization data can be adjusted for the OBAs in a reference print on brightened paper, by accounting for the influence of UV in the measurement illuminant, and the influence of UV in the viewing illuminant. By means of psychometric analyses, the results show that (1) the proof-to- print match is the worst when OBA in print and UV in the measurement illuminant are not addressed (UV-cut characterization data from M 2); (2) although not conclusive, the proof-to-print match improves when OBA in print, UV in the measurement illuminant (characterization data from M 0), and UV in the viewing illuminant are addressed...|$|R
