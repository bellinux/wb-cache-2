5|$|Another {{hardware}} quirk produced one of {{the most}} distinctive aspects of the ZX81's screen display – during loading or saving, moving zigzag stripes appear across the screen. The same pin on the ULA is used to handle the video signal and the tape output, producing the stripes as an interference pattern of sorts. The ULA cannot maintain the display during SAVE and LOAD operations, as it has to operate continuously to maintain the correct baud rate <b>for</b> <b>data</b> transfers.

It was the fifth national population census exercise of Zambia since its independence in 1964, with the previous censuses conducted in 1969, 1980, 1990 and 2000. A total of 3.2 million questionnaires were used <b>for</b> <b>data</b> collection and the processing started in April 2011 by the Central Statistical Office.

5|$|The census {{enumeration}} {{was carried}} out from 16 October to 15 November 2010 by 25,000 school leavers and 8,400 census supervisors deputed by the Census Statistical Office of Zambia. Civil servants from various government departments trained the enumerators. There were two forms: Form A, which had basic details like full name, sex, membership status, expected to be answered by senior members of each household; Form B which had details about individual members of the family. When the respondent was a minor, proxy members having knowledge about the family were questioned. The details in form B were not sufficiently captured in the forms answered by the proxy members, most of whom did not have full information about all the family members. All buildings that were complete, incomplete, abandoned, habitable or inhabitable were accounted by the enumerators. Compared to the form used during 2000 census enumeration, there were additional details on death of household members, maternal deaths, albimism, orphanhood and fosterhood in the forms used in 2010. The enumeration was completed by 15 November 2010 for majority of the regions, while all the remaining {{regions of the country}} were completed by 30 November 2010. A total of 3.2 million questionnaires were used <b>for</b> <b>data</b> collection and the Central Statistical Office started processing the forms from April 2011.
