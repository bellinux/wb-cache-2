5|$|Although {{the issues}} the Dutch {{designers}} were <b>having</b> <b>with</b> a propulsion system were discussed, the delegation {{came away from}} Italy entirely uninspired by the Italians' efforts in that area. On the other hand, the visit provoked a drastic reworking of the internal subdivision of the proposed battlecruisers. The designers {{got rid of the}} previously required central longitudinal bulkhead and attempted to raise the double bottom to provide greater protection against magnetic torpedoes. However, due to the requirement for a shallow draft, this modification had to be abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Icke met {{his first}} wife, Linda Atherton, in May 1971 at a {{dance at the}} Chesford Grange Hotel near Leamington Spa; she {{was working as a}} van driver for a garage. Shortly after they met, Icke had another of the huge rows he had started <b>having</b> <b>with</b> his father—always a domineering man, his father was upset that Icke's {{arthritis}} was interfering with his football career—so he packed his bags and left home. He moved into a bedsit and worked in a travel agency, travelling to Hereford twice a week in the evenings to play football.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{interviews}} Hurley about a {{video of}} Laura and Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle); Hayward had denied him being present {{the day it was}} taken but Cooper notices a reflection of his motorcycle in the video. Cooper confronts Hurley about the affair he was <b>having</b> <b>with</b> Palmer, and about her cocaine habit. Hurley admits seeing Palmer the night she died but denies killing her. James' uncle Ed Hurley (Everett McGill) comes to the sheriff's department to pick his nephew up. Ed tells Truman that he was drugged the previous night at The Roadhouse, the town's bar; he suspects bartender Jacques Renault (Walter Olkewicz) was responsible. Cooper takes a telephone call from his colleague Albert Rosenfield, who {{is on his way to}} aid the investigation. Meanwhile, Briggs and his friend Mike Nelson (Gary Hershberger) are in a jail cell, discussing money they owe to Leo. The $10,000 they were meant to pay him is in a safe deposit box owned by Palmer, which they can now no longer access. They are later released by Cooper, who warns them not to approach James Hurley.|$|E

5|$|The {{purchase}} of the yacht caused Heidemann financial problems, and in 1976 he agreed terms with Gruner + Jahr, Sterns parent company, to produce a book based on the conversations he was <b>having</b> <b>with</b> the former soldiers and SS men. When the book went unwritten—the material provided by the former SS officer was not sufficiently interesting or verifiable for publication—Heidemann borrowed increasingly large sums from his employers {{to pay for the}} boat's upkeep. In June 1978 he advertised the boat for sale, asking 1.1million DMs; he received no offers. Mohnke recommended that Heidemann speak to Jakob Tiefenthaeler, a Nazi memorabilia collector and {{a former member of the}} SS. Tiefenthaeler was not in a position to buy the yacht, but was happy to act as an agent; his endeavours did not produce a sale. Realising Heidemann's financial circumstances, Tiefenthaeler provided him with names of other collectors in the Stuttgart area. The journalist made a trip to the south of Germany and met Stiefel, who purchased some of Göring's effects.|$|E

25|$|There are {{variety of}} reasons why {{patients}} fail to take their medication. The symptoms of TB commonly resolve {{within a few weeks}} of starting TB treatment and many patients then lose motivation to continue taking their medication. Regular follow-up is important to check on compliance and to identify any problems patients are <b>having</b> <b>with</b> their medication. Patients need to be told of the importance of taking their tablets regularly, and the importance of completing treatment, because of the risk of relapse or drug-resistance developing otherwise.|$|E

25|$|In 1883 {{he began}} experimenting with pea-whistle designs that could produce an intense sound that could grab {{attention}} from over a mile away. His invention {{was discovered by}} accident, when he accidentally dropped his violin and it shattered on the floor. Observing how the discordant sound of the breaking strings travelled (trill effect), Hudson had the idea to put a pea in the whistle. Prior to this, whistles were much quieter, and were only thought of as musical instruments or toys for children. After observing the problems that local police were <b>having</b> <b>with</b> effectively communicating with rattles, he realised that his whistle designs {{could be used as}} an effective aid to their work.|$|E
25|$|As {{at other}} stations, the {{commander}} of the fleet was provided with a residence and expected to entertain society. The admiral's house in the Strada Mezzodi was one of the smaller auberges, originally palaces for the Knights of St. John. The small size was a disadvantage for the lavish parties which Tryon and his wife were expected to host, but the parties held in the winters of 1891-92 and 92-93 were very popular. The admiral was the second most important person on the island, after the Governor. The admiral's other duties, aside from running the fleet, included corresponding with the director of Naval Intelligence, Captain Cyprian Bridge, passing on and receiving intelligence reports. This required replying personally to information received from his officers: he was described as a fast writer but with difficult handwriting. The correspondence covered everything from problems the Italian were <b>having</b> <b>with</b> their carrier pigeons to details of international law.|$|E

500|$|Because McClellan {{failed to}} pursue Lee aggressively after Antietam, Lincoln ordered {{that he be}} removed from command on November 5, 1862. Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside assumed command of the Army of the Potomac on November 9, 1862. McClellan wrote to his wife, [...] "Those in whose {{judgment}} I rely tell me that I fought the battle splendidly {{and that it was}} a masterpiece of art. ... I feel I have done all that can be asked in twice saving the country. ... I feel some little pride in <b>having,</b> <b>with</b> a beaten & demoralized army, defeated Lee so utterly. ...

500|$|Mostly unconcerned about {{appearance}} and manners, biographers suggest {{she focused on}} her studies. A distinguished algebraist Olga Taussky-Todd described a luncheon, during which Noether, wholly engrossed {{in a discussion of}} mathematics, [...] "gesticulated wildly" [...] as she ate and [...] "spilled her food constantly and wiped it off from her dress, completely unperturbed". Appearance-conscious students cringed as she retrieved the handkerchief from her blouse and ignored the increasing disarray of her hair during a lecture. Two female students once approached her during a break in a two-hour class to express their concern, but they were unable to break through the energetic mathematics discussion she was <b>having</b> <b>with</b> other students.|$|E

Go ahead, and I'll leave.'" [...] He compared his experience on Voyager to working in a car factory, and said that the repetitive scenes meant that it limited his creativity. Beltran explained that it did not affect his relationship with the other actors, and in the end, he felt the producers decided to keep him on the cast as it did not make [...] "very much difference, except to a very, very small percentage of fans who maybe didn't like what I said." ...|$|E

500|$|The philosopher Michael Ruse {{wrote in}} [...] (1988) that Bell et al.′s {{findings}} about the parental backgrounds of heterosexuals and homosexuals were [...] "slanted {{in the way}} a Freudian would expect", adding that many other studies have pointed to very similar conclusions. Ruse argued that there is much to support Bell et al.′s conclusion that Freudian explanations of homosexuality confuse the direction of cause and effect and that the cold and distant relationships gay men report <b>having</b> <b>with</b> their fathers are a result of parental reactions to effeminate or sensitive sons. However, he noted that the accuracy of Bell et al.′s findings is open to doubt for many reasons: their subjects could have been unwittingly giving them the answers they wanted to hear, failed to remember accurately, or suppressed painful childhood memories.|$|E

[...] The Quebec Bulldogs were in financial difficulty, [...] while the league's most popular team, the Toronto 228th Battalion, was called away {{to fight in}} World War I. [...] Several of the league's team owners were growing frustrated [...] with Toronto Blueshirts owner Eddie Livingstone, with whom they had been having problems since 1915. [...] Prior {{to the start of}} the season, the owners of the Montreal teams, Sam Lichtenhein of the Wanderers and George Kennedy of the Canadiens, threatened to drop the Blueshirts from the league over a player dispute Livingstone was <b>having</b> <b>with</b> the 228th Battalion. Livingstone was also in a dispute with the Ottawa Senators over the rights to Cy Denneny, while Kennedy and Livingstone had a mutual dislike that occasionally threatened to come to blows at league meetings.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in late April, a Union {{force of}} 100,000 moved slowly against Corinth, under Halleck's command with Grant relegated to second-in-command; Sherman {{commanded}} the division {{on the extreme}} right of the Union's right wing (under George H. Thomas). [...] Shortly after the Union forces occupied Corinth on May 30, Sherman persuaded Grant not to leave his command, despite the serious difficulties he was <b>having</b> <b>with</b> Halleck. Sherman offered Grant an example from his own life, [...] "Before the battle of Shiloh, I was cast down by a mere newspaper assertion of 'crazy', but that single battle gave me new life, and I'm now in high feather." [...] He told Grant that, if he remained in the army, [...] "some happy accident might restore you to favor and your true place". [...] In July, Grant's situation improved when Halleck left for the East to become general-in-chief, and Sherman became the military governor of occupied Memphis.|$|E
