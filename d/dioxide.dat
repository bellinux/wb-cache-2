5|$|Because it {{was used}} in glassmaking, {{manganese}} <b>dioxide</b> was available for experiments by alchemists, the first chemists. Ignatius Gottfried Kaim (1770) and Johann Glauber (17th century) discovered that manganese <b>dioxide</b> could be converted to permanganate, a useful laboratory reagent. By the mid-18th century, the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele used manganese <b>dioxide</b> to produce chlorine. First, hydrochloric acid, or a mixture of dilute sulfuric acid and sodium chloride was made to react with manganese <b>dioxide,</b> later hydrochloric acid from the Leblanc process was used and the manganese <b>dioxide</b> was recycled by the Weldon process. The production of chlorine and hypochlorite bleaching agents was a large consumer of manganese ores.|$|E

5|$|Industrial {{production}} of selenium usually involves {{the extraction of}} selenium <b>dioxide</b> from residues obtained during the purification of copper. Common production from the residue then begins by oxidation with sodium carbonate to produce selenium <b>dioxide,</b> which is mixed with water and acidified to form selenous acid (oxidation step). Selenous acid is bubbled with sulfur <b>dioxide</b> (reduction step) to give elemental selenium.|$|E

5|$|It {{is only as}} {{a result}} of {{accurately}} maintaining the composition of the 3 litres alveolar air that, with each breath, some carbon <b>dioxide</b> is discharged into the atmosphere and some oxygen is taken up from the outside air. If more carbon <b>dioxide</b> than usual has been lost by a short period of hyperventilation, breathing will be slowed down or halted until the alveolar partial pressure of carbon <b>dioxide</b> has returned to 5.3kPa (40mmHg). The opposite occurs after breath-holding.|$|E
5|$|Scheele {{and other}} chemists {{were aware that}} {{manganese}} <b>dioxide</b> contained a new element, {{but they were not}} able to isolate it. Johan Gottlieb Gahn was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774, by reducing the <b>dioxide</b> with carbon.|$|E
5|$|Sulfuric acid is {{produced}} in the upper atmosphere by the Sun's photochemical action on carbon <b>dioxide,</b> sulfur <b>dioxide,</b> and water vapour. Ultraviolet photons of wavelengths less than 169 nm can photodissociate carbon <b>dioxide</b> into carbon monoxide and atomic oxygen. Atomic oxygen is highly reactive; when it reacts with sulfur <b>dioxide,</b> a trace component of the Venusian atmosphere, the result is sulfur trioxide, which can combine with water vapour, another trace component of Venus's atmosphere, to yield sulfuric acid.|$|E

5|$|The Ganymedian surface albedo is very asymmetric; {{the leading}} {{hemisphere}} is {{brighter than the}} trailing one. This is similar to Europa, but the reverse for Callisto. The trailing hemisphere of Ganymede appears to be enriched in sulfur <b>dioxide.</b> The distribution of carbon <b>dioxide</b> does not demonstrate any hemispheric asymmetry, {{although it is not}} observed near the poles. Impact craters on Ganymede (except one) do not show any enrichment in carbon <b>dioxide,</b> which also distinguishes it from Callisto.

5|$|The {{invention}} of the Leclanché cell in 1866 and the subsequent improvement of the batteries containing manganese <b>dioxide</b> as cathodic depolarizer increased the demand of manganese <b>dioxide.</b> Until the development batteries with nickel-cadmium and lithium, most batteries contained manganese. The zinc-carbon battery and the alkaline battery normally use industrially produced manganese <b>dioxide</b> because natural occurring manganese <b>dioxide</b> contains impurities. In the 20th century, manganese <b>dioxide</b> was widely used as the cathodic for commercial disposable dry batteries of both the standard (zinc-carbon) and alkaline types.|$|E
5|$|The {{material}} {{ejected from}} the volcano mainly consisted of water vapor, along with smaller amounts of carbon <b>dioxide</b> and sulfur <b>dioxide.</b> Further study by airborne monitors suggests that the materials were not oxidized much, and little of the concentration contained sulfates, less than 20%.|$|E

40|$|Dibenzothiophene <b>dioxides,</b> {{which are}} readily {{prepared}} through oxidation {{of the parent}} dibenzothiophenes, undergo nucleophilic aromatic substitution with anilines intermolecularly and then intramolecularly to yield the corresponding carbazoles in a single operation.

Since electron-deficient thiaarene <b>dioxides</b> exhibit interesting reactivity, which is not observed for that the corresponding electron-rich azaarenes, {{a combination of a}} thiaarene-dioxide-specific reaction with the SN Ar-based aromatic metamorphosis allows transition-metal-free construction of difficult-to-prepare carbazoles...|$|R

The valencies of the rare earth ions are determined from total energy minimization. We find Ce, Pr, Tb in their <b>dioxides</b> to have the tetravalent configuration, while for all the sesquioxides the trivalent groundstate configuration is found to be the most favourable. The calculated lattice constants for these valency configurations are in good agreement with experiment. Total energy considerations are exploited to show the link between oxidation and $f$-electron delocalization, and explain why, among the <b>dioxides,</b> only the CeO$_ 2 $, PrO$_ 2 $, and TbO$_ 2 $ exist in nature.

5|$|Volcanic gas {{includes}} {{a variety of}} substances. These include gases trapped in cavities (vesicles) in volcanic rocks, dissolved or dissociated gases in magma and lava, or gases emanating directly from lava or indirectly through ground water heated by volcanic action. The volcanic gases that pose the greatest potential hazard to people, animals, agriculture, and property are sulfur <b>dioxide,</b> carbon <b>dioxide</b> and hydrogen fluoride. Locally, sulfur <b>dioxide</b> gas can lead to acid rain and air pollution downwind from the volcano. Globally, large explosive eruptions that inject a tremendous volume of sulfur aerosols into the stratosphere can lead to lower surface temperatures and promote weakening of the Earth's ozone layer. Because carbon <b>dioxide</b> gas is heavier than air, the gas may flow into low-lying areas and collect in the soil. The concentration of carbon <b>dioxide</b> gas in these areas can be lethal to people, animals, and vegetation.|$|E

40|$|Lithium-rich layered {{electrode}} {{materials are}} of interest as a promising candidate of cathodes for lithiumion batteries because of their excellent electrochemical properties. The electrochemical performance of these materials is mainly regulated by preparation conditions during synthesis and calcination process. Here, microspherical Li 1. 2 Mn 0. 54 Co 0. 13 Ni 0. 13 O 2 (LMNCO) particles are synthesized through steady pH value control with carbon <b>dioxides</b> bubbling method in co-precipitation process using a simple reactor. SEM images present that CP-LMNCO sample prepared through the assistance of carbon <b>dioxides</b> has spherical particle morphology, while sample (TP-LMNCO) without carbon <b>dioxides</b> assistance shows large nanoparticles agglomeration. The CP-LMNCO electrode demonstrates superior electrochemical performance, which exhibits capacity retention of 97. 76 % after 100 cycles compared with only 81. 94 % for TP-LMNCO electrode at 1 C (250 mAg(- 1)). Even at a higher current density (5 C), the CP-LMNCO electrode shows reversible capacity up to 105. 4 mA h g(- 1). The remarkably improved electrochemical performance of CP-LMNCO electrode is ascribed to spherical morphology with small surface area which decreases side reactions with electrolyte during cycling and smaller primary sizes which reduce lithium ion (Li+) diffusion distance. Furthermore, the synthesis of spherical materials using metal sulfate with high concentration (up to 5 M) as starting agents are attempted under carbon <b>dioxides</b> assisted conditions, and as-prepared materials also show improved performance.
