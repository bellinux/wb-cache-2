500|$|Simonsohn urged {{researchers}} to look hard for confounding variables in field data analysis. An {{example of a}} confounding variable is baby-name popularity. This has fluctuated significantly over the decades. Simonsohn found that although Walter and Dennis are of near-identical popularity in a large sample of US first names of living people, Walter is a relatively old-fashioned name. He suggested that when Pelham et al. found a disproportionately high number of dentists whose name started with the letters [...] "Den" [...] compared to with [...] "Wal", they had overlooked that people named Walter would tend to be old, {{and more likely to}} be retired. Baby-name fluctuation seemed a better explanation for disproportionately more [...] "Den" [...] dentists than [...] "Wal" [...] than implicit egotism.Using both a different data set (TwitterandGoogle+accounts) and a different statistical analysis, Kooti, Magno, and Weber found no evidence of people disproportionately having a <b>job</b> <b>matching</b> their name initials.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} training investments in two-tier labor markets, {{focusing on the}} role of <b>job</b> <b>match</b> quality. Temporary workers are in general more likely than permanent workers to leave their employer and therefore are less likely to receive employer-funded training. However, as firms prefer to continue productive <b>job</b> <b>matches,</b> we hypothesize that the negative effect of holding a temporary contract on the probability to be trained diminishes with the quality of the <b>job</b> <b>match.</b> Using a recent longitudinal survey from the Netherlands, we find that temporary workers indeed participate less frequently in firm-sponsored training. However, this effect is fully driven by mismatches: holding a temporary contract does not significantly decrease the probability to receive training for workers in good <b>job</b> <b>matches.</b> Depending on match quality, a temporary job can either be a stepping stone or a dead-end...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{empirical}} {{evidence for the}} US economy suggests that <b>job</b> <b>matches</b> created during economic expansions {{turn out to be}} of better quality than <b>job</b> <b>matches</b> created during economic recessions. We discuss different measures of job mismatching for the Spanish labour market: (i) measures based on the degree of adjustment between job requirements and workers’ qualifications; and (ii) measures based on the duration of the <b>job</b> <b>match</b> (Jovanovic, 1979). Given our data limitations and the duality of the Spanish labour market we follow the second approach and define a good <b>job</b> <b>match</b> as a temporary contract that is converted into a permanent one. We find, as expected, that temporary matches created during periods of economic recession {{are less likely to be}} converted into permanent contracts than temporary matches created in periods of economic expansion. However, contrary to other available empirical findings for the US, this cyclical pattern of <b>job</b> <b>match</b> quality in the Spanish labour market appears to be due to a “stop-gap” job phenomenon: during recessions unemployed Spanish workers are more willing to accept jobs that require lower skills while they wait better opportunities when the business cycle recovers. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} returns to {{seniority}}, the returns to experience, {{and the effects}} of seniority and experience at the time of a quit or layoff on changes in the <b>job</b> <b>match</b> specific component of wages. We show that these returns are not identified in widely used regression models that relate the wage changes of stayers, quits, and layoffs to tenure and experience. We deal with the identification of problems in two ways. First, we obtain theoretical bounds on key unidentified parameters using a simple model of wages and mobility. Second, we check the implications of assumptions about the linear tenure slope for the estimates of the returns to tenure, experience, and the effect of tenure on <b>job</b> <b>match</b> gains. We have three main empirical findings. First, there is a large return to general labor market experience that is independent of job shopping. Second, the return to tenure is probably above the Altonji and Shakotko's (1987) estimate but far below OLS estimates. Third, quits results in substantial <b>job</b> <b>match</b> gains for inexperienced workers. Layoffs are associated with the substantial <b>job</b> <b>match</b> losses for workers who have been on the job for over a year. ...|$|R

30|$|In {{contrast}} to these theoretical explanations concerning unemployment scarring, there exist assumptions about potentially {{positive effects of}} early unemployment. Following e.g. Kahn and Low ([1982]) {{it is argued that}} off-the-job searches (searching for jobs while economically inactive), may be more efficient, resulting in better <b>job</b> <b>matches</b> that go together with higher re-employment wages and good career prospects. According to this theoretical perspective, early episodes of economic inactivity and career-adjustment may be regarded as prolonged matching processes leading to better <b>job</b> <b>matches</b> in the longer run. In this sense, periods of early economic inactivity are not necessarily damaging with regard to future occupational outcomes.|$|R
