500|$|Before {{his arrival}} on screen, Barber {{described}} Rhys as being determined and focused, while Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy said his arrival {{would cause a}} stir. Rhys is ambitious, persuasive and manipulative. His profile on the official Neighbours website states that he believes Erinsborough is [...] "a bit of a backwater", while he {{is more of a}} city guy. Rhys is an enthusiastic young doctor and often riles his colleague, Karl, in his quest to become a surgeon. He wants to succeed and can justify why he does certain things, which hurt other people. Rhys is good at separating his work life from his home life and he knows <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good time. Barber revealed that Rhys does have a sensitive side and he can mean well.|$|E

500|$|Paper Trail {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} most music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 74, based on 19 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Several critics praised the production on the album; Andy Kellman of AllMusic noted that DJ Toomp's and Danja's production appearance provided [...] "some much needed punch", which placed the album above T.I.'s previous album, T.I. vs. T.I.P.. Margeaux Watson of Entertainment Weekly {{said that the}} [...] "outstanding production" [...] proved that T.I. [...] "still knows <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good time". Wilson McBee of Slant Magazine called the songs produced by Toomp the [...] "vintage T.I.", describing the sound as [...] "ecstasies of sweltering synth lines, ground-shaking 808 patterns and breathless verbalizing". However, McBee felt that the songs that were directly about T.I.'s prison sentence for weapons charges ("No Matter What", [...] "Ready for Whatever") were among the weakest on the album, saying that [...] "admitting guilt, making excuses and expressing no regrets falls flat". Sharing a similar sentiment, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone called the songs [...] "mostly dispenses with the Tupac-wannabe gangsta-confessor pretensions to deliver catchy, tight, bombastic pop-rap alongside a who's-who of megastar guests", saying that T.I. was a [...] "well-oiled hit machine who's more fun than deep".|$|E

However, the filmmaker's efforts were never fully realized because the fairy tale was considered too [...] "small". In 2008, co-directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard decided to enlarge the film's scale in order to transform it into a [...] "big event" [...] in order {{for it to be}} successful. Meanwhile, the character Mother Gothel was developed into a much more complex villain than the witch upon whom she is based, conceiving her as [...] "a very lonely woman who really did not know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> relationship of any kind". Little else had been determined about the character at the time, who was simply described as [...] "the type of woman who ... envisioned herself in the spotlight." [...] A departure from traditional Disney villains, Mother Gothel is not a witch or a sorceress. Because she lacks supernatural powers, the character is forced to rely solely on her wit, charm, intellect and charisma, a conscious decision made by Greno and Howard. However, in the Brothers Grimm's original fairy tale, Gothel is very much depicted as a typical witch-like character, an idea that was modified for the Disney film adaptation in favor of having Gothel's agelessness instead be [...] "derive ... from Rapunzel's hair." ...|$|E

50|$|After retirement, Stewart spent {{a period}} of time {{coaching}} the Port Colborne Sailors, where he encountered a young Ted Kennedy in 1942-43. As was the case with Stewart, Kennedy was not a particularly fast skater, but like Stewart he also possessed fine balance and stickhandling ability. Stewart confided in his young trainee that to compensate for his lack of speed, he would need to become an expert playmaker, learning <b>how</b> <b>to</b> work from the corners. He drilled Kennedy prodigiously in passing, as well as <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> effective net-front presence.

500|$|Shortly {{after his}} casting was announced, Barber told a {{reporter}} for the Herald Sun that he loved his character and said his determination and focus would get him into trouble. Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy said Rhys's arrival would cause a stir in Erinsborough and may not go down well with some of the local residents. Barber also called Rhys ambitious and said that while he is not a villain, he is not an entirely good guy either. The actor explained [...] "He rides that line and that's {{a lot of fun to}} play. There are a lot of different dynamics. He can be very persuasive, bordering on manipulative, but he has a sensitive side as well, which is coming out gradually." [...] Barber told a writer for Inside Soap that Rhys is good at separating his work life from his home life, and can easily switch from one to the other. Barber quipped that Rhys knows <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good time, while the official Neighbours website said he considers himself [...] "a bit of a ladies' man". A Herald Sun reporter said Rhys would [...] "rile" [...] his colleague, Karl Kennedy. Alan Fletcher, who plays Karl, revealed that his character and Rhys would share many scenes. Fletcher explained that it can be [...] "somewhat galling" [...] for Karl to be faced with Rhys, who is an enthusiastic young doctor. The actor added [...] "So expect some fun confrontation but also cleverly the writers have explored what Rhys and Karl might have in common." ...|$|E

This study presents strategies on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> advantage over competitors as to business survival. The financial situation of the performing arts organizations in the United States is also affected by <b>how</b> consumers decide <b>to</b> spend their leisure time. People, who have no free time because of their day to day activities, are most likely to spend their scarce leisure time with the children, family, or friends. Surveys have revealed that many people are interested in attending the performing arts but they do not actually attend any arts events for various reasons. The major reason for this disparity between interest and attendance is lack of accessibility and/or resources: time; money (ticket prices); ticket availability equal to customer satisfaction; and audience convenience and etiquette. In conclusion, performing arts organizations need to understand their audience 2 ̆ 7 s needs and concerns thru marketing research to effectively incorporate entertainment into their programming and continue to be profitable business...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWith the {{evolution}} of technology, the ways to acquire data and the applications of data are more diverse. As data volume con- tinuously grows, the data quality may not be high as usual. The data can be defected, imprecise or inaccurate due {{to the process of}} data acquiring. Recently, the skyline query is widely used in data analysis to derive the results that meets more than one spe- cific condition simultaneously. For example, the forest monitoring system, which collects the temperature and humidity of the surrounding environment with sensors, to monitor the disasters. Using the skyline query, the zones of potential fire hazards can be found in time, where the temperature is high and the humidity is low. In the mentioned application, the derived data change with time. We refer to such data as data streams. The constant change and uncertainty of data make the query process difficult and need more computations. Thus, <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> effective skyline query process in terms of time and space over uncertain data streams becomes crucial. In this paper, we discuss this problem and propose an effective approach, Efficient Probabilistic Skyline Update (EPSU), using a new data structure by augmenting the R-tree structure. The relevant algorithms are analyzed and discussed. Last, we perform the simulated experiments extensively with synthetic data to validate the EPSU approach. The results show that EPSU can effectively compute the probabilistic skyline query in terms of the time and space and outperforms the existing ones...|$|R
