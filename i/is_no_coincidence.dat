5|$|Atlantic puffins are {{probably}} safest when out at sea. Here, the dangers are often from below the water rather than above, and puffins {{can sometimes be}} seen putting their heads underwater to peer around for predators. Seals {{have been known to}} kill puffins and large fish may also do so. Most puffin colonies are on small islands, and this <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> as it avoids predation by ground-based mammals such as foxes, rats, stoats and weasels, cats and dogs. When they come ashore, the birds are still at risk and the main threats come from the sky.|$|E
25|$|The {{timing of}} the West Country Carnival close to the British celebration of Bonfire night on 5 November <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence,</b> as {{the roots of the}} {{original}} carnival in Bridgwater date back to 1605.|$|E
25|$|Radiocarbon dating {{traces the}} {{disappearance}} of ground sloths in the United States to around 11,000 years ago. Steadman et al. argue that it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that {{studies have shown that}} {{the disappearance of}} ground sloths occur a few years after humans inhabited their living areas, however, recent scientific work is beginning to reveal that climate change had much more of an impact on the decline of the mega fauna in North America.|$|E

50|$|In the Sandman graphic novel Endless Nights, {{there is}} a story with Rao as the {{personification}} of the Kryptonian sun. The story hints that the Kryptonian race and Kal-El's survival <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence,</b> but a making of Rao.|$|R
50|$|Manson {{murder victims}} Leno and Rosemary LaBianca's home was beside where {{a long time}} close friend of Kaufman had rented a house, Manson had {{attended}} parties there with Kaufman when still friendly with him. Kaufman has always said this <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence.</b>|$|R
25|$|Deepak's {{works are}} characterised by their tragic, dark endings. His {{characters}} find {{death as a}} constant companion, and often succumb to it. Often, critics have suggested that Deepak walks alongside his characters with a loaded gun—recoiled and ready to fire. Maybe, one can trace the beginnings of Deepak's present mental ordeal to the dark stories that he was writing even in the early 1970s. Perhaps, it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that Deepak's favourite authors are Sylvia Plath and Virginia Woolf, who succumbed to mental agony themselves.|$|E
25|$|Furman {{may have}} been the most {{successful}} coach in the history of chess, although some would give that title to Mark Dvoretsky. Chess culture has traditionally and typically credited the player for chess success, with the coach recognized in a much lesser fashion, or not at all. Chess coaches were not commonly seen for top players until the post-World War II period, when competition became much stiffer. They were first developed in the Soviet Union and in other Eastern European countries; it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that top players from these nations have dominated chess for the past sixty years. Furman, with a very significant role in Karpov's development from his late teens, building upon earlier roles with World Champion Botvinnik and world-class players such as Bronstein, Korchnoi, and Geller, may have done more than any other coach, from the early 1950s until the late 1970s, to help ensure Soviet dominance.|$|E
500|$|Promoting saints was {{something}} Jocelin would repeat at Glasgow, where he [...] "transferred his enthusiasm to St Kentigern" [...] and commissioned a hagiography of that saint, the saint most venerated by the Celts {{of the diocese}} of Glasgow. It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that Jocelin of Furness, {{the man who wrote}} the Life of St. Waltheof, was the same man later commissioned to write the Life of St. Kentigern.|$|E
50|$|Some bookbinders {{believe that}} Wayzgoose {{was held on}} St Bartholomew's Day {{because he was the}} patron saint of leather workers. It <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that on August 24, 1456 the {{printing}} of the Gutenberg Bible was completed, perhaps triggering the very first wayzgoose party at Fust-Schöffer shop in Mainz.|$|R
5000|$|In the fourth-season finale, [...] "Chuck Versus the Cliffhanger", Volkoff's {{personality}} is restored {{to that of}} Hartley Winterbottom. At {{the end of the}} episode, Clyde Decker reveals that it <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that Chuck received the Intersect and had to face Fulcrum, the Ring, Daniel Shaw, and Agent X.|$|R
50|$|The {{timing of}} Georgia State's move <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence.</b> The CAA <b>was</b> set {{to vote on}} April 10 to {{increase}} its exit fee from $250,000 to at least $1 million.

500|$|During 1893, {{the company}} {{considered}} adding a third tank, which would add another 60 pots of capacity. The expansion cost estimate was $150,000 (over $3.8 million in 2012 dollars), and {{was said to}} [...] "give employment to 350 men." [...] Two major concerns voiced by management to community leaders were adequate fire protection and housing for the workers. [...] Community leaders did not respond soon enough, and the expansion was postponed. [...] However, it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that Hartford City's waterworks began operations in 1894, and the plant {{was built on the}} city's south side. [...] The city also acquired a chemical fire engine from the Chicago Fire Extinguisher Company, which was delivered in February 1894.|$|E
500|$|The {{influence}} of several contemporary bands was deemed apparent upon {{the sound of}} the album. Robin Jahdi writes that [...] "the Isis sound, debuted proper on the 2002 album, is still present and correct, but there's more subtle shifts in mood here, most interestingly when they take influence from outside (Tool's Adam Jones plays on two songs). The basslines bounce and jolt with that familiar elasticity, but the seismic six-string shifts on songs like 'Hand of the Host' and '20 Minutes / 40 Years' are the sort not heard from this band in years. It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that these are highlights." [...] The rhythms of [...] "20 Minutes / 40 Years" [...] are described as [...] "Pelican-like" [...] by NME reviewer Ben Patashnik, and No Ripcords Sean Caldwell compares the album to Mastodon's Blood Mountain, citing its potential for [...] "crossover" [...] appeal.|$|E
500|$|Æthelstan's {{court was}} {{the centre of}} {{a revival of the}} {{elaborate}} hermeneutic style of later Latin writers, influenced by the West Saxon scholar Aldhelm (c.639–709), and by early tenth-century French monasticism. Foreign scholars at Æthelstan's court such as Israel the Grammarian were practitioners. The style was characterised by long, convoluted sentences and a predilection for rare words and neologisms. The [...] "Æthelstan A" [...] charters were written in hermeneutic Latin. In the view of Simon Keynes it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that they first appear immediately after the king had for the first time united England under his rule, and they show a high level of intellectual attainment and a monarchy invigorated by success and adopting the trappings of a new political order. The style influenced architects of the late tenth-century monastic reformers educated at Æthelstan's court such as Æthelwold and Dunstan, and became a hallmark of the movement. After [...] "Æthelstan A", charters became more simple, but the hermeneutic style returned in the charters of Eadwig and Edgar.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} argued that the Penny Post's launch at the period of the {{exclusion}} crisis <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence.</b> It <b>was</b> announced on 22 March 1679 in the Mercurius Civicus, a Whig paper. It has been claimed that the opposition leader Lord Shaftesbury was a backer of the scheme, as he was of the paper.|$|R
50|$|Thus, it <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that Republican {{propaganda}} had, by {{its initial}} mark, {{the publication of}} the Republican Manifesto in 1870 (the year in which the Paraguayan War ended), followed by the Itu Convention in 1873 and the emergence of Republican clubs, which Have multiplied, since then, by the main centers in the country.|$|R
500|$|The Byzantines {{followed}} this {{up with the}} destruction of the North African flotillas, and coupled their successes at sea with severe trading limitations imposed on Muslim traders. Given the Empire's new ability to control the waterways, this strangled Muslim maritime trade. With the collapse of the Umayyad state shortly thereafter and the increasing fragmentation of the Muslim world, the Byzantine navy was left as the sole organized naval force in the Mediterranean. Thus, during {{the latter half of the}} 8th century, the Byzantines enjoyed a second period of complete naval superiority. It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that in the many Islamic apocalyptic texts composed and transmitted during the first and second Islamic centuries, the End Times are preceded by a seaborne Byzantine invasion. Many traditions from the period stress that manning the guard posts (ribāṭ) on the coasts of Syria is tantamount to partaking in the jihād, and authorities like Abu Hurayrah were cited as considering one day of ribāṭ more pious an act than a night of prayer in the Kaaba.|$|E
500|$|Other {{examples}} of the work as a parody can be taken from {{the names of the}} Scriptores themselves. It has been suggested that [...] "Trebellius Pollio" [...] and [...] "Flavius Vopiscus Syracusius" [...] were invented, with one theory arguing that their origins are based on passages in Cicero's letters and speeches in the 1st century BC. With respect to [...] "Trebellius Pollio", this is a reference to Lucius Trebellius, a supporter of Mark Antony who was mentioned in the Philippics (Phil, 11.14), and another reference to him in Epistulae ad Familiares along with the term [...] "Pollentiam" [...] reminded the History's author of Asinius Pollio, who was a fellow Plebeian Tribune alongside Lucius Trebellius and a historian as well. This is reinforced by noted similarities between the fictitious criticism of [...] "Trebellius Pollio" [...] by [...] "Flavius Vopiscus" [...] {{at the start of the}} Life of Aurelian, with similar comments made by Asinius Pollio about Julius Caesar's published Commentaries. Significantly, Lucius Trebellius adopted the Cognomen Fides for his actions as Plebeian Tribune in 47 BC to resist laws that would abolish debts; later when he fell into debt himself and began supporting debt abolishment, Cicero used his cognomen as a method of abuse and ridicule. According to this theory it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that, in selecting the name [...] "Trebellius Pollio", the author is playing with the concepts of fides and fidelitas historica at the precise point in the lives that are assigned to [...] "Trebellius Pollio" [...] and [...] "Flavius Vopiscus Syracusius".|$|E

25|$|They would dine {{early on}} first Thursdays at a hotel, {{planning}} what to do; {{high on the}} agenda was {{to change the way}} the Royal Society Council did business.

50|$|Between 1994 and 1997 Naomh Brid {{qualified}} for four under 12-football titles.

In 1994, Naomh Brid qualified to play Dungarvan in the final at Cappoquin but the final was never played.|$|R
2500|$|For {{this new}} countercultural movement, {{information}} was a precious commodity. In the ’60s, {{there was no}} Internet; no 500 cable channels. [...] was {{a great example of}} user-generated content, without advertising, before the Internet. Basically, Brand invented the blogosphere long before there was any such thing as a blog. [...] No topic was too esoteric, no degree of enthusiasm too ardent, no amateur expertise too uncertified to be included. [...] This I am sure about: it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that the Whole Earth Catalogs disappeared as soon as the web and blogs arrived. Everything the Whole Earth Catalogs did, the web does better.|$|E
2500|$|Alexandria was {{not only}} a center of Hellenism, but was also home to the largest urban Jewish {{community}} in the world. The Septuagint, a Greek version of the Tanakh, was produced there. The early Ptolemies kept it in order and fostered the development of its museum into the leading Hellenistic center of learning (Library of Alexandria), but were careful to maintain the distinction of its population's three largest ethnicities: Greek, Jewish, and Egyptian. A reading of Alexandrian poetry might easily give the impression that Egyptians did not exist at all; indeed Egypt itself is hardly mentioned except for the Nile and the Nile flood, [...] This omission of the Egypt and Egyptians from poetry masks a fundamental insecurity. It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that one of the few poetic references to Egyptians presents them as muggers.}} ...|$|E
2500|$|About {{the same}} time, Vladimir Ryzhkov {{pointed out that}} a bill Medvedev had sent to the State Duma in late January 2009, when signed into law, will allow Kremlin-friendly {{regional}} legislatures to remove opposition mayors who were elected by popular vote: [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that Medvedev has taken aim at the country's mayors. Mayoral elections were the last bastion of direct elections after the Duma cancelled the popular vote for governors in 2005. Independent mayors were {{the only source of}} political competition against governors who were loyal to the Kremlin and United Russia. Now {{one of the few remaining}} checks and balances against the monopoly on executive power in the regions will be removed.

5000|$|In her opinion, {{the line}} of [...] "anti-Semitic descent" [...] from Martin Luther to Adolf Hitler was [...] "easy to draw". She wrote that Hitler and Luther were both obsessed by the [...] "demonologized universe" [...] {{inhabited}} by Jews, and that the similarities between Luther's anti-Jewish writings and modern anti-Semitism <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence,</b> because they derived from a common history of Judenhass.|$|R

2500|$|The Royal Zoological Society of Dublin was {{established}} {{at a meeting}} held at the Rotunda Hospital on 10 May 1830 [...] and the zoo, then called the Zoological Gardens Dublin, was {{opened to the public}} on 1 September 1831. The animals, 46 mammals and 72 birds, were donated by London Zoo. It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that the founders of Dublin Zoo were members of the medical profession. Their interest was in studying the animals while they were alive and more particularly getting hold of them when they were dead. In the 1830s the laws concerning cadavers for medical use changed. Up until then, anyone not associated with one of the big medical institutions had to resort to grave-robbing in order to obtain a cadaver for study, so getting hold of the corpse of a primate without having to rob a grave was considered quite a coup.|$|E
2500|$|It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. {{was founded}} in the year 1913. That year was a pivotal year for issues {{regarding}} race and equality in the United States. In January of that year, African-Americans celebrated the 50 year anniversary of {{the signing of the}} Emancipation Proclamation. And in February of the same year, Rosa McCauley (later Rosa Parks) the [...] "Mother of the Civil rights movement" [...] was born in Tuskegee, Alabama. In March 1913, the Women's suffrage march occurred, and the United States lost one of the most prolific freedom fighters the country has [...] ever seen, when Harriet Tubman died in New York. In May, Samuel Owensby, a Black man in Hogansville, Georgia was lynched near the local jail, after which his body was riddled with bullets. The nation's justice system condoned lynching in both southern and northern parts of the country. This violence was so entrenched in the United States that one report called the record of lynchings that year a [...] "small number" [...] based on a 13% decrease from the year prior.|$|E
2500|$|Ronnie {{is in her}} thirties, and {{the elder}} of the two sisters. Prior to her début, Womack {{described}} Ronnie as the more sensible and intelligent sister, stating {{that she has a}} [...] "caustic tongue" [...] and trust issues. She commented that the sisters are loyal to each other to the point that Ronnie would kill for Roxy, and attributed her [...] "darker side" [...] to her troubled childhood. A BBC source described Ronnie as the ice to Roxy's fire, and Simons deemed her [...] "armoured", as well as the [...] "less flamboyant, darker" [...] sister, with a more controlling nature. Womack feels that Ronnie is [...] "deeply damaged", describing her as unable to be honest with herself or others {{as a result of her}} guarded personality. She explained that she has been taught to hide her feelings and to be a survivor, which she accomplishes by controlling others, concluding that Ronnie is defined by her childhood trauma. The sisters have been compared to the Kray twins, Ronnie and Reggie. Womack has noted that it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> that the siblings are named Ronnie and Roxy. She describes them as [...] "co-dependent and dysfunctional", as well as [...] "chilling, dark and absolutely in touch with what the other is doing". Treadwell-Collins initially intended for Ronnie to appear enigmatic, cool and guarded, hoping to intrigue viewers before introducing elements of her backstory to garner audience sympathy.|$|E
30|$|Vaginal approach, {{endoscopic}} access (Fig.  6 —endoscopic colposuspension) {{and breast}} conservation: all these developments <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence</b> {{but the result}} of a profound respect for our patients.

Not surprisingly, endoscopy is part of most, if not all, of these new treatment strategies.|$|R
2500|$|According to the History of Ming, {{completed}} in 1739, the treasure ships were 44 zhang, 4 chi, i.e. 444 chi in length, {{and had a}} beam of 18 zhang. The dimensions of ships <b>are</b> <b>no</b> <b>coincidence.</b> The number [...] "4" [...] has numerological significance {{as a symbol of}} the 4 cardinal directions, 4 seasons, and 4 virtues. The number 4 was an auspicious association for treasure ships.|$|R
