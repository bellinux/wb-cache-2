50|$|Fish: <b>Dinoseb</b> is {{also highly}} toxic for fish, because fish {{are able to}} take up <b>dinoseb</b> very quickly. For small fish like {{goldfish}} only 0,4 ppm is needed to kill all fish in the water. When a fish lives in an acidic water environment <b>dinoseb</b> is more toxic than when a fish lives in a neutral or alkaline water environment. This is because <b>dinoseb</b> is slightly acidic.|$|E
50|$|Rats: <b>Dinoseb</b> causes acute {{toxicity}} in rats after a single dose after circa fourteen days. About 50% of the rats die {{when they are}} given 25-28 mg/kg <b>dinoseb</b> orally. Much more is needed when the rats are exposed to <b>dinoseb</b> via the skin. In this case 50% dies when the rats are exposed to 80 mg/kg. When the <b>dinoseb</b> is injected a dose of 20 mg/kg will cause death of 50% of the rats. But also for rats turned out <b>dinoseb</b> was capable {{to go through the}} placenta and therefore causes embryotoxic and teratogenic effects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dinoseb</b> {{can cross}} {{biological}} membranes like the blood-brain barrier and the placental barrier. This explains why <b>dinoseb</b> is particularly dangerous for pregnant women. If the compound can pass the placental barrier, the unborn {{child will be}} exposed to <b>dinoseb</b> via {{the blood of the}} mother.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dinoseb</b> is an {{herbicide}} in the dinitrophenol family. The IUPAC name is 2-(butan-2-yl)-4,6-dinitrophenol and its {{molecular formula}} is C10H12N2O5. Naturally, <b>dinoseb</b> occurs as orange crystals which cannot dissolve in water easily. <b>Dinoseb</b> is banned as an herbicide in the EU and USA {{because of its}} toxicity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dinoseb</b> is an {{herbicide}} {{that was}} once widely used for weed-control when producing crops like soybeans, vegetables, fruits and nuts, or citrus. In the present, <b>dinoseb</b> is banned in the EU and USA due to its high toxicity. However, <b>dinoseb</b> is still used in China for example; evidenced {{by the fact that}} it is found in rain- and drinking water. Nowadays there are other, safer herbicides that can be used. <b>Dinoseb</b> was also used as an insecticide to protect grapes. On the internet, <b>dinoseb</b> and other dinitrophenols are bought as weight-loss pills. It is very dangerous however, and many people have died of accidental overdose.|$|E
5000|$|Binapacryl is an {{miticide}} and fungicide. [...] Chemically, {{it is an}} ester {{derivative of}} <b>dinoseb.</b> Although binapacryl has low toxicity itself, it is readily metabolized to form <b>dinoseb,</b> which is toxic.|$|E
50|$|Birds: It {{was found}} that <b>dinoseb</b> was also highly toxic to birds. When birds are given a single dose between 7-9 mg/kg around 50% of the birds dies. The most birds are exposed to <b>dinoseb</b> via the small streams of water.|$|E
50|$|In 1892, dinitro-ortho-cresol (2,4-dinitro-6-methylphenol), a {{chemical}} compound {{closely related to}} <b>dinoseb,</b> was discovered in Germany and first used as an insecticide. It was later also used as an herbicide and also fungicide characteristics were discovered. In 1945 the ortho-methyl group {{was replaced by a}} sec-butyl group, producing <b>dinoseb.</b> This compound had a superior contact and stomach activity on insects and mites. <b>Dinoseb</b> became commercially available in 1945 and was approved for use in the United States based on safety data from Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories. On January 13, 1984 the Danish ship Dana Optima lost 80 drums of <b>Dinoseb</b> during their trip from North Shields (UK) to Esbjerg (DK). After four months 72 drums were found and recovered. <b>Dinoseb</b> was withdrawn from the market in 1986 due to an increased threat of birth defects after female field workers were exposed to the chemical. It could also cause sterility in men who were exposed to the chemical.|$|E
50|$|Three {{hours after}} oral or {{intraperitoneal}} administration, the 14C in the kidneys and liver {{of the mother}} was about 50% <b>dinoseb</b> and 50% metabolites. However, the 14C in the kidneys and liver of the embryo was 85% <b>dinoseb</b> after oral administration and 57% after intraperitoneal administration.|$|E
50|$|The {{product of}} this {{reaction}} can undergo a second nitration to form <b>dinoseb.</b>|$|E
50|$|After oral {{administration}} of <b>dinoseb</b> tagged with 14C to rats and mice, {{it turned out}} that 40 to 65% of the 14C was excreted in the urine and 30 to 40% ended up in the feces. TLC data showed the presence of different metabolites of <b>dinoseb,</b> although these were not identified. This finding was confirmed by different in vitro and in vivo studies.|$|E
50|$|Research {{has also}} shown that <b>dinoseb</b> is {{carcinogenic}} for female mice, but not for male mice.|$|E
5000|$|Nowadays <b>dinoseb</b> {{is banned}} {{in a lot}} of places in the world due to high incidences of birth defects. Because of this ban not a lot of people are exposed to <b>dinoseb</b> anymore. But when someone is exposed, a few things can be done as first aid. The victim can be exposed via four ways: inhalation, skin, eyes, ingestion. These are the first aid {{measures}} for the four ways of exposure: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Dinoseb</b> is {{not only}} a toxic {{compound}} for human but also for animals such as rats, fish and birds.|$|E
50|$|By {{lowering}} the proton gradient, <b>dinoseb</b> removes the cell’s {{ability to produce}} ATP, resulting {{in the death of}} the cell.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dinoseb</b> is an {{uncoupler}} of oxidative phosphorylation. It is a {{weak acid}} that can pass through lipid membranes when it’s in the undissociated form.|$|E
50|$|Oral LD50 {{values of}} <b>dinoseb</b> range from 14 to 114 mg/kg in rats, mice rabbits and guinea pigs. For humans, this is 5-50 mg/kg.|$|E
50|$|The {{second step}} in the {{synthesis}} of <b>dinoseb</b> is the nitration of 2-(1-methylpropyl)phenol. First, the nitronium ion is formed from nitric acid and sulfuric acid.|$|E
50|$|Exposure to <b>dinoseb</b> also induces ER-mediated calcium release, {{resulting}} in increased intracellular calcium levels. This {{is followed by}} activation of caspase, which is a protease involved in cell apoptosis. The surviving cells have an increase of alpha-synuclein levels which leads to dopaminergic neurodegeneration.|$|E
5000|$|Commercial DNP {{is used as}} an {{antiseptic}} and as a non-selective bioaccumulating pesticide. [...] It is {{a chemical}} intermediate {{in the production of}} sulfur dyes, wood preservatives, and some herbicides including <b>dinoseb</b> and dinoterb. DNP has also been used to make photographic developers and explosives.|$|E
50|$|The {{first step}} in the {{synthesis}} of <b>dinoseb</b> is the synthesis of 2-(1-methylpropyl)phenol from 1-butene and phenol. First, 1-butene is protonated so that a secondary carbocation is formed. This can only happen under acidic conditions. The formed carbocation can undergo electrophilic aromatic substitution with phenol. The product of this reaction is 2-(1-methylpropyl)phenol.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dinoseb</b> {{is highly}} toxic when ingesting, inhaling or at skin contact. Symptoms include fatigue, sweating, headaches, nausea, stomach aches and fever. It {{is also an}} {{irritant}} for the eyes. Skin contact causes burns and it turns yellow. For pregnant women this substance is especially dangerous as it can cause growth defects in unborn children (it is teratogenic).|$|E
50|$|In plants, <b>dinoseb</b> also {{inhibits}} photosynthesis by inhibiting {{the electron}} flow from photocomplex II to plastoquinone. As a result, the plastoquinone can’t create a proton gradient and no ATP {{is produced by}} the ATP synthase. Also, NADP can’t be reduced to form NADPH, which removes {{the ability to create}} glucose from carbondioxide. This also leads to cell death.|$|E
50|$|It {{uses this}} {{property}} to transport protons through the inner mitochondrial membrane(IMM). Protons are taken {{up from the}} intermembrane space and after transport through the IMM, they are released again in the mitochondrial matrix. <b>Dinoseb</b> in the dissociated form is negatively charged, which causes it {{to move to the}} intermembrane space because of the electrochemical gradient that exists across the IMM.|$|E
50|$|Dantrolene sodium is a postsynaptic {{muscle relaxant}} that lessens excitation-contraction {{coupling}} in muscle cells. It achieves this by inhibiting Ca2+ ions release from sarcoplasmic reticulum stores by antagonizing ryanodine receptors. It {{is the primary}} drug used for the treatment and prevention of malignant hyperthermia, a rare, life-threatening disorder triggered by general anesthesia. It is also used {{in the management of}} neuroleptic malignant syndrome, muscle spasticity (e.g. after strokes, in paraplegia, cerebral palsy, or patients with multiple sclerosis), and 2,4-dinitrophenol poisoning, and the related compounds <b>dinoseb</b> and dinoterb.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dinoseb</b> {{interferes with}} the {{oxidative}} phosphorylation by acting as an uncoupler, which is the production of ATP in the mitochondria. This is done by making the inner membrane of the mitochondria more permeable to protons. The protons can return to the mitochondrial matrix more easily, which results in a lower difference in proton concentration {{on either side of}} the inner mitochondrial membrane. In other words: The proton gradient is lower, so the membrane potential will be lower. As the membrane potential is the driving force for the production of ATP, the cell is unable to produce energy.|$|E
5000|$|In April, 1980 the Regina Leader-Post {{obtained}} {{and published}} a Canadian government list {{of more than}} 97 chemicals tested by IBT for which studies were considered [...] "suspect". In June, 1980 an additional nine chemicals were added. According to Fagin and Lavelle in Toxic Deception, Wright tampered with safety data for Machete and monosodium cyanurate, both Monsanto products. IBT performed safety tests on <b>Dinoseb,</b> which was later discovered to cause birth defects and then pulled from the U.S. market in 1986. IBT also originally evaluated the safety of atrazine, a herbicide now thought to be an endocrine disruptor, suspected carcinogen, and possible teratogen.|$|E
50|$|Twenty {{different}} pesticides {{were detected}} in on-site soil surface samples including diazinon, endosulfan and heptachlor epoxide, which {{were found at}} highest levels in the burn area, and disulfoton, endosulfan, merphos, and methamidophos which were found in high concentrations near the former warehouse and office. The concentrations of listed pesticides were all significantly above comparison values and therefore of concern for human and environmental health. On-site groundwater was reported to contain low levels of butyric acid, <b>dinoseb,</b> and endosulfan due to leaching. Only endosulfan concentrations were significantly above comparison values. On-site air analyses also found eight different pesticides at levels significantly above background levels. The eight pesticides were dacthal, diainon, endosulfan, malathion, mevinphos, maled, methyl parathion, and phorate. However, these concentrations were not enough in comparison to raise concern. Lastly, dead fish samples found in the pond contained dacthal (27.3 mg/kg), DDE (0.11 mg/kg), diazinon (0.1 mg/kg), and endosulfan (0.92 mg/kg).|$|E
40|$|A novel soil {{treatment}} method for achieving {{the removal of}} <b>dinoseb</b> (2 -sec-butyl- 4, 6 -dinitrophenol) from contaminated soils was investigated. One soil contained <b>dinoseb</b> as the major contaminant, although several other hazardous compounds were also present. A second soil was highly contaminated with <b>dinoseb.</b> <b>Dinoseb</b> was not degraded in these soils under the aerobic conditions at each site. Pretreatment of the soils {{by the addition of}} a starchy potato-processing by-product and flooding with phosphate buffer stimulated the consumption of oxygen and nitrate from the soils, thereby lowering the redox potential and creating anaerobic conditions. Anaerobiosis (Eh less than - 200 mV) promoted the establishment of an anaerobic microbial consortium that degraded <b>dinoseb</b> completely, without the formation of the polymerization products seen under aerobic or microaerophilic conditions. When <b>dinoseb</b> was present at low concentrations in a chronically contaminated soil, the natural microflora was capable of establishing anaerobic conditions and degrading <b>dinoseb</b> as a result of starch degradation. Inoculation of this soil with an aerobic starch-degrading microorganism and then an acclimated, anaerobic, dinoseb-degrading consortium did not improve <b>dinoseb</b> degradation. In a second acutely contaminated soil, these inoculations improved <b>dinoseb</b> degradation rates over those of uninoculated controls...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the ability of}} native microorganisms in various Idaho soils to degrade <b>dinoseb</b> and studied some physical and chemical soil characteristics which might affect the biodegradation process. <b>Dinoseb</b> biodegradation rates were higher in silt-loam soils than in loamy-sand soils. Biodegradation rates were not influenced by previous exposure of the soils to <b>dinoseb.</b> Bacterial numbers, measured by standard plate counts on soil extract agar, were the best predictors of biodegradation rates, accounting for 53 % of the variability between soils. Soil nitrate-N inhibited <b>dinoseb</b> biodegradation and accounted for 39 % of the variability. Sorption of <b>dinoseb</b> to soil surfaces also appeared to influence biodegradation rates. No other soil parameter {{contributed significantly to the}} variability in biodegradation rates. Persistence of <b>dinoseb</b> in one soil was due to inhibition of biodegradation by nitrate, while in another soil persistence appeared to be due to lack of native degradative microorganisms...|$|E
40|$|Investigating the {{influences}} of soil characteristic factors on <b>dinoseb</b> adsorption parameter with different statistical methods would be valuable to explicitly figure out the extent of these influences. The correlation coefficients and the direct, indirect effects of soil characteristic factors on <b>dinoseb</b> adsorption parameter were analyzed through bivariate correlation analysis, and path analysis. With stepwise regression analysis the factors which had little influence on the adsorption parameter were excluded. Results indicate that pH and CEC had moderate relationship and lower direct effect on <b>dinoseb</b> adsorption parameter due to the multicollinearity with other soil factors, and organic carbon and clay contents {{were found to be}} the most significant soil factors which affect the <b>dinoseb</b> adsorption process. A regression is thereby set up to explore the relationship between the <b>dinoseb</b> adsorption parameter and the two soil factors: the soil organic carbon and clay contents. A 92 % of the variation of <b>dinoseb</b> sorption coefficient could be attributed to the variation of the soil organic carbon and clay contents...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDinoseb is a {{herbicide}} {{known to}} inhibit photosystem II electron transfer like DCMU, triazine and phenolic-type herbicides. The mutant Din 7 of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, selected for resistance to <b>dinoseb,</b> and the mutant Ins 2, {{constructed by the}} insertion of the kanamycin resistance cassette into the drgA gene, were cross-resistant to other nitrophenolic herbicides (DNOC, 2, 4 -dinitrophenol) and to the cell inhibitor metronidazole {{but not to the}} photosystem II inhibitors DCMU or ioxynil. The Din 7 mutant had the same characteristics of photosystem II inhibition by <b>dinoseb</b> as the wild type. This result suggested the existence of another site for <b>dinoseb</b> inhibition. The wild type cells modified <b>dinoseb</b> to a non-toxic product that gave an absorption spectrum similar to that of dithionite treated <b>dinoseb</b> containing reduced nitro groups. In contrast, the Din 7 mutant did not modify <b>dinoseb.</b> These phenomena were controlled by the drgA gene encoding a protein which showed similarity to several enzymes having nitroreductase activity. The addition of superoxide dismutase to the medium relieved the toxic effect of <b>dinoseb</b> in wild type cells but not in Din 7. It is proposed that in wild type cells of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 the DrgA protein is involved in detoxification of <b>dinoseb</b> via the reduction of the nitro group(s) and this process is accompanied by the formation of toxic superoxide anions. Mutations blocking the activity of the DrgA protein lead to the development of resistance to nitrophenolic herbicides and metronidazole...|$|E
40|$|A {{strain of}} Clostridium bifermentans, KMR- 1, {{degraded}} 2 -sec-butyl- 4, 6 -dinitrophenol (<b>dinoseb)</b> {{to a level}} below the limit of detection by high-performance liquid chromatography (0. 5 mg/liter) within 96 h, with no accumulation of aromatic intermediates. KMR- 1 could not utilize <b>dinoseb</b> as a sole carbon or energy source, and degradation occurred via cometabolism {{in the presence of}} a fermentable carbon source. KMR- 1 mineralized some <b>dinoseb</b> in anaerobic cultures, evolving 7. 2 % of the radioactive label in U-ring 14 C-labeled <b>dinoseb</b> as 14 CO 2. The remaining anaerobic degradation products were incubated with aerobic soil bacteria, and 35. 4 % of this residual radioactive label was evolved as 14 CO 2. During this mineralization experiment, 38. 9 % of the initial label was evolved as 14 CO 2 after both anaerobic and aerobic phases. This is the first demonstration of <b>dinoseb</b> degradation by a pure microbial culture...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1986 A {{series of}} {{experiments}} were conducted from 1983 to 1985 {{to determine the effects}} of <b>dinoseb</b> [2 -(1 -methylpropyl) - 4, 6 -dinitrophenol] on winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em Thell) yields. Field trials on <b>dinoseb</b> timing and <b>dinoseb</b> plus supplemental pesticides were established in an effort to elucidate the possible factors involved in the yield response of the crop to the herbicide, under weed-free conditions. During the first year (1983 - 1984), <b>dinoseb</b> (1. 7 kg/ha) was applied at several growth stages, from 1 leaf to early booting, to September- and October-planted Yamhill wheat and late October-planted Stephens wheat. Higher yields were obtained in late-planted wheat because of reduced disease attack. The main diseases present during this cropping season were: leaf blotch (Septoria tritici Rob. in Desm.), stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis West.), eyespot foot rot (Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides (Fron) Dei.), and glume blotch (Septoria nodorum (Berk.) Berk.). Early <b>dinoseb</b> applications increased grain yields and prevented or lowered foliar disease attack. Late applications (after the first node stage) decreased yields, probably because of phytotoxicity. However, the general crop response to application times was erratic. Experiments involving supplemental pesticides included, in addition to <b>dinoseb,</b> a) preplant fumigation with 50 g/m² methyl bromide (bromomethane), b) 2. 25 kg/ha phorate 0, 0 - diethyl S-[(ethylthio) methyl] phosphorodithioate preplant incorporated, c) 1. 12 kg/ha benomyl methyl 1 -[(butylamino) carbonyl]- 1 H-benzimidazol- 2 -ylcarbamate applied in February, 1984, and d) repeat applications of 0. 12 kg/ha propiconazole 1 -[2 -(2, 4 -dichlorophenyl) 4 - propyl- 1, 3 -dioxolan- 2 -ylmethyl]- 1 -H- 1, 2, 4 -triazole at flag leaf emergence and at heading. <b>Dinoseb</b> increased grain yields and reduced foliar disease infection. December-applied <b>dinoseb</b> plus propiconazole gave the highest yields as a result of effective disease control. Methyl bromide drastically reduced yield, regardless of <b>dinoseb</b> application, because of lodging. Methyl bromide increased plant height and tiller number, and decreased tiller weight. It also increased eyespot attack. Benomyl was the only pesticide that reduced eyespot incidence. Phorate did not affect any of the variables studied. In the second year (1984 - 1985) experiments on <b>dinoseb</b> timing, <b>dinoseb</b> decreased foliar disease infection (primarily leaf blotch) in most cases, when applied to October-planted Stephens wheat, and yield increases were obtained with earlier applications as in the previous year. Supplemental-fungicide experiments included a) benomyl, b) propiconazole (single application when flag leaf was just visible), and c) repeat applications of 1. 12 kg/ha chlorothalonil (2, 4, 5, 6 - tetrachloro- 1, 3 -benzenedicarbonitrile) at 99...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1970 The {{control of}} filbert (Corylus Avellana L.) suckers {{by means of}} {{herbicides}} was investigated in three phases during 1968 and 1969. (1) Screening trials, on canned filbert trees in the greenhouse, to determine the effectiveness of various herbicides and concentrations in controlling vegetative growth. (2) A summary experiment in the greenhouse to quantitatively {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} the three most promising herbicides selected from the screening trials. (3) Field trials to determine the effectiveness of the three herbicides at various concentrations under field conditions in a mature filbert orchard. One quart of 2, 4 -D, one quart of paraquat, or three pints of <b>dinoseb</b> per 100 gallons of solution gave satisfactory control of filbert suckers. Paraquat and 2, 4 -D controlled the appearance of regrowth {{to a greater extent than}} <b>dinoseb.</b> Use of oil with <b>dinoseb</b> enhanced the effect of the herbicide. Filbert suckers should be treated when less than one foot in height and thoroughly covered with spray to obtain satisfactory kill. The herbicide 2, 4 -D gave better control of larger suckers than either paraquat or <b>dinoseb.</b> No evidence of injury to mature filbert trees was seen where the above rates were used...|$|E
40|$|Dinitrophenolic {{compounds}} {{are powerful}} toxicants {{with a long}} history of use in agriculture and industry. While (high) human exposure levels are not uncommon, in particular for agricultural workers during the spraying season, the neurotoxic mechanism(s) that underlie the human health effects are largely unknown. We therefore investigated the in vitro effects of two dinitrophenolic herbicides (DNOC and <b>dinoseb)</b> on a battery of neurotoxicity endpoints in (dopaminergic) rat PC 12 cells. Cell viability, mitochondrial activity, oxidative stress and caspase activation were assessed using fluorescence-based bioassays (CFDA, alamar Blue, H 2 DCFDA and Ac-DEVD-AMC, respectively), whereas changes in intracellular [Ca(2 +) ]i were assessed using single-cell fluorescence microscopy with Fura- 2 AM. The combined results demonstrate that exposure to both DNOC and <b>dinoseb</b> is linked to calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum and activation of caspase-mediated apoptotic pathways. In subsequent experiments, immunofluorescent labelling with specific antibodies was used to determine changes in intracellular α-synuclein levels, demonstrating that both DNOC and <b>dinoseb</b> increase levels of intracellular α-synuclein. The combined results indicate that in vitro exposure to DNOC and <b>dinoseb</b> activates pathways that are not only involved in acute neurotoxicity but also in long-term effects as seen in neurodegeneration...|$|E
