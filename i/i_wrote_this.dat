We're gonna have to do it. We're gonna have to re-build the Wiltern Theater, which they had taken down, it was {{a million dollars to}} re-do the ending... and I felt all his hostility for Universal. A guy named Sean Daniels, who was head of production, one day said to me, well there is hostility because we {{understand}} you waited about eight months to come up with that final song and you never did it. I said, where'd you hear that? I did it in two days. He said, Jimmy Iovine. So I went to Jimmy Iovine and I said all that to his, yeah it's true, I know. I blamed you but you can't be upset with me. I'm not like a writer. I've gotta make my way with these people. I had to have a scapegoat.|$|E

She wanted to write a song that could define where she was with Born This Way and her life. In an {{interview}} with NME, Gaga explained that the main inspiration behind the song was singer Whitney Houston and also added: [...] "This song is about me going back to New York. <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>this</b> about the courage it took for me to say 'I hate Hollywood, I just wanna live in Brooklyn and make music'".|$|E

I read that <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>this</b> song and I wrote these lyrics and that's not my style. I would never do that." [...] Annet Artani, who co-wrote Spears' 2003 song [...] "Everytime", stated that the song was written as a response to [...] "Cry Me a River". When asked during an interview with Diane Sawyer on PrimeTime in 2003, if [...] "Everytime" [...] was about Timberlake, Spears responded, [...] "I'll let the song speak for itself." ...|$|E
500|$|Actor and playwright Tony Roper wrote a play {{entitled}} Celts in Seville, {{the story}} of a typical Celtic supporting-family following Celtic over the course of their run to the UEFA Cup final in Seville. The play enjoyed a successful initial run in 2008, and a similarly successful rerun in 2014. Tony Roper wrote the play to highlight the passionate but good-natured support of Celtic fans during the UEFA Cup campaign, stating [...] "The reason <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>this</b> was not to celebrate Celtic not winning the UEFA cup, the reason I wrote the play was to celebrate Celtic supporters' way of not winning the cup." ...|$|E
500|$|At the iHeartRadio Music Festival in Las Vegas on September 24, 2011, Gaga {{dedicated}} {{a performance}} of [...] "Hair" [...] to deceased teenager Jamey Rodemeyer, who had committed suicide after being constantly bullied by his peers at school for being gay. An image of Rodemeyer was shown on the backdrop as Gaga announced: [...] "We lost a Little Monster this week. <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>this</b> record about how your identity is really all you've got when you're in school... so tonight, Jamey, I know you're up there looking at us, and you're not a victim... you're a lesson to all of us.

500|$|Jackson stated {{several times}} that [...] "Billie Jean" [...] {{was based on the}} groupies he and his {{brothers}} encountered while part of The Jackson 5. [...] "Billie Jean is kind of anonymous. It represents a lot of girls. They used to call them groupies in the '60s." [...] He added: [...] "They would hang around backstage doors, and any band that would come to town they would have a relationship with, and I think <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>this</b> out of experience with my brothers when I was little. There were a lot of Billie Jeans out there. Every girl claimed that their son was related to one of my brothers." [...] The reason for this was due to the fame of the Jackson 5, and wanting to have their money {{in order to have a}} way of living.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{story by}} Michael Halperin contained a different subplot involving {{a problem with}} the dilithium in the warp drive of the Enterprise. The diplomatic conference was added by D.C. Fontana when it was developed into a teleplay. Fontana had previously worked on , including the episode [...] "Journey to Babel". [...] "Lonely Among Us" [...] was subsequently compared to [...] "Journey to Babel", which Fontana denied, saying, [...] "I wrote 'Journey to Babel' and <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>this</b> too, and I feel there is a difference. There's a definite delineation and separation here, both in intent and content." [...] Director Cliff Bole did not recall much of the episode later, but did not think much of the script, saying [...] "The subject matter affects the end product. There's some better written shows, obviously." [...] It was the first episode of The Next Generation to be directed by Bole, who had previously worked on shows such as V and The Six Million Dollar Man.|$|E
500|$|After Jean's {{version of}} [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] was {{rejected}} by her record company, she was upset that Beyoncé recorded and released the ballad. Roger Friedman of Fox News wrote that Jean was first informed that Beyoncé recorded the song by a stranger. The Daily Telegraph reported that Beyoncé's father and then-manager Mathew Knowles pursued the publishing rights of [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] after realizing that it {{had the potential to}} become a big hit. Jean used her Myspace account to express her frustration: [...] "I have been reading some of these comments and {{to set the record straight}} from the horse's mouth – IF I WERE A BOY is my song; YES, <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>this</b> song; It is my story; a painful one, and the song is very dear to me. You can hear the original version on my myspace site." [...] Friedman later reported that Beyoncé and Jean had come to terms. The deal included a promise that Beyoncé would record a duet with Jean for her debut album.|$|E

500|$|The track [...] "Old Age", whose organ intro was {{featured}} on the band's cover of [...] "Credit In The Straight World" [...] from Live Through This, was revealed to have originally written by Kurt Cobain; Love stated in a 1997 interview that [...] "Old Age" [...] was [...] "partly someone else's composition. It's something somebody {{had a little bit}} of and I said 'let me have the rest of it' and <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>this</b> thing in it and tried to make it goth. I found it, wrote it, and recorded it the same night." [...] It was later revealed that a version of the song was recorded by Nirvana during the Nevermind (1991) recording sessions, but Cobain threw the song out, later giving the melody to Love, who rearranged musical pieces and rewrote the lyrics. Two live cover versions were included on the album: [...] "Season of the Witch" [...] by Donovan, and [...] "He Hit Me (And It Felt Like a Kiss)", which was written by Carole King and recorded by The Crystals in the 1960s. Love referred to it as a [...] "feminist anthem" [...] after performing it during MTV Unplugged in 1995.|$|E
500|$|Gaga's {{cover of}} [...] "White Christmas" [...] is a [...] "jazzy rendition" [...] and {{features}} an extra verse about a snowman. Halfway into the cover, before beginning the new verse, Gaga says, [...] "So {{as you can}} tell, I'm very outgoing {{and a little bit}} shy, but I've decided that this song is just too short. It's such a beautiful Christmas song but it's only one verse, so I added an extra one." [...] "You and I" [...] is devoid of the musical arrangements from the version in Born This Way, and features instrumentation from a piano and a trumpet, which is played halfway through the song. From time to time, Gaga shouts the word [...] "America" [...] while singing the song. Her acoustic version of [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] begins with a monologue, explaining her dedication of the song to her grandfather: [...] "It's the second Thanksgiving I'm spending without my grandpa, and <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>this</b> song about him, so here it is. So Grandma, if you're watching at home, this one's for you." [...] Following the first chorus, Gaga stops playing her piano and tells a story about Italian cookies. A recurring theme for the songs is Gaga stopping midway through singing to engage in conversation with the listeners.|$|E
500|$|Several later {{commentators}} have interpreted the {{play as a}} reflection of Rand's early interest in the ideas of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Literature professor Shoshana Milgram saw elements of Nietzsche's morality in the descriptions of Bjorn Faulkner, who [...] "never thought of things as right or wrong". Others found significance in Rand's admiration of the play's criminal characters. Historian Jennifer Burns said Rand [...] "found criminality an irresistible metaphor for individualism" [...] because of the influence on her of [...] "Nietzsche's transvaluation of values [...] changed criminals into heroes". Rand maintained criminality was not the important attribute of the characters; she said a criminal could serve as [...] "an eloquent symbol" [...] of independence and rebellion against conformity, but stated, [...] "I do not think, nor did I think when <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>this</b> play, that a swindler is a heroic character or that a respectable banker is a villain". Rand biographer Ronald Merrill dismissed this explanation as a cover-up for the play's promotion of Nietzschean ideas that Rand later rejected. He called the play [...] "a powerful and eloquent plea for the Nietzschean worldview" [...] of the superiority of the [...] "superman"; this is represented by Faulkner, whom Merrill interprets as rejecting external moral authority and the [...] "slave morality" [...] of ordinary people. Biographer Anne Heller said Rand [...] "later renounced her romantic fascination with criminals", making the characters' criminality an embarrassment for her.|$|E

500|$|The downtempo {{song was}} {{developed}} {{on the following}} day, with Madonna writing the lyrics and Leonard composing the melody. Named [...] "The Look of Love", the song contains the line [...] "No where to run, no place to hide. From the look of love, from the eyes of pride". Madonna {{was inspired by the}} look that actor James Stewart gave actress Grace Kelly in the 1954 film Rear Window. Madonna said: [...] "I can't describe it, but that is the way I want someone to look at me when he loves me. It's the most pure look of love and adoration. Like surrender. It's devastating." [...] After [...] "The Look of Love", Madonna went on to develop two further songs with Bray as the producer. The first was called [...] "Causing a Commotion", and was inspired by Penn and the couple's often tumultuous relationship. Madonna felt that her marriage to Penn {{was on the verge of}} breaking-up, due to Penn's abusive and violent nature. In a Rolling Stone article dated September 10, 1987, Madonna spoke about Penn's impact on her life and the song: [...] "I don't like violence. I never condone hitting anyone, and I never thought that any violence should have taken place. But on the other hand, I understood Sean's anger and believe me, I have wanted to hit him many times. I never would you know, because I realize that it would just make things worse. [...] I felt like he was 'Causing a Commotion' to purposefully distract me. <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>this</b> song and vented my frustration in it." [...] The last song developed was [...] "Can't Stop", a track inspired by Sixties Motown and the group Martha and the Vandellas. In addition to this, the album also included tracks by some acts on Warner Bros. Records, namely Club Nouveau, Scritti Politti and Michael Davidson. Commercially unsuccessful and unknown in the US, these groups needed a platform to project their songs, and including them in a Madonna album seemed like the right thing to do for Warner. Two tracks by Duncan Faure and Coati Mundi were included on the soundtrack at the request of Madonna since they were her friends. Despite her only performing four of the nine tracks on the album, Who's That Girl was marketed as a Madonna album, with only her face and name appearing on the cover art.|$|E

2500|$|Wilson {{also criticized}} {{scientific}} types with overly rigid belief systems, equating them with religious fundamentalists in their fanaticism. In a 1988 interview, {{when asked about}} his newly published book , Wilson commented: I coined the term irrational rationalism because those people claim to be rationalists, but they're governed by such a heavy body of taboos. They're so fearful, and so hostile, and so narrow, and frightened, and uptight and dogmatic... <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>this</b> book because I got tired satirizing fundamentalist Christianity... I decided to satirize fundamentalist materialism for a change, because the two are equally comical... The materialist fundamentalists are funnier than the Christian fundamentalists, because they think they're rational! ...They're never skeptical about anything except the things they have a prejudice against. None of them ever says anything skeptical about the AMA, or about anything in establishment science or any entrenched dogma. They're only skeptical about new ideas that frighten them. They're actually dogmatically committed to what they were taught when they were in college....|$|E
2500|$|Among other songs is {{the ballad}} [...] "Speechless", {{which is a}} 1970s rock-inspired number that talks about abusive relationships: [...] "I can't believe how you slurred at me with your half-wired broken jaw". It {{consists}} of vocal harmonies and guitar riffs, which according to PopMatters, {{is comparable to the}} work of Freddie Mercury and Queen. Gaga's inspiration behind the track was her father's heart condition, and her fear about his death. Gaga recalled that her [...] "dad used to call after he'd had a few drinks and I wouldn't know what to say. I was speechless and I just feared that I would lose him and I wouldn't be there. <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>this</b> song as a plea to him." [...] Produced by Ron Fair, [...] "Speechless" [...] was recorded with all live instruments such as drums, guitars, bass and piano played by Gaga. The album's fifth track, [...] "Dance in the Dark", talks about a girl being uncomfortable having sex with the lights on, so she would prefer to perform it in the [...] "dark". Gaga has [...] "resolute" [...] vocals in the song, and the synths ultimately lead to the chorus where she belts, [...] "Baby loves to Dance in the Dark, 'Cause when he's looking she falls apart".|$|E
2500|$|... "The Ballad of Mona Lisa" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} by Alternative Press as [...] " [...] the upbeat pop energy of A Fever You Can't Sweat Out, with the focus and clarity of Pretty. Odd." [...] Urie has explained that he and Smith desired to achieve a sound that is more similar to the former: [...] "We missed a couple things from our first record in terms of sonically, with these little instruments that we hadn’t really used on our second record. There [...] a lot of organic instruments and not a lot of electronics or synthesizers. So we wanted to get back to some of that." [...] Smith agreed, and stated [...] "I think there's stuff from the first album that we kind of got away from on the second record that people who were fans of the first one will enjoy." [...] "The Calendar", originally written about an intimate relationship between a male and a female, soon began to resemble the friendships in former members Ross and Walker; the song was finished as a direct response to their departure from the group. [...] "Sarah Smiles" [...] was written for Urie's wife. [...] "'Sarah Smiles' is about my girlfriend, actually, as sappy as that is," [...] he told Spin in 2011. [...] "When I met her <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>this</b> song to try and impress her. I was infatuated with her. I played it for her and we've been dating ever since. That was a huge step for me, personally." [...] "Nearly Witches (Ever Since We Met...)" [...] was rejected for inclusion on Pretty. Odd. due it not fitting within the concept of the album; Urie and Smith finished the song for Vices & Virtues.|$|E
