5|$|For {{the purpose}} of water quality {{measurement}} the river is divided into five water body areas by the Environment Agency. Both the area from the source to Broad River around Crewkerne and the area from Broad River to Lopen Brook are rated good for chemical quality and moderate <b>for</b> <b>ecological</b> quality. The area from Lopen Brook to the River Isle, around Martock and South Petherton, is rated good for chemical quality, poor <b>for</b> <b>ecological</b> quality and poor overall. From the River Isle to River Yeo around Muchelney, chemical quality is rated good, and ecology is rated moderate. The section around Langport to the West Sedgemoor Drain continues to rate good for chemical quality and moderate <b>for</b> <b>ecological</b> quality, as does the final area leading to Bridgwater Bay.|$|E
5|$|Management {{of human}} {{consumption}} of resources is an indirect approach based largely on information gained from economics. Herman Daly has suggested three broad criteria <b>for</b> <b>ecological</b> sustainability: renewable resources should provide a sustainable yield (the rate of harvest should not exceed the rate of regeneration); for non-renewable resources there should be equivalent development of renewable substitutes; waste generation should not exceed the assimilative capacity of the environment.|$|E
5|$|The {{state of}} grizzly bear populations in Banff {{is seen as}} a proxy <b>for</b> <b>ecological</b> integrity. To keep bears away from humans, an {{electric}} fence was put up around the summer gondola and parking lot at Lake Louise in 2001. Bear-proof garbage cans, which do not allow bears to access their contents, help to deter them from human sites. The fruit of Buffaloberry bushes is eaten by bears, so the bushes have been removed in some areas where the risk of a bear–human encounter is high.|$|E

5|$|Heathens {{commonly}} adopt a cosmology {{based on}} that found in Norse mythology. As part of this framework, humanity's world—known as Midgard—is regarded as just one of nine realms, {{all of which are}} part of a cosmological world tree called Yggdrasil. Different types of being are believed to inhabit these different realms; for instance, humans live on Midgard, while dwarves live on another realm, elves on another, giants on another, and the divinities on two further realms. Most practitioners believe that this is a poetic or symbolic description of the cosmos, with the different levels representing higher realms beyond the material plane of existence. The world tree is also interpreted by some in the community as an icon <b>for</b> <b>ecological</b> and social engagement. Some Heathens, such as the psychologist Brian Bates, have adopted an approach to this cosmology rooted in analytical psychology, thereby interpreting the nine worlds and their inhabitants as maps of the human mind.|$|E
5|$|The {{scope of}} ecology {{contains}} {{a wide array}} of interacting levels of organization spanning micro-level (e.g., cells) to a planetary scale (e.g., biosphere) phenomena. Ecosystems, for example, contain abiotic resources and interacting life forms (i.e., individual organisms that aggregate into populations which aggregate into distinct ecological communities). Ecosystems are dynamic, they do not always follow a linear successional path, but they are always changing, sometimes rapidly and sometimes so slowly that it can take thousands of years <b>for</b> <b>ecological</b> processes to bring about certain successional stages of a forest. An ecosystem's area can vary greatly, from tiny to vast. A single tree is of little consequence to the classification of a forest ecosystem, but critically relevant to organisms living in and on it. Several generations of an aphid population can exist over the lifespan of a single leaf. Each of those aphids, in turn, support diverse bacterial communities. The nature of connections in ecological communities cannot be explained by knowing the details of each species in isolation, because the emergent pattern is neither revealed nor predicted until the ecosystem is studied as an integrated whole. Some ecological principles, however, do exhibit collective properties where the sum of the components explain the properties of the whole, such as birth rates of a population being equal to the sum of individual births over a designated time frame.|$|E

25|$|In some nations, {{such as the}} United Kingdom, United States, Australia, and New Zealand, {{imported}} alien crayfish are {{a danger}} to local rivers. The three species commonly imported to Europe from the Americas are Orconectes limosus, Pacifastacus leniusculus and Procambarus clarkii. Crayfish may spread into different bodies of water because specimens captured for pets in one river are often released into a different catchment. There is a potential <b>for</b> <b>ecological</b> damage when crayfish are introduced into non-native bodies of water (e.g., crayfish plague in Europe).|$|E
25|$|Heidegger’s {{critique}} of technology has certainly inspired environmentalist and postmodernist of our time.
