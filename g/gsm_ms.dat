The payoff is ∥ BA ∥s. In particular, for <b>Gs(M)</b> ≡ Gs(R, <b>M,</b> R) let B be the unit ball of M. Then B is a convex body symmetric about 0, the minimizer selects P ϵ ∂B while the maximizer selects a support hyperplane α to B. Let OP meet α at Q (possibly at infinity). The payoff is ¦ OPOQ ¦s. Values and properties of such games are investigated. Among the applications of interest in functional analysis is the following. For t ϵ [0, 1] let u(t) ϵ M 1 and A(t) : M 1 → M 2 (linear), A(·) square integrable. Then the supremum of ∥ ∫ 01 A(t) u(t) dt ∥ 2 over all u(·) satisfying ∫ 01 ∥ u(t) ∥ 2 dt ⩽ 1 is no less than (dimM 2) − 1 ∫ 01 ∥ A(t) ∥ 2 dt and this bound is sharp for every choice of M 1, M 2...|$|R

5000|$|The {{transcoder}} {{is responsible}} for transcoding the voice channel coding between the coding used in the mobile network, and the coding used by the world's terrestrial circuit-switched network, the Public Switched Telephone Network. Specifically, GSM uses a regular pulse excited-long term prediction (RPE-LTP) coder for voice data between the mobile device and the BSS, but pulse code modulation (A-law or μ-law standardized in ITU G.711) upstream of the BSS. RPE-LPC coding results in a data rate for voice of 13 kbit/s where standard PCM coding results in 64 kbit/s. Because of this change in data rate for the same voice call, the transcoder also has a buffering function so that PCM 8-bit words can be recoded to construct <b>GSM</b> 20 <b>ms</b> traffic blocks.|$|R

For θ and δ limit ordinals <μ^+ both with cofinality ≥κ_μ(K), if K satisfies symmetry for non-μ-splitting (or just (μ,δ) -symmetry), then, for any M_ 1 and M_ 2 that are (μ,θ) and (μ,δ) -limit models over M_ 0, respectively, we have that M_ 1 and M_ 2 are isomorphic over M_ 0.

40|$|A prepaid energy {{metering}} system enables power utilities to collect energy bills from the consumers’ {{prior to the}} usage of power by delivering {{only as much as}} what has been paid for. In Nigeria, the current prepaid meters use the keypad technology or smart card for their energy re-loading or recharging. This poses some challenges because the consumers have to travel a long distance to the utility company, waste {{a lot of time and}} energy before getting his/her energy meter activated when out of energy credit. In this paper, an SMS-recharge system for prepaid meter is proposed whereby consumers at the comfort of their homes, without stress or waste of energy or time, can recharge/activate their meters via SMS without the use of keypad by sending a 12 -digit Pin number via SMS to the utility company. The aim of this paper is to model an intelligent billing system and develop an SMS protocol for the recharge scheme. This work contains the methodology and developed SMS protocol-link between the <b>GSM</b> modem (<b>M</b> 20) and the Microcontroller (PIC 18 F 2550) for this process. The entire billing process is designed and simulated in Matlab/Simulink environments. Results obtained are very satisfactory. When fully implemented in Nigeria, revenue generation in the power sector will greatly increase as more sales of energy vouchers will be made...|$|R
40|$|Kitemill is {{developing}} {{a new concept to}} harness wind energy. Their concept is shaped like a glider, and takes advantage of the high wind speeds at high altitudes. Operations in such environments require strong and lightweight materials. This thesis will focus on the production method, material type and lay-up for a structural composite beam inside the horizontal stabilizer. Kitemill currently use wet lay-up bladder moulding technique to make the part. In this process where an inflatable bicycle tube is used to generate pressure on the composite in a closed mould. The maximum load of the piece they made by this process was set as the benchmark loading. The material used in this production method is a combination between Textreme (76 <b>gsm)</b> and Renlam <b>M</b> 1 Epoxy. This material combination was tested according to the ASTM standard of composite testing, with some simplifications. The laminate constants were calculated from these results. These constants were used to create an Abaqus model which simulated the bladder moulded beam in a three-point bending test. A second production technique was created. The aim was to build a sample that could take the benchmark loading, but weighing less. This was done by creating a parametric optimization of lay-up for composites with the software program Isight. This lay-up was used together with a compression moulding technique where a core-material is squeezed into the mould. Pre-Preg composite material was used for this concept. The results indicated that the focus should be changes from the maximum load to production quality. The compression moulding production technique seems to be a better alternative than the bladder moulding technique due to air bubbles in the laminate. However, this is a more expensive production technique. The structure of the optimization program is good, but it needs some adjustments before it can be useful for real design applications. The program was computational heavy because the program had too many variables. There was also a problem with the way the simulation was set up. The result av this was that Abaqus ignored the difference between a continuous ply and a non-continuous ply. The conclusion is that the bladder molding technique can be used for the prototype glider, but the material should be changed to Pre-preg to minimize production flaws...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a feasibility study on unobtrusive localization of GSM en- abled cellphones using a Fake Base Station (FBS). An FBS is a radio transceiver that emulates the behaviour of a legitimate GSM Base Station (BS) to fool unal- tered cellphones {{to connect with}} it. This feasibility study investigates how an FBS can be utilized to estimate positions of connected cellphones {{in an area of}} interest. We present a proof of concept system that consists of a mobile FBS that measures the Time Of Arrival (TOA) and Received Signal Strength (RSS) to a cell- phone. The positions of the mobile FBS are determined with GPS. We employ calibration-free localization algorithms as we assume unknown environments and unknown hardware. Our experiments in an outdoor 180 x 100 m 2 Line-Of- Sight (LOS) environment show that our calibration-free localization algorithms provide an average localization error less than 10 meters, which is sufficient for most applications of interest. In addition, our experiments show that RSS-based localization outperforms TOA-based localization when the average distance be- tween the FBS and cellphone is roughly 50 meters. Our experiments show that TOA-based localization outperforms RSS-based localization when the average dis- tance increases to roughly 75 meters. This research is part of the Smart Savannah project in which a wide range of different surveillance systems are developed to protect rhinos from poachers. We envision that our localization system can be used to detect and localize these poachers in an unobtrusive way. In addition, we envision that our localization sys- tem can be used in Search And Rescue (SAR) operations to estimate the positions of cellphones of missing persons.  Detta examensarbete undersöker möjligheten att lokalisera mobiltelefoner <b>med</b> <b>GSM</b> teknologi genom att använda en Falsk Basstation (FBS).
