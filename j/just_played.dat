5|$|Chazz Palminteri as U.S. Customs Special Agent Dave Kujan. Singer {{had always}} wanted the actor for the film, {{but he was always}} unavailable. The role was offered to Christopher Walken and Robert De Niro, both of whom turned it down. The filmmakers even had Al Pacino come in and read for the part, but he decided not to do it because he had <b>just</b> <b>played</b> a cop in Heat. Palminteri became available, but only for a week. When he signed on, this persuaded the film's {{financial}} backers to support the film fully because he was a sufficiently high-profile star, thanks to the recent release of A Bronx Tale and Bullets Over Broadway.|$|E

25|$|The {{position}} at right occurred in Gelfand–Kramnik, 1994 FIDE Candidates match, game 6, in Sanghi Nagar, India. Vladimir Kramnik (Black), down two pawns {{and on the}} defensive, would be very happy with a draw. Boris Gelfand (White) has <b>just</b> <b>played</b> 67. Re4–e7?, a strong-looking move that threatens 68.Qxf6, winning a third pawn, or 68.Rc7, further constricting Black. Black responded 67... Qc1! If White takes Black's undefended rook with 68.Qxd8, Black's desperado queen forces the draw with 68...Qh1+ 69.Kg3 Qh2+!, compelling 70.Kxh2 stalemate (second diagram). If White avoids the stalemate with 68.Rxg7+ Kxg7 69.Qxd8, Black draws by perpetual check with 69...Qh1+ 70.Kg3 Qg1+ 71.Kf4 Qc1+! 72.Ke4 Qc6+! 73.Kd3!?

25|$|At the 1960 U.S. Open, Nicklaus shot a two-under par 282, {{finishing}} {{in second}} place two strokes behind Arnold Palmer, who won the tournament for the only time with a final round charge of six-under-par 65. This score remains the lowest ever by an amateur in the U.S. Open. Nicklaus played the final 36 holes with Ben Hogan, who later remarked that he had <b>just</b> <b>played</b> 36 holes with a kid who should have won by 10 shots. During the final 36 holes, Nicklaus was two-under-par; he had shot every round of the tournament at or below par, the only entrant to do so. Nicklaus had led by two shots with six holes to play. In 1960, Nicklaus also tied for 13th in the Masters Tournament. He tied for fourth in the 1961 U.S. Open, three shots behind champion Gene Littler, having played the final 54 holes one under par. Each of these three major championship finishes designated Nicklaus as low amateur. However, Nicklaus' one-under-par 287 tied for seventh in the 1961 Masters Tournament, and was second that year only to Charles Coe's low amateur placing, when he tied for second with Arnold Palmer at seven-under par 281, one shot behind champion Gary Player.|$|E

500|$|Dylan's topical songs {{enhanced}} {{his early}} reputation, {{and he came}} to be seen as more than just a songwriter. Janet Maslin wrote of Freewheelin: [...] "These were the songs that established [...] as the voice of his generation—someone who implicitly understood how concerned young Americans felt about nuclear disarmament and the growing Civil Rights Movement: his mixture of moral authority and nonconformity was perhaps the most timely of his attributes." [...] Freewheelin also included love songs and surreal talking blues. Humor was an important part of Dylan's persona, and the range of material on the album impressed listeners, including the Beatles. George Harrison said of the album, [...] "We <b>just</b> <b>played</b> it, just wore it out. The content of the song lyrics and just the attitude—it was incredibly original and wonderful." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{capitalise}} on their chart {{success in the}} US, the band returned to the studio in June 1970, just four months after Black Sabbath was released. The new album was initially set to be named War Pigs after the song [...] "War Pigs", which was critical of the Vietnam War; however, Warner changed {{the title of the}} album to Paranoid. The album's lead-off single, [...] "Paranoid", was written in the studio at the last minute. Ward explains: [...] "We didn't have enough songs for the album, and Tony <b>just</b> <b>played</b> the [...] guitar lick and that was it. It took twenty, twenty-five minutes from top to bottom." [...] The single was released in September 1970 and reached number four on the UK charts, remaining Black Sabbath's only top ten hit.

500|$|On April 21, 2009, The Greencards {{released}} {{their fourth}} studio album, Fascination. Warner describes the album as [...] "their most focused" [...] work. On their previous albums, the three band members had individually put forward {{ideas for the}} music, until enough cohered into the finished work. For Fascination, he says they put aside their individual pride to create a stronger work. The years of touring experience The Greencards have accumulated since their earliest work has helped them, as well. Referring to when they formed the band, he said, [...] "We <b>just</b> <b>played</b> in Austin. We just wrote probably anything, which was the only stuff we knew, which {{was more of a}} traditional thing. But since then, we've had five or six years of touring, all of the experiences, all of the people you meet. We've been so fortunate to play at all of these festivals which have a really eclectic form of music styles." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1962, {{while playing}} a gig at the Pypo Club in Seaside, Oregon, the band noticed Rockin' Robin Roberts's version of [...] "Louie Louie" [...] being {{played on the}} jukebox for hours on end. The entire club would get up and dance. Ely {{convinced}} the Kingsmen to learn the song, which they played at dances to a great crowd response. Unknown to him, he changed the beat from 1-2-3-4, 1–2, 1-2-3-4, 1–2 to 1-2-3, 1–2, 1-2-3, 1–2 because he based it on the intro only. Ken Chase, host of radio station KISN, formed his own club to capitalize on these dance crazes. Dubbed [...] "The Chase", the Kingsmen became the club's house band and Ken Chase became the band's manager. Ely was begging Chase to let the band record {{their own version of}} [...] "Louie Louie", and on April 5, 1963, Chase booked the band an hour-long session at the local Northwestern Inc. studio for the following day. The band had <b>just</b> <b>played</b> a 90-minute [...] "Louie Louie" [...] marathon.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} stage of recording, Sly and Robbie focused {{primarily}} on constructing difficult grooves for songs. To record their rhythm tracks, Dunbar worked in the studio alone and cut a drum part without having a melody in mind. He recounted his approach for the album to Musician, saying that [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>played</b> what I felt, working {{from a sense of}} 'now I'll do 103 beats per minute.' And Robbie would come in the next night and lay a bass part." [...] Unlike most reggae or funk bassists, Shakespeare approached his playing as a jazz soloist and attempted numerous subtle variations to his riff. He said that his inspiration [...] "comes from God. Sometimes endless ideas just keep coming to me. Sometimes I'll change the drum pattern to a bass line and Sly will play the bass line on the drums." [...] Along with live percussion, Dunbar played Simmons drums, and the duo integrated contemporary electronic music technology such as the Fairlight CMI synthesizer in the album's recording. Dunbar used his recorded live drums to trigger the synthesizer's sampled drum sounds.|$|E
500|$|With {{the script}} {{following}} the novel {{more closely than}} the other film adaptations of the eponymous source novels, there are several continuity errors due to the film taking place in a different order, such as Blofeld not recognising Bond, despite having met him face-to-face in the previous film You Only Live Twice. In the original script, Bond undergoes plastic surgery to disguise him from his enemies; the intention was to allow an unrecognisable Bond to infiltrate Blofeld's hideout and help the audience accept the new actor in the role. However, this was dropped in favour of ignoring the change in actor. To make audiences not forget {{it was the same}} James Bond, <b>just</b> <b>played</b> by another actor, the producers inserted many references to the previous films, some as in-jokes. These include Bond breaking the fourth wall by stating [...] "This never happened to the other fellow", the credits sequence with images from the previous instalments, Bond visiting his office and finding objects from Dr. No, From Russia with Love and Thunderball, and a caretaker whistling the theme from Goldfinger.|$|E
