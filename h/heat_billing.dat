25|$|When President Carter {{created the}} U.S. Department of Energy in 1977, {{one of their}} first {{successful}} projects was the Weatherization Assistance Program. During the last 30 years, this program has provided services to more than 5.5 million low-income families. On average, low-cost weatherization reduces <b>heating</b> <b>bills</b> by 31% and overall energy bills by $358 per year at current prices. Increased energy efficiency and weatherization spending has a high return on investment.|$|R

50|$|After {{that long}} period of success, due {{to changes in the}} {{publishing}} industry and the loss of his aging readership, Doubleday dropped Girzone without any warning after the lackluster release in 2007 of Joshua's Family.

He eventually sold the Maryland facility.|$|R
50|$|Energy Star {{qualified}} heat pumps, boilers, {{air conditioning}} systems, and furnaces are available. In addition, cooling and <b>heating</b> <b>bills</b> can be significantly lowered with air sealing and duct sealing. Air sealing reduces the outdoor air that penetrates a building, and duct sealing prevents attic or basement air from entering ducts and lessening the heating/cooling system’s efficiency. Energy Star qualified room air conditioners {{are at least}} 10% more energy efficient than the minimum U.S. federal government standards.|$|R
50|$|An {{unexpected}} {{legacy and}} benefit from the abandoned coal mines is being realized {{in the form of}} geothermal energy. Since their closure, the mines have filled with ground water which is heated to an average temperature of 18° C (65 °F) by the surrounding earth. Beginning in the late 1980s, this heat source has been exploited by companies located in Springhill's industrial park, situated on the land where the surface facilities of the coal mines were located, reducing winter <b>heating</b> <b>bills</b> substantially.|$|R

50|$|In June 2014, {{a system}} of high {{efficiency}} heat pumps was installed in The Blaine House {{in an effort to}} reduce the <b>heating</b> <b>bill,</b> after a test of one over the winter in the Governor's sleeping quarters. With heating oil, The Blaine House used 5,074 gallons of oil at a cost of $16,775 in 2013. The oil boiler is also going to be converted to natural gas in a further effort to reduce costs, though that system will only be needed on the coldest days. The total cost of the upgrades is expected to be $115,000.|$|R

Houses in the district, already the largest in the city, have some of the highest property tax valuations in the Capital District region, from $200–400,000.

For example, Denmark, a pioneering country in implementing DH and which already has {{a greater number of}} DH customers per head of population than any other country, has for long been concerned with metering.
