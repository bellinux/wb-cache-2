5000|$|<b>Huntite</b> is a {{carbonate}} mineral {{with the}} chemical formula Mg3Ca(CO3)4. [...] <b>Huntite</b> crystallizes in the trigonal system and typically occurs as platy crystals and powdery masses.

50|$|<b>Huntite</b> often {{occurs in}} {{combination}} with other Mg/Ca carbonates such as dolomite, magnesite, and hydromagnesite. Large deposits of <b>huntite</b> occur in Turkey and Greece and these are commercially exploited because of its fire retardant properties. <b>Huntite</b> thermally decomposes over a temperature range of about 450-800 °C, releasing carbon dioxide and leaving a residue of magnesium and calcium oxides.|$|E

5000|$|Commonly used fire {{retardant}} additives include mixtures of <b>huntite</b> and hydromagnesite, aluminium hydroxide, and magnesium hydroxide. When heated, aluminium hydroxide dehydrates to form aluminum oxide (alumina, Al2O3), releasing water vapor in the process. This reaction absorbs {{a great deal}} of heat, cooling the material into which it is incorporated. Additionally, the residue of alumina forms a protective layer on the material's surface. Mixtures of <b>huntite</b> and hydromagnesite work in a similar manner. They endothermically decompose releasing both water and carbon dioxide, [...] giving {{fire retardant}} properties [...] to the materials in which they are incorporated.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{industrial}} use of <b>huntite</b> is {{as a natural}} mixture with hydromagnesite as a flame retardant or fire retardant additive for polymers. [...] The heat of a fire will cause <b>huntite</b> to decompose releasing carbon dioxide into the flames. This helps to slow {{the spread of the}} fire. The release of carbon dioxide is endothermic, meaning that it takes in heat, this action helps to cool the burning material, again slowing the spread of the fire. These types of mixtures are used as alternatives to the more commonly used aluminium hydroxide.|$|E

50|$|Synthetic brucite {{is mainly}} {{consumed}} as {{a precursor to}} magnesia (MgO), a useful refractory insulator.

5000|$|<b>Huntite</b> {{has been}} found in a variety of environments.

5000|$|Its {{most common}} {{industrial}} use is as a mixture with <b>huntite</b> as a flame retardant or fire retardant additive for polymers. [...] Hydromagnesite decomposes endothermically, giving off water and carbon dioxide, leaving a magnesium oxide residue.

50|$|Some {{compounds}} {{break down}} endothermically when subjected to high temperatures. Magnesium and aluminium hydroxides are an example, together with various carbonates and hydrates such as mixtures of <b>huntite</b> and hydromagnesite. The reaction removes {{heat from the}} substrate, thereby cooling the material. The use of hydroxides and hydrates is limited by their relatively low decomposition temperature, which limits the maximum processing temperature of the polymers (typically used in polyolefins for wire and cable applications).|$|E
5000|$|The {{individual}} crystals of anthodites {{develop in}} a form described as “acicular” (needle-like) and often branch out as they grow. They usually grow downward from a cave's ceiling. Aragonite crystals are contrasted with those made of calcite (another variety of calcium carbonate) in that the latter tend to be stubby or dog-tooth-like (“rhombohedral”, rather than acicular). Anthodites often have a solid core of aragonite and may have <b>huntite</b> or hydromagnesite deposited near {{the ends of the}} branches.|$|E
50|$|Aluminium {{hydroxide}} {{also finds}} {{use as a}} fire retardant filler for polymer applications {{in a similar way}} to magnesium hydroxide and mixtures of <b>huntite</b> and hydromagnesite. It decomposes at about 180 C, absorbing a considerable amount of heat in the process and giving off water vapour. In addition to behaving as a fire retardant, it is very effective as a smoke suppressant {{in a wide range of}} polymers, most especially in polyesters, acrylics, ethylene vinyl acetate, epoxies, PVC and rubber.|$|E
50|$|The heat {{absorbed by}} the {{reaction}} retards the fire by delaying ignition of the associated substance. The water released dilutes combustible gases. Common uses of magnesium hydroxide as a flame retardant include additives to cable insulation (i.e. cables for high quality cars, submarines, the Airbus A380, the Playstation 4, etc.), insulation plastics, roofing (e.g. London Olympic Stadium), and various flame retardant coatings. Other mineral mixtures {{that are used in}} similar fire retardant applications are natural mixtures of <b>huntite</b> and hydromagnesite.|$|E
50|$|Both {{calcium and}} {{magnesium}} go into solution when dolomite rock is dissolved. The speleothem precipitation sequence is: calcite, Mg-calcite, aragonite, <b>huntite</b> and hydromagnesite. Hence, {{the most common}} speleothem (secondary deposit) in caves within dolomite rock karst, is calcium carbonate in the most stable polymorph form of calcite. Speleothem types known to have a dolomite constituent include: coatings, crusts, moonmilk, flowstone, coralloids, powder, spar and rafts. Although {{there are reports of}} dolomite speleothems known to exist in a number of cave around the world, they are usually in relatively small quantities and form in very fine-grained deposits.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the largest}} {{deposits}} of hydromagnesite exists in Greece. [...] It consists of a natural mixture with <b>huntite.</b> Local people have used the white mineral {{as a source of}} material for whitewashing buildings for centuries. In the mid 20th century the minerals, ground to a fine powder, found use as a filler for rubber shoe soles. The locals used the granite mills designed for grinding wheat. Commercial exploitation of the minerals began in the late 70s and early 80s with the mineral being exported worldwide. The Greek deposit is still operated commercially, although the world’s largest commercially operated reserves are in Turkey.|$|E
5000|$|A mineral with {{exactly the}} same {{composition}} as that of <b>huntite</b> {{has been known for}} more than 200 years; in 1812 for example, John and in 1812 Stromeyer described it as having a chemical composition of CaCO3 : MgCO3 = 1 : 3 [...] In those days the mineral was known as conite (in German: Konit); a name given to it by Retzius (1798). However, a serious problem concerns the exact location where the mineral conite can be found. In 1798, Originally Retzius had found the new carbonate in a mineral collection, and had recognized it as a new species because it was harder than any of the known carbonates (even so hard, that it would spark when struck with steel) but no indication was given as to the site where theconite originally had been found.A number of papers describing conite are known, without the exact location where it caould be found. In 1804, Ludwig stated that the sample of conite studied by him, came [...] "from Iceland". In 1805 Leonhard wrote that the conite he had analyzed came [...] "from Scandinavia". Somewhat more exact was Stromeyer in 1812, who claimed that his sample of conite had been found near the village of Frankenhayn, on the eastern slope of the Hoher Meissner near Kassel, Germany. However, this conite had been found as a loose boulder, and no outcrop of the new mineral was mentioned. In 1833 Blum summed up how conite could be found in mines near Freiberg (Germany), as boulders on the slopes of Mount Meissner (Germany) and on Iceland. In 1849, Hirzel repeated that conite could be found on the eastern slope of Mount Meissner, [...] and in 1882 Schrauf reported the mineral from the magnesite deposits on the borders of the Schöninger Bach at Křemže near Budweis, Czech Republic. Because of the absence of a type locality for the mineral conite, historical priority of its description over that of <b>huntite</b> cannot be claimed.|$|E

40|$|The fire {{retardant}} effects of natural mixtures of <b>huntite</b> and hydromagnesite have been investigated. As {{well as being}} entirely natural these mixtures of minerals can be considered “greener” and more environmentally friendly, in their production methods, than alternatives such as aluminium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide. It {{has been shown that}} the release of water and carbon dioxide from hydromagnesite helps to increase the time to ignition and peak heat release in cone calorimeter testing. <b>Huntite</b> has been shown to decrease the average rate of heat release and increase the strength of the residue. Electron microscopy has shown that the <b>huntite</b> particles maintain their platy morphology during combustion in the cone calorimeter. The morphology of these particles helps to reduce the rate of heat release by slowing the release of flammable decomposition products to the flame. The platy shape of the <b>huntite</b> particles increases the strength of the residue containing higher proportions of this mineral. <b>Huntite</b> is shown to play an active part in improving fire retardancy when used in a mixture with hydromagnesite, giving performance for typical mixtures comparable to those of aluminium hydroxide...|$|E
40|$|Mixtures {{of the two}} {{minerals}} <b>huntite</b> and hydromagnesite {{have been}} successfully used as a fire retardant additive in polymers for many years. The onset of decomposition of hydromagnesite is at a higher temperature than that of aluminium hydroxide but {{lower than that of}} magnesium hydroxide, the two most commonly used mineral fire retardants. This makes it an ideal addition to the range of materials available to polymer compounders for improving fire retardant properties. In comparison to the better known mineral fire retardants there has been little published research on the fire retardant properties of <b>huntite</b> and hydromagnesite. What has been published has often been commercially orientated and the limited quantity of scientific literature does not fully explain the fire retardant mechanism of these blends of minerals, often dismissing <b>huntite</b> as having no useful fire retardant action other than diluting the solid phase fuel. Standard thermal analysis techniques (thermal gravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infra-red analysis) have been used to characterise the thermal decomposition of <b>huntite</b> and hydromagnesite from a source in Turkey. This has lead {{to an understanding of the}} decomposition mechanism of the minerals in terms of mass loss, enthalpy of decomposition, and evolved gases between room temperature and 1000 °C. Hydromagnesite endothermically decomposes between about 220 °C and 500 °C, initially releasing water followed by carbon dioxide. The rate of heating and partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere can influence the mechanism of carbon dioxide release. <b>Huntite</b> endothermically decomposes between about 450 °C and 800 °C releasing carbon dioxide in two stages. The use of the cone calorimeter to study the rate of heat release during combustion of ethylene vinyl acetate based polymer compounds has lead to an understanding of how both <b>huntite</b> and hydromagnesite affect the burning processes at different stages of the fire. By varying the ratio of the two minerals, hydromagnesite has been shown to increase the time to ignition and reduce the initial peak in rate of heat release, while <b>huntite</b> has been shown to reduce the rate of heat release later in the fire. It has been shown that <b>huntite</b> is far from being an inactive diluent filler. The endothermic decomposition of <b>huntite</b> in the later stages of the fire reduces the heat reaching underlying polymer and continues to dilute the flame with inert carbon dioxide. The platy <b>huntite</b> particles have been shown to align themselves in such a way that they can hinder the escape of volatiles from the decomposing polymer and also physically reinforce the inorganic ash residue...|$|E

40|$|The speleothems of Castañar Cave {{are made}} of a complex mineralogical {{association}} including aragonite, dolomite, <b>huntite,</b> hydromagnesite and {{a small proportion of}} Mg-rich clays whose mineralogy is difficult to determine. These clays appear as thin mats composed by fibres that are commonly associated to dolomite. The composition of cave waters and the textural relationship between the minerals indicate that in these alkaline environments there are several possible evaporation/concentration stages (with waters with pH > 8) followed by other stages characterized by freshwater entrances. All this result in complex precipitation sequences in which Ca and Mg are always available, and then it is silica content the main factor driving Mg-clay formation. The high Mg/Ca ratios drive initial aragonite precipitation, which contributes to an additional increase in this ratio enabling precipitation of <b>huntite</b> and Mg-clays (if silica is available).

40|$|The fire retardancy of {{carbonate}} minerals hydromagnesite. <b>huntite</b> {{and natural}} mixtures of hydromagnesite and <b>huntite,</b> on forest species was tested by analytical (differential thermogravimetry under air atmosphere) and laboratory-scale (flame spread test) methods.

On the basis of differential thermogravimetric analysis, minerals decrease forest species combustibility (by increasing maximum weight loss rate and combustion duration) and consumability (by increasing combustion mass residue) and increase their sustainability (by increasing combustion duration). Additionally, the flame spread tests indicate that the minerals decrease forest species ignitability (increase time for ignition) and combustibility (decrease flame spread rate, maximum flame height and mean flame intensity), and affect their sustainability (by increasing the flame duration) and consumability (by increasing the mass residue). Among minerals examined, the most efficient retardant was the mixture of <b>huntite</b> and hydromagnesite. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
30|$|As part of {{a dating}} study of rock art in the Victoria River District of the Northern Territory (lying between the Arnhem Land and Kimberley regions), the {{compositions}} of different paint colours have been determined using XRD [26]. The white pigments were found to consist mainly of <b>huntite,</b> gypsum and the oxalates whewellite and weddelite. The conversion, or not, of <b>huntite</b> into oxalates enables variation in mineral composition of pigment specimens to be identified.

Their SEM-EDX and XRD examinations revealed that the major mineral components of the pigments were <b>huntite,</b> whewellite, calcite and dolomite.
