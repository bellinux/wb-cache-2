50|$|Today, {{more than}} 900 bi- and {{multilateral}} environmental treaties are in force. Nonetheless, {{the most pressing}} problems of global change remain unresolved, some are even intensifying. The international <b>institutional</b> and <b>organisational</b> <b>architecture</b> has proven too weak to provide effective and efficient responses to these challenges. In this situation, the WBGU has developed a vision for reforming the United Nations in the environmental arena. It terms this the ‘Earth Alliance’, comprising three interlocking realms. First, to provide authority {{in the assessment of}} environmental problems, the WBGU proposes establishing an independent body whose task is to provide timely warning of particularly risk-laden developments in the sphere of global change - Earth Assessment. Second, the report gives recommendations for redesigning the organisational core of global environmental policy - Earth Organisation. This revolves around the step-wise establishment of an International Environmental Organisation, building on the existing United Nations Environment Programme as its initial nucleus. Third, the WBGU highlights new avenues for financing global environmental policy - Earth Funding.|$|R

40|$|Poor project {{performance}} creates a dilemma for managers {{in both the}} public and private sectors. Much research has been conducted on project success, but the relationship between <b>organisational</b> <b>architecture</b> and project success has not been fully explored. This led to the main research question of the study, which was: How can project success be better explained and understood from the perspective of <b>organisational</b> <b>architecture</b> theory? A literature review was conducted on the nature of projects, the project environment, and how project success can be defined and measured, including a discussion on success criteria and critical success factors. <b>Organisational</b> <b>architecture</b> was broken down into its core components. These components were further categorised into structural, operational or procedural, and behavioural (culture, motivation and leadership) components after which literature within each of these components were analysed and discussed. The study used a positivistic paradigm and collected quantitative data that was statistically analysed. An electronic questionnaire was successfully launched and distributed via an email link, which worked through the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University (NMMU) web survey system. This was done within the framework of built environment projects that are typically implemented through partnerships between the public and private sector. A satisfactory response rate was obtained from built environment professionals in South Africa to allow inference of the sample results to the population. The following hypotheses were tested in this study: H 1. 1 : The perception of South African built environment professionals {{is that there is a}} significant relationship between organisational structure and project success. H 1. 2 : The perception of South African built environment professionals is that there is a significant relationship between the use and application of traditional operations management tools and techniques and project success. H 1. 3 : The perception of South African built environment professionals is that there is a significant relationship between organisational culture and project success. H 1. 4 : The perception of South African built environment professionals is that there is a significant relationship between motivation and project success. H 1. 5 : The perception of South African built environment professionals is that there is a significant relationship between leadership and project success. An analysis of the survey results revealed that, according to South African built environment professionals, there is an overall significant relationship between <b>organisational</b> <b>architecture</b> and project success. Following an overview of the main findings, an <b>Organisational</b> <b>Architecture</b> – Project Success (OAPS) framework was presented as a recommendation of how to better explain and understand the relationship between <b>organisational</b> <b>architecture</b> and project success...|$|R

The first stage can be analysed with conventional rational choice based Europeanisation theories but these theories fall short in providing insight into the second stage. In this stage courts change their self-perception and role-perception leading to a change in their logic of appropriateness in their decision-making. Therefore, an approach synthesising aspects of sociological <b>institutional,</b> <b>organisational</b> theory and learning theories are best suited to account for this second stage.

40|$|Focusing {{mainly on}} {{industrial}} relations and work organisation within firms, {{the aim of}} this paper is to shed some light on the complex interrelations between different <b>institutional</b> and <b>organisational</b> levels in the East German transformation. On the theoretical level, this paper will attempt to adapt the path dependency criteria, developed by Arthur, to the institutional sphere and to accurately characterise notions such as rules or organisations, often used in a loose manner. On the empirical level, using quantitative and qualitative material (interviews in particular), this paper scrutinises <b>institutional</b> and <b>organisational</b> change, in order to elucidate some distinctive features of the emerging East German capitalism. East Germany was, and still is, involved in some elementary process common to other countries experiencing transformation (notably a deep <b>institutional</b> and <b>organisational</b> change and path-dependency effects) but with strongly marked specific features related to its absorption by the West German state.

40|$|The {{environmental}} governance of multinational corporations {{in developing countries}} is relatively understudied. Much of the existing work on the greening of industry focuses on one scale of governance (international, national or local), without adequately accounting for the socio-spatial complexities, either external or internal to the firm, which influence the take up and implementation of corporate environmentalism at the site level. My thesis explores how and why corporate environmentalism has evolved in three South African fuel oil refineries (two in Durban and one in Cape Town) between 1994 and 2006. <b>Institutional</b> and <b>organisational</b> theory, with insights from the literature on spatialities of corporate greening, informs this study. An analytical framework of multinational corporation complexity and organisational field dynamics is established to explore the process of <b>institutional</b> and <b>organisational</b> change. At the macro or organisational field level, actors compete to construct meanings of legitimate corporate environmental practice. Organisational fields are shaped by the interaction between institutional actors, institutional logics and governance structures. At the micro level, firm legitimation strategies and characteristics may explain how corporate greening differs. The research findings are triangulated using key informant interviews, document analysis and social network analysis. Punctuated by key events, bifurcated processes of <b>institutional</b> and <b>organisational</b> change are documented. In Durban changing normative and cognitive institutions drove the evolution of regulation: above all, an internationally networked civil society exercised discursive power by demanding environmental justice and corporate accountability from {{the private and public}} sectors. In Cape Town the organisational field remained fragmented as community-driven discursive strategies did not achieve significant governance outcomes and <b>institutional</b> and <b>organisational</b> change evolved more slowly. The company with the most significant home country and parent company pressure, Shell/Sapref, made the most gains in repairing its legitimacy and improving its environmental performance. In sum, corporate environmentalism in post-apartheid South Africa has been contested and constructed by processes of scalar and place-based politics...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} 25 -year {{transitional}} {{process of the}} Korean pharmaceutical industry from its initial focus on the imitative production of generic drugs {{to the development of}} new drugs. The catch-up dynamics of latecomer countries in science-intensive industries, such as the pharmaceutical industry, is an overlooked research topic in existing literature on innovation studies. This thesis provides an in-depth analysis of Korea’s science-intensive catch-up and applies an ‘exploration and exploitation’ framework to a latecomer setting and in a novel institutional and market context of the transitional phase. This thesis argues that the rate of change in the transition from imitating drugs to developing new drugs depends on the <b>institutional</b> and <b>organisational</b> mechanisms that enable a new form of technological learning, termed ‘exploratory learning’. This form of learning is often unfamiliar to firms in latecomer countries, whereas it is necessary for producing innovative drugs. That is, latecomers’ <b>institutional</b> and <b>organisational</b> promotion of exploratory learning is related to a ‘pattern change’ in the previously established <b>institutional</b> and <b>organisational</b> routines associated with imitative learning. The findings show that the rate of industrial transition in this sector was constrained by the problematic operation of S&T policies promoting key characteristics of exploratory learning, such as high-risk long-term learning as well as dense interactions between a diverse number of innovation actors. The findings also illuminate some latecomer firms’ initial difficulties in managing the new mode of technological learning, and in strategically applying that mode of learning to overcome the barriers to moving through the transitional phase towards producing competitive innovation. The thesis also suggests that the nature of drugs as integral products, deeply grounded in science, makes it difficult to effectively promote <b>institutional</b> and <b>organisational</b> transformations in favour of exploratory learning...|$|R
