30|$|<b>In</b> {{contrast}} to <b>the</b> local-scale comparison, at the finer level of compositional resolution {{there was considerable}} overlap <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mokihinui and Karamea lower gorges: {{five of the seven}} associations present occurred in both gorges (Table  2, Fig.  3 b).

All associations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mokihinui <b>lower</b> gorge occurred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Karamea <b>lower</b> gorge.
