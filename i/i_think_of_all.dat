500|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, George V became {{increasingly}} ill with lung problems, exacerbated by his heavy smoking. Queen Mary paid {{particular attention to}} his care. During his illness in 1928, one of his doctors, Sir Farquhar Buzzard, was asked who had saved the King's life. He replied, [...] "The Queen". In 1935, King George V and Queen Mary celebrated their silver jubilee, with celebrations taking place throughout the British Empire. In his jubilee speech, George paid public tribute to his wife, having told his speechwriter, [...] "Put that paragraph at the very end. I cannot trust myself {{to speak of the}} Queen when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> I owe her." ...|$|E
500|$|Sean Hayes {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Jack. When a NBC casting {{executive}} saw Hayes's role in the indie gay romance film Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss, he sent the script to Hayes, who was attending the 1997 Sundance Film Festival in Utah. Even though Hayes enjoyed the script when he read it, he threw it away as {{he did not want to}} spend money on a plane ticket to Los Angeles for the audition. However, a few weeks later when Hayes was in Los Angeles, he was sent the script again and decided to try out for the audition. If asked if he regrets accepting the role, Hayes said: [...] "If you're truly an actor, in the long run... I don't know that I would have done it either. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the things that I still want to do, and I don't know if I'll get to do them." [...] However, he admits that he [...] "love" [...] the idea that people assume that he is either gay or straight. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Hayes admitted that people believe he is Jack [...] "24 hours a day".|$|E
500|$|Much of Ianto's {{character}} development is centred on the character's relationship with Captain Jack. On the character's evolution from minor character to romantic interest, Gareth David-Lloyd has commented that [...] "To have a storyline where you're {{involved with the}} leading character for any actor is awesome." [...] On the character's development, David-Lloyd has said that through Jack's relationship, [...] "he's found his meaning and ... he's happier." [...] Asked {{what it is that}} Ianto receives from Jack, David-Lloyd responds [...] "Support, meaning. I think he lost meaning. He was tortured and Jack gave him that meaning back. And reliability that he'll always be there, I think." [...] John Barrowman and Gareth David-Lloyd have also opined that Jack's relationship with Ianto has however brought out Jack's empathy, and helped to ground him, with John Barrowman reported as saying that Ianto [...] "brings out the 'human' in him, it brings out more of the empathy because he's actually fallen for someone and he really cares about somebody. So, it's really great and I think that's what makes him warm to other people. It makes him more approachable." [...] In the same interview, Gareth David-Lloyd said of the relationship and his character that [...] "I think Ianto's always made him care and that is really the heart of the show. Ianto's always bearing his emotional side and vulnerable side and keeping his feet on the ground. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the characters, he's the one who tries to keep everyone else's feet on the ground. He brings everyone back to reality, often with a dry, witty remark or taking a dig at somebody just to sort of bring people back down." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cromwell led a Parliamentary {{invasion}} of Ireland from 164950. Parliament's key opposition was the military {{threat posed by}} the alliance of the Irish Confederate Catholics and English royalists (signed in 1649). The Confederate-Royalist alliance was judged {{to be the biggest}} single threat facing the Commonwealth. However, the political situation in Ireland in 1649 was extremely fractured: there were also separate forces of Irish Catholics who were opposed to the royalist alliance, and Protestant royalist forces that were gradually moving towards Parliament. Cromwell said {{in a speech to the}} army Council on 23 March that [...] "I had rather be overthrown by a Cavalierish interest than a Scotch interest; I had rather be overthrown by a Scotch interest than an Irish interest and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> this is the most dangerous".|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, W. Kordes' Sons, a German rose {{breeding}} company {{introduced the}} Mireille Mathieu Rose {{to match her}} favorite lipstick color. Mathieu also published her autobiography with co-author [...] The title is Oui Je Crois [...] "Yes, I Believe" [...] which is taken from the lyrics of Mon crédo, her first recording. The book {{was seen as a}} final chapter in her career. The French public had pretty much disowned her, as a conservative relic. She was considered a pre-revolution (1968) Gaullist figurehead, and hated by the left. Stark was also exhausted and overweight by this time. Pierre Delanoë wrote a passionate song about Joan of Arc in [...] for Mireille. The final lyric: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> I have given France... and she has forgotten me" [...] was truly how the singer felt as she was made a caricature by the Communists in power. She used her fists in punching the air while singing the song.|$|E

60|$|Did Mr. Horne {{write to}} you {{before he went to}} Australia? Did I speak to you about his going? Did you see the letter which he put into the papers as a {{farewell}} to England? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it <b>all</b> sadly.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right," [...] he beamed good-naturedly, [...] "and I'll {{tell you}} where to find him. But I tremble for you when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> you are to prove by Jackson's arm." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} what to say. When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> it <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> am lost in amazement. You tell me that you are not contented;--that you are ambitious for me. Why is it that you should feel any {{interest}} in the matter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> do. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>of</b> <b>all</b> men <b>I</b> am {{the most}} likely to feel what is due to the name of Lady Frances Trafford. Of course I never {{mentioned}} it to any one at the Post Office." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "They are a {{wonderful}} family, of course," [...] said Mrs. MacHugh; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> them {{she is the}} most wonderful. Old Barty said something to her at my house yesterday that wasn't intended to be kind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Kind to myself, my dear. It {{seems like}} a crime when I look at St. Matthew's; but when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> you <b>all,</b> and <b>of</b> home, I believe it is right {{that he should have}} the alternative. And now, if poor Lucy come, and it be not too late--' ...|$|R

60|$|So I {{think of}} myself, and so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> other human beings, as circles {{of thought and}} experience, each a little {{different}} from the others. Each human being I see as essentially a circle of thought between an internal and an external world.|$|E

6000|$|... "One {{must live}} somewhere, it is true," [...] she agreed, [...] "but why London? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>of</b> <b>all</b> great cities {{it is the}} most provincial.

6000|$|... "Good-morning, Mr. Cossey," [...] said Mr. Quest as he {{prepared}} to part with the deeds.
