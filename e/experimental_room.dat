The experimenter pointed out the four toys; before the child could play with the toys, the experimenter asked the child to sit in the chair and then demonstrated each toy briefly and in a friendly manner, saying that they would play with the toys later on. Then the experimenter placed each toy in the cardboard box and {{out of sight of the}} child. The experimenter explained to the child that the experimenter sometimes has to go out of the room but if the child eats a pretzel the experimenter will come back into the room. These instructions were repeated until the child seemed to understand them completely. The experimenter left the room and waited for the child to eat a pretzel - they did this four times.|$|E

While her PhD research under Houssay focused mainly on neuroendocrinology and cardiac control [...] - [...] her first article was on a method for permanent aortic cannulation in toads [...] - [...] soon she joined Miguel Rolando Covian {{in the field of}} neurophysiology. As most researchers under the guidance of Covian, Lico {{was interested}} {{in a wide variety of}} topics, and it has been said that her personal library [...] - [...] composed mainly of fiction and art books - attested this observation. Together with Venâncio Pereira Leite and Ricardo Francisco Marseillan, Lico spent most of her time manually producing electrodes, canulae and other equipment necessary for the implementation of novel techniques. As recorded by Anette Hoffmann:When I arrived at Ribeirão Preto in 1966, I had the opportunity to begin my scientific education participating in projects developed by Maria C. Lico and Miguel R. Covian. In those times, acute experiments, with anesthetized animals, were usual. The laboratory technician, Mr. Osvaldo Del Vecchio, a tailor by trade, performed surgeries with extreme competence. Maria C. Lico conducted experiments. Covian, who was the department head, was summoned to the <b>experimental</b> <b>room</b> only at the moments in which animals were subjected to the proposed experimental treatments. During intervals, which could take up to 30 minutes, Maria C. Lico dove in reading books [...] - [...] not on physiology, but fiction. By the time I met her, she read avidly the fiction from the Argentinian writer Julio Cortázar, and practically ignored my presence in the room. She was fascinated by the adventure of discovery. Her curiosity was endless. She would allow herself to wander through the pathways opened during a given experiment when she realized something new could be discovered, even though this could lead to deviating considerably from the original research line. She did not publish lavishly. Certainly she would be rejected by lack of productivity at the contemporary university.|$|E

As a consequence of the MASURCA favorable characteristics and diverse material inventories, the neutron beam intensity and spectrum can be further tailored to meet the users' needs, which could be of interest for several applications.

The {{purposes of this}} study are to perform NRA test experiments using the Micro Pixel Chamber (μPIC), developed by Kyoto University and to confirm the quantitative quality of the measurements of the system.

In the experiment, the transmission spectra with the samples and no sample were obtained. Background components were not so small in these measurements. From the neutron transport simulation, it was surmised that the origin of this background was due to scattering of neutrons in the <b>experimental</b> <b>room.</b> Therefore, the assumed background components were subtracted from the measurement data. Finally, {{it was found that the}} difference between the measurement data and the nuclear data was within about 20 %.

40|$|The main {{problems}} {{dealt with}} in this thesis are (1) how colours can appear in rooms due to various colour combinations and lighting conditions, and (2) how we can identify and compare colour appearance in rooms. One aim is to demonstrate and discuss the complex problem of how certain conditions in a room affect colour appearance, and to give examples and describe the co-operation between some of the affecting factors in <b>experimental</b> <b>rooms.</b> Another aim is to develop and evaluate methods for studying colours in rooms, methods that give us reliable visual identifications of perceived colour and allow comparisons between different rooms. Through an architectural perspective, tailored methods and specially developed concepts, the thesis presents a way to conceptualise and treat the complex subject of colour in enclosed spaces. The thesis work includes a literature survey and empirical studies. Most of the latter were made in <b>experimental</b> <b>rooms</b> in full and small scale, which were based on studies of actual interiors and preliminary model room studies. The literature survey mapped out the knowledge field, and the empirical studies worked out methods, tools and concepts {{for the study of}} colour appearance in rooms. Preliminary attempts are made to describe the elasticity in colour appearance of certain inherent colours under varying conditions in rooms. The phenomenon of reflections has been systematically studied, and discussed in relation to simultaneous contrast. The developed concepts of identity colour and colour variations have proved to be helpful tools for analysing colour appearance. The Visual Evaluation method of Liljefors and Ejhed was adjusted to involve visual assessments of the perceived colours. The colour reference box developed during the project is taken to solve a serious methodological problem, especially for comparisons between equally painted, but differently illuminated, rooms. The difficult problem of the adaptation effect was specially dealt with - that is, the colour sample in the colour reference box is perceived differently as the observer adapts to various lighting conditions. While complementary studies are needed, it was concluded that the adaptation effect for the hue is possible to map out and control...|$|R

The magnetic field created by permanent magnets in a closed magnetic circuit configuration permits the beam-profile reconstruction to be achieved with a good resolution.
