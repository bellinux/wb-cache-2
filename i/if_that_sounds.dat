If a tree exists outside of perception then there is no way for us to know that the tree exists. So then, what do we mean by existence, what is {{the difference}} between perception and reality? Also, people may also say, if the tree exists outside of perception (as common sense would dictate), then it will produce sound waves. However, these sound waves will not actually sound like anything. Sound as it is mechanically understood will occur, but sound as it is understood by sensation will not occur.

5|$|Studies {{conducted}} off the Florida {{coast and}} the Bahamas {{have shown that}} silky sharks are highly sensitive to sound, in particular low-frequency (10–20Hz), irregular pulses. Experiments in which these sounds were played underwater attracted sharks from hundreds of meters away. Silky sharks likely orient to these sounds because they {{are similar to the}} noise generated by feeding animals such as birds or dolphins, thus indicating promising sources of food. These studies have also demonstrated that a silky shark attracted by one sound will quickly withdraw <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> abruptly changes in amplitude or character; this change need not be a sound produced by a predator to evoke the reaction. Over repeated exposures, silky sharks habituate to the sound change and stop withdrawing, though it takes them much longer to do so compared to the bolder oceanic whitetip shark.|$|R

5000|$|In No Depression, Douglas Heselgrave said, [...] "The {{music itself}} is fabulous, {{compelling}} and complex. It {{was during the}} Dead's 2009 tour, that Hart first became fascinated with sounds and images of the cosmos he'd accessed from NASA, {{and he began to}} incorporate some of them into the 'drums' segment of the show. This album is an extension of that interest with Hart using 'the billion year old orchestra of planetary motion' as a kind of reference or backbeat that grounds each of the songs on Mysterium Tremendum. <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> too far out, don't worry. Every composition on the album flows together to form a seamless journey that never loses its groove or momentum. The combination of cosmic sounds, electronic and hand percussions, and conventional rock instruments are interwoven to create a sonic ambiance that is completely contemporary and enveloping. But, those hoping for a New Age soundtrack will be sorely disappointed; this is hard and driving music blessed with a melodic sensibility that is far more front and center than we've heard from Mickey in some time." ...|$|E

[...] Richard Corliss of Time magazine also gave the film a positive review, writing that [...] "small in stature but consistently entertaining, Seven Psychopaths is a vacation from consequence for the Tony- and Oscar-winning author, and an unsupervised play date for his cast of screw-loose stars." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, stating: [...] "On balance, one could argue that Seven Psychopaths warrants a better rating than a mediocre **1/2, but the aftertaste is so bitter that it diminishes the sweetness that started off the meal." ...|$|E

60|$|At that time, {{and for a}} {{good many}} weeks after that time, Richard was {{constant}} in his visits.
