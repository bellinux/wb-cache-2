5|$|After a {{long period}} of {{remaining}} <b>empty,</b> <b>the</b> castle slowly began to decay, until in 1812, when Simon Temple, a local businessman, leased the castle from the Strathmores and made it habitable. He re-roofed the chapel (allowing it to be used for public worship again), added battlements to the wings and cultivated the gardens. However, his failed business ventures prevented him from completing his work, and in 1819 the castle was lived in by a Mr. Thomas Wade.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{was then}} {{elected to the}} state Senate and served from 1832 to 1835. He {{was a member of}} the Committee for Internal Improvements. Upon the death of Governor John Breathitt in 1834, Lieutenant Governor James Turner Morehead was {{elevated}} to governor. The office of lieutenant governor then being <b>empty,</b> <b>the</b> Senate had no presiding officer. In 1835, Clark was elected Speaker of the Senate, and presided in Morehead's absence.|$|E

25|$|In set theory, 0 is the {{cardinality}} of <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> set: if {{one does}} not have any apples, then one has 0 apples. In fact, in certain axiomatic developments of mathematics from set theory, 0 is defined to be <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> set. When this is done, <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> set is <b>the</b> Von Neumann cardinal assignment for a set with no elements, which is <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> set. <b>The</b> cardinality function, applied to <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> set, returns <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> set as a value, thereby assigning it 0 elements.|$|R

Nonetheless, hundreds of thousands of asteroids are currently known, and the total number ranges in the millions or more, depending on the lower size cutoff. Over 200 asteroids are known to be larger than 100km, and a survey in the infrared wavelengths has shown that {{the asteroid belt}} has 0.7–1.7 million asteroids with a diameter of 1km or more. The apparent magnitudes of most of the known asteroids are 11–19, with the median at about 16.|$|E
5|$|In {{computer}} science, binary search, {{also known}} as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds {{the position of a}} target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half until it is successful. If the search ends with the remaining half being <b>empty,</b> <b>the</b> target is not in the array.|$|E

5|$|The {{legends of}} self-wounding and the {{provision}} of blood may have arisen because of the impression a pelican sometimes gives that it is stabbing itself with its bill.

5|$|At 0530 {{elements}} of the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division with tank support, launched a new assault to capture the village of Grainville-sur-Odon. After shelling and close quarter street fighting, the Scots secured the village by 1300 hours; German counter-attacks followed but were repulsed. At 0600 the Germans began two strong flanking attacks, {{with the intention of}} pinching out the British salient. Kampfgruppe Frey on the eastern flank, launched an attack north of the Odon, supported by Panzer IVs of the 21st Panzer Division. This reached the villages of Mouen and Tourville but the British counter-attacked from the direction of Cheux, resulting in confused heavy fighting throughout the day. Frey's battle group managed to gain control of Mouen and British counter-attacks supported by tanks halted any further advance but were unable to retake the village. British patrols found Marcelet partly <b>empty,</b> <b>the</b> German front line having been pulled back towards Carpiquet.|$|E

5|$|During the Mexican oil boom, Air France flew Concorde twice weekly to Mexico City's Benito Juárez International Airport via Washington, DC, or New York City, from September 1978 to November 1982. The {{worldwide}} {{economic crisis}} {{during that period}} resulted in this route's cancellation; the last flights were almost <b>empty.</b> <b>The</b> routing between Washington or New York and Mexico City included a deceleration, from Mach 2.02 to Mach 0.95, to cross Florida subsonically and avoid creating a sonic boom over the state; Concorde then re-accelerated back to high speed while crossing the Gulf of Mexico. On 1 April 1989, on an around-the-world luxury tour charter, British Airways implemented changes to this routing that allowed G-BOAF to maintain Mach 2.02 by passing around Florida {{to the east and}} south. Periodically Concorde visited the region on similar chartered flights to Mexico City and Acapulco.|$|E
5|$|Mario's health {{consists}} of a three-piece health meter, which is depleted through contact with enemies and hazards. When swimming underwater, Mario has an air supply meter, which quickly depletes his main health meter if it runs out. Mario's health and air supply can be restored by collecting coins, or through touching bubbles if underwater. When the health meter becomes <b>empty,</b> <b>the</b> player loses a life and must {{go back to a}} predetermined checkpoint. The health meter can be temporarily expanded to six units {{through the use of a}} Life Mushroom, with the maximum health returning to three units if the overall health falls to three units from enemy or hazard contact, or if Mario suffers instant death. Instant death can occur by being swallowed by quicksand or dark matter; falling into bottomless pits, which either consist of black holes or by leaving a planet's gravitational pull and falling into space. The player can obtain extra lives by collecting 1-Up Mushrooms, 50 coins without losing a life, or 50 Star Bits.|$|E
