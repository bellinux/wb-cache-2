25|$|The {{first step}} of {{gastrulation}} is the <b>epithelial-to-mesenchymal</b> <b>transition</b> and ingression of primary mesenchyme cells into the blastocoel. Primary mesenchyme cells, or PMCs, {{are located in the}} vegetal plate specified to become mesoderm. Prior to ingression, PMCs exhibit all the features of other epithelial cells that comprise the embryo. Cells of the epithelium are bound basally to a laminal matrix and apically to an extraembryonic matrix. The apical microvilli of these cells reach into the hyaline layer, a component of the extraembryonic matrix. Neighboring epithelial cells are also connected to each other through apical junctions, protein complexes containing adhesion molecules, such as cadherins, linked to catenins.|$|E
25|$|As PMCs {{begin to}} undergo an <b>epithelial-to-mesenchymal</b> <b>transition,</b> the lamina which binds them dissolves {{to begin the}} {{mechanical}} release of the cells. Expression of the membrane protein that binds laminin, integrin, also becomes irregular {{at the beginning of}} ingression. The microvilli which secure PMCs to the hyaline layer shorten, as the cells reduce their affinity for the extraembryonic matrix. These cells concurrently increase their affinity for other components of the basal matrix, such as fibronectin, in part driving the movement of cells inward. The apical junctions which bind PMCs to their neighboring epithelial cells become disrupted during this transition, and are absent in cells that have fully ingressed into the blastocoel. Because staining for cadherins and catenins in ingressing cells decreases and develops as intracellular accumulations, apical junctions are thought to be cleared by endocytosis during ingression.|$|E

40|$|The {{genesis of}} {{carcinoma}} cells often involves <b>epithelial-to-mesenchymal</b> <b>transitions</b> and {{the acquisition of}} apoptosis resistance, but {{it is unclear whether}} these alterations are controlled coordinately or independently. Our previously reported effects of adenovirus E 1 a in human tumor cells raised the possibility that the E 1 a-interacting corepressor protein C-terminal-binding protein (CtBP) might selectively repress epithelial cell adhesion and proapoptotic genes. Here, we report that CtBP-knockout cells were hypersensitive to apoptosis. Correspondingly, microarray analysis of CtBP-knockout vs. CtBP-rescued mouse embryo fibroblasts revealed that many epithelial-specific and proapoptotic genes were indeed regulated by CtBP. Neither the apoptosis nor the repression activities of CtBP required histidine- 315, suggesting that the proposed dehydrogenase activity is not essential for CtBP function. The results presented herein establish two functional roles of CtBP: to corepress epithelial genes, thus permitting <b>epithelial-to-mesenchymal</b> <b>transitions,</b> and to modulate the cellular threshold for apoptotic responses...|$|R

Using in vivo inducible transgenes that can sense or modify Rac activity, we demonstrate an apicobasal gradient of Rac activity that is required to correctly form and position distinct classes of dynamic protrusion along the apicobasal axis of the cell. We show that we can modify the Rac activity gradient in genetic mutants for specific polarity proteins, with consequent changes in protrusion form and position and additionally show, using photoactivatable Rac transgenes, that it is the level of Rac activity that determines protrusion form. Thus, we demonstrate a mechanism by which polarity proteins can spatially regulate Rac activity and the actin cytoskeleton to ensure correct epithelial cell shape and prevent <b>epithelial-to-mesenchymal</b> <b>transitions...</b>|$|R

Both require the efficient generation of large quantities of clinical-grade stem cells that are free from harmful genomic alterations. The currently employed colony-type culture methods often result in low cell yields, unavoidably heterogeneous cell populations, and substantial chromosomal abnormalities. Here, we {{shed light on the}} structural relationship between hPSC colonies/embryoid bodies and early-stage embryos in order to optimize current culture methods based on the insights from developmental biology. We further highlight core signaling pathways that underlie multiple <b>epithelial-to-mesenchymal</b> <b>transitions</b> (EMTs), cellular heterogeneity, and chromosomal instability in hPSCs. We also analyze emerging methods such as non-colony type monolayer (NCM) and suspension culture, which provide alternative growth models for hPSC expansion and differentiation. Furthermore, based on the influence of cell–cell interactions and signaling pathways, we propose concepts, strategies, and solutions for production of clinical-grade hPSCs, stem cell precursors, and miniorganoids, which are pivotal steps needed for future clinical applications...|$|R

All IF proteins are expressed in a highly developmentally-regulated fashion; vimentin is the major cytoskeletal component of mesenchymal cells. Because of this, vimentin is often used as a marker of mesenchymally-derived cells or cells undergoing an <b>epithelial-to-mesenchymal</b> <b>transition</b> (EMT) during both normal development and metastatic progression.|$|E
40|$|SummaryInitiation of motile cell {{behavior}} in embryonic development occurs during late blastula stages when gastrulation begins. At this stage, the strong adhesion of blastomeres {{has to be}} modulated to enable dynamic behavior, similar to <b>epithelial-to-mesenchymal</b> <b>transitions.</b> We show that, in zebrafish maternal and zygotic (MZ) spg embryos mutant for the stem cell transcription factor Pou 5 f 1 /Oct 4, which are severely delayed in the epiboly gastrulation movement, all blastomeres are defective in E-cadherin (E-cad) endosomal trafficking, and E-cad accumulates at the plasma membrane. We find that Pou 5 f 1 -dependent control of EGF expression regulates endosomal E-cad trafficking. EGF receptor may act via modulation of p 120 activity. Loss of E-cad dynamics reduces cohesion of cells in reaggregation assays. Quantitative analysis of cell {{behavior in}}dicates that dynamic E-cad endosomal trafficking is required for epiboly cell movements. We hypothesize that dynamic control of E-cad trafficking is essential to effectively generate new adhesion sites when cells move relative to each other...|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} years many {{articles}} have reported <b>epithelial-to-mesenchymal</b> <b>transitions</b> (EMT) induced by a myriad of gene products either when added to the cell medium or when transfected. Molecularly the EMT {{is characterized by the}} up-regulation of transcriptional factors (EMT-TFs) repressing the epithelial gene E-cadherin, a protein essential for the maintenance of the epithelial phenotype. These EMT-TFs are subjected to a complex regulation involving binary self-stimulatory loops, allowing the possibility of the amplification of input signals. The capability of EMT-TFs to promote an EMT is controlled by E-cadherin that limits the transcription of mesenchymal genes. We discuss here the differences between normal and tumor epithelial cells; in the latter a partial inactivation of E-cadherin function enables extracellular signals to be amplified and induce an EMT. This tumor cell phenotypic instability is exacerbated in cell culture conditions. Therefore, it is likely that many of the gene products reported to control this transition act only in very specific cell tumor cell lines; thus, in cells with an unstable phenotype due to pre-existing alterations in E-cadherin safeguard mechanism...|$|R

40|$|Mast cells {{regulate}} both inflammatory {{responses and}} tissue repair in human diseases {{but there are}} conflicting reports {{on the role of}} these cells in the pathogenesis of various kidney diseases. Here we measured mast cell function in unilateral ureteral obstruction, a well-characterized model of renal fibrosis, using KitW/KitW−v mice genetically deficient in mast cells, wild-type mice, and deficient mice reconstituted by adoptive transfer with mast cells from the wild-type animals. Mast cell-deficient mice had higher levels of renal tubular damage, more stromal fibrosis, higher numbers of infiltrating ERHR 3 -positive macrophages and CD 3 -positive T cells, and higher tissue levels of profibrotic transforming growth factor-β 1 than wild-type mice or mice reconstituted by adoptive transfer of mast cells 3 weeks after ureteral obstruction. Similarly, while wild-type and adoptively transferred mice had increased α-smooth muscle actin and decreased E-cadherin expression, which are indicators of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, the obstructed kidneys of the mast cell–deficient mice had significant attenuation of those indicators. Thus, our study suggests that mast cells protect the kidney against fibrosis by modulation of inflammatory cell infiltration and by transforming growth factor-β 1 -driven <b>epithelial-to-mesenchymal</b> <b>transitions...</b>|$|R
40|$|Despite its benefits, the {{clinical}} use of cyclosporine A (CsA) {{is limited by}} its nephrotoxic properties. Because paricalcitol (19 -nor- 1, 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 2) has renoprotective effects, we tested whether it can blunt renal dysfunction and fibrosis in a rat model of CsA-induced nephropathy. Treatment with CsA decreased creatinine clearance, increased monocyte/macrophage infiltration, and increased the expression of inflammatory cytokines within the kidney. Paricalcitol reduced the decline in kidney function and pro-fibrotic changes and also blunted the increased transforming growth factor (TGF) -β 1 expression and Smad signaling. Using an in vitro model, we treated HK- 2 cells with CsA and found that paricalcitol attenuated the CsA-induced increases in phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated and c-Jun N-terminal kinases, and also prevented the activation of nuclear factor-κB. Paricalcitol effectively prevented TGF-β 1 -induced <b>epithelial-to-mesenchymal</b> <b>transitions</b> and extracellular matrix accumulation as evidenced by attenuated collagen deposition and fibrosis in CsA-treated rats. In addition, paricalcitol decreased the number of TUNEL-positive nuclei and reduced the expression of pro-apoptotic markers in CsA-treated HK- 2 cells. Thus, paricalcitol appears to attenuate CsA-induced nephropathy by suppression of inflammatory, pro-fibrotic, and apoptotic factors through inhibition of the nuclear factor-κB, Smad, and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways...|$|R

Consistent with this hypothesis, PrP transcription increased more than tenfold during EMT, and stable PrP-deficient cells failed to complete EMT in a mammalian cell model. A global comparative proteomics analysis identified the neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM 1) as a candidate mediator of this impairment, which led to the observation that PrP-deficient cells fail to undergo NCAM 1 polysialylation during EMT. Surprisingly, this defect was caused by a perturbed transcription of the polysialyltransferase ST 8 SIA 2 gene. Proteomics data pointed toward β-catenin as a transcriptional regulator affected in PrP-deficient cells. Indeed, pharmacological blockade or siRNA-based knockdown of β-catenin mimicked PrP-deficiency in regards to NCAM 1 polysialylation.

Occludin is also down-regulated in premalignant foci in kidneys from patients with germline VHL mutations, consistent with a contribution to CCRCC initiation. Reexpression of E-cadherin was sufficient to restore AJ but not TJ assembly, indicating that the TJ defect is independent of E-cadherin down-regulation. Additional experiments show that activation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) contributes to both TJ and AJ abnormalities, thus the VHL/HIF pathway contributes to multiple aspects of the EMT phenotype that are not interdependent.

The disintegration of cell adhesion molecules is closely related to this process. This study investigated the role of tumor budding in the progression of CRC, and compared the expression of b-catenin and E-cadherin between tumor budding and tumor center to deter-mine whether <b>epithelial-to-mesenchymal</b> <b>transitions</b> (EMTs) occur in tumor budding. Methods: The number of tumor budding (NTB) instances was determined in 58 cases of CRC, and im-munoreactivities of E-cadherin and b-catenin were compared at the tumor center and at the tumor budding site. Immunohistochemical staining for vimentin was also done. Results: Tumor budding was seen in 52 tumors (90 %). There were significant associations between NTB and cliniopathologic parameters such as tumor depth, nodal metastasis and clinical stage. Expres-sion of cytoplasmic and nuclear b-catenin were significantly higher at tumor budding sites than in the tumor center. In contrast, expression of membranous and cytoplasmic E-cadherin were significantly higher in the tumor center than at the tumor budding sites. Vimentin was expressed at tumor budding foci of only 2 cases (3 %). Conclusions: This study suggests that EMT occurs at tumor budding, and that NTB may be a good marker for predicting a poor prognosis in CRC...|$|R

To characterize signaling pathways cells use to coordinate these changes, we used NMuMG mammary epithelial cells. We showed that these cells become fibroblastic and scattered, with increased N-cadherin expression when cultured on collagen I. Rac 1 and c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK) were activated when cells were plated on collagen I, and dominant inhibitory Rac 1 (RacN 17) or inhibition of JNK signaling prevented collagen I–induced morphological changes and N-cadherin up-regulation. Furthermore, inhibiting phosphoinositide- 3 kinase (PI 3 K) activity prevented Rac 1 and JNK activation as well as collagen I–induced N-cadherin up-regulation. These data implicate PI 3 K–Rac 1 –JNK signaling in collagen I–induced changes in NMuMG cells. To establish a role for N-cadherin in collagen I–induced cell scattering, we generated N-cadherin overexpressing and knockdown NMuMG cells and showed that knocking down N-cadherin expression prevented collagen I–induced morphological changes. Motility assays showed that cells overexpressing N-cadherin were significantly more motile than mock-transfected cells and that N-cadherin-mediated motility was collagen I dependent.

40|$|Vitamin E is {{composed}} of two structurally similar compounds: tocopherols (TPs) and tocotrienols (T 3). Despite being overshadowed by TP {{over the past few}} decades, T 3 is now considered to be a promising anticancer agent due to its potent effects against a wide range of cancers. A growing body of evidence suggests that in addition to its antioxidative and pro-apoptotic functions, T 3 possesses a number of anticancer properties that make it superior to TP. These include the inhibition of <b>epithelial-to-mesenchymal</b> <b>transitions,</b> the suppression of vascular endothelial growth factor tumor angiogenic pathway and the induction of antitumor immunity. More recently, T 3, but not TP, has been shown to have chemosensitization and anti-cancer stem cell effects, further demonstrating the potential of T 3 as an effective anticancer therapeutic agent. With most of the previous clinical studies on TP producing disappointing results, research has now focused on testing T 3 as the next generation vitamin E for chemoprevention and cancer treatment. This review will summarize recent developments in the understanding of the anticancer effects of T 3.
