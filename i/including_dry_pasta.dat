40|$|International audienceWe present {{experiments}} on the dynamic buckling and fragmentation of slender rods axially impacted by a projectile. By combining {{the results of}} Saint-Venant and elastic beam theory, we derive a preferred wavelength lambda for the buckling instability, and experimentally verify the resulting scaling law {{for a range of}} materials <b>including</b> teflon, <b>dry</b> <b>pasta,</b> glass, and steel. For brittle materials, buckling leads to the fragmentation of the rod. Measured fragment length distributions show two peaks near lambda/ 2 and lambda/ 4.

2500|$|<b>Dried</b> <b>pasta</b> {{can also}} be defined as factory-made pasta because it is usually {{produced}} in large amounts that require large machines with superior processing capabilities to manufacture. <b>Dried</b> <b>pasta</b> is mainly shipped over to farther locations and has a longer shelf life. The ingredients required to make <b>dried</b> <b>pasta</b> <b>include</b> semolina flour and water. Eggs can be added for flavour and richness, but are not needed to make <b>dried</b> <b>pasta.</b> In contrast to fresh <b>pasta,</b> <b>dried</b> <b>pasta</b> needs to be dried at a low temperature for several days to evaporate all the moisture allowing it to be stored for a longer period. <b>Dried</b> <b>pastas</b> are best served in hearty dishes like ragu sauces, soups, and casseroles. Once it is cooked, the <b>dried</b> <b>pasta</b> will usually increase in size by double of its original proportion.

5000|$|<b>Dry</b> <b>pasta</b> {{lines are}} {{machines}} that make <b>dry</b> <b>pasta</b> {{products such as}} spaghetti or penne.

25|$|Pasta {{exhibits}} a random molecular order {{rather than a}} crystalline structure. The moisture content of <b>dried</b> <b>pasta</b> is typically around 12%, indicating that <b>dried</b> <b>pasta</b> will remain a brittle solid until it is cooked and becomes malleable.

50|$|Pasta is {{categorized}} in {{two basic}} styles: dried and fresh. <b>Dried</b> <b>pasta</b> made without eggs {{can be stored}} {{for up to two}} years under ideal conditions, while fresh pasta will keep {{for a couple of days}} in the refrigerator. Pasta is generally cooked by boiling. Under Italian law, <b>dry</b> <b>pasta</b> (pasta secca) can only be made from durum wheat flour or durum wheat semolina, and is more commonly used in Southern Italy compared to their Northern counterparts, who traditionally prefer the fresh egg variety.|$|R

Since <b>dry</b> <b>pasta</b> market is saturated and has few opportunities for innovation, product differentiation takes place through the adoption of particular varieties of grains (e.g., traditional, local) and/or specific schemes of certified quality (e.g., organic).
