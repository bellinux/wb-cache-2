5|$|Sabina {{ran out of}} {{the house}} with a hammer, {{periodically}} hitting herself over the head with it. A passing motorist, Joshua Grattage, saw this extraordinary behaviour and decided to tackle her in an attempt {{to take control of the}} hammer. While wrestling with Grattage, Sabina took a roof tile out of <b>her</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> struck him on the back of the head with it, stunning him temporarily.|$|E
5|$|The {{damaging}} {{effects of}} ionising radiation were not {{known at the}} time of her work, which had been carried out without the safety measures later developed. She had carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in <b>her</b> <b>pocket,</b> <b>and</b> she stored them in her desk drawer, remarking on the faint light that the substances gave off in the dark. Curie was also exposed to X-rays from unshielded equipment while serving as a radiologist in field hospitals during the war. Although her many decades of exposure to radiation caused chronic illnesses (including near-blindness due to cataracts) and ultimately her death, she never really acknowledged the health risks of radiation exposure.|$|E
5|$|After Katja is shot, Sarah flees in Beth's car and {{receives}} {{a call from}} a woman on Beth's phone.

While burying Katja's body, Sarah finds a hotel key in <b>her</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> keeps it. She visits her foster brother Felix's apartment and discovers that the $75,000 she stole from Beth's bank account has been taken by Beth's detective partner Art. When she returns to Beth's apartment she is surprised to find Beth's boyfriend, Paul, who seems confused by Sarah's demeanour but does not realise that she is not Beth. The next day, Sarah prepares to meet Art, and lies that the $75,000 belongs to Paul, but Art says he will return the money only after the hearing Beth must attend about a suspicious shooting in which she was involved.|$|E

5|$|Inside the elevator, Henry asks Archie why {{he refuses}} {{to believe that he}} is Jiminy Cricket. Archie {{acknowledges}} that he might share Jiminy's personality and in a similar fashion to his alternative past, yearn to be free from being told what to do. Meanwhile, above ground, Emma finds the opening of the elevator shaft and volunteers to go down the shaft, where she succeeds in rescuing Henry and Archie. Archie tells Regina that he will continue to see Henry and that if she attempts to interfere he will take action against Regina and have her declared an unfit mother. Regina backs down after Archie's threat, she looks at the object she had in <b>her</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> throws it down the shaft, where it lands on top of the rest of Snow White's (Ginnifer Goodwin) glass coffin.|$|E

6000|$|I saw the indignation {{rising in}} the old woman's face. She was insulted. This boy was making fun of her. That was her thought. She thrust her hands into <b>her</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>and</b> {{straightened}} up {{to give him a}} piece of her mind. Her temper was all up, and hot. Her mouth came open and let out three words of a bitter sentence,... then it fell silent, and the anger in her face turned to surprise or wonder or fear, or something, and she slowly brought out her hands from <b>her</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>and</b> opened them and held them so. In one was my piece of money, in the other lay four silver groschen. She gazed a little while, perhaps to see if the groschen would vanish away; then she said, fervently: ...|$|R

50|$|In the {{presence}} of Helen Romero, an administrative assistant, Mr. Wilson requested Marissa turn out <b>her</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>and</b> open <b>her</b> wallet. Marissa produced a blue pill, several white ones, and a razor blade. Marissa identified Savana Redding {{as the person who}} had supplied her with the drugs.

6000|$|... 'I think,' said Mrs. Britain, {{applying}} {{herself to}} <b>her</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>and</b> drawing forth an immense bulk of thin books and crumpled papers: a very kennel of dogs'-ears: 'I've done everything.

"I winna {{be called}} the deceased," [...] cried Agnes hotly, {{but she had to}} do as she was bid, and when she emerged, from behind the tree she was the very image of the ill-fated Gavinia. Stroke showed her a plan of Miss Ailie's backdoor, and also gave her a kitchen key (when he {{produced}} this, she felt in <b>her</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>and</b> then snatched it from him), after which she set out for the Dovecot in a scare about her own identity.|$|R
60|$|She {{took out}} the torn {{handkerchief}} from <b>her</b> <b>pocket</b> again, <b>and</b> wrapped it deliberately round the necklace. Mrs. Davilow observed the action with some surprise, but the tone of her last words discouraged her from asking any question.|$|R
