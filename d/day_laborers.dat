5|$|The {{far left}} wing, under Anton Sztáray, Michael von Fröhlich and Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé, guarded the Rhine border from Mannheim to Switzerland. This {{part of the}} army {{included}} the conscripts drafted from the imperial circles. Charles {{did not like to}} use the militias in any vital location and once it seemed clear to him that the French intended to cross at the middle Rhine, the Archduke felt no qualms placing his militia men at Kehl. In Spring 1796, when resumption of war appeared eminent, the 88-members of the Swabian Circle, which included most of the states (ecclesiastical, secular, and dynastic) in Upper Swabia, had raised a small force of about 7,000 men. These were field hands, the occasional journeyman, and <b>day</b> <b>laborers</b> drafted for service, but untrained in military matters. The remainder of the force included experienced troops from the Habsburg frontier troops stationed just north of Rastatt and a cadre of French royalists and a couple hundred mercenaries at Freiburg im Breisgau.|$|E

Most {{returned to}} France {{as soon as}} possible, hoping to avoid the dreaded yellow fever, which regularly swept the colony. The lower-class whites, petits blancs, included artisans, shopkeepers, slave dealers, overseers, and <b>day</b> <b>laborers.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1758, {{the white}} landowners began passing {{legislation}} restricting {{the rights of}} other groups of people until a rigid caste system was defined.

25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, <b>day</b> <b>laborers</b> in the New York docks worked {{depending}} {{on the availability of}} ships to unload, and thus when not working they often stood nearby, waiting for news that there was work. This subject of men at the New York docks was a common one for Bellows, as well as fellow Ashcan painters such as Everett Shinn. Men of the Docks is the largest example of Bellows' treatment of the subject.|$|E

The yearly rent was one symbolic guilder, though additionally requested were three daily prayers in the name of Fugger and his family.|$|E

25|$|New Hampshire {{was one of}} the {{thirteen}} colonies that rebelled against British rule during the American Revolution. By the time of the American Revolution, New Hampshire was a divided province.

Wealthy merchants built substantial homes, furnished them with the finest luxuries, and invested their capital in trade and land speculation. At {{the other end of the}} social scale, there developed a permanent class of <b>day</b> <b>laborers,</b> mariners, indentured servants and even slaves.|$|E

Many Brazilians worked in skilled trades such as tile and flooring, although fewer worked as <b>day</b> <b>laborers</b> than did Latinos. Many had moved from Brazilian communities in the Northeastern United States, Florida and Georgia. Brazilians settled throughout the metropolitan area. Most were undocumented. In January 2008 the New Orleans Brazilian population had a mid-range estimate of 3,000. By 2008 Brazilians had opened many small churches, shops and restaurants catering to their community.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{creation}} of a Romanian Principality, Ursari nonetheless remained a presence associated with busking and fairs, especially with those held in Bucharest and provincial cities such as Bacău. As early as the rule of Domnitor Alexandru Ioan Cuza, they formed a staple of such spectacles, alongside the music-playing Lăutari, the Căluşari, and freak shows. At around the same time, they included a section of zavragii, smiths who worked as <b>day</b> <b>laborers.</b> Also during the late 19th century, the Ursari came to be attested in Imperial Russian-ruled Bessarabia, where the local population referred to them and to the lăieşi in general as şătraşi ("people living on campsites").|$|E
25|$|The shura {{began to}} falter by October 2008.

On October 28, {{the commander of}} COP Keating, Captain Robert J. Yllescas, was severely wounded in a targeted assassination attempt with a remotely detonated IED less than 400 meters from the outpost—he later died from his wounds. The assassin was later found in Urmul and appeared to have the assistance {{of one of the}} Afghan <b>day</b> <b>laborers</b> at Camp Keating and the acquiescence of Urmul's elders. Yllescas's charismatic relations with the Shura had supported the transition from 1-91 Cavalry to 6th Squadron, and the Shura's influence and collaboration with ISAF forces declined from this point.|$|E

25|$|In late July 1586, the Duke of Parma {{surrounded}} Neuss {{with over}} 8,000 Italian and Spanish {{troops of the}} Army of Flanders, and another 2,000 men {{under the command of}} Karl von Mansfeld. They grossly outnumbered the defenders of the city, reported variously as 1,600 or 1,800, including largely farmers, citizens, shepherds, clerics, teachers, journeymen, <b>day</b> <b>laborers,</b> and various craftsmen. Prior to a punishing cannonade, the Duke offered terms, which Cloedt declined. The city, he claimed, had no authority to treat with him, as the city's rights and protection came from the Holy Roman Emperor himself. As the herald left, the journeymen hurled insults at him and the Duke of Parma. At the assault of the Rhine Gate, over 400 men were killed, and Cloedt was gravely injured. In short order, the fortifications were overrun, and 10,000 Spanish, Italian and Germans entered the city, intent on plunder and whatever else they could find. Cloedt was found in the abbey {{in the center of the}} town, and hanged from the window with six of his commanders.|$|E
500|$|Leggett {{dealt with}} the major local issue of a hiring site for <b>day</b> <b>laborers</b> {{from the city of}} Gaithersburg and the {{surrounding}} upcounty area. During the term of Leggett's predecessor Doug Duncan, Gaithersburg had struggled to find space within the city limits that the county could lease for use as a location where the <b>day</b> <b>laborers</b> could wait for employers. The owners of virtually all of the more than 30 sites considered by the city government had refused to grant a lease for this purpose, and in the one case where the property owner was willing to consider the use, the county's efforts to lease the property fell through after the property owner backed out. The debate became caught up in a larger national debate about the role of illegal immigrants in American society. Leggett located a site for day laborer center on county-owned land with his first several months in office. [...] Despite opposition from anti-immigrant voices, the Center has served hundreds of workers and employers without incident.|$|E

500|$|Kléber {{carried out}} {{his part of}} the scheme to perfection. Jourdan to cross the Rhine at Neuwied on 10 June. While Charles {{directed}} his forces against Jourdan, on 22 June, the Army of the Rhine and Moselle executed simultaneous crossings at Kehl and Hüningen. At Kehl, Moreau’s advance guard, 10,000 men, preceded the main force of 27,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry directed at a mere several hundred Swabian pickets on the bridge. The Swabian militia consisted of recruits provided by the members of the Swabian Circle and most of them were literally raw recruits, field hands and <b>day</b> <b>laborers</b> drafted for service in the spring of that year for the Reichsarmee. The Swabians were hopelessly outnumbered and could not be reinforced. Most of the Imperial Army of the Rhine was stationed further north, by Mannheim, where the river was easier to cross, but too far away to support the smaller force at Kehl. Neither Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé's Army of Condé in Freiburg nor Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg's force in Rastatt could reach Kehl in time to relieve the Swabian troops. Consequently, within a day, Moreau had four divisions across the river. Unceremoniously thrust out of Kehl, the Swabian contingent reformed at Rastatt by 5 July. [...] There they managed to hold the city until reinforcements arrived, although Charles could not move much of his army away from Mannheim or Karlsruhe, where the French had also formed across the river. [...] At Hüningen, near Basel, Ferino executed a full crossing, and advanced east along the German shore of the Rhine with the 16th and 50th Demi-brigades, the 68th, 50th and 68th line infantry, and six squadrons of cavalry that included the 3rd and 7th Hussars and the 10th Dragoons. [...] The Habsburg and Imperial armies were in danger of encirclement: the French pressed hard at Rastatt and Ferino moved quickly east along the shore of the Rhine via which they could encircle the Coalition army from the east.|$|E
