5|$|According to the United States Census Bureau, {{there are}} an {{estimated}} 5,045,356 <b>houses</b> in Ohio, of which 4,499,506, or about 89.2% are estimated to be occupied; this is 0.8% above the national average rate of occupation. <b>Houses</b> with a mortgage are estimated to cost owners about $1,216 per month, which is $186 below the national average. The United States Census Bureau also estimates that 3,150,239 <b>houses</b> are owner-occupied, or about 70%, which is 2.7% above the national average, and that an estimated 1,349,267 <b>houses</b> are renter-occupied. The median house value is $135,200, which is a significant $50,000 below the national average. Also, {{there are an}} estimated 545,850 unoccupied <b>houses.</b> It is also {{interesting to note that the}} plurality of <b>houses</b> in Ohio were built from 1940 to 1959 (1,175,325 <b>houses),</b> and that 3,058,721 <b>houses</b> are in some way dependent on utility gas.|$|E
5|$|All <b>houses</b> {{were built}} with marble-mantelpieced {{fireplaces}} and flues.

However, not all <b>houses</b> were supplied with gas or mains electricity from the outset, the remainder being lit by candles or oil or paraffin lamps.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>houses</b> at Gedi vary in size, {{their number}} of rooms, and their layout, the basic {{house at the}} site is a three-room structure, which usually {{contained}} a forecourt and domestic court. With the three-room layout, there was usually a long main room with two storage and sleeping quarters towards {{the back of the}} house. One of the back rooms usually had a storage compartment near the roof with access through a trapdoor. Latrines, usually located {{toward the back of the}} main room, were also present in many of the <b>houses,</b> while wells were present in the courtyards of some of the <b>houses.</b> One of the oldest stone <b>houses</b> dates to the fourteenth century and has a long narrow sunken court, which contrasts the wider and deeper courts found in <b>houses</b> constructed during the fifteenth century. The entrances of <b>houses</b> have a greater deal of variability in the configuration of their passageways, since many of the <b>houses</b> were highly concentrated and laid out to maximize the use of available space.|$|E

5|$|Building {{practices}} {{along the}} coast also included boathouses, fishing cottages, piers, etc. Here, <b>houses</b> for livestock and people were typically built up from the actual shoreline. A typical medium-sized farm in the inland of Norway would include a dwelling house (våningshus), hay barn (låve), livestock barn (fjøs), one or more food storage <b>houses</b> (stabbur), a stable, and occasionally separate <b>houses</b> for poultry, pigs, etc. <b>Houses</b> that had separate heat sources, e.g., washing <b>houses</b> (eldhus) and smithies were usually kept separate from the other <b>houses</b> to prevent fires. Outhouses were typically separate, small structures. If the farm housed craftsmen, there would also be separate <b>houses</b> for carpentry, wheel making, shoemaking, etc.|$|E
5|$|By {{the sixteenth}} century perhaps ten per cent of the {{population}} lived {{in one of the}} many burghs. A characteristic of Scottish burghs were long main streets of tall buildings, with vennels, wynds and alleys leading off it, many of which survive today. Many <b>houses</b> in Scottish towns had forms derived from those in major urban centres in Tuscany and the Low Countries, although realised with traditional Scottish techniques and materials. Timber-framed <b>houses</b> were common across urban centres in Europe, but, perhaps because of the shortage of large timbers and an abundance of workable stone in Scotland, <b>houses</b> with only timber fronts were more common. Despite the logistical problems timbered <b>houses</b> enjoyed a resurgence in the late sixteenth century, particularly in Edinburgh where there were large numbers of board, jettied and boarded construction. Increasingly half-timbered <b>houses</b> occurred beside the larger, stone and slate-roofed town <b>houses</b> of merchants and the urban gentry. By the late seventeenth century these had taken on a recognisably Flemish or Dutch appearance. They were often narrow, with four stories, gabled and crow stepped, but often built in stone and harl. They sometimes had ground floor arcades or piazzas. Most wooden thatched <b>houses</b> have not survived, but stone <b>houses</b> of the period can be seen in Edinburgh at Lady Stair's House, Acheson House and the six-story Gladstone's Land, an early example of the tendency to build upward in the increasingly crowded towns, producing horizontally divided tenements.|$|E
5|$|Estate <b>houses</b> in Scotland or Scottish country <b>houses,</b> {{are large}} <b>houses</b> usually on landed estates in Scotland. They were built from the sixteenth century, after {{defensive}} castles {{began to be}} replaced by more comfortable residences for royalty, nobility and local lairds. The origins of Scottish estate <b>houses</b> are in aristocratic emulation of the extensive building and rebuilding of royal residences, beginning with Linlithgow, under the influence of Renaissance architecture. In the 1560s the unique Scottish style of the Scots baronial emerged, which combined features from medieval castles, tower <b>houses,</b> and peel towers with Renaissance plans, in <b>houses</b> designed primarily for residence rather than defence.|$|E

5|$|Except for {{the corner}} <b>houses,</b> the <b>houses</b> {{were built in}} pairs, each sharing a porch with its neighbour.

All <b>houses</b> were designed with at least one parlour and with the kitchen, scullery, and toilet in separate rooms {{at the rear of the}} house; the first-class <b>houses</b> also had toilets upstairs.

5|$|Many of {{the late}} Medieval castles built in the borders were {{in the form of}} tower <b>houses,</b> smaller pele towers or simpler bastle <b>houses.</b> From the fifteenth century there was a phase of Renaissance palace building, which {{restructured}} them as castle-type palaces, beginning at Linlithgow. Elements of Medieval castles, royal palaces and tower <b>houses</b> were used in the construction of Scots baronial estate <b>houses,</b> which were built largely for comfort, but with a castle-like appearance. In {{the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries}} the military significance of castles declined, but they increasingly became tourist attractions. Elements of the Scots Baronial style would be revived from the late eighteenth century and the trend would be confirmed in popularity by the rebuilding of Balmoral Castle in the nineteenth century and its adoption as a retreat by Queen Victoria. In the twentieth century there were only isolated examples of new castle-influenced <b>houses.</b> Many tower <b>houses</b> were renovated, and many castles were taken over by the National Trust for Scotland or Historic Scotland and are open to the public.|$|E
