5|$|The {{idea for}} the attacks came from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who first {{presented}} it to Osama bin Laden in 1996. At that time, bin Laden and al-Qaeda were {{in a period of}} transition, <b>having</b> <b>just</b> relocated back to Afghanistan from Sudan.

5000|$|In 1995, Victoria Husted Medvec and two colleagues {{reported}} that [...] "athletes who <b>had</b> <b>just</b> won silver medals {{tended to be}} less happy than those who <b>had</b> <b>just</b> won bronze medals."

5|$|American {{planners}} {{believed that}} the Hadong area was under attack from elements of the North Korean 4th Infantry Division, <b>having</b> <b>just</b> received replacements following its victory at Taejon. However, the soldiers in the area were actually from the North Korean 6th Infantry Division {{under the command of}} General Pang Ho San. The two divisions were coordinating to envelop the UN's left flank and were extremely spread out. Therefore, only groups of a few hundred were advancing through the region, some with small numbers of tanks.|$|E
5|$|Available on a free transfer, Holroyd {{attracted}} {{the interest of}} Macclesfield Town, <b>having</b> <b>just</b> spent five months on loan with the club. However, no permanent transfer materialised, and, on 17 January 2013, he signed for League Two side Morecambe on a contract {{until the end of}} the 2012–13 season. Holroyd made his debut a day after signing for the club, coming on as a second-half substitute in a 0–0 home draw against Cheltenham Town.|$|E

5|$|Coxon and Laker came to {{the crease}} {{and put on a}} 41-run stand for the eighth wicket. After 85 minutes of resistance, Coxon hit a catch back to Johnson, ending his first Test innings for 19, and Laker was caught behind from the same bowler, having already been dropped twice in the slips.

5|$|Harlan argued to Goebbels that Söderbaum, <b>having</b> <b>just</b> given birth, was {{too weak}} to take on the role. Goebbels countered that a special room could be set up as a nursery and that a wet-nurse could be hired to care for the infant. He further offered to halt {{shooting}} if Söderbaum became ill. Harlan later reported that Söderbaum was so upset by the entire affair that she considered fleeing back to her native Sweden to avoid having to play the part of Dorothea. In the end, however, she decided to stay and performed the role.|$|E
5|$|<b>Having</b> <b>just</b> {{been elected}} to the Senate with Sherman's support, Garfield entered the 1880 {{campaign}} season committed to Sherman as his choice for the Republican presidential nominee. Even before the convention began, however, a few Republicans, including Wharton Barker of Philadelphia, thought Garfield {{the best choice for}} the nomination. Garfield denied any interest in the position, but the attention was enough to make Sherman suspicious of his lieutenant's ambitions. Besides Sherman, the early favorites for the nomination were Blaine and former president Grant, but several other candidates attracted delegates as well.|$|E

5|$|<b>Having</b> <b>just</b> nine turns, {{the fewest}} on the Formula One calendar, the circuit offers very few {{low-speed}} sections and gave teams {{an opportunity to}} push their power units to their potential. As in the previous year's event, and {{for the third straight}} event overall, the yellow-banded soft compound tyre were the prime dry selection while the red-banded supersoft compound were the option dry selection. Pirelli also supplied two wet weather compounds: the green-banded intermediate compound and the blue-banded full wet compound.|$|E

Instead, Roberts offers Lucas {{a chance at}} a shorter jail {{sentence}} if he aids his investigation of dirty cops in the NYPD and Lucas duly provides Roberts with the names. In the end, three quarters of the New York DEA are arrested and convicted, and a distraught Trupo commits suicide. Roberts, <b>having</b> <b>just</b> passed the bar exam, defends Lucas as his first client. Lucas is sentenced to 70 years in prison, of which he serves 15 years and is released in 1991.|$|E
5|$|Mary is {{presented}} as a Marian apparition; in this case she probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling in prayer in the now lost opposite panel. The idea of a saint appearing before laity was common in Northern art of the period, and is also represented in van Eyck's Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele (1434–36). There, the Canon is portrayed as if <b>having</b> <b>just</b> momentarily paused to reflect on a passage from his hand-held bible as the Virgin and Child with two saints appear before him, as if embodiments of his prayer.|$|E

5|$|Rhodes' initial {{response}} to the declaration of war was diplomatic; they asked the Roman Republic for help against Philip. The Romans, however, were wary of another war, the Second Punic War <b>having</b> <b>just</b> ended. The Roman Senate attempted to persuade the populace to enter the war, even after Pergamum, Cyzicus and Byzantium had joined the war on the Rhodians side, {{but was unable to}} sway the city's war-weary population.|$|E
5|$|The 1968 Republican National Convention {{was held}} from August 5 to 9 at the Miami Beach Convention Center in Miami Beach, Florida. At the convention, Richard Nixon won the {{nomination}} for President {{on the first}} ballot with 692 delegates. Behind him finished Governor Rockefeller, second with 277 delegates, followed by Governor Ronald Reagan, in third place, <b>having</b> <b>just</b> entered the race, accruing 182 delegates. Nixon's early nomination occurred partly because he held on to delegates in the South largely influenced by Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, and delegate Charlton Lyons of Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{context of}} the song, in the film Robin and the 7 Hoods, is the mob boss Robbo (Sinatra) <b>having</b> <b>just</b> been acquitted of murdering the sheriff, a crime {{for which he had}} been framed. He walks out of the courthouse and joyously sings the song in gratitude to the gathered crowd of Chicagoans. The people eventually join in the singing.

50|$|The {{decision}} of a juvenile garter snake {{to attack a}} predator can be affected by whether the snake <b>has</b> <b>just</b> eaten or not. Snakes that <b>have</b> <b>just</b> eaten {{are more likely to}} strike a predator or stimuli than snakes that do not have a full stomach. Snakes are more likely to flee a threatening situation if their stomachs are empty. Snakes that <b>have</b> <b>just</b> eaten a large animal are less mobile. Feeding positively affects endurance as opposed to speed.|$|R
