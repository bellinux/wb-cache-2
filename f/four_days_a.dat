5|$|GM halted {{production}} for about one {{month at the}} Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly plant by mid June 2011 to complete some upgrades, including the installation of new tooling, equipment and overhead conveyor systems throughout the facility. These upgrades allowed GM to triple the rate of Volt production and prepared the plant for 2012 Volt and Ampera production. After the plant retooling, the production rate reached 150 units per day <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>a</b> week by August 2011. The Volt plant was also down during January 2012 in preparation for building the California lower-emission version. A four-week shutdown due to slow sales took place between March and April 2012. GM said it had around 3,600 Volts in inventory and needed to reduce dealer inventories as production is expected to meet market demand. GM also extended the traditional two-week summer vacation by an extra week at the Hamtramck plant. GM closed its Detroit-Hamtramck plant from September 17 until October 15, 2012, affecting roughly 1,500 workers on downtime while the plant was retooled to assemble the all-new 2014 Chevrolet Impala alongside the 2013 Volt. This {{was the second time}} in 2012 that GM has halted Volt production.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of Bejisa, Électricité de France (EDF) {{deployed}} 500personnel and 6helicopters to restore power on the island. Within three days, roughly 160,000residences were restored, considerably faster than previous restoration efforts in previous cyclones. By January9, {{all but a few}} dozen homes had power. In addition, water supply was largely restored within <b>four</b> <b>days.</b> <b>A</b> state of national disaster was declared for Réunion on January17, by Overseas Minister of France, Victorin Lurel. This declaration covered 16towns on the island: Les Avirons, Cilaos, L'Entre-Deux, L'Étang-Salé, Petite-Île, La Plaine-des-Palmistes, Le Port, La Possession, Saint-Joseph, Saint-Leu, Saint-Louis, Saint-Paul, Saint-Pierre, Salazie, Le Tampon, and Trois-Bassins. Insurance estimates indicated that €25million (US$33.8million) was needed for relief funding. Farmers were eligible for compensation under the disaster declaration; however, many voiced their skepticism following a lack of follow-through by the government to supply funds after Tropical Cyclone Dumile in January 2013. Ultimately, the affected farmers had to indicate their taxed losses by February26 to receive the assistance. By April 2014, all farmers affected by the declaration were compensated.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 30 January, armor/engineer {{elements}} of the 1st Brigade, 5th Infantry Division headed west on Route 9 while the brigade's infantry elements were helilifted directly into the Khe Sanh area. By 5 February, Route 9 had been secured up to the Laotian frontier. Simultaneously, the 101st Airborne Division began a feint into the A Shau Valley in order to draw PAVN attention away from Khe Sanh. At the combat base, poor weather, obstacles, land mines, and unexploded ordnance pushed the rehabilitation of the airstrip (estimated by U.S. engineers at <b>four</b> <b>days)</b> <b>a</b> week behind schedule. As a response, a completely new airstrip had to be built and the first aircraft arrived on 15 February. PAVN resistance was almost nonexistent and American casualties were light; with no previous allied presence around Khe Sanh, the North Vietnamese had seen no need to maintain large forces in the area. However, General Sutherland believed that the advance to Khe Sanh had been a race between American and PAVN forces, and the U.S. had won.|$|E
5|$|Parishes {{arose from}} Church of England divisions, and were {{originally}} purely ecclesiastical divisions. Over time they acquired civil administration powers. The Highways Act 1555 made parishes {{responsible for the}} upkeep of roads. Every adult inhabitant of the parish was obliged to work <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>a</b> year on the roads, providing their own tools, carts and horses; the work was overseen by an unpaid local appointee, the Surveyor of Highways. The poor were looked after by the monasteries, until their dissolution. In 1572, magistrates were given power to 'survey the poor' and impose taxes for their relief. This system was made more formal by the Poor Law Act 1601, which made parishes responsible for administering the Poor Law; overseers were appointed to charge a rate to support the poor of the parish. The 19th century saw {{an increase in the}} responsibility of parishes, although the Poor Law powers were transferred to Poor Law Unions. The Public Health Act 1872 grouped parishes into Rural Sanitary Districts, based on the Poor Law Unions; these subsequently formed the basis for Rural Districts. Parishes were run by vestries, meeting annually to appoint officials, and were generally identical to ecclesiastical parishes, although some townships in large parishes administered the Poor Law themselves; under the Parishes Act 1882, all extra-parochial areas and townships that levied a separate rate became independent civil parishes.|$|E
5|$|Passenger traffic {{started on}} 10 October 1825, after the {{required}} licence was purchased, using the Experiment coach hauled by a horse. The coach was initially timetabled {{to travel from}} Stockton to Darlington in two hours, with a fare of 1s, and made a return journey <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>a</b> week and a one-way journey on Tuesdays and Saturdays. In April 1826 {{the operation of the}} coach was contracted for £200 a year; by then the timetabled journey time had been reduced to hours and passengers were allowed to travel on the outside for 9d. A more comfortable coach, Express, started the same month and charged 1s 6d for travel inside. Innkeepers began running coaches, two to Shildon from July, and the Union, which served the Yarm branch from 16 October. There were no stations: in Darlington the coaches picked up passengers near the north road crossing, whereas in Stockton they picked up at different places on the quay. Between 30,000 and 40,000 passengers were carried between July 1826 and June 1827.|$|E

25|$|In November 1947, the Haganah was an {{underground}} paramilitary force that had existed {{as a highly}} organized, national force, since the Arab riots of 1920–21, and throughout the riots of 1929, Great Uprising of 1936–39, and World War 2. It had a mobile force, the HISH, which had 2,000 full-time fighters (men and women) and 10,000 reservists (all aged between 18 and 25) and an elite unit, the Palmach composed of 2,100 fighters and 1,000 reservists. The reservists trained three or <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>a</b> month {{and went back to}} civilian life the rest of the time. These mobile forces could rely on a garrison force, the HIM (Heil Mishmar, lit. Guard Corps), composed of people aged over 25.

25|$|On 22 October, Maalin {{fell ill}} with fever and headache, and {{received}} malaria treatment in hospital. After <b>four</b> <b>days</b> <b>a</b> rash appeared.

Over the next few days, his symptoms developed to indicate smallpox as the cause. Not wishing to be put into isolation, Maalin failed to report himself. On 30 October, a male nurse colleague reported him, possibly for the reward of 200 Somali shillings (around $35), and Maalin was transferred to the isolation camp. He was diagnosed with an infection of the Variola minor strain of smallpox, based on his symptoms and later confirmed by laboratory tests. The date of diagnosis is sometimes stated as 26 October 1977. Maalin did not experience complications, and subsequently recovered fully and was discharged in late November.|$|E
