In a real scenario, the stations are {{most of the times}} non-saturated and unicast and broadcast frames exist. These specific characteristics influence the service time which consequently affects the queue behaviour. In this paper, we model the total <b>frame’s</b> <b>delay</b> for IEEE 802. 11 DCF networks in presence of both unicast and broadcast traffic. Our theoretical analysis proposes a model able to compute the time between the instant when a new frame is inserted on the transmission queue and the instant when its transmission finishes. The time needed to serve a frame (service time) is formally deduced from the IEEE 802. 11 transmission procedure, conceptually using the view of one network’s node. We use an M/M/ 1 /K queue model in order to model each <b>frame’s</b> queueing <b>delay.</b> We validate the total <b>frame’s</b> <b>delay</b> using several simulations and present some results.

30|$|Obviously, the {{content-based}} PVC in [22] outperforms the PVC with pre-defined regular-shaped patterns [12, 13] due to {{the better}} moving-region shape approximation. The limitations of the content-based PVC approach are its <b>frame</b> <b>delay</b> due to pattern generation using future frames (and then encode the frames using the generated patterns) and requirement of bits for encoding patterns themselves for transmission to the decoder (to make the same PC available at the encoder and decoder). Intuitively, by processing {{a smaller number of}} future frames provides better object shape approximation (by the generated patterns) with reduced <b>frame</b> <b>delay</b> but requires more bits to encode patterns themselves (after each time of pattern generation). On the other hand, processing a larger number of future frames provides poorer shape approximation (and fewer bits for encoding patterns themselves) with increased <b>frame</b> <b>delay</b> for pattern generation and encoding frames. Thus, in the proposed ASPVC scheme, we use a small number of decoded frames to generate patterns and encode future frames. As we do not use any future frame in the pattern generation process, the proposed scheme does not bring about any <b>frame</b> <b>delay.</b> Moreover, the proposed ASPVC scheme uses the same procedure to generate pattern templates at the encoder and the decoder, and thus, we do not need to encode the shape of pattern templates. As a result, better rate-distortion performance can be achieved {{due to the}} saving of bits which are previously used for pattern-shaped coding.|$|E

Significant amount of rate-distortion performance and computational performance are sacrificed due to separate encoding {{due to the}} lack of exploitation of joint information. Obviously, separate encoding also creates synchronization issue for 3 D scene formation in the decoder. Moreover, the hierarchical frame referencing architecture in the MVC creates random access <b>frame</b> <b>delay.</b> In this paper we develop an encoder and decoder framework where we can encode texture and depth video jointly by forming and encoding 3 D cuboid using high dimensional entropy coding.

Thus, intuitively any attempt to encode a video by the PVC technique using content-based pattern templates generated through the adaptation of the MRs of the video will eventually provide a better coding performance [22].

Sophisticated and efficient bandwidth allocation mechanisms are required to cope with the imposed propagation delay in LR-PONs. In this study, we evaluate three dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) frameworks in terms of frame (packet) delay; namely, we consider conventional (interleaved) polling for traditional PON and two recently introduced scheduling paradigms for next gen-eration LR-PON, i. e., multi-thread polling (MT-P) and real-time polling (RT-P). We enhance MT-P and RT-P by applying the just-in-time framework. Next, we provide an analytical framework for evaluating the end-to-end <b>frame</b> <b>delay</b> in our enhanced MT-P and RT-P frameworks.
