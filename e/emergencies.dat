30|$|In the cross-regional <b>emergency</b> scenario, {{we witness}} three effects. First, when the maximum <b>emergency</b> {{capability}} on line 2 is changed, {{the change in}} the scheduling quantity in the cross-regional mode coincides with it in the single one. However, the variational change of cross-regional <b>emergency</b> dispatching is smaller. Second, when the maximum <b>emergency</b> capability is increased, the minimum <b>emergency</b> costs decrease, and these costs are greater than those in the single one. However, when the maximum <b>emergency</b> capability is decreased, the minimum <b>emergency</b> costs increase and the costs are less than the single mode. Third, the generalized <b>emergency</b> costs are less than the single mode. When the maximum <b>emergency</b> capability is decreased, the generalized <b>emergency</b> costs sharply decline. Furthermore, the increase in the maximum <b>emergency</b> capability leads to an argument with the petroleum <b>emergency</b> quantity. Then, the total network coordination quantity increases and the generalized <b>emergency</b> costs sharply decline. All of these show that the cross-regional <b>emergency</b> coordination mode is better than single region <b>emergency</b> dispatching.|$|R

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of urban rail transit in China recently, improving its quick <b>emergency</b> response capability {{is becoming an}} important issue. Based on the perspective of inter-organizational collaboration, {{this article examines the}} formation mechanism of quick <b>emergency</b> response capability of urban rail transit and proposes the concept model hypothesis, in order to highlight the inter-organizational <b>emergency</b> collaboration relationships and the quick <b>emergency</b> response capability. According to site surveys and analysis of the elements of inter-organizational collaboration in <b>emergency</b> rescue and the meaning of quick <b>emergency</b> response capability, the scale of <b>emergency</b> collaboration and <b>emergency</b> response capability is designed, and the hypothetical concept model is tested by structural equation model. The results indicate that the <b>emergency</b> collaboration can be realized mainly through <b>emergency</b> organizations, resources, plans, and information. These elements interact with each other; the quick <b>emergency</b> response capability includes fast reaction and <b>emergency</b> disposal capability, <b>emergency</b> decision and execution capability, and coordination and joint action capability. These capabilities restrict each other. Moreover, <b>emergency</b> collaboration has significant but different influence on different dimensions of quick <b>emergency</b> response capability. Therefore, allocating and controlling <b>emergency</b> elements are pivotal to realizing inter-organizational <b>emergency</b> collaboration and generating the quick <b>emergency</b> response capability of urban rail transit...|$|R

30|$|All {{types of}} work in the <b>emergency</b> system are performed, constructed, and {{improved}} in accordance with the “one network and five databases” and “one platform” projects.

30|$|In {{the single}} region <b>emergency</b> scenario, with an {{increase}} in the <b>emergency</b> path’s vulnerability, the total <b>emergency</b> scheduling quantity has a slight increase to 5.1, the minimum <b>emergency</b> costs remain virtually unchanged, and the generalized <b>emergency</b> costs of the entire network greatly increase from 39.5 to 58.6. To relieve the shortage condition, the rescue points should be appropriately increased to allocate more <b>emergency</b> funds if the path vulnerability increases. In short, different vulnerabilities for the <b>emergency</b> path will result in an <b>emergency</b> scheduling quantity change, which further affects the minimum relief costs and the generalized <b>emergency</b> costs at each crisis. Increasing the robustness of the <b>emergency</b> path can effectively improve the <b>emergency</b> response efficiency.|$|R

30|$|Based on the {{existing}} studies, we analyse the interaction pattern of resources and information in these petroleum shortage <b>emergency</b> events.

First, the cross-regional scheduling framework of a petroleum <b>emergency</b> is constructed by clarifying the influencing factors of <b>emergency</b> dispatch. Then, we analyse the changes of <b>emergency</b> volume and <b>emergency</b> costs in the petroleum <b>emergency</b> supernetwork model for both a single region and the cross-regional scenario. Finally, according to the influence on the cross-regional <b>emergency</b> scheduling, we propose some policy recommendations to effectively enhance the entire petroleum <b>emergency</b> management system.|$|R

30|$|In the cross-regional <b>emergency</b> scenario, with an {{increase}} in the <b>emergency</b> path’s vulnerability, the <b>emergency</b> scheduling quantity has a slight increase 0.004, but its total <b>emergency</b> scheduling quantity is less than the single region mode. Additionally, the minimum relief costs increase from 1190.38 to 1190.39, and this value is 0.5 larger than in the single region. Finally, its generalized <b>emergency</b> costs are all less than the single ones (39.5 [*]>[*] 35.9, 58.6 [*]>[*] 54.6), and the degree of generalized <b>emergency</b> costs’ decrease is more than 3.5.
