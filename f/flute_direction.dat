40|$|Paper {{physicists}} {{have known}} that a corrugated box constructed from outer liner sheets having a predominant fiber orientation aligned with the corrugating <b>flute</b> <b>direction</b> would have higher stiffness and crush resistance (per unit of fiber weight) than the conventional box construction. Such increased performance per unit of fiber weight could result in fiber reduction and energy savings for boxes having equivalent performance specifications. The goal of this project was to develop and demonstrate a commercially viable lateral corrugating process. This included designing and building a pilot lateral corrugator, testing and evaluating pilot machine made boxes, and developing a strategy for commercialization...|$|E
5000|$|Twinwall {{extruded}} polypropylene sheet {{has been}} used from the mid nineties. Commonly known as Correx in the United Kingdom, it is mentioned in the sections above. Currently the Mugi group based in West Yorkshire still promote and use this material in 2mm thickness sheet form. Very tough and lightweight it has only two disadvantages. Firstly it needs particular two-part contact glues. Secondly the material is difficult to paint due to low surface adhesion. Self-adhesive coloured tapes were the answer. Components are often laminated, taking advantage of differing <b>flute</b> <b>directions</b> for strength and forming. Models tend to exceed 900mm wingspan with carbon fibre tubing used for local reinforcement. The thickness used among modellers is from 2mm to 4 mm thickness. Models made out of this material are commonly known among modellers as [...] "Spad" [...] types (simple plastic aeroplane design).|$|R

50|$|Another type of {{overblowing}} is {{that used}} on instruments {{such as the}} <b>flute,</b> where the <b>direction</b> of the airstream is altered in order to sound higher notes. This technique can also be demonstrated when blowing {{across the top of}} a glass bottle (beer bottle, wine bottle, etc.) to produce a pitch.|$|R
50|$|The foot {{end of the}} <b>flute</b> {{can have}} <b>{{direction}}</b> holes.These holes affect the pitch of the flute when all the finger holes are covered.The direction holes also relate to (and derive their name from) the Four Directions ofEast, South, West, and North found in many Native American stories.The direction holes can also be called the tuning holes or wind holes.|$|R
40|$|The Aptian {{succession}} of the Vocontian paleomargin (SE France) consists of marl-prone mass transport deposits, turbidite sandstone and pelagic marl. A detailed stratigraphic framework, {{which was established}} by previous workers, allows correlation of individual event beds for up to 80 kilometres in the down-dip direction. One thick-bedded turbidite sandstone that is interbedded between two mass transport deposits is studied in several outcrops. The thickness of this sandstone bed is very variable. This paper aims to reconstruct the origin of these thickness variations. Detailed outcrop descriptions, {{with a focus on}} the nature of the contact of the turbidite with the underlying and overlying mass transport deposits, are presented. Multiple origins for sandstone thickness variation are recognised. Loading and injection are restricted to a relatively small scale and have only resulted in minor sandstone thickness variations. Infill of mass transport related topography acted on a much wider range of scales and resulted in thickness variations with an amplitude of up to ten meters. The elevated topography at the surface of the mass transport deposits is associated with compressional deformation zones within these deposits. The inference that the geometry a turbiditic sandstone is, to a large extend, controlled by the surface morphology of mass transport deposits is contrasting an earlier interpretation, in which the heterogeneity was attributed to the presence of multiple parallel turbidite channels. This reinterpretation yields that the planform geometry of the sandstone may be different than previously thought. Several types of field data that indicate directly that surface topography, created by mass transport deposits, indeed affected the flow dynamics of turbidity currents. A scour hole upstream of an obstruction indicates that erosion by turbidity currents was locally enhanced. Deviating <b>flute</b> <b>directions</b> on the flanks of obstructions indicates that flows were deflected...|$|R
50|$|Najee's musical pursuits {{began in}} grade school at age eight, where he began playing the clarinet, {{but he had a}} deep desire to play saxophone. He was {{influenced}} at this age by listening to his mother's recordings of Miles Davis and other legendary American jazz artists. A pivotal moment in his life began when he made the decision to become a professional jazz musician. In high school, Najee began to study jazz as a student at the Jazzmobile program (co-founded by Dr. Billy Taylor) where he honed his skills on tenor saxophone and <b>flute</b> under the <b>direction</b> of Jimmy Heath, Frank Foster and Ernie Wilkins. At age 16, Najee studied flute at the Manhattan School of Music Preparatory Division, where he took lessons with Harold Jones, flautist from the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.|$|R
5000|$|He did {{not return}} to opera until 1934, when he participated in the first ventures at Glyndebourne. He sang on the opening night and {{appeared}} in every season until 1939, also singing on the last night before the outbreak of war in 1939. He sang the role of the Count in The Marriage of Figaro, Masetto in Don Giovanni, Guglielmo in Cos√¨ fan tutte, and Papageno in The Magic <b>Flute,</b> under the <b>direction</b> of Fritz Busch, who commended him highly. He also took the role of Peachum in The Beggar's Opera. His Count is preserved in the Busch (Glyndebourne 1936) HMV recording of The Marriage of Figaro. [...] His Masetto is in the Busch (Glyndebourne, c.1937-8) Don Giovanni. [...] For these years, Glyndebourne became his artistic home. Henderson was an outstanding Mozart singer.|$|R
