50|$|About {{the time}} of budbreak in the spring, apothecia develop from overwintered pseudosclerotia—the hardened, dried-out “mummified” remains of {{previously}} diseased fruit. Mummies are typically spherical and approximately 0.5 inches in diameter. Apothecia are generally 1 to 2 inches tall. These apothecia discharge ascospores over 10-14 days. Ascospores infect succulent young developing shoots (0.5 - 1.5 inches long), causing tip blight. This is the primary infection. Come bloom (about 3-4 weeks after primary infection), conidia are produced on the infected shoots and are dispersed to infect open flowers. Conidia borne either by wind or insect deposition may land on the <b>flower</b> <b>stigma,</b> germinate, grow down the style, and colonize the ovary. This is the secondary infection.|$|E
40|$|Abstract – Several insect species visited exotic Rhododendron ponticum flowers, but {{bumblebees}} {{were most}} common. Only bumblebees (and one Vespula) contacted the <b>flower</b> <b>stigma</b> whilst foraging and {{are probably the}} main pollinators. One-third of insect visits resulted in stigma contact and visitation rates were high. This explains the high seed set reported elsewhere. There were significant differences according to the body size of visitors, with large queen bees contacting stigmas more often than smaller workers. There {{were no significant differences}} in behaviour of three species (Bombus jonellus, B. lucorum and B. monticola) and all bees tended to move short distances between flowers on a single plant. Longer flights and movements among plants were rare. Pollen carryover was estimated to be high: there was no decline in the amount of pollen deposited on stigmas from the first to fifth flower visited. The impact of bee behaviour on reproduction and invasion by exotic R. ponticum is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Comolia ovalifolia DC Triana (Melastomataceae) and Chamaecrista ramosa (Vog.) H. S. Irwin and Barneby var. ramosa (Leguminosae - Caesalpinioideae) are {{tropical}} plant species found in restinga (herbaceous-shrubby, sandy costal ecosystems). They have flowers with poricidal anthers and are pollinated by bees. The {{study sought to}} analyse potential pollinators of both plants during visits to their flowers in a restinga area in Bahia. The flowering displayed by both species was considered continuous and long duration, constantly providing pollen to floral visitors. C. ovalifolia was visited by 17 species of bees and C. ramosa by 16 species, predominantly from the Apidae family (with a similarity index of 74 %). The behavior displayed by these visiting bees was of vibrating anthers. The small-sized Euglossa sp. Latreille, 1802 and Florilegus similis Urban, 1970 bees played less of a role as pollinators, since they rarely touched the <b>flower</b> <b>stigma</b> during harvests and were thus considered opportunist visitors or casual pollinators. Centris decolorata Lepetier, 1841 (= C. leprieuri) and Xylocopa subcyanea Perez, 1901 are large bees and were considered efficient pollinators of C. ovalifolia and C. ramosa because of the higher frequency and constancy of their visits, and their favourable behaviour and size for pollen transfer between flowers, which guarantees the survival of these native restinga plant species...|$|E

In this study, the regulatory elements of PsMPT promoter involved in chilling response were further analyzed. The PsMPT transcript was detected in different tree peony tissues and was highly {{expressed in the}} flower organs, including petal, stigma and stamen. An 1174 bp of the PsMPT promoter was isolated by TAIL-PCR, and the PsMPT promoter::GUS transgenic Arabidopsis was generated and analyzed. GUS staining and qPCR showed that the promoter was active in mainly the <b>flower</b> <b>stigma</b> and stamen. Moreover, {{it was found that}} the promoter activity was enhanced by chilling, NaCl, GA, ACC and NAA, but inhibited by ABA, mannitol and PEG. In transgenic plants harboring 421 bp of the PsMPT promoter, the GUS gene expression and the activity were significantly increased by chilling treatment. When the fragment from - 421 to - 408 containing a MYC cis-element was deleted, the chilling response could not be observed. Further mutation analysis confirmed that the MYC element was one of the key motifs responding to chilling in the PsMPT promoter.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, the PIN family comprised of 8 members, divided into ‘short’ and ‘long’ PINs {{according to the length}} of the hydrophilic domain of the protein. Based on sequence homology using the recently published potato genome sequence (Solanum tuberosum group Phureja) we identified ten annotated potato StPIN genes. Mining the publicly available gene expression data, we constructed a catalogue tissue specificity of StPIN gene expression, focusing on the process of tuberization. A total of four StPIN genes exhibited increased expression four days after tuber induction, prior to the onset of stolon swelling. For two PIN genes, StPIN 4 and StPIN 2, promoter sequences were cloned and fused to the GUS reporter protein to study tissue specificity in more detail. StPIN 4 promoter driven GUS staining was detected in the <b>flower</b> <b>stigma,</b> in the flower style, below the ovary and petals, in the root tips, in the vascular tissue of the stolons and in the tuber parenchyma cells. StPIN 2 promoter driven GUS staining was detected in flower buds, in the vascular tissue of the swelling stolons and in the storage parenchyma of the growing tubers. Based on our results, we postulate a role for the StPINs in redistributing auxin in the swelling stolon during early events in tuber development...|$|E

40|$|The editor {{version is}} {{available}} at: [URL] stigma anatomy {{is well documented}} for {{a good number of}} species, little information is available on the acquisition and cessation of stigmatic receptivity. The aim of this work is to characterize the development of stigma receptivity, from anthesis to stigma degeneration, in the pentacarpellar pear (Pyrus communis) <b>flower.</b> <b>Stigma</b> development and stigmatic receptivity were monitored over two consecutive years, as the capacity of the stigmas to offer support for pollen germination and pollen tube growth. In an experiment where hand pollinations were delayed for specified times after anthesis, three different stigmatic developmental stages could be observed: (1) immature stigmas, which allow pollen adhesion but not hydration; (2) receptive stigmas, which allow proper pollen hydration and germination; and (3) degenerated stigmas, in which pollen hydrates and germinates properly, but pollen tube growth is impaired soon after germination. This developmental characterization showed that stigmas in different developmental stages coexist within a flower and that the acquisition and cessation of stigmatic receptivity by each carpel occur in a sequential manner. In this way, while the duration of stigmatic receptivity for each carpel is rather short, the flower has an expanded receptive period. This asynchronous period of receptivity for the different stigmas of a single flower is discussed as a strategy that could serve to maximize pollination resources under unreliable pollination conditions.

40|$|Inositol polyphosphates, such as {{inositol}} trisphosphate, are pivotal intracellular signaling {{molecules in}} eukaryotic cells. In higher plants the {{mechanism for the}} regulation of the type {{and the level of}} these signaling molecules is poorly understood. In this study we investigate the physiological function of an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) gene encoding inositol polyphosphate kinase (AtIPK 2 a), which phosphorylates inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate successively at the D- 6 and D- 3 positions, and inositol 1, 3, 4, 5 -tetrakisphosphate at D- 6, resulting in the generation of inositol 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 -pentakisphosphate. Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR and promoter-{beta}-glucuronidase reporter gene analyses showed that AtIPK 2 a is expressed in various tissues, including roots and root hairs, stem, leaf, pollen grains, pollen tubes, the <b>flower</b> <b>stigma,</b> and siliques. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing the AtIPK 2 a antisense gene under its own promoter were generated. Analysis of several independent transformants exhibiting strong reduction in AtIPK 2 a transcript levels showed that both pollen germination and pollen tube growth were enhanced in the antisense lines compared to wild-type plants, especially in the presence of nonoptimal low Ca 2 + concentrations in the culture medium. Furthermore, root growth and root hair development were also stimulated in the antisense lines, in the presence of elevated external Ca 2 + concentration or upon the addition of EGTA. In addition, seed germination and early seedling growth was stimulated in the antisense lines. These observations suggest a general and important role of AtIPK 2 a, and hence inositol polyphosphate metabolism, in the regulation of plant growth most likely through the regulation of calcium signaling, consistent with the well-known function of inositol trisphosphate in the mobilization of intracellular calcium stores...|$|E

Further, it has been hypothesized {{that the presence of}} heterospecific pollen on <b>flower</b> <b>stigmas</b> adversely affects plant reproduction with increasing effect in closely related species. Using two pairs of co-occurring buzz-pollinated Thysanotus spp. in the Mediterranean climate region of Perth, Western Australia, we quantified the effect of heterospecific pollen on fruit and seed set. We first determined the mating systems of the two focal species using self- and outcross pollen, followed by separate treatments with heterospecific pollen within each species pair. Of the two species receiving pollen, Thysanotus triandrus had a mixed mating system, but with significantly lower fruit and seed set from self-pollen relative to outcross pollen. Thysanotus tenellus was autogamous with no difference in fruit or seed set between autogamous, self- or outcross pollinations. Heterospecific pollen had no effect on fruit or seed set of either focal species. These outcomes point to post-pollination reproductive isolation, consistent with a floral morphology that causes low specificity of pollen placement and thus a poor capacity for pre-pollination discrimination.
