Mobitex, a Public Access Mobile Radio network standard had been conceived in 1981, and put into operation in the mid-1980s. The cooperation programme between France and Germany was known as S900 (from the 900Mhz waveband, and was analogue) and {{was expected to be}} in operation by 1986.

The Europe-wide Eurosignal paging service had been in operation since 1974.

40|$|The Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) {{is widely}} {{recognized}} as the modern <b>digital</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>network</b> architecture. Increasing market demands point toward the relevancy of security-related issues in communications. The security requirements of mobile communications for the mobile users include: (1) the authentication of the mobile user and Visitor Location Register/Home Location Register; (2) the data confidentiality between mobile station and Visitor Location Register, and the data confidentiality between Visitor Location Register and Visitor Location Register/Home Location Register (VLR/HLR); (3) the location privacy of mobile user. However, GSM does not provide enough security functions to meet these requirements. We propose three improved methods to enhance the security, to reduce the storage space, to eliminate the sensitive information stored in VLR, and consequently to improve {{the performance of the}} system. Proposed methods include an improved authentication protocol for the mobile station, a data confidentiality protocol, and a location privacy protocol. The merit of the proposed methods is to improve but not to alter the existing architecture of the system. Furthermore, this study also performs computational and capacity analyses to evaluate the original GSM system and proposed approaches on a comparative basis...|$|E

The next challenge in the development of <b>digital</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>networks</b> is the integration of data and voice services in a unique platform. It seems to be that Asynchronous Transfer Mode technology (ATM) will be the transport technology candidate to support both types of services (voice and data) and can therefore offer the flexibility required by the Third Generation Mobile Systems. ATM supports the very-low-bit-rate applications, which are typical of voice services. Used directly, however, it is inefficient. Therefore it is needed an adaptation level for ATM that provides an efficient transmission of variable length packets at low bit rate. The ATM Adaptation Layer type 2 (AAL 2) has been chosen for the Third Generation Mobile Systems.

The {{introduction}} of <b>digital</b> <b>mobile</b> <b>networks</b> such as GSM has reduced the popularity of NMT and the Nordic countries have suspended their NMT networks.

40|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>mobile</b> {{telecommunication}} <b>networks</b> {{are highly}} complex systems and thus their planning, management and optimization are challenging tasks. Subscribers of a <b>mobile</b> <b>network</b> expect network availability, connection throughput and affordability. Moreover, their connection should not degrade or be lost abruptly {{as they move}} within the network area. The user expectations constitute the Quality of Service (QoS). To gain a competitive edge on other operators, the operating personnel have to measure the network {{in terms of the}} QoS. By analyzing the information in the measurements, they can manage and improve the quality of service. But sometimes they find it difficult to elicit essential information from complex data to improve the QoS. It is here that the recently developed data mining methods come in handy. Three data mining methods were applied to actual GSM network performance measurements. In this thesis, the methods were chosen to help the operating staff to find the essential information in network quality performance measurements. The personnel's prior knowledge of the network and their possible inexperience of the theory behind the methods was taken into account. The results show that the analyst can make good use of rough sets and Classification And Regression Trees (CART), because their information can be expressed in plain language rules that preserve the variable names of the original measurement. In addition, the CART and the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) provide effective visual means for interpreting the data set, for the operator can understand both the rules and the visualization information with little effort. Undoubtedly, the methods we used are applicable also to the next generation, UMTS network, because similar performance measurements are used in that network environment...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of a dependability framework for the call-processing environment in a <b>digital</b> <b>mobile</b> telephone <b>network</b> controller. The target environment includes a database subsystem containing configuration parameters and resource usage status, and call-processing clients for managing individual calls. This environment presents some unique challenges, since a malfunctioning client can write erroneous data to the database, and errors in the database can impact the call-processing clients. The paper describes an integrated dependability framework for the controller. The framework contains a data audit subsystem to maintain the structural and semantic integrity of the database and a preemptive control flow checking technique, PECOS, to protect the clients. Evaluation of the dependability-enhanced system by software-implemented error injection is performed. The evaluation shows that for control flow errors in the client, the combination of PECOS and data audit eliminates fail-silence violations, reduces the incidence of client crashes from 52 % to 19 %, and eliminates client hangs. For database injections, data audit detects 85 % of the errors and reduces the incidence of escaped errors from 63 % to 13 %. Evaluation of combined use of data and control checking (while error injection targets the database and the client) shows coverage of 80 % and indicates data flow errors as a key reason for error escapes.
