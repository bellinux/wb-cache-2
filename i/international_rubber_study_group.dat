30|$|Rubber Hevea brasililiensis L. (Willd. ex Adr. de Juss.) Müell. Arg.], {{a native}} tree spp. in the Amazon basin, was domesticated as a {{plantation}} crop {{in the south}} and southeast Asian countries during {{the latter part of the}} 1870 ’s. This commercially and environmentally important plantation crop has been now spread over 10.3 million hectares globally and it is dominated by the Asian region with 93 % of the extent (<b>International</b> <b>Rubber</b> <b>Study</b> <b>Group</b> 2012). In the tropical Asian countries, rubber is grown on highly weathered soils characterized by very low organic C contents (Zhang et al. 2007) due to intensive cultivation over 100 years. Maintaining an appropriate level of soil organic matter and biological cycling of nutrients is crucial to the success of any soil management in the humid tropics. Application of compost, plant residues as mulching materials or growing cover crops have been adopted successfully to enhance nutrient cycling and use efficiency. However, such are experienced to be not sustainable technologies to enhance soil organic C reserves and maintain an improved soil fertility as most of organic matter decompose very rapidly under hot and humid tropical conditions (Jenkinson and Ayanaba 1977). Organic amendments, therefore, have to be applied repeatedly at short intervals to sustain soil productivity.|$|E
30|$|Para {{rubber tree}} (Hevea brasiliensis) {{is a major}} {{economically}} important bio-resource because its sap-like extract (known as latex) can be collected and is {{the primary source of}} natural rubber. The white or yellow latex occurs in latex vessels in the bark, mostly outside the phloem. According to world food and agriculture organization (FAO) statistics, in 2010, Thailand produced the highest quantity (3, 051, 780 metric tons) of natural rubber in the world followed by Indonesia (2, 788, 300 metric tons) and Malaysia (858, 900 metric tons) [1]. <b>International</b> <b>Rubber</b> <b>Study</b> <b>Group</b> (IRSG) estimated the production of Para rubber of the world in 2011 to be 10.7 million tons which is more than that of the year 2010 (10.2 million tons) [2]. Main Para rubber products include field latex, concentrated latex, rubber sheet, crepe, and block rubber. Incisions are made orthogonally to the latex vessels, just deep enough to tap the vessels without harming the tree’s growth, and the sap is collected in small buckets. It is known that harvesting can be started once the trees are 5 – 6  years old. The field latex is the primary raw material for other processes. Total solid content (TSC) and dry rubber content (DRC) of field latex are the most important parameters in trading. However, the conventional wet-lab measurement procedures in terms of these parameters are time consuming and require technical experts. Therefore, it is preferable to introduce convenient evaluation technique at in-line process for rubber products or on-site work of Para rubber tree plantation.|$|E

40|$|Natural rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) {{is one of}} the {{plantation}} commodities, which {{plays an important role in}} the economic development of many countries. Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia have dominated the supply of natural rubber in the world market. Instead of being a major producing country in the world around years 1970 s until the 1980 s, Malaysia has lost its position to Thailand and Indonesia. All data used in this study is secondary panel data, which is a combination of time series data. Time series data includes annual data from 1965 to 2015. The data used were collected from FAOSTAT, <b>International</b> <b>Rubber</b> <b>Study</b> <b>Group</b> (IRSG), Department Of Statistics Malaysia, and Malaysian Rubber Board. The method that used to answer the first objective is graph analysis, whereas for the second objective by Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) and Herfindahl Hirschman Index (HHI) and for the third objective were measured by Import Deficiency Ratio (IDR) and Self-Sufficiency Ratio (SSR). The result shows that Malaysia has comparative advantage in natural rubber industry is proved by RCA value 1. 45 > 1. Meanwhile, HHI value 2832 > 1800 showed Malaysian natural rubber industry have a high market concentration in the global market. The average percentage of IDR is 80 % - 200 % and SSR above 120 % showed Malaysian natural rubber industry is relatively more specialized in the natural rubber industry. Based on the research, Malaysia has strong and energized in the rubber industry and dominated 50 % market share in the world, which is Malaysia, has high competitiveness level in the rubber industry. As a recommendation, more research is needed to investigate the problems that influence rubber industry in Malaysia...|$|E
40|$|Natural rubber {{demand was}} 11 million tons in 2014 and is {{expected}} to reach 16 million tons by 2025 according to the <b>International</b> <b>Rubber</b> <b>Study</b> <b>Group</b> (IRSG). The expected limitation of natural rubber from Hevea induced an interest for the development of alternative sources of natural rubber. Guayule (Parthenium argentatum Gray L.), being native to the Mexican Chihuahua desert, is a perennial crop of semi-arid area, with the potential of growing in the Mediterranean area. To assess the potential of guayule cultivation, CIRAD (France) and Wageningen University (The Netherlands) have conducted some on-farm guayule trials in southern Europe in partnership within the European based production and exploitation of alternative rubber and latex sources project (EU-PEARLS). Promising agronomic results have led to assess the profitability of a guayule commodity chain in the Mediterranean Europe area. Data on farming practices, biorefinery, costs of inputs were collected from the trials conducted in Spain and France, and from farmers and farmers' organizations in both countries. At farm level, different cost scenarios were tested, with guayule biomass being the sole output, with annual or biennial harvests. Our results showed that, based on a nine-year field cultivation, the farmer's breakeven point can be reached at a sale price of € 147 ton− 1 of dry biomass (at 12 ton ha− 1). At factory level, the biorefiner needs to sell water-extracted rubber as latex. By adding solvent extraction, it is possible to extract the remaining percentage of total rubber and the resin. In such case, the biorefiner's profits rises to € 691 ton− 1 of extracted rubber, making guayule cultivation profitable. Bagasse sale for electricity production or wood pellets is a bonus to be considered too. Our results showed that, in these conditions, a guayule value chain in Europe could be profitable. We extrapolated the results from our experiments to other Mediterranean countrie's culture conditions. Our results showed that guayule cultivation would probably be more beneficial in the Southern Mediterranean countries, including Spain, than in the Northern countries (South of France). Introduction of guayule production in the Mediterranean region could contribute to improved sustainability in rural development projects, allow a new economic development of the regions, and contribute to provide a new sustainable crop alternative against the impacts of climate change such as longer and more severe drought stress.
