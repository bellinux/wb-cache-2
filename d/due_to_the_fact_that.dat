5|$|A common {{misconception}} is that {{signs are}} iconically self-explanatory, {{that they are}} a transparent imitation of what they mean, or even that they are pantomime. In fact, many signs bear no resemblance to their referent, either because they were originally arbitrary symbols or because their iconicity has been obscured over time. Even so, in ASL iconicity plays a significant role; a high percentage of signs resemble their referents in some way. This may be <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the medium of sign—three-dimensional space—naturally allows more iconicity than oral language.|$|E
5|$|A crypt was {{constructed}} beneath the former Chapel of St. Anthony in 2009 {{to house the}} remains of former Bishops of Hong Kong. This consists of two Vicar Apostolics, Timoleon Raimondi and Dominic Pozzoni, and all five deceased bishops—Enrico Valtorta, Lorenzo Bianchi, Francis Hsu, Peter Lei and John Wu. Bianchi's remains were interred later than the others <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he was buried in Milan. Thus, the diocese had to apply for permission to allow for some of his remains to be transported back to Hong Kong; the request was eventually granted.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the quick}} {{shooting}} schedule, the rain forced several exterior scenes to be re-written to be shot inside.

The first scene shot was Beverly Garland and John Ireland's love scene in a tree. The tree was home to a colony of red ants, who crawled all over the actors and repeatedly bit them.|$|E

5|$|Due to this {{it often}} suffices to find {{representations}} of the Lie algebra.
