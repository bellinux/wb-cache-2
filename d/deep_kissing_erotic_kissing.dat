50|$|The Tao of Love and Sex (with {{foreword}} and postscript by Joseph Needham) interprets ancient Taoist sexual teachings into {{a modern}} model of sexuality. Beginning with a background of Tao and yin/yang, the book then goes into the following subjects: {{the role of women}} in sex, the importance of sexuality to health, ejaculation control, thrusting methods, descriptions of various sex positions, advantages of female superior positions, <b>erotic</b> <b>kissing</b> and the Tao, overcoming impotence, the importance of female satisfaction, longevity in relation to sexual health, benefits of age differences between sexual partners and breathing exercises.

50|$|Kissing: the {{touching}} of one person's lips {{against another}} person's {{can be regarded}} as a sexual act, especially <b>deep</b> <b>kissing</b> (French kissing) where one person inserts his tongue into the partner's mouth.

50|$|There is {{a general}} belief that one can be {{infected}} during the act of <b>deep</b> <b>kissing.</b> However, according to the doctor at the center, this is only possible if the uninfected person has a sore in the mouth or if that person swallows twenty liters of saliva of the infected person. Normal kissing usually does not carry those risks.|$|R
50|$|Since persons {{infected}} with KSHV will asymptomatically give the virus, caution {{should be used}} by sex partners in having unprotected sex and activities where saliva might be shared during sexual activity. Prudent advice is to use condoms when needed and avoid <b>deep</b> <b>kissing</b> with partners with KSHV and HIV infections or whose status is unknown.

5000|$|In Europe and North America, KSHV is {{transmitted}} through saliva. Thus, kissing is a theoretical {{risk factor for}} transmission. Higher rates of transmission among gay and bisexual men {{have been attributed to}} [...] "deep kissing" [...] sexual partners with KSHV. Another alternative theory suggests that use of saliva as a sexual lubricant might be a major mode for transmission. Prudent advice is to use commercial lubricants when needed and avoid <b>deep</b> <b>kissing</b> with partners with KSHV infection or whose status is unknown.|$|R
5000|$|In English {{informal}} speech, a French kiss, {{also known}} as a <b>deep</b> <b>kiss,</b> is an amorous kiss in which the participants' tongues extend to touch each other's lips or tongue. A [...] "kiss with the tongue" [...] stimulates the partner's lips, tongue and mouth, which are sensitive to the touch and induce physiological sexual arousal. The oral zone is one of the principal erogenous zones of the body. The implication is of a slow, passionate kiss which is considered intimate, romantic, erotic or sexual.|$|R

The leg then flees by jumping onto a passing skateboard, and ends up alone on a deserted beach. The arm finds her and they consummate their love with a <b>deep</b> <b>kiss.</b> The act of kissing causes the arm and leg to suddenly start swelling up and grow their extra body parts—they finally become complete, [...] "whole" [...] humans by realizing their love.|$|R
