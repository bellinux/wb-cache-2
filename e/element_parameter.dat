40|$|A unified {{approach}} has been proposed in the paper for processing unbalanced operating conditions in transient stability calculations. The suggested method combined advantages of both abc phase coordinates and 012 sequence coordinates. The former is used to describe faults since it is suitable to modeling simultaneous faults and the latter is used for time simulation for its sparse nature. Novel fault description and coordinate conversion formulation is presented. The equivalent positive sequence bus admittance matrix is derived for interface with generators in stability simulation. With the new method, the sequence network constitution can be avoided; multiple and simultaneous faults and <b>element</b> <b>parameter</b> unbalance can be simulated easily; and the sparse technology can still be applied for study efficiency.

40|$|The elastic {{parameters}} of soft tissues {{are important for}} medical diagnosis and virtual surgery simulation. In this study, we propose a novel nonlinear parameter estimation method for soft tissues. Firstly, an in-house data acquisition platform was used to obtain external forces and their corresponding deformation values. To provide highly precise data for estimating nonlinear parameters, the measured forces were corrected using the constructed weighted combination forecasting model based on a support vector machine (WCFM_SVM). Secondly, a tetrahedral finite <b>element</b> <b>parameter</b> estimation model was established to describe the physical characteristics of soft tissues, using the substitution {{parameters of}} Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio to avoid solving complicated nonlinear problems. To improve the robustness of our model and avoid poor local minima, the initial parameters solved by a linear finite element model were introduced into the parameter estimation model. Finally, a self-adapting Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) algorithm was presented, which is capable of adaptively adjusting iterative parameters to solve the established parameter estimation model. The maximum absolute error of our WCFM_SVM model was less than 0. 03  Newton, resulting in more accurate forces in comparison with other correction models tested. The maximum absolute error between the calculated and measured nodal displacements was less than 1. 5  mm, demonstrating that our nonlinear parameters are precise...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUNDThis study describes, {{electrochemically}} prepared Pt-nanoparticles (PtNP) embedded poly(pyrrole-co-pyrrolepropylic acid) (PPy-PPa) copolymer film over reduced graphene oxide (RGO) sheets {{deposited on}} a silane modified indium-tin-oxide coated glass plate. The cardiac myoglobin protein antibody (Ab-Mb) was covalently immobilized on PtNP(PPy-PPa) -RGO nanocomposite through pendant carboxyl {{groups of the}} polymer chain using carbodiimide coupling reaction to construct a bioelectrode. The bioelectrode was characterized by high resolution transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectra and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The sensing performance of the bioelectrode was investigated, as an impedimetric immunosensor, for the quantitative detection of the target human cardiac myoglobin antigen (Ag-cMb) in phosphate buffer silane (pH 7. 4). RESULTSThe EIS studies of the bioelectrode towards Ag-cMb showed a dominant charge transfer resistance (R-et) characteristic in the frequency region 50 to 100 Hz. The EIS of the bioelectrode showed an effective immunoreaction with Ag-cMb with {{a significant increase in}} both R-et and the constant phase <b>element</b> <b>parameter</b> (n) from 0. 61 to 0. 85. The bioelectrode exhibited a linear dynamic range of detection from 10 ngmL(- 1) to 1 mu gmL(- 1), sensitivity of 107. 08 cm(2) per decade and a lowest detection limit of 4. 0 ngmL(- 1) Ag-cMb. CONCLUSIONThe polymer nanocomposite with uniformly distributed PtNP in conjunction with conducting RGO support has been demonstrated to be a high performance immunosensor. This has been attributed to the synergistic combination of conducting RGO support and electroactive PtNP embedded conducting functional copolymer for efficient covalent biomolecular immobilization, responsible for high protein loading and fast interfacial electron exchange...|$|E
40|$|In the {{automotive}} industry many parts are connected with different types of clips. One of them is studied in this Master Thesis. The studied clip is of metal and used to connect plastic parts {{to each other in}} the interior of the cars. The aim is to find the mechanical properties of this clip joint at room temperature and 80 C and to implement in a simple connector element representing the clip joint. The properties in the clip connection are determined by use of a combination of component tests and simulations. The tests are performed by fastening one part in the clip connection and applying a displacement at the other part and measuring the force to get a force vs displacement relation. In the finite element simulations are the same loading case used. In the numerical simulations is also a sensitivity analysis performed to investigate what parameters affects the properties of the clip joint the most. The study gives linear stiffnesses perpendicular to the hole and around all axes. The frictional force when sliding along the hole occurs is determined. The forces needed to assemble and dis-assemble the clip joint are also determined. All these properties are determined both for room temperature and for 80 C. The determined properties are only valid until a specific displacement when the plastic parts come in contact. From the sensitivity study is concluded that the most important parameters are the hole size and thickness of the clip. The determined properties make it possible to include a more realistic behavior of the clip joint in simulations with clips. It is possible because the representation in the connector element still is simple but more realistic and prevents the number of degrees of freedom to increase drastically.

40|$|Engine {{development}} {{today is}} driven by cost, performance and government regulations. Customers want cars and trucks to consume less fuel, last longer, pollute less and be safer. Several of the requirements have tribological associations. For example, product longevity can be improved by lowering friction and using more wear-resistant components. In recent decades, the use of new coating application procedures and techniques has produced remarkably advances in relation to cutting tools. The process temperature at which coatings are applied has been lowered to below 200 oC. Thus {{it is now possible}} to coat low-alloy temper-sensitive steels, which are widely used in the automotive industry in machine elements such as gears, bearings and cam followers. The aim of this work has been to investigate the possibility of using sputtered amorphous carbon coatings to reduce friction and prevent wear in engine components, and specifically in valve train components. Test equipment simulating near-normal running conditions for the valve mechanism has been developed and used to test standard and coated valve components. The mechanism has also been analysed and simulated numerically. The results show a low velocity difference between the injector cam lobe and the roller, except for a short interval at the top dead centre of the rocker arm. In that region the slip increases significantly at higher speeds due to inertial forces. A three-dimensional finite <b>element</b> <b>parameter</b> study of the coating thickness, elastic modulus, asperity contact size and wavelength has shown that tensional stresses at the coating surface increase significantly when asperity contacts approach and interact. Testing of different thicknesses in rolling contact, together with finite element stress analysis, showed that a higher tensional stress level through the coating thickness increases the possibility of cracks propagating down to the interlayer and causing delamination of the coating. Tests with a rapid load increase on two carbon coatings show no transition from mild to more severe wear. Instead the contact is dimensioned by the plastic deformation of the underlying substrate...|$|E
40|$|Pipelines are an {{essential}} part of the oil and gas offshore industry, for transporting unprocessed oil and gas from the seabed to the oil platform and to the mainland. The unprocessed oil and gas leaves a corrosive environment, which sets a demand for pipes with a corrosion resistant interior. Clad pipes meet this demand with a corrosion resistant, stainless steel interior and an outer carbon steel layer. There is of today no repair contingency for clad pipes. A knowledge basis needs to be established and the risk of hydrogen induced stress cracking (HISC) must be found. This thesis work has been divided into two parts; One part working on experimentally testing of the triple point in welded clad pipes. Focused on fracture resistance curves, fracture toughness and crack path, with and without hydrogen present. The second part was focused on modelling a FE-model that was able to simulate crack propagation in clad pipe interface samples, experimentally tested by Jemblie. Both with and without hydrogen present during testing. Fracture mechanical testing of welded clad pipe C(T) samples have been successfully conducted, in air and under cathodic protection (CP). The samples with Ni-interlayer showed almost no reduction in fracture toughness from tests in air to tests under CP, with an average fracture toughness reduction of 0. 13 %. The small fracture toughness reduction may be explained by the crack path going into the Ni-interlayer which is not much susceptible to hydrogen embrittlement (HE). The samples without Ni-interlayer experienced a high decrease in fracture toughness tested under CP, with an average reduction in fracture toughness equal to 92 %. The crack path in the samples without Ni-interlayer was examined in a light optical microscope (LOM). The test done in air showed a crack path shifting between the base material and the clad. The crack propagated mainly in the clad in the sample tested under CP. Not enough samples were tested to establish the fracture resistance curves for the samples without Ni-interlayer. A 2 D FE-model with cohesive zone elements was successfully modelled. The FE-model was able to simulate crack propagation along the crack ligament, in a C(T) specimen, both with linear elastic and elastic-plastic materials. The FE-model was however not able to simulate the crack propagation observed in experimentally testing by Jemblie. This was not possible due to numerical problems occurring after a few cohesive elements had failed, when using sufficiently high cohesive <b>element</b> <b>parameter</b> values. For further work should more tests in both air and under CP be done on welded samples, with and without a Ni-interlayer. To establish the fracture resistance curves for both sample types. The microstructure on the samples without Ni-interlayer needs to be checked, to be sure that the samples are representative for welded clad pipes. The fractography must be studied and the cross section on multiply samples must be examined, on the samples without Ni-interlayer. To establish a more solid basis to explain the crack path and the hydrogen susceptibility on welded clad pipes. A deep root-cause investigation should be done on the FE-simulation, to explain and come up with a possible solution on the numerical crack propagation problem...|$|E
