40|$|For an endoreversible four-heat-reservoir {{absorption}} heat-transformer cycle, {{for which}} a linear (Newtonian) heat-transfer law applies, an <b>ecological</b> optimization <b>criterion</b> is proposed for the best mode of operation of the cycle. This involves maximizing a function representing the compromise between the heating load and the entropy-production rate. The optimal relation between the <b>ecological</b> <b>criterion</b> and the COP (coefficient of performance), the maximum <b>ecological</b> <b>criterion</b> and the corresponding COP, heating load and entropy production rate, {{as well as the}} <b>ecological</b> <b>criterion</b> and entropy-production rate at the maximum heating load are derived using finite-time thermodynamics. Moreover, compared with the heating-load criterion, the effects of the cycle parameters on the ecological performance are studied by numerical examples. These show that achieving the maximum <b>ecological</b> <b>criterion</b> makes the entropy-production rate decrease by 77. 0 % and the COP increase by 55. 4 % with only 27. 3 % heating-load losses compared with the maximum heating-load objective.

40|$|The {{specific}} way {{in which}} a forest road is designed affects the management in the forest environment and timber transport. The aim {{of this study was to}} find out whether an inclusion of the <b>ecological</b> <b>criterion</b> in the forest road design will change the parameter of the longitudinal gradient of forest hauling roads and whether these changes will have an effect on the accessibility of forest stands by timber hauling machinery. The possible changes in the longitudinal gradient can also affect the technology of forest road surfacing and the selection of the appropriate surface type. We can state that an inclusion of the <b>ecological</b> <b>criterion</b> in the forest road network design will bring statistically significant changes in longitudinal gradients of forest hauling roads. The mean longitudinal gradient of the current forest road network is 2. 82 [*]% and the mean longitudinal gradient of the forest road network designed with inclusion of the <b>ecological</b> <b>criterion</b> is 4. 82 [*]%. The results show statistically significant changes in the longitudinal parameters of forest hauling roads.

50|$|Mitigation {{regulations}} may {{not properly}} {{take into account}} the total ecological losses and gains associated with environmental impacts or mitigation when allocating debits and credits. Governing bodies are primarily responsible for prescribing the <b>ecological</b> <b>criteria</b> required to attain credits for mitigation. They are also responsible for valuation of credit. Therefore, it is evident that problems with the allocation and valuation of credits and debits might stem from the complexity of assessing the current comparative value of ecological resources (aka ecosystem services), ecosystem change over time, and/or a lack of understanding about what is beneficial or harmful to the environment overall. To address these uncertainties regulators often assign 'coverage ratios' to compensatory mitigation agreements. Coverage ratios of, for example, 3:1 require 3 compensatory mitigation credits for every 1 unit of ecological disturbance.|$|E

50|$|Chocolat Frey AG bases its {{understanding}} of sustainability on the three-pillar model. Sustainable development {{can only be}} achieved by considering economic, social and <b>ecological</b> <b>criteria</b> in equal measure and along the entire value chain. Since 2011 Chocolat Frey has acquired cocoa beans through the program of UTZ Certified, ensuring the compliance with social minimum standards and better wages for the cocoa farmers. Thanks to the utilisation of district heating instead of crude oil, respective structural measures, raising awareness and training of personnel as well as consistent controlling, energy consumption could be decreased by almost a quarter {{over the past few}} years, thus lowering the emission of CO2 significantly. In line with this, Frey was awarded ‘CO2-reduced company’ certification by the commercial environment agency for its voluntary endeavours in favour of climate protection. As a logical consequence, the company was awarded environmental certification according to ISO 14001 in 2008.|$|E
50|$|The first {{idea for}} the park came from the then Chief Executive of The Welding Institute (TWI Ltd) Bevan Braithwaite OBE.

A design team comprising Latz+Partner, a leading German landscape design company and Eric Parry Architects developed the master plan for the park in consideration of <b>ecological</b> <b>criteria</b> {{with the aim of}} preserving and enhancing the existing rural landscape and ensuring the site would be easily accessible. A joint partnership was formed between TWI Ltd and MEPC plc, and Granta Park Ltd was created.

Sun et al. examined the optimization {{of the relation between}} heating load and entropy production of the internal heating heat exchanger [8]. Chen et al. offered a model for the analysis of four-temperature-level absorption refrigerator cycles [9]. Chen and Yan made an optimization on the irreversible absorption heat exchangers for <b>ecological</b> <b>criterion</b> [10]. Yan and Chen [11] and Yan and Lin [12] optimized the three-temperature-level absorption cycles for the <b>ecological</b> <b>criterion</b> on the basis of energy and exergy output of the irreversible Carnot cycles. Fathi et al. offered a model for irreversible and solar absorption cooling [13]. In addition to these, except for the ones stated here, there are many performance optimization studies for absorption refrigerators [14, 15, 16, 17]. In addition, new optimization methods called ‘advanced exergy-based analysis methods’ [18, 19] or ‘exergy-entropy relationship’ [20] of the system can be investigated for the future studies. Contrary to other studies in which cooling load is the only evaluation criteria, this study aimed to provide maximum cooling load, minimum operation input, and minimum entropy production in the system. Due to this reason, a modified ecological function was presented. Considering the energy requirements of the world, {{the purpose of this study}} is to contribute to the more effective operation of absorption refrigerators by presenting a modified ecological function.|$|R
