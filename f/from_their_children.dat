5|$|In England, {{prior to}} the nineteenth century, common law {{considered}} children to be the property of their father. However, {{the economic and social}} changes that occurred during the nineteenth century lead to a shift in ideas about the dynamics of the family. Industrialization separated the home and the workplace, keeping fathers away <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> in order to earn wages and provide for their family. Conversely, mothers were expected to stay in the home and care for the household and the children. Important social changes such as women's suffrage and child development theories allowed for ideas surrounding the importance of maternal care.|$|E
5|$|Lynette and her husband, Tom (Doug Savant), {{have been}} keeping her cancer a secret <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> and friends. She wears a wig to hide her baldness from the chemotherapy. Muriel (Julia Campbell), an uptight PTA mother, nags Lynette to {{organize}} a school event, forcing Lynette to reveal her illness to everyone. After recovering from her suicide attempt, Edie discovers that Carlos has $10 million in an offshore bank account. She promises he can trust her with the secret, just as she can trust him not to break her heart. Meanwhile, Victor confronts Gabrielle about her unwillingness to sell her house and commit to their marriage. Dissatisfied with their relationships, Carlos and Gabrielle reignite an affair.|$|E
5|$|To the south, is the Croquet lawn, {{previously}} {{a tennis}} court – Lady Churchill was an accomplished and competitive player of both, although Churchill was not. Beyond the lawn {{are a number of}} structures grouped around the Victorian kitchen garden, many of which Churchill was involved in building. He had developed an interest in bricklaying when he bought Chartwell and throughout the 1920s and 1930s constructed walls, a summerhouse and a number of houses on the estate. In 1928 he joined the Amalgamated Union of Building Trade Workers, a move which caused some controversy. Near the kitchen garden are the Golden Rose walk, a Golden Wedding anniversary present to the Churchills <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> in 1958, and Churchill's painting studio, constructed in the 1930s, which now houses a large collection of his artistic works.|$|E

25|$|Infants whose {{mothers are}} more {{sensitive}} {{are more likely to}} display secure attachment relationships. Because the maternal figure is generally accessible and responsive to the infant's needs, the infant is able to form expectations of the mother's behaviour. Once expectations are met and the infant feels a consistency in the mother's sensitivity, the infant is able to find security in the maternal figure. Those infants whose mothers do not respond to the signals <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> or respond inappropriately to their children's cries for attention will form insecure and anxious attachments because the infants are unable to consistently depend on the maternal figures for predictable and safe responses.|$|E
25|$|Japanese-Canadian {{women and}} {{children}} faced {{a specific set of}} challenges that greatly affected their way of life and broke down the social and cultural norms that had developed. Whole families were taken from their homes and separated from each other. Husbands and wives were almost always separated when sent to camps and, less commonly, some mothers were separated <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> as well. Japanese-Canadian families typically had a patriarchal structure, meaning the husband was the centre of the family. Since husbands were often separated from their families, wives were left to reconfigure the structure of the family and the long established divisions of labour that were so common in the Japanese-Canadian household.|$|E

[...] Most of the 4- and 5-year-olds understood that Big Bird and the adults were sad. [...] Most children (80%) were attentive during the episode.

500|$|When {{assessing}} Lady Rosebery's behaviour to {{her children}} {{it should be remembered}} that she lived in an era of plentiful nannies, wet nurses, nursemaids and governesses which the upper classes employed as the norm. These people were employed regardless of the mother's affection towards her children; it was inconceivable that a countess would nurse her own children, and to do so would have been breaking social conventions. Hence her seeming lack of attention {{to her children}} was not unusual– she was following the upper class conventions and [...] "stiff upper lip" [...] philosophies of her era. However, in spite of their prolonged absences <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> the Roseberys do not appear to have been very distant or remote figures in the earliest stages of their children's lives. Margot Asquith records how Rosebery loved to play and romp on the floor with the children.|$|E
2500|$|Unwed {{single women}} who became {{pregnant}} {{were sent to}} give birth there, rather than at a hospital or at home. The nuns were trained nurses and midwives. [...] In 1927, the Board of Health directed that a maternity ward {{be added to the}} Home so that the mothers could be segregated from the public wards. This was built in 1929. The mothers were required to stay inside the Home for one year, doing unpaid work for the nuns, as reimbursement for some of the services rendered. They were separated <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> who remained separately in the Home, raised by nuns, until they could be adopted - often without consent.|$|E
2500|$|Ten {{days before}} he died, Lindbergh wrote to each of his European mistresses, imploring them to {{maintain}} the utmost secrecy about his illicit activities with them even after his death. The three women (none of whom ever married) all managed to keep their affairs secret even <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>children,</b> who during his lifetime (and {{for almost a decade}} after his death) did not know the true identity of their father, whom they had only known by the alias Careu Kent and they had only seen him when he briefly visited them once or twice per year. However, after reading a magazine article about Lindbergh in the mid-1980s, Brigitte's daughter Astrid deduced the truth; she later discovered snapshots and more than 150 love letters from Lindbergh to Brigitte. After Brigitte and Anne Lindbergh had both died, she made her findings public; in 2003 DNA tests confirmed that Lindbergh had fathered Astrid and her two siblings. Reeve Lindbergh, Lindbergh's youngest child with Anne, wrote in her personal journal in 2003, [...] "This story reflects absolutely Byzantine layers of deception on the part of our shared father. These children did not even know who he was! He used a pseudonym with them (To protect them, perhaps? To protect himself, absolutely!)" ...|$|E

2500|$|Almost {{three weeks}} after his birth, on August 19, Herman Melville was baptized at home by a {{minister}} of the South Reformed Dutch Church. During the 1820s, Melville lived a privileged, opulent life, in a household with three or more servants at a time. At four-year intervals, the family would move to more spacious and elegant quarters, finally settling on Broadway in 1828. Allan Melvill lived beyond his means and on large sums he borrowed from both {{his father and his}} wife's widowed mother. His wife's opinion of his financial conduct is unknown. Biographer Hershel Parker suggests Maria [...] "thought her mother's money was infinite and that she was entitled to much of her portion now, while she had small children." [...] How well, biographer Delbanco adds, the parents managed to hide the truth <b>from</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> is [...] "impossible to kno." [...] In 1830, Maria's family finally lost patience and their support came to a halt, at which point Allan's total debt to both families exceeded $20,000. The felicity of Melville's early childhood, biographer Newton Arvin writes, depended not so much on wealth as on the [...] "exceptionally tender and affectionate spirit in all the family relationships, especially in the immediate circle." [...] Arvin describes Allan as [...] "a man of real sensibility and a particularly warm and loving father," [...] while Maria was [...] "warmly maternal, simple, robust, and affectionately devoted to her husband and her brood." ...|$|E
