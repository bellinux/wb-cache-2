40|$|New {{individual}} equipment design begins with {{analysis of the}} {{need in order to}} determine equipment's relationships with its outerspace (including the user himself), transform these relationships into functions, determine their nature (service, strain, etc [...] .). The characterization of the technical functions must be performed in agreement with physiological functions concerned by the equipment. This leads to need in hierarchization, i. e. classification according to importance. If this is not done, requirements of the technical specifications may generate functional conflicts, inconsistents with user's efficiency and health. We propose an approach which allows to solve such conflicts for the design of a new chemical protective mask Its aim is to go far further than simple classical Human Factor approach and to formalize implicated functions hierarchization, thus simpliJYjng <b>dimensionning</b> and integration of design technical factors.

40|$|In this paper, we {{deal with}} the fixed {{frequency}} assignment problem, using for this purpose the classical theoretical cellular model. We give a simple randomized algorithm, based on the construction of a solution using a "dynamic" tree. Then, performances of this algorithm are evaluated with those obtained by well-known heuristics in terms of quality solutions and computation time. 1 Introduction The design of a cellular network can be decomposed into three main parts: network <b>dimensionning</b> (taking into account the traffic distribution and a model of subscribers), simulations of radio coverage and frequency assignment. This frequency assignment has to take into account traffic distribution, radio environment and a given quality of service. The operator must therefore assign frequencies to each base station {{in a way that the}} cochannel and adjacent interference levels do never reach a given threshold. From a theoretical point of view, the frequency assignment problem is a NP-complete opt [...] ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{acoustical}} macro-behaviour {{of mineral}} open-cell foam samples is modelled from microstructure morphology using a three-dimensional idealized periodic unit-cell (3 D-PUC). The 3 D-PUC {{is based on}} a regular arrangement of spheres, allowed to interpenetrate during the foaming process. Identification and <b>dimensionning</b> of the 3 D-PUC is made from X-ray computed microtomography and fabrication process information. In addition, the 3 D-PUC used allows to account for two scales of porosity: the interconnected network of bubbles (meso-porosity) and the inter-crystalline porosity of a gypsum matrix (micro-porosity). Transport properties of the micro- and the meso- scales are calculated from first principles and a hybrid micro-macro method is used {{in order to determine the}} frequency-dependent visco-thermal dissipation properties. The double porosity theory provides the visco-thermal coupling between the meso- and micro- scales [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 114, 73  89 (2003) ]. Finally, the results are successfully compared with experiments for two different mineral foam samples. The main originality of this work is to maintain a direct link between the microstructure morphology and the acoustical macro-behaviour all along the multi-scale modelling process, without any fitted parameter...|$|E

5000|$|In mathematics, {{effective}} <b>dimension</b> is {{a modification}} of Hausdorff <b>dimension</b> and other fractal <b>dimensions</b> which places it in a computability theory setting. There are several variations (various notions of effective <b>dimension)</b> of which the most common is effective Hausdorff <b>dimension.</b> <b>Dimension,</b> in mathematics, is a particular way of describing {{the size of an}} object (contrasting with measure and other, different, notions of size). Hausdorff <b>dimension</b> generalizes the well-known integer <b>dimensions</b> assigned to points, lines, planes, etc. by allowing one to distinguish between objects of intermediate size between these integer-dimensional objects. For example, fractal subsets of the plane may have intermediate <b>dimension</b> between 1 and 2, as they are [...] "larger" [...] than lines or curves, and yet [...] "smaller" [...] than filled circles or rectangles. Effective <b>dimension</b> modifies Hausdorff <b>dimension</b> by requiring that objects with small effective <b>dimension</b> be not only small but also locatable (or partially locatable) in a computable sense. As such, objects with large Hausdorff <b>dimension</b> also have large effective <b>dimension,</b> and objects with small effective <b>dimension</b> have small Hausdorff <b>dimension,</b> but an object can have small Hausdorff but large effective <b>dimension.</b> An example is an algorithmically random point on a line, which has Hausdorff <b>dimension</b> 0 (since it is a point) but effective <b>dimension</b> 1 (because, roughly speaking, it can't be effectively localized any better than a small interval, which has Hausdorff <b>dimension</b> 1).|$|R

This thesis focuses on Gorenstein <b>dimensions</b> for modules and for complexes. ^ In Chapter 1, we introduce and study a new homological <b>dimension</b> called upper Gorenstein <b>dimension.</b> It is modeled on the complete intersection <b>dimension</b> and has parallel properties. We show that this new <b>dimension</b> sits between Gorenstein <b>dimension</b> and complete intersection <b>dimension</b> and if one of these <b>dimensions</b> is finite, then it is equal to those to its left. ^ We also construct families of modules for which strict inequality is obtained between various homological <b>dimensions.</b> By finding a module for which lower complete intersection <b>dimension</b> is strictly less than the complete intersection <b>dimension,</b> we answer a question of Gerko. ^ In Chapter 2, we introduce and study a notion of Gorenstein projective <b>dimension</b> for arbitrary complexes of left modules over an associative ring. It specializes to Gorenstein projective <b>dimension</b> of Enochs and Jenda for left modules over an associative ring and to the Gorenstein projective <b>dimension</b> of Christensen for complexes with bounded below homology.
