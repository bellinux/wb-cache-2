The Finns made two counteroffers—the first on 23 October and the second on 3 November. In both offers Finland would cede the Terijoki area to the Soviet Union, which was {{far less than the}} Soviets had demanded. The Finnish delegation returned home on November 13, taking <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> <b>that</b> the negotiations would continue in the future.|$|E

McKinney instantly became the favorite in the House Democratic primary.

For example, while it calls for both conservatives and liberals to apologise for disunity, it acknowledges that the conservatives may have acted {{out of a sense}} of duty.

25|$|To {{believe in}} God means to accept {{life on the}} {{assumption}} that it harbors conditions in the outer world and drives in the human spirit which together impel man to transcend himself. To believe in God means to take <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> <b>that</b> it is man's destiny to rise above the brute and to eliminate all forms of violence and exploitation from human society. In brief, God is the Power in the cosmos that gives human life the direction that enables the human being to reflect the image of God.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{conventional}} International Date Line {{is a relatively}} recent geographic and political construct whose exact location has moved {{from time to time}} depending on the needs of different interested parties.

25|$|A {{number of}} {{traditional}} {{attitudes toward the}} family have survived without being questioned. It is taken <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> <b>that</b> everyone should marry, and marriage remains part {{of the definition of}} normal adult status. Marriage is expected to be permanent. That marriage requires a woman to move into her husband's family and to become a daughter-in-law as well as a wife is still largely accepted. The norm of patrilineal descent and the assumption that it is sons who bear the primary responsibility for their aged parents remain. The party and government have devoted great effort to controlling the number of births and have attempted {{to limit the number of}} children per couple. But the authorities have not attempted to control population growth by suggesting that some people should not marry at all.|$|E

50|$|Payne {{realized}} that her only career option in the U.K. {{was to become a}} teacher, so she looked <b>for</b> <b>grants</b> <b>that</b> would enable her to move to the United States. After being introduced to Harlow Shapley, the Director of the Harvard College Observatory, who had just begun a graduate program in astronomy, she left England in 1923. This was made possible by a fellowship to encourage women to study at the observatory. The first student on the fellowship was Adelaide Ames (1922) and the second was Payne.|$|R
25|$|While Hall {{was very}} {{conservative}} even by Texas Democratic standards, his conservatism {{can be attributed}} to the demographics of the 4th District. It had once been reliably Democratic, but became increasingly friendly to Republicans as Dallas' suburban growth spilled into the western portion of the district. The 4th has not supported the Democratic nominee for president since 1964. Despite this district's increasingly Republican tilt, Hall won 10 more terms as a member of the Democratic Party with an average of 60% of the vote. In 1994, for instance, he was re-elected by a 19-point margin, even as other conservative Democratic congressmen lost their seats. By the 1990s, he was the only elected Democratic official above the county level in much of the district. It was taken <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> <b>that</b> he would be succeeded by a Republican once he retired.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} noted that the {{procedures}} described in the Mishnah and Tosefta are all plausible procedures for regulating an empirical lunar calendar. Fire-signals, for example, or smoke-signals, are known from the pre-exilic Lachish ostraca. Furthermore, the Mishnah contains laws that reflect the uncertainties of an empirical calendar. Mishnah Sanhedrin, for example, holds that when one witness holds that an event took place on a certain day of the month, and another that the same event {{took place on the}} following day, their testimony can be held to agree, since the length of the preceding month was uncertain. Another Mishnah takes it <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> <b>that</b> it cannot be known in advance whether a year's lease is for twelve or thirteen months. Hence it is a reasonable conclusion that the Mishnaic calendar was actually used in the Mishnaic period.|$|E
25|$|By {{the start}} of 1984, as Mulroney began {{learning}} the realities of parliamentary life in the House of Commons, the Tories took a substantial lead in opinion polling. It was almost taken <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> <b>that</b> Trudeau would be heavily defeated by Mulroney {{in the general election}} due no later than 1985. Trudeau announced his retirement in February, and the Liberal Party chose John Turner, previously the Minister of Finance under Trudeau in the 1970s, as its new leader. The Liberals then surged in the polls, to take a lead, after trailing by more than 20 percentage points. Only four days after being sworn in as Prime Minister, Turner called a general election for September. In so doing, he had to postpone a planned Canadian summer visit by Queen Elizabeth II, who makes it her policy to not travel abroad during foreign election campaigns. But the Liberal election campaign machinery was in disarray, leading to a weak campaign.|$|E

25|$|In Chullin 92a-b Ulla {{says that}} here are 30 laws which {{the sons of}} Noah took upon themselves. However he only lists three, namely the three that the Gentiles follow: not to create a Ketubah between males, not to sell carrion {{in the market and}} to respect the Torah. The rest of the laws are not listed. Talmud {{commentator}} Rashi remarks on this that he does not know the other Commandments that are referred to. Though the authorities seem to take it <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> <b>that</b> Ulla's thirty commandments included the original seven, an additional thirty laws is also possible from the reading. Two different lists of the 30 laws exist. Both lists include an additional twenty-three mitzvot which are subdivisions or extensions of the seven laws. One from the 16th-century work Asarah Maamarot by Rabbi Menahem Azariah da Fano and a second from the 10th century Samuel ben Hofni which was recently published from his Judeo-Arabic writings after having been found in the Cairo Geniza. Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Chajes suggests Menahem Azariah of Fano enumerated commandments are not related to the first seven, nor based on Scripture, but instead were passed down by oral tradition.|$|E
25|$|Howard Robinson is {{a philosopher}} who has {{concentrated}} his research within {{the philosophy of}} mind. Taking what has been through {{the latter part of}} the last century an unfashionable stance, he has consistently argued against those explanations of sensory experience that would reduce them to physical origins. He has never regarded the theory of sense-data as refuted, but has set out to refute in turn the objections which so many have considered to be conclusive. The version of the theory of sense-data he defends takes what is before consciousness in perception to be qualia as mental presentations that are causally linked to external entities, but which are not physical in themselves. Unlike the philosophers so far mentioned, he is therefore a dualist, one who takes both matter and mind to have real and metaphysically distinct natures. His books (particularly Matter and Sense and Perception) are characterized by the thoroughness with which he deals with the arguments of opposing philosophers, thus setting a professional example that it would be well for his opponents to follow (for there has been a tendency to take <b>for</b> <b>granted</b> <b>that</b> the theory of sense-data is wholly obsolescent). In one of his most recent articles he takes the physicalist to task for ignoring the fact that sensory experience can be entirely free of representational character. He cites phosphenes as a stubborn example (phosphenes are flashes of neural light that result either from sudden pressure in the brain—as induced, for example, by intense coughing, or through direct physical pressure on the retina), and points out that it is grossly counter-intuitive to argue that these are not visual experiences on a par with open-eye seeing.|$|E
