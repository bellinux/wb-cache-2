50|$|The IBEX 35 is a capitalization-weighted index. The {{market cap}} used to {{calculate}} the weighting of each constituent is multiplied by a free float factor (ranging from 0.1 to 1) depending on the <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> not subject to block ownership. Any company with 50% or more of its shares considered free float is given a free float factor of 1. Unlike many other European benchmark indices, the weightings of companies in the IBEX 35 are not capped.|$|E
50|$|Institutional {{ownership}} ranging between 5% and 65% - Institutional {{investors are}} organizations that trade {{large volumes of}} securities. Percentage institutional ownership is the <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> outstanding owned by mutual funds, pension plans and other institutional investors. Most well-known stocks have at least 40% institutional ownership. Usually more than 70% of daily trading on the New York Stock Exchange is from institutional investors. Peter Lynch, among many other investors, uses institutional ownership to gauge market interest. He believes stocks with low institutional ownership have the best return potential. When mainstream Wall Street analysts identify a stock, price growth can be dramatic {{with the support of}} institutional money. Lower levels can be associated with greater price volatility.|$|E
50|$|The PSI-20 is a capitalization-weighted index. The market {{capitalisation}} {{used to calculate}} the weightings of each stock is the so-called free-float band adjusted market cap, where the free float factor (<b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> actively available for trade on Euronext Lisbon) is rounded up to the nearest 5%. The weightings of companies in the index were capped (if necessary) at 20% at each semi-annual review prior to the July 2007 rule change, when the capping limit was cut to 15% in line with Euronext's other benchmark national indexes. Weights are allowed to fluctuate freely after index changes are made, but are capped once again at the next reclassification. The capping factors used to scale down the weightings of the largest companies are recalculated each year at the index review.|$|E
40|$|Privatization is the {{transferring}} {{of ownership}} {{from state to}} private ownership expecting that the lackluster and unsatisfactory performance of state-owned enterprises can be improved. This study was focuses on the evaluation of operating and financial performances of the privatized firms which issued shares in capital market. The research {{was carried out by}} investigating the performance of the firms after privatization, and evaluating the performance of initial public offerings (IPOs) on the short-run and the long-run. The performance were studied through statistical analysis of the dependency of several independent variables namely performance proxies i. e. soft budget constraint, <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>share</b> sold, share allocated to employee and top management team change on dependent variables i. e. return on sales (ROS), return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE), real sale and net income. Several factors associated with the variation in initial returns such as percentage <b>of</b> <b>share</b> sold, uncertainty about the future firm value, market index fluctuation prior to the issue, size of firm and the value of issue {{on the first day of}} trading were analyzed statistically to evaluate the short-run and the long-run performances. The results showed that the performance proxies ROS, ROA and ROE deteriorated and real sales and net profit of the firms improved upon privatization. The factors that are responsible to the performance changes differ depending on the performance proxies. The factors responsible for ROS are the short-term debt to total asset and the share allocated to employee, the <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>share</b> sold and the share allocated to employee are responsible for ROA, while the ROE is affected by the top management team change only. The real sale is influenced by the <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>share</b> sold and the share allocated to employee, while net profit is not affected by any factor considered in this study...|$|R

40|$|Motivation: Most prokaryotic genomes are {{circular}} with {{a single}} chromosome (called circular genomes), which consist of bacteria and archaea. Orthologous genes (abbreviated as orthologs) are genes directly evolved from an ancestor gene, and can be traced through different species in evolution. Shared orthologs between bacterial genomes {{have been used to}} measure their genome evolution. Here, organization of circular genomes is analyzed via distributions <b>of</b> <b>shared</b> orthologs between genomes. However, these distributions are often asymmetric and bimodal; to date, there is no joint distribution to model such data.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the dynamics}} of a Cournot duopoly under cross-ownership participation when players have heterogeneous, i. e. bounded rational and naïve, expectations. We find that when the shareholder that owns firm also holds a percentage of firm, the parametric stability region of the unique Cournot-Nash equilibrium is larger than when every firm is owned by a unique shareholder, {{and an increase in}} the <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> that the shareholder that owns firm has in firm tends to stabilise the market equilibrium. Moreover, when products are (horizontally) differentiated, a rise in the <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> of firm held by the shareholder that owns firm acts as an economic (de) stabiliser when products of variety and are (complements) substitutes between each other. The policy implication is that, despite on the one hand, cross-ownership acts as an anti-competitive device that indeed tends to reduce social welfare with the corresponding anti-trust consequences, on the other hand, it acts as an economic stabiliser (except when products are complements). ...|$|E

40|$|AFLP is a DNA {{fingerprinting}} technique {{frequently used}} in the plant sciences. The resulting profile for an individual plant {{is a sort of}} barcode of bands, resulting from the separation of DNA fragments by length on an electrophoretic gel. This barcode is often represented as a binary vector, indicating absence or presence of bands. AFLP is used e. g. in phylogenetic studies to estimate the pairwise genetic similarity of individuals (from different species or accessions). We interpret pairwise genetic similarity as the <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> DNA <b>shared</b> by two individuals, amount-ing to the <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>shared</b> DNA fragments {{in the case of the}} AFLP procedure. This genetic similarity is usually estimated by the Dice (or Jaccard) coefficient, calculated from the pair of binary band vectors of the two individuals. In this study we focus on two problems in the interpretation of AFLP profiles. 1) Within a pro-file two or more fragments of the same length but of different genomic origin may have been formed, which collide into a single band. We call this collision, see Gort (2006) and Gort (2008). 2) In a pair of profiles two fragments of the same length but, again, of different genomic origin may have been formed, appearing as identical bands in the two profiles.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between divergence of opinion and the cross-sectional stock returns in Chinese A share market where short-selling of stocks is prohibited by law. Using a proxy for divergence of opinion among the entire investor base, we document a positive relationship between divergent beliefs and future stock returns. This is in sharp contrast to Miller 2 ̆ 7 s (1977) prediction of a negative relationship between the two. The result is likely to be driven by the dominance of individual investors and their speculative trading behaviors in China. Miller 2 ̆ 7 s prediction is confirmed when divergence of opinion is measured using data on mutual fund holdings. Our results are robust to a number of common return predictors. We also find a significantly negative relationship between the <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> tradable <b>shares</b> in listed Chinese companies and future stock returns.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{explanation}} for two empirical puzzles surrounding initial public offerings (IPOs). Firstly, it is well documented that IPO underpricing increases during “hot issue” periods. Secondly, venture capital (VC) backed IPOs are less underpriced than non-venture capital backed IPOs during normal periods of activity, but {{the reverse is true}} during hot issue periods: VC backed IPOs are more underpriced than non-VC backed ones. This paper shows that when IPOs are driven by the initial investor’s desire to exit from an existing investment in order to finance a new venture, both the value of the new venture and the value of the existing firm to be sold in the IPO drive the investor’s choice of price and <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> sold in the IPO. When this is the case, the availability of attractive new ventures increases equilibrium underpricing, which is what we observe during hot issue periods. Moreover, I show that underpricing is affected by the severity of the moral hazard problem between an investor and the firm’s manager. In the presence of a moral hazard problem the degree of equilibrium underpricing is more sensitive to changes {{in the value of the}} new venture. This can explain why venture capitalists, who often finance firms with more severe moral hazard problems, underprice IPOs less in normal periods, but underprice more strongly during hot issue periods. Further empirical implications relating the <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> sold and the degree of underpricing are presented...|$|E

In a sample of 1, 948 IPOs, we find support for the notion that lock-ups serve as commitment mechanisms {{at the time of the}} IPO.

40|$|A {{common theme}} in the {{literature}} on corporate control is that, when share ownership is diffuse, the free-rider problem prevents raiders from making acquisitions at tender prices below the postacquisition share price. In this paper, we address this question by formulating a nonstandard model of takeovers of diffusely held firms. It is demonstrated that, even when individual shareholdings are infinitesimal relative to firm size, takeovers succeed with positive probability and equilibria exist in which the raider earns substantial per share profits. Further, the Nash equilibria of the game are characterized with regard to raider profit, the aggregate <b>fraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> tendered, and the relation between raider profit and the degree of randomization exhibited by shareholder tendering strategies.

The Schmidt modes that we explicitly derive allow one {{to set up an}} optimised projection basis that maximises the mutual information gained from a joint measurement.
