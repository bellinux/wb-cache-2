5|$|I never agreed, {{even as a}} young person, {{with the}} Thomas Wolfe title You Can't <b>Go</b> <b>Home</b> <b>Again.</b> Instinctively I didn’t. But the truth is, you can never leave home. You take it with you; it’s under your fingernails; it’s in the hair follicles; it’s {{in the way you}} smile; it’s in the ride of your hips, in the passage of your breasts; it’s all there, no matter where you go. You can take on the affectations and the postures of other places and even learn to speak their ways. But the truth is, home is between your teeth.|$|E
500|$|The Chicago Tribune Michael Phillips wrote, [...] "Up in the Air is a slickly crafted disappointment. [...] feels {{tailor-made}} for George Clooney, {{who is very}} good. But the stakes remain frustratingly low and it's one of those contemporary middlebrow projects that asks us to root for a genial, shallow individual as he learns {{to be a little}} less the man he was." [...] Julian Sancton of Vanity Fair wrote, [...] "There are two movies in Up in the Air: one about a guy who's flying around the country firing people, and one about a commitment-phobe who's flying away from responsibility and a shot at true love, as embodied by Farmiga. There is no attempt to braid these two threads together, and that's where the movie feels unsatisfying." [...] J. Hoberman of The Village Voice wrote, [...] "Like Juno, Up in the Air conjures a troubling reality and then wishes it away. The filmmakers have peeked into the abyss and averted their eyes... warns that you can't <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>again</b> – and then, full of false cheer and false consciousness, pretends you can." ...|$|E

2500|$|The English now {{decided that}} the Dutch had gone too far, and intervened in their turn by sending a fleet to oppose the Dutch, and shore up Swedish determination. Reluctantly (because they did not relish another hot war with the Commonwealth) the States General called this bluff, by sending a second fleet, {{under the command of}} De Ruyter, in the Summer of 1659. The {{combined}} Dutch fleets, 78 ships and 17,000 men, anchored provocatively in the Sound close to the combined Anglo-Swedish fleet. After [...] some brooding staring from both sides, the English decided to <b>go</b> <b>home</b> <b>again.</b> The Dutch then proceeded by ejecting the Swedes from Nyborg, making the Swedish position untenable. Charles now sued for peace. He agreed to give up his conquests in Denmark, and to retract a number of protectionist measures against Dutch shipping.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{was just}} {{thinking}} what a fool I was to come at all, {{and that it is}} almost time I <b>went</b> <b>home</b> <b>again.</b> When a man has had tropical fever it is his own fault if he suffers from indulgence in amusements of this description." ...|$|R
