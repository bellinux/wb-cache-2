40|$|AbstractThis study aims to {{calculate}} the maximum spanning lengths of different size <b>High</b> <b>Density</b> <b>Polyethylene</b> pipes (<b>HDPE)</b> at the intermediate zone of coastal environments. In order to do so, Reynolds number less than 3. 5 × 105 and Keulegan Carpenter number between 4 and 7 at intermediate depth are accepted as {{the limitations of the}} work. The assigned limitations were useful to analyse the behaviour of submerged pipes in the absence of vortex induced vibration. Therefore, the velocity of sea current and the wave orbital velocity at intermediate depth are computed to determine the in-line and cross-flow net forces acting on spanning submerged pipes. Finally, comparing the yield stresses of pipes with the bending stresses due to external forces, the critical spanning length of <b>high</b> <b>density</b> <b>polyethylene</b> pipes are deduced. At constant diameter, the free spanning length of the pipes was increasing as the wall thickness of the pipes increases.

Microbiological stability evaluation was based on mesophilic and psychrotrophic counts. Sensory shelf-life was estimated according to the ratings assigned to the attributes appearance, aroma, flavor and overall appreciation of milk samples. The pasteurization temperature, in the range investigated, did not affect the shelf-life of milk, which lasted up to 11 days for the three processed batches.

Two lots of 300 units each were processed, respectively, at 135 and 141 degrees C/ 10 s using indirect heating and subsequently aseptically filled in an ISO class 7 clean room. These experimental lots were evaluated for appearance, aroma, flavor, and overall appreciation and compared to samples of commercial UHT milk purchased from local commercial stores. The time-temperature combinations investigated did not affect either the acceptability or the shelf life of the milk. Despite the limited light barrier properties of HDPE bottles, the product contained in the package tested exhibited good stability, with a shelf life ranging from 4 to 11 wk. Within this time period, the acceptability of the experimental lots was similar to that of the commercial products.

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that <b>high</b> <b>density</b> <b>polyethylene</b> pipe (<b>HDPE)</b> performs well under live loads with shallow cover, provided the backfill is well compacted. Although industry standards require carefully compacted backfill, poor inspection and/or faulty construction {{may result in}} soils that provide inadequate restraint at the springlines of the pipes thereby causing failure. The objectives of this study were: 1) to experimentally define a lower limit of compaction under which the pipes perform satisfactorily, 2) to quantify the increase in soil support as compaction effort increases, 3) to evaluate pipe response for loads applied near {{the ends of the}} buried pipes, 4) to determine minimum depths of cover for a variety of pipes and soil conditions by analytically expanding the experimental results through the use of the finite element program CANDE. The test procedures used here are conservative especially for low-density fills loaded to high contact stresses. The failures observed in these tests were the combined effect of soil bearing capacity at the soil surface and localized wall bending of the pipes.

By using the flotation method, generally two fractions are obtained from municipal post-consumer wastes: a light fraction, floating on water, {{and a heavy}} fraction. The former is essentially made of low and <b>high</b> <b>density</b> <b>polyethylene</b> - LDPE, <b>HDPE</b> - and polypropylene - PP, the heavy fraction is formed by poly(vinyl chloride) PVC - and poly(ethylene terephthalate) - PET. In this work, the recycling of a light fraction from municipal post-consumer plastics has been studied, considering also the effect of filler type - glass fibres, calcium carbonate and wood fibres - and processing apparatus - discountinous mixer, single and twin screw extruder - on the properties. Although the similar chemical nature of the two main components, polyethylene and polypropylene of the light fraction, the mechanical properties of the recycled mixture are quite scarce, {{mainly because of the}} incompatibility and the possible presence of some heterogeneous particles. The recycling of the light fraction can significantly change the properties of the polymer system because of the thermomechanical stress and of the residence time during processing. The adding of the three fillers type leads to an increase of the thermomechanical and of some of the mechanical properties. The elastic modulus increases with the three fillers, in particular, glass fibres show the best results. The effect of the three fillers is quite similar for tensile strength, elongation at break and impact strength. The adding of inert filler strongly improves the rigidity of light fraction from municipal post-consumer plastics. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|It {{was found}} in this study, that {{ionizing}} beta radiation has {{a positive effect on}} the mechanical properties of poly(ethylene). In recent years, there have been increasing requirements for quality and cost effectiveness of manufactured products in all areas of industrial production. These requirements are best met with the polymeric materials, which have many advantages in comparison to traditional materials. The main advantages of polymer materials are especially in their ease of processability, availability, and price of the raw materials. Radiation crosslinking is one of the ways to give the conventional plastics mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties of expensive and highly resistant construction polymers. Several types of ionizing radiation are used for crosslinking of polymers. Each of them has special characteristics. Electron beta and photon gamma radiation are used the most frequently. The great advantage is that the crosslinking occurs after the manufacturing process at normal temperature and pressure. The main purpose of this paper has been to determine the effect of ionizing beta radiation on the tensile modulus, strength and elongation of low and <b>high</b> <b>density</b> <b>polyethylene</b> (LDPE and <b>HDPE).</b> These properties were examined in dependence on the dosage of the ionizing beta radiation (non-irradiated samples and those irradiated by dosage 99 kGy were compared) and on the test temperature. Radiation cross-linking of LDPE and HDPE results in increased tensile strength and modulus, and decreased of elongation. The measured results indicate that ionizing beta radiation treatment is effective tool for improvement of mechanical properties of LDPE and HDPE under thermal stress.
