25|$|Pre-processing helped {{enhancing}} {{the quality of}} an image by filtering and removing unnecessary noises. The minutiae based algorithm only worked effectively in 8-bit gray scale <b>fingerprint</b> <b>image.</b> A reason was that an 8-bit gray <b>fingerprint</b> <b>image</b> was a fundamental base to convert the image to 1-bit image with value 0 for ridges and value 1 for furrows. As a result, the ridges were highlighted with black color while the furrows were highlighted with white color. This process partly removed some noises in an image and helped enhance the edge detection. Furthermore, there are two more steps to improve the best quality for the input image: minutiae extraction and false minutiae removal. The minutiae extraction {{was carried out by}} applying ridge thinning algorithm which was to remove redundant pixels of ridges. As a result, the thinned ridges of the <b>fingerprint</b> <b>image</b> are marked with a unique ID so that further operation can be conducted. After the minutiae extraction step, the false minutiae removal was also necessary. The lack of the amount of ink and the cross link among the ridges could cause false minutiae that led to inaccuracy in fingerprint recognition process.|$|E

However, the most popular algorithm was minutiae based matching algorithm due to its efficiency and accuracy.|$|E
25|$|All the {{proposed}} methods can be grouped into two major families: solid-state fingerprint readers and optical fingerprint readers. The procedure for capturing a fingerprint using a sensor consists of rolling or touching with the finger onto a sensing area, {{which according to}} the physical principle in use (optical, ultrasonic, capacitive or thermal) captures the difference between valleys and ridges. When a finger touches or rolls onto a surface, the elastic skin deforms. The quantity {{and direction of the}} pressure applied by the user, the skin conditions and the projection of an irregular 3D object (the finger) onto a 2D flat plane introduce distortions, noise and inconsistencies in the captured <b>fingerprint</b> <b>image.</b> These problems result in inconsistent and non-uniform irregularities in the image. During each acquisition, therefore, the results of the imaging are different and uncontrollable. The representation of the same fingerprint changes every time the finger is placed on the sensor plate, increasing the complexity of any attempt to match fingerprints, impairing the system performance and consequently, limiting the widespread use of this biometric technology.|$|E
