5|$|From {{national}} hospital admission databases {{it appears}} that the need for neurosurgical intervention for IIH has increased markedly over the period between 1988 and 2002. This has been attributed at least in part to the rising prevalence of obesity, although some of this increase may be explained by the increased popularity of shunting over optic nerve sheath <b>fenestration.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shunt {{surgery was}} {{introduced}} in 1949; initially, ventriculoperitoneal shunts were used. In 1971, good results were reported with lumboperitoneal shunting. Negative reports on shunting in the 1980s led to a brief period (1988–1993) during which optic nerve <b>fenestration</b> (which had initially been described in an unrelated condition in 1871) was more popular. Since then, shunting is recommended predominantly, with occasional exceptions.|$|E
40|$|<b>Fenestrations</b> are transcellular pores in endothelial {{cells that}} {{facilitate}} transfer of substrates between {{blood and the}} extravascular compartment. In {{order to understand the}} regulation and formation of <b>fenestrations,</b> the relationship between membrane rafts and <b>fenestrations</b> was investigated in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells where <b>fenestrations</b> are grouped into sieve plates. Three dimensional structured illumination microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, internal reflectance fluorescence microscopy and two-photon fluorescence microscopy were used to study liver sinusoidal endothelial cells isolated from mice. There was an inverse distribution between sieve plates and membrane rafts visualized by structured illumination microscopy and the fluorescent raft stain, Bodipy FL C 5 ganglioside GM 1. 7 -ketocholesterol and/or cytochalasin D increased both <b>fenestrations</b> and lipid-disordered membrane, while Triton X- 100 decreased both <b>fenestrations</b> and lipid-disordered membrane. The effects of cytochalasin D on <b>fenestrations</b> were abrogated by co-administration of Triton X- 100, suggesting that actin disruption increases <b>fenestrations</b> by its effects on membrane rafts. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) depleted lipid-ordered membrane and increased <b>fenestrations.</b> The results are consistent with a sieve-raft interaction, where <b>fenestrations</b> form in non-raft lipid-disordered regions of endothelial cells once the membrane-stabilizing effects of actin cytoskeleton and membrane rafts are diminished.

40|$|Glomerular {{endothelial cell}} (GEnC) <b>fenestrations</b> are {{analogous}} to podocyte filtration slits, but their {{important contribution to}} the glomerular filtration barrier has not received corresponding attention. GEnC <b>fenestrations</b> are transcytoplasmic holes, specialized for their unique role as a prerequisite for filtration across the glomerular capillary wall. Glomerular filtration rate {{is dependent on the}} fractional area of the <b>fenestrations</b> and, through the glycocalyx they contain, GEnC <b>fenestrations</b> are important in restriction of protein passage. Hence, dysregulation of GEnC <b>fenestrations</b> may be associated with both renal failure and proteinuria, and the pathophysiological importance of GEnC <b>fenestrations</b> is well characterized in conditions such as preeclampsia. Recent evidence suggests a wider significance in repair of glomerular injury and in common, yet serious, conditions, including diabetic nephropathy. Study of endothelial cell <b>fenestrations</b> is challenging because of limited availability of suitable in vitro models and by the requirement for electron microscopy to image these sub- 100 -nm structures. However, extensive evidence, from glomerular development in rodents to in vitro studies in human GEnC, points to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as a key inducer of <b>fenestrations.</b> In systemic endothelial <b>fenestrations,</b> the intracellular pathways through which VEGF acts to induce <b>fenestrations</b> include a key role for the fenestral diaphragm protein plasmalemmal vesicle-associated protein- 1 (PV- 1). The role of PV- 1 in GEnC is less clear, not least because of controversy over existence of GEnC fenestral diaphragms. In this article, the structure-function relationships of GEnC <b>fenestrations</b> will be evaluated in depth, their role in health and disease explored, and the outlook for future study and therapeutic implications of these peculiar structures will be approached...|$|R

30|$|At {{the current}} experiments, the pixel size of each FIB-SEM image is about 5 nm in XY {{direction}} and the FIB cutting step size is 15 nm in Z direction, {{and the size}} of live sinusoid <b>fenestrations</b> are approximately 50 – 150 nm in diameter, thus the <b>fenestrations</b> can be well resolved after the reconstructions by FIB-SEM method (Fig.  2 A and 2 B). In normal mice, most <b>fenestrations</b> are irregular holes with a relative large size (Fig.  2 A) while, in As(III)-exposed mice, a majority of <b>fenestrations</b> appear as approximately round holes {{and most of them are}} relatively smaller than those in normal ones (Fig.  2 B).|$|R
30|$|Since {{the size}} of <b>fenestrations</b> (> 100 nm) {{is larger than the}} {{thickness}} of normal TEM sections (~ 70 nm), the overall morphology of <b>fenestrations</b> and their distribution along the sinusoidal vessel could not be resolved from a single TEM image.

40|$|Liver {{sinusoidal}} endothelial cells (LSEC) {{are characterized}} {{by the presence of}} <b>fenestrations</b> that are not bridged by a diaphragm. The molecular mechanisms that control the formation of the <b>fenestrations</b> are largely unclear. Here we report that mice, which are deficient in plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein (PLVAP), develop a distinct phenotype that is caused by the lack of sinusoidal <b>fenestrations.</b> <b>Fenestrations</b> with a diaphragm were not observed in mouse LSEC at three weeks of age, but were present during embryonic life starting from embryonic day 12. 5. PLVAP was expressed in LSEC of wild-type mice, but not in that of Plvap-deficient littermates. Plvap(-/-) LSEC showed a pronounced and highly significant {{reduction in the number of}} <b>fenestrations,</b> a finding, which was seen both by transmission and scanning electron microscopy. The lack of <b>fenestrations</b> was associated with an impaired passage of macromolecules such as FITC-dextran and quantum dot nanoparticles from the sinusoidal lumen into Disse's space. Plvap-deficient mice suffered from a pronounced hyperlipoproteinemia as evidenced by milky plasma and the presence of lipid granules that occluded kidney and liver capillaries. By NMR spectroscopy of plasma, the nature of hyperlipoproteinemia was identified as massive accumulation of chylomicron remnants. Plasma levels of low density lipoproteins (LDL) were also significantly increased as were those of cholesterol and triglycerides. In contrast, plasma levels of high density lipoproteins (HDL), albumin and total protein were reduced. At around three weeks of life, Plvap-deficient livers developed extensive multivesicular steatosis, steatohepatitis, and fibrosis. PLVAP is critically required for the formation of <b>fenestrations</b> in LSEC. Lack of <b>fenestrations</b> caused by PLVAP deficiency substantially impairs the passage of chylomicron remnants between liver sinusoids and hepatocytes, and finally leads to liver damage...|$|R

5|$|Architecture {{during the}} early English Renaissance was far less formal than that of {{mainland}} Europe and drew from a greater selection of motifs both ancient and modern, with less emphasis placed on the strict observance of rules derived from antique architecture. This {{has led to an}} argument that the style was an evolution of Gothic rather than an innovation imported from Europe. This argument is evident at Montacute, where Gothic pinnacles, albeit obelisk in form, are combined with Renaissance gables, pediments, classical statuary, ogee roofs and windows appearing as bands of glass. This profusion of large, mullioned windows, an innovation of their day, give the appearance that the principal façade is built entirely of glass; a similar <b>fenestration</b> was employed at Hardwick Hall in Derbyshire. However, despite the Dutch gables, a feature of the English Renaissance acquired as the style spread from France across the Low Countries to England, and the Gothic elements, much of the architectural influence is Italian.|$|E
5|$|In 1750, now well-known, the {{architect}} received an important commission to remodel Euston Hall in East Anglia, the Suffolk country {{seat of the}} influential 2nd Duke of Grafton. The original house, built circa 1666 in the French style, was built around a central court with large pavilions at each corner. While keeping the original layout, Brettingham formalised the <b>fenestration</b> and imposed a more classically severe order whereby the pavilions were transformed to towers in the Palladian fashion (similar to those of Inigo Jones's at Wilton House). The pavilions' domes were replaced by low pyramid roofs similar to those at Holkham.

5|$|Optic nerve sheath <b>fenestration</b> is an {{operation}} that involves the making of an incision in the connective tissue lining of the optic nerve in its portion behind the eye. It is not entirely clear how it protects the eye from the raised pressure, {{but it may be}} the result of either diversion of the CSF into the orbit or the creation of an area of scar tissue that lowers the pressure. The effects on the intracranial pressure itself are more modest. Moreover, the procedure may lead to significant complications, including blindness in 1–2%. The procedure is therefore recommended mainly in those who have limited headache symptoms but significant papilledema or threatened vision, or in those who have undergone unsuccessful treatment with a shunt or have a contraindication for shunt surgery.|$|E
40|$|Liver {{sinusoidal}} endothelial cells (LSECs) represent unique type of endothelial cells featured {{by their}} characteristic morphology, ie, {{lack of a}} basement membrane and presence of fenestrations—transmembrane pores acting as a dynamic filter between the vascular space and the liver parenchyma. Delicate structure of LSECs membrane combined with a submicron size of <b>fenestrations</b> hinders their visualization in live cells. In this work, we apply atomic force microscopy contact mode to characterize <b>fenestrations</b> in LSECs. We reveal the structure of <b>fenestrations</b> in live LSECs. Moreover, we show that the high-resolution imaging of <b>fenestrations</b> is possible for the glutaraldehyde-fixed LSECs.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{investigation}} was to characterize the spatial geometry of the <b>fenestrations</b> (windows) in the internal elastic lamina (IEL) from human cerebral arteries. The IEL was isolated from the arterial wall and prepared for examination by the scanning electron microscope. A new method identified a uniform shrinkage for the IEL of only 6. 9 (+OR-) 0. 21 SEM %. The photomicrographs of the external surface of the IEL revealed a continuous sheet penetrated by numerous round <b>fenestrations</b> with smooth borders. Four geometrical characteristics based upon the diameter and the number of <b>fenestrations</b> in the field of view for every photomicrograph, were calculated for each specimen: Diameter (the average diameter of the fenestrations); Density (the number of <b>fenestrations</b> per square millimeter); Percentage Area (percentage of the surface area comprised of fenestrations); and Ligament Efficiency (minimum width of a solid band of material divided by the centre-to-centre distance for two or a series of adjacent holes). The geometrical characteristics were computed for cylindrical segments of various diameters, associated with the tapering of the arterial tree. A replication of the <b>fenestrations</b> in a photomicrograph and a geometrical model (uniform array of holes with a constant diameter) with an equivalent ligament efficiency, were created in latex sheets for three cylindrical arterial segments with different arterial diameters. The physical behaviour and change in the spatial geometry of the <b>fenestrations</b> were assessed by uniaxially stretching the latex models.;A comparison of the geometrical characteristics for localized groups of <b>fenestrations</b> in the apical region with respect to the circumjacent region to bifurcations (branches in the arterial tree), revealed a significant increase in diameter (7. 0 (+OR-) 0. 34 SEM (mu) m versus 2. 1 (+OR-) 0. 13 SEM (mu) m), percentage area (15. 0 (+OR-) 1. 1 SEM % versus 1. 8 (+OR-) 0. 2 SEM %) and decrease in ligament efficiency (0. 65 (+OR-) 0. 08 SEM versus 0. 86 (+OR-) 0. 006 SEM). The uniaxial tensile characteristics (latex sheets) for replications of the regions of enlarged in relation to normal <b>fenestrations,</b> revealed an increase in elongation of 47 (+OR-) 0. 06 SD %. It is proposed that regions of enlarged <b>fenestrations</b> represent a weakness in the IEL which may play a prominent role in the etiology of intracranial saccular aneurysms...|$|R

40|$|Most {{endocrine}} hormones {{are produced}} in {{tissues and organs}} with permeable microvessels that may provide an excess of hormones to be transported by the blood circulation to the distal target organ. Here, we investigate whether leptin, an endocrine hormone, induces the formation of vascular <b>fenestrations</b> and permeability, and we characterize its angiogenic property {{in the presence of}} other angiogenic factors. We provide evidence that leptin-induced new blood vessels are fenestrated. Under physiological conditions, capillary <b>fenestrations</b> are found in the leptin-producing adipose tissue in lean mice.
