5000|$|... a) <b>Inertial</b> <b>impaction</b> - When water {{droplets}} {{placed in the}} path of a dust-laden gas stream, the stream separates and flows around them. Due to inertia, the larger dust particles will continue on in a straight path, hit the droplets, and become encapsulated.|$|E
50|$|This {{range of}} droplet sizes is between 500 and 1,000 µm for gravity-spray (counter current) towers. The {{injection}} {{of water at}} very high pressures - 2070-3100 kPa (300-450 psi) - creates a fog of very fine droplets. Higher particle-collection efficiencies can be achieved in such cases since collection mechanisms other than <b>inertial</b> <b>impaction</b> occur. However, these spray nozzles may use more power to form droplets than would a venturi operating at the same collection efficiency.|$|E

The present calculations are confined to low mass-loading situations but span the entire particle size range from vapor molecules to particles near the onset of <b>inertial</b> ('eddy') <b>impaction.</b> It is shown that, when Sc {{is much greater than}} 1, thermophoresis greatly increases particle deposition rates to internally cooled solid walls, but only partially offsets the appreciable reduction in deposition rates associated with dust-free gas-transpiration-cooled surfaces. Thus, efficient particle sampling from hot dusty gases can be carried out using transpiration 'shielded' probe surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Combustion-generated fine particles, {{defined as}} those with {{aerodynamic}} diameters less than 2. 5 lm, have come under increased regulatory scrutiny because of suspected links to adverse human health effects. Whereas classical theories regarding coal combustion suggest that mechanisms of ash vaporization and fragmentation lead to bimodal ash particle size distributions (PSDs), this paper presents experimental results supporting other existing hypotheses that three distinct ash modes may be more appropriate. This paper focuses on the existence and generality of a central mode, between approximately 0. 7 and 3. 0 lm diameter. This central mode is presumably caused by fragmentation mechanisms, but is still important from a health perspective, because a large portion is contained within the 2. 5 lm particle size fraction. Presented here are experimental results from two different laboratory combustors and one industrial boiler, all burning pulverized coals. Use {{of a variety of}} particle-sampling and size classification methods, including electrical mobility, time-of-flight, and <b>inertial</b> (low-pressure <b>impaction)</b> methods, confirms that the central mode is not an artifact of the particle-sampling and-sizing methods used. Results from the combustion of 10 different coals consistently show that this central mode is significant for both high- and low-rank coals. Size-segregated elemental distributions of calcium, iron, and aluminum provide additional insight into mechanisms of formation of each mode. Field tests show that the central mode can be the major contributo...|$|R
40|$|This type of {{technology}} {{is a part of}} the group of air pollution controls collectively referred to as “wet scrubbers. ” When used to control inorganic gases, they may also be referred to as “acid gas scrubbers. ” 2. Type of Technology: Removal of air pollutants by <b>inertial</b> or diffusional <b>impaction,</b> reaction with a sorbent or reagent slurry, or absorption into liquid solvent. 3. Applicable Pollutants: Primarily inorganic fumes, vapors, and gases (e. g., chromic acid, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, chlorides, fluorides, and SO 2); volatile organic compounds (VOC); and particulate matter (PM), including PM less than or equal to 10 micrometers (µm) in aerodynamic diameter (PM 10), PM less than or equal to 2. 5 µm in aerodynamic diameter (PM 2. 5), and hazardous air pollutants (HAP) in particulate form (PM HAP). Absorption is widely used as a raw material and/or product recovery technique in separation and purification of gaseous streams containing high concentrations of VOC, especially watersoluble compounds such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, acetone, and formaldehyde (Croll Reynolds, 1999). Hydrophobic VOC can be absorbed using an amphiphilic bloc...|$|R
50|$|The {{flamingos}} feed {{from the}} bottom layer of the lake for small particles, mainly diatoms. They have a deep-keeled bill; the upper mandible is narrower than the lower, creating a gape on the dorsal surface of the bill. The bill morphology facilitates feeding of diatoms through <b>inertial</b> <b>impaction.</b> This mechanism entails that food particles denser than water, such as diatoms, would impact the filtering surface in the bill causing water to flow out of the mouth and leaving diatoms in the flamingo's bill. The flamingos forage in shallow salty waters for resources. They exhibit the most flexible foraging pattern {{compared to that of}} the Chilean and James's flamingos.|$|E
50|$|In {{the context}} of {{radiation}} protection, activity median aerodynamic diameter (AMAD) {{is one of two}} parameters influencing the deposition of inhaled particles, the other being the geometric standard deviation of the particle size distribution. The AMAD is the value of aerodynamic diameter for which 50% of the airborne activity in a given aerosol is associated with particles smaller than the AMAD, and 50% of the activity is associated with particles larger than the AMAD. The AMAD is used in internal dosimetry as a means of simplifying the true distribution of aerodynamic diameters of a given aerosol as a single value. It is used to describe those particle sizes for which deposition depends chiefly on <b>inertial</b> <b>impaction</b> and sedimentation.|$|E
50|$|The use of {{nanofiber}} webs as a {{filtering medium}} is well established. Due {{to the small}} size of the fibers London-Van Der Waals forces are an important method of adhesion between the fibers and the captured materials. Polymeric nanofibers have been used in air filtration applications for more than seven decades. Because of poor bulk mechanical properties of thin nanowebs, they are laid over a filtration medium substrate. The small fiber diameters cause slip flows at fiber surfaces, causing an increase in the interception and <b>inertial</b> <b>impaction</b> efficiencies of these composite filter media. The enhanced filtration efficiency at the same pressure drop is possible with fibers having diameters less than 0.5 micrometer. Since the essential properties of protective clothing are high moisture vapor transport, increased fabric breath-ability, and enhanced toxic chemical resistance, electrospun nanofiber membranes are good candidates for these applications.|$|E

Type of Technology: Removal of air pollutants by <b>inertial</b> or diffusional <b>impaction,</b> reaction with a sorbent or reagent slurry, or absorption into liquid solvent. 3. Applicable Pollutants: Primarily particulate matter (PM), including particulate matter less than or equal to 10 micrometers (µm) in aerodynamic diameter (PM 10), particulate matter less than or equal to 2. 5 µm in aerodynamic diameter (PM 2. 5), and hazardous air pollutants (HAP) in particulate form (PM HAP); and inorganic fumes, vapors, and gases (e. g., chromic acid, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, chlorides, fluorides, and SO 2). These types of scrubbers may also occasionally be used to control volatile organic compounds (VOC). Hydrophilic VOC may be controlled with and aqueous fluid, and hydrophobic VOC may be controlled with an amphiphilic block copolymer in the water.

40|$|Regenerable filters {{will play}} an {{important}} role in human exploration beyond low-Earth orbit. Life Support Systems aboard crewed spacecrafts will have to operate reliably and with little maintenance over periods of more than a year, even multiple years. Air filters are a key component of spacecraft life support systems, but they often require frequent routine maintenance. Bacterial filters aboard the International Space Station require almost weekly cleaning of the pre-filter screen to remove large lint debris captured in the microgravity environment. The source of the airborne matter which is collected on the filter screen is typically from clothing fibers, biological matter (hair, skin, nails, etc.) and material wear. Clearly a need for low maintenance filters requiring little to no crew intervention will be vital to the success of the mission. An impactor filter is being developed and tested to address this need. This filter captures large particle matter through <b>inertial</b> separation and <b>impaction</b> methods on collection surfaces, which can be automatically cleaned after they become heavily loaded. The impactor filter can serve as a pre-filter to augment the life of higher efficiency filters that capture fine and ultrafine particles. A prototype of the filter is being tested at the Particulate Filtration Laboratory at NASA Glenn Research Center to determine performance characteristics, including particle cut size and overall efficiency. Model results are presented for the flow characteristics near the orifice plate through which the particle-laden flow is accelerated as well as around the collection bands...|$|R

40|$|Some {{fundamental}} problems, arising in the filtration of gases by fixed beds of granular collector, are reviewed. Capture of gas-borne particles by {{the collector}} normally occurs mainly by {{the processes of}} Brownian diffusion, <b>inertial</b> <b>impaction</b> and electrophoretic migration. Diffusional and electrophoretic capture are controlled by processes occurring {{close to the surface}} of the collector, and theoretical models are reasonably successful in predicting capture rates. Theoretical estimates for <b>inertial</b> <b>impaction</b> are much less reliable, and reasons for this are discussed. Retention of a particle by the collector is governed by a balance between particle kinetic energy and adhesion energy; trajectory calculations can be used to estimate conditions under which a captured particle is retained by the collector...|$|E
40|$|The {{flow field}} through a {{staggered}} array of parallel, rectangular split-type electret fibers was numerically modeled. The particle trajectory and the collection efficiency were simulated by solving {{the equation of}} particle motion, {{taking into account the}} effects of diffusion, interception, <b>inertial</b> <b>impaction,</b> and electrostatic forces. The model was validated against results calculated from semiempirical expressions. The model was applied to investigate the role of the <b>inertial</b> <b>impaction</b> and the interception mechanisms in the particle collection by an electret fiber, the particle trajectories under various filtration conditions, the effect of the aspect ratio of the rectangular fiber on the filter penetration, and the distribution of the deposited particles {{on the surface of the}} fiber. The simulated results indicate that the <b>inertial</b> <b>impaction</b> and interception mechanisms account for a major portion of neutral particles collected by an electret fiber when the Stokes number is higher than 0. 5. For neutral particles, fibers with an aspect ratio of 38 / 10 have almost the same penetration as fibers with an aspect ratio of 10 / 38; while for singly charged particles, fibers with an aspect ratio of 38 / 10 achieve a much lower penetration when the electrophoretic collection mechanism dominates. In addition, it is predicted that a filter composed of fibers with an aspect ratio of 38 / 10 will result in a lower flow resistance and thus a slower clogging process when the dielectrophoretic collection mechanism dominates.

Such representations are shown to minimize apparent differences between various geometric, flow, and physicochemical parameters, allowing many apparently different physicochemical situations to be described in a unified way...|$|E
40|$|To achieve {{successful}} real-time {{detection of}} airborne pathogenic microorganisms, the problem {{must be considered}} in terms of their physical size and biological characteristics. We developed an airborne microorganism detection chip to realize the detection of microorganisms, ensuring compactness, sensitivity, cost-efficiency, and portability, using three key components: an <b>inertial</b> <b>impaction</b> system, a cartridge-type impaction plate, and a mini-fluorescent microscope. The <b>inertial</b> <b>impaction</b> system was used to separate microorganisms in terms of their aerodynamic particle size, and was fabricated with three impaction stages. Numerical analysis was performed to design the system; the calculated cutoff diameter at each impaction stage was 2. 02 (first stage), 0. 88 (second stage), and 0. 54 μm (third stage). The measured cutoff diameters were 2. 24, 0. 91, and 0. 49 μm, respectively. A cartridge-type impaction plate was used, composed of molded polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and an actual impaction region made of a SYBR green I dye-stained agar plate. A mini-fluorescent microscope was used to distinguish microbes from non-biological particles. Images of the microorganisms deposited at the impaction zone were obtained via mini-fluorescent microscopy, and fluorescent intensities of the images were calculated using in-house image-processing software. The results showed that the developed system successfully identified aerosolized biological particles from non-biological particles in real time...|$|E
40|$|Monitoring of ambient PM 10 {{concentrations}} {{was carried out}} using two co–located samplers at 10 different locations over the three seasons (summer, winter and post–monsoon) in Delhi, India. The samplers used for the study were the high volume sampler fitted with a cyclone (commonly known in India as respirable particulate matter sampler or RPM sampler), and a 4 –channel speciation sampler (4 -SS). The RPM sampler separates the PM 10 fraction using centrifugal inertia while the 4 -SS separates them using the principle of mass <b>inertial</b> <b>impaction.</b> Comparison of the measured data are made using different graphical techniques and statistical analysis, comprising classical two tailed paired t–test and the criteria recommended by the European Commission working group on particulate matter. The PM 10 data monitored by both the samplers showed good overall correlations for the entire data set, with a regression co-efficient value of 0. 61. Results indicated that <b>inertial</b> <b>impaction</b> based 4 -SS consistently measures higher PM 10 concentration compared with the cyclone fitted RPM sampler. Such results were valid for 81 % of the total data set and this difference in measured {{concentrations was}} ∼ 66 % in the regulatory limit value ranges. Both the samplers have their merits and limitations and hence a conscious choice and appropriate data correction is needed when deploying them for scientific and regulatory monitoring purposes...|$|E

40|$|Condensing economizers {{increase}} the thermal efficiency of boilers by recovering sensible and latent heat from exhaust gas. These economizers {{are currently being}} used commercially for this purpose {{in a wide range}} of applications. Performance is dependent upon application-specific factors affecting the utility of recovered heat. With the addition of a condensing economizer boiler efficiency improvements up to 10 % are possible. Condensing economizers can also capture flue gas particulates. In this work, the potential use of condensing economizers for both efficiency improvement and control of particulate emissions from small, coal water slurry-fired boilers was evaluated. Analysis was done to predict heat transfer and particulate capture by mechanisms including: <b>inertial</b> <b>impaction,</b> interception, diffusion, thermophoretic forces, and condensation growth. Shell-and-tube geometries were considered with flue gas on the outside of Teflon-covered tubes. Experimental studies were done with both air- and water-cooled economizers refit to a small boiler. Two experimental arrangements were used including oil-firing with injection of flyash upstream of the economizer and direct coal water slurry firing. Firing rates ranged from 27 to 82 kW (92, 000 to 280, 000 Btu/hr). <b>Inertial</b> <b>impaction</b> was found to be the most important particulate capture mechanism and removal efficiencies to 95 % were achieved. With the addition of water sprays directly on the first row of tubes, removal efficiencies increased to 98 %. Use of these sprays adversely affects heat recovery.

The aerosolisation performance of capsule based DPI formulations containing budesonide (200 mu g) and different grades of lactose evaluated using <b>inertial</b> <b>impaction</b> measurements produced fine particle doses of budesonide ranging from 24 to 49 mu g.

40|$|Background: While it is {{generally}} accepted that <b>inertial</b> <b>impaction</b> will lead to particle loss as aerosol is being carried into the pulmonary airways, most predictive aerosol deposition models adopt {{the hypothesis that the}} inhaled particles that remain airborne will distribute according to the gas flow distribution between airways downstream. Methods: Using a 3 D printed cast of human airways, we quantified particle deposition and distribution and visualized their inhaled trajectory in the human lung. The human airway cast was exposed to 6 [*]μm monodisperse, radiolabeled aerosol particles at distinct inhaled flow rates and imaged by scintigraphy in two perpendicular planes. In addition, we also imaged the distribution of aerosol beyond the airways into the five lung lobes. The experimental aerosol deposition patterns could be mimicked by computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation in the same 3 D airway geometry. Results: It was shown that for particles with a diameter of 6 [*]μm inhaled at flows up to 60 [*]L/min, the aerosol distribution over both lungs and the individual five lung lobes roughly followed the corresponding distributions of gas flow. While aerosol deposition was greater in the main bronchi of the left versus right lung, distribution of deposited and suspended particles toward the right lung exceeded that of the left lung. The CFD simulations also predict that for both 3 and 6 [*]μm particles, aerosol distribution between lung units subtending from airways in generation 5 did not match gas distribution between these units and that this effect was driven by <b>inertial</b> <b>impaction.</b> Conclusions: We showed combined imaging experiments and CFD simulations to systematically study aerosol deposition patterns in human airways down to generation 5, where particle deposition could be spatially linked to the airway geometry. As particles are negotiating an increasing number of airways in subsequent branching generations, CFD predicts marked deviations of aerosol distribution with respect to ventilation distribution, even in the normal human lung...|$|E
