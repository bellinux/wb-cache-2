5|$|Originally, {{the story}} of a woman {{separated}} <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> when the plane crashes was going to be used for Kate, but when Kate's role in the series changed the producers kept that story for Rose.

Due to Caldwell and Anderson having other acting commitments, the writers found it difficult finding time when both actors could appear together in the show, resulting in neither character featuring in most of season three. Critics reacted positively to the couple, often hoping they would appear more frequently, and both actors were praised for their work.|$|E
