40|$|The study {{focuses on}} the {{evaluation}} of the structural plans and provides a tool for analyzing the direct and indirect effects of these funds with reference to the 2014 - 2020 Programming Period for Romania. This analysis requires the construction of accounting scheme, the SAM, that comprehensively includes the circular flow of income and that takes into account also the labor demand, giving a picture of the workforce. The paper therefore makes use of a dynamic multisectoral extended model taking into account the exogenous shocks of the programmed policy, where the requirement of labor depends on the production changes. The short-term dynamic model will be used for assessing the labor force growth for the seven years of programming when examining two hypothetical scenarios. The two solutions will provide an overall assessment of the impact of Large <b>Infrastructure</b> <b>OP</b> on the domestic labor requirement and on the main aggregates...|$|E
40|$|At {{the time}} of this reporting, there are 2, 589 rich mobile devices used at JPL, {{including}} 1, 550 iPhones and 968 Blackberrys. Considering a total JPL population of 5, 961 employees, mobile applications have a total addressable market of 43 percent of the employees at JPL, and that number is rising. While it was found that no existing desktop tools can realistically be replaced by a mobile application, there is certainly a need to improve access to these desktop tools. When an alarm occurs and an engineer is away from his desk, a convenient means of accessing relevant data can save an engineer {{a great deal of time}} and improve his job efficiency. To identify which data is relevant, an engineer benefits from a succinct overview of the data housed in 13 + tools. This need can be well met by a single, rich, mobile application that provides access to desired data across tools in the <b>ops</b> <b>infrastructure...</b>|$|R
