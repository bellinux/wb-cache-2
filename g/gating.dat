These defects {{can be caused}} by cold dies, low metal temperature, dirty metal, lack of venting, or too much lubricant. Other possible defects are gas porosity, shrinkage porosity, hot tears, and flow marks.

25|$|Finally, cytometric {{fingerprinting}} uses {{a variant}} of frequency difference <b>gating</b> to set bins and measure {{for a series of}} samples how many cells fall within each bin.

25|$|Another {{source of}} {{controversy}} {{is the relationship}} between smoking and sensory <b>gating</b> in schizophrenia. Nicotine may help improve auditory <b>gating,</b> the ability to screen out intrusive environmental sounds. This may help improve attention spans and reduce auditory hallucinations, allowing people with schizophrenia to perceive the environment more effectively and engage in smoother motor functions. However, research shows this effect alone cannot account for increased smoking rates.|$|E

25|$|The flux of ions {{through the}} {{potassium}} channel pore is regulated by two related processes, termed <b>gating</b> and inactivation. <b>Gating</b> is the opening or {{closing of the}} channel in response to stimuli, while inactivation is the rapid cessation of current from an open potassium channel and {{the suppression of the}} channel's ability to resume conducting. While both processes serve to regulate channel conductance, each process may be mediated by a number of mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|Generally, <b>gating</b> {{is thought}} to be {{mediated}} by additional structural domains which sense stimuli and in turn open the channel pore. These domains include the RCK domains of BK channels, and voltage sensor domains of voltage gated K+ channels. These domains are thought to respond to the stimuli by physically opening the intracellular gate of the pore domain, thereby allowing potassium ions to traverse the membrane. Some channels have multiple regulatory domains or accessory proteins, which can act to modulate the response to stimulus. While the mechanisms continue to be debated, there are known structures of a number of these regulatory domains, including RCK domains of prokayrotic and eukaryotic channels, pH <b>gating</b> domain of KcsA, cyclic nucleotide <b>gating</b> domains, and voltage gated potassium channels.|$|E
25|$|The <b>gating</b> {{system must}} be part of the pattern because the entire mold is formed from the pattern, which can be expensive.|$|E

50|$|These city <b>gates</b> were {{initially}} simple <b>gates</b> which were repeatedly strengthened over {{time so that}} they eventually all had an outer, middle and inner <b>gate.</b> Today, only fragments remain of these ancient city <b>gates.</b> The <b>gate</b> {{now known as the}} Citadel <b>Gate</b> is the former Interior Citadel Gate; the Middle and Outer Citadel <b>Gates</b> no longer exist.

25|$|In {{datasets}} with a {{low number}} of dimensions and limited cross-sample technical and biological variability (e.g., clinical laboratories), manual analysis of specific cell populations can produce effective and reproducible results.

In one study, several computational <b>gating</b> algorithms performed better than manual analysis in the presence of some variation.
