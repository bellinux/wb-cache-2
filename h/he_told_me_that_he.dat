500|$|Nevertheless, [...] {{with the}} {{primitive}} facilities {{available at the}} time, Ulam and von Neumann did carry out numerical computations {{that led to a}} satisfactory design. This motivated their advocacy of a powerful computational capability at Los Alamos, which began during the war years, continued through the cold war, and still exists. Otto Frisch remembered Ulam as [...] "a brilliant Polish topologist with a charming French wife. At once <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a pure mathematician who had sunk so low that his latest paper actually contained numbers with decimal points!" ...|$|E
2500|$|After his death, Powell's friend Richard Ritchie {{recorded}} in 1998 that [...] "during {{one of the}} habitual coal crises of recent years <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had no objection to supporting the coal industry, either through the restriction of cheap coal imports or subsidy, {{if it were the}} country's wish to preserve local coal communities".|$|E
2500|$|Driven by an unswerving {{belief in}} his abilities, Romário's laid back manner and {{overwhelming}} self-confidence would be displayed throughout his career, with Guus Hiddink, his coach at PSV, stating, “If {{he saw that}} I was a bit more nervous than usual ahead of a big game, he’d {{come to me and}} say: ‘Take it easy, coach, I’m going to score and we’re going to win'. What’s incredible is that eight out of the ten times <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> <b>he</b> really did score and we really did win.” ...|$|E

It never went ahead, but <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> there was an underground section of the bunker, which he thought was under the generator room".|$|R

2500|$|According {{to former}} President Jimmy Carter, several weeks {{following}} his retirement, Rickover [...] "was {{invited to the}} Oval Office and decided to don his full dress uniform. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> refused to take a seat, listened to the president ask him to be his special nuclear advisor, replied 'Mr. President, that is bullshit,' and then walked out." [...] The Navy's official investigation of General Dynamics' Electric Boat division was ended shortly afterward. According to Theodore Rockwell, Rickover's Technical Director for more than 15 years, more than one source at that time stated that General Dynamics officials were bragging around Washington that they had [...] "gotten Rickover." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{according}} to Charles Lyell, Cuvier made this statement after a late party and apparently had some doubts when reconsidering the matter when he awoke, fresh in the morning. [...] "The next morning <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was confident that}} it was something quite different." [...] Strangely, this change of opinion did not make it back to Britain where Mantell was mocked for his error. Mantell was still convinced that the teeth had come from the Mesozoic strata and finally recognised that they resembled those of the iguana, but were twenty times larger. He surmised that the owner of the remains must have been at least 60feet (18metres) in length.|$|E
2500|$|In 1933, Furtwängler {{met with}} Hitler {{to try to}} stop the new antisemitic policy in the domain of music. He had {{prepared}} a list of significant Jewish musicians: these included the composer Arnold Schoenberg, the musicologist Curt Sachs, the violinist Carl Flesch, and Jewish members of the Berlin Philharmonic. Hitler did not listen to Furtwängler, who lost patience, and the meeting became a shouting match. Berta Geissmar wrote, [...] "After the audience, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> knew now what was behind Hitler's narrow-minded measures. This is not only antisemitism, but the rejection of any form of artistic, philosophical thought, the rejection of any form of free culture..." ...|$|E

We became very, very great friends, {{and all of his}} books - The Madman, The Forerunner, The Son of Man, The Prophet - I heard in manuscript. He always gave me his books. I liked The Prophet best. I don't believe that there was any connection between `Abdu'l-Bahá and The Prophet. But <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> thought of the `Abdu'l-Bahá all through.

He told me definitely that [...] The Son of Man was influenced by '`Abdu'l-Bahá." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} alleged that Grace's illness {{developed}} [...] "after {{sleeping in a}} damp hotel bed". Gilbert, who stayed at the hotel for several days, later wrote to The Daily Telegraph: [...] "It having come to my knowledge there is a rumour abroad that Mr. G. F. Grace's fatal illness was caused by sleeping in a damp bed at the Red Lion Hotel, Basingstoke, I beg to contradict it. He had a bad cold before he left home, and on my arrival at Basingstoke <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had received another chill whilst waiting at Reading Station. By inserting this you will greatly oblige me, and also {{do justice to the}} members of a family whose attention and kindness to my cousin all through his illness could not have been surpassed had he been at home". The [...] "damp bed" [...] story is refuted by evidence to the contrary, as described above, because Grace's illness began with the cold he caught during the match at The Oval and he was already ill when he arrived in Basingstoke.|$|E
2500|$|Children of Bodom's {{first world}} tour began in 2003 and lasted until late 2004. The tour had many sold-out concerts and marked the {{consolidation}} of the band in North America, but was also accompanied by an unexpected announcement: Kuoppala decided to quit Children of Bodom for personal reasons {{right in the middle}} of the tour without giving previous warning. In an interview, when Laiho was asked why Kuoppala left the band, he stated that, [...] "Well, I try to be careful about what I say about him because there is no bad blood between us. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> just got sick of touring and the whole band/rock 'n roll lifestyle living in hotels and tour buses and stuff. For me it was really weird because he was always the one who was SO into it! He was a die hard rock 'n roller and suddenly he made a quick 180 turn in his whole life. This whole situation involves a new girlfriend." [...] Griffin's guitarist Kai Nergaard was invited by Laiho to replace Kuoppala, but did not accept the offer. Thus, Alexi's bandmate from Sinergy, Roope Latvala (founding member of Stone, one of the bands which started the heavy metal movement in Finland) assumed the guitars as a session player, until a more permanent solution could be found. This formation was introduced in Moscow on 16 August.|$|E
