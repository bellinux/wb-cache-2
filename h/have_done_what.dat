After completing the five modules, participants need to complete Focus, as well as Horizons, an evaluation of participants' time in ventures and a look ahead at the future.

500|$|Although {{they were}} locally contentious, the trials boosted Seward's image across the North. He gained further {{publicity}} {{in association with}} Ohioan Salmon P. Chase when handling the unsuccessful appeal in the United States Supreme Court of John Van Zandt, an anti-slavery advocate sued by a slaveowner for assisting African Americans in escaping on the Underground Railroad. Chase was impressed with Seward, writing that the former New York governor [...] "was {{one of the very}} first public men in our country.

500|$|Plots {{during the}} first ten [...] "boy and his dog" [...] seasons were similar: the boy (Jeff or Timmy) got {{into some sort of}} trouble. Lassie then dashed off to get help or rushed in to save her master's life herself. After being reunited with family and {{breathing}} a sigh of relief, the boy received a light lecture on why he should not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>what</b> he had done. In 2004, June Lockhart described the show as [...] "...a fairy tale about people on a farm in which the dog solves all the problems in 22 minutes, in time for the last commercial." ...|$|E
500|$|ABC {{canceled}} Our World {{after its}} first season, {{replacing it with}} the situation comedies Sledge Hammer! and The Charmings. Ellerbee and Gandolf learned that the show had been canceled from a segment on Entertainment Tonight. Ellerbee sharply criticized ABC for the cancellation, saying [...] "If they had left it there {{for three to four}} years, it could <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>what</b> 60 Minutes did, which went against the Disney juggernaut on NBC. It could have developed slowly as an alternative program without being in the ratings race." [...] The advocacy group Viewers for Quality Television mounted a letter-writing campaign to save the show – similar to campaigns that had saved Designing Women and Cagney and Lacey – and generated some 20,000 letters of support, [...] but the campaign was unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|The rather later satirist Juvenal (born, probably, in the 50s CE) also {{provides}} {{evidence for the}} monkey, he even pities the monkey, at one point, as an innocent sufferer. Not so with how Emperor Nero was reviled. In one play, Juvenal suggests that for Nero, being put in merely one sack is not good enough. This might, for example, be a reference both {{to the death of}} Nero's mother Agrippina Minor, widely believed to have been murdered on Nero's orders, and also to how Nero murdered his fatherland. Not only Juvenal thought the sack was the standard by which the appropriate punishment for Nero should be measured; the statues of Nero were despoiled and vandalized, and according to the Roman historian Suetonius, one statue was draped in a sack given a placard that said [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>what</b> I could. But you deserve the sack!".|$|E

500|$|During {{recording}} {{sessions for}} their upcoming album, vocalist Gregg Allman was {{also working on}} his solo album, Laid Back, and the sessions occasionally overlapped. Chuck Leavell was asked to play piano for Allman's solo album, and gradually found himself contributing to the Allman Brothers as well. Allman and Betts took turns caring for Oakley, taking him outdoors to places like the zoo {{to keep him from}} drinking as much. [...] "Time and time again, I have sat and wondered, 'God, what in the hell could I <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> <b>what</b> could have anybody have done, to help him?'" [...] said Allman. Upon Leavell's entry into the group, Oakley {{went out of his way}} to make the new member comfortable. On November 11, 1972, overjoyed at the prospect of leading a jam session later that night, Oakley crashed his motorcycle into the side of a bus, just three blocks from where Duane had been killed in a bike accident. He declined hospital treatment and went home, but gradually grew delirious. He was taken to the hospital shortly thereafter and died of cerebral swelling caused by a fractured skull. Oakley was buried directly beside Duane at Rose Hill Cemetery in Macon, Georgia.|$|E
500|$|The {{debate on}} the death toll {{has gone on for}} many decades to the point where some historians have begun to {{question}} its usefulness on the grounds that excessive quibbling over the precise death toll has distracted from the study of other more important facets of the massacre. Daqing Yang, a historian at George Washington University, believes that [...] "an obsession with figures reduces an atrocity to abstraction and serves to circumvent a critical examination of the causes of and responsibilities for these appalling atrocities" [...] and Carol Gluck concurs that [...] "The crucial historical question remains the moral one: how could ordinary Japanese <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>what</b> they did? Numerological arguments about the death count and distinctions of comparative atrocities do not address this point." [...] However, Masahiro Yamamoto printed a rebuttal of Gluck's statement in his book Nanking: Anatomy of an Atrocity, arguing that [...] "To determine the extent and nature of [...] responsibility, the 'numerological arguments about the death count and distinctions of comparative atrocities,' which [...] termed as irrelevant to the moral question, are essential. Only after firmly establishing 'historical particularities' can one clearly define Japan’s responsibility. And based on a clear definition of the responsibility there can be an answer to the 'moral' question." ...|$|E

When Barth first met her in 1924 he had already been married for 12 years and, in 1929, she moved into the Barth family household, which included his wife Nelly and five children. George Hunsinger summarizes the influence of von Kirschbaum on Barth's work: [...] "As his unique student, critic, researcher, adviser, collaborator, companion, assistant, spokesperson, and confidante, Charlotte von Kirschbaum was indispensable to him.

2500|$|As an {{opposition}} stalwart {{and leader of}} the CPI group, Gupta's speeches in the Lok Sabha were marked by 'force with moderation, criticism with reason', and earned him the admiration of even his political opponents. Though not enamoured of office, Gupta accepted the cabinet berth in the United Front Government during 1996–98. As Home Minister, Gupta was still blunt about government's failures and raised many an eyebrow among the treasury benches with his frank observations. When he was the Home Minister and the BJP the main opposition party, his favourite phrase on meeting the more vocal opposition members after a stormy day was: [...] "If I were in the Opposition I'd <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>what</b> you did." ...|$|E
