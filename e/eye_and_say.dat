He was a full {{participant}} in the producing partnership with Gilbert and Sullivan, involved in casting and finding designers; in charge of publicity; directing and hiring designers for the non-Gilbert works, including the many companion pieces (sometimes with the help of assistants); and casting, directing and rehearsing the touring companies, among other duties. According to Henry Lytton, [...] "Mr. Carte was a great stage manager. He could take in the details of a scene with one sweep of his eagle <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> unerringly just what was wrong." [...] The quality of Carte's productions created a national and international taste for them, and he sent touring companies throughout the British provinces, to America (generally managed by Helen), Europe and elsewhere. Queen Victoria honoured the company by calling for a Royal Command Performance of The Gondoliers at Windsor Castle in 1891. Following the libretto closely, she noticed additions to the text made by some of the actors and asked Carte to explain why this was done. Carte replied that they [...] "are what we call 'gags'". The queen answered that she had always understood that [...] "gags were things that were put by authority into people's mouths." [...] Carte rejoined, [...] "These gags, Your Majesty, are things people put into their own mouths without authority." [...] George Bernard Shaw, writing in The World in October 1893, stated: ...|$|E

At the moment Sheriff Smutzer confronted him, and, before a word was uttered by the lawman, Lamphere exclaimed, [...] "Did Widow Gunness and the kids get out all right?" [...] He was then told about the fire, but he denied having {{anything}} to do with it, claiming that he was not near the farm when the blaze occurred. A youth, John Solyem, was brought forward. He said that he had been watching the Gunness place and that he saw Lamphere running down the road from the Gunness house just before the structure erupted in flames. Lamphere snorted to the boy: [...] "You wouldn't look me in the <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> <b>say</b> that!" ...|$|E
2500|$|MacGowan {{had decided}} to name the song after J. P. Donleavy's 1973 novel A Fairy Tale of New York, which Finer was reading {{at the time and}} had left lying around the {{recording}} studio. In the same Melody Maker interview MacGowan expressed regret that the song had not been completed in time to be released for Christmas that year, and hinted that the track would appear on an EP that The Pogues were due to record shortly. In January 1986 the group recorded the song during the sessions with Costello that would produce the Poguetry in Motion EP, with bass player Cait O'Riordan singing the female part. Costello suggested naming the song [...] "Christmas Eve in the Drunk Tank", after the song's opening lines: the band were scornful of the suggestion, with MacGowan pointing out to Costello that a song with such a title was unlikely to be favourably received and played by radio stations. The majority of the lyrics had been written while MacGowan was recovering in a bed in Malmö after being struck down with double pneumonia during a Pogues tour of Scandinavia in late 1985 – he later said, [...] "you get a lot of delirium and stuff, so I got quite a few good images out of that". However, despite several attempts at recording it, the group were unhappy with the results and the song was temporarily put aside, to be returned to at a later date. Guitarist Philip Chevron later said, [...] "It was not quite there. It needed to have a full-on, confident performance from the band, which it lacked." [...] The producer of the final version, Steve Lillywhite, diplomatically described the version recorded with O'Riordan's vocals as not [...] "fully realised". Extracts from these earlier versions can be heard on the 2008 box set Just Look Them Straight in the <b>Eye</b> <b>and</b> <b>Say...</b> POGUEMAHONE!!.|$|E

What will our fathers think the tribes of the Wyandots have become? They will look on their children with a dark <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> <b>say,</b> Go! a Chippewa has come hither with the name of a Huron. Brothers, we must not forget the dead; a redskin never ceases to remember. We will load the back of this Mohican until he staggers under our bounty, and despatch him after my young men. They call to us for aid, though our ears are not open; they say, Forget us not. When they see the spirit of this Mohican toiling after them with his burden, they will know we are of that mind. Then will they go on happy; and our children will say, 'So did our fathers to their friends, so must we do to them.' What is a Yengee? we have slain many, but the earth is still pale. A stain on the name of a Huron can only be hid by blood that comes from the veins of an Indian. Let this Delaware die." ...|$|E
