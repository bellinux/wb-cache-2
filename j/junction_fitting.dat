50|$|On 30 April 2015, USAF RC-135V, 64-14848, {{operating}} out of Offutt AFB, NE aborted takeoff on a routine training mission when crewmembers observed smoke and flames coming from the aft galley. The aircraft commander aborted the takeoff at about 50 KIAS and the cockpit crew, electronic warfare officers, intelligence operators and in-flight maintenance technicians—27 individuals in all—evacuated the aircraft. Although there were no injuries, except for minor smoke inhalation, the ensuing fire damaged aircraft control and mission related systems. Total repair cost was estimated at $62.4 million US. The cause of the mishap was failure by L3 Communications depot maintenance personnel to tighten a retaining nut connecting a metal oxygen tube to a <b>junction</b> <b>fitting</b> above the galley. This resulted in an oxygen leak and caused a highly flammable oxygen-rich environment that ignited. The resulting fire melted the retaining nut and caused the tubing to become detached, which fed even more to the fire, increased its size and caused severe damage to the airframe, galley and mission equipment aboard the aircraft. The oxygen system work which was listed {{as the cause of}} this 2015 mishap was completed in August 2013.|$|E
40|$|GaN-based Schottky diodes for microwave, millimeter-wave power {{applications}} {{were characterized}} and modeled. The modeling technique employed dummy structure to derive parasitic elements introduced by access pads. Intrinsic elements were extracted by <b>fitting</b> <b>junction</b> capacitance for fixed grading factor of 0. 5. Error function with physically meaning {{was used to}} fine tuning the resulted equivalent circuit model. The extracted model agrees well with the measurement results...|$|R
40|$|Energy losses {{occurring}} in pipe junctions {{have been studied}} for many years. Head loss coefficients (KK) are commonly used to characterize losses across elbows, tees, crosses, valves, and other pipe fittings. When accurate values of KK are used, the flow rate and corresponding total head at any location in a pipe network can be calculated. While KK is well defined for most pipe <b>junctions</b> and <b>fittings,</b> the literature has limited documentations of KK for crosses. This study was commissioned to determine KK {{for a wide range}} of flow combinations in a pipe cross with equal diameter pipes and varied flow combinations. This study provides and innovatively presents over 1, 000 experimental values of KK for designing and analyzing equal diameter pipe crosses...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{theoretical}} and experimental investigation about the impedance monitoring of green monkey kidney cells on electrodes during the cultivation or infection with herpes simplex viruses. Based on finite element simulations, a new equivalent circuit is {{developed for the}} electrical characteristics of cells on the electrode. Equivalent circuit parameters are determined from measured impedance data for both the cell/cell and cell/electrode <b>junctions.</b> Therefore a <b>fitting</b> technique based on the developed equivalent circuit model is used. The resistances of cell/cell and cell/electrode junction are decreased in accordance with multiplicity of virus infection...|$|R
40|$|A cDNA clone {{of maize}} Adh 1 which {{contains}} the entire protein coding {{region of the}} gene has been constructed. The protein sequence predicted from the nucleotide sequence is in agreement with limited protein sequencing data for the ADH 1 enzyme. An 11. 5 kb genomic fragment containing the Adh 1 gene has been isolated using the cDNA clone as a probe, and the gene region fully sequenced. The gene is interrupted by 9 introns, their <b>junction</b> sequences <b>fitting</b> the animal gene consensus sequence. Within the gene there is a triplication of a segment (104 bp) spanning an intron-exon junction. Presumptive promoter elements have been identified and are similar in nucleotide sequence and location, relative {{to the start of}} transcription, to those of other plant and animal genes. No recognizable poly(A+) addition signal is evident. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the cDNA (derived from an Adh 1 -F allele) and genomic (derived from an Adh 1 -S allele) clones has identified an amino acid difference consistent with the observed difference in electrophoretic mobility of the two enzymes. The maize ADH 1 amino acid sequence is 50 % homologous to that of horse liver ADH but is only 20 % homologous to yeast ADH...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} an {{experimental}} {{analysis of the}} charge transport properties of single mesitylene (1, 3, 5 -trimethylbenzene) molecular junctions. The electronic conductance and the current–voltage characteristics of mesitylene molecules wired into Au electrodes were measured by a scanning tunnelling microscopy-based break-junction method at room temperature in a liquid environment. We found the molecular junctions exhibited two distinct conductance states with high conductance values of ca. 10 − 1 G 0 and of more than 10 − 3 G 0 (G 0 = 2 e 2 / h) in the electronic conductance measurements. We further performed a statistical analysis of the current–voltage characteristics of the molecular junctions in the two states. Within a single channel resonant tunnelling model, we obtained electronic couplings in the molecular <b>junctions</b> by <b>fitting</b> the current–voltage characteristics to the single channel model. The origin of the high conductance was attributed to experimentally obtained large electronic couplings of the direct π-bonded molecular junctions (ca. 0. 15 eV). Based on analysis of the stretch length of the molecular junctions and the large electronic couplings obtained from the I – V analysis, we proposed two structural models, in which (i) mesitylene binds to the Au electrode perpendicular to the charge transport direction and (ii) mesitylene has tilted from the perpendicular orientation...|$|R
40|$|Solving {{for energy}} losses in pipe {{junctions}} {{has been a}} focus of study for many years. Although pipe <b>junctions</b> and <b>fittings</b> are at times considered 2 ̆ 2 minor losses 2 ̆ 2 {{in relation to other}} energy losses in a pipe network, there are cases where disregarding such losses in flow calculations will lead to errors. To facilitate these calculations, energy loss coefficients (K-factors) are commonly used to obtain energy losses for elbows, tees, crosses, valves, and other pipe fittings. When accurate K-factors are used, the flow rate and corresponding energy at any location in a pipe network can be calculated. K-factors are well defined for most pipe junctions and fittings; however, the literature documents no complete listings of K-factors for crosses. This study was commissioned to determine the K-factors {{for a wide range of}} flow combinations in a single pipe cross and the results provide information previously unavailable to compute energy losses associated with crosses. To obtain the loss coefficients, experimental data were collected in which the flow distribution in each of the four cross legs was varied to quantify the influence of velocity and flow distribution on head loss. For each data point the appropriate K-factors were calculated, resulting in over one thousand experimental K-factors that can be used in the design and analysis of piping systems containing crosses...|$|R
40|$|Essential to the {{emergence}} of spin-based electronics is a source of highly polarized electron spins. Conventional ferromagnets have at best a spin polarization P- 50 %. Europium monoxide is a novel material capable of generating a highly spin-polarized current when used as a tunnel barrier. EuO is both a Heisenberg ferromagnet (Tc= 69 K) and a semiconductor. Exchange splitting of the conduction band creates different tunnel barrier heights for spin-up and spin-down electrons, thus filtering the spins during tunneling. High-quality EuO films at the monolayer level is necessary for efficient spin-filtering. Because non-ferromagnetic, insulating Eu 20 forms more readily, growth of an ultra-thin, high-quality film is quite challenging, which restricted previous studies of EuO to bulk form. EuO films were grown by reactive thermal evaporation, and various thin film characterization techniques were employed to determine the structural, optical, and magnetic properties, even on the thickness scale needed for tunneling (< 3 nm). The film properties closely matched those of bulk EuO, though the Tc for ultra-thin films was found to be reduced from bulk value, in agreement with theoretical prediction. (cont.) Controlling the smoothness and chemical nature of the inter-faces between EuO and metallic electrodes was found to be of critical importance, as proven by careful interfacial chemical and magnetic analysis at the monolayer level, using x-ray absorption spectroscopy, magnetic circular dichroism, and diffuse x-ray resonance scattering techniques. EuO was successfully prepared as the barrier in Al/ 2. 5 nm EuO/Y tunnel <b>junctions.</b> By <b>fitting</b> the current-voltage characteristics of these junctions to tunneling theory, exchange splitting in an ultra-thin layer of EuO was quantitatively determined for the first time, and complete spin filtering yielded total spin polarization, P= 100 %. In an alternative approach, P was directly measured using the superconducting Al electrode as a spin detector. Spin-filtering in EuO barriers was also observed in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), in which a ferromagnetic electrode was the spin detector. In Cu/EuO/Gd MTJs a tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) of 280 % was measured by changing the relative alignment of magnetization of EuO and Gd, which is the largest TMR measured using a spin-filter barrier. Co/A 1203 /EuO/Y junctions, in which the A 1203 barrier magnetically decoupled Co and EuO, also showed substantial TMR. Its matching band gap (1. 1 eV) and compatibility with Si open up the novel possibility of using EuO to inject highly polarized spins into Si-based semiconductors. by Tiffany S. Santos. Thesis (Ph.
