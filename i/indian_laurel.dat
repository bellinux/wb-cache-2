[...] These plazas cover an area of 24,000m2, which were renovated, along with the areas around them in 2008. The green areas were rehabilitated, and areas were paved with red and black volcanic stone. [...] Renovation of the two plazas and the streets around them cost 88.3 million pesos. For over twenty five years, these plazas, especially Plaza Hidalgo, and the streets around them were filled with vendors (wandering and with stalls). When renovation efforts began, 150 vendors {{were removed from the}} plazas proper with about 500 total including the surrounding streets. [...] While the practice was illegal, it had been tolerated by authorities, even though it caused damage to the plazas and caused traffic problems. [...] One of the main goals of the renovation work in 2008 was to remove these vendors and move them to a new crafts bazaar built nearby. Initially, opposition to the removal of the vendors came not only from the vendors themselves, but also from some neighborhood groups and local businesses who feared their removal would hurt tourism. When renovation work finished in 2009, police were assigned to the plazas to keep vendors from returning, leading to confrontations, both physically in the plazas and legally in the courts. The borough began to issue some permits for vendors, but there was opposition. Eventually, a group representing the vendors obtained a court order to allow forty vendors to return to the plazas, citing the history of tolerating such activity in the past. This order is still opposed by some neighborhood groups, but as of 2010, there are still a limited number of these vendors selling in the plazas.|$|E

It was completed in 1767, the same year that the Jesuits were expelled from New Spain. The new church remained abandoned until 1804, when the order was allowed to return and reclaim it. The order then worked to renovate the church, replacing Baroque elements for Neoclassical ones, which were then in fashion. It has a façade with narrow estipite columns in Churrigueresque style, but its more famous aspect is a colossal cupola with three levels, which was added in the 19th century by architect Vicente Heredia. Inside, a collection of 180 paintings were recently studied and restored. Some of these paintings are displayed in the church complex, while the rest are kept in a pinacotheca created for the purpose. The main altar and the paintings are by Miguel Cabrera.|$|R

5000|$|The {{center of}} Coyoacán is {{relatively}} peaceful during the week, but it becomes crowded and festive {{on weekends and}} holidays. After the Zocalo, the most-visited place in Mexico City is this historic center, especially the twin plazas in its center. According to the borough, the area receives about 70,000 people each weekend. The area is a stop for both the Turibus and Tranvia Turistico tour bus routes, on their routes though San Ángel, Ciudad Universitaria and other locations {{in the south of}} Mexico City. People come to enjoy the still somewhat rural atmosphere of the area as well as the large number of restaurants, cafes, cantinas, museums, bookstores and other cultural attractions. Some of these businesses have been around for almost a century. In the two main plazas and even in smaller ones such as the one in the neighboring Santa Catarina neighborhood. Mimes, clowns, musicians, folk and indigenous dancers, storytellers and other street performers can be found entertaining crowds. [...] Vendors sell street food such as ice cream, homemade fruit drinks, esquites (flavored corn kernels) and corn-on-the-cob served with mayonnaise, lime, chili pepper and grated cheese, amaranth bars, and various candies. In the evening, food vendors tend to sell more hot items such as quesadillas, sopes, tortas, tostadas, pozoles and more. One known food vendor goes by the name of Rogelio. He is known for making pancakes (called hotcakes) in the shape of animals and humans. These are usually eaten as a snack with jam, cream and other toppings. [...] 12 15 22 5~The tourism has been a mixed blessing for the historic center as commercial establishments open, helping the economy, but also push residents out. In the historic center, there are over 860 retail businesses, mostly restaurants, about 200 of which were established in the last five years. Residents attribute the growth to Mexico City’s promotion of the area tourism in general as well as the opening of commercial centers in the borough. While the growing business helps the economy, resident groups fear that the area will lose its current character, as many businesses are opening in formerly residential buildings, with questionable legal basis. Currently, most of the borough, especially in historic center, is residential with older adults. Property prices are high, leading to sales not to new families but rather to larger commercial interests, squeezing out smaller businesses along with residents. Neighborhood groups have formed to confront the changes and preserve the historic value of the area. Another serious problem for the area is the traffic jams and serious lack of parking in the historic center. The quantity of cars and the lack of traffic patrols have meant the proliferation of “franeleros” or people who illegally take possession of public areas such as streets to charge for parking.The historic area is centered on two large plazas filled with <b>Indian</b> <b>laurel</b> trees called the Jardin del Centenario and the Jardín Hidalgo.

30|$|The {{potential}} {{utility of}} many species for NTFPs (in addition to timber) largely explained their presence and/or relative abundance within HPC-forest. Native species which were valued for food (fruits, nuts or seeds) were cultivated and/or promoted by local villagers since time immemorial, and were additionally favoured during government-sponsored forest restoration {{activities in the}} 1980 s and 1990 s. Amongst the thirty most important species were the highly valued fruit tree species Morinda citrifolia (Indian mulberry or noni), Garcinia cochinchinensis (false mangosteen), Scaphium macropodum (Vietnamese malva nut), Syzygium jambos (Malabar plum), Artocarpus rigidus (monkey jackfruit), Canarium album (Chinese olive), Litsea glutinosa (<b>Indian</b> <b>laurel),</b> and Pometia pinnata (island lychee) (Table  3). The three non-native species found in HPC-forest were economically valuable either for fruits (Morus alba - white mulberry, native to China; fairly common, IVIR 35; Nephelium lappaceum - rambutan, native to Malesia; one tree recorded) or camphor wax (Cinnamomum camphora - camphor laurel, native to Taiwan; two trees). The presence of valuable trees does obviously not entail that nearby communities actually collected and used all potentially available NTFPs, nor that they still tended the tree resources in sustainable ways. For example, malva nut trees (S. macropodum; IVIR 18, with highest woody biomass; Table  3), often appeared to be damaged, presumably because the nuts were harvested by cutting entire branches (YT Van, pers. obs.; Huy 2012).|$|E
