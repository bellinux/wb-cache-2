I would take the village priests, and maire too, so as {{to carry out the}} same plan that acted so well at Toulouse.

40|$|This {{final chapter}} {{highlights}} the primary learnings {{identified by the}} 20 chapters in this book and discusses {{the importance of these}} issues for researchers and employers both within the Asia Pacific and more globally. The chapter emphasizes the high quality research conducted to date by Asia Pacific scholars and identifies the essential considerations that future research should adopt to ensure it remains both competitive and respected globally. Finally, this chapter discusses the complex but extremely rich research opportunities available for researchers within this region. We encourage scholars near and afar to <b>join</b> <b>us</b> on what <b>will</b> undoubtedly be an exciting growth period for psychosocial work-related research within the Asia Pacific.

While many people see {{a conflict between}} economic development and environmental protection, I believe that when you come closer to nature {{to learn more about}} it, you will find no real conflict between the two. On the contrary, a deteriorating environment makes economic development a 'mission impossible.'

In Volume 1 Issue 47, the Turtles and Time Mistress Renet traveled to a time prior to the Foot's creation. There, Raphael met Sato and Oshi, and, not realising who they are, he taught them about Ninjutsu. After the Turtles returned to the present, Sato and Oshi decided to follow {{the ways of the}} ninja. Oshi declared: [...] "We must never again mention the strange shelled creatures. In time, others <b>will</b> <b>join</b> <b>us</b> and we <b>will</b> become {{a force to be reckoned}} with.

2500|$|Su Ze {{called for}} a meeting with Hao Zhao, Wei Ping, his {{subordinates}} and his Qiang allies to discuss {{how to deal with the}} rebellions. He told them: [...] "Although the rebels have superiority in numbers, they are nothing more than a motley crowd. As some of them have been forced to join the rebellion, they aren't necessarily as united as they seem. We should exploit their differences and make them split into 'good' and 'bad' camps. We shall then induce those in the 'good' camp to <b>join</b> <b>us.</b> This <b>will</b> boost our numbers and reduce theirs. Once we have increased our numbers, our morale will increase as well. By then, we should be able to defeat the rebels easily. If we do nothing now and wait for reinforcements to arrive, by then it'll be much more difficult to separate the rebels into 'good' and 'bad' camps and turn those in the 'good' camp to our side. Although we have no authorisation from the imperial court, given the current circumstances, I don't think it's unreasonable for us to exercise our own judgment and act accordingly." ...|$|R
40|$|This {{first part}} of my thesis {{consists}} {{of a collection of}} stories from my and my wife's families. These stories are told as I received them. They are inherently different in content, time, and purpose. They are important in helping me find out who my ancestors were, what they were like, and what they did. The second part of my thesis is genealogy, researched by myself. First are pedigree (family tree) charts which show family members who are directly related to my wife and me. Next are family group sheets which show all information that I have (full name, birth date and place, marriage date and place, death date and place, spouse(s), children, etc.). My wife's and my families are <b>joined</b> by <b>us.</b> We <b>will</b> eventually have children and add further to our family histories. This thesis unites our two families and binds them as one.
