50|$|Mitral valve {{prolapse}} (MVP; a.k.a. <b>floppy</b> <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> syndrome, systolic click murmur syndrome or billowing mitral leaflet) is a valvular {{heart disease}} characterized by the displacement of an abnormally thickened mitral valve leaflet into the left atrium during systole. It is the primary form of myxomatous degeneration of the valve. There are various types of MVP, broadly classified as classic and nonclassic. In its nonclassic form, MVP carries a low risk of complications and often can be kept minimal by dietary attention. In severe cases of classic MVP, complications include mitral regurgitation, infective endocarditis, congestive heart failure, and, in rare circumstances, cardiac arrest.|$|E

40|$|Prior to {{the advent}} of {{electron}} microscopy, polarised light was commonly used in structural research. New microscopical and mathematical methods have made the techniques worthy of reappraisal. I used quantative polarised light microscopy to examine tissue structure at both the fibre and molecular level. Birefringent materials, those with an anisotropic molecular organisation (such as collagen, muscle and elastin), can be studied using polarised light. The optical properties of birefringent materials {{were used to determine}} fibre orientation. Two-dimensional orientation was measured on the planar rotating microscope stage and three-dimensional orientation on a Universal stage. Molecular organisation, which affects optical anisotropy, was assessed by measuring the path-difference or retardation when linearly polarised light passes through birefringent materials. Five projects, focussing on collagen and muscle in cardiovascular tissues, were undertaken to demonstrate the usefulness of polarised light microscopy in structural studies.;I measured the two-dimensional orientation of cardiac muscle fibres in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and developed a quantitative method to complement the current qualitative method of diagnosis. I used the Universal stage to measure the orientation of collagen fibres in brain arteries and found that the fibres were predominantly circumferentially aligned at normal systolic pressures, but, at higher pressures a population of fibres had large longitudinal components of orientation. I measured the retardation in scar collagen produced following myocardial infarction and found that changes in the optical properties of collagen could be detected for at least six weeks after its production. A measured difference in retardation in tendons from <b>floppy</b> <b>mitral</b> <b>valves,</b> indicated that degraded collagen can also be detected using polarised light. Both fibre orientation and molecular organisation were assessed in cerebral saccular aneurysms. The aneurysm wall was layered and the collagen fibres were organised in a complex three-dimensional weave, suggesting a strong structure; however, the retardation in the aneurysm was lower than normal, indicating less molecular organisation and a possible reason why aneurysms enlarge and rupture.;The general conclusion is that quantitative polarised light mircoscopy remains an effective method in structural analysis...|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 30 surgically resected {{complete}} mitral valves were examined, without {{prior knowledge of}} the clinical history, to evaluate the reliability of gross inspection only for the correct morphological diagnosis. Twenty valves were rheumatic; 10 were obtained from patients with idiopathic mitral valve prolapse. Two groups were identified: group I correlated with a rheumatic history; group II showed floppy mitral valves, which correlated with mitral valve prolapse. Hence, it is considered that the diagnosis of rheumatic or <b>floppy</b> <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> can be established accurately upon gross examination only. The rheumatic valve is fibrotic and firm, leading to thickening and fusion of leaflets and commissures. Narrowing and lowering of the "principal" ostium occurs. This results in a funnel-shaped valve, which is further accentuated by interchordal fusion. Rigidity is its hallmark. Chordal rupture is unlikely. Calcification can be found anywhere in the valve. Hooding is extremely unusual. The floppy valve, by contrast, shows laxity of leaflets, which {{may lead to the}} formation of dome-like deformities reaching above the level of the annulus. The chordae are often thin, attenuated, and may have ruptured. The distribution of chordae and mode of anchoring is often chaotic. Fibrosis occurs mainly at the anchoring sites of the chordae underneath or at the margin of the leaflet, or where previously ruptured, intertwined chordae are plastered underneath the dome. Fibrosis is further aggravated at the margins and atrial surface of the leaflets because of regurgitant friction. In spite of fibrosis, the floppy valve remains soft and flexible. Commissural fusion is absent. Interchordal fusion is not a characteristic feature of the <b>floppy</b> <b>mitral</b> <b>valve.</b> Gross inspection will not only correctly discriminate between a rheumatic and <b>floppy</b> <b>mitral</b> <b>valve,</b> but may also contribute {{to an understanding of the}} pathogenesis of the valve deformit...|$|E

MethodsWe performed resting and exercise echocardiography in 70 patients matched for indexed effective orifice area, systolic pulmonary arterial pressure, and left ventricular ejection fraction after <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> annuloplasty or <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement with coronary artery bypass grafting. ResultsThere was no significant difference between the 2 groups regarding baseline demographic and clinical data.

40|$|AbstractObjectives: We {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the long-term results of mitral valve repair in patients with mitral regurgitation caused by floppy mitral valves and compare the outcomes of asymptomatic patients with those of symptomatic patients. Methods: A retrospective review of 488 consecutive patients who had mitral valve repair for <b>floppy</b> <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> disclosed 199 patients who were asymptomatic or had minimal symptoms and 289 patients who were symptomatic {{at the time of}} the operation. Asymptomatic patients were younger, had better ventricular function, had a lower incidence of coronary artery disease, and had higher rates of atrial fibrillation than symptomatic patients. Results: Survival at 15 years was 61 % for all patients. Survival was 76 % for asymptomatic patients, which was identical to that for the general population matched for age and sex, whereas the survival of symptomatic patients was 53 % and significantly lower than that of the general population. Cox regression analyses validated by means of bootstrap methodology identified the following predictors of late death: age by increments of 5 years (risk ratio = 1. 2), New York Heart Association functional classes 3 and 4 (risk ratio = 3. 0), left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 40 % (risk ratio = 2. 7), preoperative stroke or transient ischemic attack (risk ratio = 3. 1), previous cardiac operation (risk ratio = 4. 6), and severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (risk ratio = 3. 1). Freedom from reoperation at 15 years was 91 %, and it was similar for asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Freedom from mitral regurgitation of greater than 2 + at 15 years was 85 % for all patients, 96 % for asymptomatic patients, and 76 % for symptomatic patients.

A study on two dimensional echocardiography images has been conducted and the correlations between the backflow volume of the mitral regurgitation and <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> leaflet Young modulus have been obtained.

40|$|Mitral valve {{prolapse}} (MVP) {{results from}} the systolic movement of a portion(s) or segment(s) of the mitral valve leaflet(s) into the left atrium during left ventricular (LV) systole. It should be emphasised that MVP alone, as defined by imaging techniques, may comprise a non-specific finding because it also depends on the LV volume, myocardial contractility and other LV hemodynamics. Thus, a <b>floppy</b> <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> (FMV) should {{be the basis for}} the diagnosis of MVP. Two types of symptoms may be defined in these patients. In one group, symptoms are directly related to progressive mitral regurgitation and its complications. In the other group, symptoms cannot be explained only by the degree of mitral regurgitation alone; neuroendocrine dysfunction has been implicated for the explanation of symptoms in this group of patients that today is referred as the FMV/MVP syndrome. When significant mitral regurgitation is present in a patient with FMV/MVP, surgical intervention is recommended. In patients with a prohibitive risk for surgery, transcatheter mitral valve repair using a mitraclip device may be considered.

40|$|AbstractHypertrophic {{cardiomyopathy}} and {{mitral valve}} prolapse are both conditions that may be genetically transmitted and incur a risk for sudden cardiac death. Although the small left ventricular cavity and distorted geometry characteristic of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy might suggest a predisposition to {{mitral valve prolapse}}, {{the frequency with which}} these two entities coexist and the potential clinical significance of such an association are not known. To further define the relation of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and mitral valve prolapse, 528 consecutive patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were studied by echocardiography. Patients ranged in age from 1 to 86 years (mean 45); 335 (63 %) were male. Unequivocal echocardiographic evidence of systolic mitral valve prolapse into the left atrium was identified in only 16 (3 %) of the 528 patients. The mitral valve excised at operation from three of the patients had morphologic characteristics of a <b>floppy</b> <b>mitral</b> <b>valve,</b> which was judged to be responsible for the echocardiographic findings. Occurrence of clinically evident atrial fibrillation was common in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and mitral valve prolapse (9 [56 %] of 16). Hence, in a large group of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the association of echocardiographically documented mitral valve prolapse was uncommon.

Semi-quantitative analysis of the location of type I collagen, type I procollagen, MMP- 1, TIMP- 1, TGF-~ and decorin were described within the layers. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) immunogold analysis was used to investigate the location of decorin, which is involved in collagen fibrillogenesis, in the abnormal leaflets.

This study compared morphologic features, associated lesions, and palliation strategies of the two parachute <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> and dominant papillary muscle types and examined interventions and midterm outcomes in patients with biventricular circulation. MethodsEchocardiography and autopsy databases were reviewed to identify patients with “true” parachute <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> or parachute-like asymmetric <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> from January 1987 to January 2006. Predictors of palliation strategy in the entire cohort, mitral stenosis on initial echocardiogram, and mortality in the biventricular cohort were determined with logistic regression.

Supra-annular prosthesis implantation can facilitate <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement with a larger prosthesis in children with a small annulus, but little is known about its effect on the outcomes of <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement {{in young children}}. MethodsOne hundred eighteen children underwent <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement at 5 years of age or younger from 1976 – 2006. <b>Mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement was supra-annular in 37 (32 %) patients.

Factors associated with worse survival included earlier <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement date, age less than 1 year, complete atrioventricular canal, and additional procedures at <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement, but not supra-annular <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement. As survival improved during our more recent experience, the risks of supra-annular <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement became apparent; survival was worse among patients with a supra-annular prosthesis after 1991.

40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{the study}} is to {{describe}} gross and histological features of operatively excised portions of mitral valves in patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP). BackgroundAlthough numerous articles on MVP (myxomatous or myxoid degeneration, billowing or <b>floppy</b> <b>mitral</b> <b>valve)</b> have appeared, 2 virtually constant histological features have been underemphasized or overlooked: 1) the presence of superimposed fibrous tissue on both surfaces of the leaflets and surrounding many chordae tendineae; and 2) the absence of many chordae tendineae on the ventricular surfaces of the leaflets as the result of their being hidden (i. e., covered up) by the superimposed fibrous tissue. MethodsWe examined operatively excised portions of prolapsed posterior mitral leaflets in 37 patients having operative repair. ResultsHistological study of elastic-tissue stained sections disclosed that the leaflet thickening was primarily due to the superimposed fibrous tissue. All leaflets had variable increases in the spongiosa element within the leaflet itself with some disruption and/or loss of the fibrosa element and occasionally complete separation of it from the spongiosa element. Both the leaflet and chordae were separated from the superimposed fibrous tissue by their black-staining elastic membranes. ConclusionsThese findings demonstrate that the posterior leaflet thickening in MVP is mainly due to the superimposed fibrous tissue rather than to an increased volume of the spongiosa element of the leaflet itself. The superimposed fibrous tissue on both leaflet and chordae is likely the result of subsequent abnormal contact of the leaflets and chordae with one another. Chordal rupture (i. e., missing chordae) occurred in all 37 patients, but finding individual ruptured chords was rare...|$|E
40|$|Mitral valve lesions {{accompanying}} secundum atrial septal defect {{were examined}} in 120 successive patients from May 1978 to December 1980 using real time two dimensional echocardiography. The conclusions were as follows: (1) The characteristic feature of the mitral lesion accompanying secundum atrial septal defect is a dislocation of the mitral leaflet toward the left atrial side {{in the area of}} coaptation. (2) The mitral lesion is seen in about half the patients with secundum atrial septal defect. (3) It is usually seen only in the anterior leaflet, and is found near the posteromedial commissure. Lesions in other sites on the leaflet all accompany those near the posteromedial commissure. (4) The incidence, extent, and degree of the mitral valve lesion increase with age. (5) It is assumed that the mitral valve lesion in secundum atrial septal defect starts near the posteromedial commissure in the anterior leaflet, gradually deteriorates, and extends toward the anterolateral commissure. (6) It is probable that the mitral lesion results in mitral regurgitation. (7) The mitral valve lesion is similar in appearance to mitral valve prolapse caused by the <b>floppy</b> <b>mitral</b> <b>valve,</b> though their causative factors may be different. It is probably the reason why the mitral valve abnormality has been described as mitral valve prolapse in previous reports. In the present study the mitral lesion was evaluated on the distance of the dislocation between both leaflets at the area of coaptation. These criteria proved useful. Because of the similarity in appearance, it may be helpful in the assessment of primary mitral valve prolapse...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundCertain {{patients}} with <b>floppy</b> <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> (FMV) /mitral valve prolapse (MVP) may have symptoms that cannot be explained on {{the severity of}} mitral valvular regurgitation (MVR) alone; hypersensitivity to adrenergic stimulation has been suggested in this group defined as the FMV/MVP syndrome. MethodsNinety-eight patients (75 men, 23 women) with mitral valve surgery for FMV/MVP were studied. Of those 41 (42 %) had symptoms consistent with FMV/MVP syndrome [29 men (39 %), 12 women (52 %) ]; median age of symptom onset was 30 years (range 10 – 63 years) and median duration of symptoms prior to valve surgery was 16 years (range 3 – 50 years). Ninety-nine individuals (70 men, 29 women) without clinical evidence of any disease were used as controls. Genotyping of β 1 and β 2 adrenergic receptors was performed. Resultsβ-Adrenergic receptor genotypes (β 1 and β 2) were similar between control and overall FMV/MVP patients. Subgroup analysis of patients, however, demonstrated that the genotype C/C at position 1165 resulting in 389 Arg/Arg of the β 1 receptor was more frequent in women compared to those without FMV/MVP syndrome and to normal control women (p< 0. 025). This polymorphism {{may be related to}} hypersensitivity to adrenergic stimulation as reported previously in these patients. ConclusionThis study shows a large proportion of {{patients with}} FMV/MVP, predominantly women, had symptoms consistent with the FMV/MVP syndrome for many years prior to the development of significant MVR, and thus symptoms cannot be attributed to the severity of MVR alone. Further, women with FMV/MVP syndrome, symptoms at least partially may be related to β 1 -adrenergic receptor polymorphism, which has been shown previously to be associated with a hyperresponse to adrenergic stimulation...|$|E
40|$|Valve {{replacement}} {{in patients}} with <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> regurgitation is indicated when symptoms occur or left ventricular function becomes impaired.

With transoesophageal echocardiography a segmental analysis of the entire <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> can be performed; <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> motion abnormalities and severity and direction of the regurgitation jet can be judged.

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of the floppy valve {{syndrome is}} not fully solved. An almost invariable histological finding is the great accumulation of mucinous material in the valve leaflets and constitutes {{the basis of the}} valvular theory of the syndrome. The presence of a mucinous layer in normal valves [...] the zona spongiosa [...] is not well recognised. To establish the normal range of the extent of this zone, 50 excised mitral valves from patients aged 2 to 89 years and who {{died as a result of}} road traffic accidents or non-cardiac causes have been analysed by measuring the thickness of the zone in relation to the valve thickness. A range of 0 to 60 per cent was found and this was not influenced by age. The findings were compared with 50 patients clinically diagnosed as suffering from the {{floppy valve syndrome}}. A value of over 60 per cent (range 62 to 94 %) was found in 43 patients. The increase in the extent of the mucinous material was considered to be a secondary change in the thickened fibrosa which normally accompanies the floppy valve syndrome. Measurements of zona spongiosa falling within the normal range were found in seven patients. The clinical features, complications, and accompanying conditions have also been analysed. Chordal rupture had occurred in 20 patients, infective endocarditis in three, and calcification was found in four valves. In four patients the aortic valve was also involved and accompanying aortic root dilatation in an additional patient. It is suggested that these patients should not be included in the group of Marfan's forme fruste, nor in the typical <b>floppy</b> <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> syndrome. Apart from the valvular theory, the myocardial theory in the pathogenesis of the syndrome has been discussed and the components ensuring normal mitral valve function have been reviewed. It is concluded that an inherent, prominent zona spongiosa predisposes to the floppy valve syndrome, particularly if any one of the components of normal valve function is abnormal...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Problems {{that occur}} in the <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> are now {{worrying}} an increasing number of patients each day. In the <b>mitral</b> <b>valve,</b> regional variations in structure and material properties combine to affect the biomechanics of the entire valve. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> leaflet tissue is highly extensible. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between the rigidity of <b>mitral</b> <b>valves</b> leaflet and backflow problems. Two stages of <b>mitral</b> <b>valves</b> analysis systolic and diastolic condition and also with and without ventricle were investigated. 2 D models of the <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> leaflet (MVL) were created in ADINA-FSI for computational fluid dynamic analysis. The results show a linear relationship between rigidity of the <b>mitral</b> <b>valves</b> leaflet and volume of backflow. In conclusion, these computational techniques are very useful in the study of both <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> leaflet disease and failure of prostheses...|$|R
40|$|Abstract <b>Mitral</b> <b>valve</b> {{prolapse}} is {{a benign}} condition. Mitral regurgitation is only complicated {{in patients with}} severe <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> prolapse. Women with <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> prolapse {{in the absence of}} other cardiovascular disorders tolerate pregnancy well and do not develop remarkable cardiac complications. Nevertheless, serious complications of <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> prolapse, including arrhythmia, infective endocarditis and cerebral ischemic events, can be present in pregnancy. Debates remain with regard to the use of prophylactic antibiotics and β-blockers in the pregnant women with <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> prolapse. The prognosis of the pregnant patients might be closely related to the pathological and (or) functional changes of the <b>mitral</b> <b>valve.</b> Non-myxomatous <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> prolapse poses no or little obstetric risks in terms of pregnancy, labor and neonatal complications; whereas myxomatous <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> prolapse is a major etiology of valvular heart disease in women of childbearing age. In the pregnant patients with <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> prolapse progressing into major complications, surgical interventions are considered. Medicinal treatment of such patients with β-blockers should be a concern for the fetal safety...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: We {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether the Cox maze procedure provides additional benefit to patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> operations. Methods: Between May 1992 and August 2000, we performed 258 Cox maze procedures with <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement (n = 147) or <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> repair (n = 111). We compared the outcomes of these patients with those of 61 control patients with preoperative atrial fibrillation who underwent <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement alone during the same interval. The three cohorts were similar in age, sex, and proportion of patients in preoperative New York Heart Association functional class 3 or 4. Results: Although 5 -year survivals were similar among the groups (94 % for <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement alone, 95 % for <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement plus maze, and 97 % for <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> repair plus maze), freedoms from atrial fibrillation at 5 years were significantly higher in the <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement plus maze group (78 %) and the <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> repair plus maze group (81 %) than in the <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement group (6 %, P <. 0001). Freedoms from stroke at 5 years were 97 % for the <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement plus maze group, 97 % for the <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> repair plus maze group, and only 79 % for <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> replacement group (P <. 0001). Multivariable analysis with Cox hazard model revealed that the most significant risk factor for late stroke was the omission of the Cox maze procedure (P =. 003). Conclusions: The addition of the Cox maze procedure to <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> repair and replacement was safe and effective for selected patients. Elimination of atrial fibrillation significantly decreased the incidence of late stroke. J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2002; 124 : 575 - 8...|$|R

40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} in 13 patients with idiopathic <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> prolapse and in 21 control subjects to assess {{the effect of the}} cold pressor test on systolic motion of the <b>mitral</b> <b>valve.</b> A significant increase in blood pressure occurred in 10 patients with <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> prolapse and in 19 controls after immersion of one hand in ice-cold water. M-mode echocardiographic recordings from the <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> were obtained in all patients before, during, and after the cold pressor test, together with simultaneous phonocardiograms in selected patients. Nine out of 10 patients with <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> prolapse and a hypertensive response to the cold stimulus showed {{a significant increase in the}} depth of <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> prolapse during the cold pressor test whereas in three patients with <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> prolapse and no hypertensive response the depth of <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> prolapse did not change during cold stimulation. Three patients with previously demonstrated <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> prolapse had equivocal resting echocardiograms but developed diagnostic evidence of <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> prolapse during the cold pressor test. No evidence of <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> prolapse was seen in any of the control subjects before, during or after the cold pressor test. In four patients with <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> prolapse and a hypertensive response to cold stimulation the systolic click was delayed by the cold pressor test, whereas the time of the systolic click remained constant in the three patients whose blood pressure did not increase. It is concluded that the cold pressor test provides a stimulus sufficient to delay the onset and increase the depth of <b>mitral</b> <b>valve</b> prolapse, thereby enhancing the diagnostic sensitivity of echocardiography in this condition...|$|R
