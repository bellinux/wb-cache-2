40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>empowering</b> {{leadership}} has {{attracted the attention}} of both academics and practitioners because of its important role in enhancing employee performance. Although empirical evidence clearly demonstrates that <b>empowering</b> leadership can {{have a significant effect on}} positive managerial outcomes, there is a paucity of research on its antecedents and processes through which it influences work outcomes. Thus, this study suggests a comprehensive conceptual model of <b>empowering</b> leadership, mainly focusing on the trickle-down effects of across levels of hierarchy. Specifically, based on theories of social learning and social exchange, this study examines the influence of <b>empowering</b> leadership of second-level leaders on subordinates’ various work outcomes through first-level leaders’ <b>empowering</b> leadership to help identify mediating process that may underlie relationships between second-level leaders and subordinates’ outcomes. Additionally, in order to explore the social learning of <b>empowering</b> leadership in detail, this study focuses on the antecedents and processes of <b>empowering</b> leadership learning. Data were obtained from subordinate–supervisor dyads from the South Korean Army. The results of this study showed mediating effects of first-level leaders’ <b>empowering</b> leadership on the relationship between second-level leaders’ <b>empowering</b> leadership and subordinates’ task performance, organizational citizenship behaviors, and social loafing. These results support the trickle-down effects of <b>empowering</b> leadership on subordinates’ outcomes. Moreover, LLX mediates the relationship between second-level leaders’ <b>empowering</b> leadership and the first-level leaders’ <b>empowering</b> leadership, and this result supports the social learning of <b>empowering</b> leadership. Exchange ideology also moderated the social learning of <b>empowering</b> leadership, such that the relationship was stronger when exchange ideology was low rather than high. The results of this study have both theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, this study provides empirical evidence to help determine whether second-level leaders’ <b>empowering</b> leadership facilitates first-level leaders’ <b>empowering</b> leadership. This study contributes to the literature by further examining the antecedents of <b>empowering</b> leadership by showing how relational, individual, and situational factors influence <b>empowering</b> leadership. This study also explains how <b>empowering</b> leadership can spread across multiple downward linkages by supporting the existence of “trickle-down effects” of <b>empowering</b> leadership. Practically, this study helps understand the importance of high-level leaders’ <b>empowering</b> leadership to facilitate their low-level leaders’ <b>empowering</b> leadership. This study also suggests the importance of relational, individual, and contextual factors to facilitate the social learning of <b>empowering</b> leadership. In conclusion, <b>empowering</b> leadership has a synergistic effect across leadership levels; therefore, top managers and high-level leaders should focus on training <b>empowering</b> leadership of field managers and leading by example to create a more <b>empowering</b> environment. However, this study has limitations, such as the use of cross-sectional analyses and perceptual data. Future research may seek to use longitudinal and objective measures...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{describe}} and evaluate nursing students' learning about an <b>empowering</b> discourse in patient education. In Phase 1, the purpose was to describe an <b>empowering</b> discourse between a nurse and a patient. In Phase 2, the purpose was first to create a computer simulation program of an <b>empowering</b> discourse based on the description, and second, the purpose was to evaluate nursing students’ learning of how to conduct an <b>empowering</b> discourse using a computer simulation program. The ultimate goal was to strengthen the knowledge basis on <b>empowering</b> discourse and to develop nursing students’ knowledge about how to conduct an <b>empowering</b> discourse for the development of patient education. In Phase I, <b>empowering</b> discourse was described using a systematic literature review with a metasummary technique (n= 15). Data were collected covering a period from January 1995 to October 2005. In Phase 2, the computer simulation program of <b>empowering</b> discourse was created based the description in 2006 – 2007. A descriptive comparative design was used to evaluate students’ (n= 69) process of learning <b>empowering</b> discourse using the computer simulation program and a pretest–post-test design without a control group was used to evaluate students’ (n= 43) outcomes of learning. Data were collected in 2007. <b>Empowering</b> discourse was a structured process and it was possible to simulate and learned with the computer simulation program. According to students’ knowledge, <b>empowering</b> discourse was an unstructured process. Process of learning <b>empowering</b> discourse using the computer simulation program was controlled by the students and it changed students’ knowledge. The outcomes of learning <b>empowering</b> discourse appeared as changes of students’ knowledge to more holistic and better-organized or only to more holistic or better-organized. The study strengthened knowledge base of <b>empowering</b> discourse and developed students to more knowledgeable in <b>empowering</b> discourse...|$|R

40|$|The present {{dissertation}} {{tries to}} shed light on the phenomenon of <b>empowering</b> leadership. We aim to understand the antecedents of leader <b>empowering</b> behaviour. In doing so, we mean to remedy the stated lack of research on <b>empowering</b> leadership and on the effect of follower’s behaviour on leader’s behaviour. In this dissertation we will argue that follower’s behaviour can be expected {{to play an important role}} in explaining leader’s <b>empowering</b> behaviour. We report the findings of 4 laboratory studies and two field studies. As a first step in our reasoning we start by establishing trust as an antecedent of leader <b>empowering</b> behaviour and showing that leader’s characteristics moderate the influence of trust in the <b>empowering</b> process. We then investigate the influence of trust and epistemic motivation in the <b>empowering</b> process. We focused on two aspects of epistemic motivation: accountability and workload. We finally investigate the influence of trust and gender in the <b>empowering</b> process, emphasizing the mediating role of trust in the process...|$|R

The <b>empowering</b> outcomes that were experienced to the strongest degree were ‘being better informed’ and ‘enhanced social well-being’. No significant differences in <b>empowering</b> outcomes between diagnostic groups were found.
