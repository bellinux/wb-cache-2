5|$|In testing {{conducted}} by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in 1999, the SS190 fired from the P90 {{at a distance of}} 25m (27yd) exhibited an average penetration depth of 25cm (9.85in) in ballistic <b>gelatin</b> covered with a Level II vest. The SS190 exhibited penetration depths ranging from 28 to 34cm (11 to 13.5in) when fired from the P90 into bare ballistic <b>gelatin,</b> in tests {{conducted by}} Houston Police Department SWAT. In testing, the SS190 and similar 5.7×28mm projectiles consistently turn base over point ("tumble") as they pass through ballistic <b>gelatin</b> and other media, using the 21.6-mm (.85in) projectile length to create a larger wound cavity. However, some are skeptical of the bullet's terminal performance, and it is a subject of debate among civilian shooters in the United States.|$|E

40|$|Hydrolyzed <b>gelatins</b> (Byco-A, Byco-O and Byco-C), {{when used}} as binders, yielded soft, uniform {{granules}} with good flow properties. As the molecular weight and viscosity of hydrolyzed <b>gelatins</b> increased, the compressibility of granules decreased and their compactability increased. The balance between compressibility and compactability of granules may {{be achieved by}} careful monitoring of the molecular weight of hydrolyzed <b>gelatins</b> that can serve as potential binders...|$|R
40|$|<b>Gelatins</b> were {{crosslinked}} {{with organic}} acids and treated with alkali to impart to them endothelialization and anti-thrombogenic properties. These matrices {{were characterized by}} biochemical and physicochemical techniques. The amounts of residual amino groups in the matrices decreased with increasing crosslinker concentration. The matrices with the highest crosslinking densities showed excellent endothelial cell adhesion and proliferation. In addition, the adhesion of platelets and formation of fibrin networks on the matrices were suppressed with increasing crosslinker concentration. The matrices also exhibited excellent biodegradability, and the degradation rate decreased with increasing crosslinking density. All the organic acid-crosslinked alkali-treated <b>gelatins</b> showed excellent anti-thrombogenic and endothelialization properties, superior to those of glutaraldehyde-crosslinked alkali-treated <b>gelatins...</b>|$|R
30|$|Dextran and gelatins: Other {{synthetic}} colloids (dextran and <b>gelatins)</b> are {{not well}} studied in the literature. Although {{there is no evidence}} showing harm beyond what is seen with other colloids, there is also no evidence showing benefit. In light of the lack of evidence, and the theoretical potential for adverse effect, the suggestion is not to use <b>gelatins</b> or dextran.|$|R

40|$|Used for the {{treatment}} of hypovolemia, colloid solutions have actually supplanted albumin solutions. These solutions of macromolecules include dextrans, <b>gelatins,</b> and hydroxyethyl starches (HES). All these synthetic colloids interfere with the physiologic mechanism of haemostasis causing a non specific alteration of coagulation correlated to the amount of haemodilution and associated with specific effects due to the macromolecules. However, these effects on haemostasis have little clinical impact provided safety measures are observed. These consist of strict observation of the maximal daily dosage and of the duration of treatment. Caution should be taken also in patients presenting with haemostasis abnormalities and with haemodilution greater than 30 % of patient's blood volume. Albumin could then be chosen for plasma expansion. Among the different types of macromolecules solutions, <b>gelatins</b> and low or medium molecular weight HES (LMWHES) have less effect on blood loss than dextrans or high molecular weight HES (HMWHES). The recently developed HES, 130 / 0. 4 (Voluven®) has less impact on haemostasis as compared with <b>gelatins,</b> increasing the authorized volume of administration to 50 mL/kg per day.

5|$|Some {{processes}} {{convert a}} meat or dairy product into a pareve (neither meat nor dairy) one. For example, rennet is sometimes made from stomach linings, yet is acceptable for making kosher cheese, but such cheeses {{might not be}} acceptable to some vegetarians, who would eat only cheese made from a vegetarian rennet. The same applies to kosher <b>gelatin,</b> an animal product, derived from kosher animal sources. Other gelatin-like products from non-animal sources such as agar agar and carrageenan are pareve by nature. Fish <b>gelatin</b> is derived from fish and is therefore (like all kosher fish products) pareve. Eggs are also considered pareve despite being an animal product.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other {{techniques}} developed in parallel {{with the use of}} daguerreotypes. The ambrotype, using collodium to produce a positive image on glass, and the pannotype, also collodium-based, were both used in Denmark from around 1855. Negative-based paper prints, used {{from the beginning of the}} 1850s, were produced on salt paper until around 1857 when salt was replaced by albumen. Collodion emulsion chloride paper was used from 1865 and in 1880 <b>gelatin</b> emulsion paper was introduced.|$|E

5|$|The {{photosensitivity}} of {{the silver}} halides allowed for their use in traditional photography, although digital photography, which does not use silver, is now dominant. The photosensitive emulsion used in black-and-white photography is a suspension of silver halide crystals in <b>gelatin,</b> possibly mixed in with some noble metal compounds for improved photosensitivity, developing, and tuning. Colour photography requires the addition of special dye components and sensitisers, so that the initial black-and-white silver image couples with a different dye component. The original silver images are bleached off and the silver is then recovered and recycled. Silver nitrate is the starting material in all cases.|$|E
5|$|During {{the era of}} the {{collodion}} process, {{before the}} arrival of less demanding photographic technology (the <b>gelatin</b> silver process, photographic film, and smaller cameras) and the consequent rise of amateur photography, commercial photographers like Farsari had a particular importance for recording events and views. In Japan before 1899 such photographers were even more significant because the government required foreigners to obtain passes to journey to the interior, and commercial photographers based in Japan could more easily gain access and provide rare images of restricted areas. By 1889, however, Farsari estimated that about half of all visitors to Yokohama were amateur photographers; even if this was an exaggeration, the presence of increasing numbers of amateur photographers was obviously affecting the commercial photography business. To encourage amateur photographers to visit his studio and possibly buy his merchandise, Farsari provided free use of a darkroom.|$|E
5|$|LocoRoco {{is divided}} into 5 worlds each {{consisting}} of 8 levels. In each level, {{the goal is to}} reach the end point of the level, with the player scored on the number of LocoRoco found, the time to complete the level, and other factors. There are six varieties of LocoRoco in the game, identified by their color, appearance, and musical voice, but outside of the first yellow one (Kulche), the rest are unlocked as the player completes the levels. The player can then opt which LocoRoco they want to use for a level, however, this selection has no fundamental gameplay effects and only changes the songs used. LocoRoco act as blobs of <b>gelatin,</b> deforming from their normally round shape when demanded by the environment. Certain beings in the world can change the default shape of the LocoRoco into other forms, such as squares or triangles, which lasts until they wash off in water or they encounter another similar being.|$|E

5|$|Sheepskin is {{likewise}} used for making clothes, footwear, rugs, and other products. Byproducts from {{the slaughter of}} sheep are also of value: sheep tallow {{can be used in}} candle and soap making, sheep bone and cartilage has been used to furnish carved items such as dice and buttons as well as rendered glue and <b>gelatin.</b> Sheep intestine can be formed into sausage casings, and lamb intestine has been formed into surgical sutures, as well as strings for musical instruments and tennis rackets. Sheep droppings, which are high in cellulose, have even been sterilized and mixed with traditional pulp materials to make paper. Of all sheep byproducts, perhaps the most valuable is lanolin: the waterproof, fatty substance found naturally in sheep's wool and used as a base for innumerable cosmetics and other products.|$|E
25|$|Collagen {{hydrolysis}} {{is performed}} {{by one of}} three different methods: acid-, alkali-, and enzymatic hydrolysis. Acid treatment is especially suitable for less fully crosslinked materials such as pig skin collagen and normally requires 10 to 48 hours. Alkali treatment is suitable for more complex collagen such as that found in bovine hides and requires more time, normally several weeks. The purpose of the alkali treatment is to destroy certain chemical crosslinks still present in collagen. Within the <b>gelatin</b> industry, the <b>gelatin</b> obtained from acid-treated raw material has been called type-A <b>gelatin</b> and the <b>gelatin</b> obtained from alkali-treated raw material {{is referred to as}} type-B <b>gelatin.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{first use}} of <b>gelatin</b> in foods is {{attributed}} to Medieval Britain (1400s) when cattle hooves were boiled to produce a gel. Further commercial development occurred in 1754 when a British manufacturing patent was issued. Food applications in the USA and France during 1800–1900 appear to have established the versatility of <b>gelatin,</b> including the origin of its popularity in the USA as Jell-O. Over middle-late 1800s, Charles and Rose Knox of New York manufactured and marketed <b>gelatin</b> powder, diversifying the appeal and applications of <b>gelatin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Polydextrose is {{commonly}} used {{as a replacement for}} sugar, starch, and fat in commercial beverages, cakes, candies, dessert mixes, breakfast cereals, <b>gelatins,</b> frozen desserts, puddings, and salad dressings.

40|$|Gelatinase B (matrix metalloproteinase- 9) is a {{secreted}} multidomain {{enzyme that}} {{is important for the}} remodeling of the extracellular matrix and the migration of normal and tumor cells. It cleaves denatured collagens (<b>gelatins)</b> and type IV collagen, which is present in basement membranes. In the immune system, this cleavage helps lymphocytes and other leukocytes to enter and leave the blood and lymph circulations. Gelatinase B also cleaves myelin basic protein and type II <b>gelatins,</b> and this clipping leads to remnant epitopes that generate autoimmunity, the so-called REGA model of autoimmunity. Recently, gelatinase B has been found to process cytokines and chemokines, resulting in skewed immune functions. Therefore, gelatinase B, often considered as a pure effector molecule, acts as a switch and catalyst in both innate and specific immunity, and constitutes a prototypic example of the regulation of immune functions by proteolysis. status: publishe...|$|R
