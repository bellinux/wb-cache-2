5|$|In February 2003, the PL {{board of}} {{directors}} agreed to reintroduce a playoff system {{to be used for}} the 2004 NPB season. If a first-place team had a substantial lead in the standings nearing the end of the regular season, there was no pennant (league champion) race and little excitement until the Japan Series began. The decision to add a PL playoff was an attempt to rectify this problem and increase the league's popularity. The new postseason plan initiated a two-stage playoff in which the top three PL teams competed. In the First Stage, the teams that finished the newly shortened, 135-game regular season with the second- and third-best records played each other in a best-of-three series. The winner of this series faced the league's top finisher in the second <b>final</b> <b>stage.</b> The <b>Final</b> <b>Stage</b> winner advanced to the Japan Series, where they competed against the CL's Climax Series champion team.|$|E
