25|$|Even {{today there}} are no road or rail {{crossings}} of the Bristol Channel, so direct crossings are necessarily made by sea or air, or less directly by the road and rail crossings via the River Severn estuary. The Channel can be a <b>hazardous</b> <b>area</b> of water because of its strong tides and the rarity of havens on the north Devon and Somerset coasts that can be entered in all states of the tide. Because of the treacherous waters, even today pilotage is an essential service for shipping.|$|E

On March 1, first lady Laura Bush visited Midway Atoll, and on March 2, a renaming ceremony was held at Washington Place in Honolulu, Hawaii. At the ceremony, Laura Bush and Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne announced the name change and helped raise public awareness about the monument. On May 15, 2007, President Bush announced his intention to submit the monument for Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA) status, which would [...] "alert mariners to exercise caution in the ecologically important, sensitive, and <b>hazardous</b> <b>area</b> they are entering." [...] In October 2007, the Marine Environmental Protection Committee of the International Maritime Organization designated the monument as a PSSA.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{industries}} which {{form the basis of}} Russian Economical structure is oil and gas. This industry is also playing a significant role for CIS countries. Oil and gas industry is developing intensively attracting foreign investments. This situation is providing sustainable development of machinery production for <b>hazardous</b> <b>areas.</b> Operating in oil and gas areas is always related with occurrence of explosion gas atmospheres. Machines for <b>hazardous</b> <b>areas</b> must be furnished with additional protection of different types. Explosion protection is regulated with standards according to which equipment must be manufactured. In Russia and CIS countries explosion-proof equipment must be constructed in compliance with GOST standards. To confirm that equipment is manufactured according to standards’ requirements and is safe and reliable it must undergo the approval procedure. Certification in Russia is governed by Federal Laws and legislation. Each CIS country has its own approval certificates and permissions for operating in <b>hazardous</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R
