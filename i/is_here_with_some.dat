40|$|Tidal {{evolution}} of globular clusters is regulated by both Galactic tidal effects and internal relaxation processes. In order {{to investigate the}} tidal {{evolution of}} globular clusters, a numerical scheme which utilizes a Fokker-Planck approach as well as direct numerical integration of the restricted three-body problem is developed. In the inner regions of the cluster, stellar orbits are mapped with the cluster's gravitational potential and orbit-averaged diffusion coefficients. In the outer regions, the Galactic tidal field is explicitly included in the direct orbital integration.

Overview Human Interaction Management, or HIM, ([3]), is a set of management principles, patterns and techniques complementary to Business Process Management, or BPM. HIM provides processbased support for innovative, adaptive, collaborative human work and allows it to be integrated in a structured way with more routine work processes that are often largely automated via BPM systems or other technologies. HIM has been described as: • "the next logical step in process-based technology"...|$|R
40|$|The {{blocking}} {{probability of a}} network is a common measure of its performance. There exist means of quickly calculating the blocking probabilities of Banyan networks; however, because Banyan networks have no redundant paths, they are not inherently fault-tolerant, and so their use in large-scale multiprocessors is problematic. Unfortunately, the addition of multiple paths between message sources and sinks in a network complicates the calculation of blocking probabilities. A methodology for exact calculation of blocking probabilities for small networks with redundant paths <b>is</b> presented <b>here,</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> discussion of its potential use in approximating blocking probabilities for large networks with redundant paths...|$|R

5000|$|Excavation in Sixtoe Field {{began in}} 1962. Excavation covered about 25 acres, with test pits {{yielding}} {{the existence of}} a workshop site (9MU100; XU-G). A ton or more of worked stone of various stages <b>was</b> discovered <b>here,</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> stones being subjected to heating or burning. The majority of the mineral content was quartz, with about 5 per cent showing various quartzitic combinations: slate, limestone, limited flint or chert. A few “rejects” were found, but almost no completed or nearly completed specimens. The artifacts indicate that main period of workshop activity took place during the Late Archaic period. The site is not a source site of quartz; rather the quartz came from the streambed of the Coosawattee River.|$|R
