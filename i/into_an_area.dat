5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 24. It developed <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of low pressure as it crossed the Atlantic, and organized into Tropical Depression Thirteen on August 28 while 960mi (1550km) east of the Lesser Antilles.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Paul was a {{hurricane}} that ultimately struck Mexico as a tropical depression in October 2006. It developed {{from an area}} of disturbed weather on October21, and slowly intensified as it moved <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of warm waters and progressively decreasing wind shear. Paul attained hurricane status on October23, and later that day it reached its peak intensity of 105mph (165km/h), a strong Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale. A strong trough turned the hurricane {{to the north and}} northeast <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of strong vertical shear, and Paul weakened to a tropical storm on October24. It accelerated northeastward, and after passing a short distance south of Baja California Sur the low level circulation became decoupled {{from the rest of the}} convection. Paul weakened to a tropical depression on October25 a short distance off the coast of Mexico, and after briefly turning away from the coast it made landfall on northwestern Sinaloa on October26.|$|E
5|$|Ships in {{the eastern}} Atlantic Ocean {{suggested}} that a tropical storm was present on October28 with peak winds of 50mph (85km/h). It was estimated to have originated the previous day. The small storm moved to the northwest and later west <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of sparse observations, suggesting a weaker system. The system's track ended on October29 due to uncertainty, but it was estimated to have dissipated soon after.|$|E

5|$|A low {{pressure}} area that developed in the Bay of Bengal passed over the southern Indian subcontinent and developed into a depression in the Arabian Sea off the southern Maharashtra coast on October 11. The depression did not develop as it drifted west, and it degenerated <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of {{low pressure}} as it was approaching the Arabian Peninsula. The depression brought widespread rains to southern Maharashtra and Karnataka states, with 40mm (1.5in) of rain recorded in Karwar. Scattered heavy rain was also reported in the Laccadives.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{entered the}} Atlantic Ocean from Africa on July 10, and the wave developed <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of low pressure while passing over Cape Verde. Despite the organization, the low failed {{to develop into}} a tropical cyclone due to cool waters on the sea surface and wind shear. However, those unfavorable conditions did not completely destroy the wave, as it continued traveling westward through the Lesser Antilles until July 18. That day, while south of Puerto Rico, the wave split in two; the northern half moved northwest and developed into Tropical Storm Franklin over the Bahamas, and the southern half continued westward, with its associated thunderstorm activity increasing.|$|E
5|$|Attached to US forces, 1 RAR was {{primarily}} employed in search and destroy operations using the newly developed doctrine of airmobile operations, utilising helicopters to insert light infantry and artillery <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of operations, {{and to support}} them with aerial mobility, fire support, casualty evacuation, and resupply. The battalion commenced operations in late June 1965 and initially focussed on defeating the Viet Cong's wet season offensive. During this time US 173rd Brigade, including 1 RAR, conducted a number of operations into War Zone D—a major communist base area at the junction of Phuoc Long, Long Khanh, Bien Hoa and Binh Duong provinces—as {{well as in the}} Iron Triangle in November.|$|E

5|$|Gol Transportes Aéreos Flight 1907 (ICAO: GLO 1907) was a Boeing 737-8EH, {{registration}} PR-GTD, on {{a scheduled}} domestic passenger flight from Manaus, Brazil, to Rio de Janeiro. On 29 September 2006, at 16:56 BRT, it collided in midair with an Embraer Legacy 600 business jet over the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso. All 154 {{passengers and crew}} aboard the Boeing 737 died when the aircraft broke up in midair and crashed <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of dense jungle, while the Embraer Legacy, despite sustaining serious damage to its left wing and tail, landed safely with its seven occupants uninjured.|$|E
5|$|Having {{failed to}} break through to Berlin, Wenck's XII Army made a {{fighting}} retreat back towards the Elbe and American lines after providing the IX Army survivors with surplus transport.

Meanwhile, the XII Army's bridgehead, with its headquarters in the park of Schönhausen, came under heavy Soviet artillery bombardment and was compressed <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> eight by two kilometres (five by one and a quarter miles).|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Barry {{originated}} from a tropical disturbance {{that left the}} Northwestern African coast on August 13. Most of the season, the northwestern tropical Atlantic Ocean had upper-level wind shear, which had inhibited development of systems. Due to these conditions, the disturbance was unable to strengthen until August 22 as it was approaching the Bahamas. A weak trough moved the disturbance <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of low wind shear, and the disturbance intensified into Tropical Depression Four {{on the evening of}} August 23. The depression was just to the northeast of the northern Bahamian Islands where it strengthened into Tropical Storm Barry on the morning of August 24.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Kate {{maintained}} hurricane {{status for}} twelve hours before decelerating {{to the north}} and weakening to a tropical storm. The storm then turned sharply west-southwestward while moving around the eastern side of a mid-level circulation. Passing over progressively warmer waters and <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> with decreasing vertical shear, Kate regained hurricane status on October 1. Guided by an anticyclone to its north and a cyclonic circulation to its south, the hurricane continued west-southwestward over the subtropical waters of 30°N, and presented a well-defined eye on October 2. On the next day it strengthened to attain major hurricane status, and on October 4 Hurricane Kate reached a peak intensity of 125mph (205km/h) while located 650mi (1,050km) east of Bermuda.|$|E

And we went <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> that Mariah didn't really go into-in her words, {{it was a little bit}} too schmaltzy or too ballady or too old-fashioned as far as melody and lyrics.|$|E
5|$|On August 25, a {{tropical}} wave emerged {{off the coast}} of Africa. Tracking westward, the wave developed convection over its center, and conducive conditions allowed it to develop further. The system passed through the Cape Verde islands later that day as convection steadily weakened. Early on August 27, convection again increased and consolidated near the center, and later that day the wave developed into Tropical Depression Ten while located 420miles (675km) west of the Cape Verde islands. Moving westward <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of warm waters and low vertical shear, the depression steadily intensified, and was named Tropical Storm Fabian on August 28 as convection increased and banding features became more prominent.|$|E

5|$|On June 26, a small {{burst of}} {{moisture}} in the system was noted {{in the area of}} the wave, but no other notable development occurred. On July 2, the wave moved over Central America and produced scattered areas of strong convection off the coast of Honduras. Later in the day, the center of the wave became elongated as determined by a QuikSCAT satellite pass. By the afternoon, the wave developed <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of low pressure and a tropical cyclone formation alert was issued as the possibility of a tropical cyclone developing within 48 hours was present.|$|E
5|$|Razer's next {{appearance}} {{came in a}} Robot Wars Christmas special {{called the}} Southern Annihilator. Six robots fought {{at the same time}} until one was eliminated, either through immobilisation or judges' decision. The remaining five robots then fought again, eliminating another, and so on until one robot remained and was declared the winner. Razer outlasted Vercingetorix, SpawnofScutter, Behemoth and AttilatheDrum to set up a final against Onslaught. An attack by Razer's arm on one of Onslaught's rear wheels saw its adversary shed a tyre, lose grip, and drive <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> patrolled by Matilda. The house robot flipped Onslaught onto its side, rendering it immobile. Assured of victory, Razer attacked and badly damaged Matilda's bodywork and rear shell.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Five-E was a {{tropical}} depression which made landfall along the south-western Mexican coastline in July 2008. It {{was the fifth}} tropical cyclone of the 2008 Pacific hurricane season. The depression developed out of a weak tropical wave which formed {{off the coast of}} Africa on June 23. The wave remained poorly organized throughout its journey through the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. The wave entered the Eastern Pacific on July 2 after passing through Central America. The wave developed <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of low pressure that afternoon.|$|E

5|$|While turning northeastward over {{northern}} Florida, Alma quickly weakened to {{a tropical}} storm. It moved across Georgia and emerged into the Atlantic near Savannah late on June10. Its circulation remained near the coast, although by late on June11, Alma had moved far enough offshore {{that it was}} able to re-intensify into a hurricane. It developed a large eye and maintained hurricane intensity for about 18hours. Afterward, Alma turned to the north <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> of drier air and colder waters, and again weakened to a tropical storm on June12. The next day, Alma transitioned into an extratropical cyclone to the east of Maryland. The remnants continued to the northeast and dissipated on June14 over Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|A revised design {{turned the}} {{mezzanine}} floor <b>into</b> <b>an</b> <b>area</b> {{that could be}} used as an arts venue, cinema, music auditorium or conference room for 120 to 150people. New plans cost £60,000. However this new design was deemed to be unworkable. A second design consisted of another six-storey building with a large ground-floor shop, a first-storey car park, and four floors of flats. This would have been half a metre less in height than the previous design, and did not include the tower. The plan was initially rejected by the council, but was subsequently approved in April 2008, before being rejected by the Planning Inspectorate. Several later applications for the site were also rejected, particularly due to concerns over parking, and the site was vacant as of June 2015.|$|E
