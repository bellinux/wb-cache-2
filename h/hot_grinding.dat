40|$|High Efficiency Deep Grinding (HEDG) {{combines}} high {{depths of}} cut, high grinding wheel speeds with high work piece feed rates {{to deliver a}} very high stock removal process that can produce components free of surface damage. High contact temperatures are a characteristic {{of the process and}} this produces a mass of <b>hot</b> <b>grinding</b> sparks being ejected from the grinding zone. Neat oil cutting fluids are typically used in HEDG due to their excellent lubricity, but the high grinding wheel speeds employed leads to high levels of highly volatile cutting fluid mist in the machine canopy. This mist can mix with the <b>hot</b> <b>grinding</b> sparks being ejected from the grinding zone to create a potential fire hazard. The project aim was to produce a cutting fluid application strategy for the HEDG regime, focusing on establishing the thermal characteristics of cutting fluids {{in order to determine the}} optimum cutting fluid for the HEDG process. The cutting fluid application strategy also involved investigating the optimum means by which to apply the cutting fluid, based on minimising amount of cutting fluid used in the process and in reducing the potential fire hazard. The characteristics that have a thermal impact on the grinding process are the cooling, lubrication, ignition and misting properties of the fluid. A series of tests were established to investigate these properties and therefore allow different fluids to be compared and contrasted for their suitability for the HEDG regime based. Once an optimal cutting fluid had been established, the project then investigated the optimal method of applying this fluid, with particular reference to the type and design of the nozzle used to apply the fluid to the grinding zone. As part of these trials, a series of benchmark tests were also conducted using long established cutting fluid application techniques to enable the benefits of the new strategy to be evaluated. The project concluded that high viscosity neat oil ester based cutting fluids were the best fluids to be used in the HEDG regime due to they excellent lubricity and low misting properties coupled to their relatively high resistance to ignition when compared to neat mineral oils. The studies also found that using a high viscosity ester based fluid and then applying it using a coherent jet nozzle, significant reductions in the grinding powder and specific grinding energy could be achieved whilst significantly lowering the amount of mist in the machine, thus reducing the potential fire hazard and the volume of cutting fluid used by the process...|$|E
40|$|A {{computer-controlled}} apparatus processes {{batches of}} soybeans into {{one or more}} of a variety of food products, under conditions that can be chosen by the user and reproduced from batch to batch. Examples of products include soy milk, tofu, okara (an insoluble protein and fiber byproduct of soy milk), and whey. Most processing steps take place without intervention by the user. This apparatus was developed for use in research on processing of soy. It is also a prototype of other soy-processing apparatuses for research, industrial, and home use. Prior soy-processing equipment includes household devices that automatically produce soy milk but do not automatically produce tofu. The designs of prior soy-processing equipment require users to manually transfer intermediate solid soy products and to press them manually and, hence, under conditions that are not consistent from batch to batch. Prior designs do not afford choices of processing conditions: Users cannot use previously developed soy-processing equipment to investigate the effects of variations of techniques used to produce soy milk (e. g., cold grinding, <b>hot</b> <b>grinding,</b> and pre-cook blanching) and of such process parameters as cooking times and temperatures, grinding times, soaking times and temperatures, rinsing conditions, and sizes of particles generated by grinding. In contrast, the present apparatus is amenable to such investigations. The apparatus (see figure) includes a processing tank and a jacketed holding or coagulation tank. The processing tank can be capped by either of two different heads and can contain either of two different insertable mesh baskets. The first head includes a grinding blade and heating elements. The second head includes an automated press piston. One mesh basket, designated the okara basket, has oblong holes with a size equivalent to about 40 mesh [40 openings per inch (. 16 openings per centimeter) ]. The second mesh basket, designated the tofu basket, has holes of 70 mesh [70 openings per inch (. 28 openings per centimeter) ] and is used in conjunction with the press-piston head. Supporting equipment includes a soy-milk heat exchanger for maintaining selected coagulation temperatures, a filter system for separating okara from other particulate matter and from soy milk, two pumps, and various thermocouples, flowmeters, level indicators, pressure sensors, valves, tubes, and sample port...|$|E
50|$|Tofu {{flavor is}} {{generally}} described as bland, however this taste is desired by customers in North America while a more beany-flavor is preferred in East Asia. The beany or bland taste is generated during the grinding and cooking unit process during production and either a “hot grind” or “cold grind” {{can be implemented}} to influence the taste in line with taste preference. The <b>hot</b> <b>grind</b> method reduces the beany flavor due to the inactivation of the lipoxygenase enzyme in soy protein that is known to generate off flavors to generate a tofu that is “bland” taste whereas the cold grind the enzyme is still present which produces the aldehyde, alcohol and ester volatile compounds that create to the beany notes of some tofu.|$|R
60|$|In {{due time}} Neale and Larry arrived at North Platte, which {{was little more}} than a camp. The {{construction}} gangs were not expected to reach there until late in the fall. Baxter was at North Platte, with a lame surveyor, and no other helpers; consequently he hailed Neale and Larry with open arms. A summer's work on the hot monotonous plains stared Neale in the face, but he must resign himself to the inevitable. He worked, as always, with that ability and energy which had made him invaluable to his superiors. Here, however, the labor was a dull, <b>hot</b> <b>grind,</b> without any thrills. Neale filled the long days with duty and seldom let his mind-wander. In leisure hours, however, he dreamed of Allie and the future. He found no trouble in passing time that way. Also he watched eagerly for arrivals from the west, whom he questioned about Indians in the Wyoming hills; and from troops or travelers coming from the east he heard all the news of the advancing railroad construction. It was absorbingly interesting, yet Neale could credit so few of the tales.|$|R
40|$|The {{antidiabetic}} {{activities of}} bitter melon powders produced with lyophilization/superfine <b>grinding</b> and <b>hot</b> air drying/normal <b>grinding</b> were investigated in vivo for selecting a suitable bitter melon processing procedure. After a five-week treatment, bitter melon lyophilized superfine grinding powder (BLSP) {{had a higher}} antidiabetic activity with reducing fasting blood glucose levels from 21. 40 to 12. 54 mmol/L, the serum insulin levels from 40. 93 to 30. 74 mIU/L, and restoring activities of SOD compared {{with those in the}} bitter melon hot air drying powder (BAP) treated group. Furthermore, BLSP protected pancreatic tissues including islet beta cells and reduced the loss of islet cells. Combined with the difference of compositions in BLSP and BAP, it could be concluded that superfine grinding and lyophilization processes were beneficial for presenting the antidiabetic activity, which will provide a reference for direct utilization of bitter melon as a suitable functional food to relieve symptoms of diabetes...|$|R
40|$|Exposure to {{airborne}} {{crystalline silica}} and other atmospheric contaminants in foundries {{is a well}} recognised hazard. However, the ultrafine dust component in foundry environments has been poorly characterised and there is increasing concern regarding cardio-respiratory disease risks. At present, no generic exposure criteria exist for ultrafine particles which may arise from <b>hot</b> processes, <b>grinding</b> and combustion. Fine and ultrafine airborne particle concentrations in a large ferrous foundry were measured {{over a period of}} four days using a contour mapping approach, as well as some personal sampling. Number and gravimetric concentrations in various regions were assessed with direct reading instrumentation on a trolley (P-Trak, DustTrak and HandiLaz multichannel particle counter). There was considerable variability in daily results probably reflecting process conditions and sources (such as core shop, furnace area pouring line, barrel line and fettling shop). The highest five-minuted average ultrafine concentration was recorded in the core shop (GM = 2. 11 × 105 pt/cc), with lower values recorded in the pouring line, shakeout and fettling areas. Similar trends were seen for PM 2. 5 with highest values again in the core shop (GM = 0. 3 mg/m 3). The highest respirable quartz concentration was found in the shakeout area (0. 1 mg/m 3). In general, airborne dust was well controlled by enclosure and LEV. These results are generally consistent with the literature and suggest that contour mapping for ultrafine particles is an appropriate strategy for more specific evaluation of sources and dust control systems.

50|$|Typically, {{the ends}} of the rails are cleaned, aligned flat and true, and spaced apart 25 mm. This gap between rail ends for welding is to ensure {{consistent}} results in the pouring of the molten steel into the weld mold. In the event of a welding failure, the rail ends can be cropped to a 75 mm gap, removing the melted and damaged rail ends, and a new weld attempted with a special mould and larger thermite charge. A two or three piece hardened sand mould is clamped around the rail ends, and a torch of suitable heat capacity is used to preheat {{the ends of}} the rail and the interior of the mould. The proper amount of thermite with alloying metal is placed in a refractory crucible, and when the rails have reached a sufficient temperature, the thermite is ignited and allowed to react to completion (allowing time for any alloying metal to fully melt and mix, yielding the desired molten steel or alloy). The reaction crucible is then tapped at the bottom. Modern crucibles have a self-tapping thimble in the pouring nozzle. The molten steel flows into the mould, fusing with the rail ends and forming the weld. The slag, being lighter than the steel flows last from the crucible and overflows the mould into a steel catch basin, to be disposed of after cooling. The entire setup is allowed to cool. The mould is removed and the weld is cleaned by <b>hot</b> chiselling and <b>grinding</b> to produce a smooth joint. Typical time from start of the work until a train can run over the rail is approximately 45 minutes to more than an hour, depending on the rail size and ambient temperature. In any case, the rail steel must be cooled to less than 370 C before it can sustain the weight of rail locomotives.|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryJim NelssenSix {{experiments}} using 3, 659 nursery {{and finishing}} pigs {{were conducted to}} evaluate the effects of dietary soybean hulls and ingredient processing in corn-soybean meal or corn-soybean meal-DDGS diets on nursery and finishing performance. Experiment 1 tested increasing soybean hulls (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 %) and increasing soybean hulls decreased ADG and G:F. Experiment 2 evaluated increasing soybean hulls (0, 10, and 20 %) in diets balanced or not for NE and showed reduced performance with increasing soybean hulls. Balancing for NE resulted in G:F similar to pigs fed the control. Experiments 3 and 4 evaluated increasing dietary soybean hulls in corn-soybean meal and corn-soybean meal-DDGS diets. Soybean hulls in either diet worsened G:F and improved caloric efficiency, suggesting current INRA (2004) values for soybean hulls underestimate their energy value. Experiment 5 evaluated 10 and 20 % ground or unground soybean hulls in meal and pelleted diets. Caloric efficiency improved {{with high levels of}} soybean hulls. Pelleting improved ADG and eliminated negative effects on G:F with increasing soybean hulls, while grinding soybean hulls reduced performance. Experiment 6 tested increasing ground and unground soybean hulls (0, 7. 5, and 15 %). Increasing soybean hulls worsened G:F, carcass yield, and <b>hot</b> carcass weight. <b>Grinding</b> soybean hulls to finer particle sizes did not improve ADG and worsened G:F. Experiments 7 and 8 evaluated the replacement of corn with wheat and crystalline amino acids in nursery and finishing pig diets. Replacing 50 % of corn with wheat did not affect growth performance in either nursery or finishing; however 100 % replacement of corn with wheat reduced performance. In addition, feeding wheat improved carcass fat IV, while use of high levels of crystalline amino acids in wheat-based diets did not influence performance in either study. Experiment 9 evaluated the replacement of soybean meal with high-protein dried distiller’s grains with solubles and crystalline amino acids. High-protein DDGS and crystalline AA can replace 50 % of the SBM in finishing diets without negatively affecting performance or carcass yield. Replacing 100 % of SBM with high-protein DDGS reduced growth rate, but increasing crystalline AA levels can help mitigate negative effects on carcass yield and fat IV...|$|R
