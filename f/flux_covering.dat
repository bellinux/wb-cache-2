At first, the application {{share of the}} inverter voltage vectors for the stator <b>flux</b> <b>covering</b> half a sextant is defined and predicted. The prediction indicates that, under operation at fixed inverter dc link voltage and stator flux magnitude, the application share depends only on the supply frequency of the motor and, to a small extent, on the load. Afterwards, the inverter transitions and the corresponding phase commutations within a stator flux sextant are analyzed. The outcome of the analysis permits to compute the commutations of the inverter phases in one turn of the stator flux and, from them, the inverter switching frequency is obtained.

A simple analytical model of the particle-drop collision was developed to describe the particle recovery by the drops {{as a function of}} the water <b>flux,</b> <b>covering</b> two extremes of relative velocity between the particles and drops. The Discrete Element Method was used to validate the analytical model. Further validation of the model and insights were obtained through experimental studies.

Hydrophilic particles were readily engulfed while hydrophobic particles, at best, adhered to the surface of the drop, or failed to attach. Moreover, the recovery of the hydrophilic silica particles was significantly higher than the recovery of hydrophobic coal particles, with the selectivity ratio approximately 1. 5. Spherical ballotini particles were the most sensitive, with a notable increase in recovery when cleaned, and evidence of increased recovery with increasing particle size. The recovery of irregular shaped silica flour particles, however, was largely independent of the particle size.

40|$|Globally, lakes are {{frequently}} supersaturated with carbon dioxide (CO 2) and are major emitters of carbon to the atmosphere. Recent studies have generated {{awareness of the}} high variability in pCO(2 aq) (the partial pressure corresponding to the concentration in water) and CO 2 fluxes to the atmosphere {{and the need for}} better accounting for this variability. However, studies simultaneously accounting for both spatial and temporal variability of pCO(2 aq) and CO 2 fluxes in lakes are rare. We measured pCO(2 aq) (by both manual sampling and mini loggers) and CO 2 <b>fluxes,</b> <b>covering</b> spatial variability in open water areas of three lakes of different character in a Swedish catchment for 2 years. Spatial pCO(2 aq) variability within lakes was linked to distance from shore, proximity to stream inlets, and deepwater upwelling events. Temporally, pCO(2 aq) variability was linked with variability in dissolved organic carbon, total nitrogen, and dissolved oxygen. While previous studies over short time periods (1 to 6 h) observed gas transfer velocity (k) to be more variable than pCO(2 aq), our work shows that over longer time (days to weeks) pCO(2 aq) variability was greater and affected CO 2 fluxes much more than k. We demonstrate that 8 measurement days distributed over multiple seasons in combination with sufficient spatial coverage (8 locations during stratification periods and 5 or less in spring and autumn) are a key for representative yearly whole lake flux estimates.

For this purpose, a valve controlled disjunct eddy covariance system was mounted at 65 m a. g. l. on a military radio tower. The concentration values for 11 size bins with aerodynamic diameters (D 50) from 0. 03 to 10 ?m were measured with an electrical low pressure impactor. After comparison with other fluxes obtained from 10 Hz measurements with the classical eddy covariance method, the loss of information concerning high frequent parts of the flux could be stated as negligible. The results offer an extended insight in the turbulent atmospheric exchange of aerosol particles by highly size-resolved particle <b>fluxes</b> <b>covering</b> 11 size bins and show that the city of MÃ¼nster acts as a relevant source for aerosol particles. Significant differences occur between the fluxes of the various particle size classes. While the total particle number flux shows a pattern which is strictly correlated to the diurnal course of the turbulence regime and the traffic intensity, the total mass flux exhibits a single minimum in the evening hours when coarse particles start to deposit.

40|$|Humans {{have greatly}} {{impacted}} the processes and intensities of erosion, sediment {{transport and storage}} since the introduction of agriculture. However, {{the relation between the}} intensity of anthropogenic disturbance and the magnitude of change in sediment dynamics is highly non-linear due to the importance of intrinsic controls on sediment propagation. Especially the buffering capacity of slopes and floodplains can be held responsible for this non-linearity, as both sinks store the produced sediment temporarily, obscuring the relation between sediment production and sediment output. Slope-stream connectivity, but also the duration and typology of anthropogenic disturbance controls the existence of thresholds that need to be crossed before significant changes in downstream sediment dynamics are recorded following human impact. Many internal feedback mechanisms, such as those between erosion and soil thickness, further complicate the story. Several concepts have been developed over the last few decades to explain the complex behavior of sediment transfers in the combined hillslope-fluvial system, including the 'sediment cascade' model and the 'fast-in, slow-out' model. However, none of these concepts seems to hold universally when reconstructing historical sediment dynamics for contrasting environments, as is illustrated with case-studies from a range of environments in Belgium, Turkey and the USA. Detailed field-based sediment budgets from these contrasting settings combined with spatial modeling of sediment <b>fluxes</b> <b>covering</b> time periods ranging from 200 to over 5000 years, as well as the use of pollen and sediment provenancing techniques, shows that no overarching concept of sediment source-to-sink following anthropogenic disturbance can be established. Rather, depending on the duration and typology of anthropogenic disturbances, in combination with local environmental conditions, unique patterns of geomorphic process response emerge. As a result, unravelling the human impact from current-day sediment archives and predicting the impact of future human disturbances on river and sediment behavior remains a major challenge. This has important implications for interpreting contemporary sediment yields as well as downstream sediment records in large floodplains, delta's and the marine environment, in terms of changes in the drivers of environmental change. status: publishe...|$|R

We sought to test whether the quiet Sun flux detected by Hinode is due to a local or the global dynamo by studying long-term variations in the polarisation signals detectable at the disc centre of the quiet Sun between November 2006 and May 2012, with particular emphasis on weak signals in the internetwork. Methods. The investigation focusses on line-integrated circular polarisation Vtot and linear polarisation LPtot profiles obtained from the Fe I 6302. 5 Ã absorption line in Hinode SOT/SP. Results. Both circular and linear polarisation signals show no overall variation in the fraction of selected pixels from 2006 until 2012. There is also no variation in the magnetic flux in this interval of time. The probability density functions (PDF) of the line-of-sight magnetic flux can be fitted with a power law from 1. 17 Ã 1017 Mx to 8. 53 Ã 1018 Mx with index Î± = â 1. 82 Â± 0. 02 in 2007.

Indeed, dust supply to the Southern Ocean increases during ice ages, and 'iron fertilization' of the subantarctic zone may have contributed up to 40 parts per million by volume (p. p. m. v.) of the decrease (80 - 100 p. p. m. v.) in atmospheric carbon dioxide observed during late Pleistocene glacial cycles (Watson et al., 2000, doi: 10. 1038 / 35037561; Kohfeld et al., 2005, doi: 10. 1126 /science. 1105375; MartÃ­nez-Garcia et al., 2009, doi: 10. 1029 / 2008 PA 001657; Sigman et al., 2010, doi: 10. 1038 /nature 09149; Hain et al., 2010, doi: 10. 1029 / 2010 gb 003790). So far, however, the magnitude of Southern Ocean dust deposition in earlier times and its role in the development and evolution of Pleistocene glacial cycles have remained unclear. Here we report a high-resolution record of dust and iron supply to the Southern Ocean over the past four million years, derived from the analysis of marine sediments from ODP Site 1090, located in the Atlantic sector of the subantarctic zone. The close correspondence of our dust and iron deposition records with Antarctic ice core reconstructions of dust <b>flux</b> <b>covering</b> the past 800, 000 years (Lambert et al., 2008, doi: 10. 1038 /nature 06763; Wolf et al., 2006, doi: 10. 1038 /nature 04614) indicates that both of these archives record large-scale deposition changes that should apply to most of the Southern Ocean, validating previous interpretations of the ice core data. The extension of the record beyond the interval covered by the Antarctic ice cores reveals that, in contrast to the relatively gradual intensification of glacial cycles over the past three million years, Southern Ocean dust and iron flux rose sharply at the Mid-Pleistocene climatic transition around 1. 25 million years ago. This finding complements previous observations over late Pleistocene glacial cycles (MartÃ­nez-Garcia et al., 2009; Lambert et al., 2008; Wolff et al., 2006), providing new evidence of a tight connection between high dust input to the Southern Ocean and the emergence of the deep glaciations that characterize the past one million years of Earth history...|$|E

This study addresses the model results of Phytotoxic Ozone Dose metric (POD) based on estimation of stomatal O 3 flux to dwarf mountain pine (Pinus mugo) and Swiss stone pine (Pinus cembra). We focused on two different bioclimatic regions: (1) the temperate mountain forests in the High Tatra Mts (SKâHT) of the Western Carpathians, and (2) the Mediterranean forests of the AlpesâMercantour (FRâAlp) in the AlpesâMaritimes. Field measurement of O 3 concentration and meteorological data incorporated into deposition model DO 3 SE showed lower O 3 flux in FRâAlp than in SKâHT plots for the 2016 growing season. Model outputs showed that soil humidity {{play a key role}} in stomatal O 3 uptake by montane pines at the alpine timberline. We found that temperate climatic conditions in SKâHT with sufficient precipitation did not limit stomatal conductivity and O 3 uptake of P. mugo and P. cembra. On the other hand, the Mediterranean mountain climate characterised by warm and dry summer reduced stomatal conductance of pines in FRâAlp. POD without threshold limitation i. e. POD 0 as a recently developed biologically sounded O 3 metric varied near around and below critical level (CLef) depending upon different conditions of sunshine exposure in SKâHT plots. Field observation at these plots showed relatively weak visible O 3 injury on P. cembra (2 â% and 7 â%) when compared with P. mugo (8 â% and 18 â%) for one year (C+ 1) and two year (C+ 2) old needles, respectively. Despite of low POD 0 values, clearly below CLef, the highest level of visible O 3 damage on average from 10 â% (C+ 1) to 25 â% (C+ 2) was observed on P. cembra needles in Mediterranean (FRâAlp) area. Further research is needed to clarify the effect of real soil moisture regime on stomatal closure in dry areas (FRâAlp) and resistance of pine species against visible O 3 injury in wet subalpine zones (SKâHT). More attention should be paid to O 3 <b>fluxes</b> <b>covering</b> a year-round growing season as well as intra-daily dynamics, especially the night hours, since these time spans appear to play significant role in O 3 uptake by mountain conifers...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a relatively simple}} method for recovering global fields of latent heat flux. The method focuses on specifying Bowen ratio estimates through exploiting air temperature and vapour pressure measurements obtained from infrared soundings of the AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder) sensor onboard NASA's Aqua platform. Through combining these Bowen ratio retrievals with satellite surface net available energy data, we have specified estimates of global noontime surface latent heat flux at the 1 Â°Ã 1 Â° scale. These estimates were provisionally evaluated against data from 30 terrestrial tower <b>flux</b> sites <b>covering</b> {{a broad spectrum of}} biomes. Taking monthly average 13 : 30 data for 2003, this revealed promising agreement between the satellite and tower measurements of latent heat flux, with a pooled root-mean-square deviation of 79 W m â 2, and no significant bias. However, this success partly arose as a product of the underspecification of the AIRS Bowen ratio compensating for the underspecification of the AIRS net available energy, suggesting further refinement of the approach is required. The error analysis suggested that the landscape level variability in enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and land surface temperature contributed significantly to the statistical metric of the predicted latent heat fluxes...|$|R

40|$|Although {{there has}} yet been no undisputed {{discovery}} of a still-forming planet embedded in a gaseous protoplanetary disk, the cleared inner holes of transitional disks may be signposts of young planets. Here we show that the subset of accreting transitional disks with wide, optically thin inner holes of 15 AU or more can only be sculpted by multiple planets orbiting inside each hole. Multiplanet systems provide two key ingredients for explaining the origins of transitional disks. First, multiple planets can clear wide inner holes where single planets open only narrow gaps. Second, the confined, non-axisymmetric accretion flows produced by multiple planets provide a way for an arbitrary amount of mass transfer to occur through an apparently optically thin hole without over-producing infrared excess flux. Rather than assuming the gas and dust in the hole are evenly and axisymmetrically distributed, one can construct an inner hole with apparently optically thin infrared <b>fluxes</b> by <b>covering</b> a macroscopic fraction of the hole's surface area with locally optically thick tidal tails. We also establish that other clearing mechanisms, such as photoevaporation, cannot explain our subset of accreting transitional disks with wide holes. Transitional disks are therefore high-value targets for observational searches for young planetary systems.

40|$|Competing {{models for}} broad {{spectral}} {{features in the}} soft X-ray spectrum of the Seyfert I galaxy Mrk 766 are tested against data from a 130 ks XMM-Newton observation. A model including relativistically broadened Ly-alpha emission lines of OVIII, NVII and CVI is a better fit to 0. 3 - 2 keV XMM RGS data than a dusty warm absorber. Moreover, the measured depth of neutral iron absorption lines in the spectrum is inconsistent with {{the magnitude of the}} iron edge required to produce the continuum break at 17 - 18 Angstroms in the dusty warm absorber model. The relativistic emission line model can reproduce the broad-band (0. 1 - 12 keV) XMM-EPIC data {{with the addition of a}} fourth line to represent emission from ionized iron at 6. 7 keV and an excess due to reflection at energies above the iron line. The profile of the 6. 7 keV iron line is consistent with that measured for the low energy lines. There is evidence in the RGS data at the 3 sigma level for spectral features that vary with source <b>flux.</b> The <b>covering</b> fraction of warm absorber gas is estimated to be ~ 12 %. Iron in the warm absorber is found to be overabundant with respect to CNO compared to solar values. Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ Letter...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new version of the MURaM {{radiative}} MHD code that allows for simulations spanning from the upper convection zone into the solar corona. We implemented the relevant coronal physics in terms of optically thin radiative loss, field aligned heat conduction and an equilibrium ionization equation of state. We artificially limit the coronal AlfvÃ©n and heat conduction speeds to computationally manageable values using an approximation to semi-relativistic MHD with an artificially reduced speed of light (Boris correction). We present example solutions ranging from quiet to active Sun in order to verify the validity of our approach. We quantify the role of numerical diffusivity for the effective coronal heating. We find that the (numerical) magnetic Prandtl number determines the ratio of resistive to viscous heating and that owing to the very large magnetic Prandtl number of the solar corona, heating is expected to happen predominantly through viscous dissipation. We find that reasonable solutions can be obtained with values of the reduced speed of light just marginally larger than the maximum sound speed. Overall this leads to a fully explicit code that can compute the time evolution of the solar corona in response to photospheric driving using numerical time steps not much smaller than 0. 1 seconds. Numerical simulations of the coronal response to <b>flux</b> emergence <b>covering</b> a time span of a few days are well within reach using this approach.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{uncertainty}} in net ecosystem exchange {{due to the}} model treatment of heterotrophic respiration {{in a variety of}} hydroclimatic conditions using a land surface model. Multiple soil temperature-respiration functions and soil moisture-respiration functions are incorporated into the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach with Carbon- Nitrogen-Phosphorus (CASA-CNP) biogeochemical model coupled to the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange land surface model. Every possible combination of the newly implemented functions is then used to simulate heterotrophic respiration and net ecosystem exchange at 10 different <b>flux</b> towers <b>covering</b> a large range of global vegetation types. Results show that a large uncertainty in the simulated net ecosystem exchange is attributable to differences in the soil respiration parameterization. No single combination of soil temperature and moisture-respiration functions appears to show superior performance across all sites. Large variations in the simulated evolution of soil carbon storages emphasize the problem that to use an observationally based soil temperature or soil moisture response function requires a land surface model to capture the observed soil temperature and soil moisture mean and variability correctly. Land surface models are known to vary dramatically in their simulation of the soil moisture state and probably in their simulation of soil temperature. Resolving how to simulate heterotrophic respiration and net ecosystem exchange will therefore require an accurate simulation of temperature and moisture combined with a realistic soil heterotrophic respiration parameterization, and these cannot be developed and implemented in isolation...|$|R
40|$|San Cristbal volcano is {{the highest}} {{and one of the}} most active volcanoes in Nicaragua. Its {{persistently}} high activity during the past decade is characterized by strong degassing and almost annual VEI 1 - 2 explosions, which present a threat to the local communities. Following an eruption on 8 September 2012, the intervals between eruptions decreased significantly, which we interpret as the start of a new eruptive phase. We present here the results of semi-continuous SO 2 <b>flux</b> measurements <b>covering</b> a period of 18 months, obtained by two scanning UV-DOAS instruments installed as a part of the network for observation of volcanic and atmospheric change project, and the results of real-time seismic amplitude measurements (RSAM) data. Our data comprise a series of small to moderately explosive events in December 2012, June 2013 and February 2014, which were accompanied by increased gas emissions and seismicity. In order to approach an early warning strategy, we present a statistical method for the joint analysis of gas flux and seismic data, by using continuous wavelet transform and cross-wavelet transform (XWT) methods. This analysis shows that the XWT coefficients of SO 2 flux and RSAM are in good agreement with the occurrence of eruptive events and thus may be used to indicate magma ascent into the volcano edifice. Such multi-parameter surveillance efforts can be useful for the interpretation and surveillance of possible eruptive events and could thus be used by local institutions for the prediction of upcoming volcanic unrest...|$|R
