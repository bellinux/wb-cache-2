500|$|Solutions to the Fourier {{equation}} can {{be provided}} by Fourier series. Ingersoll and Zobel state {{that in many cases}} the calculation involved makes the solution [...] "well-nigh impossible" [...] by analytical means. [...] With modern technology such a calculation is trivially easy, but Ingersoll and Zobel recommend the use of <b>harmonic</b> <b>analysers,</b> which are the mechanical counterpart of today's spectrum analysers. [...] These machines add together mechanical oscillations of various frequencies, phases and amplitudes by combining them through a set of pulleys or springs; one for each oscillator. [...] The reverse process is also possible, driving the machine with the function and measuring the Fourier components as output.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to develop an accurate method for the analysis of signals composed of fluctuating harmonics. The results obtained of analysis are applied to the calibration of harmonic analysis instruments. A new method is presented suitable for the accurate analysis of smoothly fluctuating harmonic signals. The method is based on a model of signals with a known period, in which the harmonics are individually modulated by polynomial functions normalised over a sampled signal sequence time. Using this model, a decomposition method is developed such that the modulating polynomials can be recovered from a signal. The polynomial decomposition method leads to a piece-wise analysis of the waveform. Two methods based on least squares and splines respectively, are developed with the aim of giving continuity to the piece-wise analysis. Comparisons of the new method with the short time Fourier transform are given. Having defined a test signal and obtained and accurate analysis of it properties, {{it can be used to}} calibrate <b>harmonic</b> <b>analysers.</b> For a given applied signal, analysis with these devices can give rise to variation in results as a function of the phase between the signal and the STFT windows. This result distribution due to variable phase (RDVP) is discussed and examples are given for various signals. The RDVP complicates the calibration process due to the spread of results that occur when testing the device. A method is developed to find the RDVP for an applied signal that uses the polynomial decomposition method to find the modulation functions of each harmonic in the applied calibration signal. Having found the RDVP for an applied signal, it is necessary to fit the results of the analyser under test, to the distribution. The random nature of the phase makes the systematic comparison of the theoretical and measured distributions difficult to achieve. A novel method that uses multiple phase shifted modulated harmonics is presented. By comparing the results of the analyser under test to the distributions of each of the phase-shifted harmonics, a best-fit phase shift can be determined and the required calibration comparison made.

50|$|The {{basic concept}} of the ball-and-disk {{integrator}} was first described by James Thomson, brother of William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin. William used the concept to build the <b>Harmonic</b> <b>Analyser</b> in 1886. This system was {{used to calculate the}} coefficients of a Fourier series representing inputs dialled in as the positions of the balls. The inputs were set to measured tide heights from any port being studied. The output was then fed into a similar machine, the Harmonic Synthesiser, which spun several wheels to represent the phase of the contribution from the sun and moon. A wire running {{along the top of the}} wheels took the maximum value, which represented the tide in the port at a given time. Thomson mentioned the possibility of using the same system as a way to solve differential equations, but realized that the output torque from the integrator was too low to drive the required downstream systems of pointers.|$|E

These nonlinear loads, power electronics based ASDs, UPSs are used in industries in large numbers for smooth operation and control.

40|$|Abstract Traditional {{methods to}} measure power system {{harmonics}} employ either a power <b>harmonic</b> <b>analyser</b> or a software package such as Matlab. However, these usually have limited capability when used with an Internet connection and/or graphical interface. In this paper, a PC-based virtual instrument (VI) that can carry out remote measurement and monitoring using LabVIEW and a microprocessor (Intel 8051) for power system harmonics is proposed. The history of {{total harmonic distortion}} (THD) in the waveform signal can be also recorded and tracked in the database.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2009. The {{purpose of}} {{emulsification}} {{process is to}} create numerous small droplets from a large and homogenous oil phase. The emulsion {{used for this study}} is new thermodynamically unstable multi-component water-in-oil (w/o) explosive type with an internal phase ratio of approximately 94 % (wt), i. e. far beyond the close packing limit of spherical droplets of 74 %. However, little work has been done for this system, pertaining to the literature explaining what physical phenomena {{plays a major role in}} the process of drop formation during highly concentrated emulsion (HGE) manufacturing. This thesis is devoted to develop an understanding of what parameters control drop formation and rupture during processing of highly concentrated emulsions. The material used for the study consisted of three Pibsa derivatives (MEA, IMIDE and UREA), one mixture (MEA/SMO, 10 : 1) and SMO. Two concentrations were used namely 8 % and 14 % and the two fuel phase material were Mosspar-H and Shell sol. The Pibsa IMIDE was carried out in both oil phases.

40|$|The task of {{simultaneous}} {{power systems}} measurements at locations {{which can be}} hundreds of kilometres apart carries the problem of precise synchronisation. To introduce this topic, this thesis begins with an overview of time, time stamping and synchronised data acquisition, and reviews its application to power quality monitoring. It then discusses the requirements for such systems and how different application scenarios shift the emphasis between aspects of the requirements. The complexity of a power distribution monitoring system is most dependent {{on the number of}} channels and sites which must be analysed, and the required time stamping accuracy. For some applications, samples need to be time stamped with an accuracy of 1 µs. A requirements specification template is presented which aids, for example, in purchase decisions to establish needed features. A specific example of such a system, CHART III, has been developed at the University of Canterbury (Christchurch, New Zealand), which uses a hardware time base and sample dock generation, hardware time stamping, and GPS synchronisation to achieve a time stamping accuracy of 0. 5 µs. The design of the time base of this system is published in this thesis and described in detail. The CHART III system was used to gain practical experience and to establish its usability and operational limitations, and provided input for the theoretical considerations of an ideal system. Synchronised distributed data acquisition using two and three CHART III instrument was performed on two live power systems, collecting data in the frequency and time domains. A number of enhancements were made as a result, particularly to the control and analysis software in the areas of extending the handling of the GPS receiver and provision of additional system status and error information. Because the emphasis of the work is on the instrumentaton, no further analysis of the collected data is presented in this thesis. The CHART III system was connected to the internet to investigate issues of remote configuration and the consolidation of sample analysis at a single powerful computer. Limits for time domain measurements, which have a higher data rate than the system can handle continuously, were established as being a minimum of 10 seconds. In a data acquisition system, the quantisation error introduced by the ADC sets a lower limit for the noise. The effects of this quantisation noise on the recovery of harmonic magnitudes and phases were examined. Simulations were performed to model the influence of ADC width, fast Fourier transform length, harmonic amplitude and harmonic order. Both magnitude and phase errors are independent of harmonic order, decrease with the number of ADC quantisation levels, and decrease with the square root of the transform length. The magnitude error is independent of the harmonic amplitude for a sufficiently large amplitude to noise ratio. The phase error is inversely proportional to the amplitude. The accuracy of a <b>harmonic</b> <b>analyser</b> can therefore be increased by increasing the ADC width or the transform length. For accuracies likely to be required by typical power quality applications, these simulations indicate that a 12 bit ADC gives sufficiently accurate results. Finally, the effect of current trends in microprocessor technology is discussed. Power quality monitoring systems can now be built much more simply and cheaply then when CHART III was designed. The most important improvement is that a single standard CPU can now handle the data from a number of channels, eliminating the need for specialised digital signal processors and the associated cost of producing software for a second architecture. Processor performance seems to be set to increase steadily, promising future improvements in time stamping accuracy, the number of channels which can be handled by one processor, and the availability of more complex analysis functions...|$|E
