40|$|Thesis (M. Eng.) [...] Memorial University of Newfoundland, 2009. Engineering and Applied ScienceIncludes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 51 - 55) 316 L {{stainless steels}} {{are widely used}} throughout industry in potable water systems for their corrosion resistance. Welding of this material introduces a number of variables that can reduce the corrosion resistance and make the material subject to pitting corrosion. One such variable is the <b>heat</b> <b>tint</b> oxide that is produced during the welding process. This chromium rich layer {{is considered to be}} incoherent exposing the chromium depleted, and hence less resistant material to potentially corrosive environment. Literature suggests the pitting resistance of tinted material decreases with an increase in <b>heat</b> <b>tint</b> oxidation. The aim {{of this study was to}} test this correlation by producing welded samples with different degrees of <b>heat</b> <b>tint</b> and subject them to ASTM G 48 Method A for pitting and crevice corrosion resistance.

40|$|Duplex {{stainless}} steels {{are a very}} attractive alternative to austenitic grades due to their higher strength and good corrosion performance. The austenitic grades can often be welded autogenously, while the duplex grades normally require addition of filler metal. This is to counteract segregation of important alloying elements and to give sufficient austenite formation to prevent precipitation of chromium nitrides that could {{have a negative effect}} on impact toughness and pitting resistance. The corrosion performance of the recently-developed lean duplex stainless steel LDX 2101 is higher than that of 304 and can reach the level of 316. This thesis summarises pitting resistance tests performed on laser and gas tungsten arc (GTA) welded LDX 2101. It is shown here that this material can be autogenously welded, but additions of filler metal, nitrogen in the shielding gas and use of hybrid methods increases the austenite formation and the pitting resistance by further suppressing formation of chromium nitride precipitates in the weld metal. If the weld metal austenite formation is sufficient, the chromium nitride precipitates in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) could cause local pitting, however, this was not seen in this work. Instead, pitting occurred 1 – 3 mm from the fusion line, in the parent metal rather than in the high temperature HAZ (HTHAZ). This is suggested here to be controlled by the <b>heat</b> <b>tint,</b> and the effect of residual weld oxides on the pitting resistance is studied. The composition and the thickness of weld oxide formed on LDX 2101 and 2304 were determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The <b>heat</b> <b>tint</b> on these lean duplex grades proved to contain significantly more manganese than what has been reported for standard austenitic {{stainless steels}} in the 300 series. A new approach on <b>heat</b> <b>tint</b> formation is consequently presented. Evaporation of material from the weld metal and subsequent deposition on the weld oxide are suggested to contribute to weld oxide formation. This is supported by element loss in LDX 2101 weld metal, and nitrogen additions to the GTA shielding gas further increase the evaporation.  QC 2010112...|$|R

40|$|The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) {{used their}} microtopography {{analysis}} method {{to examine the}} fracture process in two Type 304 stainless steel, part-through crack, plate-type specimens. The two specimens had different initial defect geometries – one being nearly semicircular and moderately deep, the other being longer and shallower. The microtopographic analysis allowed determination of parameters such as: the crack tip opening displacement at initiation; the crack tip opening angle during ductile tearing; the crack mouth opening at through-thickness penetration; and, the incremental crack front profiles throughout the crack growth process. In essence, these data provide a nearly complete description of the entire ductile fracture process for the two cases examined. We describe the microtopographic analysis procedure as it was applied to these two specimens. Crack growth profiles predicted by the microtopography analysis are compared with those shown by <b>heat</b> <b>tinting</b> of the actual fracture subsurface, showing excellent agreement. Several areas of ductile crack growth theory relevant to the microtopographic method of analysis are discussed, including possible effects on {{the accuracy of the}} analyses.

40|$|High cycle fatigue (HCF) {{has been}} of great concern of late {{in light of the}} many HCF gas turbine engine {{failures}} experienced by the U. S. Air Force. Due to the high frequency, failures occur rapidly when components sustain damage from other sources. Low cycle fatigue (LCF) can initiate cracks that produce such damage. This study investigates the HCF threshold of Ti- 6 A 1 - 4 V when naturally initiated small surface cracks (2 a = 25 μm– 600 μm) are present. Small surface cracks are initiated in notched specimens using two different LCF loading histories at room temperature and 10 Hz. Direct current potential difference (DCPD) is used to detect crack initiation. Surface crack measurements are made using a scanning electron microscope prior to HCF testing. <b>Heat</b> <b>tinting</b> prior to HCF testing is used to mark the crack front to allow for post fracture crack measurements. HCF thresholds at R = 0. 1 and R = 0. 5 are determined for each specimen using step loading at room temperature and 600 Hz. Additionally, the HCF threshold is measured at R = 0. 1 for specimens with small cracks that have been stress relief annealed to eliminate residual stresses and load history. Long crack thresholds are determined using a similar step loading procedure at R = 0. 1 and R = 0. 5 for specimens which have been precracked using a range of Kmax. Long crack threshold measurements are also determined for specimens which have been precracked using a range of Kmax, but stress relief annealed prior to testing. Comparisons show that HCF threshold measurements, when naturally initiated small cracks are present, are dependent on the load histories that are used to initiate the cracks. Further comparisons show that the measured small crack thresholds follow similar trends for load history effects which occur in the long crack threshold data. Additionally, it is found that thresholds can be measured free of load history effects by using a stress relief annealing process after the precracking and prior to the threshold testing. ...|$|E

40|$|Aircraft engine {{manufacturers}} have {{to demonstrate that}} handling surface anomalies in sensitive areas of discs are not critical for in-service life of a component. Currently, the models used consider anomalies as long cracks propagating from the first cycle, which introduces {{a certain degree of}} conservatism when calculating the fatigue life of surface flaws.

Thus, the aim of the study is to characterize the crack propagation from typical surface anomalies and to establish a new crack growth model, which can account for the micro-propagation stage. To separate the effects of the geometry of the anomalies and the residual stress state after introduction of the surface flaws, two V-type anomalies are studied: scratches and dents. Different studies have shown that the residual stresses beneath the anomalies seem to control the fatigue life of samples exhibiting scratches and dents.

40|$|In this master thesis, {{the focus}} has been on a Ti- 6 Al- 4 V {{specimen}} produced by Norsk Titanium s patented wire-fed plasma deposition technique, under conditions promoting the break up of the traditional large columnar β-grains formed during solidification. Both the final microstructure and strain response have been studied using several different experimental techniques, such as <b>heat</b> <b>tinting,</b> light microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction, EBSD combined with In-Situ tensile experiments. The Ti- 6 Al- 4 V specimen studied in this thesis consisted of several deposited layers, and each individual layer contained several small prior β-grains formed during solidification. This resulted in a microstructure with a large area covered with prior β-grain boundaries, which at room temperature was covered with grain boundary α. α-colonies was frequently observed growing from the grain boundary α, resulting in a microstructure more dominated by α-colony morphology compared to the traditional reported microstructure. The small prior β-grains found in this material did not seem to affect the thickness of the final α-plates at room temperature. However, the size of the prior β-grains was frequently observed to affect the final microstructural morphology found in the grain. Several In-Situ tensile tests were performed on specimens having either the deposition direction (Sample X) or build direction parallel (Sample Z) with the tensile direction. The observed deformation was located along the boundaries of the prior β-grains in all specimens. Inhomogeneous deformation of the samples with the build direction parallel with the tensile direction was observed after the deformed samples had been heat tinted, revealing the macro deformation. Due to the unique solidification morphology in each deposited layer, each layer was observed to deform independently during straining in the specimens from Sample Z. The observed deformation mechanism consisted of slip in both the Prismatic and Basal slip system. The orientation of the crystal structure of a α-colony has proven to be very influential on the deformation and the hard/soft -grain combination was frequently observed where most of the deformation took place...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to quantify the effect of fretting fatigue stress histories on fatigue crack growth and the fatigue crack growth thresholds due to High Cycle Fatigue (HCF) loading. The approach used to meet this objective consists of both experimental and analytical studies with the experimental results helping to verify the analysis. ^ Test pieces from Ti- 6 Al- 4 V fretting fatigue experiments were examined and fatigue tested. The first type of experiment involved interruption of the fretting fatigue experiment prior to failure followed by continued fatigue testing of the specimen under remote loading without fretting. The crack growth and coalescence of the fretting cracks located at the edge of contact was recorded and compared to fracture mechanics analysis. The analysis conservatively predicted the growth to failure in these specimens. For the second type of experiment a unique fatigue specimen was designed from the fretting pad used in the fretting fatigue experiments. This fretting pad was subject to high local contact stresses that could initiate cracks, but they would not propagate to failure due to the lack of a bulk cyclic tension. The fatigue crack growth thresholds of these fretting cracks were measured by step testing. The cracks were measured from the fracture surface after failure with the aid of <b>heat</b> <b>tinting.</b> The measured fatigue crack growth thresholds of these cracks were consistent with a small crack threshold model. Many of the specimens were stress relieved prior to testing to eliminate load history effects and ultimately no fretting load history effect on the threshold was conclusively observed. ^ Crack initiation, propagation, and threshold models were applied to the results of the experiments conducted for this research with mixed success. These models were then applied to the fretting fatigue experiments performed by other researchers. Stress life and constant life diagrams were created and compared well with the experimental data. The affect of various fretting load parameters on the fatigue life and threshold predictions was investigated. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{additions}} of Nb, Al and Mo to Fe-C-Mn-Si TRIP steel {{on the final}} microstructure and mechanical properties after simulated thermomechanical processing (TMP) has been studied. The laboratory simulations of discontinuous cooling during TMP were performed using a hot rolling mill. All samples were characterised using optical microscopy and image analysis. The volume fraction of retained austenite was ascertained using a <b>heat</b> <b>tinting</b> technique and X-ray diffraction measurements. Room temperature mechanical properties were determined by a tensile test. From this a comprehensive understanding of the structural aspect of the bainite transformation in these types of TRIP steels has been developed. The results {{have shown that the}} final microstructures of thermomechanically processed TRIP steels comprise 50 % of polygonal ferrite, 7 - 12 % of retained austenite, non-carbide bainitic structure and martensite. All steels exhibited a good combination of ultimate tensile strength and total elongation. The microstructure-property examination revealed the relationship between the composition of TRIP steels and their mechanical properties. It has been shown that the addition of Mo to the C-Si-Mn-Nb TRIP steel increases the ultimate tensile strength up to 1020 MPa. The stability of the retained austenite of the Nb-Mo steel was degraded, which led to a decrease in the elongation (24 %). The results have demonstrated that the addition of Al to C-Si-Mn-Nb steel leads to a good combination of strength (∼ 940 MPa) and elongation (∼ 30 %) due to the formation of refined acicular ferrite and granular bainite structure with ∼ 7 - 8 % of stable retained austenite. Furthermore, it has been found that the addition of Al increases the volume fraction of bainitic ferrite laths. The investigations have shown an interesting result that, in the Nb-Mo-Al steel, Al has a more pronounced effect on the microstructure in comparison with Mo. It has been found that the bainitic structure of the Nb-Mo-Al steel appears to be more granular than in the Nb-Mo steel. Moreover, the volume fraction of the retained austenite increased (12 %) with decreasing bainitic ferrite content. The results have demonstrated that this steel has the best mechanical properties (1100 MPa and 28 % elongation). It has been concluded that the combined effect of Nb, Mo, and Al addition on the dispersion of the bainite, martensite and retained austenite in the ferrite matrix and the morphology of these phases is different than effect of Nb, Mo and Al, separately. <br /...|$|E

Electrochemical and surface analytical methods were used to understand the effects of pickling on the stainless steel weldments. Cyclic potentiodynamic polarization (CPP) test results indicated that the restoration of passivity of stainless steel weldments could be achieved by pickling the weldments in both HF/HNO 3 solution and NH 4 F/HNO 3 solutions. Scanning electron microscopy observation of the UNS S 32750 weldment surface revealed that both the HF/HNO 3 solution and the NH 4 F/HNO 3 solution could remove the <b>heat</b> <b>tint</b> on the weldment.

40|$|Duplex {{stainless}} steels {{can be very}} attractive alternatives to austenitic grades due to their almost double strength at equal pitting corrosion resistance. When welding, the duplex alloys normally require addition of filler metal, while the commodity austenitic grades can often be welded autogenously. Over-alloyed consumables are used to counteract segregation of important alloying elements and to balance the two phases, ferrite and austenite, in the duplex weld metal. This work focuses on the weldability of the recently-developed lean duplex stainless steel LDX 2101 ® (EN 1. 4162, UNS S 32101). The pitting corrosion resistance of this grade is better than that of austenitic AISI 304 (EN 1. 4307) and can reach the level of AISI 316 L (EN 1. 4404). The austenite formation is rapid in LDX 2101 compared to older duplex grades. Pitting resistance tests performed show that 1 - 2. 5 mm thick laser and gas tungsten arc (GTA) welded LDX 2101 can have good corrosion properties even when welding autogenously. Additions of filler metal, nitrogen in the shielding gas, nitrogen-based backing gas and use of laser hybrid welding methods, however, increase the austenite formation. The pitting resistance may also be increased by suppressing formation of chromium nitrides in the weld metal and heat affected zone (HAZ). After thorough post-weld cleaning (pickling), pitting primarily occurred 1 - 3 mm from the fusion line, in the parent metal {{rather than in the}} HAZ. Neither the chromium nitride precipitates found in the HAZ, nor the element depletion along the fusion line that was revealed by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) were found to locally decrease the pitting resistance. The preferential pitting location is suggested to be controlled by the residual weld oxide composition that varies over the surface. The composition and thickness of weld oxide formed on LDX 2101 and 2304 (EN 1. 4362, UNS S 32304) were determined using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The <b>heat</b> <b>tint</b> on these lean duplex grades proved to contain significantly more manganese than what has been reported for standard austenitic {{stainless steels}} in the AISI 300 series. A new approach to <b>heat</b> <b>tint</b> formation is presented; whereby evaporation of material from the weld metal and subsequent deposition on the already-formed weld oxide are suggested to contribute to weld oxide formation. This is consistent with manganese loss from the weld metal, and nitrogen additions to the GTA shielding gas enhance the evaporation. The segregation of all elements apart from nitrogen is low in autogenously welded LDX 2101. This means that filler wire additions may not be required as for other duplex grades assuming that there is no large nitrogen loss that could cause excessive ferrite contents. As the nitrogen appears to be controlling the austenite formation, it becomes essential to avoid losing nitrogen during welding by choosing nitrogen-containing shielding and backing gas.

40|$|Defects {{that develop}} in welds during the {{fabrication}} process are frequently manifested as embedded flaws {{from lack of}} fusion or lack of penetration. Fracture analyses of welded structures {{must be able to}} assess the effect of such defects on the structural integrity of weldments; however, the transferability of R-curves measured in laboratory specimens to defective structural welds has not been fully examined. In the current study, the fracture behavior of an overmatched butt weld containing a simulated buried, lack-of-penetration defect is studied. A specimen designed to simulate pressure vessel butt welds is considered; namely, a center crack panel specimen, of 1. 25 inch by 1. 25 inch cross section, loaded in tension. The stress-relieved double-V weld has a yield strength 50 % higher than that of the plate material, and displays upper shelf fracture behavior at room temperature.

Calibrating data for the finite element analyses, namely cell size and initial material porosities are obtained by matching computational predictions to experimental results from tests of welded compact tension specimens.

40|$|The {{excellent}} {{corrosion resistance}} of stainless steels {{arises from the}} presence of a passive film on its surface. Above 10. 5 wt% Cr a chromium oxide of 1 - 3 nm is formed {{on the surface of the}} metal that in case of damage will reform and hinder further dissolution of the metal. However, the passivity of the stainless steel can be altered by material factors and external factors; such as the composition of the underlying phases, external loads or thermal treatments. In this work the local electrochemical techniques Scanning Vibrating Electrode Technique (SVET) and Scanning Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (SKPFM) and the local characterization techniques X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) have been used to investigate corrosion phenomena of stainless alloys based on measurements of corrosion current density, work function, thickness and composition of the oxide. The effect on work function of the thickness of the passive film and composition of the underlying phases was investigated for 301 LN austenitic stainless steel (Paper I) and a heat treated superduplex 25 Cr 7 Ni type stainless steel (Paper II). It was shown that the work function can be an indicator of corrosion resistance of the phases in the microstructure, and that the composition of the underlying phases had a greater effect on the work function than the thickness of the passive film. External factors such mechanical deformation (Paper I) and welding (Paper III) altered the passivity of the steel and work function. It was found that plastic deformation decreased irreversibly the work function, whereas elastic deformation did not have any permanent effect. Thermal oxides affected the passivity of stainless steels welded joints and were detrimental for its corrosion resistance.

50|$|Due to the {{precision}} of orbital TIG welding, even the smallest standard tube diameters from 1.6 millimetres can be processed. On a larger scale, pipes with diameters up to 170mm and walls up to 3.5mm thick can be joined using closed chamber weld heads. These weld heads allow the torch to be positioned very precisely and ensure that the pipe is held securely. The inert gas atmosphere in the closed chamber prevents <b>heat</b> from <b>tinting,</b> even with the most sensitive of materials.

A flexible hose system is used to supply the welding head with power, inert gas, cooling water and filler wire where required. The need for filler wire during the welding process depends on the type of welding task; thicker tube walls and difficult-to-control parent materials require the use of additional material, whereas thin-walled tubes can be welded without extra wire.In order to create high quality weld seams it is essential that tube ends are carefully prepared with the edges of the workpieces being free of scale and impurities. For thinner-walled tubes up to medium diameters, a simple right-angled saw cut is often sufficient. For thicker tube walls it is necessary to prepare the edges more carefully, for example using a U-groove cross-section.|$|R
40|$|Electrochemical noise (EN) probes were {{deployed}} in the carbon steel continuous kraft digester at Spring Grove at four locations and at one location in the bottom cone of the associated flash tank for a second consecutive year of a corrosion study. The probes contained dual electrodes of 309 LSi stainless steel overlay [...] representing a field repair material applied to {{a portion of the}} vessel [...] and dual electrodes of 312 stainless steel overlay. Current and potential noise, the temperature at each probe location, and the value of 23 process parameters (flow rates, liquor chemistry, etc.) were again monitored continuously for a period of almost one year. Historical vessel inspection data and post-test evaluation of the probe components were used to assess/compare EN corrosion activity with physical changes in wall thickness and corrosion patterns on the digester shell. In addition, attempts were made to correlate EN activity from each electrode type with process parameters. The results indicate the corrosion conditions aggressive to mild steel persist within the digester, as post-test inspection of the vessel revealed localized corrosion of mild steel in locations previously free of attack. Further, there was evidence that the depth of localized attack of exposed steel had increased in some locations. Nevertheless, the stainless steel overlay in the digester was essentially immune to corrosion, as evidenced by retained surface relief and <b>heat</b> <b>tint</b> associated with the original deposition process. The 309 LSi electrodes also appeared visually pristine, and post-exposure metallographic examination of the 309 LSi electrode materials revealed no attack. The 312 electrode materials were similar in appearance, but exhibited very minor interdendritic attack over the exposed surface. The silver electrodes in the probes were consumed (to Ag{sub 2 }S) to variable degree {{over the course of the}} exposure indicating a useful life of not more than a year in digester service in this vessel. Since the stainless steel overlay electrodes were immune to corrosion during the exposure, the current and potential noise activity on these probes is likely related to redox processes on the electrode surfaces. Analysis of this activity as a function of position (and year) in the vessel suggests that redox chemistry/conditions vary by a significant amount on a consistent basis [...] even on opposite sides of the vessel at the same elevation [...] and that these differences are not identified by process parameters tracked at the mill. These variable environmental conditions (flow, temperature, liquor chemistry) appear to have little effect on stainless steel overlays under evaluation, but apparently can be quite corrosive to steel as determined in the initial study in the digester at Spring Grove. With the exception of start-up and shutdown activity, including brief upsets for ''hanging columns'' or brief maintenance periods, no regular correlation was observed between tracked process variables and EN activity on any of the probes. In combination with the variable redox activity, this result suggests that the liquor sampling and flow data compiled at the mill do not represent the corrosion conditions in the vessel particularly well...|$|R
