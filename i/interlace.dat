They {{are one of}} three forms of Islamic decoration, the others being the arabesque based on curving and branching plant forms, and Islamic calligraphy; all three are frequently used together. Geometric designs and arabesques are forms of Islamic <b>interlace</b> patterns.|$|E
5|$|One type of coin for Beonna has no named moneyer and depicts an <b>interlace</b> motif on its reverse. A {{specimen}} {{of this type}} (now lost) was found at Dorestad, which was during Beonna's time an important trading centre: these coins resemble Frankish or Frisian deniers that were issued from the Maastricht area during this period.|$|E
5|$|The presidential sash is a Croatian tricolour band, {{trimmed with}} gold and adorned with the {{coat of arms}} of Croatia, which is placed in a white field, with the tricolour at the front. The arms are bordered by oak {{branches}} {{on the left and}} olive branches on the right. The sash is worn diagonally, over the right shoulder, and is fastened using a square clasp trimmed with golden Croatian <b>interlace.</b> The sash is adorned with the arms used on the presidential standard, although without the ribbon used in the arms. The constitution specifies that the sash is worn on Statehood Day, during awards ceremonies, during the acceptance of letters of credence and in other ceremonial occasions. The presidential sash was not in use since 2000 inauguration of Stjepan Mesić.|$|E

40|$|DE 102006026895 B 3 UPAB: 20071126 NOVELTY - The device has an <b>interlacing</b> device (10) {{changing}} {{a sequence of}} <b>interlacing</b> units to receive <b>interlaced</b> code words (CW 1 -CW 3), where the <b>interlacing</b> device does not change sequence of symbols within the <b>interlacing</b> units. The code words are derived from an input block of symbols. The <b>interlacing</b> device changes the sequence of <b>interlacing</b> units such {{that one of the}} <b>interlacing</b> units of preceding or succeeding code words is arranged between the <b>interlacing</b> units of the code words. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (1) a transmitter for producing a transmission signal (2) a method for processing a code word (3) a receiver for receiving signals (4) a method for receiving of signals (5) a computer program with a program code for executing a method for processing a code word. USE - Used for processing a code word in a digital transmission process. ADVANTAGE - The <b>interlacing</b> device changes the sequence of <b>interlacing</b> units to receive the <b>interlaced</b> code words, where the <b>interlacing</b> device does not change sequence of symbols within the <b>interlacing</b> units, thus reducing administration and storage complexity for processing the code words, and maintaining good efficiency in transmission of the code words to channels with slow variable channel characteristics...|$|R
50|$|<b>Interlaced</b> {{video is}} {{designed}} to be captured, stored, transmitted, and displayed in the same <b>interlaced</b> format. Because each <b>interlaced</b> video frame is two fields captured at different moments in time, <b>interlaced</b> video frames can exhibit motion artifacts known as <b>interlacing</b> effects, or combing, if recorded objects move fast enough to be in different positions when each individual field is captured. These artifacts may be more visible when <b>interlaced</b> video is displayed at a slower speed than it was captured, or in still frames.|$|R
5|$|The second {{cross is}} tall and slender, a free {{standing}} monolith pillar-cross, with a slender rounded shaft (changing to square above) and a free armed head formed by notching the shaft. It is carved with figures in traditional Welsh style. One figure in particular, which looks much like {{the figure of a}} saint, is inscribed low on the north face. The Cross of St Padarn is granophyre and has Celtic <b>interlace</b> in panels down one face. It is uncertainly dated between the ninth and eleventh century. Though not comparable with the great Irish high crosses, it shows sophisticated carving, and willingness to bring the stone from the Mawdddach estuary, Gwynedd.|$|E
5|$|The royal arms of CharlesII are in {{the north}} aisle. During the 1852 {{restoration}} whitewash {{was removed from the}} walls, revealing the royal arms of HenryVII, and paintings which include one of The Blessed Virgin knighting St George. Stained glass in the west windows of both aisles dates from around 1500. Other glass comes from the Victorian era. This includes the east window from about 1858, and the window at the east end of the north aisle from about 1861, both by William Warrington, and the east window in the south aisle from about 1872 by Ward and Hughes. The two westernmost windows in the south aisle are by O'Connor and dated 1871. There are later windows from 1920 in the south wall of the Lady Chapel. In the north aisle is a small part of an Anglo-Saxon circular cross-shaft carved with <b>interlace</b> decoration dating from the late 10th or the 11thcentury.|$|E

50|$|The {{disadvantage}} of progressive scan {{is that it}} requires higher bandwidth than <b>interlaced</b> video that has the same frame size and vertical refresh rate. Because of this 1080p is not used for broadcast. For explanations of why <b>interlacing</b> was originally used, see <b>interlaced</b> video.

50|$|Kell {{factor is}} {{sometimes}} incorrectly stated to exist {{to account for}} the effects of <b>interlacing.</b> <b>Interlacing</b> itself does not affect Kell factor, but because <b>interlaced</b> video must be low-pass filtered (i.e., blurred) in the vertical dimension to avoid spatio-temporal aliasing (i.e., flickering effects), the Kell factor of <b>interlaced</b> video is said to be about 70% that of progressive video with the same scan line resolution.|$|R

50|$|Most modern {{computer}} monitors {{do not support}} <b>interlaced</b> video, besides some legacy text-only display modes. Playing back <b>interlaced</b> video on a computer display requires some form of deinterlacing in the software player, which often uses very simple methods to deinterlace. This means that <b>interlaced</b> video often has visible artifacts on computer systems. Computer systems {{may be used to}} edit <b>interlaced</b> video, but the disparity between computer video display systems and <b>interlaced</b> television signal formats means that the video content being edited cannot be viewed properly without separate video display hardware.|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we {{extend the}} Richardson-Lucy (RL) method to block-iterative versions, {{separated}} BI-RL, and <b>interlaced</b> BI-RL, for image deblurring applications. We propose combining algorithms for separated BI-RL to form block artifact-free output images from separately deblurred block images. For <b>interlaced</b> BI-RL {{to accelerate the}} iteration, we propose an <b>interlaced</b> block-iteration algorithm on down-sampled blocks of the observed image. Simulation studies show that separated BI-RL and <b>interlaced</b> BI-RL achieve desired goals in Gaussian and diagonal deblurrings.|$|R
5000|$|Sony adapted HDV, {{originally}} {{conceived as}} progressive-scan format by JVC, to <b>interlaced</b> video. <b>Interlaced</b> video {{has been a}} useful compromise for decades due to its ability to display motion smoothly while reducing recording and transmission bandwidth. <b>Interlaced</b> video is still being used in acquisition and broadcast, but <b>interlaced</b> display devices are being phased out. Modern flat-panel television sets that utilize plasma and LCD technology are inherently progressive. All modern computer monitors use progressive scanning as well.|$|R

These modes share many properties, such as {{synchronization}} and/or frequencies and grey/color level correspondence. Their main difference is the image quality, which is proportional to the time taken to transfer the image and in the case of the AVT modes, related to synchronous data transmission methods and noise resistance conferred by the use of <b>interlace.</b>|$|E
