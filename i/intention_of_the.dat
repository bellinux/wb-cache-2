5|$|For the {{introduction}} of London Underground services, the original station was completely demolished and rebuilt. The station was provided with two additional platforms, giving four in total. The platforms comprise two parallel islands with tracks on both sides. This was necessary as the <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Northern Heights project was that trains {{would be able to}} run south from East Finchley to Highgate via both the surface and the underground routes. The inner pair of tracks served the surface route, whilst the outer pair serve the tunnel route.|$|E

He is buried with his three wives, although only two are depicted on the sarcophagus designed by Willem Boy. The king and his wives are interred in what was once the Chapel of the Virgin Mary. The only remaining indication of the original <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chapel are the painted yellow stars against a blue background on its vaulted ceiling, symbols of Saint Mary in Catholic tradition.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} prestigious clubs in Australia was the Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC), which was formed in 1838, only three years after the {{founding}} of Melbourne. The MCC dominated cricket in Australia {{for the rest of the}} century. Although club membership was intended for the social elite, similar to that of leading English clubs at the time, its ability to secure the best cricketers in its teams made it enormously popular with spectators; the <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MCC seems to have been to spread cricket's popularity in a similar way to the Marylebone Cricket Club's efforts in England.|$|E

5|$|The bombardments {{failed to}} cause {{significant}} physical damage, {{but had a}} major psychological impact on the residents of Sydney and Newcastle. Due to the inaccuracy of the submarines' range-finding equipment, coupled with the unstable firing platform of a submarine at sea, specific targeting was impossible.

5|$|The {{botanic garden}} {{may be an}} {{independent}} institution, a governmental operation, or affiliated to a college or university. If a department of an educational institution, it {{may be related to}} a teaching program. In any case, it exists for scientific ends and is not to be restricted or diverted by other demands. It is not merely a landscaped or ornamental garden, although it may be artistic, nor is it an experiment station or yet a park with labels on the plants. The essential element is the <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enterprise, which is the acquisition and dissemination of botanical knowledge.|$|E
5|$|The <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{union was}} to create a common state under Władysław Jagiełło, but the ruling oligarchy of Poland learned that their goal of {{incorporating}} Lithuania into Poland was unrealistic. Territorial disputes led to warfare between Poland and Lithuania or Lithuanian factions; the Lithuanians at times even found it expedient to conspire with the Teutonic Knights against the Poles. Geographic consequences of the dynastic union and the preferences of the Jagiellonian kings instead created a process of orientating Polish territorial priorities to the east.|$|E

This is still visible today when traveling on a southbound Metropolitan line service.|$|E

5|$|Baruch Kimmerling and Joel S. Migdal {{argue that}} the revolt was a {{formative}} event for the Palestinian sense of nationhood in that it brought together disparate groups against a common enemy. Moreover, they asserted that these groups reemerged later to constitute the Palestinian people. The revolt represented a moment of political unity in Palestine. However, the ultimate <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> notables and rebel leaders was to force out the Egyptian army and reinstate Ottoman rule {{as a means of}} restoring the Ottoman-era standards that defined the relationship {{between the government and the}} governed. These standards were made up of the religious laws, administrative codes and local norms and traditions that were disrupted by Egyptian reforms.|$|E
5|$|On 3 November 1914, Churchill {{ordered the}} first British {{attack on the}} Dardanelles {{following}} the opening of hostilities between Turkey and Russia. The attack {{was carried out by}} Indomitable and Indefatigable, as well as the French pre-dreadnought battleships Suffren and Vérité. The <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> attack was to test the fortifications and measure the Turkish response. The results were deceptively encouraging. In a twenty-minute bombardment, a single shell struck the magazine of the fort at Sedd el Bahr {{at the tip of the}} Gallipoli peninsula, displacing (but not destroying) 10 guns and killing 86 Turkish soldiers. The most significant consequence was that the attention of the Turks was drawn to strengthening their defences, and they set about expanding the mine field. This attack actually took place before a formal declaration of war had been made by Britain against the Ottoman Empire which didn't happen until the 5th. Indomitable was ordered to return to England in December where she joined the 2nd BCS.|$|E
5|$|Rain World is a 2017 {{survival}} platformer {{video game}} in which the player controls a part-slug, part-cat creature searching a hostile, derelict world for its family. The Slugcat uses debris as weapons to escape randomized enemies, forage for food, and reach safe hibernation rooms before a deadly torrential rain arrives. The player is given little explicit guidance on how to survive, which was the <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> developers, who wanted players {{to feel like a}} rat living on subway tracks, in which they learn to survive in an environment without grasping its higher-level function. Rain World was developed by Videocult, a small indie team, over six years and published by Adult Swim Games for PlayStation 4 and Windows in March 2017. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its art design and fluid animations, but disliked its brutal difficulty and imprecise controls.|$|E

5|$|The DPP {{argued that}} it was never the <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Chaser to breach {{security}} and that they were allowed into the restricted area only because of the mistakes of the police. The laws enacted for the summit meant that entry into the restricted zone needed justification, which could include police permission. The DPP stated that by waving The Chaser through, they had granted permission to be in the restricted zone. A further defence was available: all members charged, except Morrow, could argue that they were present for work-related purposes, and part of their employment was to be with Morrow, who was directing the stunt.|$|E
5|$|The New York Giants are a National Football League (NFL) {{franchise}} {{founded in}} the 1925 season, the NFL's sixth. Eleven years later, the league introduced the NFL draft after team owners voted on it in 1935. The <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> draft {{was to make the}} NFL more competitive, as a few stronger teams, including the Giants, had an advantage in signing young players because they were able to offer higher salaries and an opportunity to compete for championships. Since that first draft, the Giants have selected 74 players in the first round. The team's first-round pick in the inaugural NFL draft was Art Lewis, a tackle from Ohio University; he was the 9th overall selection. In the most recent draft, held in 2017, the Giants chose Mississippi tight end Evan Engram.|$|E
5|$|The historians David Glantz and Jonathan House {{asserted}} that the original <b>intention</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 4th Panzer Army command was to drive northwards, with its two panzer corps driving abreast, toward Oboyan and then Kursk; but that on 9 July, due to heavy Soviet resistance {{along the road to}} Oboyan, Hoth was forced to disastrously, although not knowing it at the time, alter his plan by ordering the II SS-Panzer Corps to swing from the northwesterly direction to the northeast toward Prokhorovka. Therefore, according to Glantz and House, the Battle of Prokhorova was not a result of original intention nor planned for, but was rather engendered by tactically flawed, late improvisations to the original German plan.|$|E
