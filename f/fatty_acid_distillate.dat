Increasing dietary CSP level decreased DM, ether extract (EE) and crude protein (CP) CTTAD (by 4. 0, 11. 1 and 3. 5 %, respectively, P < 0. 05), but did not influence those of fibrous constituents. It also led to a decrease (from 475 to 412 g/kg DM, P < 0. 001) of faecal concentration of neutral detergent fibre (aNDFom) and to an increment (from 138 to 204 g/kg, P < 0. 001) of EE in faecal DM that was related to greater CH 4 emissions, both per gram of organic matter (P = 0. 021) or on a daily basis (P < 0. 001). Level of CSP did not affect N content in faeces or urine, but increased daily DM (P < 0. 001), and N (P = 0. 031) faecal excretion with no effect on urine N excretion. This resulted in lesser (P = 0. 036) NH 3 potential emission per kg of slurry. Addition of OP decreased CTTAD of EE (by 7. 9 %, P = 0. 044), but increased (P < 0. 05) that of all the fibrous fractions. As a consequence, faecal EE content increased (from 165 to 177 g/kg DM; P = 0. 012), and aNDFom decreased greatly (from 483 to 404 g/kg DM, P < 0. 001), which in all resulted in a lack of effect of OP on CH 4 potential emission. Inclusion of OP in the diet also led to a significant decrease of CP CTTAD (by 6. 85 %, P < 0. 001), and to an increase of faecal CP concentration (from 174 to 226 g/kg DM, P < 0. 001), with no significant influence on urine N content. These effects resulted in higher N faecal losses, especially those of the undigested dietary origin, without significant effects on potential NH 3 emission. No significant interactions between CSP and OP supplementation were observed for the gaseous emissions measured...|$|R
40|$|Metal-on-metal (MoM) hip {{replacements}} {{are commonly}} used hip implants. However, {{one of the issues}} under debate is the interference of friction and wear. The purpose of this feasibility study is to elucidate the performance of palm lubrication between the femoral head and the acetabular cup. In the tribology of hip implants, the use of palm olein, palm kernel oil, and palm <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> <b>distillate</b> as synthetic lubricants for human joints has shown tremendous potential. A modified pin-on-disc as hip screening has been used to evaluate the friction and wear on an acetabular cup with an inner diameter of 28 mm. The wear debris was then observed with microscopy image analysis. This study revealed that the physical and unique chemical properties in palm oil can optimize the rate of friction and wear on the metal acetabular cup and thus allow for a stable implant of MoM...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{renewable}} green fuel is produced using a by-product generated during the purification process of palm oil refinery, known as palm <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> <b>distillate</b> (PFAD). PFAD {{has been considered}} as the most promising biodiesel feedstock despite its drawbacks of high free fatty acid (FFA) and water content. In order to overcome these problems, the organophosphonic acid-functionalized rice husk silica (OP-RHS) catalyst was used in esterification of PFAD. Parametric study has been conducted and the optimal conditions were found to be: MeOH:oil molar ratio of 15 : 1 and 8 wt. % catalyst amount at 100 °C, yielding highest methyl ester content 88. 6 % at 8 h reaction time. The catalyst could maintain a high catalytic activity (> 80 %) even during the fourth cycles. The research results show that OP-RHS is a potential catalyst for biodiesel production using high FFA and moisture content feedstock...|$|E

40|$|Cellular <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> {{phospholipid}} <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> and lipopolysaccharide <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> of four {{strains of}} Helicobacter pylori {{were analyzed by}} gas-liquid chromatography. The presence of myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, 19 -carbon cyclopropane <b>fatty</b> <b>acid,</b> beta-hydroxypalmitic acid, and beta-hydroxystearic acid was confirmed. In phospholipids, myristic acid and 19 -carbon cyclopropane <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> were the major <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> Hydroxy <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> and unsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were not detected or occurred only in small amounts. The major <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> of lipopolysaccharides were stearic acid, beta-hydroxypalmitic acid, and beta-hydroxystearic <b>acid.</b> Unsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> and 19 -carbon cyclopropane <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> were not found.

40|$|The {{type and}} amount of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> uptaken by cells are of vital {{importance}} for health. In this study we investigated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> uptake by cells in context with <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> supplementation. Due to cell incubation the concentration of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in the culture medium was dwindled, as expected. We observed that <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> prominent in the culture medium were diminished to a much greater extent than <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> contained in the medium in marginal amounts. The supplemented <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were incorporated into the cells regardless {{of the type of}} <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> added. Beyond that, <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> from the n 3 and the n 6 family were metabolized, resulting in an increase of their desaturation and elongation products. The supplementation of the culture medium with a special <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> did not affect the incorporation rates of the remaining <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> contained in the culture medium. Thus, an increased supply of unsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> is not sufficient to lessen the uptake of saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> by cells...|$|R
