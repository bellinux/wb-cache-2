25|$|The {{style of}} the station was well {{received}} by listeners. In 1976, a new FM studio was built <b>just</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> road from the old studio in Brampton on a very limited budget. Engineers Mike Hargrave Pawson and Steve Martak built the new studio and a new transmitter site in Georgetown to increase the coverage from 857 watts to 100kW ERP.|$|E
25|$|Finally, in {{the fall}} of 1887, Willcox and Reid, after garnering {{interest}} in their fellow students throughout the year, helped Virginia put its first regularly organized team in the field. But in these early days they had had no one to play. Fortunately, Pantops Academy, a boys' school founded <b>just</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> road from the UVA Grounds, agreed to a game on November 13, 1887. After playing to a scoreless tie, a rematch was scheduled for March 1888. The historic first touchdown was scored by quarterback Herbert Barry and the University won 26–0.|$|E
25|$|The station {{opened on}} April 15, 1918. It {{was named after}} Woodlawn Road, the former name of Bainbridge Avenue, but is most often {{associated}} with Woodlawn Cemetery, whose main entrance is <b>just</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> street. Woodlawn Road was renamed years ago, but the old name persists to this day on some signs. Woodlawn, though, became even more densely populated after the station opened. The cemetery, which had lobbied for a stop nearby, benefited as well. It opened a sales office {{to deal with the}} demand for burial plots. The subway's connection to Harlem led to many Harlem Renaissance figures such as Duke Ellington and W. C. Handy being buried at Woodlawn.|$|E

[...] He only planned it as a raid, but he also {{believed}} that New London {{could be used as a}} base for further operations into the interior of New England if a permanent British occupation could be established.

[...] In the book [...] Eden Park: A History, the authors write, [...] "Certainly the rough paddock strewn with stones, studded with outcrops of rock and streaked with cowpats, falling away to a boggy trough that filled in a downpour and remained flooded throughout the winter, looked better suited to frog-hunting or duck-shooting than cricket, let alone rugby.

On 5 September, orders arrived for the PC-1264 to proceed to Norfolk, where Lieutenant Purdon would turn over command to Lt. Hardmann.
