But from Burkina Faso comes an idea to overcome this problem - processing yams into couscous. This new produce takes two forms: enriched couscous which can be kept for up to eight months and ordinary couscous which can be kept for a year or even longer. Yam couscous takes the form of pre-cooked granules and can only be distinguished from wheat couscous by its taste and its white colour. The trickiest stage of the processing lies in the crushing. Peeled yams are first of all cooked for 45 to 50 minutes and then crushed. If this is done too quickly, crushing produces a paste; but if it is done too slowly, the result is a flour. The couscous is then dried for 72 hours. If the drying is not done properly the couscous will turn mouldy and black and no-one will buy it. Drying produces grains of differing sizes which are prepared {{in the same way as}} normal couscous.

Tracer bands were installed at planting, and leaves were sampled at intervals throughout the growing season. Background Sr concentrations in leaves were found to be closely related to leaf Ca concentrations, allowing the expected background Sr to be calculated from the Ca concentration in each sample. The ratio of observed to expected Sr did not alter significantly with time of sampling or leaf age for control plants providing a robust parameter for comparison across harvests. Plants at all horizontal distances from the Sr placement up to 5. 5 m showed significant elevation of leaf Sr by 13 weeks after planting (WAP). The depth placement at 15 cm showed earliest Sr elevation, followed by the 7 cm placement. However, both 25 cm and 40 cm placements resulted in significant leaf Sr elevation by 13 WAP, and their final Sr concentrations at 27 WAP did not differ significantly from those of shallower placements. Three fertilizer placement options were compared with respect to Sr uptake by the treated plants and by those in adjacent rows. Placement in a ring around the crown of the seed sett resulted in high leaf Sr concentration at 5 WAP, declining considerably at subsequent samplings. Placement underneath the seed sett produced a similar pattern but at lower concentrations. Banding midway between the plant rows, 0. 5 m from plants, yielded a small increase at 5 WAP increasing to 13 WAP, and ultimately attaining similar concentrations to the other two placements.

Despite its economic and cultural importance, very little is known about its origin, diversity and genetics. As a consequence, breeding efforts for resistance to its main disease, anthracnose, have been fairly limited. The objective of this study was to contribute to the understanding of D. alata genetic diversity by genotyping 384 accessions from different geographical regions (South Pacific, Asia, Africa and the Caribbean), using 24 microsatellite markers. Diversity structuration was assessed via Principal Coordinate Analysis, UPGMA analysis and the Bayesian approach implemented in STRUCTURE. Our results revealed the existence of a wide genetic diversity and a significant structuring associated with geographic origin, ploidy levels and morpho-agronomic characteristics. Seventeen major groups of genetically close cultivars have been identified, including eleven groups of diploid cultivars, four groups of triploids and two groups of tetraploids. STRUCTURE revealed the existence of six populations in the diploid genetic pool and a few admixed cultivars. These results will be very useful for rationalizing D. alata genetic resources in breeding programs across different regions and for improving germplasm conservation methods. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

Organic management resulted in significantly higher yield of 20 % (57. 10 tonnes/ha) over conventional practice (47. 61 tonnes/ha) in elephant foot yam. Organic management also produced significantly higher yield in all the three species of yams (pooled mean of 22. 21, 21. 96 and 16. 83 tonnes/ha for white yam, <b>greater</b> <b>yam</b> and lesser yam respectively). The yield increase observed under organic management in these species was 9 %, 11 % and 7 %, respectively over chemical based farming.

The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess the role of somaclonal {{variations}} in the varietal diversification of these two clonally propagated crops. The study was conducted in six villages located each on distinct islands of Vanuatu, Melanesia. Overall, 203 varieties of taro and 80 varieties of yam were collected and DArTs were used for analysis. The overall quality of the DArT markers was high for both species. The percentage of polymorphic clones detected on the DArT array was low for taro (3 %) and high (13 %) for yam, with respectively 202 and 499 polymorphic clones. Each variety was characterized by its multilocus genotype based on its DArT presence/absence profile. For taro, the 203 varieties were represented by 126 unique genotypes and 34 distinct multilocus lineages (MLLs). The high number of unique genotypes and the presence of few varieties sharing a clonal origin, generated a high varietal richness index (R = 0. 83). For yam, the 80 varieties were represented by seven unique genotypes and 16 MLLs. The low number of unique genotypes and the presence of numerous varieties sharing a clonal origin generated a low varietal richness index (R = 0. 26). Possible factors contributing to these contrasting results are discussed. DArT markers provide evidence that somaclonal variants of taro and yam are selected as new varieties. Strategies aiming at strengthening communities' capacity to adapt to forthcoming changes should consider the introduction of allelic diversity into farmers' varietal portfolios.

40|$|Agronomie {{selection}} generates {{and maintains}} agrobiodiversity {{which can be}} regarded as an essential resource. To describe phenotypic diversity, genotypes as well as their chemical expression, chemotypes, have been widely used. Tropical root and tuber crops are vegetatively propagated and their genetic bases are often narrow. Therefore, unveiling the impressive phenotypic diversity is still rather difficult through genotyping alone, whereas chemotype studies are very informative. Tropical root crops are staples and represent a good source of compounds related to health benefits and used in food and pharmaceutical indu stries. Those crops have keyroles to play in food security for developing countries and so plant breeding cannot be neglected. Biofortification is effective and does not imply change of dietary behaviours. Analysing, computing and compiling data bases for chernical data on diversity of neglected crops are still needed. Biofortification involving mass selection and profiling of numerous accessions is, however, time-consuming. Thus, efficient protocols and tools facilitating this process are required. Chemotypic variability within Vanuatu germplasm was characterised through core samples from different species and relationships between primary compounds, secondary metabolites and local preferences have been studied. Useful correlations were shown, thus clarifying traditional selection process. This process has permitted the definition of ideotypes that will be interesting for the management of breeding programmes.

In spite of its importance, the development of its production is limited by anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz. & Sacc.). This {{is the most important}} disease of D. alata, with yield losses of up to 85 % under favourable condition. Severe damages have been reported on susceptible varieties in the Caribbean, South Pacific, West Africa and India. Considering the high genetic diversity of C. gloeosporioides from yam, the use of durable resistant yam varieties is the most reliable approach to disease management. However, breeding in water yam, a heterozygous plant with an erratic flowering, is a difficult and long process. The speed and precision of breeding can be improved by the development of genetic linkage maps which would provide the basis for locating and hence manipulating quantitative traits such as anthracnose resistance in breeding programmes. Two F 1 populations were developed using two different sources of resistance, ‘Boutou’ and ‘Oriental’ (female clones showing field resistance to anthracnose) crossed by the susceptible male clone ‘Pyramide’. Genetic linkage maps were generated with polymorphic AFLP and microsatellite markers. The resulting maps are the most saturated of all yam maps to date. QTL analysis of anthracnose resistance was performed based on response to two pathogen isolatesunder controlled inoculations. QTLs detected for anthracnose resistance explained 7 to 40 % of the phenotypic variation. These QTLs displayed isolate-specific resistance as well as broad-spectrum resistance. Validation of the identified QTLs was performed based on the reactions of one mapping population in field conditions.
