5|$|The Regency Acts {{allow for}} regencies {{in the event}} of a monarch who is a minor or who is {{physically}} or mentally <b>incapacitated.</b> When a regency is necessary, the next qualified individual in the line of succession automatically becomes regent, unless they themselves are a minor or <b>incapacitated.</b> Special provisions were made for Queen Elizabeth II by the Regency Act 1953, which stated that the Duke of Edinburgh (the Queen's husband) could act as regent in these circumstances.|$|E
5|$|If the {{governor}} dies in office, becomes permanently <b>incapacitated,</b> resigns, or is impeached, {{the lieutenant governor}} becomes governor. In total, ten lieutenant governors become governor by succession. The first occurrence was when Jonathan Jennings resigned to become a congressman and was succeeded by Ratliff Boon.|$|E

A {{substance}} is classified as <b>incapacitating</b> if less than 1/100 of the lethal dose causes incapacitation, e.g., through nausea or visual problems. The distinction between lethal and <b>incapacitating</b> substances is not fixed, but relies on a statistical average called the [...]|$|R
5000|$|There is one {{documented}} case of <b>incapacitating</b> agents {{being used}} in recent years. In 2002, Chechen terrorists took {{a large number of}} hostages in the Moscow theatre siege, and threatened to blow up the entire theatre if any attempt was made to break the siege. An <b>incapacitating</b> agent was used to disable the terrorists whilst the theatre was stormed by special forces. However, the <b>incapacitating</b> agent, unknown at that time, caused many of the hostages to die. The terrorists were rendered unconscious, but roughly 15% of the 800 people exposed were killed by the gas. The situation was not helped {{by the fact that the}} authorities kept the nature of the <b>incapacitating</b> agent secret from doctors trying to treat its victims. At the time, the gas was reported to be an unknown <b>incapacitating</b> agent called [...] "Kolokol-1". The Russian Health Minister Yuri Shevchenko later stated that the <b>incapacitating</b> agent used was a fentanyl derivative.|$|R

5|$|There {{had been}} {{occasions}} when a President was <b>incapacitated.</b> For example, following Woodrow Wilson's stroke no one officially assumed the Presidential powers and duties, {{in part because}} the First Lady, Edith Wilson, together with the White House Physician, Cary T. Grayson, covered up President Wilson's condition.|$|E
5|$|Even {{in areas}} where {{mortality}} was low, so many were <b>incapacitated</b> that much of everyday life was hampered. Some communities closed all stores or required customers to leave orders outside. There were reports that the health-care workers could not tend the sick nor the gravediggers bury the dead because they too were ill. Mass graves were dug by steam shovel and bodies buried without coffins in many places.|$|E

50|$|Bullet wounds vary in {{how much}} they <b>incapacitate</b> an assailant. The greater the injury inflicted, the greater the chance of killing one's assailant or {{wounding}} him so badly {{he is no longer}} able to fight. According to Cooper, larger caliber bullets, being bullets of greater diameter, are more likely to inflict wounds that bleed severely and <b>incapacitate</b> the assailant in a shorter period of time. Jeff Cooper's studies of reports from gun fights pointed to the greater effectiveness of larger diameter bullets in killing or <b>incapacitating</b> an assailant.|$|R
40|$|For land-use planning, French acute {{toxicity}} thresholds are developed {{based on a}} methodology. This method proposes an exhaustive review of acute toxicological data {{and is based on}} expert judgment. Currently, the <b>incapacitating</b> effects are not taken into account in this methodology when setting thresholds. Generally, <b>incapacitating</b> effects are reversible effects but they could prevent the escape or affect the performance of a task. These effects can lead to prolonged exposure to the toxic substance and thus may cause irreversible or even lethal effect. Most of the international agencies (U. S. EPA, AIHA, [...] .) take into account the <b>incapacitating</b> effects in determining {{acute toxicity}} thresholds for emergency. <b>Incapacitating</b> effects can be classified according to their nature (physical, chemical), specificity (local, systemic) and severity. Several options were discussed for the inclusion of this type of effects in the French methodology. First, the definition of the threshold of irreversible effects could be revised to include incapacity. Or a specific paragraph could alert about the possible occurrence of <b>incapacitating</b> effects. Finally, a specific threshold could be developed, intermediate between reversible and irreversible thresholds. Different chemicals were used as case studies to test the different hypotheses. The substances of concern were chlorine, hydrogen fluoride and tetrachloroethylene. As example for tetrachloroethylene, <b>incapacitating</b> effect thresholds has been developed and shown that the third hypothesis seems the most acceptable. Indeed, a threshold of <b>incapacitating</b> effect for tetrachloroethylene is proposed at 250 ppm regardless of the exposure time, based on dizziness and incoordination. This threshold is currently under review...|$|R
5|$|If the {{governor}} becomes <b>incapacitated,</b> then the Lieutenant Governor of Indiana becomes acting-governor until his recovery. Only two governors have become <b>incapacitated</b> during their terms, and current precedent is that {{the governor}}'s office is to notify the lieutenant governor, who will then {{make the decision to}} become acting governor by notifying the General Assembly by letter. The governor can resume his powers and duties by sending a letter to the General Assembly notifying them that he is again capable of executing the duties of office. If the governor resigns, dies, or is impeached, tried, and convicted, then the lieutenant governor becomes governor. If the office of the lieutenant governor is vacant, then the Senate Pro-Tempore becomes governor. If the office of Senate President pro tempore is also vacant, then the Senate must elect a new Pro-Tempore to fill the governor's office.|$|E
5|$|In July 2007, torrential rain flooded {{some of the}} {{traditional}} village centre and primary school. The storm coincided with the annual Glade music festival and jeopardised the event. The festival gates were temporarily closed while organisers assessed the flooding, which submerged one of the stages. The festival's car park was <b>incapacitated,</b> with thousands of revellers stranded {{in the village and}} surrounding lanes.|$|E
5|$|It {{was clear}} that Harrison would not be re-nominated unanimously. Many of Harrison's detractors persisted in pushing for an <b>incapacitated</b> Blaine, though he {{announced}} that he was not a candidate in February 1892. Some party leaders still hoped to draft Blaine into running, and speculation increased when he resigned at the 11th hour as Secretary of State in June. At the convention in Minneapolis, Harrison prevailed on the first ballot, but encountered significant opposition.|$|E

50|$|Stopping {{power is}} the ability of a firearm or other weapon to cause enough {{ballistic}} trauma to a target (human or animal) to immediately <b>incapacitate</b> (and thus stop) the target.

5|$|The {{lieutenant}} governor of Indiana serves as acting governor when the governor becomes <b>incapacitated.</b> In the state's early history, {{lieutenant governor}}s {{would serve as}} acting governor while the governor was away from the capital.

However, this agreement {{did not have}} legal authority. Eisenhower {{suffered a heart attack}} in September 1955 and intestinal problems requiring emergency surgery in July 1956. Each time until Eisenhower was able to resume his duties, Nixon presided over Cabinet meetings and, along with Eisenhower aides, kept the executive branch functioning and assured the public that the situation was under control. However, Nixon never made any effort to formally assume the status of Acting President or President.|$|E
