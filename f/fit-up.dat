[...] It was proven that laser welding is not only feasible in shipbuilding; it is the future of welding in shipbuilding. A proprietary special laser processing tool, FLO (Flexibible Laser Optic), was developed for this application that enables rapid two dimensional scanning and auto focus using a variety of laser sources with output powers up to 15 kW. Welding of thick plates with variable weld seam width was achieved, successfully overcoming the gap and tight tolerance <b>fit-up</b> issues.

5000|$|Haggar {{was born}} in Dedham, Essex, where he was apprenticed as a {{shipbuilder}} and later a watchmaker. An accomplished musician, Haggar left home {{at the age of}} eighteen and joined a troupe of travelling players, working as a stage carpenter. In 1870 he married Sarah Walton, daughter of Richard Walton proprietor of a travelling theatre. The Waltons were a well-known family of professional actors and pantomimists {{who had been in the}} entertaining business for many generations. Shortly after their marriage Haggar and Sarah set up their own company. The couple had eleven children, each born in a different county of England and Wales as their toured their show, each of their children brought up to the profession of the stage. Tragedy struck the family in 1890, when their eldest daughter, Nell, drowned in the River Wye while visiting Chepstow. In 1891 with the birth of their youngest daughter Lillian, the Haggars had eight surviving children, all of whom would later form the regular casts of his films.Moving the theatre deeper into industrial Wales, Haggar found an audience that brought him an unprecedented level of prosperity. The remote villages of Wales welcomed the travelling theatre, known as 'The Castle Theatre', which by now had a repertoire of over a hundred Victorian melodramas and comedies, to which Haggar later included a portable photographic studio having acquired a plate camera.

After a four-week trial engagement with Benson, Payne spent a season touring Britain with a much smaller company, Mademoiselle Gratienne. He returned to Benson the next year, but this engagement was cut short when a fire at the Theatre Royal in Newcastle upon Tyne destroyed the company's stock of scenery and costumes.

40|$|Bolted, {{segmented}} cylindrical shells are {{a common}} structural component in many engineering systems especially for aerospace launch vehicles. Segmented shells are often needed due to limitations of manufacturing capabilities or transportation issues related to very long, large-diameter cylindrical shells. These cylindrical shells typically have a flange or ring welded to opposite ends so that shell segments can be mated together and bolted to form a larger structural system. As the diameter of these shells increases, maintaining strict fabrication tolerances for the flanges to be flat and parallel on a welded structure is an extreme challenge. Local <b>fit-up</b> stresses develop in the structure due to flange mating-surface mismatch (flange waviness).

40|$|The {{quality of}} the {{stamping}} process has a direct effect on laser welded sheet metal assembly. The fixture {{plays an important role}} in the satisfactory metal <b>fit-up</b> that laser welding requires. The traditional ' 3 - 2 - 1 ' locating scheme will no longer suffice for the deformable laser sheet metal assembly process.

This fundamental analysis includes a description of the effect of process parameters on the cross-sectional geometry of the weld. A paper entitled "The influence of joint geometry and <b>fit-up</b> gaps on hybrid laser-MIG welding" This paper analyses the effect of the geometry of the pre-welded joint on the final weld cross-section.

The TF configuration is wedged and uses C 17510 high strength, high conductivity beryllium copper alloy which was developed for BPX in the inner leg, where the stress is highest. In FY 01, a slightly larger design was adopted (R= 2. 14 m. compared to the previous 2. 0 m.) which affords better physics performance with lower TF field, and thus lower TF stresses. Bucked and wedged (B&W) TF designs have also been considered. The B&W design results in lower coil stresses in the inner leg {{that may be used}} to increase field or design margin, or alternatively could allow the use of high conductivity OFHC copper which would allow longer pulse lengths.

40|$|Fixturing {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the quality of metal <b>fit-up</b> for sheet metal assembly with laser welding. To reduce the sensitivity of the designed fixture configuration to location fluctuation, this paper provides a quality design of the fixture configuration for sheet metal laser welding. A generic robust design methodology, labeled the two-stage response surface methodology, is developed in the robust design model. The first stage is to find the Robust Design Space (RDS), in which robust solutions with higher degrees of insensitivity reside. Within the RDS, a second-order response surface model can be fitted by a 3 k fractional factorial design in the second stage. Based on the resultant response model, the robust fixturing scheme and the influential design locators can be obtained by an optimization and a statistical screening techniques. The degree of metal <b>fit-up</b> is taken as the performance characteristic of the robust design.

40|$|In {{sheet metal}} {{assembly}} by laser welding, metal <b>fit-up</b> {{is an important}} specification for achieving welding quality. The fixture {{plays an important role}} in satisfying the intimate metal <b>fit-up</b> that laser weld requires. The fixturing quality for sheet metal laser welding is directly related to the assembly weld patterns used (weld location, weld length, etc.). The design of assembly weld patterns is a critical phase in the fixture design cycle. Traditionally, the determination of the weld pattern is based on the designer's experience. Because of this it is quite easy to cause unexpected deviations from the assembly weld quality requirements. In this study, a new computer-aided design approach for the assembly weld pattern is developed, where the sources of variation in the weld areas of the parts are considered in detail. Using this approach, the weld location and the weld length obtained are much more reasonable and cost-justified. A simple example and a case study show that the approach presented for assembly weld pattern design can reasonably meet the fixturing quality requirements. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} support in steel bridges can present {{significant}} challenges during the construction. The tendency of girders to twist or layovers during the construction can present a particularly challenging problem regarding detailing cross-frames that provide bracing to steel girders. Methods of detailing cross-frames have been investigated {{in the past to}} identify some of the issues related to the behavior of straight and skewed steel bridges. However, the absence of a complete and simplified design approach has led to disputes between stakeholders, costly repairs and delays in the construction. The main objective of this research is to develop a complete and simplified design approach considering construction, fabrication and detailing of skewed bridges. This objective is achieved by comparing different detailing methods, understanding the mechanism by which skew effects develop in steel bridges, recommending simplified methods of analysis to evaluate them, and developing a complete and simplified design procedure for skew bridges. Girder layovers, flange lateral bending stress, cross-frame forces, component of vertical deflections, component of vertical reactions and lateral reactions or lateral displacements are affected by detailing methods and are referred as lack-of-fit effects. The main conclusion of this research is that lack-of-fit effects for the Final Fit detailing method at the steel dead load stage are equal and opposite to the lack-of-fit effects for the Erected Fit detailing method at the total dead load stage. This conclusion has helped using 2 D grid analyses for estimating these lack-of-fit effects for different detailing methods. 3 D erection simulations are developed for estimating <b>fit-up</b> forces required to attach the cross-frames to girders. The maximum <b>fit-up</b> force estimated from the 2 D grid analysis shows a reasonable agreement with the one obtained from the erection simulations. The erection sequence that reduces the maximum <b>fit-up</b> force is also found by erection simulations. The line girder analysis is recommended for calculating cambers for the Final Fit detailing method. A combination of line girder analysis and 2 D grid analysis is recommended for calculating cambers for the Erected Fit detailing method. Finally, flowcharts are developed that facilitate the selection of a detailing method and show the necessary design checks...|$|E
40|$|Curved and skewed I-girder bridges exhibit {{torsional}} displacements of {{the individual}} girders and of the overall bridge cross-section under dead loads. As a result, the girder webs can be plumb in only one configuration. If the structure is built such that the webs are plumb in the ideal no-load position, they generally cannot be plumb under {{the action of the}} structure's steel or total dead load; hence, twisting of the girders is unavoidable under dead loads. The deflected geometry resulting from these torsional displacements can impact the <b>fit-up</b> of the members, the erection requirements (crane positions and capacities, the number of temporary supports, tie down requirements, etc.), the bearing cost and type, and the overall strength of the structure. Furthermore, significant layover may be visually objectionable, particularly at piers and abutments. If the torsional deflections are large enough, then the cross-frames are typically detailed to compensate for them, either partially or fully. As specified in Article C 6. 7. 2 of the AASHTO LRFD Specifications, different types of cross-frame detailing methods are used to achieve theoretically plumb webs under the no-load, steel dead load, or total dead load conditions. Each of the cross-frame detailing methods has ramifications on the behavior and constructability of a bridge. Currently, there is much confusion and divergence of opinion in the bridge industry regarding the stage at which steel I girder webs should be ideally plumb and the consequences of out-of-plumbness at other stages. Furthermore, concerns are often raised about potential <b>fit-up</b> problems during steel erection as well as the control of the final deck geometry (e. g., cross-slopes and joint alignment). These influences and ramifications of cross-frame detailing need to be investigated and explained so that resulting field problems leading to needless construction delays and legal claims can be avoided. This dissertation addresses the influence of cross-frame detailing on curved and/or skewed steel I girder bridges during steel erection and concrete deck placement by conducting comprehensive analytical studies. Procedures to determine the lack-of-fit forces due to dead load fit (DLF) detailing are developed {{to assess the impact of}} different types of cross-frame detailing. The studies include benchmarking of refined analytical models against selected full scale experimental tests and field measurements. These analytical models are then utilized to study a variety of practical combinations and permutations of bridge parameters pertaining to horizontal curvature and skew effects. This research develops and clarifies procedures and provides new knowledge with respect to the impact of cross-frame detailing methods on: 1) constructed bridge geometries, 2) cross-frame forces, 3) girder stresses, 4) system strengths, 5) potential uplift at bearings, and 6) <b>fit-up</b> during erection. These developments provide the basis for the development of refined guidelines for: 1) practices to alleviate <b>fit-up</b> difficulties during erection, 2) selection of cross-frame detailing methods as a function of I-girder bridge geometry characteristics, and 3) procedures to calculate the locked-in forces due to DLF cross-frame detailing.

40|$|Internal {{clearance}} in {{rolling element}} bearings is usually present {{to allow for}} radial and axial growth of the rotor-bearing system and to accommodate bearing <b>fit-up.</b> The presence of this clearance also introduces a "dead band" into the load-deflection behavior of the bearing.

In addition, the stiffness of the bearings varies nonlinearly with bearing deflection and with speed. Bearing properties were accurately calculated with a state of the art rolling bearing analysis code. The subsequent rotordynamics analysis shows that for rapid acceleration rates the maximum response amplitude may be less than predicted by steady-state analysis. The presence of clearance may shift the critical speed location to lower speed values.

40|$|This thesis {{undertakes}} a {{study of}} laser welding in terms of basic laser material interaction parameters. This includes power density, interaction time and specific point energy. A detailed study of {{the correlation between the}} laser material interaction parameters and the observed weld bead profiles is carried out. The results show that the power density and the specific point energy control the depth of penetration, whilst the interaction time controls the weld width. These parameters uniquely characterise the response of the material to the imposed laser energy profile, which is independent of the laser system. It is demonstrated that by studying the laser welding with respect to the basic laser material interaction parameters also helps explain some phenomenological phenomena in laser welding, such as the effect of beam diameter on the weld profile. In addition a new approach for parameter selection in laser and hybrid laser welding is investigated. A phenomenological model allowing achievement of a particular laser weld on different laser systems is developed. In the proposed method the user specifies the required weld profile, according to the quality requirements and then the model provides combination of laser parameters, which lead to this particular weld on a given laser system. This approach can be potentially used to transfer laser data between different laser systems with different beam diameters. An extensive study of residual stains in laser and hybrid laser welding is carried out. Both processes are compared either at a constant total heat input or at conditions required to achieve the same depth of penetration. The results demonstrate that there is a trade-off between the <b>fit-up</b> tolerance and the residual stress-induced distortion. Hybrid laser welding provides better ability to bridge gaps than the laser welding, but for the price of increased residual stress and distortion. Additionally, industrial study of the sensitivity to <b>fit-up</b> of hybrid laser welding with high deposition rate MIG sources is carried out. This thesis is a part of NEGLAP (Next Generation Laser Processing) project sponsored by EPSRC (Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council) and Tata Steel. The main objective is to understand the process fundamentals and exploit the usefulness of laser technology in pipe industry. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
