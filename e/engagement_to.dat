However, Solomon's coronation provoked his uncle, Béla, who had until that time held a strong claim to succeed his brother Andrew according to the traditional principle of seniority.

5|$|In December 1811, Maria MacGregor died. At {{a stroke}} MacGregor lost his {{main source of}} income {{and the support of}} the {{influential}} Bowater family.

His only real experience was military, but the manner of his exit from the British Army would make a return there awkward at best.|$|E
