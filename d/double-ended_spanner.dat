40|$|We {{have given}} the {{education}} of manual designing and drafting to the undergraduate students (sophomore, junior, senior) over the twenty years or so. The manual educational program composes of the basic drafting, mechanism-design, material-design, fundamental design-formulae, calculation of numerical design data and its drafting. The basic drafting based on JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard) and/or ISO (International organization for standardization) contains the draftings of lines, symbols, dimensional lines, a <b>double-ended</b> <b>spanner,</b> a worm gear, a plain bearing, a screw jack (with a sketch of it) and so on. The material design includes the choice of best fit materials for the design parts on which various kinds of force work using the JIS material handbooks or others. Students {{should be able to}} use the proper design-formulae for the spacial design parts out of the numerous fundamental formulae to calculate strength and deflection of various machine parts and the mechanical structures referring to design text books and JIS design manuals. The numerical design data based on the proper mechanism should be calculated for each machine part using the these material-design and design-formulas. All of the above mentioned educational programs are also prepared using a personal computer and a 2 -D Mutoh CAD system as a trial by filing the necessary informations in floppy disks. Some efforts are given to use them in the practical education. The comparison and discussion of the both educational programs are given in details in this report...|$|E
