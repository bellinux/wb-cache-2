5|$|When one inhales or exhales, {{according}} to verses 4.47–65, the Nadis {{are loaded with}} vital airs. There are ten types of vital airs, corresponding to different stages of breathing, and they are named Prana, Apana, Samana, Udana, Vyana, Naga, Kurma, Krikara, Devadatta and Dhananjaya. These affect the Nadis in <b>different</b> <b>ways,</b> <b>and</b> how the body functions and what the balance of organs within the body is, depends on food one takes in and how well inhalation and exhalation are able to deliver the vital airs to various body parts.|$|E
5|$|In {{his opinion}} {{all human beings}} have the same {{abilities}} with regard to reason, feelings and imagination, but these basic ingredients are used in <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> <b>and</b> in different environments, which gives rise to different cultures and civilizations. According to him {{it is obvious that}} the culture on Tierra del Fuego is at a lower level of development than European culture, but he also admits that the conditions of life there are much more difficult and this gives people very little chance to develop a higher culture. Based on these opinions he was classified as one of the main examples of 18th-century German cosmopolitanism.|$|E

5|$|Volcanic {{ash fall}} is physically, socially, and {{economically}} disruptive. Volcanic ash can affect both proximal areas and areas {{many hundreds of}} kilometres from the source, and causes disruptions and losses {{in a wide variety}} of different infrastructure sectors. Impacts are dependent on: ash fall thickness; the duration of the ash fall; the grain size and chemistry of the ash; whether the ash is wet or dry; and any preparedness, management and prevention (mitigation) measures employed to reduce effects from the ash fall. Different sectors of infrastructure and society are affected in <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> <b>and</b> are vulnerable to a range of impacts or consequences. These are discussed in the following sections.|$|E

25|$|Carriers of A-T, such as {{the parents}} of a person with A-T, have one mutated copy of the ATM gene and one normal copy.

This finding has been confirmed in a variety of <b>different</b> <b>ways,</b> <b>and</b> is the subject of current research. Standard surveillance (including monthly breast self-exams and mammography at the usual schedule for age) is recommended, unless additional tests are indicated because the individual has other risk factors (e.g., family history of breast cancer).|$|E
25|$|The OPERA team {{analyzed}} {{the results in}} <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> <b>and</b> using different experimental methods. Following the initial main analysis released in September, three further analyses were made public in November. In the main November analysis, all the existing data were reanalyzed to allow adjustments for other factors, such as the Sagnac effect in which the Earth's rotation affects the distance traveled by the neutrinos. Then an alternative analysis adopted a different model for the matching of the neutrinos to their creation time. The third analysis of November focused on a different experimental setup ('the rerun') which changed the way the neutrinos were created.|$|E

In addition, C-PTSD is not a personality disorder – rather it is often a case of survival reactions to trauma becoming a fundamental aspect of the personality, in response to living with a personality disordered individual.|$|E

25|$|The {{most notable}} {{appearance}} of the chariot in Greek mythology occurs when Phaëton, the son of Helios, {{in an attempt to}} drive the chariot of the sun, managed to set the earth on fire. This story led to the archaic meaning of a phaeton as one who drives a chariot or coach, especially at a reckless or dangerous speed. Plato, in his Chariot Allegory, depicted a chariot drawn by two horses, one well behaved and the other troublesome, representing opposite impulses of human nature; the task of the charioteer, representing reason, was to stop the horses from going <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> <b>and</b> to guide them towards enlightenment.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have found}} that females tend to think more about their body shape and endorse thinner figures than men even into old age. When female {{undergraduates}} were exposed to depictions of thin women their body satisfaction decreased, but rose when exposed to larger models. In addition, many women engage in fat talk (speaking negatively about the weight-related size/shape of one's body), a behavior that {{has been associated with}} weight dissatisfaction, body surveillance, and body shame. In addition, women who overhear others using fat talk may also experience an increase in body dissatisfaction and guilt. As a result, women may experience concerns related to body image in a number of <b>different</b> <b>ways</b> <b>and</b> from a variety of sources.|$|E
25|$|The color {{variations}} in the mimicked substrate and animal skin are similar. Depending on the species, the skin of cuttlefish responds to substrate changes in distinctive ways. By changing naturalistic backgrounds, the camouflage responses of different species can be measured. Sepia officinalis changes color to match the substrate by disruptive patterning (contrast {{to break up the}} outline), where as S. pharanonis matches the substrate by blending in. Although camouflage is achieved in <b>different</b> <b>ways,</b> <b>and</b> in an absence of color vision, both species change their skin colors to match the substrate. Cuttlefish adapt their own camouflage pattern in ways that are specific for a particular habitat. An animal could settle in the sand and appear one way, with another animal a few feet away in a slightly different microhabitat, settled in algae for example, will be camouflaged quite differently.|$|E
