5|$|After {{directing}} {{and writing}} for the stage in New York, Rossen moved to Hollywood in 1937.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, working in Hanford and Savannah River Sites, Reines and Cowan {{developed}} {{the equipment and}} procedures with which they first detected the supposedly undetectable neutrinos in June 1956. Reines dedicated the major part of <b>his</b> <b>career</b> <b>to</b> {{the study of the}} neutrino's properties and interactions, which work would influence study of the neutrino for many researchers to come. This included the detection of neutrinos created in the atmosphere by cosmic rays, and the 1987 detection of neutrinos emitted from Supernova SN1987A, which inaugurated the field of neutrino astronomy.|$|E

5|$|Today, player–managers {{have become}} rare in baseball. Pete Rose {{is the most}} recent player–manager, serving from 1984 through 1986 with the Cincinnati Reds. Whereas some player–managers, such as Lou Boudreau, were {{full-time}} players as player–managers, by the time Rose became player–manager, he was a part-time player. Rose was trying to prolong <b>his</b> <b>career</b> <b>to</b> break the all-time hit record set by Ty Cobb, and Reds owner Marge Schott used this as a marketing ploy. Rose removed himself from the 40-man roster after the 1986 season {{to make room for}} Pat Pacillo, unofficially retiring as a player, but remained as the Reds manager until he was banned from baseball following the release of the Dowd Report in 1989.|$|E

Partnering Leonardo Mayer, del Potro lost in doubles against Ivan Dodig and Marin Cilic. 2–1 down in matches, del Potro played in singles against Cilic, coming back from 2 sets down {{for the first time}} in <b>his</b> <b>career</b> <b>to</b> win in five sets. Described as one of the best Davis Cup comebacks ever, del Potro {{levelled}} the score at 2–2, paving the way for Federico Delbonis to complete the comeback by beating Ivo Karlović in straight sets, thus claiming Argentina's first ever Davis Cup title.|$|E

5|$|Although Barber did {{not play}} any more Tests, his scoring was {{consistent}} in the four seasons up until World War II. In all but 1936 (he scored 993 runs that year), he scored around 1,500 runs and in all but 1938 (he averaged just under 34), he averaged between 36 and 38. He was second in the Yorkshire batting averages in 1936, fourth in 1937 and 1939 but slipped to sixth in 1938. Following the war, Barber played one more full season, scoring 1,170 runs {{at an average of}} 30.00 in 1946 to be fourth in the Yorkshire averages. It was the eighth and final time he passed 1,000 runs in a season. During these seasons, Barber's runs contributed to Yorkshire being County Champions in four consecutive seasons from 1937 to 1939 and then again after the war in 1946. He played a further three matches in 1947 to bring <b>his</b> <b>career</b> <b>to</b> a close. From 1932, when Barber became a regular player, until his last full season in 1946, he was part of a Championship winning side seven times.|$|E
5|$|During {{his life}} Etty had {{acquired}} followers such as Irish painters William Mulready and Daniel Maclise, but both rejected Etty's preoccupation with nudes. Mulready painted nudes but became {{best known for}} domestic genre paintings, while Maclise chose to specialise in more traditional history paintings and exhibited only one nude work in his career. One of the few painters who consciously attempted to continue Etty's style after his death was William Edward Frost, who had been an acquaintance of Etty's since 1825. In the early 1830s Frost painted on commission for Thomas Potts (whose 1833 commission of Etty to paint his daughter Elizabeth's portrait had been Etty's first significant portrait commission), and later was commissioned on Etty's recommendation to paint a portrait of Etty's cousin Thomas Bodley. Frost successfully imitated Etty throughout <b>his</b> <b>career,</b> <b>to</b> the extent that his figure studies and Etty's are often misattributed to each other. Although Frost eventually became a Royal Academician in 1870, by this time Etty's style of painting had badly fallen out of fashion.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1980s and early 1990s, Bean became an {{established}} actor on British television. He {{appeared in the}} BBC productions Clarissa and Lady Chatterley (1993) with Joely Richardson. In 1990, Bean starred in Jim Sheridan's adaption of the John B. Keane play The Field. Also in 1990, {{his role as the}} journalist Anton in Windprints examined the difficult problems of apartheid in South Africa. In 1996, he combined his love of football with <b>his</b> <b>career</b> <b>to</b> finally achieve his childhood dream of playing for Sheffield United, as Jimmy Muir in the film When Saturday Comes. Although the film was not critically acclaimed, Bean received credit for a good performance. In August 1997, Bean appeared in what became a famous Sky Sports commercial for the upcoming 1997–98 Premier League season. His football related work continued in 1998 when he narrated La Coupe de la Gloire, the official film of the 1998 FIFA World Cup held in France.|$|E

5|$|Equally, Gaudí {{stood out}} as {{interior}} decorator, decorating {{most of his}} buildings personally, from the furnishings to the smallest details. In each case {{he knew how to}} apply stylistic particularities, personalising the decoration according to the owner's taste, the predominant style of the arrangement or its place in the surroundings—whether urban or natural, secular or religious. Many of his works were related to liturgical furnishing. From the design of a desk for his office at the beginning of <b>his</b> <b>career</b> <b>to</b> the furnishings designed for the Sobrellano Palace of Comillas, he designed all furnishing of the Vicens, Calvet, Batlló and Milà houses, of the Güell Palace and the Bellesguard Tower, and the liturgical furnishing of the Sagrada Família. It is noteworthy that Gaudí studied some ergonomy in order to adapt his furnishings to human anatomy. Many of his furnishings are exhibited at Gaudi House Museum.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1960s Terry-Thomas began {{appearing}} in American films, coarsening his already unsubtle screen character in {{films such as}} Bachelor Flat, It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and How to Murder Your Wife. From the mid-1960s he frequently starred in European films, in roles such as Sir Reginald in the successful French film La Grande Vadrouille. In 1971 Terry-Thomas was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, which slowly brought <b>his</b> <b>career</b> <b>to</b> a conclusion: his last film role was in 1980. He {{spent much of his}} fortune on medical treatment and, shortly before his death, was living in poverty, existing on charity from the Actors' Benevolent Fund. A charity gala was held in his honour, which raised sufficient funds for him to live his remaining time in a nursing home.|$|E
5|$|In 1954–55 England toured Australia {{for five}} Ashes Tests. Davidson started his season well, scoring 30 and 27 not out {{and taking a}} total of 5/104 as New South Wales drew with England. His victims {{included}} leading batsmen Colin Cowdrey and Bill Edrich. However, Davidson succumbed to injury and missed Australia's only win of the series in the First Test, and upon his return in the Second Test, managed match figures of 2/86 and did not pass twenty in either innings as England levelled the series. He was dropped for the Third Test, but continued to perform strongly in domestic matches, including a sequence of 19 wickets in three matches. This included 4/45 including the wickets of Compton, Bailey and Graveney in a tour match against England, and a match-winning performance against arch-rivals Victoria that sealed a second successive Shield triumph with a resounding nine-wicket win in two days. He tore through the Victorians with 5/36 and 4/50, removing Harvey and Test all rounder Sam Loxton twice. It was his best match bowling figures in <b>his</b> <b>career</b> <b>to</b> date.|$|E
