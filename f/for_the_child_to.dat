25|$|Along {{with gender}} equality, {{the issue of}} {{parenting}} under the communal way of life was a concern. The parental tendency is to view the child as a personal possession and to dominate them. The founding members of the kibbutz agreed {{that this was not}} conducive to community life. They also thought it was selfish of parents to want to control their children and that this did not give room <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> grow as their own person.|$|E

Instead, {{they may be}} selected to include particular sounds, tones, or radicals; to balance the Chinese elements of a child's birth chart; or to honor a generation poem handed down through the family for centuries. Traditionally, it is considered an affront and not an honor to have a newborn named after an older relative, so that full names are rarely passed down through a family {{in the manner of}} American English Seniors, Juniors, III, etc. Similarly, it is considered disadvantageous <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> bear a name already made famous by someone else, although Romanizations might be identical or a common name like Liu Xiang might be borne by tens of thousands.|$|E
25|$|The pentatonic scale plays a {{significant}} role in music education, particularly in Orff-based, Kodály-based, and Waldorf methodologies at the primary or elementary level. The Orff system places a heavy emphasis on developing creativity through improvisation in children, largely through use of the pentatonic scale. Orff instruments, such as xylophones, bells and other metallophones, use wooden bars, metal bars or bells, which can be removed by the teacher, leaving only those corresponding to the pentatonic scale, which Carl Orff himself believed to be children's native tonality. Children begin improvising using only these bars, and over time, more bars are added at the teacher's discretion until the complete diatonic scale is being used. Orff believed that the use of the pentatonic scale {{at such a young age}} was appropriate to the development of each child, since the nature of the scale meant that it was impossible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> make any real harmonic mistakes.|$|E

25|$|Sibling’s {{influence}} is often {{most effective when}} the sibling is of an age that is more advanced than the child himself, therefore increasing the motivation <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> model after their brother or sister. The impact of older siblings are power predictors for the younger sibling’s gender role attitudes, sex-typed personality qualities, and masculine leisure activities. Findings suggest that girls develop less traditional attitudes than boys, thus, relative to stereotypically traditional development, older male siblings are more conscientious towards masculine activities, which are evidently modeled after by younger siblings more than feminine activities. Moreover, older brothers tend to have stronger influence over a younger sibling’s sexual development. There {{is evidence that the}} relationship between older brother and younger sister can, in fact, influence the sister to become more feminine, abiding to more stereotypical gender-typed development than girls with older sisters. Interestingly, biological studies show that dizygotic twins with the opposite- sex co-twin gender show more sex-typed behaviors than same-sex twins.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} regarding EEC {{syndrome is}} focused on the genetic components contributing to the presented traits found in patients with EEC. A normal human karyotype includes 22 pairs of autosomal or non-sex chromosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes, constituting a total of 46 chromosomes. During reproduction, each parent contributes 23 chromosomes; 22 autosomal chromosomes and one sex chromosome. As stated above, EEC syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder. This means that there is an abnormal gene on one of the autosomal (non-sex) chromosomes from either parent. Because the gene is dominant, only one parent must contribute the abnormal gene <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> inherit the disease and the contributing parent will usually have the disease, due to the expression of the dominant gene in the parent. Some characteristics of autosomal dominant inheritance patterns include a vertical transmission pattern, meaning that the disease phenotype is seen in generation after generation. Also, the recurrence risk is 50% and there are an equal number of affected males and females. Though we can calculate the chance of inheritance of the gene, the degree of expression cannot be calculated.|$|E
25|$|Developed by Gertrude Orff at the Kindezentrum München, {{is another}} {{approach}} known as Orff Music Therapy. Both the clinical setting of social pediatrics {{as well as}} the Orff Schulwerk (schoolwork) approach in music education (developed by German composer Carl Orff) influence this method, which is used with children with developmental problems, delays and disabilities. The area of social pediatrics was developed after the Second World War in Germany by Theodor Hellbrügge, who understood that medicine alone could not meet the complex needs of developmentally disabled children. He consulted psychologists, occupational therapists and other mental healthcare professionals whose knowledge and skills could aid in the diagnostics and treatment of children. Gertrude Orff was asked to develop a form of therapy based on the Orff Schulwerk approach to support the emotional development of patients. Elements found in both the music therapy and education approaches include the understanding of holistic music presentation as involving word, sound and movement; the use of both music and play improvisation as providing a creative stimulus <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> investigate and explore; Orff instrumentation, including keyboard instruments and percussion instruments as a means of participation and interaction in a therapeutic setting; and lastly, the multisensory aspects of music used by the therapist to meet the particular needs of the child, such as both feeling and hearing sound.|$|E

500|$|There {{has been}} a major shift which is favoring joint custody in the United States court system, which began in the mid-1980s.

500|$|Children {{generally}} {{remained in}} the direct care of their mothers {{until the age of}} about eight years old, after which time it was not uncommon <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> be placed in the foster care of another family. There were any number of reasons for a child to be [...] "put-out" [...] in this manner. Some children were placed into households to learn a trade, others to be taught to read and write. It seems that there was a theological reason for fostering children, as with almost every decision in the colony. It was assumed that children's own parents would love them too much and would not properly discipline them. By placing children in the care of another family, there was little danger of them being spoiled.|$|E
500|$|In May 1670, {{with the}} death of Grand Duke Ferdinando II, Marguerite Louise became Grand Duchess of Tuscany. The old {{tradition}} of admitting the reigning Grand Duke's mother to the Consulta, or Privy Council, was reinstituted at Cosimo III's accession. Loathing Marguerite Louise for her treatment of Cosimo and herself, Vittoria della Rovere, Cosimo III's mother, ensured that Marguerite Louise was denied membership of the Consulta. Being thus effectively excluded from politics, she was left with nothing else to do but supervise the education of her son the Grand Prince Ferdinando. The Grand Duchess, furious at her exclusion, fought with Vittoria over precedence and demanded entry to the Consulta. Cosimo III sided with his mother. Presumably yet another reconciliation, however brief, took place in the summer of 1670, of which a sign was the birth of the couple's last child, Gian Gastone on 24 May 1671. However, by early 1671, the fighting between Marguerite Louise and Vittoria became so heated that a contemporary remarked that [...] "the Pitti Palace has become the devil's own abode, and from morn till midnight only the noise of wrangling and abuse can be heard". The birth of Gian Gastone on the first anniversary of his grandfather Ferdinando II's death, gave an occasion <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> receive the name of his other, maternal grandfather, Gaston, Duke of Orléans, who had died in 1660. He was later to be the last Medici Grand Duke of Tuscany.|$|E

2500|$|The {{environment}} a child {{develops in}} has influences on language development. The environment provides language input <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> process. Speech by adults to children help provide {{the child with}} correct language usage repetitively. Environmental influences on language development are explored {{in the tradition of}} social interactionist theory by such researchers as Jerome Bruner, Alison Gopnik, Andrew Meltzoff, Anat Ninio, Roy Pea, Catherine Snow, Ernest Moerk and Michael Tomasello. Jerome Bruner who laid the foundations of this approach in the 1970s, emphasized that adult [...] "scaffolding" [...] of the child's attempts to master linguistic communication {{is an important factor in}} the developmental process.|$|E
2500|$|ANRs {{have also}} been {{employed}} in cases where a mother may desire to breastfeed her child, but has to find an alternative to inducing lactation. [...] She may have difficulty beginning lactation, so she supplements the infant's suckling {{with that of a}} partner. [...] Or there are cases where breastfeeding was interrupted {{for an extended period of}} time as a result of infant prematurity, infant absence, or mother's illness (taking prescription medication). In such cases, adult nursing has often caused lactation to continue until it was possible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> resume breastfeeding. Others may want to nurse an adopted child, so use an ANR to stimulate breast milk production before the adoption occurs. [...] Though such scenarios do not have erotic motivations, erotic expression may be an additional aspect of the relationship.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] empiricist theory suggests, contra Chomsky, {{that there}} is enough {{information}} in the linguistic input children receive and therefore, {{there is no need}} to assume an innate language acquisition device exists (see above). Rather than a LAD evolved specifically for language, empiricists believe that general brain processes are sufficient enough for language acquisition. During this process, it is necessary <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>to</b> actively engage with their environment. For a child to learn language, the parent or caregiver adopts a particular way of appropriately communicating with the child; this is known as child-directed speech (CDS). CDS is used so that children are given the necessary linguistic information needed for their language. Empiricism is a general approach and sometimes goes along with the interactionist approach. Statistical language acquisition, which falls under empiricist theory, suggests that infants acquire language by means of pattern perception.|$|E
