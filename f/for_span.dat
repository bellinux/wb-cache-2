50|$|Most {{wrapping}} machine designs carry a single drum of cable {{on one side}} of the machine and therefore require a counterweight on the opposite side to provide lateral stability. As a minimum, the counterweight is adjustable at each pole or tower to reflect the reduced weight of the payload at the end of each span. The more sophisticated designs of {{wrapping machine}}s have automatically adjusting counterweights that maintain balance throughout the span as the cable drum becomes progressively lighter. This is normally achieved by arranging for the counterweight move inwards towards the machine axis as the machine travels forward. Such devices are essential <b>for</b> <b>span</b> lengths greater than 250 - 300m. Ideally, the centre of gravity of the rotating part of the wrapping machine should lie on the axis of the host conductor at all times. The centre of gravity of the complete wrapping machine will always be below the axis of the host conductor.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{emulsification}} {{technique has}} been developed for high throughput production of uniform emulsion droplets using high porosity oscillating stainless steel wire woven micro-screen. Different surfactants were investigated including dispersed/continuous bi-surfactant systems using Span 80 /SDS and Span 80 /Tween 20. The effects of oscillation amplitude and frequency {{as well as the}} dispersed phase flux on emulsion average droplet size and uniformity were investigated. It was found that the droplet average size decreased with increasing the surface sheer stress. The emulsion droplet uniformity determined using the coefficient of variation (CV) changed with oscillations such that there was an optimal oscillating frequency for each amplitude where the CV was smallest. Furthermore, it was also found that both droplet size and uniformity were influenced by the content of surfactants and that the effect of process conditions was stronger <b>for</b> <b>Span</b> 80 /SDS system than <b>for</b> <b>Span</b> 80 /Tween 20 system. The experimental data were fitted satisfactorily using shear stress function with R 2 value of 0. 97. Inserts were used to narrow the width of the continuous phase container and to build geometric channels. The flat surface inserts, the wavy surface inserts and the inserts with baffles have been studied. The results show that the droplet size decreased and the size distribution was widened.

The purpose of research is to analyze the suitability of spans from open double T beams for floating bridges with minimum weight under loads, which is provided by standards for modern floating bridges designing. Methodology. Comparative method, analytical calculation methods (influence lines methodology), strength calculations, endurance, maximum shear stress are used in this paper. Findings. Current loads for bridges calculations are 75 % more than those, <b>for</b> which the <b>spans</b> of floating bridge from NZhM- 56 property are designed. The use of open double T beams that is formed with double T beam no. 70 (the height of the open one is 104 cm) reduces the cross sectional area in a weakened spot, but virtually it does not influence the strength and durability of the material. The use of open double T beams <b>for</b> <b>spans</b> of floating bridges saves up to 22 % of metal that means one in five spans will made of saved metal. Savings on each spans, such as CRP, will be 33. 6 - 263 thous. grn. (considering the price of 1 ton of final product 29 thous. grn.). Originality.
