40|$|Background: Not all the {{techniques}} for the correct use of metered dose inhalers {{are used by}} patients and health care professionals. Aim: To assess {{the techniques}} and errors {{in the use of}} metered dose inhalers among patients and health care professionals. Material and methods: Evaluation of the <b>inhaling</b> <b>technique,</b> using a validated questionnaire, used by 68 patients, 30 physicians and 30 nurses working in a hospital at Concepción, Chile. Results: The "closed mouth" technique is used by 84 % of patients, 40 % of physicians and 73 % of nurses. The rest uses the "open mouth" technique. The aerochamber is used by 12 % of patients, 37 % of physicians and 27 % of nurses. The most frequent inhaling errors detected were not shaking the inhaler (26 % of patients, 30 % of physicians and 7 % of nurses), not applying the puff at the start of inspiration (28 % of patients, 7 % of physicians and 13 % of nurses), and not maintaining an apnea after the inhalation (41 % of patients, 7 % of physicians and 10 % of nurses). Sixty percent of patients, 67 % of physicians and 40 % of nurses have not received instructions about the inhaler use. Conclusions: There is a high frequency of errors in the use of inhalers and most users have not been trained in its use. (Rev Méd Chile 2001; 129 : 413 - 20...|$|E

All health care professionals who care for COPD patients should have full access to high-quality spirometry testing, as postbronchodilator spirometry constitutes the principal method of COPD diagnosis. One out of four smokers 45 years or older presenting respiratory symptoms in primary care, have non-fully reversible airflow limitation compatible with COPD and are mostly without a known diagnosis. Approximately 50. 0 %– 98. 3 % of patients are undiagnosed worldwide. The majority of undiagnosed COPD patients are isolated at home, are in nursing or senior-assisted living facilities, or are present in oncology and cardiology clinics as patients with lung cancers and coronary artery disease. At this time, the prevalence and mortality of COPD subjects is increasing, rapidly among women who {{are more susceptible to}} risk factors. Since effective management strategies are currently available for all phenotypes of COPD, correctly performed and well-interpreted postbronchodilator spirometry is still an essential component of all approaches used. Simple educational training can substantially improve physicians’ knowledge relating to COPD diagnosis. Similarly, a physician inhaler education program can improve attitudes toward inhaler teaching and facilitate its implementation in routine clinical practices. Spirometry combined with <b>inhaled</b> <b>technique</b> education improves the ability of predominantly nonrespiratory physicians to correctly diagnose COPD, to adequately assess its severity, and to increase the percentage of correct COPD treatment used in a real-life setting.

40|$|Abstract Background Low {{therapeutic}} {{adherence to}} medication is very common. Clinical effectiveness {{is related to}} dose rate and route of administration and so poor therapeutic adherence can reduce the clinical benefit of treatment. The therapeutic adherence of patients with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) is extremely poor according to most studies. The research about COPD adherence has mainly focussed on quantifying its effect, and few studies have researched factors that affect non-adherence. Our study will evaluate the effectiveness of a multifactor intervention to improve the therapeutic adherence of COPD patients. Methods/Design A randomized controlled clinical trial with 140 COPD diagnosed patients selected by a non-probabilistic method of sampling. Subjects will be randomly allocated into two groups, using the block randomization technique. Every patient in each group will be visited four times during the year of the study. Intervention: Motivational aspects related to adherence (beliefs and behaviour) : group and individual interviews; cognitive aspects: information about illness; skills: <b>inhaled</b> <b>technique</b> training. Reinforcement of the cognitive-emotional aspects and <b>inhaled</b> <b>technique</b> training will be carried out in all visits of the intervention group. Discussion Adherence to a prescribed treatment involves a behavioural change. Cognitive, emotional and motivational aspects influence this change and so we consider the best intervention procedure to improve adherence would be a cognitive and emotional strategy which could be applied in daily clinical practice. Our hypothesis is that the application of a multifactor intervention (COPD information, dose reminders and reinforcing audiovisual material, motivational aspects and inhalation technique training) to COPD patients taking inhaled treatment will give a 25 % {{increase in the number of}} patients showing therapeutic adherence in this group compared to the control group. We will evaluate the effectiveness of this multifactor intervention on patient adherence to inhaled drugs considering that it will be right and feasible to the clinical practice context.

40|$|Difficult asthma which {{constitutes}} {{less than}} 5 % of all childhood asthma cases {{is defined as}} presence of daily symptoms, frequent oral corticosteroid requirement and frequent exacerbations for longer than six months, despite the use of inhaled steroid equivalent to 500 mcg fluticasone propionate, long acting beta 2 agonist or theophylline and leukotriene antagonists. Difficult asthma is not expected in childhood due {{to the absence of}} remodelling, rapid restoration of the airway, use of efficacious <b>inhaled</b> <b>techniques</b> and steroids and absence of occupational exposures. Therefore, it may be thought that “pediatric difficult asthma” is a differential diagnosis and treatment adherence problem. It has been shown that difficult asthma cases that have been filtered from this aspect have a non-eosinophilic inflammatory phenotype characterized by defective beta 2 receptor responses and high steroid resistance. Increased thickness of the basal membrane supports the view that dysfunctional mechanisms play a more important role than inflammatory mechanisms. Environmental control and elimination of risk factors should be achieved in these cases and proper education for treatment modalities and inhalation techniques need to be provided.

40|$|Objectives/Hypothesis. Inhaling {{singing is}} a {{recently}} developed singing technique explored by the soprano singer Francoise Vanhecke. It {{is based on}} an inspiratory airflow instead of an expiratory airflow. This article describes the anatomical structural differences of the vocal tract between inhaling and exhaling singing. We hypothesize that the vocal tract alters significantly in inhaling singing, especially concerning the configuration of the anatomical structures in the oral cavity and the subglottal region. Study Design. This is a prospective study. Methods. A professional singer (F. V.) performed sustained tones from F 5 chromatically rising up to Bb 5 on the vowel /a/. Vocal tract anatomy is assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Results. Wilcoxon directional testing demonstrates (1) that the vocal tract volume above the glottal region does not differ statistically in contrast to the subglottal region and (2) significant changes in the configuration of the tongue, the upright position of the epiglottis, the length of the floor of mouth, and the distance between the teeth. Conclusions. The narrowing of the subglottis is considered to be secondary to suction forces used in the <b>inhaling</b> singing <b>technique.</b> The changes in the anatomical structures above the vocal folds possibly suggest a valve-like function controlling the air inlet together with the regulator function of the resonator capacities of the vocal tract...|$|R

Six smokers, six ex-smokers, and three non-smokers (12 men and three women, median age 60 years) were studied. Eight subjects had chronic obstructive lung disease (median FEV 1 46 % predicted) and seven had asthma (FEV 1 70 % predicted). Seven subjects produced sputum regularly, two of whom had asthma. Clearance of secretions was measured by an <b>inhaled</b> radioaerosol <b>technique.</b> The number of coughs and the wet weight, radioactive content, and mean apparent viscosity of sputum produced during the six hour observation period were recorded, as was the mean wet weight of sputum produced during the last two 24 hour periods ending each treatment. Comparison with placebo showed that treatment with high dose ipratropium bromide was associ-ated with {{a significant increase in the}} penetration index of inhaled particles, but there was no significant change in alveolar deposition of particles or in tracheobronchial clearance, uncorrected or corrected for sputum expectorated.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of uncontrolled and controlled asthma, and the {{factors associated with}} uncontrolled asthma were investigated in a cross-sectional study. Patients aged 11 years with confirmed asthma diagnosis were recruited from the outpatient asthma clinic of Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, Brazil. Patients were excluded if they had other chronic pulmonary disease. They underwent an evaluation by a general questionnaire, an asthma control questionnaire (based on the 2006 Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines), assessment of <b>inhaled</b> device <b>technique</b> and pulmonary function tests. Asthma was controlled in 48 of 275 patients (17. 5 %), partly controlled in 74 (26. 9 %) and uncontrolled in 153 (55. 6 %). In the univariate analysis, asthma severity was associated with asthma control (P < 0. 001). Availability of asthma medications was associated with asthma control (P = 0. 01), so that most patients who could purchase medications had controlled asthma, while patients who depend on the public health system for access to medications had lower rates of controlled asthma. The use of inhaled corticosteroid was lower in the uncontrolled group (P < 0. 001). Logistic regression analysis identified three factors associated with uncontrolled asthma: severity of asthma (OR = 5. 33, P < 0. 0001), access to medications (OR = 1. 97, P = 0. 025) and use of inhaled corticosteroids (OR = 0. 17, P = 0. 030).

40|$|Incorrect <b>inhaled</b> drug {{delivery}} <b>technique</b> {{is a common}} problem in paediatric asthma [1 - 4]. Previously, device technique training {{has been shown to}} significantly improve inhaler skills, using subjective methods, namely check-list analysis [5 - 8]. However, more objective measures are needed to examine more comprehensively the effect of training in preschool children and parents. Resistance to regular asthma therapy is also a frequent problem when attempting to treat young children. Reasoning with young children can be very difficult and parents often have to struggle with their child to achieve compliance [2]. The Funhaler spacer (FH) (Funhaler™; InfaMed, Australia) has been developed in an attempt to resolve this issue by incorporating incentive toys to distract the child from the {{drug delivery}} process. Based on parental questiom 1 aire, the FH has been shown to improve inhalation technique and increase medication compliance in young children over a two-week period [1]. A total of 47 children participated in the present study; 24 were randomised to a standard Aerochamber plus spacer (AC+) (15 male, mean age 63. 7 months, range 30 - 90 months), and 23 were randomised to the FH spacer (14 male, mean age 60. 5 months, range 36 - 90 months). Of the 47, four children (AC+: n= 2, FH: n= 2), {{with a mean age of}} 51 months (36 - 60 months) were identified as nose breathers, and were analysed as a separate group. The results from the present study show that repeated clinic-based technique training had no significant effect on drug delivery (p= 0. l 51). Furthermore, it was found that in the clinic setting, children who were using the FH spacer were more likely to 2 ̆ 7 play up 2 ̆ 7 during the drug administration procedure, compared to children using the AC+ spacer. This was also reflected in the domiciliary setting, where children who were using the AC+ spacer exhibited significantly higher drug delivery consistently over the seven days, compared to the FH spacer group (p= 0. 032). In addition, the in vitro data showed that drug delivery was significantly dependent on age, height, weight and breathing parameters (peak inhalation flow, tidal volume, inhalation volume, exhalation volume, peak exhalation flow) with the AC+ spacer; however this was not seen with the FH spacer. Although it was expected that dependence on parameters such as inspiratory volume would affect day-to-day drug dose, it was found that drug delivery was actually better in the home setting with the AC+ spacer than the FH spacer. Therefore, these findings suggest that children interact better with a standard spacer device, such as the AC+, compared to the incentive FH spacer...|$|R
