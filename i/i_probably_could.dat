5000|$|Thornton began {{painting}} as a teenager, during [...] "a period of Minimalism moving into Conceptualism." [...] She recalls that lineage as a prominent {{part of her}} own work, where visually, [...] "The paintings were moving towards white but {{there was some kind}} of grid that kept being laid down and re-established." [...] Scholar Thomas Zummer characterizes those early paintings through their grids: [...] "Thornton's paintings organized a sensual, expressionist hand into strict formal geometric mappings. These works begin with a painterly sensuality set within and against a series of structural grids, so that there is a constant between expressivity and the ineffable." [...] But as her practice developed, he notes, [...] "Painting was a vessel incapable of the containment of the sensate. Language, gesture, emotion the random and inexplicable things and occurrences of the world were among her subjects; painting seemed insufficient. It was a matter of finding an appropriate instrument for her investigations". Painting's insufficiency led Thornton to her first venture in filmmaking, X-TRACTS, in 1975 while studying painting at the Hartford School of Art (though she was familiar with film theory from her undergraduate coursework at SUNY-Buffalo). After graduating, she abandoned painting in favor of filmmaking, which felt to her, despite Zummer's claims, entirely unrelated to her previous practice: [...] "I dropped thinking of what I had been doing with painting once I started the process of making film. I didn't draw comparisons though <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>could</b> now, if I thought about it." [...] Filmmaking has dominated her work since this transition, though she recently began painting again as a hobby.|$|E

July 25, 1959 Mr. Richard Gosser International Vice President UAW-CIO 425 winthrop street Toledo, Ohio Dear Dick: This letter {{will contain}} {{information}} that I related to Ned Skeldon {{a few moments}} ago; lim sending it along so that you'll have it in writing, first-hand. In talking to {{some of my friends}} on the McClellan Committee staff, I learned that the subpoena which has been issued for your appearance and that of some of the other representativesof Local 12, is strictly the product of Republican partisanshipand is a pure and simple case of trying to smear you and some of the Democrats with whom the UAW has been friendly. The McClellan Committee itself, as a group, does not determine who is to be subpoenaed or called to appear before the Committee. Any member of the McClellan Committee, accord­ing to what I was told, has the right to request the issuance of a subpoena for anyone that the member wants to bring before the Committee for interrogation. Needless to say, this is a very different procedure than we have in the House. Here it takes the action of the entire Committee to subpoena witnesses. Although McClellan has acquiesced in the above procedure,he has insisted that information with respect to a subpoenaedwitness be presented to the entire Committee before a hearingis actually scheduled. I was told that Goldwater, Mundt, or whoever insisted on subpoenaing you and the others has declined thus far to furnish the Committee with any information. As a result, McClellan has refused to set a definite date for the hearings [...] postponing the hearing scheduled for next Mondayuntil August 4. I was told that he almost certainly would postpone it again unless the Committee is informed of the information upon which the subpoena was issued. The one thing that was most encouraging to me, Dick, was the outspoken antagonism of the Committee staff againstthe Republican members of the Committee who have insisted upon subpoenaing you. The staff members recognize that any information against you is of sufficiently old vintage that the charges are flat and that the only possible purpose can be to try to embarrass a few Democratic labor leaders [...] for a change. I was told that I would be kept informed on the situation and that <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>could</b> find out in advance just what infor­mation will be developed in the event that you actually are forced to come to Washington. I was hope ful that I'd {{be able to get the}} Committee to tear up the subpoenas but this does not appear to be possible,the reason being that I don't stand a hell of a lot better with Goldwater or Mundt than you do. At any rate, that's the situ­ation. This takes best wishes. Sincerely yours, Thomas Ashley, M. C. TLA:kl...|$|E
