25|$|Texas Instruments v. Sprague: On April 10, 1962, Lehovec {{received}} a patent for isolation by p-n junction. Texas Instruments immediately filed {{a court case}} claiming that the isolation problem was solved in their <b>earlier</b> <b>patent</b> filed by Kilby. Robert Sprague, the founder of Sprague, considered the case hopeless {{and was going to}} give up the patent rights, was convinced otherwise by Lehovec. Four years later, Texas Instruments hosted in Dallas an arbitration hearing with demonstrations of the Kilby's inventions and depositions by experts. However, Lehovec conclusively proved that Kilby did not mention isolation of components. His priority on the isolation patent was finally acknowledged in April 1966.|$|E
25|$|Despite his {{pioneering}} work with gas Murdoch {{never made any}} money from this invention due to his failure to obtain a patent. This may have been partly {{a result of the}} advice of James Watt, Junior, that the discovery was not patentable, and partly a result of the commercial failure of his <b>earlier</b> <b>patent</b> of 1791 for an early form of aniline dye. This failure to apply for a patent, despite the commercial participation of Boulton and Watt in this field, left the fledgling industry of gas production and lighting open for exploitation by other commercial interests, such as his former assistant Samuel Clegg and Frederick Albert Winsor. In large part this was due to the failure of Boulton and Watt to make sufficient effort to expand from the factory and mill lighting market which they dominated by 1809 into the street and domestic lighting market. This reason for this lassitude is unknown but can be attributed to lack of interest, a failure to appreciate the size of the potential market, and a lack of desire to be involved in smaller, less prestigious projects. By May 1809 Boulton and Watt faced little competition in any gas market due to their success in lobbying Parliament to block the granting of a charter for the National Heat and Light Company, their only real competitor in this field. However, despite blocking the charter until 1812 this advantage was squandered as Boulton and Watt did not develop the gas market, or technology, and in 1814 abandoned the gas business. A few decades later most towns in Britain were lit by gas and most had their own gasworks.|$|E

2500|$|Michael Pupin, {{inventor}} and Serbian immigrant to the USA, {{also played}} a part in the story of loading coils. [...] Pupin filed a rival patent to the one of Campbell's. [...] This patent of Pupin's dates from 1899. [...] There is an <b>earlier</b> <b>patent</b> (1894, filed December 1893) which is sometimes cited as Pupin's loading coil patent but is, in fact, something different. [...] The confusion is easy to understand, Pupin himself claims that he first thought of the idea of loading coils while climbing a mountain in 1894, although there is nothing from him published at that time.|$|E
50|$|Consequently, {{other jurisdictions}} {{such as the}} United Kingdom and New Zealand have held that a {{researcher}} may ignore a patent when conducting experiments. Fair research and experimentation is considered to end when the product or process is ready for commercial exploitation. Essentially, a researcher may patent the improvement of an existing patent, but cannot exploit it without {{the permission of the}} <b>earlier</b> <b>patent</b> holder until the <b>earlier</b> <b>patent</b> expires.|$|E

50|$|When an <b>earlier</b> <b>patent</b> was {{recovered}} and re-issued, the USPTO sometimes {{gave it a}} fractional number (e.g. 2960½X, issued on June 2, 1818; 8736¾X, issued on March 27, 1835) to preserve the correct sequence. Most, but not all, fractional patents are X-Patents.|$|E

50|$|Novelty is {{requirement}} {{for a patent}} claim to be patentable. In contrast, if an invention was known to the public before filing a patent application, or before its date of priority, if the priority of an <b>earlier</b> <b>patent</b> application is claimed, the invention is not considered new and therefore not patentable.|$|E
5000|$|Section 28.2 thus blocks patent {{applications}} if the applicant, {{or someone}} who obtained their knowledge from the applicant, made the invention public {{more than a year}} before applying; if anyone else made the invention public before the application; or if the invention is already subject to an <b>earlier</b> <b>patent</b> application.|$|E

5000|$|At {{least two}} parties are {{involved}} in an interference proceeding: the inventor(s) or applicant(s) who filed an <b>earlier</b> <b>patent</b> application are called the [...] "senior party", and the other inventor(s) or applicant(s) are called the [...] "junior party".

50|$|Novelty is a {{requirement}} for a patent claim to be patentable. An invention is not new and therefore not patentable if it was known to the public before the filing date of the patent application, or before its date of priority if the applicant claims priority of an <b>earlier</b> <b>patent</b> application. The purpose of the novelty requirement is to prevent prior art from being patented again.|$|E

50|$|Philips solved a {{significant}} problem with electronic displays in the mid-1990s by slanting the cylindrical lenses {{with respect to the}} underlying pixel grid. Based on this idea, Philips produced its WOWvx line until 2009, running up to 2160p (a resolution of 3840×2160 pixels) with 46 viewing angles. Lenny Lipton's company, StereoGraphics, produced displays based on the same idea, citing a much <b>earlier</b> <b>patent</b> for the slanted lenticulars. Magnetic3d and Zero Creative have also been involved.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{possible}} {{origin of}} this famous statement {{may actually be}} found in a report to Congress in 1843 by an <b>earlier</b> <b>Patent</b> Office Commissioner, Henry Ellsworth. In it Ellsworth states, [...] "The advancement of the arts, from year to year, taxes our credulity and seems to presage the arrival of that period when human improvement must end." [...] This quote was apparently then mispresented and attributed to Duell, who held the same office in 1899.|$|E
