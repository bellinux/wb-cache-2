5|$|After {{the events}} of Bloody Sunday in January 1905 sparked a {{revolution}} in Russia, Tsar Nicholas II was forced to make concessions. In April 1905 a <b>decree</b> guaranteed complete freedom of religion, and even allowed religious studies to be conducted in native languages. The most important <b>decree,</b> the October Manifesto, was announced on October 30 (October 17 O.S.), 1905. It guaranteed many political rights, {{including the right to}} form political parties and organize convocations. This <b>decree</b> formed the legal basis for the assembly in Vilnius. The October Manifesto also announced the intent to hold elections to the Russian Parliament (Duma), and the Lithuanian organizers used this as an official pretext for the Seimas: they claimed that the Lithuanians needed to prepare themselves for this election.|$|E
5|$|Before this {{parliamentary}} <b>decree,</b> the purchaser of a tulip contract—known {{in modern}} finance as a futures contract—was legally obliged {{to buy the}} bulbs. The <b>decree</b> {{changed the nature of}} these contracts, so that if the current market price fell, the purchaser could opt to pay a penalty and forgo receipt of the bulb, rather than pay the full contracted price. This change in law meant that, in modern terminology, the futures contracts had been transformed into options contracts. This proposal began to be debated in the fall of 1636, and if it became clear to investors that the <b>decree</b> was likely to be enacted, prices probably would have risen.|$|E

The revival of the censorship is fictitious, and Decius had been dead for several months by the date stated.|$|E

5|$|In {{the middle}} and later Republic, {{with the office of}} {{dictator}} falling out of fashion, the need for dictatorial authority was not granted to some extraordinary magistrate, but rather, to the consuls, through a senatus consultum ultimum, or final <b>decree.</b> This <b>decree</b> took the form of a recommendation from the Senate to the consuls to take whatever actions were necessary to defend the republic. Due to its general vagueness, however, its use was hotly contested in the late Republic and is still debated among scholars today, as in a strict legal sense, the final <b>decree</b> did not grant legal authority to the consuls, but rather, served as an urging from the Senate to ignore the laws to protect the state.|$|E

5|$|The Rosetta Stone is a {{granodiorite}} stele, {{found in}} 1799, inscribed with three {{versions of a}} <b>decree</b> issued at Memphis, Egypt in 196 BC during the Ptolemaic dynasty on behalf of King PtolemyV. The top and middle texts are in Ancient Egyptian using hieroglyphic script and Demotic script, respectively, while the bottom is in Ancient Greek. As the <b>decree</b> has only minor differences between the three versions, the Rosetta Stone {{proved to be the}} key to deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs.|$|E

The agreement is not an admission or evidence of liability, nor is it an admission by the city, CDP, or its officers and employees that they have engaged in unconstitutional, illegal, or otherwise improper activities or conduct.

5|$|The {{election}} of 1159 {{and the subsequent}} schism shows the necessity of amending the rules concerning papal elections. The <b>decree</b> Licet de evitanda discordia issued by the Third Lateran Council in 1179 abolished the rule of unanimity in favour {{of the rule of}} the majority of two thirds. The <b>decree</b> confirmed also that all three orders of the College of Cardinals (bishops, priests and deacons) are equal in the papal elections. Although the practice allowing the participation of cardinal-priests and cardinal-deacons on equal rights with cardinal-bishops had been introduced no later than in the papal election, 1118, the <b>decree</b> In Nomine Domini (1059) conferring the special electoral rights on the cardinal-bishops had never been formally revoked up to that time.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} {{friction}} within the Catholic groups, first over Sukarno's 1957 <b>decree</b> {{that he was}} president for life and establishment of a guided democracy policy. A faction, led by Soegijapranata, supported this <b>decree,</b> while Catholic Party leader I. J. Kasimo's faction was heavily against it. Sukarno, who had a good working relationship with Soegijapranata, asked the vicar to join the National Council, a request that Soegijapranata refused; he did, however, assign two delegates to the Council, ensuring Catholic representation. This, along with Soegijapranata's support of Sukarno's <b>decree</b> on 5 July 1949 calling {{for a return to}} the 1945 constitution, resulted in Bishop of Jakarta Adrianus Djajasepoetra's denunciation of Soegijapranata as a sycophant. However, Soegijapranata was strongly against Sukarno's idea of Nasakom, which based part of the nation's government on communism.|$|E

It analyses {{the context of the}} creation of these documents and then observes <b>decrees,</b> which influenced german (hungarian) minorities and then their future lives.

50|$|The exact {{role and}} {{attributions}} are defined in <b>decrees,</b> most notably <b>decrees</b> of 1964, 1982, 2004, each replacing the preceding one.|$|R
5|$|Two other fragmentary {{copies of}} the same <b>decree</b> were {{discovered}} later, and several similar Egyptian bilingual or trilingual inscriptions are now known, including two slightly earlier Ptolemaic decrees (the <b>Decree</b> of Canopus in 238 BC, and the Memphis <b>decree</b> of PtolemyIV, c. 218 BC). The Rosetta Stone is, therefore, no longer unique, {{but it was the}} essential key to modern understanding of Ancient Egyptian literature and civilisation. The term Rosetta Stone is now used in other contexts as the name for the essential clue to a new field of knowledge.|$|E
5|$|Upon taking power, Lenin's regime {{issued a}} series of decrees. The first was a <b>Decree</b> on Land, which {{declared}} that the landed estates of the aristocracy and the Orthodox Church should be nationalised and redistributed to peasants by local governments. This contrasted with Lenin's desire for agricultural collectivisation but provided governmental recognition of the widespread peasant land seizures that had already occurred. In November 1917, the government issued the <b>Decree</b> on the Press that closed many opposition media outlets deemed counter-revolutionary. They claimed the measure would be temporary; the <b>decree</b> was widely criticised, including by many Bolsheviks, for compromising freedom of the press.|$|E
5|$|According to Najmabadi, {{occasionally}} we {{come across}} the lion and sun with a sword in the lion's paw and with a crown during this period. The Mohammad Shah's <b>decree</b> in 1836 states that the lion must erectly stand, bear a saber ("to make it explicitly stands for the military prowess of the state"). The crown was also added {{as a symbol of}} royalty rather than for any particular Qajar monarch. The <b>decree</b> states that the emblem is at once the national, royal, and the state emblem of Iran. In this period the lion was depicted as more masculine and the sun was female. Before this time the sun could be male or female and the lion was represented as a swordless, friendly and subdued seated animal.|$|E
