40|$|This section {{provides}} the options to manage aging effects <b>during</b> <b>an</b> extended <b>period</b> <b>of</b> operation. Since {{this report is}} generically applicable to the plants identified in Section 1. 1 of this document, only program attributes are given. Plant-specific details will be developed during the preparation of license renewal applications. The program attributes are based on requirements currently accepted in the industry. Since the rate of age-related degradation does not change, for most aging effects these requirements will remain acceptable to maintain intended functions consistent with the CLB <b>during</b> <b>an</b> extended <b>period</b> <b>of</b> operation. Additional justification for aging effects that do not occur at a linear rate, if applicable, will be provided {{at the end of}} the program description in Section 4. 0. Therefore, PWR containment intended functions are maintained <b>during</b> <b>an</b> extended <b>period</b> <b>of</b> operation. Section 3. 0 identifies the aging effects that require management <b>during</b> <b>an</b> extended <b>period</b> <b>of</b> operation. Section 4. 1 provides program attributes using current license basis, and Section 4. 2 provides additional activities and attributes required to manage aging effects. Details and implementation guidance are provided. Deviations from the attributes provided will require descriptions and justifications in plant-specific applications. Aging management attributes are summarized by aging management program (AMP) tables (see Table 4 - 1). These tables summarize program attributes and activities that will be the basis for programs implemented by utilities <b>during</b> <b>an</b> extended <b>period</b> <b>of</b> operation...|$|R
