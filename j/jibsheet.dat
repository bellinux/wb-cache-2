6000|$|... "We've {{got to do}} it somehow," [...] he said. [...] "Stand by your lee <b>jibsheet</b> {{and tail}} on to the {{mainsheet}} the moment you let it run. Hold on till I tell you. We'll wait for a smooth." ...|$|E
60|$|They let the jib fly, {{and jumping}} for the {{mainsheet}} hauled {{with all their}} might, while Jake helped them with one hand as the boat {{came up to the}} wind. Then as a comber fell upon her they sprang back to the <b>jibsheet</b> and hauled upon it, while the spray flew all over them. It struck Frank that if the boat did not come round there would very speedily be an end of her. While he watched, holding his breath, the bows swung around a little farther, and working in frantic haste they let the sheet fly and made fast the opposite one, which was now to lee. She forged ahead on the other tack--and the most imminent peril was past.|$|E
50|$|The Watchdog (formerly The <b>Jibsheet)</b> is {{the weekly}} English-language student-run newspaper.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Jibsheet</b> ran {{an article}} {{about a group of}} 10 [...] "Real Life Superheroes" [...] in Seattle trying to help the {{homeless}} prevent their belongings from being stolen by gangs.|$|E
50|$|In most situations, the H16 mast is raked {{back as far}} as possible. You {{are limited}} by the {{distance}} between the boom and the rear crossmember and the distance between the clew of the jib and the <b>jibsheet</b> blocks. The cut of the jib was changed in 2000 to allow further rake and low profile jib and mainsheet blocks are essential.|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} {{and most}} common furling systems are for jibs and other headsails. These generally consist of either a plastic pipe or a specially stiffened jib, and a spool {{to hold the}} furling line. The jib {{is attached to the}} furler, and the line is wound around the spool. When the line is pulled, the furler turns, rolling up the jib; when the furling line is released, the <b>jibsheet</b> may be used to unfurl the jib.|$|E
50|$|To {{come out}} from the hove-to {{position}} and get under way again, the tiller or wheel is unlashed and the windward <b>jibsheet</b> is released, hauling in the normal leeward one. Bearing off the wind using the rudder will get the boat moving and then she can be maneuvered onto any desired course. It is important when choosing the tack, heaving to, and remaining hove to, in a confined space that adequate room is allowed for these maneuvers.|$|E
5000|$|... "Rope" [...] {{refers to}} the {{manufactured}} material. Once rope is purposely sized, cut, spliced, or simply assigned a function, the result {{is referred to as}} a [...] "line", especially in nautical usage. Sail control lines are mainly referred to as sheets (e.g. <b>jibsheet).</b> A halyard, for example, is a line used to raise and lower a sail, and is typically made of a length of rope with a shackle attached at one end. Other examples include clothesline, chalk line, anchor line ("rode"), stern line, fishing line, marline and so on.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, {{the vessel}} can simply be turned {{normally}} to tack through the wind, without freeing the <b>jibsheet.</b> The mainsail should self-tack onto the other side, but the jib is held aback. Finally the rudder is put the other way, {{as if trying}} to tack back again. Without the drive of the jib, she cannot do this and will stop hove to. This method is fast to implement and is recommended by sail training bodies such as the RYA as a 'quick stop' reaction to a man overboard emergency, for sailing boats that have an engine available for further maneuvers to approach and pick up the casualty.|$|E
