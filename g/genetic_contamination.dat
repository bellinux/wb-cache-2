Furthermore, data concerning the heritability of the factors are limited. Item and category-level factor analyses of YBOCS-CL items from 1224 OCD subjects were followed by heritability analyses in 52 OCD-affected multigenerational families. Item-level analyses indicated that a five factor model: (1) taboo, (2) contamination/ cleaning, (3) doubts, (4) superstitions/rituals, and (5) symmetry/hoarding provided the best fit, followed by a one-factor solution. All 5 factors as well as the one-factor solution were found to be heritable.

Individuals of each site were genotyped for eight microsatellite loci and levels of genetic diversity and differentiation were correlated to present-day estuarine characteristics and historical events. A general ecological state for each sampling site was obtained from a principal component analysis (PCA) applied to estuarine geomorphologic characteristics and levels of heavy metals and total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons <b>contamination.</b> <b>Genetic</b> diversity was higher than that previously reported for common goby in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. F-ST were generally very low (0. 000 - 0. 049), as well as Nei's genetic distances (0. 000 - 0. 167), although the later were statistically significant.

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), sustainable agriculture is the successful management of resources to satisfy the changing human needs while maintaining or enhancing the quality of environment and conserving natural resources. All definitions of sustainable agriculture lay great emphasis on maintaining an agricultural growth rate, which can meet the demand for food of all living beings without draining the basic resources towards crop improvement. Organic farming is one of the several approaches found to meet the objectives of sustainable agriculture. Most of the techniques used in organic farming like inter-cropping, mulching and integration of crops and livestock are not alien to agriculture systems including the traditional agricultural practices. However, organic farming is based on various laws and certification programmes, which prohibit the use of almost all synthetic inputs and the central theme of this method is the health of soil. The adverse effects of modern agricultural practices on the farm and also on the health of living beings and thus on the environment has been well documented all over the world.

40|$|In {{the meat}} industry, a ‘‘high event period’’ (HEP) {{is defined as}} a time period during which {{commercial}} meat plants experience a higher than usual rate of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 <b>contamination.</b> <b>Genetic</b> analysis indicated that within a HEP, most of the E. coli O 157 :H 7 strains belong to a singular dominant strain type. This was in disagreement with the current beef contamination model stating that contamination occurs when incoming pathogen load on animal hides, which consists of diverse strain types of E. coli O 157 :H 7, exceeds the intervention capacity. Thus, we hypothesize that the HEP contamination may be due to certain in-plant colonized E. coli O 157 :H 7 strains that are better able to survive sanitization through biofilm formation. To test our hypothesis, a collection of 45 E. coli O 157 :H 7 strains isolated from HEP beef contamination incidents and a panel of 47 E. coli O 157 :H 7 strains of diverse genetic backgrounds were compared for biofilm formation and sanitizer resistance. Biofilm formation was tested on 96 -well polystyrene plates for 1 to 6 days. Biofilm cell survival and recovery growth after sanitization were compared between the two strain collections using common sanitizers, including quaternary ammonium chloride, chlorine, and sodium chlorite. No difference in ‘‘early stage’’ biofilms was observed between the two strain collections after incubation at 22 to 25 ˚C for 1 or 2 days. However, the HEP strains demonstrated significantly higher potency of ‘‘mature’’ biofilm formation after incubation for 4 to 6 days. Biofilms of the HEP strains also exhibited significantly stronger resistance to sanitization. These data suggest that biofilm formation and sanitization resistance could have a role in HEP beef contamination by E. coli O 157 :H 7, which highlights the importance of proper and complete sanitization of food contact surfaces and food processing equipment in commercial meat plants...|$|R

Supporters of Monsanto argued that an oversight of this nature is not plausible, especially in light of Schmeiser's claims regarding the extent to which he considered Roundup Ready canola undesirable in his fields and the importance he claims to have placed on the continued survival of his own strain of canola, and in light of his having been notified prior to planting his 1998 crop that Monsanto believed he had grown Roundup Ready canola in 1997.

40|$|Artificial {{insemination}} (AI) {{has had a}} {{great influence}} {{on the development of}} pig production and is today widely practiced (Gerrit et al., 2005). With AI, genetic progress can at {{a short period of time}} be spread worldwide compared with using natural service and the best boars can be intensively used. This is also one of the biggest risks with AI; the impact of semen containing a <b>genetic</b> disease or <b>contamination</b> of pathogens can be enormous. Fortunately, it is a small risk of disease transmission due to many tests of the boars and the semen before use (Maes et al, 2008). It is important that the boars used for insemination have good breeding values along with good reproduction features and have good fertility results (Robinson et al., 2005). Furthermore, it is of economical interest that they produce high quality ejaculates with high number of sperms (Wierzbicki et al., 2010). The impact of the male´s reproductive efficiency, which is very important for the insemination industry, is not easily predicted (Robinson et al., 2005). The aim of this study was, with data on litter size and remating incidence from inseminated sows, analyze the variation in fertility among AI-boars from two different breeds, Landrace and Yorkshire. A second aim was to investigate if there are effects of season or parity number on fertility traits. The sows’ first litter had the lowest total number of total born piglets and live-born piglets. The total number of born piglets increased to the fifth litter. Highest litter size was found during late spring and early summer and the lowest during autumn. The results showed no effect of heterosis on litter size; instead the purebred litters of Landrace had the highest litter size. This is probably due to selection in the nucleus herds of secondary sows for crossbreeding and superior sows for purebreeding. Highest remating incidence was after weaning of the first litter. Among the 500 boars (with > 50 litters in the data) which were analyzed for remating incidence, 2. 6 % had none. There was a significant negative correlation between remating incidence and litter size for boars of both breeds.

Introduction. Giardia intestinalis is a protozoan parasite that causes a gastrointestinal infection known as giardiosis, which is transmitted primarily through fecal-oral <b>contamination.</b> <b>Genetic</b> studies of axenically cultivated Giardia isolates have identified two major genetic groups distributed throughout the world. In the present study 24 native strains of the parasite were analyzed by the RAPD technique (Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA). Objective. To determine the level of polymorphism and the complexity of Giardia intestinalis circulating strains in specific areas of Colombia. Materials and methods. The RAPD method was used, as it allows for a quick, simple and reliable analysis that requires no prior knowledge of the genetics of the parasite. A RAPD analysis was conducted on native isolates collected in Colombia between 1997 and 2001, established in continuous cultures. Several primers were tested separately, {{in order to enhance}} the capacity for discrimination of the method. Results. Of the 24 strains that were included in the study, 22 were arranged in independent clusters. The strains that were from the same geographic area and collected at about the same time, generally displayed highly similar but distinguishable RAPD patterns. Clones isolated from a strain were analyzed as well, and it was possible to differentiate them molecularly. Conclusion. The studied strains showed to belong to genotype A.

40|$|Abstract thesis Ximena Cadima Fuentes (to {{be defended}} on 8 Dec 2014) : Conserving the genetic {{diversity}} of Bolivian wild potatoes The wild relatives of potatoes (Solanum sect. Petota) form the genetic reservoir {{for the improvement}} of the cultivated potato. Bolivia harbours 39 wild taxa of these wild potatoes, 21 of which are endemic species. This study aimed to evaluate to what level the current ex situ and in situ management efforts have conserved the genetic diversity of Bolivian wild potato species, and what recommendations can be formulated for improvement. The current conservation status of Bolivian endemic wild potato species was assessed using both the globally accepted IUCN criteria and a methodology developed {{within the framework of the}} UNEP/GEF-Crop Wild Relative Project (CWR Project). These two methods led to different estimates of threat status for some of the species. Spatial analysis allowed to distinguish eight priority areas for in situ conservation of the 21 Bolivian endemic wild potato species. These areas represent a high concentration of endemic species and have a relatively low level of threat, but only one of them has a conservation status. This is a first step to direct the conservation efforts for wild potato species. The genetic stability and diversity of material from different species under ex situ management was evaluated using microsatellite markers. The analysis was performed on accessions that went through a process of seed regeneration and multiplication during ex situ conservation. Genetic changes between different generations of ex situ germplasm were observed for the majority, but not all, of the investigated species. Potential causes of these changes include <b>genetic</b> drift and <b>contamination</b> resulting from human error during regeneration. The populations generated under ex situ conditions were also compared with re-collected in situ populations from the same location or area as the original collection. The results showed highly significant differences in all cases. Potential causes for these differences are changes during ex situ maintenance, sampling effects during collecting and in situ genetic change over time. The integrated conservation of Bolivian wild potatoes requires a combination of in situ and ex situ activities. The principle recommendation for the in situ conservation is to move from a passive to an active approach, where conservation areas are prioritized, conservation plans are designed according to the type of area (protected area or agro-ecosystem) and local stake holders are involved. To make sure that ex situ material provides a good representation of the in situ genetic variability, regular re-collecting of species with few accessions (and therefore less variability), endangered in situ, and with known or potential favorable traits is necessary. Gene bank management procedures should follow the FAO gene bank standards and this should be monitored by a national body responsible for genetic resources. And finally, periodic monitoring of the genetic integrity should be implemented as part of good practices during regeneration procedures in order to detect possible changes and to help combat human errors.  ...|$|R
