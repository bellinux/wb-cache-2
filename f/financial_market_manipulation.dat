30|$|Social media expose {{millions}} of users {{every day to}} information campaigns - some emerging organically from grassroots activity, others sustained by advertising or other coordinated efforts. These campaigns contribute to the shaping of collective opinions. While most information campaigns are benign, some may be deployed for nefarious purposes, including terrorist propaganda, political astroturf, and <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> <b>manipulation.</b> It is therefore important {{to be able to}} detect whether a meme is being artificially promoted at the very moment it becomes wildly popular. This problem has important social implications and poses numerous technical challenges. As a first step, here we focus on discriminating between trending memes that are either organic or promoted by means of advertisement. The classification is not trivial: ads cause bursts of attention that can be easily mistaken for those of organic trends. We designed a machine learning framework to classify memes that have been labeled as trending on Twitter. After trending, we can rely on a large volume of activity data. Early detection, occurring immediately at trending time, is a more challenging problem due to the minimal volume of activity data that is available prior to trending. Our supervised learning framework exploits hundreds of time-varying features to capture changing network and diffusion patterns, content and sentiment information, timing signals, and user meta-data. We explore different methods for encoding feature time series. Using {{millions of}} tweets containing trending hashtags, we achieve 75 % AUC score for early detection, increasing to above 95 % after trending. We evaluate the robustness of the algorithms by introducing random temporal shifts on the trend time series. Feature selection analysis reveals that content cues provide consistently useful signals; user features are more informative for early detection, while network and timing features are more helpful once more data is available.|$|E
40|$|Common wisdom among post-socialist reformers has beento use voucher {{investment}} {{funds to}} provide the corporate governance needed to restructure newly privatized enterprises after mass privatization efforts. The idea has been that mass privatization would spread the ownership too wide and make corporate governance difficult. The author examines the likely institutional behavior of voucher funds and the possible effects of their development on a transition economy. Since most policy advice has been in favor of voucher privatization with investment funds, the author {{can be seen as}} playing the devil's advocate, but his argument is institutional, not statistical. Policymaking requires insight and foresight into how institutions will tend to function. He concludes that voucher funds will introduce a bias in the economy away from the real industrial sector toward an ersatz"financial sector"that will have little if any positive financial role but will be well-protected by friendly regulators. One long-term consequence of voucher privatization with investment funds, according to this view, is a de facto"industrial policy"of real sector decapitalization in favor of short-term rent-seeking by fund managers through board sinecures and lucrative side deals with portfolio companies and through <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> <b>manipulation</b> and paper entrepreneurship in the"financial sector. "Without strong corporate governance from the funds and without stable ownership of their own, many enterprise managers will exploit the post-socialist version of the"separation of ownership and control"to grab what they can in the form of salaries, bonuses, perquisites, and side deals. The most likely results of the strategy of voucher privatization with investment funds may be a two-sided grab fest by fund managers and enterprise managers [...] together with the accompanying drift, stagnation, and decapitalization of the privatized industrial sector.

40|$|Risky {{decisions}} made by humans exhibit characteristics common to each decision. The related systems experience repeated abuse by risky humans and their actions collude to form a systemic behavioural set. Financial fraud {{is an example of}} such risky behaviour. Fraud detection models have drawn attention since the financial crisis of 2008 because of their frequency, size and technological advances leading to <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> <b>manipulation.</b> Statistical methods dominate industrial fraud detection systems at banks, insurance companies and financial marketplaces. Most efforts thus far have focused on anomaly detection problems and simple rules in the academic literature and industrial setting. There are unsolved issues in modeling the behaviour of risky agents in real-world financial markets using machine learning. This research studies the challenges posed by fraud detection, including the problem of imbalanced class distributions, and investigates the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to model risky human behaviour. Models have been developed to transform the relevant financial data into a state-space system. Reinforcement Learning agents uncover the decision-making processes by risky humans and derive an optimal path of behaviour {{at the end of the}} learning process. States are weighted by risk and then classified as positive (risky) or negative (not-risky). The positive samples are composed of features that represent the hidden information underlying the risky behaviour. Reinforcement Learning is implemented as unsupervised and supervised models. The unsupervised learning agent searches for risky behaviour without any previous knowledge of the data; it is not “trained” on data with true class labels. Instead, the RL learner relates samples through experience. The supervised learner is trained on a proportion (e. g. 90 %) of the data with class labels. It derives a policy of optimal actions to be taken at each state during the training stage. One policy is selected from several learning agents and then the model is exposed to the other proportion (e. g. 10 %) of data for classification. RL is hybridized with a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) in the supervised learning model to impose a probabilistic framework around the risky agent’s behaviour. We first study an insider trading example to demonstrate how learning algorithms can mimic risky agents. The classification power of the model is further demonstrated by applying it to a real-world based database for debit card transaction fraud. We then apply the models to two problems found in Statistics Canada databases: heart disease detection and female labour force participation. All models are evaluated using appropriate measures for imbalanced class problems: “sensitivity” and “false positive”. Sensitivity measures the number of correctly classified positive samples (e. g. fraud) as a proportion of all positive samples in the data. False positive counts the number of negative samples classified positive as a proportion of all negative samples in the data. The intent is to maximize sensitivity and minimize the false positive rate. All models show high sensitivity rates while exhibiting low false positive rates. These two metrics are ideal for industrial implementation because of high levels of identification at a low cost. Fraud detection rate is the focus with detection rates of 75 - 85 % proving that RL is a superior method for data mining of imbalanced databases. By solving the problem of hidden information, this research can facilitate the detection of risky human behaviour and prevent it from happening...|$|E

40|$|Fraudsters {{periodically}} {{attempt to}} enrich themselves by employing {{a raft of}} tricks and schemes to exploit investors and <b>financial</b> <b>markets.</b> <b>Market</b> <b>manipulation</b> (‘manipulation’) is one such class of illegitimate conduct. It perverts the market price formation process and undermines public confidence in <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> integrity. An effective prohibition on manipulation is thus required to protect investors from fraud and promote market integrity, thereby fostering investment and economic growth. Chapter 1 of this thesis defines manipulation and argues that the current anti-manipulation regime, ss 1041 A– 1041 C of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), requires substantive reform. This regime is predicated on a conceptually unsound understanding of manipulation. It fails to articulate the nature and role of manipulative intention {{and is based on}} an unclear distinction between civil penalties and criminal offences. As such, the scope of liability is sometimes too broad and at other times too narrow. Additionally, the provisions are internally defective, as they suffer from ambiguous language. They are also overly complex and have inconsistent physical and fault requirements. The Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) exacerbates these problems. Chapter 2 advances a two-pronged proposal for substantive law reform. Principally, two criminal prohibitions on manipulation should replace the current regime. These will prohibit a person from executing a transaction, or doing, or omitting to do, an act, when motivated by the dominant purpose of manipulating the market for, or price of, a financial product. The provisions clearly articulate the requisite manipulative intention and have an appropriate scope of liability. They are also easier to enforce than the current regime, as two deeming provisions facilitate proof of manipulative intention. 4 The proposed regime is complemented by a Serious <b>Financial</b> <b>Market</b> Crimes Act 2014 (Cth). This contains prohibitions on manipulation and other conduct that undermines <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> integrity, reinforcing the serious criminal nature of manipulation and enhancing the credibility of ASIC’s enforcement actions. It may also motivate Parliament to articulate its policy objectives in greater detail.

Securities {{manipulation}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious abuses of the financial markets and is thus forbidden by law. The protection against the criminal acts of securities manipulation in the financial markets is regulated by the Slovenian Penal Code in its 239 th article (abuse of financial markets). Furthermore, the acts described by the 231 th (swindling in the trade with securities) and the 238 th (misuse of inside information) articles of the same Penal Code can be also interpreted as market manipulation. The criminal act of financial market abuse in the new 239 th article of the Penal Code closely depicts the definition of the market manipulation described by the first paragraph of the 374 th article of the Slovenian Financial Market Law. With certain changes in content and language, the 231 th and the 238 th article of the Penal Code became even closer to the exact definition of the manipulation of financial markets. Minor offences resulting from <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> <b>manipulation</b> are covered by the Slovenian Financial Market Law and are sanctioned by a money fine. Here, the signs of the criminal acts according to the articles 231 th, 238 th and 239 th of the Penal Code directly correspond to the signs of minor offences covered by the fifth paragraph of the 556 th article of the Financial Market Law in connection with the fourth point of the first paragraph of the 556 th article of the Financial Market Lawfirst and second points of the first paragraph of the 566 th article of the Financial Market Law and the fourth paragraph of the 566 th article of the Financial Market Law in connection with the 374 th article of the same act. The lawmaker should therefore abolish these inconsistencies. Criminal offence as well as minor offence protection against the manipulation in the financial markets is however insufficient. A big problem in this context is the proving of the illegal acts of manipulators. With optimized regulation of this problematic area, e. g. change of sanctions for these acts, introduction of reverse burden of proof procedure, consideration of expert opinions and proposals in description of criminal acts of manipulation, etc., we would improve the protection that should be provided by these laws. The financial markets manipulation is still a frequent phenomenon in practice despite the enforcement of corresponding laws.

40|$|<b>Market</b> <b>manipulation</b> is {{an illegal}} {{practice}} that enables {{a person can}} profit from practices that artificially raise or lower the prices of an instrument in the <b>financial</b> <b>markets.</b> Its prohibition {{is based on the}} 2003 Market Abuse Directive in the EU. The current <b>market</b> <b>manipulation</b> regime was broadly considered as a big success except for enforcement and supervisory inconsistencies in the Member States at the initial. A review of the <b>market</b> <b>manipulation</b> regime began at the end of 2007, which became quickly incorporated into the wider EU crisis-era reform program. A number of weaknesses of current regime have been identified, which include regulatory gaps caused by the development of trading venues and financial products, regulatory gaps concerning cross-border and cross-markets <b>manipulation</b> (particular commodity <b>markets),</b> legal uncertainty as a result of various implementation, and inefficient supervision and enforcement. On 12 June 2014, a new regulatory package of market abuse, Market Abuse Regulation and Directive on criminal sanctions for market abuse, has been adopted. And several changes will be made concerning the EU <b>market</b> <b>manipulation</b> regime. A wider scope of the regime and a new prohibition of attempted <b>market</b> <b>manipulation</b> will ensure the prevention of <b>market</b> <b>manipulation</b> at large. The AMPs will be subject to strict scrutiny of ESMA to reduce divergences in implementation. In order to enhance efficiency of supervision and enforcement, powers of national competent authorities will be strengthened, ESMA is imposed more power to settle disagreement between national regulators, and the administrative and criminal sanctioning regimes are both further harmonized. In addition, the protection of fundamental rights is stressed by the new <b>market</b> <b>manipulation</b> regime, and some measures are provided to guarantee its realization. Further, the success EU <b>market</b> <b>manipulation</b> regime could be of significant reference to China, helping China to refine its immature regime. ...|$|R

40|$|Benchmarks are metrics {{that are}} deeply {{embedded}} in the <b>financial</b> <b>markets.</b> They {{are essential to the}} efficient functioning of the markets and are used {{in a wide variety of}} ways-from pricing oil to setting interest rates for consumer lending to valuing complex financial instruments. In recent years, benchmarks have also been at the epicenter of numerous, multi-year <b>market</b> <b>manipulation</b> scandals. Oil traders, for example, deliberately execute trades to drive benchmarks lower artificially, allowing the traders to capitalize on the manipulated benchmarks. This ensures that later trades relying on the benchmarks will be more profitable than they otherwise would have been. Such manipulative practices have far-reaching and, in some instances, destabilizing effects on the <b>financial</b> <b>markets.</b> In responding to these benchmark manipulation scandals, regulators have relied on the existing anti-manipulation framework, which is based solely on ex post prosecution of wrongdoers. The current framework treats benchmark manipulation as just another form of <b>market</b> <b>manipulation.</b> But, as more benchmark manipulation schemes come to light, they cast doubt on the effectiveness of this traditional approach to curbing a modern-day form of manipulation.

This title {{can be divided into}} two main forms, insider dealing and <b>market</b> <b>manipulation.</b> This research primarily aimed at exploring the regulation of <b>market</b> <b>manipulation</b> in Kuwaiti law. <b>Market</b> <b>manipulation</b> practises came under regulation for the first time via Law No. 7 in 2010. Therefore, it is essential to differentiate between the periods; before and after the issuance of this law. Hence, there are four main objectives to this study: 1) define <b>market</b> <b>manipulation</b> and its common forms, 2) explore the applicability of criminal and civil Kuwaiti law to <b>market</b> <b>manipulation</b> practises prior Law No. 7, 3) critically evaluate how well this law covers the forms of <b>market</b> <b>manipulation</b> identified and 4) evaluate how effective the law is through its enforcement and implementation. To achieve these objectives, different methods have been followed. Overall, this research follows a critical analysis approach. In addition, the extant literature has been explored. The evaluation of Law No. 7 has been conducted using the more established regulatory law, the FSMA 2000, was taken as a basis for the analysis and evaluation. It has been found that prior to Law No. 7 of 2010, regulation of <b>market</b> <b>manipulation</b> practises was almost non-existent. Law No. 7 of 2010 does largely cover most forms of <b>market</b> <b>manipulation,</b> excluding stabilizing the security price and information based on manipulation of forms.

40|$|Market abuse {{practices}} may {{directly or}} indirectly give rise to diverse problems such as inaccurate stock market prices, low public investor confidence, reduced market integrity and poor efficiency in the affected <b>financial</b> <b>markets.</b> This thesis reveals that three major forms of market abuse, namely insider trading, prohibited trading practices (trade-based <b>market</b> <b>manipulation)</b> and the making or publication of false, misleading or deceptive statements, promises and forecasts relating to listed securities (disclosure-based <b>market</b> <b>manipulation)</b> are prohibited in South Africa. However, although South Africa has had market abuse legislation for about 30 years, and must be commended for its great effort to enhance market integrity by combating market abuse practices, the enforcement of such legislation is still problematic. Moreover, {{in spite of the}} fact that there is no empirical data or accurate figures quantifying the occurrence and extent of market abuse activities in the South African <b>financial</b> <b>markets,</b> this thesis submits that market abuse practices are still to be completely eradicated. Accordingly, this thesis suggests that the aforementioned problem might have been aggravated by inter alia, various gaps, flaws and/or inconsistent implementation and enforcement of the market abuse legislation in South Africa. To this end, the anti-market abuse enforcement framework under the Securities Services Act 36 of 2004 is analysed to investigate its adequacy. The co-operation and role of the Financial Services Board, the courts, the Directorate of Market Abuse and other relevant stakeholders is also examined and discussed. Moreover, the co-operation between the Financial Services Board and similar international agencies is discussed to gauge its effectiveness in relation to the combating of cross-border market abuse practices. The adequacy of the awareness and preventative measures in place to curb market abuse practices is also investigated to determine whether such measures are robust enough to combat other new challenges that were posed by the 2007 to 2009 global financial crisis. Furthermore, a comparative analysis is undertaken of the enforcement of the market abuse prohibition in other jurisdictions, namely the United States of America, the United Kingdom, the European Union and Australia. This was done to investigate the relevant lessons that can be learnt or adopted from these jurisdictions. The thesis further discusses the adequacy of the recently introduced provisions of the <b>Financial</b> <b>Markets</b> Bill as well as the subsequent market abuse provisions of the <b>Financial</b> <b>Markets</b> Bill 2012. The thesis highlights that the aforementioned Bills are positive attempts by the policy makers to improve the enforcement of the market abuse provisions in South Africa. Nonetheless, the thesis reveals that most of the shortcomings contained in the Securities Services Act 36 of 2004 were duplicated in the <b>Financial</b> <b>Markets</b> Bill and the <b>Financial</b> <b>Markets</b> Bill 2012. In light of this, it remains to be seen whether the market abuse provisions contained in the <b>Financial</b> <b>Markets</b> Bill and/or the <b>Financial</b> <b>Markets</b> Bill 2012 will improve the combating of market abuse practices in South Africa. Consequently, it is hoped that the relevant market abuse provisions of the Securities Services Act 36 of 2004, the <b>Financial</b> <b>Markets</b> Bill and/or the <b>Financial</b> <b>Markets</b> Bill 2012 will be comprehensively reviewed in regard to the recommendations made in this thesis. To this end, the thesis proposes a viable anti-market abuse model and policy framework and sets out both policy objectives and provisions which policy makers could use to strengthen some of the market abuse provisions in South Africa...|$|R

In our modern frontier, while some hedge funds undoubtedly have helped make our <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> more efficient, other hedge funds may have hurt investors and the <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> through investor fraud, <b>market</b> <b>manipulation,</b> and additional <b>market</b> failure risk. The negative effects of hedge funds have persisted largely because hedge funds have remained lightly regulated. Investors and the <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> need and desire some protection. More importantly, the recent rapid growth in the size and scope of hedge funds has made them the biggest players in the global <b>financial</b> <b>markets.</b> As a result of this rapid growth, unregulated hedge fund activity poses an ever-increasing threat to the very stability of the global <b>financial</b> <b>markets...</b>|$|R
50|$|Market {{microstructure}} is {{a branch}} of finance concerned with {{the details of how}} exchange occurs in markets. While the theory of market microstructure applies to the exchange of real or financial assets, more evidence is available on the microstructure of <b>financial</b> <b>markets</b> due to the availability of transactions data from them. The major thrust of market microstructure research examines {{the ways in which the}} working processes of a market affects determinants of transaction costs, prices, quotes, volume, and trading behavior. Recent innovations have allowed an expansion into the study of the impact of market microstructure on the incidence of market abuse, such as insider trading, <b>market</b> <b>manipulation</b> and broker-client conflict.|$|R
40|$|This book {{analyzes}} {{in depth}} all major derivatives debacles {{of the last}} half century including the multi-billion losses and/or bankruptcy of Metallgesellschaft (1994), Barings Bank (1995), Long Term Capital Management (1998), Amaranth (2006), Société Générale (2008) and AIG (2008). It unlocks the secrets of derivatives by telling the stories of institutions which played in the derivative market and lost big. For some of these unfortunate organizations it was daring but flawed financial engineering which brought them havoc. For others it was unbridled speculation perpetrated by rogue traders whose unchecked fraud brought their house down. Should derivatives be feared â€œas financial weapons of mass destructionâ€ or hailed as financial innovations which through efficient risk transfer are truly adding to the Wealth of Nations? By presenting a factual analysis of how the malpractice of derivatives played havoc with derivative end-user and dealer institutions, a case is made for vigilance not only to market and counter-party risk but also operational risk in their use for risk management and proprietary trading. Clear and recurring lessons across the different stories call not only for a tighter but also â€œsmarterâ€ control system of derivatives trading and should be of immediate interest to financial managers, bankers, traders, auditors and regulators who are directly or indirectly exposed to financial derivatives. The book groups cases by derivative category, starting with the simplest and building up to the most complex â€” namely, Forwards, Futures, Options and Swaps in that order, with applications in commodities, foreign exchange, stock indices and interest rates. Each chapter deals with one derivative debacle, providing a rigorous and comprehensive but non-technical elucidation of what happened.

40|$|In {{an early}} attempt to combat market {{abuse in the}} South African <b>financial</b> <b>markets,</b> {{legislation}} such as the Companies Act, the <b>Financial</b> <b>Markets</b> Control Act and the Stock Exchanges Control Act were enacted. However, these Acts failed to effectively curb market abuse activities that were allegedly rife in the <b>financial</b> <b>markets.</b> Consequently, the Insider Trading Act was enacted and came into effect on 17 January 1999. While {{the introduction of the}} Insider Trading Act brought some confidence in the <b>financial</b> <b>markets,</b> market abuse activities were still not extinguished. The provisions of the Insider Trading Act were to some extent inadequate and ineffectively implemented. Eventually, the Securities Services Act was enacted to repeal all the flawed provisions of the Insider Trading Act. Notwithstanding these efforts {{on the part of the}} legislature, more may still need to be done to increase the number of convictions and settlements in cases involving market abuse in South Africa. It is against this background that a historical overview analysis of the regulation of market abuse is carried out in this article to expose the flaws that were previously embedded in the South African market abuse laws prior to 2004. This is done to raise awareness of the situation on the part of the relevant stakeholders, as they consider whether such flaws were adequately resolved or subsequently re-introduced under the Securities Services Act and the <b>Financial</b> <b>Markets</b> Act. To this end, the article firstly discusses the historical development and regulation of <b>market</b> <b>manipulation</b> prior to 2004. Secondly, the regulation and enforcement of insider trading legislation prior to 2004 are examined. Moreover, where possible, certain flaws of the previous market abuse laws that were re-incorporated into the current South African market abuse legislation are isolated and recommendations are made in that regard...|$|R

40|$|A Working Group of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) {{under the}} {{chairmanship}} of Dr. R. H. Patil has recommended that Indian government securities should be traded in two separate and segregated markets. Banks and primary dealers are to trade on an anonymous electronic screen based order matching trading system - a monopoly exchange based on the Negotiated Dealing System (NDS) owned by the RBI. Households, pension and provident funds and most other investors are proposed to be relegated to a separate segregated market driven by compulsory market making. The Patil Report also recommends that the RBI should indulge in systematic <b>market</b> <b>manipulation</b> in the NDS to reduce the borrowing cost of the government. This paper argues for a reconsideration of most elements of this design. Government securities are a unique asset class to which all Indians should have non discriminatory access. Segregated markets are unacceptable. Nor are monopolies desirable since intense competition is the principal mechanism for fostering innovation and investor protection. <b>Market</b> <b>manipulation</b> is unacceptable in any <b>financial</b> <b>market</b> even if this manipulation is performed by the state itself. Moreover <b>market</b> <b>manipulation</b> to reduce interest rates would reintroduce financial repression {{through the back door}} and would reverse the principal success of the financial sector reforms initiated in 1991. The paper proposes an alternative design for the government securities market and also a new regulatory architecture. Unified markets, non discriminatory access to all classes of investors, intense competition and investor protection are the key elements of the proposed design. ...|$|R

These rules are primarily reactive, and depend on vague and difficult measures such as the “artificiality ” of a resulting market price or the trader’s intention. Some trades, like matched and wash sales, have indeed been singled out since the 1930 ’s for special scrutiny, but this list has never been updated. Through even a cursory {{review of existing literature}} in <b>financial</b> economics and <b>market</b> microstructure, lawmakers and regulators would be able to know the times, the market conditions, and the types of securities that facilitate and give greatest incentive for trade-based <b>market</b> <b>manipulation,</b> as well as the manipulative techniques best adapted to each, specific situation. Rapid advance in the technological prowess of some institutional traders has lent urgency to the task of updating rules on <b>market</b> <b>manipulation.</b> The playing field between high-powered and retail traders has become so uneven that soon our original understanding of securities markets will be eclipsed.

The Russian rules do not work; {{no one has}} been charged or sentenced for <b>market</b> <b>manipulation</b> since the relevant laws came into force. The Russian rules on criminal liability for <b>market</b> <b>manipulation</b> do not complement the general rules on fraud, they duplicate them. Our prohibition on <b>market</b> <b>manipulation</b> is unclear and is not comprehensive, i. e., there are gaps in the law. This prohibition and the criminal law rules based on it require serious revision; it is necessary to eliminate the gaps and make the law clear. It is inappropriate to subordinate the liability for this crime to the fact of causing consequences expressed formally in a sum of money. The rule of law requires a logical generalization. Establishing criminal liability for negligent <b>market</b> <b>manipulation</b> in Russia seems premature...|$|R
