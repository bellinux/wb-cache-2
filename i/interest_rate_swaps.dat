Through a joint effort between the IBRD and the International Finance Corporation, the Bank offers financing to subnational entities either with or without sovereign guarantees. For borrowers needing quick financing for an unexpected change, the IBRD operates a Deferred Drawdown Option {{which serves as a}} line of credit with features similar to the Bank's flexible loan program. Among the World Bank Group's credit enhancement and guarantee products, the IBRD offers policy-based guarantees to cover countries' sovereign default risk, partial credit guarantees to cover the credit risk of a sovereign government or subnational entity, and partial risk guarantees to private projects to cover a government's failure to meet its contractual obligations. The IBRD's Enclave Partial Risk Guarantee to cover private projects in member countries of the IDA against sovereign governments' failures to fulfill contractual obligations. The Bank provides an array of financial risk management products including foreign exchange swaps, currency conversions, <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>swaps,</b> interest rate caps and floors, and commodity swaps. To help borrowers protect against catastrophes and other special risks, the bank offers a Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option to provide financing after a natural disaster or declared state of emergency. It also issues catastrophe bonds which transfer catastrophic risks from borrowers to investors. The IBRD reported $26.7 billion in lending commitments for 132 projects in fiscal year 2011, significantly less than its $44.2 billion in commitments during fiscal year 2010.|$|E

40|$|Swap is a {{financial}} contract between two counterparties who agree to exchange one cash flow stream for another, {{according to some}} predetermined rules. When the cash flows are fixed <b>rate</b> <b>interest</b> and floating <b>rate</b> <b>interest,</b> the <b>swap</b> is called an <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>swap.</b> This paper investigates two valuation models of the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> contracts in the uncertain financial market.
