The palaeoglaciological boundary conditions are defined by geological data on timing and extent of the last glaciation obtained {{in the course of}} the EU funded project "Eurasian Ice Sheets". These data prove beyond any doubt, that with the exception of the northwestern fringe of the Taymyr Peninsula, the rest of the Eurasian mainland and Severnaya Zemlya were not affected by the Barents-Kara Sea <b>fee</b> <b>Sheet</b> during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Inversed modelling based on these results shows that a progressive cooling which started around 30 ka BP, caused ice growth in Scandinavia and the northwestern areas of the Barents-Kara Sea shelf, due to a maritime climate with relatively high precipitation along the western flank of the developing ice sheets. In the rest of the Eurasian Arctic extremely low precipitation rates (less than 50 mm yr(- 1)), did not allow ice sheet growth in spite of the very cold temperatures. Palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental conditions for the time prior to, during, and after the LGM have been reconstructed for the non-glaciated areas around the LGM ice sheet with the use of faunal and vegetation records, permafrost, eolian sediments, alluvial deposits and other evidences. The changing environment, from interstadial conditions around 30 ka BP to a much colder and drier environment at the culmination of the LGM at 20 - 15 ka BP, and the beginning of warming around 15 ka BP have been elaborated from the field data, which fits well with the modelling results.

5000|$|In 2012 the Law Society of South Australia {{published}} a fact sheet on appropriating Trust Money for Payment of <b>Fees.</b> The fact <b>sheet</b> explains {{that if a}} practitioner posts a bill for fees to a client, it is not legally considered to have been [...] "delivered" [...] in accordance with section 41(1) of the Act, until the minimum {{amount of time in}} which the bill would be delivered in the ordinary course of post has passed. The Law Society recommends that 3 business days be allowed to pass after posting the bill before appropriation of trust money towards that bill. Further, the Law Society states that if the client objects to the bill the trust money should remain in trust.|$|R
