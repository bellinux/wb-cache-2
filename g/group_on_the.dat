5|$|A {{surprisingly}} fast {{beginning to}} the stage, with a first hour that covered over , {{managed to keep}} any breakaways from going clear for over two hours. Twelve eventually came ahead of the peloton, with seven in the lead and five chasing between the leaders and the peloton. The third <b>group</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road eventually dwindled to a select contingent of overall favorites, which included race leader Danilo Di Luca. Former Giro champion Stefano Garzelli attacked from this <b>group</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> day's first climb and got to the leading group of five before the summit, claiming maximum points on it and on Sestrière to gain leadership of the mountains classification {{at the end of}} the day. Garzelli's maximum advantage, at the summit of Sestrière, was just over six minutes.|$|E
5|$|As the Giro left Austria, {{the race}} began {{to enter the}} Dolomites during stage fourteen. The {{eventual}} stage winner Marco Pantani was in a chasing <b>group</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> final climb of the stage, the Passo di Monte Giovo. He attacked, bridged the gap to the leading group, and left them behind to claim his first professional victory of his career. The next stage saw Pantani win again after he rode away from the attack <b>group</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> last climb of the Valico di Santa Cristina and he then soloed to the finish in Stradella. Pantani's efforts on the day moved him up to second overall in the race. The race's sixteenth stage took {{a break from the}} mountains with the stage being primarily fled, which ultimately led to the sprint finish that was won by Italian Maximilian Sciandri. Ján Svorada won the next day's stage after attacking from the breakaway group in the closing seconds.|$|E

50|$|It is {{important}} to note that the Alder-Stein principle has no bearing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> relative orientation of <b>groups</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> two starting materials. One cannot predict, via this principle, whether a substituent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> diene will be syn or anti to a substituent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dienophile. The Alder-Stein principle is only consistent across the self-same starting materials. The relationship is only valid for <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> diene alone, or <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dienophile, alone. The relative orientation of groups between the two reactants can be predicted by the endo selection rule.|$|R

30|$|It was {{important}} to quantify the amount of carboxyl <b>groups</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> microbeads surface, the functionality of these carboxyl groups, as well as investigate the morphological (size and shape) and fluorescence stability of the encoded microbeads. BCG assay was chosen to estimate the amount of carboxyl <b>groups</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> microbeads surface [38]. Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> standard curve plotted using known carboxyl concentrations in standard solutions of CEST (Fig. S 3 a), the amount of carboxyl <b>groups</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> microbeads surface was approximately estimated to be 0.17  M/ 5  µL of microbeads sample or 6.78  ×  1010  mol of carboxyl groups/microbead.|$|R
5|$|In 1976, it was {{suggested}} that the brolga, sarus crane (Antigone antigone) and white-naped crane (Antigone vipio) formed a natural <b>group</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> basis of similarities in their calls. This was further confirmed by molecular studies of their DNA. These also showed that the brolga is more closely related to the white-naped crane than it is to the morphologically more similar sarus crane.|$|E

Mikhail sacrifices himself with a grenade, causing the car to crash into the tower's main courtyard and separating Jill and Carlos briefly. At the Clock Tower, Jill summons the helicopter by ringing the Clock Tower's bell before being confronted by Nemesis, which destroys the helicopter and infects Jill with the T-virus. Jill manages to temporarily defeat Nemesis but falls unconscious due to the T-Virus. Carlos finds Jill and takes her to safety within the Clock Tower. Three days later, he manages to find a cure for Jill's T-Virus infection in the Raccoon City General Hospital. He returns to Jill and injects her with a vaccine, saving her.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the First World War, the Egyptian police controlling the Sinai Peninsula had withdrawn, leaving the area largely unprotected. In February 1915, a German and Ottoman force unsuccessfully attacked the Suez Canal. Minor Ottoman and Bedouin forces operating across the Sinai continued to threaten the canal from March through the Gallipoli Campaign until June, when they practically ceased until the autumn. Meanwhile, the German and Ottoman Empires supported an uprising by the Senussi (a political-religious <b>group)</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> western frontier of Egypt which began in November 1915.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{generally}} praised The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill for Hill's {{presentation of}} a woman's view on life and love, along with her artistic range. New Ark, however, felt Hill and her record label did not properly credit the <b>group</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> album; {{a lawsuit filed by}} the group was settled out of court in 2001. Since the record's release, it has been ranked in numerous best-album lists, with a number of critics regarding it {{as one of the greatest}} albums of the 1990s, as well as one of the greatest albums of all time. In 2015, it was included by the Library of Congress in the National Recording Registry.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} pentose residues of the bases, DNA strands have directionality. One end of a DNA polymer contains an exposed hydroxyl <b>group</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> deoxyribose; {{this is known as}} the 3'end of the molecule. The other end contains an exposed phosphate group; this is the 5'end. The two strands of a double-helix run in opposite directions. Nucleic acid synthesis, including DNA replication and transcription occurs in the 5'→3'direction, because new nucleotides are added via a dehydration reaction that uses the exposed 3'hydroxyl as a nucleophile.|$|E

5|$|For {{three months}} Braham {{remained}} inactive. In February 1944 he was posted to No. 2 Group RAF as 'wing commander night operations' {{attached to the}} 2nd Light Bomber Group, RAF Second Tactical Air Force. Although a staff officer at HQ, Braham was able, with persistence, to persuade his commanding officer, Air Vice Marshal Basil Embry {{to allow him to}} 'free-lance' intruder operations using a De Havilland Mosquito loaned from one of the various squadrons in the <b>group</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> proviso he asked his permission beforehand. Braham also had his former radar operators transferred to the group's headquarters so he could fly with them. He frequently borrowed aircraft from No. 613 Squadron RAF.|$|E
5|$|Groups are {{frequently}} studied through group representations. In their most general form, these {{consist of a}} choice of group, a set, and an action of the <b>group</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> set, that is, an operation which takes {{an element of the}} group and an element of the set and returns an element of the set. Most often, the set is a vector space, and the group represents symmetries of the vector space. For example, there is a group which represents the rigid rotations of space. This is a type of symmetry of space, because space itself does not change when it is rotated even though the positions of objects in it do. Noether used these sorts of symmetries in her work on invariants in physics.|$|E
5|$|In 1942 Bessie and Jack {{moved to}} what would be their home for the {{remainder}} of their lives, a suburban semi-detached house in ZigZag Road, in Liverpool's West Derby district. They remained active members of Liverpool council, and in 1943 Jack became deputy leader of the Labour group. Two years later the Braddocks healed the rift with Hogan by proposing and seconding his appointment as the city's Lord Mayor for the year 1945–46; Jack succeeded him as leader of the Labour <b>group</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> council, a post he held until his death in 1963. Bessie became honorary president of the Liverpool Trades Council and Labour Party (LTCLP), the body that had been formed in 1921 when the Liverpool Trades Council merged with the newly formed local Labour Party to form a united labour front.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, Starr {{released}} two albums on the Mercury label. The studio album Vertical Man {{marked the}} beginning of a nine-year partnership with Mark Hudson, who produced the album and, with his band the Roundheads, formed the core of the backing <b>group</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> recordings. In addition, many famous guests joined on various tracks, including Martin, Petty, McCartney and, in his final appearance on a Starr album, Harrison. Most of the songs were written by Starr and the band. Joe Walsh and the Roundheads joined Starr for his appearance on VH1 Storytellers, which was released as an album under the same name. During the show, he performed greatest hits and new songs and told anecdotes relating to them. Starr's final release for Mercury was the 1999 Christmas-themed I Wanna Be Santa Claus. The album was a commercial failure, although the record company chose not to issue it in Britain.|$|E
