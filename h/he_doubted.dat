5|$|Oppenheimer did {{important}} {{research in}} theoretical astronomy (especially {{as related to}} general relativity and nuclear theory), nuclear physics, spectroscopy, and quantum field theory, including its extension into quantum electrodynamics. The formal mathematics of relativistic quantum mechanics also attracted his attention, although <b>he</b> <b>doubted</b> its validity. His work predicted many later finds, which include the neutron, meson and neutron star.|$|E
5|$|Peter of Bruys {{admitted}} the doctrinal {{authority of the}} Gospels in their literal interpretation; the other New Testament writings {{he seems to have}} considered valueless, as <b>he</b> <b>doubted</b> their apostolic origin. He questioned the Old Testament and rejected the authority of the Church Fathers and that of the Roman Catholic Church itself. Petrobrusians also opposed clerical celibacy, infant baptism, prayers for the dead, and organ music.|$|E
5|$|Although U.S. {{copyright}} law {{would have allowed}} him to produce an unauthorized adaptation, Mansfield secured the American and British stage rights. Performing in Boston, he asked a local friend, Thomas Russell Sullivan, to write a script. Sullivan had previously only written {{in his spare time}} while working as a clerk for Lee, Higginson & Co., a Boston investment bank. Although <b>he</b> <b>doubted</b> that the novella would make a good play, he agreed to help Mansfield with the project, and they worked quickly to complete the adaptation before other, unauthorized versions could be staged.|$|E

50|$|Srinivasan {{is a young}} architect. He {{is happy}} when he gets {{a good job and}} a {{beautiful}} girlfriend, Tara. But then an accident disfigures him. Tara leaves him and Srinivasan, now sans his confidence, withdraws into his shell. Then he meets the beautiful Ragini who is willing to accept him despite his disfigurement. They get married, but after a while, <b>he</b> <b>doubts</b> the true identity of this woman. <b>He</b> <b>doubts</b> that this woman is inhuman. From there the story develops.|$|R
5|$|From 1881 on, Pedro II's health began failing. He {{gradually}} {{withdrew from}} public affairs as time passed. Weary of being {{tied to a}} throne which <b>he</b> <b>doubted</b> would survive his death, he persevered out of duty and because there seemed no immediate alternative. Nor did his daughter and heir, Isabel, exhibit a desire to assume the crown. Both, however, were overwhelmingly beloved by the Brazilian people, who still supported the monarchy. The indifference towards the Imperial system by the Emperor and his daughter allowed a discontented republican minority to grow more audacious and to eventually launch the coup that overthrew the Empire.|$|E
5|$|He was {{a member}} of the New York State Senate from 1917 to 1923. He served the 20th District in the 140th and 141st New York State Legislature and {{represented}} the 18th District in the 142nd, 143rd, 144th, 145th and 146th New York State Legislatures. In March 1918, Cotillo opposed the proposed prohibition of alcohol in the state. Although he believed in temperance, <b>he</b> <b>doubted</b> if that would be achieved by prohibition; he advocated education and not infringing on civil liberties.|$|E
5|$|On 10 May 1947, {{immediately}} after a Great Britain versus Rest of Europe match in Glasgow (Britain won 6–1), {{he made the}} move for £11,500, {{at the age of}} 32. The match itself raised £30,000 for the four Home Nations Football Associations, and since the eleven British players received £14 each, Matthews questioned where exactly this money ended up – <b>he</b> <b>doubted</b> that much of it ended up as funding for grass-roots football.|$|E

5|$|Parizeau's {{hopes for}} {{international}} recognition, a practical requirement of statehood, rested with France and the Francophonie. He {{believed that if}} Quebec declared independence in these circumstances, President of the French National Assembly Philippe Séguin, a powerful Gaullist power broker who was sympathetic to the sovereignty movement, would pressure President Chirac to recognize the declaration. He counted on a French recognition to spread quickly to the Francophonie and bring the issue to a head. Benoit Bouchard, Canada's ambassador at the time, believed that the plan was irrational as <b>he</b> <b>doubted</b> Séguin, {{who was supposed to}} be a neutral figure in his role, could bring sufficient pressure in the country's semi-presidential system.|$|E
5|$|The {{fate of the}} {{original}} letter given to Bixby is unknown. William A. Bixby, a son of Oliver, told The New York Times in an August 9, 1925 interview {{that he did not}} know what happened to the letter after his grandmother received it, though <b>he</b> <b>doubted</b> it still survived. A few days later, William's sister, Mrs. Towers told the Boston Herald that she also did not know the letter's fate but speculated Bixby may have torn it up, resenting that it incorrectly said five of her sons had been killed. William's son, Arthur March Bixby, told the New York Sun in 1949 that he recalled his father telling him that she had angrily destroyed the letter after receiving it.|$|E
5|$|When Schaefer did not {{submit to}} Parsons she called other studio heads and made more threats {{on behalf of}} Hearst to expose the private lives of people {{throughout}} the entire film industry. Welles was threatened with an exposé about his romance with the married actress Dolores del Rio, who wanted the affair kept secret until her divorce was finalized. In a statement to journalists Welles denied that the film was about Hearst. Hearst began preparing an injunction against the film for libel and invasion of privacy, but Welles's lawyer told him that <b>he</b> <b>doubted</b> Hearst would proceed due to the negative publicity and required testimony that an injunction would bring.|$|E

5|$|Cardiff City had {{previously}} reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup twice, {{and two years}} earlier in 1925, they were defeated finalists. The 1927 final was the first for Arsenal, so as a result whoever won the match would take the trophy for the first time. Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman {{held a press conference}} prior to the final on 21 April, where he announced that Horace Cope was injured and would be unable to play at left back. <b>He</b> <b>doubted</b> whether Syd Hoar or Alf Baker would be available as both of those were still recovering, and so he was leaving the selections for both the right half and outside left positions open should they become fit before the game. He saw Bill Seddon and Sam Haden as the alternatives should his first choice players not recover. When asked about who would win the game, he promised the press an answer after the match. In the end, both Baker and Hoar were named to the Arsenal team. The Arsenal team trained in Highbury on their own pitch prior to the final.|$|E
5|$|Gilberto's doctor {{ordered him}} to wear a back brace for three months to aid the healing of the {{fractured}} bone. Gilberto returned to his native Brazil {{for the duration of}} his rehabilitation. During his time there, <b>he</b> <b>doubted</b> whether he would ever be able to play football again, due to speculation that his injury could threaten his career. Despite his concerns, his long rehabilitation time paid off as he made a full recovery. He made his footballing comeback in Arsenal's 4–1 victory over Norwich City on 22 April 2005. During the whole 2004–05 season, Gilberto was injured for 7 months and played only 17 games. His absence, combined with Arsenal's slump in form at the time, led to much discussion regarding the importance of Gilberto to the Arsenal team; some suggesting that Arsenal struggled without him. Gilberto's difficult 2004–05 season ended in consolation as Arsenal finished runners-up in the Premier League and won the FA Cup against Manchester United in a penalty shoot-out.|$|E
5|$|Lygon's successor, the {{politician}} Rufus Isaacs, the Marquess of Reading, became the Lord Warden in 1934, holding jovial family gatherings there. His wife, Stella, attempted to restore Wellington's old bedroom to its earlier appearance during the Duke's tenure and, {{as part of}} this project, the 4th Duke of Wellington agreed to send the original contents of the room back to the castle, where they still remain. The politician Freeman Freeman-Thomas, the Marquess of Willingdon, became Lord Warden in 1936, followed by Sir Winston Churchill who followed him in 1941 during the Second World War. Churchill noted to the Minister of Works and Buildings that he had told King George V on taking up the position that <b>he</b> <b>doubted</b> that {{he would be able to}} live at Walmer Castle during the war, as it was within range of the German artillery along the French coast, or indeed that he would able to afford to live there afterwards, and for that reason he hoped that the state would maintain the castle and gardens, and decide what use it should be put to after the war.|$|E

5|$|He {{expressed}} {{surprise that}} a task {{as important as}} the expedition's was entrusted to such young men. Von Hentig had to convince the Emir that the mission did not consider themselves merchants, but instead brought word from the Kaiser, the Ottoman Sultan, and from India, wishing to recognise Afghanistan's complete independence and sovereignty. The Kaiser's typewritten letter, which he compared to the handsome greeting received from the Ottomans, failed to settle the Emir's suspicions; <b>he</b> <b>doubted</b> its authenticity. Von Hentig's explanation that the Kaiser had written the letter using the only instrument available at his field headquarters before the group's hurried departure may not have entirely convinced him. Passing along the Kaiser's invitation to join the war {{on the side of the}} Central Powers, von Hentig described the war situation as favourable and invited the Emir to declare independence. This was followed by a presentation from Kasim Bey explaining the Ottoman Sultan's declaration of jihad and Turkey's desire to avoid a fratricidal war between Islamic peoples. He passed along a message to Afghanistan similar to the Kaiser's. Barkatullah invited Habibullah to declare war against the British Empire and to come to the aid of India's Muslims. He proposed that the Emir should allow Turco-German forces to cross Afghanistan for a campaign towards the Indian frontier, a campaign which he hoped the Emir would join. Barkatullah and Mahendra Pratap, both eloquent speakers, pointed out the rich territorial gains the Emir stood to acquire by joining the Central Powers.|$|E
5|$|With {{crew members}} and stevedores abandoning ship, it was {{realised}} by the dock authorities {{that there was}} a problem on board Fort Stikine. A fire crew was sent on board and an order was given for more fire engines to be sent for. Due to difficulties in contacting the fire control centre, initially only two engines were sent. Those on board Fort Stikine were unable to discover the seat of the fire and water was poured blindly into the hold. With the arrival of the two fire appliances, there were now eleven hoses in use. Captain Oberst, of the Indian Army Ordnance Corps arrived a few minutes later to assess the situation. He {{was in charge of the}} explosives only after they had been landed. A meeting was held on board between the ship's officers, Oberst, and Commander Longmore of the Royal Indian Navy, the Chief Salvage Officer in Bombay. It was stated by Oberst that Fort Stikine had explosives equivalent to 150 Blockbuster bombs on board and that the ship should be scuttled. Her captain countered that the boiler room and engine room could be flooded, but <b>he</b> <b>doubted</b> that the ship would sink in that condition. More fire appliances arrived, bringing the total number of hoses in use to 32. by 14:45, ammunition in № 2 hold was exploding. Colonel Sadler, the General Manager of the docks at Bombay, was sent for. He arrived at 14:50 and suggested that Fort Stikine should be removed from the docks, which would have required the use of tugs due to Fort Stikine being disabled. An argument developed and Colonel Sadler's parting remark was that the ship would probably explode before she could be taken out of port.|$|E
