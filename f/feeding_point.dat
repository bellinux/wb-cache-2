50|$|In {{a common}} design, {{incoming}} lines have a disconnect switch and a circuit breaker. In some cases, the lines {{will not have}} both, with either a switch or a circuit breaker being all that is considered necessary. A disconnect switch is used to provide isolation, since it cannot interrupt load current. A circuit breaker {{is used as a}} protection device to interrupt fault currents automatically, and may be used to switch loads on and off, or to cut off a line when power is flowing in the 'wrong' direction. When a large fault current flows through the circuit breaker, this is detected through the use of current transformers. The magnitude of the current transformer outputs may be used to trip the circuit breaker resulting in a disconnection of the load supplied by the circuit break from the <b>feeding</b> <b>point.</b> This seeks to isolate the fault point {{from the rest of the}} system, and allow the rest of the system to continue operating with minimal impact.

When mature, the insect remains stationary, attaches {{itself to the}} plant by waxy secretions, and produces a white egg sac in grooves, by extrusion, in the body which encases hundreds of red eggs. The egg sac will grow to be {{two to three times}} as long as the body. Newly hatched nymphs are the primary dispersal stage, with dispersion known to occur by wind and by crawling. Early stage nymphs feed from the midrib veins of leaves and small twigs, and do the bulk of the damage.

Unlike many other scale insects, they retain legs and a limited mobility in all life stages. Older nymphs migrate to larger twigs and eventually as adults to branches and the trunk. Their life cycle is highly temperature dependent, as the length of time in each stage of life is longer in cold temperatures than high temperatures.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{technique}} and a nonthermal soldering method {{to improve the}} performance of AgHT- 8 transparent polymer antennas are proposed in this letter. The proposed technique involves {{the removal of the}} coating layer at areas on the coplanar waveguide (CPW) ground and feed line where the connectors of the coaxial feed or legs of the SMA connectors will be attached and applying a coat of silver paint on the exposed areas before cold-soldering the coaxial connections or SMA connector legs. The nonthermal or cold soldering using electrically conductive paste enables direct soldering of the coaxial <b>feed</b> <b>points</b> or connector legs, which cannot otherwise be done with hot or thermal soldering. This type of connection greatly enhances the performance of the AgHT- 8 polymer antennas compared to coaxial <b>feed</b> <b>point</b> connections through hot-soldered copper pads glued {{to the surface of the}} polymer coating. The proposed technique also gives a stronger connection bond than directly cold-soldering the <b>feed</b> <b>points</b> or connectors to the smooth surface of the AgHT- 8 material.

However, density dependence of demographic parameters may confound this approach. In this study we used a 25 -year data set on Bearded Vultures (Gypaetus barbatus) in Spain to evaluate the consequences of population growth on reproductive performance. Unlike its coefficient of variation (CV), mean annual productivity decreased with increasing population size. After controlling for territorial heterogeneity, productivity also was negatively related to {{the distance to the}} nearest conspecific breeding pair and to supplementary <b>feeding</b> <b>points</b> where floaters congregate. These results suggest that vulture populations are regulated as posited by the site-dependency hypothesis: as the population increases, average productivity decreases because progressively poorer territories are used.
