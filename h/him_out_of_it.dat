Washington wanted to push onto New Brunswick and capture a British pay chest of 70,000 pounds but Major Generals Henry Knox and Nathanael Greene talked <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Instead, Washington moved his army to Somerset Courthouse on the night of January 3, then marched to Pluckemin by January 5, and arrived at Morristown, by sunset the next day, for winter encampment. After the battle, Cornwallis abandoned many of his posts in New Jersey, and ordered his army to retreat to New Brunswick.|$|E
5|$|Four days later, Armstrong was {{involved}} in a second incident, when he flew for the only time with Chuck Yeager. Their job, flying a Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star, was to evaluate Smith Ranch Dry Lake for use as an emergency landing site for the X-15. In his autobiography, Yeager wrote that he knew the lake bed was unsuitable for landings after recent rains, but Armstrong insisted on flying out anyway. As they attempted a touch-and-go, the wheels became stuck and they had to wait for rescue. Armstrong tells a different version of events, where Yeager never tried to talk <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> and they made a first successful landing {{on the east side of}} the lake. Then Yeager told him to try again, this time a bit slower. On the second landing, they became stuck and according to Armstrong, Yeager was in fits of laughter.|$|E

Al-Zubayr left the battle-field while Aisha continued to direct her troops. A man named Amr ibn Jurmuz decided to track his movements and followed him to a nearby field.

25|$|Van Dorn {{ordered a}} retreat first towards Pocahontas, where he {{proposed}} for the Confederate army to attack Corinth again from the south; both Price and Maury talked <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> The retreat continued westward, with Lovell's division serving as a rearguard against Rosecrans and Price's divisions in front. On the morning of October 6, Van Dorn learned that another Union force commanded by Stephen Hulbut was approaching from the west; he assigned Maury's division to hold the Davis Bridge over the Hatchie River until the army could reach another crossing six miles to the south. Maury formed a line {{on the west side}} of the creek but the line was overrun with the loss of 300 prisoners. Hulbut then crossed several regiments to the east bank, which suffered 570 casualties, mostly due to sharpshooters and artillery fire. Once a temporary bridge was built across the Hatchie, the Confederate army retreated to Holly Springs.|$|E
25|$|In February 1942, as Japanese forces {{tightened}} {{their grip}} on the Philippines, MacArthur was ordered by President Roosevelt to relocate to Australia.

MacArthur and his party reached Del Monte Airfield in Bukidnon province {{on the island of}} Mindanao two days later. General George Marshall sent three U.S. Navy B-17s to pick them up. Two of them arrived, and brought the entire group to Australia.|$|E

25|$|Moments later, Gold asks Fiona {{to reopen}} the {{investigation}} into Belle’s disappearance. As Fiona tries to talk <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> she shows him pictures of Belle enjoying life in other countries, and wants Gold to move on from Belle. Back in the Enchanted Forest, Hook and David began their search for the magic beans and Hook finds one, only to encounter a dragon. The creature chases them down the beanstalk after they take the bean. At the hospital, Henry wakes up and discovers that Fiona is manipulating Emma during their visit. Afterwards, Fiona finally succeeds in convincing Emma to burn the storybook in the furnace as Fiona tells Emma it's {{the only way to}} keep Henry safe and to end the delusions.

However, as the book is burning, the pages flip to a picture of Hook, and Emma stares at his image as the flames consume the page.|$|E
25|$|Viki {{surprisingly}} {{manages to}} pass her theater audition, though it's obvious {{the reason for}} the sudden success is jury member Baron being taken with her attractive looks. Though she's ecstatic, Filip is not thrilled with the development and is especially unhappy about the celebrated theater actor and multiple divorcee Baron now wooing his girlfriend, with Viki even welcoming the aging lothario's smooth advances. Frustrated, Filip even contacts Ema hoping to receive some help getting through to Viki whose head is high in the clouds. For the moment at least, Giga and Ema manage to impart some rationality to their daughter, and she seems ready to take the sensible option and make nice with Filip. In parallel, in order to sweeten his case with Viki, Baron arranges for her, a complete novice, to get the demanding role of Juliet in the theater's latest production of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, while Baron plays Romeo. He tells her the big news by showing up unannounced at the apartment just as she's getting ready to go out to meet Filip for a date. The news sends her on cloud nine and she immediately puts Filip and the marriage on the back-burner while Filip's frustration grows. Soon, Baron manages to bed Viki who thus becomes his latest conquest. Though he's not aware of the gory details yet, Filip has seen enough to send him over the edge and, overcome with jealousy, he constantly interrupts their rehearsals. It all culminates in an act of madness as he breaks into Baron's apartment with a gun, threatening to kill him, but the verbose actor talks <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> using a combination of pointed eloquence and dramatic flair.|$|E
500|$|Assaults {{south of}} town were also mismanaged, which were {{supposed}} to be the main avenue of attack, and initial Union breakthroughs went unsupported. Burnside was upset by the failure of his plan and by the enormous casualties of his repeated, futile frontal assaults, and he declared that he would personally lead an assault of the IX corps. His corps commanders talked <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> but relations were strained between the commander and his subordinates. Accepting full blame, he offered to retire from the U.S. Army, but this was refused. Burnside's detractors labeled him the [...] "Butcher of Fredericksburg".|$|E
