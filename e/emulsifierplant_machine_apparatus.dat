25|$|In {{the modern}} {{production}} system, <b>machines</b> and <b>apparatuses</b> {{play an important}} role. What {{is referred to as}} capital is nothing other than these <b>machines</b> and <b>apparatuses,</b> together with materials and intermediate products consumed in the production process. Capital is the most important of factors, or one should say as important as labor. By the help of <b>machines</b> and <b>apparatuses,</b> the human being got a tremendous production capability. These <b>machines,</b> <b>apparatuses</b> and tools are classified as capital, or more precisely as durable capital, for one uses these items for many years. Their quantity is not changed at once. But the capital is not an endowment given by the nature. It is composed of goods manufactured in the production and often imported from foreign countries. In this sense, capital is internationally mobile and the result of past economic activity. The concept of capital as natural endowment distorts the real role of capital. Capital is a production power accumulated by the past investment.|$|R

The role of the designer is to create the conditions requisite for building up such a positive state of affairs.

40|$|Electrical {{discharge}} machining is a non-contact process based on thermoelectric energy between the electrode and workpiece. It is an efficient machining process to machine an advanced, difficult-to-machine material with high precision, complex shapes and high surface quality.

40|$|Abstract:- Copper has {{excellent}} {{thermal conductivity}} and is mainly applied in electrical and machinery applications, excellent workability and reproducibility, apart from these it is cheap and abundantly available metal other than good conducting metals like silver. But has poor mechanical properties such as hardness and wear resistance. Its main disadvantage is its poor resistance in aggressive environment {{which can be}} significantly enforced by the coating of ZnO. It {{is one of the}} most effective ways to protect copper components because of its ability to form Cu-Zn components which is more resistant to oxidation. Zn is very reactive with oxygen and form ZnO which is impermeable for most of the atmosphere elements, so their presences on the surface of the coating passivate the substrate from further oxidation. For this study, the effect of deposition time, coating thickness and microstructure of Zinc coatings on Copper substrates by friction surfacing process using a Vertical Milling <b>Machine</b> <b>apparatus,</b> was investigated. The effects of longitudinal feed on the geometry and mechanical properties of coatings are studied. Metallurgical studies were made using optical microscopy...|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} this project {{performed}} in conjunction with Messrs. Degussa at Frankfurt/Main are ZrO_ 2 -ceramics of the TZP-structure for the following applications: components in <b>machines,</b> <b>apparatus,</b> instruments and tools for the industrial cutting of paper and plastic materials. The aim was the manufacturing of improved materials with an economic fabrication proccess from new powders developed by Degussa. This powder had to be compared with commercially available powders for TZP-ceramics. The first aim was missed, as the Degussa process technique could not be optimized as necessary. Nevertheless the result achieved with the commercial powders, on which the research programme had to be concentrated, are important. None of these powders was suitable which is required by industry for critical applications. Some few powders were well suited for ceramic cutting tools. They lead to the demanded material properties but still are very expensive. They allow an economic manufacture only on condition that the technical use will justify the high price. (orig.)
