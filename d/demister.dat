25|$|The Passarell process uses reduced {{atmospheric}} pressure rather than heat to drive evaporative desalination. The pure water vapor generated by distillation is then compressed and condensed using an advanced compressor. The compression process improves distillation efficiency by creating the reduced {{pressure in the}} evaporation chamber. The compressor centrifuges the pure water vapor after it is drawn through a <b>demister</b> (removing residual impurities) causing it to compress against tubes in the collection chamber. The compression of the vapor increases its temperature. The heat is transferred to the input water falling in the tubes, vaporizing {{the water in the}} tubes. Water vapor condenses {{on the outside of the}} tubes as product water. By combining several physical processes, Passarell enables most of the system's energy to be recycled through its evaporation, demisting, vapor compression, condensation, and water movement processes.|$|E

Each tank was designed {{with its own}} ventilation system to purge radiolytic hydrogen and oxygen from the tank. This design induced water removal and necessitated the additional requirement of entraining radioactivity from the exiting system {{by the use of}} <b>demisters</b> and HEPA filters. Up until the 19802 ̆ 7 s this was a sufficient method, via the hydrofracture process, of disposing the liquid nuclear waste. However since then, this method has been terminated and the tanks are nearing capacity. In the transfer of the liquid waste to the holding tanks, large amounts of water are used to prevent line clogging and solid build up in the pipes. Utilizing the existing system, this thesis proposes the idea of sparging air into the liquid waste and increasing the tank temperature in order to eliminate excess water. Parameters such as increasing the sparging air temperature, and dehumidifying and eliminating carbon dioxide from the sparging air, are investigated theoretically and experimentally in small scale experiments. In addition, the effects of vapor pressure lowering and its simultaneous effect on the evaporation rate are investigated through the activity coefficient of sodium nitrate, the major component of the liquid waste.

40|$|Recently, {{studies have}} {{appeared}} {{pointing out that}} aerosols can dominate the total amine emission from amine based PCCC pilot plant scale installations. For the design of countermeasure types (upstream or downstream of the PCCC installation), {{it is crucial to}} have an idea of the aerosol size distribution and numbers entering or leaving the absorber. This study is the first to present this kind of data and should serve future installations when designing aerosol emission countermeasures. H 2 SO 4 aerosols entering the absorber are observed to be extremely small (i. e. < 0. 2 μm) with number concentrations exceeding 1 E 8 cm- 3. The aerosols grow in size as they travel through the absorber through the taking up of water and amine to sizes close to but staying below 1 μm. However, despite {{the fact that most of}} the aerosols (expressed in number concentrations) are well below 1 μm, most of the water (and thus amine) is found in the aerosol sizes between 0. 5 and 2 μm. Therefore, if one aims at designing efficient countermeasures, eliminating this size fraction is crucial. This amine emission stream is therefore very difficult to remove using water washes as aerosols are known to travel through water wash sections. Moreover, also classical <b>demisters</b> show very little efficiency for these small aerosol sizes and are therefore believed not to be suitable for the removal of aerosols. This information will therefore serve future installations when designing aerosol emission countermeasures. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Mist eliminators (also called droplet eliminators, droplet {{separators}} or <b>demisters)</b> are {{devices that}} can remove liquid droplets from a gas flow. The gas flow laden with droplets {{is forced to}} pass through different channels, changing direction in a repetitive manner. Wave-plate (or vane type) eliminator are widely employed in chemical and industrial processes involving gas and vapour flows where mist removal is necessary for several reasons. For instance, {{one of the most}} important objectives is to restrict pollutant emission into the environment, as in cooling towers applications. Wave-plate mist eliminators can operate in vertical and horizontal situations, but in both cases, the removal of liquid droplets occurs mainly by inertial impaction. In cooling towers, spraying water is distributed over a heat transfer surface across or through which a stream of air is passing. Thus, water droplets can be captured by the stream of air and they will be carried out of the system. This phenomenon is known as drift. In countries with warm climate, inside the cooling towers the conditions of high temperature and humidity can strongly induce the spreading of pathogens agents, especially the Legionella pneumophila. The main disadvantage of installing mist (i. e., drift) eliminators is an increased pressure loss of the airflow. High-pressure loss contributes to lower flow rate of air or higher engine power of the ventilators. This fact leads to obtain lower overall efficiency values for the air-conditioning systems. Since a lack of systematic studies on comparative evaluation of morphologically similar separators has been detected, the behaviour of four wave-type eliminators having a similar geometry is studied. Both droplet collection efficiency and the pressure drop coefficient are calculated. Special emphasis is made on the validation of the numerical model with results taken from the literature, the study of the effects of relevant parameters, and the achievement of a procedure to evaluate the overall efficiency of each regarded type of eliminator. The obtained results may contribute to improve the passive droplets restraint systems in mechanical cooling towers, increasing the overall operation of the cooling tower on one side, and lowering their environmental impact on the other...|$|R
40|$|This report {{documents}} the design, assembly, {{and operation of}} a Pilot-Scale Evaporator built and operated by SRTC in support of Waste Treatment Plant (WTP) Project at the DOE's Hanford Site. The WTP employs three identical evaporators, two for the Waste Feed {{and one for the}} Treated LAW. The Pilot-Scale Evaporator was designed to test simulants for both of these waste streams. The Pilot-Scale Evaporator is 1 / 76 th scale in terms of evaporation rates. The basic configuration of forced circulation vacuum evaporator was employed. A detailed scaling analysis was performed to preserve key operating parameters such as basic loop configuration, system vacuum, boiling temperature, recirculation rates, vertical distances between important hardware pieces, reboiler heat transfer characteristics, vapor flux, configuration of <b>demisters</b> and water spray rings. Three evaporation test campaigns were completed. The first evaporation run used water in order to shake down the system. The water runs were important in identifying a design flaw that inhibited mixing in the evaporator vessel, thus resulting in unstable boiling operation. As a result the loop configuration was modified and the remaining runs were completed successfully. Two simulant runs followed the water runs. Test 1 : Simulated Ultrafiltration Recycles with HLW SBS, and Test 2 : Treated AN 102 with Envelop C LAW. Several liquid and offgas samples were drawn from the evaporator facility for regulatory and non-regulatory analyses. During Test 2, the feed and the concentrate were spiked with organics to determine organic partitioning. The decontamination factor (DF) for Test 1 was measured to be 110, 000 (more than the expected value of 100, 000). Dow Corning Q 2 - 3183 A antifoam agent was tested during both Tests 1 and 2. It was determined that 500 ppm of this antifoam agent was sufficient to control the foaminess to less than 5 per cent of the liquid height. The long-term testing (around 100 hours of operation) did not show any fouling of reboiler or other loop piping. The Pilot-Scale Evaporator will be used in the Semi-Integrated Pilot Plant tests.

40|$|Amine-based absorption-desorption {{processes}} {{are considered to}} be the state-of-the-art technology for CO 2 capture. However, the typical amines used are susceptible to oxidative and thermal degradation. Ammonia is formed as a result of oxidative solvent degradation. Because of the volatility of ammonia, significant emissions of ammonia can occur. Emission countermeasures such as water washing and use of <b>demisters</b> are ineffective against highly volatile components such as ammonia. The aim {{of this study is to}} demonstrate acid washing as a countermeasure for ammonia emissions. The tests were carried out at TNO's CO 2 capture plant at Maasvlakte, The Netherlands. Aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA, 30 wt %) was used as the absorption liquid. Typical ammonia emissions at the water wash outlet were in the range of 15 - 20 mg/Nm 3, as measured by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. An acid wash scrubber using sulfuric acid was installed downstream of the water wash. Parametric tests based on changing the pH and flow rate of the acid liquid and the temperature of the treated flue gas were performed to assess the efficiency of the acid wash scrubber. Additional ammonia (up to 150 mg/Nm 3) was spiked in the treated flue gas to test the acid wash scrubber, even under extreme conditions. The results from the experiments were compared with a model made in Aspen Plus. The experimental results indicated that it was possible to reduce ammonia emissions below 5 mg/Nm 3 at a pH of 6 for both spiking and nonspiking experiments. The modeling results were in good agreement with the experimentally measured ammonia emissions. The breakthrough of ammonia capture, defined as less than 20 % capture efficiency, was found to be at lower pH, 6. 8 for nonspiking experiments and 8. 1 for spiking experiments, than for the model, which predicted breakthrough at pH 8. 7 for nonspiking experiments and 9. 7 for spiking experiments. Changes in the acid liquid and treated flue gas temperature did not have an impact on the capture of ammonia. MEA emissions were also below 3 mg/Nm 3 at the acid wash scrubber outlet. It is estimated that the purchased equipment cost of an acid wash is about € 3. 75 million for an 800 -MWe-scale postcombustion CO 2 capture plant. © 2014 American Chemical Society...|$|R
