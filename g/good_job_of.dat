Initially, Cafferty was only hired to write a few songs for the film, but he did such a <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> capturing the feeling of the 1960s and 1980s that Davidson asked him to score the entire film.|$|E
25|$|In 1993 Noda {{joined the}} TOM'S {{team in a}} Reynard 93D Cosworth, and {{although}} like in 1992 he failed to score any points, he managed to qualify in the top 20 a few times. He also did a <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> bringing the car home, a highlight being ninth at Pau. In Noda's third season in F3000, he switched to the Forti Corse team to drive a Reynard 94D Cosworth as teammate to Pedro Diniz.|$|E
25|$|One of five {{problems}} can prevent a fire from lighting properly: wet wood, wet weather, too little tinder, too much wind, or {{a lack of}} oxygen. Rain will douse a fire, but a combination of wind and fog also has a stifling effect. Metal fire rings generally do a <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> keeping out wind, but some of them are so high as to impede the circulation of oxygen in a small fire. To make matters worse, these tall fire rings also make it very difficult to blow on the fire properly.|$|E

However he says he was advised to put a more upbeat ending.|$|R
25|$|The actual {{ratios of}} fusion to Bremsstrahlung power {{will likely be}} {{significantly}} lower for several reasons. For one, the calculation assumes that {{the energy of the}} fusion products is transmitted completely to the fuel ions, which then lose energy to the electrons by collisions, which in turn lose energy by Bremsstrahlung. However, because the fusion products move much faster than the fuel ions, they will give up a significant fraction of their energy directly to the electrons. Secondly, the ions in the plasma are assumed to be purely fuel ions. In practice, there will be a significant proportion of impurity ions, which will then lower the ratio. In particular, the fusion products themselves must remain in the plasma until they have given up their energy, and will remain some time after that in any proposed confinement scheme. Finally, all channels of energy loss other than Bremsstrahlung have been neglected. The last two factors are related. On theoretical and experimental grounds, particle and energy confinement seem to be closely related. In a confinement scheme that does a <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> retaining energy, fusion products will build up. If the fusion products are efficiently ejected, then energy confinement will be poor, too.|$|E
25|$|The Arkansas State Military Board was {{responsible}} for authorizing and designating regiments of volunteers. The board did a reasonably <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> sequencing the unit designations {{through much of the}} war; however the Confederate War Department at Richmond tended to designate new regiments based upon when the muster rolls were received. Another reason for dual designations was administrative. In the case of the 35th Arkansas, it is a little more convoluted. Earlier, Col. George W. King's south Arkansas regiment had been designated by the State Military Board as the 22nd Arkansas. Since the rolls for the 20th Arkansas had not yet arrived at Richmond, the War Department assumed that Arkansas had skipped that number, so G. W. King's 22nd Arkansas was designated by the Confederate War Department as the 20th Arkansas. By the time the reorganized muster rolls of Col. James P. King's 35th Arkansas arrive in Richmond, the War Department noticed that the designation 22nd Arkansas wasn't being used (due to their previous error), so J. P. King's regiment was re-designated at the 22nd Arkansas. Colonel Henry J McCord assumed command of the 35th Arkansas Infantry on December 2, 1863, the re-disgnation of the 35th Arkansas to the 22nd Arkansas appears to have been effective {{at the same time that}} Colonel McCord assumed command.|$|E
25|$|The {{influence}} of Congress on the presidency has varied from period to period depending on {{factors such as}} congressional leadership, presidential political influence, historical circumstances such as war, and individual initiative by members of Congress. The impeachment of Andrew Johnson made the presidency less powerful than Congress for a considerable period afterwards. The 20th and 21st centuries have seen the rise of presidential power under politicians such as Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George W. Bush. However, in recent years, Congress has restricted presidential power with laws such as the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 and the War Powers Resolution. Nevertheless, the Presidency remains considerably more powerful today than during the 19th century. Executive branch officials are often loath to reveal sensitive information to members of Congress because of concern that information could not be kept secret; in return, knowing they {{may be in the}} dark about executive branch activity, congressional officials are more likely to distrust their counterparts in executive agencies. Many government actions require fast coordinated effort by many agencies, and this is a task that Congress is ill-suited for. Congress is slow, open, divided, and not well matched to handle more rapid executive action or do a <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> overseeing such activity, according to one analysis.|$|E

5000|$|Instruction selection: Most architectures, {{particularly}} CISC architectures {{and those}} with many addressing modes, offer several different ways of performing a particular operation, using entirely different sequences <b>of</b> instructions. The <b>job</b> <b>of</b> the instruction selector is to do a <b>good</b> <b>job</b> overall <b>of</b> choosing which instructions to implement which operators in the low-level intermediate representation with. For example, on many processors in the 68000 family and on the x86 architecture, complex addressing modes {{can be used in}} statements like [...] "lea 25(a1,d5*4), a0", allowing a single instruction to perform a significant amount of arithmetic with less storage.|$|R

Although Metro David Jenkins found its creatures' design [...] "uninspired", the game's overall graphics were decent. According to gamesTM reviewers, Housemarque did not do a <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> combining two gameplay elements—the incremental loot system (accomplished through grinding) and the gameplay mechanic in which players repeat stages to increase scores—resulting in a [...] "gameplay cycle that doesn’t match the purity or compulsion of either".|$|E

50|$|The {{low scores}} were {{attributed}} to major concerns about basic supervision, management and leadership within the agency.

500|$|In The Curse of Monkey Island, Elaine realises that Guybrush is {{her true}} love, and marries him. However, Ron Gilbert {{did not intend}} for the {{relationship}} between the characters to develop in this way, stating that Elaine [...] "never really liked Guybrush and thought of him as more of a little brother". Gilbert was not involved in the production of The Curse of Monkey Island; while thinking that the new development team [...] "did a pretty <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> capturing [...] what Monkey Island was about", the relationship between Elaine and Guybrush [...] "was the thing that bugged [...] the most about The Curse of Monkey Island".|$|E

500|$|Despite the {{critical}} success, the third season of Parks and Recreation continued to suffer in the Nielsen ratings, {{just as it}} had during the second season. The average viewership for the 16 episodes of season three were 4.75 million household viewers, a slight increase over season two's 4.68 million average, but lower than season one's average of 5.45 million households. Michael Schur partially attributed the continually low viewership to a decline in ratings for NBC in general, as well as changing viewer trends due to a large amount of available channels. He added: [...] "I would love it if our ratings went up and up, and we've done a pretty <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> making our show inviting and friendly, welcoming to new viewers. Other than that, I'm not sure what else we can do. It’s very disconcerting." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the series}} progressed during its {{broadcast}} season, the writers received frequent notes and directives from Fox network executives calling for increases and decreases in the science-fiction, comedy and traditional Western elements. Cuse said, [...] "I {{think we did}} a particularly <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> maintaining continuity with all the schizophrenic notes we were getting from the network." [...] However, midway through the first season, the writers made a thematic shift from science-fiction to more comedy and adventure. Cuse said, [...] "We were biting off more than we could chew... {{we were trying to}} do a comedic action adventure Western, with tongue-in-cheek humor, genuine drama, plus science fiction. All these things added too many elements to serve simultaneously." [...] By the final third of the series, the writers had wrapped up the science-fiction plot with the Orb and focused more on traditional Western motifs.|$|E
500|$|The first segment, [...] "The Devil and Homer Simpson", {{was written}} by Daniels and McGrath. The first time Devil Flanders appears, he looks {{the same as the}} devil Chernabog from the 1940 Walt Disney {{produced}} film Fantasia; Silverman particularly admired the animation in that sequence. Oakley loved the idea of Flanders being the Devil because he is the one you would least expect. He also thought Harry Shearer did a <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> playing Flanders in a much darker way, while remaining very true to the character. Many scenes had to be cut to shorten the segment, including one that showed Homer's severed head being used as a bowling ball by a demon in hell. This scene later appeared in the clip show episode [...] "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular", which aired in the show's seventh season.|$|E
