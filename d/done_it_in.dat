Shevchenko made Champions League history the following season; on 23 November 2005, he scored all four goals in Milan's 4–0 group stage drubbing of Fenerbahçe, becoming only the fifth player to accomplish this feat; his company includes Marco van Basten, Simone Inzaghi, Dado Pršo and Ruud van Nistelrooy (while Lionel Messi joined that group in the 2009–10 season and Robert Lewandowski in 2012–13), {{and the only one}} to have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> an away game. Milan eventually lost the tournament when Shevchenko missed the crucial penalty in the final against Liverpool. In the 2005–06 season, he scored his last Milan goal in the second leg of the quarter-finals as they eliminated Lyon after a last-minute comeback in a 3–1 victory. In the semi-finals, Milan lost to eventual winners Barcelona 1–0, a match where Shevchenko controversially had a last minute equalizer denied by the referee. Despite this, he still ended up being the top scorer of the whole competition with 9 goals in 12 games.|$|E

500|$|Although the Association {{unveiled}} the completed head of Lee on January 19, 1924 (the general's birthday), within months, {{its relations with}} Borglum had become strained. [...] Technical problems over the medal and {{the work on the}} mountain caused tensions, and political differences between Borglum, a Republican, and Randolph, an active Democrat, led to poor relations between the two. [...] Borglum, Venable, and Randolph backed different KKK members for national leadership. [...] Both Borglum and the Association accused each other of graft; the sculptor proposed that he form a syndicate to purchase the half dollars from the Mint and sell them with the profits to be applied directly to construction costs. [...] Randolph ridiculed the suggestion, stating that it would allow Borglum to carve [...] "whatever he pleased on the mountain". [...] Borglum accused Randolph of using donations for his own benefit, and spending freely on an expense account. These dissensions became public, and in February 1925, the Association fired Borglum. [...] Randolph stated, as one reason for dismissing the sculptor, that Borglum had taken seven months to design the coin, when, he said, any competent artist could have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> three weeks. [...] He accused Borglum of delaying so that the Association would be embarrassed. According to Freeman, [...] "despite all the points of conflict between Borglum and the committee, it was actually the commemorative coin that ended his career at Stone Mountain." ...|$|E

[...] On the location for a third season, Fazekas stated that moving the series to London had been a possibility, an idea that creators Markus and McFeely had early on. Fazekas added, [...] "you can put the show anywhere, because it's spies. [...] all going to be determined by what story we want to tell. I loved [...] I loved how it looked, I loved how it looked on Peggy. We would be very happy to do another L.A. season, but we're not married to it." [...] Fazekas also said that seeds for a third season had been planted all throughout the second, and {{that the end of the}} second season, with someone shooting Thompson and taking the M. Carter file, was [...] "very much tied to a third season arc", with the shooter and their reason for taking the file already determined. Atwell added that the third season would have gone [...] "further back into [...] past” while having [...] "a possible kind of twist... into something to do with [...] family." [...] She also added that more insight would have been provided on Carter's brother, Michael.|$|E
500|$|Cher's {{music plays}} {{a large role}} in [...] "The Post-Modern Prometheus", Chris Carter having written the episode after {{spending}} a summer listening to Cher records and developing a fixation on the singer. Carter knew that Cher's half-sister Georganne LaPiere was a major X-Files fan, and Carter learned through LaPiere that Cher herself was intrigued by the show and would be interested in making an X-Files guest appearance. Sitcom star Roseanne Barr also expressed an interest in guesting on The X-Files, and Carter wrote the part of Shaineh Berkowitz specifically for her. Barr, however, was unavailable at the time of shooting—her projected role was filled by Pattie Tierce— while Cher passed on the proffered cameo appearance performing as herself, a decision for which she later expressed regret: [...] "I wanted them to ask me to come on and act—then they just wanted me to come on and sing ... Just to come on and be myself wasn't anything I'd want to do until I saw [...] " [...] — [...] "Had I [...] the quality of [...] I would have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a heartbeat." [...] Cher did authorize the use of three of her tracks on the episode's soundtrack including [...] "Walking in Memphis" [...] heard at the episode's conclusion while ostensibly performed onstage by celebrity impersonator Tracey Bell—filmed in longshot or from the back or overheard—as Cher. Although Bell was credited for the role, Cher's fans responded to the episode's premiere with online speculation as to whether the singer had pseudonymously appeared in the episode. [...] Tabloid talk show host Jerry Springer appeared as himself. These casting choices went against a long-standing tradition on The X-Files of only casting actors who were not well-known.|$|E

500|$|After a brief {{run as a}} {{face that}} saw him {{defeating}} Chris Benoit at No Mercy, Triple H reverted to his heel persona and restarted his feud with Stone Cold Steve Austin when it emerged that Triple H had paid off Rikishi to run down Austin at Survivor Series, causing {{him to take a}} year off. While in the storyline Triple H said he had <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> order to shield Austin from the WWF Championship and end his career, in reality Austin's previous neck injuries started bothering him again, forcing him to have surgery. In November 2000, Triple H and Austin had a match at Survivor Series that ended when Triple H tried to trick Austin into coming into the parking lot to run him over again, only to have Austin lift his car up with a forklift and flip the car onto its roof 10feet high. Triple H returned a few weeks later to attack Austin, and their feud continued into 2001 and ended in a Three Stages of Hell match in which Triple H defeated Austin. In 2001, Triple H also feuded with The Undertaker, who defeated him at WrestleMania X-Seven. The night after WrestleMania, Triple H interfered in a steel cage match between Austin (who had just won the WWF Championship) and The Rock where he joined forces with Austin and double teamed on The Rock, forming a tag team called The Two-Man Power Trip. Triple H then defeated Chris Jericho for his third Intercontinental Championship on the April 5 SmackDown!, and won it for a fourth time two weeks later by defeating Jeff Hardy. Triple H then became a world tag team champion by winning the WWF Tag Team Championship {{for the first time at}} Backlash when he and Austin defeated Kane and The Undertaker in a [...] "Winner Take All" [...] tag team match. As Triple H was still Intercontinental Champion, the win made him a double champion.|$|E

This was the second time Mankad had dismissed Brown in this fashion on the tour, having already <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> an earlier match against an Australian XI. On that occasion he had warned Brown once before running him out.
