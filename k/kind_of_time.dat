The two methods {{are used for}} short-term time-varying system parameter identification in simulations.

The results of the simulations indicate the effectiveness of the two methods. Furthermore whether the two <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> identification methods are sensitive to noise or not is studied by setting different noise levels in the simulations. Finally, experiments of a variable mass cylindrical shell are adopted to demonstrate the efficiency <b>of</b> the two <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> varying parameter identification methods. ...|$|R

His affair with Bessie Lynde had given him a certain note, and an adventurous young matron, who was naturally a little indiscriminate, might very well have been willing to let him go about with her party. She could not know how impudent his mere presence was with reference to Bessie, and the girl herself made no sign that could have enlightened her. She accepted something more that her share of his general usefulness to the party; she danced with him whenever he asked her, and she seemed not to scruple to publish her affair with him in the openest manner.

What the papers gathered here also show is that this handy linking into one term is, if useful and important, also, in some ways, a chaotic conceptualisation.
