40|$|To {{simulate}} {{the bow of}} wafers with <b>integrated</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{in the form of}} pit arrays, various approaches were pursued. After unfruitful attempts to reliably obtain the wafer bow directly from simulating part of the wafer, a multi-scale approach was used. In this approach, the layer with the <b>integrated</b> <b>capacitors</b> was replaced by a homogeneous material having the same properties. Small-scale simulations of representative parts of the layer were performed to determine its effective stiffness tensor. Inclusion of the intrinsic strains of the grown and deposited dielectric and conductive layers enabled the volume change to be calculated of the layer with the <b>integrated</b> <b>capacitors</b> upon fabrication. Finally, the structure obtained was used in a full-wafer-scale model to {{simulate the}} bow of the wafers.

40|$|The {{mammalian}} cochlea, {{the organ}} responsible for hearing, achieves remarkable acoustic transduction characteristics {{in a very}} compact design. The mechanics of the fluid-structure interaction within the cochlea create a sensitive real time frequency analyzer. Our work focuses on producing an acoustic sensor which uses processes inspired by {{those found in the}} cochlea. Two designs using microscle fluid-structure interaction are presented: a single-channel sensor and a multi-channel sensor. The single channel sensor uses a fluid-filled microchamber to direct acoustic energy from an array of radially located input membranes to a central sensing membrane. This geometry results in up to 26 dB of mechanical displacement amplification. An integrated capacitive sensing scheme is used to measure the displacement. In-air measurements show sensitivities of- 200 dB re 1 V / Pa in a 15 kHz band, with 9 V applied bias and a 10 pF <b>integrating</b> <b>capacitor.</b> The multichannel device directly mimics the action of the passive cochlea by setting up a fluid-structure traveling wave in a variable impedance acoustic waveguide.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this Master Thesis is {{the design of a}} 12 -bit 500 Ms/s {{standalone}} charge redistribution Digital-to-Analog Converter. Digital-to-Analog Converters with very high analog bandwidth are mostly built with unitary and binary weighted current sources. Their performance is limited by the matching precision of these current sources. A new type of converter based on charge redistribution can easily be operated at very high sampling rates and is built with <b>integrated</b> <b>capacitors.</b> The matching accuracy of <b>integrated</b> <b>capacitors</b> is excellent. The charge redistribution Digital-to-Analog Converter already shows fast and pretty linear settling but used as a standalone Digital-to-Analog Converter it must show a perfect ‘hold’ function and glitches between consecutive samples must be very small. In this report several possible architectures are presented that incorporate these features. Reducing the glitches and still keeping the total capacitance low are the important aspects that contributed to the choice of thermometer coding the four MSB bits and implementing the next eight bits in a binary weighted architecture with a split array. Calculations and simulations show that this architecture achieves the required matching accuracy and reduction of glitches with acceptable total capacitance. The static performance is measured and the Differential Nonlinearity (DNL) and Integral Nonlinearity (INL) are within ±½LSB so monotonicity is guaranteed. The dynamic performance measured in the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is close to the theoretical value of 74 dB. Overall it can be concluded that the architecture presented in this report is suitable for the specified requirements; 12 bits resolution at a clock frequency of 500 Ms/s with reasonable total capacitance. Future work should include further improvements in the linearity of the settling behavior, the cleaning up of the supply voltage and the design of an output buffer...|$|R
