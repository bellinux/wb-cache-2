Opinion polls of contenders for the Democratic nomination showed Gravel with 1percent or less support.

5|$|The Battle of the Netherlands {{commenced}} on 10 May 1940. While initial {{air operations}} went well, and the German fighters and bombers soon gained the upper <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> the small Dutch air force, the paratroopers ran into fierce {{opposition in the}} Battle for The Hague and the Battle of Rotterdam. On 14 May 1940, responding to a call for assistance from Student, Kesselring ordered the bombing of Rotterdam city centre. Fires raged out of control, destroying much of the city.|$|E
5|$|Edward now {{seized the}} initiative, and moved northwards. Lancaster convened one final meeting at Doncaster in November, and also entered into an {{alliance}} with Robert I of Scotland to strengthen his <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> the King. In January 1322 Edward crossed the River Severn, and secured the surrender {{of several of the}} marcher lords while Lancaster remained passive. As the royal army crossed the River Trent after the Battle of Burton Bridge, Lancaster was forced to flee north. On 16 March Lancaster and his army had reached Boroughbridge by the River Ure where they were joined by the Earl's Secretary Sir Robert de Holland and the force he had raised in Lancashire. There they were cut off by the forces of Sir Andrew Harclay, a veteran from the Scottish wars, who had gathered the levies from the counties of Cumberland and Westmorland.|$|E

5|$|Khal Drogo's khalasar {{arrives at}} the city of Vaes Dothrak. Viserys Targaryen impatiently waits for the army Drogo agreed to lend him, the bride price offered for his sister Daenerys, to reconquer the Seven Kingdoms. When Viserys misinterprets Daenerys's {{invitation}} to dinner as an order, he becomes angry and strikes her. For the first time, Daenerys fights back, hitting her astounded brother and promising that if he raises a <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> her again, his hands will be cut off. Later, the banished knight Jorah Mormont tells her that Viserys {{would not be a}} good leader for the invasion of Westeros and, despite what Viserys believes, the people of the Seven Kingdoms do not care who rules them {{as long as they are}} ruled well. Daenerys agrees that Viserys could not conquer the Seven Kingdoms even if Khal Drogo gave him an entire army.|$|E

In the next match against Tamil Nadu at Chennai, he scored a mammoth 269, and struck a 353-run partnership with Jaydev Shah (195) to post a score of 581/6 in response to Tamil Nadu's 565.|$|E
25|$|Fondy jammed {{his left}} <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> Cincinnati in July 1954 and missed several games. X-rays proved negative. During spring {{training}} in 1955 Fondy {{went on a}} tear of 13 hits in 16 times at bat. He knocked in 7 runs {{with a couple of}} home runs versus the San Antonio Missions on April 2. He hit his 5th home run of 1956 in the 10th inning of a July 19 game with Philadelphia. It earned Chicago a 4–3 victory.|$|E
60|$|Bearing this in mind, {{and seeing}} that sectionalism has since arisen upon this same subject, is that warning {{a weapon in}} your <b>hands</b> <b>against</b> us, or in our <b>hands</b> <b>against</b> you? Could Washington himself speak, would he cast the blame of that sectionalism upon us, who sustain his policy, or upon you, who {{repudiate}} it? We respect that warning of Washington, and we commend it to you, together with his example pointing to the right application of it.|$|R

25|$|There was a {{chasm between}} the official, {{communist}} culture and genuine culture. On the one <b>hand,</b> <b>against</b> the authorities intentions, the outstanding works {{were perceived as}} a realm of moral truths and the significant representatives of genuine cultural achievement were held in very high esteem by the public opinion. On the other hand, the slogans disseminated nationwide through the forms of official culture helped spread simplistic views, which were relatively successful among some ranks of the population. The tension between these two directions can still be perceived {{at the level of}} society as a whole.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the siege, Sauron {{finally came}} forth and fought hand-to <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> Gil-galad and Elendil on the slopes of Mount Doom, but the Dark Lord proved too strong and slew them both. A record left by Isildur in Minas Tirith implies that Sauron himself slew Gil-galad with the heat of his bare hands. Recalling the {{encounter}} at the great Council at Rivendell before the Fellowship took the One Ring south, Elrond said that only he and Círdan stood by Gil-galad in that last mortal contest.|$|E
25|$|Blackburne's match {{results are}} weaker. He was twice soundly beat by Steinitz, in 1862/3 (+1−7=2) and 1876 (+0−7=0); but in 1862 Blackburne {{had been playing}} chess for barely 3 years, and in 1876 Steinitz was playing at his {{life-time}} best {{and in the middle}} of a 24-game winning streak. Emanuel Lasker beat Blackburne in 1892, but Lasker also beat Steinitz very decisively in their 1894 championship match. Blackburne was also comfortably beaten in 1881 by Zukertort (+2−7=5), who was in great form at the time; and Zukertort's health and play were declining rapidly when Blackburne beat him in 1887 (+5−1=7). On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>against</b> Gunsberg, Blackburne won his 1881 match (+7−4=3) and lost his 1887 match (+2−5=6); the 1887 match was Gunsberg's strongest performance, and Gunsberg only narrowly lost a world title match against Steinitz in 1890 (+6−4=9).|$|E

25|$|The drum {{is usually}} {{played in a}} seated position, held {{vertically}} on the player's thigh and supported {{by his or her}} upper body and arm (usually on the left side, for a right-handed player), with the hand placed {{on the inside of the}} skin where it is able to control the tension (and therefore the pitch and timbre) by applying varying amounts of pressure and also the amount of surface area being played, with the back of the <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> the crossbar, if present. The drum is struck with the other arm (usually the right) and is played either with the bare hand or with a tipper. There are numerous playing styles, mostly named after the region of Ireland in which they originated. The most common is Kerry style, which uses a two-headed tipper; the West Limerick style uses only one end of the tipper.|$|E
25|$|If {{the match}} is not ended by a fall, {{technical}} fall, default, or disqualification, the referee then prepares both wrestlers {{to begin the}} second period. After the first period ends, one wrestler will have the choice of starting position in the second period. In dual meets, this {{is determined by the}} colored disk toss that took place before the meet began. In tournaments, the referee will toss a colored disk, with a green-colored side and a red-colored side, and the winner of that disk toss will have the choice of position. The wrestler could choose between the neutral position, or as is most commonly chosen to begin in a place called the referee's position on the mat. The referee's position has both wrestlers beginning action {{at the center of the}} mat with one wrestler (in the defensive starting position) on the bottom with his hands spread apart in front of the forward starting line and his knees spread apart behind the rear starting line with his legs held together. The other wrestler on the top (in the offensive starting position) then kneels beside him with one arm wrapped around the bottom wrestler's waist (with the palm of his <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> the opponent's navel) and the other hand on or over the back of the opponent's near elbow for control. Most often, the wrestler with the choice chooses the defensive (bottom) position because of the relative ease of scoring an escape or reversal in comparison to a near fall. The wrestler could also defer his choice to the beginning of the third period.|$|E
500|$|The {{account of}} Theophanes Continuatus on Thomas's revolt states {{that in this}} time, [...] "the servant raised his <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> his master, the soldier against his officer, the captain against his general". This has led some scholars, chiefly Alexander Vasiliev and George Ostrogorsky, to regard Thomas's revolt as an {{expression}} of widespread discontent among the rural population, which suffered under heavy taxation. Other Byzantinists, notably Lemerle, dismiss rural discontent as a primary factor during the revolt.|$|E

500|$|Vittoria's {{theme is}} also used (with little development) as {{the subject of the}} fugue. This section is in [...] time (three {{crochets}} to a bar) and is marked [...] "Andante con moto" [...] ("at a walking pace, with movement"). The fugue, which is mainly in four-part writing with frequent rhythmic changes, gradually builds to a climax. In bar 69, a new louder melody is added in the right <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> the fugue theme in the pedals. Gradually, the piece dies away to two parts and ppp (pianississimo, [...] "very, very quietly") as the left and right hands play the fugue theme a bar apart from each other, in canon. The whole piece lasts about five minutes.|$|E
500|$|Suter's tenure {{with the}} Whalers lasted only one day, as Hartford {{immediately}} dealt {{him to the}} Chicago Blackhawks along with Randy Cunneyworth and a draft pick for Frantisek Kucera and Jocelyn Lemieux. Suter appeared in 16 regular season games with the Blackhawks, finishing the season with 41 games played and 18 points combined between Calgary and Chicago. He quickly established a place alongside Chris Chelios as the team's top defensive pair. [...] In his first full season in Chicago, Suter was looked upon {{to serve as a}} team leader and played a key role with the team's power play. He appeared in all 48 games of the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season, scoring 37 points, but missed several playoff games after suffering a broken <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> the Vancouver Canucks.|$|E
500|$|Between 4:00pm and 5:00am the {{following}} day, the Polish 10th Armored Division, Polish 19th Armored Division, Polish 4th Infantry Division and Polish 5th Infantry Division, totaling about 10,300troops and the Internal Security Corps {{under the command}} of Poplavsky entered Poznań. A two-hour long procession of tanks, armored cars, field guns, and lorries full of troops went through the city and surrounded it. At 9:00pm a wave of detentions began. The detainees were taken to Ławica airport, where they were subjected to brutal interrogation; 746persons were detained until August8. The protests continued until June30, when the troops finally pacified the city, after exchanging fire with some violent demonstrators. At 7:30am on June29 the Prime Minister arrived and infamously declared on the local radio station that [...] "any provocateur or lunatic who raises his <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> the people's government may be sure that this hand will be chopped off." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{mortar and}} {{aggregate}} of Roman concrete was {{built up in}} horizontal layers laid by <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> wooden form-work with {{the thickness of the}} layers determined by the length of the workday, rather than being poured into a mold as concrete is today. Roman concrete domes were thus built similarly to the earlier corbel domes of the Mediterranean region, although they have different structural characteristics. The aggregate used by the Romans was often rubble, but lightweight aggregate in the upper levels served to reduce stresses. Empty [...] "vases and jugs" [...] could be hidden inside to reduce weight. [...] The dry concrete mixtures used by the Romans were compacted with rams to eliminate voids, and added animal blood acted as a water reducer. Because Roman concrete was weak in tension, it did not provide any structural advantage over the use of brick or stone. But, because it could be constructed with unskilled slave labor, it provided a constructional advantage and facilitated the building of large-scale domes.|$|E
500|$|Just before Vladimir died, he {{had sent}} his son Boris on {{campaign}} against the nomads in the south. According to the Primary Chronicle, Sviatopolk seized Kiev while those of Vladimir's retainers who were with Boris on campaign encouraged Boris to take power, an offer Boris refused apparently stating [...] "Be it {{not for me to}} raise my <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> my elder brother". In the confusion resulting from the death of Vladimir Sviatopolk was able to seize power in Kiev, as Yaroslav was in the north, Mstislav in the south, Sviatoslav in the Derevlian land, Gleb in Murom and Boris on the aforementioned expedition against the Pechenegs. As Franklin and Shepard put it, Sviatopolk's [...] "previous arrest turned to his advantage, for it ensured that he was already ... closest to the center of power". According to the Primary Chronicle, Sviatopolk successfully arranged the murder of three of his brothers, Boris of Rostov, Gleb of Murom and Sviatoslav of the Derevlian lands.|$|E
500|$|On May 7, 1972, Kemper {{was driving}} in Berkeley {{when he picked}} up two 18-year-old hitchhiking Fresno State students, Mary Ann Pesce and Anita Mary Luchessa, on the pretext of taking them to Stanford University. After driving for an hour, he managed to reach a secluded wooded area near Alameda, which he was {{familiar}} with from {{his work at the}} Highway Department, without alerting his passengers that he had changed directions from where they wanted to go. Here he intended to rape them, but having learned from serial rapists in Atascadero that you should not leave witnesses, he instead handcuffed Pesce and locked Luchessa in the trunk, before stabbing and strangling Pesce to death and killing Luchessa in a similar manner. Kemper later confessed that while handcuffing Pesce he [...] "brushed the back of [...] <b>hand</b> <b>against</b> one of her breasts and it embarrassed [...] " [...] before adding that [...] " [...] even said 'whoops, I'm sorry' or something like that" [...] after grazing her breast, despite murdering her merely minutes later.|$|E
