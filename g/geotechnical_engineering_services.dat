40|$|On {{the morning}} of March 27 th, 2013, {{a small portion of}} a much larger {{landslide}} complex failed on the western shoreline of central Whidbey Island, Island County, Washington. This landslide, known as the Ledgewood-Bonair Landslide (LB Landslide), mobilized as much as 150, 000 cubic meters of unconsolidated glacial sediment onto the coastline of the Puget Sound (Slaughter et al., 2013, <b>Geotechnical</b> <b>Engineering</b> <b>Services,</b> 2013). This study aims to determine how sediment from the Ledgewood-Bonair Landslide has acted on the adjacent beaches 400 meters to the north and south, and specifically to evaluate the volume of sediment contributed by the slide to adjacent beaches, how persistent bluff-derived accretion has been on adjacent beaches, and how intertidal grain sizes changed {{as a result of the}} bluff-derived sediment, LiDAR imagery from 2013 and 2014 were differenced and compared to beach profile data and grain size photography. Volume change results indicate that of the 41, 850 cubic meters of sediment eroded at the toe of the landslide, 8. 9 percent was redeposited on adjacent beaches within 1 year of the landslide. Of this 8. 9 percent, 6. 3 percent ended up on the north beach and 2. 6 percent ended up on the south beach. Because the landslide deposit was primarily sands, silts, and clays, it is reasonable to assume that the remaining 91. 1 percent of the sediment eroded from the landslide toe was carried out into the waters of the Puget Sound. Over the course of the two-year study, measurable accretion is apparent up to 150 meters north and 100 meters south of the landslide complex. Profile data also suggests that the most significant elevation changes occurred within the first two and half months since the landslides occurrence. The dominant surficial grain size of the beach soon after the landslide was coarse-sand; in the years following the landslide, 150 meters north of the toe the beach sediment became finer while 100 meters south of the toe the beach sediment became coarser. Overall, the LB Landslide has affected beach profile and grain size only locally, within 150 meters of the landslide toe...|$|E
50|$|CoMET {{services}} {{applied to}} evaluate the actual composition of a site’s subsurface {{are part of a}} complete <b>geotechnical</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>service.</b> For purposes of short-term economy, however, some owners select a firm not associated with the geotechnical engineer of record to provide these and all other CoMET services. This approach precludes the geotechnical engineer of record from providing a complete service. It also aggravates risk, because the individuals engaged to evaluate actual subsurface conditions are not “briefed” by the geotechnical engineer of record before they go to the project site and seldom communicate with the geotechnical engineer of record when they discern differences, in large part because the firm associated with the geotechnical engineer of record is regarded as a competitor of the firm employing the field representatives. In some cases, the field representatives in question lack the specific project background information and/or the education and training required to discern those differences.|$|R
50|$|Earthquake {{engineering}} and landslide detection, remediation, and prevention are geoprofessional services associated with specialized types of <b>geotechnical</b> <b>engineering</b> (as well as geophysics; see below), as is forensic <b>geotechnical</b> <b>engineering,</b> a geoprofessional <b>service</b> applied to determine why a certain applicable type of event - usually {{a failure of}} some sort - occurred. (Virtually all geoprofessional services can be performed for forensic purposes, commonly as litigation-support/expert witness <b>services.)</b> Railway-systems <b>engineering</b> is another type of specialized <b>geotechnical</b> <b>engineering,</b> as are the design of piers and bulkheads, drydocks, on-shore and off-shore wind-turbine systems, and systems that stabilize oil platforms and other marine structures to the sea floor.|$|R

50|$|Although <b>geotechnical</b> <b>engineering</b> {{is applied}} {{for a variety of}} purposes, it is {{essential}} to foundation design. As such, <b>geotechnical</b> <b>engineering</b> is applicable to every existing or new structure on the planet; every building and every highway, bridge, tunnel, harbor, airport, water line, reservoir, or other public work. Commonly, the geotechnical-engineering service comprises a study of subsurface conditions using various sampling, in-situ testing, and/or other site-characterization techniques. The instrument of professional service in those cases typically is a report through which geotechnical engineers relate the information they have been retained to provide, typically: their findings; their opinions about subsurface materials and conditions; their judgment about how the subsurface materials and conditions assumed to exist probably will behave when subjected to loads or used as building material; and their preliminary recommendations for materials usage or appropriate foundation systems, the latter based on their knowledge of a structure’s size, shape, weight, etc., and the subsurface/structure interactions likely to occur. Civil engineers, structural engineers, and architects, feasibly among other members of the project team, apply the geotechnical findings and preliminary recommendations to take the structure’s design forward. They realize these preliminary recommendations are subject to change, however, because - as a matter of practical necessity related to the observational method inherent to <b>geotechnical</b> <b>engineering</b> - <b>geotechnical</b> engineers base their recommendations on the composition of samples taken from a tiny portion of a site whose actual subsurface conditions are unknowable before excavation, because they are hidden by earth and/or rock and/or water. For this reason, as a key component of a complete <b>geotechnical</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>service,</b> <b>geotechnical</b> engineers employ construction-materials engineering and testing (CoMET) to observe subsurface materials as they are exposed through excavation. To help achieve economies on their clients’ behalf, geotechnical engineers assign their field representatives - specially educated and trained paraprofessionals - to observe the excavated materials and the excavations themselves in light of conditions the geotechnical engineers opined to exist. When differences are discovered, the geotechnical engineers evaluate the new findings and, when necessary, modify their design and construction recommendations. Because such changes could require other members of the design and construction team to modify their designs, specifications, and proposed methods, many owners have their geotechnical engineers serve as active members of the project team from project inception to conclusion, working with others to help ensure appropriate application of geotechnical information and judgments.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a survey of the current state of practice for teaching <b>geotechnical</b> <b>engineering</b> subjects at Universities in Italy. The survey, which refers to the Academic Year 2012 / 2013, was conducted by means of a purposefully-designed questionnaire filled by one reference person for each Italian University where at least one full-time professor in <b>geotechnical</b> <b>engineering</b> is employed. The questionnaire comprises two sections: 1) brief description of the educational offer in <b>geotechnical</b> <b>engineering</b> within bachelor and master degrees; 2) detailed description of the programme of all the <b>geotechnical</b> <b>engineering</b> courses listed in the previous section. The results of the survey are used to conduct a comparative analysis of the main characteristics of the <b>geotechnical</b> <b>engineering</b> courses currently offered in the different Italian universities.
