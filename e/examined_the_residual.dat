40|$|Backfills of dredged sediments onto {{a former}} {{sand and gravel}} mine site in Charles City County, VA may have the {{potential}} to contaminate local groundwater. To evaluate the mobility of trace elements and to identify the potential contaminants from the dredged sediments, a sequential extraction scheme was used to partition trace elements associated with the sediments from the local aquifer and the dredged sediments into five fractions: exchangeable, acidic, reducible, oxidizable, and residual phases. Sequential extractions indicate that, for most of the trace elements <b>examined,</b> <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> phases account for the largest proportion of the total concentrations, and their total extractable fractions are mainly from reducible and oxidizable phases. Only Cd, Pb, and Zn have an appreciable extractable proportion from the acidic phase in the filled dredged sediments. Our groundwater monitoring data suggest that the dredged sediments are mainly subject to a decrease in p H and a series of oxidation reactions, when exposed to the atmosphere. Because the trace elements released by carbonate dissolution and the oxidation (e. g., organic matter degradation, iron sulfide and, ammonia oxidation) are subsequently immobilized by sorption to iron, manganese, and aluminum oxides, no potential contaminants to local groundwater are expected by addition of the dredged sediments to this site. </p...|$|E

The Sq amplitude was the smallest around the minimum of solar cycle 23 / 24 in 2008 to 2009. The relationship between the solar F 10.7 index and Sq amplitude was approximately linear but about 53 % of geomagnetic stations showed a weak nonlinear relation to the solar F 10.7 index.

The Dutch on-the-road driving test is applied to examine effects of CNS drugs on driving, using the standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP) as primary outcome measure. This paper examines the utility of an alternative outcome measure, lapses, to determine the degree to which CNS drugs impair driving. Methods: Data from two double-blind, placebo-controlled on-the-road driving studies that <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> effects of hypnotic drugs were reanalyzed. The treatments were zaleplon and zolpidem tested 4 h after middle-of-the-night administration, and ramelteon and zopiclone tested 8. 5 h after bedtime administration. In addition to SDLP, outcome measures related to lapses (number, total duration, and maximum deviation) were computed. A lapse was defined as a continuous change in lateral position of greater than 100 cm, lasting for at least 4 s. Results: Both SDLP and lapses were able to detect significant driving impairment after middle-of-the-night administration of zolpidem (10 and 20 mg) and bedtime administration of ramelteon (8 mg) and zopiclone (7. 5 mg) relative to placebo. Both measures found no differences from placebo after middle-of-the-night administration of zaleplon (10 and 20 mg). The number of lapses was more sensitive in differentiating treatment from placebo than the maximum deviation of a lapse or their duration. After considering different lapse duration criteria, a lapse was redefined as a continuous change in lateral position of greater than 100 cm, lasting for at least 8 s. This change in definition did not significantly alter the outcome of the statistical analyses. Conclusions: In addition to SDLP, the number of lapses is a useful outcome measure to identify treatments that impair driving. Future research should determine the unique contributions of SDLP and lapses in defining the potential risk of CNS drugs on driving...|$|E

Lgs. 81 / 08 and D. Lgs. 624 / 96, Italian enforcements of the European Directives. Ventilation system is conceived to face very simplified requirements, whilst critical pollutants or emergency situations are not taken in due considerations. Asides, the ventilation system fault and availability analysis is seldom included in the project. The paper deals with the results of a research work started some years ago at an underground quarry exploited through drift sublevel based on drill and blast technique, to identify criteria suitable to grant effective safety and health -S&H- conditions for the workers operating in the underground in the Prevention through Design approach. Taken into account that the phases for an effective approach to the S&H problems in underground must follow a hierarchic method in which the risk management should be faced from an effective hazard reduction to a minimum at the sources, and the ventilation should be considered only as a 4 th level solution, the possibilities of control at the main pollution sources, i. e. the emission of pollutants due to the rock winning and mucking operations, have been <b>examined.</b> <b>The</b> <b>residual</b> risk was then faced with both the original underground and airways layout definition for a new exploitation development, based on technical and efficiency considerations, and on fire emergency computer simulations.

40|$|Antibodies to {{cytochrome}} P- 450 isozyme 3 a, the ethanol-inducible isozyme in rabbit liver, {{were used}} to determine the role of this enzyme in the microsomal oxidation of alcohols and the p-hydroxylation of aniline. P- 450 isozymes, 2, 3 b, 3 c, 4, and 6 did not crossreact with anti- 3 a IgG as judged by Ouchterlony double diffusion, and radioimmunoassays indicated a crossreactivity of less than 1 %. Greater than 90 % of the activity of purified form 3 a toward aniline, ethanol, n-butanol, and n-pentanol was inhibited by the antibody in the reconstituted system. The catalytic activity of liver microsomes from control or ethanol-treated rabbits was unaffected by the addition of either desferrioxamine (up to 1. 0 m) or EDTA (0. 1 m), suggesting that reactions involving the production of hydroxyl radicals from H 2 O 2 and any contaminating iron in the system did not make a significant contribution to the microsomal activity. The addition of anti- 3 a IgG to hepatic microsomes from ethanol-treated rabbits inhibited the metabolism of ethanol, n-butanol, n-pentanol, and aniline by about 75, 70, 80, and 60 %, respectively, while the inhibition of the activity of microsomes from control animals was only about one-half as great. The rate of microsomal H 2 O 2 formation was inhibited to a lesser extent than the formation of acetaldehyde, thus suggesting that the antibody was acting to prevent the direct oxidation of ethanol by form 3 a.

The Sq amplitude observed at these geomagnetic stations showed a clear dependence on the 10 - to 12 -year solar activity, and it tended to increase during each solar maximum phase. Especially, a significant depression in the Sq amplitude occurred around the minimum of solar cycle 23 / 24 in 2008 to 2009, and the amplitude was the smallest in the data analysis period (1947 to 2013). However, this depression cannot {{be seen in the}} solar F 10.7 index compared with that during the minimum of solar cycle 22 / 23 in 1995 to 1996. The correlation analysis between the Sq amplitude and solar F 10.7 index showed that the Sq amplitude tends to increase with an increase in the solar F 10.7 index but saturates for a high F 10.7 value of 150 or more. On the basis of this correlation analysis result, {{it can be said that}} the relationship between the solar F 10.7 index and Sq amplitude is approximately linear but includes a weak nonlinearity for about 53 % of the investigated stations. Because the production rate of electrons and ions should be proportional to the solar EUV flux, this nonlinear effect could be linked to the nonlinear relationship between the solar F 10.7 and EUV flux, or the chemical loss processes of ionospheric ions, or the dynamical effects of ionospheric plasma, or a combination of these factors. In order to remove the effect of solar activity seen in the long-term variation in the Sq amplitude, we calculated a linear or second-order fitting curve between the solar F 10.7 index and Sq amplitude during 1947 to 2013 and <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> Sq amplitude, which was defined as the deviation from the fitted curve.

40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{study of a}} set of well-isolated pulses in GRB light curves indicates that simple pulse models, with smooth and monotonic pulse rise and decay regions, are inadequate. <b>Examining</b> <b>the</b> <b>residuals</b> of fits of pulses to such models suggests the following patterns of departure from the smooth pulse model of Norris et al. (2005) : A Precursor Shelf occurs prior to or concurrent with the exponential Rapid Rise. The pulse reaches maximum intensity at the Peak Plateau, then undergoes a Rapid Decay. The decay changes into an Extended Tail. Pulses are almost universally characterized by hard-to-soft evolution, arguing that the new pulse features reflect a single physical phenomenon, rather than artifacts of pulse overlap.
