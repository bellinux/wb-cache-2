This rate is similar to that found by the Confederation of European Forest Owners (CEPF 2012) who reported that insurance costs lower than the quotation rate of 0.3 % would be more acceptable to forest owners. However, this rate is well below premium rates currently offered by insurance companies in the U.S. and other countries. It is also lower than the 2006 mortality rate (0.8 %) for all forests in the U.S. (Smith et al. 2009).|$|R

40|$|The {{notion that}} {{individuals}} face idiosyncratic labor-market uncertainty {{is a common}} one. Government programs such as unemployment insurance and social security are motivated by such an idea. Economic theory, ranging from labor supply to savings behavior to asset pric-ing, often presupposes that such risks are im-portant. A number of papers, however, have questioned this orthodoxy. Sumru Altug and Robert A. Miller (1990), for instance, are un-able to reject a set of factor-structure restrictions implied by complete markets. John H. Cochrane (1991) and Barbara J.

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} for Airbus preparing a new freighter development process was {{the design of a}} solid freighter barrier, which separates the courier area from the cargo compartment. The major task of such a barrier is to protect the passengers <b>against</b> <b>all</b> <b>risks</b> caused due to cargo impact by a justifiable design. These risks may result from all kind of survivable incident and accident scenarios. Real aircraft crashes were analyzed to get away from a static book-case and come to a more realistic dynamic crash scenario. A reduced-order simulation model was built up to investigate and simulate the dynamic effects during crash. The simulation model considers the highly nonlinear stiffness and damping characteristics of all critical cargo types and also includes their energy absorption potentials. A series of full scale container crash tests have been performed at accredited car crash facilities. The test campaigns were complemented by numerous component tests to study also general crash principles. The critical simulation parameters were identified and implemented into the simulation model. The subsequent validation process showed a close agreement between simulation and test. The simulation environment {{has turned out to be}} a reliable basis to simulate all critical barrier loads with respect to the specific aircraft loading distributions. The essence of this investigation is an adequate understanding of the real crash effects. The proposed dynamic crash approach is more realistic than the static condition and results in an optimized safety barrier wall concept. This dynamic approach provides equivalent safety compared to the existing devices and is accepted by FAA and EASA...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} is to clarify benefits and risks in regards with data protection, cost; business can have {{by the use of}} this new technologies for the implementation and management of organization’s information systems. Design/methodology/approach – Qualitative case study of the results obtained via interviews. Three research questions were raised: Q 1 : How can company benefit from using Cloud Computing compared to other solutions?; Q 2 : What are possible issues that occur with Cloud Computing?; Q 3 : How would Cloud Computing change an organizations’ IT infrastructure? Findings – The calculations provided in the interview section prove the financial advantages, even though the precise degree of flexibility and performance has not been assessed. Cloud Computing offers great scalability. Another benefit that Cloud Computing offers, in addition to better performance and flexibility, is reliable and simple backup data storage, physically distributed and so almost invulnerable to damage. Although the advantages of Cloud Computing more than compensate for the difficulties associated with it, the latter must be carefully considered. Since the cloud architecture is relatively new, so far the best guarantee <b>against</b> <b>all</b> <b>risks</b> it entails, from a single company's perspective, is a well-formulated service-level agreement, where the terms of service and the shared responsibility and security roles between the client and the provider are defined. Research limitations/implications – study was carried out on the bases of two companies, which gives deeper view, but for more widely applicable results, a wider analysis is necessary. Practical implications : Originality/Value – novelty of the research depends on the fact that existing approaches on this problem mainly focus on technical side of computing.

50|$|Global risk {{potentials}} {{and their}} interplay with economic, social and ecological processes of change {{have emerged as}} a challenge to the international community. Never before has human intervention in nature assumed global dimensions. This has been driven on the one hand by a growing global population, particularly in developing countries, {{and on the other hand}} by rising human demands in conjunction with specific patterns of production and consumption, above all in industrialised countries. By presenting this report, the WBGU hopes to contribute constructively to an effective, efficient and objective management of the risks of global change. The approach taken by the WBGU is first to classify globally relevant risks and then to assign to these classes of risk both established and innovative risk assessment strategies and risk management tools. On this basis, management priorities can be set. However, the WBGU notes that it is impossible to safeguard <b>against</b> <b>all</b> global <b>risks,</b> particularly as exploiting opportunities will always entail taking risks.|$|R

We investigate whether, as some suggest, progressive taxes provide additional insurance.

Using repeated cross-sections from the US consumer expenditure survey (CEX), we relate changes in consumption inequality to several measures of tax progressivity. Identification exploits the variation in taxes both across states and over time. Our results suggest, under weak assumptions, that progressive taxes do not induce insurance, while stronger assumptions quantify this effect. ...|$|R
