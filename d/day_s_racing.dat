40|$|Vocational {{rehabilitation}} (VR) is {{a program}} that provides individualized and supportive services to assist individuals with disabilities in obtaining and maintaining employment compatible with their skills, abilities, and interests. Previous {{research has shown that}} people with disabilities are at risk for experiencing discrimination in multiple stages of the rehabilitation process. The primary {{purpose of this study was}} to explore if recommendations for hypothetical rehabilitation services by rehabilitation counseling students were influenced by (a) the consumer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>race,</b> (b) causal attribution of disability, (c) participant 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>race,</b> and (d) the interaction of the counselor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>race</b> and consumer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>race.</b> A 2 x 2 x 3 Factorial design was utilized and results from this study revealed that recommendations for rehabilitation services were not influenced by the consumer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>race,</b> participant 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>race,</b> or the interaction of the counselor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>race</b> and consumer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>race.</b> The findings did reveal that a hypothetical consumer who had an internal cause of disability was more likely to receive fewer recommendations for rehabilitation services then a consumer with an external cause.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to investigate: (1) whether mock jurors would discriminate against an Aboriginal defendant in a criminal murder trial, and (22 ̆ 7) whether, if such discrimination was evident, it could be moderated by symbolic racism or jury instructions. A community sample from the British Columbia lower mainland read a trial vignette in which the defendant 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>race</b> (Aboriginal or Non-Aboriginal) and jury instructions (given or not given) were systematically varied, and rated how guilty they believed the defendant was. No effects on guilt ratings were observed for the defendant 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>race</b> or jury instructions, but a significant. interaction was observed between the defendant 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>race</b> and scores on 1 of the 2 fxtors comprising the symbolic racism scale. This finding suggests that future research on juror prejudice against Canadian Aboriginals using more ecologically valid methods is merited, and that symbolic racism theory provides a useful theoretical foundation for such inquiries...|$|R

40|$|Both Black and White jurors {{exhibit a}} racial bias by being {{more likely to}} find {{defendants}} of a different race guilty than defendants who are of the same race. Sommers 2 ̆ 6 Ellsworth (2000, 2001) found that salient racial issues in a trial reduced White juror racial bias toward a Black defendant. We examined if race salience could reduce White juror racial bias, even for individuals who reported high levels of racism. Making race salient reduced White juror racial bias toward a Black defendant. Jurors 2 ̆ 7 racist beliefs were only associated with the verdict when the defendant 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>race</b> was not made salient. This finding suggests that the effects of individual prejudice toward a Black defendant can be reduced by making the defendant 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>race</b> salient...|$|R

40|$|Racial {{inequality}} in educational and occupational attainment has 				been {{shown to be}} related to racial {{inequality in}} test scores and 				cognitive skills. Most research and policy attention has been 				given to the ability of schools to equalize test scores. I argue 				that a major reason why researchers have been unable to explain 				why schools have not closed the gap is because by the time 				children begin school it may be too late. Cognitive skills 				develop from infancy and as such, it should be unsurprising that 				by the time children are five years old the differences across 				groups are firmly established. Thus, this research attempts to 				uncover where the racial test-score gap begins by examining 				infants. I perform a series of analyses using ordinary least squares 				regression (OLS) and structural equation modeling (SEM) using 				the first wave of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey [...] Birth 				cohort (ECLS-B). I utilize the mother 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>race,</b> rather than the 				child 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>race,</b> in the analyses because looking at the mother 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> 				<b>race</b> makes the most logical sense since the mother 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>race</b> is 				more likely than the child 2 ̆ 7 s to determine household income, 				marital status, mother 2 ̆ 7 s education, parenting styles, and so on. I demonstrate that there is little to no raw gap in cognitive 				skills between the infants of White and Black mothers in the 				United States. However, through SEM I find that when one 				controls for social, human, and financial capital, and for 				differences in health and type of childcare, the infants of 				African American mothers would actually do better than the 				infants of White mothers because of their precocious motor 				development. I find no support for genetics and childcare and 				only limited support for financial and human capital as 				mediators of the gap. However, there is support for family 				social capital and low birth weight as key mediators of the 				small Black-White test score gap in infancy...|$|R
