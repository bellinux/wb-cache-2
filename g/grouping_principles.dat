50|$|The {{principle}} of proximity states that, all else being equal, perception tends to group stimuli that are close together {{as part of the}} same object, and stimuli that are far apart as two separate objects. The {{principle of}} similarity states that, all else being equal, perception lends itself to seeing stimuli that physically resemble each other as part of the same object, and stimuli that are different as part of a different object. This allows for people to distinguish between adjacent and overlapping objects based on their visual texture and resemblance. The principle of closure refers to the mind's tendency to see complete figures or forms even if a picture is incomplete, partially hidden by other objects, or if part of the information needed to make a complete picture in our minds is missing. For example, if part of a shape's border is missing people still tend to see the shape as completely enclosed by the border and ignore the gaps. The principle of good continuation makes sense of stimuli that overlap: when there is an intersection between two or more objects, people tend to perceive each as a single uninterrupted object. The principle of common fate groups stimuli together {{on the basis of their}} movement. When visual elements are seen moving in the same direction at the same rate, perception associates the movement as part of the same stimulus. This allows people to make out moving objects even when other details, such as color or outline, are obscured. The principle of good form refers to the tendency to group together forms of similar shape, pattern, color, etc. Later research has identified additional <b>grouping</b> <b>principles.</b>|$|E

40|$|Perceptual {{grouping}} {{refers to}} the process of determining which regions and parts of the visual scene belong together as parts of higher order perceptual units such as objects or patterns. In the early 20 th century, Gestalt psychologists identified a set of classic <b>grouping</b> <b>principles</b> which specified how some image features lead to grouping between elements given that all other factors were held constant. Modern vision scientists have expanded this list to cover a wide range of image features but have also expanded the importance of learning and other non-image factors. Unlike early Gestalt accounts which were based largely on visual demonstrations, modern theories are often explicitly quantitative and involve detailed models of how various image features modulate grouping. Work has also been done to understand the rules by which different <b>grouping</b> <b>principles</b> integrate to form a final percept. This chapter gives an overview of the classic principles, modern developments in understanding them, and new principles and the evidence for them. There is also discussion of some of the larger theoretical issues about grouping such as at what stage of visual processing it occurs and what types of neural mechanisms may implement <b>grouping</b> <b>principles...</b>|$|E

There is a similar connection of low-level retinal/cortical processing to high-level Gestalt <b>grouping</b> <b>principles</b> stated by other researchers in the field. For instance, Craft et al. [90] propose a neural mechanism of ‘figure–ground organization’ based on border ownership to model complex cells in the primary visual cortex (V 1). In their investigation of grouping cell connections, they linked their findings to Gestalt <b>grouping</b> <b>principles</b> such as ‘connectivity’, and ‘convexity’ by applying connection weights based on different sizes of receptive fields in the cortex which was modelled based on multiscale and orientated DoG filters.

40|$|Background: Deficits in autism {{have been}} characterised as a bias towards local over global processing. This paper {{examines}} {{whether there is}} a deficit in gestalt grouping in autism. Method: Twenty-five low-functioning children with autism and 25 controls who were matched for chronological age and verbal mental age took part in the study. Results: The autism group utilised gestalt <b>grouping</b> <b>principles</b> (proximity, similarity, closure) significantly less than the controls. Calculating an overall index of gestalt grouping, the autism group performed at chance level. There was also a deficit in identifying certain impossible figures. This pattern was not reflected in a drawing task, in which the autism sample conformed more to gestalt <b>grouping</b> <b>principles</b> than controls (non-significantly). Conclusions: The results are discussed in terms of a failure in autism to process inter-element relationships that would allow for the appreciation of larger perceptually coherent units that comprise of multiple elements and, consequently, context.

40|$|Object-based {{models of}} visual {{attention}} purport {{to explain why}} {{it is easier to}} process information within one object or perceptual group than across two or more groups. Perceptual groups are generally defined in terms of Gestalt <b>grouping</b> <b>principles.</b> These models of attention have been used to explain the phenomenon of cognitive tunneling within Heads-Up Displays (HUDs), {{on the assumption that the}} symbology of a Heads-Up Display (HUD) in a cockpit forms a single perceptual group and the outside scene forms another. Despite extensive empirical support, object-based models have various shortcomings. In particular, the use of Gestalt <b>grouping</b> <b>principles</b> to define the notion of objects does not allow for an operational measure of what an object is to the visual system. Also, the Gestalt principles do not allow for a systematic distinction between spatial and object-based mechanisms of attention. Finally, it is generally assumed that Gestalt grouping occurs preattentively, whereas there is evidence that perceptual grouping requires attentional resources. The proposed line of research aims to develop an account of object-based attention that does not rely on these premises. Rather, it is assumed that the cost of dividing attention betwee...|$|E

40|$|A {{principle}} of perceptual organization, called uniform connectedness (13 C), is described, and a theoretical approach to perceptual organization is proposed inwhich this principle playsafundamental role. The {{principle of}}UC states that closed regions ofhomogeneous properties-such as lightness,chromatic color, texture,and so forth [...] {{tend to be}} perceived initially as single units. We demonstrate its effects and show that they occur even when opposed bypowerful <b>grouping</b> <b>principles</b> such as proximityand similarity.

40|$|Since their {{formulation}} by the Gestalt movement {{more than}} a century ago, the principles of perceptual grouping have primarily been investigated in the visual modality and, to a lesser extent, in the auditory modality. The present review addresses {{the question of whether the}} same <b>grouping</b> <b>principles</b> also affect the perception of tactile stimuli. Although, to date, only a few studies have explicitly investigated the existence of Gestalt <b>grouping</b> <b>principles</b> in the tactile modality, we argue that many more studies have indirectly provided evidence relevant to this topic. Reviewing this body of research, we argue that similar principles to those reported previously in visual and auditory studies also govern the perceptual grouping of tactile stimuli. In particular, we highlight evidence showing that the principles of proximity, similarity, common fate, good continuation, and closure affect tactile perception in both unimodal and crossmodal settings. We also highlight that the grouping of tactile stimuli is often affected by visual and auditory information that happen to be presented simultaneously. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and applied benefits that might pertain to the further study of Gestalt principles operating in both unisensory and multisensory tactile perception...|$|E

40|$|Several recent {{theories}} of visual information processing have postulated that errors in recognition may result {{not only from}} a failure in feature extraction, but also from a failure to correctly join features {{after they have been}} correctly extracted. Errors that result from incorrectly integrating features are called conjunction errors. The present study uses conjunction errors to investigate the principles used by the visual system to integrate features. The research tests whether the visual system is more likely to integrate features located close together in visual space (the location principle} or whether the visual system is more likely to integrate feature,s from stimulus items that come from the same perceptual group or object {the perceptual group principle}. In four target-detection experiments, stimuli were created so that feature integration by the location principle and feature integration by the perceptual <b>group</b> <b>principle</b> made diffe:cent predictions for performance.

40|$|Gestalt <b>grouping</b> <b>principles</b> provide {{important}} cues for organizing visual inputs into coherent percepts. While {{a number of}} models for each grouping principle have been proposed, a unifying architecture that would flexibly incorporate all of them is still lacking. Moreover, many of these models operate in mathematical terms, rendering them unsuitable for a wider testing on real input images. Here we present a generic biologically plausible unsupervised architecture, which we term gmin ([URL] geared towards a unified implementation of the <b>grouping</b> <b>principles.</b> The model operates by extracting a certain feature of interest from an input image (e. g., edges) and selecting maximally informative units to decrease computational load; then it proceeds to iteratively compute grouping strength between all pairs of units and update informative unit selection using a particular grouping principle (e. g., good continuation). This process is repeated for all features of interest. Finally, a segmentation of an image into (provisional) objects is provided by an unsupervised learning procedure on the computed grouping strengths, such as clustering or belief propagation. We illustrate the validity and the general usefulness of our approach by testing it on a few very different grouping displays. Using the cues of proximity, good continuation, or orientation similarity, {{we were able to}} obtain a satisfying model performance on the classic Gestalt displays of dot lattices, contour integration, and texture segregation...|$|E
