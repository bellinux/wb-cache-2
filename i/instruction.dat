5|$|In 1989, HP {{determined}} that Reduced <b>Instruction</b> Set Computing (RISC) architectures were approaching a processing limit at one <b>instruction</b> per cycle. HP researchers investigated a new architecture, later named Explicitly Parallel <b>Instruction</b> Computing (EPIC), {{that allows the}} processor to execute multiple instructions in each clock cycle. EPIC implements a form of very long <b>instruction</b> word (VLIW) architecture, in which a single <b>instruction</b> word contains multiple instructions. With EPIC, the compiler determines in advance which instructions can be executed at the same time, so the microprocessor simply executes the instructions and does not need elaborate mechanisms to determine which instructions to execute in parallel.|$|E
5|$|In Malaysia, Malay is the {{language}} of <b>instruction</b> for most subjects while English is a compulsory subject, but , English is still {{the language}} of <b>instruction</b> for mathematics and the natural sciences for certain schools. Some schools provide Mandarin and Tamil as languages of <b>instruction</b> for certain subjects. Each level of education demands different skills of teaching and learning ability.|$|E
5|$|In this example, <b>instruction</b> 3 {{cannot be}} {{executed}} before (or even in parallel with) <b>instruction</b> 2, because <b>instruction</b> 3 uses a result from <b>instruction</b> 2. It violates condition 1, and thus introduces a flow dependency.|$|E

5|$|The machine's <b>instruction</b> set was {{increased}} from the 7 of the SSEM to 26 initially, including multiplication done in hardware. This increased to 30instructions in the Final Specification version. Ten bits of each word were allocated {{to hold the}} <b>instruction</b> code. The standard <b>instruction</b> time was 1.8 milliseconds, but multiplication was much slower, {{depending on the size}} of the operand.|$|E
5|$|A {{word in the}} computer's memory {{could be}} read, written, or refreshed, in 360microseconds. An <b>instruction</b> took four times as long to execute as {{accessing}} a word from memory, giving an <b>instruction</b> execution rate of about 700 per second. The main store was refreshed continuously, a process which took 20milliseconds to complete, as each of the SSEM's 32words had to be read and then refreshed in sequence.|$|E

30|$|Programming of the {{proposed}} embedded ASIP includes three types of <b>instructions.</b> The first type is the ordinary classes like program flow <b>instructions</b> (conditional and unconditional jumps), move <b>instructions,</b> real, and complex ADD/SUB <b>instructions,</b> interfacing control <b>instructions</b> (external reads, output set). The second type is optimized <b>instructions</b> to facilitate the implementation of synchronization subsystem tasks {{as well as other}} algorithms {{in different parts of the}} engine. The third type is vector <b>instructions.</b>|$|R
5|$|Each 32-bit word of RAM could contain {{either a}} program <b>instruction</b> or data. In a program <b>instruction,</b> bits 0–12 {{represented}} the memory {{address of the}} operand to be used, and bits 13–15 specified the operation to be executed, such as storing a number in memory; the remaining 16bits were unused. The SSEM's single operand architecture meant that the second operand of any operation was implicit: the accumulator or the program counter (<b>instruction</b> address); program instructions specified only {{the address of the}} data in memory.|$|E

5|$|Frequency scaling was the {{dominant}} reason for improvements in computer performance from the mid-1980s until 2004.

5|$|Smith's {{teaching}} style differed from conventional music <b>instruction</b> {{at the time}} in that she required instrumental students to study voice. Piano, organ and violin <b>instruction</b> was offered by 1907. Organ was under the <b>instruction</b> of Gertrude Madeira Smith, Eleanor's sister, and violin was taught by Charles Moerenhout of the Chicago Orchestra. Five assistants also helped the teachers. Smith felt that adding vocal training gave a level of experience that was neglected by singular focus on memorization of scales and structural drills usually prevalent for those learning instruments. She also incorporated songs from the students' homelands as a way to intermingle their old cultures with their new lives and made effort to involve the parents {{in the development of the}} curricula. As a progressive reformer, Smith advocated that inclusive diversity was a means of building a cosmopolitan citizenry united by pursuit of music excellence. She also encouraged students to compose music from their earliest <b>instruction</b> and to recover songs from their cultural backgrounds.|$|E
