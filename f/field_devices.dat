40|$|This thesis {{documents}} the successful development {{and testing of}} a more secure industrial control system <b>field</b> <b>device</b> architecture and software. The implementation of a secure <b>field</b> <b>device</b> has had limitations in the past {{due to a lack}} of secure operating system and guidelines. With the recent verification of OK Labs SEL 4 microkernel, a verified operating system for such devices is possible, creating a possibility for a secure <b>field</b> <b>device</b> following open standards using known security protocols and low level memory and functionary isolation. The virtualized prototype makes use of common hardware and an existing secure <b>field</b> <b>device</b> architecture to implement a new level of security where the device is verified to function as expected. The experimental evaluation provides performance data which indicates the usefulness of the architecture in the field and security function integration testing to guarantee secure programs can be implemented on the device. Results of the devices functionality are hopeful, showing useful performance for many applications and further development as a fully functional secure <b>field</b> <b>device...</b>|$|R

5000|$|A major {{application}} of current loops is {{the industry standard}} 4-20 mA current loop for process control applications, where they are extensively used to carry signals from process instrumentation to PID controllers, SCADA systems, and Programmable logic controllers.

These loops have the advantages of simplicity and noise immunity, and have a large international user and equipment supplier base. Some 4-20 mA <b>field</b> <b>devices</b> can be powered by the current loop itself, removing the need for separate power supplies, and the [...] "smart" [...] HART Protocol uses the loop for communications between <b>field</b> <b>devices</b> and controllers.
