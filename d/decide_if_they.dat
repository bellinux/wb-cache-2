5|$|Before the 1984 Winter Olympics, {{a dispute}} formed over what made a player a professional. The IOC had adopted {{a rule that}} made any player who had signed an NHL {{contract}} but played less than ten games in the league eligible. However, the United States Olympic Committee maintained that any player contracted with an NHL team was a professional and therefore not eligible to play. The IOC held an emergency meeting that ruled NHL-contracted players were eligible, {{as long as they}} had not played in any NHL games. This made five players on Olympic rosters—one Austrian, two Italians and two Canadians—ineligible. Players who had played in other professional leagues—such as the World Hockey Association—were allowed to play. Canadian hockey official Alan Eagleson stated that the rule was only applied to the NHL and that professionally contracted players in European leagues were still considered amateurs. Murray Costello of the CAHA suggested that a Canadian withdrawal was possible. In 1986, the IOC voted to allow all athletes to compete in Olympic Games starting in 1988, but let the individual sport federations <b>decide</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> wanted to allow professionals.|$|E

25|$|User {{privacy in}} China {{is not as}} cut-and-dry {{as it is in}} other parts of the world. China, reportedly, has a much more {{invasive}} policy when Internet activity involves the Chinese government. For this reason, search engines are under constant pressure to conform to Chinese rules and regulations on censorship while still attempting to keep their integrity. Therefore, most search engines operate differently in China than in the other countries, such as the US or Britain, if they operate in China at all. There are two types of intrusions that occur in China regarding the internet: the alleged intrusion of the company providing users with Internet service, and the alleged intrusion of the Chinese government. The intrusion allegations made against companies providing users with Internet service are based upon reports that companies, such as Yahoo! in the previous example, are using their access to the internet users' private information to track and monitor users' Internet activity. The claims made against the Chinese government lies in the fact that the government is forcing Internet-based companies to track users private online data without the user knowing that they are being monitored. Both alleged intrusions are relatively harsh and possibly force foreign Internet service providers to <b>decide</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> value the Chinese market over internet privacy. Also, many websites are blocked in China such as Facebook and Twitter. However many Chinese internet users use special methods like a VPN to unblock websites that are blocked.|$|E
500|$|The {{first stage}} is the Blind Auditions, where artists sing {{in front of}} the judges/coaches. In this round, each coach selects 14 singers for their team. Four coaches, all {{noteworthy}} recording artists, choose teams of contestants through a blind audition process. Each coach has the length of the auditioner's performance (about 90 seconds) to <b>decide</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> want the singer on their team. If one of the coaches is satisfied with the voice of an artist, and wants to mentor them for the next stage, they press the [...] "I WANT YOU" [...] button by their chair. This turns the chair around to face the stage, and allows the coach to see the artist for the first time after they have sung. This avoids any bias {{on the part of the}} judge/coach because of an artist's characteristics or personality. If two or more coaches want the same singer, the singer chooses their coach. The artist's journey on the show comes to an end if no coach selects them.|$|E

500|$|At an IIHF {{congress}} in 1969, officials voted to allow body-checking {{in all three}} zones in a rink similar to the NHL. Prior to that, body-checking was only allowed in the defending zone in international hockey. The IIHF later described the rule change as [...] "arguably the most substantial and dramatic rule changes {{in the history of}} international hockey" [...] because it allowed for a more aggressive game. The rule, which was first applied at the 1970 World Championships, was controversial: IIHF president Bunny Ahearne feared it would make ice hockey [...] "a sport for goons." [...] Several other rule changes were implemented in the early 1970s: players were required to wear helmets starting in 1970 and goaltender masks became mandatory in 1972. In 1992, the IIHF switched to using a playoff system to determine medalists and decided that tie games in the medal round would be decided in a shootout. The IIHF decided to test a new rule in 1997 that would allow two-line passes. Prior to that, the neutral zone trap had slowed the game down and reduced scoring. At the 1997 World Championships, teams were allowed to <b>decide</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> wanted to test the rule. Although no team accepted the offer, the rule was adopted. The IIHF described it as [...] "the most revolutionary rule change since allowing body-checking in all three zones in 1969. [...] The new rule almost immediately changed the game for the better. The 1999 IIHF World Championship in Norway was a stark contrast to the finals the year before with many more goals scored and with end-to-end action– not defence– dominating play." ...|$|E
500|$|It is {{not just}} the women in his life that Lex has a {{difficult}} time maintaining a healthy relationship with, but his father as well. Rosenbaum characterizes the relationship between Lex and Lionel as a form of tug-of-war, and disagrees with John Glover's assessment that Lionel is merely testing Lex for the life he is going to take over. For Rosenbaum, Lex is being pushed and pushed, and Lex is afraid that he will reach the point that he knows he will {{no longer be able to}} come back from. In [...] "Vortex", Lex realizes that he forgot who he was in that moment that his father was trapped under the column, and he felt guilty over the situation. According to Rosenbaum, Lex realized that by letting his father die he would have been traveling down a dark path, and would have become all that his father was—evil. As Lex continues to live in his father's shadow, and as time progresses, he learns more about the [...] "monster" [...] that Lionel truly is. The breaking point comes when Lex learns that his father killed Lex's grandparents in a tenement fire. Rosenbaum sees this as the ultimate ethical dilemma—he likens it to parents learning that their child has murdered someone, and then having to <b>decide</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> should go to the authorities or not—and Lex, who can no longer take his father's abuse, decides to turn Lionel over to the FBI. According to Rosenbaum, the decision is justified to Lex, who sees that monster that Lionel really is from his actions—using electroshock therapy to erase Lex's memories, drugging Lex, killing his own parents, and the way he treated Lex's mother.|$|E
500|$|The Moon Shaped Pool tour drew {{criticism}} for its {{inclusion of a}} date in Tel Aviv on 19 July, disregarding the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign for an international cultural boycott of Israel. Radiohead were subject to protests at some concerts, where sections of the audience unfurled Palestinian flags. On 23 April, more than 50 prominent figures, including musician Roger Waters, whose 2017 album Is This the Life We Really Want? was produced by Godrich, signed a petition urging Radiohead to cancel the show. Yorke told Rolling Stone he found the criticism [...] "extremely upsetting ... choose to, rather than engage with us personally, throw shit at us in public. It's deeply disrespectful to assume that we're either being misinformed or that we're so retarded we can't make these decisions ourselves. I thought it was patronising in the extreme." [...] He felt the criticisms created [...] "divisive energy" [...] rather than [...] "bring people together". Godrich added {{that he did not}} [...] "believe in cultural boycotts ... I don't think they're positive, ever ... The people you'd be denying [...] are the people who would agree with you and don't necessarily agree with their government." [...] Waters responded in a public statement saying he had written to Yorke months earlier, but that Yorke had replied angrily and not replied to further correspondence. On 11 July, filmmaker Ken Loach wrote in the Independent that [...] " [...] stubborn refusal to engage with the many critics of their ill-advised concert in Tel Aviv suggests to me that they only want to hear one side – the one that supports apartheid... Radiohead need to <b>decide</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> stand with the oppressed or with the oppressor." [...] Yorke responded in a statement: [...] "Playing in a country isn't the same as endorsing the government. Music, art and academia is about crossing borders not building them, about open minds not closed ones, about shared humanity, dialogue and freedom of expression." [...] The show went ahead as planned, with Yorke telling the audience: [...] "A lot was said about this, but in the end we played some music." ...|$|E
