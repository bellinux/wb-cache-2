500|$|Slayer has {{toyed with}} the idea of {{creating}} a live set mixed with selections from the album and 1990's Seasons in the Abyss, though Hanneman said it's something which hasn't been [...] "seriously considered". Metal Maniacs asked Slayer in a 2006 interview whether they would consider playing South of Heaven in the footsteps of the Still Reigning tour, to which Araya replied, [...] "It's becoming a trendy thing now. I don't <b>know.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> some really cool albums, but I don't think we'll ever do that again." [...] King was equally unsure, commenting, [...] "Probably not. And I just don't like enough songs off South of Heaven." ...|$|E
500|$|Since 1996, when MLS {{teams were}} first {{included}} in the tournament, the home team had won nine times and lost only twice in the final match. Commenting on what his team brings to the game, Sounders FC coach Sigi Schmid stated, [...] "We bring a clean slate. We haven't had any negative experiences in championship games, {{so we want to}} just build up a positive legacy for our team and we <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a chance to make some history for our team. Every player knows that and that's something we want to try and do." [...] D.C. United had previously won the U.S. Open Cup twice in 1996 and 2008 and this was their fourth appearance ever in the tournament final. D.C. United president Kevin Payne simply stated, [...] "We want to win anything we enter." ...|$|E
500|$|Byrne {{has written}} for Wired, {{outlining}} {{the relative merits of}} different distribution models with this one reflecting his [...] "self-distributionmodel" [...] in which [...] "the artist stands to receive the largest percentage of income from sales per unit—sales of anything. A larger percentage of fewer sales, most likely, but not always. Artists doing it for themselves can actually make more money than the massive popstar, even though the sales numbers may seem minuscule by comparison." [...] The motivation for creating and marketing this album directly came in part from the very article Byrne wrote as well as Eno's belief that music fans want more than just the music on an album and prefer collectible deluxe editions as well as the live performances that promote them. A month after releasing the album, Byrne was skeptical of market saturation claiming [...] "I sense {{that a lot of people}} don't <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a record out" [...] and hoped to counterbalance that ignorance with his tour. He also described the digital music market as [...] "so infinite [...] it's easy for music to get lost out there" [...] and has noted that this business model would not work for performers who are not already established.|$|E

500|$|With its [...] "furious, anarchist edge", [...] "Gandhi Mate, Gandhi" [...] {{focuses on}} the {{distinction}} between social and economic stability, summarising capitalism as [...] "a long outdated system... that does nothing but divide and segregate us". The song {{has been seen as}} supporting the Occupy London movement; Reynolds called it a [...] "very frustrated and confused song" [...] reflecting the current Zeitgeist: [...] "People <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the resources, the creativity, and the ingenuity to do better than what we have at the moment and are struggling {{to come to terms with}} the short term love of money over the long-term stability and progression of our species." [...] The song focuses on two characters; Reynolds' vocals supply a revolutionary perspective, and Rory Clewlow's are those of a person in power. [...] "Gandhi mate, Gandhi" [...] has unconventional lyrics for its characters; [...] "Yabba Dabba do one, son" [...] was described by Reynolds as the product of a drunken MC battle, and during the song the other band members pause and urge Reynolds to calm down. Reynolds described [...] "Gandhi mate, Gandhi" [...] as a [...] "lively electro influenced dubstep" [...] and a [...] "rap rock pileup" [...] textured over [...] "wobbly dubstep bass".|$|E
500|$|Feige {{stated that}} Steve Rogers would be paired with other {{characters}} from The Avengers like Black Widow and Nick Fury, because unlike Tony Stark and Thor, who {{could return to}} their own supporting casts, Rogers had nowhere else to go, [...] "and it just made sense {{that he was the}} one that stayed with what remains of the Avengers at the end of the film." [...] The writers considered including Hawkeye, but [...] "he didn't have enough to do and suddenly it seemed like we were giving him short shrift", leading all of his parts to be fulfilled by Black Widow, and Joe Russo added that Jeremy Renner's schedule could not be worked out for him to appear. As to why the Red Skull from The First Avenger did not appear in The Winter Soldier, Joe Russo explained, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a guy in a computer, but the tone we were chasing was sort of that conspiracy thriller. And we wanted to try and ground the movie as much as we could. And Red Skull, he's a fantastical character and didn't necessarily fit for Cap 2 and especially because it was about the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D. Certainly Hydra exists and that's his legacy, but there's something interesting about the fact that his legacy outlived the skull. And they're still dealing with the demons of it, but not necessarily him." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the time}} periods the series could {{potentially}} explore following {{the first season}} given Carter's role in , Atwell said, [...] "I think {{the great thing about}} the fact that I've already played her {{at the end of her}} life means that we <b>know</b> ... <b>we</b> <b>have</b> an opportunity, if the show does go into second and third and fourth and fifth , we know that we can explore all of these aspects of her character because we know she lives such a long life and she's had a fulfilled life. I think what's going to start happening in Season 1 is seeds are going to be planted as to what happens in her personal life—and yet it's still open to the possibility of new men coming into her life, deepening relationships with the men that we discover in Season 1. Obviously, the era is 1946 but in the second, third, fourth, fifth season—if it goes onto that—we can explore different time periods. We can explore the late forties, the early fifties, the sixties, the seventies, the eighties, up until present day, so it's very exciting because of that." [...] However, Butters clarified that future seasons would likely stay in the same time period, possibly changing location to a place like Hollywood or Europe, to remain in a pre-S.H.I.E.L.D. setting and avoid competing with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. This was the case with the second season, which moved the series to 1947 Los Angeles.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a further}} letter of September 1975, Wallace writes that MI5 was backing {{a group of}} UVF hardliners who opposed the UVF's move toward politics. He adds:I believe much of the {{violence}} generated during {{the latter part of}} last year was caused by some of the new [...] people deliberately stirring up the conflict. As you <b>know,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> never been allowed to target the breakaway UVF, nor the UFF, during the past year. Yet they have killed more people than the IRA! ...|$|E
2500|$|All 4 Democratic Presidents of the Cold War era {{employed}} Clifford's {{services and}} relied on his counsel, marking {{him as one}} of the ultimate Washington insiders. Emblematic of Clifford's influence in postwar Democratic presidential administrations was the fact that after Jimmy Carter won the 1976 presidential election, his transition team was adamant that Clifford, {{as a symbol of the}} DC establishment, should not have any influence whatsoever, declaring that [...] "if you ever see us relying on Clark Clifford, you’ll <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> failed", yet Carter eventually came to rely on him nonetheless.|$|E
2500|$|Collins {{begun the}} 2010–11 season in good form and {{has stated that}} he needs to keep {{performing}} well if he is to hold his left back position."There is a lot of competition here now in every area on the pitch, so the lads who are playing at the moment, like myself, <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to keep performing. If we don't then there are options there for the manager to change things" [...] However, he again struggled and was dropped back to the bench with Higginbotham and Marc Wilson being preferred at left back.|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the course}} of his career, Chamberlain became more pessimistic in his conclusions, believing that notions about union-management {{collaboration}} would have scant impact on the corporation's ability to react to external events. [...] He also grew dissatisfied with the development of economic analysis, believing it too formal and beholden to quantitative methods and lacking a value-based look at how corporate management behaved. [...] Indeed, Chamberlain became skeptical about his discipline as a whole. [...] In the context of a 1980 New York Times piece about the hazards of poorly conducted social science research, he was quoted as saying, [...] "We know very little about what we profess to <b>know.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> claimed too much as a profession." [...] He came to have philosophical doubts about the entire study of economics, believing that purposeful action, unforeseen trends, and random occurrences combine to give economic theories that are based upon the observation of what has taken place in the past little predictive ability or policy-making usefulness in terms of what will take place in the future.|$|E
2500|$|If God is ever to {{wipe away}} the tears {{from the face of}} man this age-long wrong [...] must be overthrown. If the mission of Jesus is ever to get the upperhand in human affairs, the social {{revolution}} must come to pass. There is no more good news to the poor unless there is the message and the task to abolish this age-long night of poverty. There is no deliverance for captives unless this social captivity is ended. There is no setting at liberty the people that are bruised unless this age-long bruising machinery is stopped. If we are ever to call the poor and the maimed and the halt to the banquet of creation, the program of the revolution must be inaugurated. The Heavenly Father may <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> need of all these things, and He may have provided for these needs in the limitless resources of nature, but we never can have them for the people except by seeking the kingdom of social justice and human brotherhood — which is the Kingdom of God — which is the social vision of the social revolution.|$|E
2500|$|Moyers {{reported}} and Potter confirmed {{that there were}} attempts to radicalize Moore {{in an effort to}} discredit the film’s message. Moore would be referred to as a [...] "Hollywood entertainer" [...] or [...] "Hollywood moviemaker" [...] to associate the film as being grounded in entertainment without any basis in objective reality. [...] "They would want you to see this as just some fantasy that a Hollywood filmmaker had come up with. That's part of the strategy." [...] Potter said that the strategy worked and the impact of the film was [...] "blunted" [...] by the public relations campaign. He agreed that Sicko contained [...] "a great truth" [...] which he said was [...] "that we shouldn't fear government involvement in our health care system. That there is an appropriate role for government, and it's been proven in the countries that were in that movie. [...] You <b>know,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> more people who are uninsured in this country than the entire population of Canada. And that if you include the people who are underinsured, more people than in the United Kingdom. We have huge numbers of people who are also just a lay-off away from joining the ranks of the uninsured, or being purged by their insurance company, and winding up there." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} {{featured in the}} March 21, 2012 issue of Kerrang! magazine, Bennington stated that the band has returned to more 'familiar' territory on their new record, saying [...] "with this [...] album, we've incorporated a lot of guitar work with big choruses and the heavier electronic stuff to give it that really big wall of sound feeling without getting too metal. This will be more familiar to people than A Thousand Suns was, where we were like 'Fuck it, we're {{just going to go}} bonkers." [...] Bennington also said that the new album's lyrics would be personal and avoid being political, adding [...] "We've been writing a lot about relationships." [...] Bennington and Shinoda echoed similar statements during {{an interview}} with Spin, with the former commenting that [...] "We now <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> the skills and the tools to take those ideas and make them into what we're actually looking for, as opposed to getting into it and discovering that it just sounds really nü-metal. That's always going to be gross to us, but we can take elements of that and reinvent the vibe, make it new and fresh." [...] The two previewed five songs from the album, as well as announced that they had collaborated with Canadian musician Owen Pallett. The vocalists also stated that they have adopted numerous influences and topics for the album, particularly about people.|$|E
