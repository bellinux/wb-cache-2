[...] Many of Wodehouse's parts were stereotypes, and he acknowledged that [...] "a real character in one of my books sticks out like a sore thumb." [...] The publisher Michael Joseph identifies that even within the stereotypes Wodehouse understood human nature, and therefore [...] "shares with [...] Dickens and Charles Chaplin the ability to present the comic resistance of the individual against those superior forces to which we are all subject".|$|E
500|$|... "Disturbia" [...] {{was written}} by American {{recording}} artist Chris Brown and his team which included Brian Kennedy, Rob. A and Andre Merritt, {{better known as the}} Graffiti Artizts. The track was originally considered {{to be part of the}} re-release edition of Brown's second studio album, Exclusive (2007). However, after finishing the song, he took preference to another song, [...] "Forever", which later became the lead single from his re-released album, titled Exclusive: The Forever Edition (2008). He felt that [...] "Disturbia" [...] would be better suited for a female singer and instead forwarded the song to Rihanna. When writing the song, he was inspired [...] "to go totally left and kind of weird". Speaking to USA Today, Brown described his feelings with regard to him giving the song to Rihanna: [...] "It's fun being creative and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a concept in your head to write about, you can write it and give it and give it to someone else because it might not personally fit you, but it might be an idea you have." ...|$|E
500|$|The 808 {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{influential}} inventions in popular music. According to Sound on Sound, the machine [...] "spawned an industry of clones and sample libraries"; samples of its sounds are common in modern music software. Flavorwire wrote that [...] "the 808 has become so ubiquitous over the years that its beats are almost a language of their own â€” you know the sounds <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> no idea what a drum machine is, and as such, you also notice when somebody messes with them or uses them in unusual contexts." [...] The New Yorker wrote in 2015 that the 808 is the bedrock of the modern [...] "urban-youth-culture soundtrack", particularly in trap music, and had influenced a new blend of dance and retro hip hop that [...] "embraces and fetishizes... street music from the past." [...] According to Slate, it was instrumental in pop music's shift from conventional structure and harmonic progression to [...] "thinking in terms of sequences, discrete passages of sound and time to be repeated and revised ad infinitum." ...|$|E

Moreover he would say that, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> evidence, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> something to show that treachery was meant, he would still, in the interest of France, stay at his post of duty." ...|$|R

500|$|After a {{misunderstanding}} over {{an insurance policy}} causes {{the owner of the}} inn where Twoflower and Rincewind are staying to commit arson, the pair flee the city. [...] They proceed across the disc, encountering a variety of mythical creatures, most of which lead to near-death experiences for Rincewind. [...] Fortunately for Rincewind, the Octavo spell in his head precludes him from actually dying, resulting in several comic encounters with Death. Meanwhile, a significant power struggle is occurring within the Unseen University. [...] Narrator Brian Cox explains that [...] "in the competitive world of wizardry, {{the way to the top}} is via dead men's pointy shoes... <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to empty them yourself". [...] The power-hungry wizard Ymper Trymon (Tim Curry) plans to become Archchancellor. Trymon assassinates several faculty members but is thwarted by the incumbent Archchancellor, Galder Weatherwax, and his superior magical knowledge of the Octavo. Trymon knows there is no point in deposing the Archchancellor until he learns how to control the Octavo, which is growing increasingly restless as Rincewind (and the spell in his head) moves further away from Ankh-Morpork and into greater danger.|$|E
500|$|... "Disturbia" [...] is an uptempo electropop song. According to BBC Music's Fraser McAlpine, it is {{reminiscent}} of Rihanna's 2007 single [...] "Don't Stop the Music". McAlpine {{also noted that the}} song has a [...] "frosty-rave" [...] chorus accompanied with Rihanna's [...] "icy" [...] vocals. It was written by Brian Kennedy Seals, Chris Brown, Robert Allen and Andre Merritt for the re-release of Brown's second studio album, Exclusive (2007). However, after finishing the song, Brown took preference to another track, [...] "Forever", which would later be released as the first single from the re-release. He felt that [...] "Disturbia" [...] would be better suited for a female singer and gave it to Rihanna. Kennedy produced [...] "Disturbia", while Makeba Riddick produced Rihanna's vocals. The song was recorded by Andrew Vastola at Rocky Mountain Recorders in Denver, Colorado. It was mixed by Phil Tan at Soapbox Studios in Atlanta, Georgia. Additional engineering was provided by Josh Houghkirk, with assistance from Carlos Oyanedel. Speaking to USA Today, Brown described his feelings about giving [...] "Disturbia" [...] to Rihanna: [...] "It's fun being creative and <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a concept in your head to write about, you can write it and give it and give it to someone else because it might not personally fit you, but it might be an idea you have".|$|E
500|$|Sheila Benson, {{writing for}} the Los Angeles Times, stated, [...] "Intelligent, complex and enthralling, Presumed Innocent ... {{is one of those}} rare films where all the players seem to be in a state of grace, where the working of the {{machinery}} never shows and after it's over, one runs and reruns its intricacies with a profound sense of satisfaction." [...] Peter Travers, writing for Rolling Stone, called the film [...] "a smart, passionate, steadily engrossing thriller". Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised Pakula's direction, writing, [...] "Pakula has directed an intense, enveloping, gratifyingly thorough screen adaptation of Mr. Turow's story." [...] Film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote that film was [...] "a top-notch courtroom drama that will keep you guessing if you haven't read the book; <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have,</b> it is still a very well crafted story." [...] Variety magazine praised the performances, writing, [...] "Ford, in a very mature, subtle, lowkey performance, pulls off the difficult feat of making it impossible to be sure. Bedelia is wondrously controlled, and Scacchi, sans any hint of a European accent, is convincing and seductive." [...] Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune praised the supporting cast, writing, [...] "Raul Julia is excellent as Ford's sinister defense attorney. John Spencer, Joe Grifasi, Tom Mardirosian and Sab Shimono are each compelling as investigator, political lackey, prosecutor and coroner." ...|$|E

2500|$|When he {{came back}} to Australia in 1886/87, Read was flabbergasted at the pickiness of the Australian public, and he wrote of it: [...] "If you have a bit of bad luck and make nothing two or three times, you are not of much account in Australia, and out of the team you should go, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> scored {{excellently}} on occasions."

2500|$|The working {{title for}} the first track [...] "Intro" [...] is [...] "Attempted Assassination". Papoose said he was using the song [...] "more as a {{preparing}} the listener for what type of album, what type of experience they [...] about to have. Iâ€™m just basically setting the stage then an interlude." [...] The intro features samples from Barack Obama and Martin Luther King Jr. speeches. The third track [...] "Mother Ghetto" [...] is about loving and representing where you are from. Papoose being from Brooklyn, New York he said the song will give you and inside look to the city <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> never been there. Papoose would say his Mobb Deep collaboration [...] "Aim, Shoot" [...] was recorded in 2012 even through the feud that went on between members Havoc and Prodigy.

2500|$|Douglas Wolk {{said the}} {{earliest}} Consumer Guide columns were generally brief and detailed, but [...] "within a few years, though, he developed his particular gift for 'power, wit and economy,' a phrase {{he used to}} describe the Ramones in a dead-on 37-word review of Leave Home." [...] In his opinion, the Consumer Guide reviews were [...] "an enormous pleasure to read slowly, as writing, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> no particular interest in pop music.

[...] Fans of Christgau's [...] "Consumer Guide" [...] like to share lines from their favorite reviews, Wolk writes, citing [...] "Sting wears his sexual resentment on his chord changes like a closet 'American Woman' fan" [...] (from Christgau's review of the 1983 Police album Synchronicity); [...] "Calling Neil Tennant a bored wimp is like accusing Jackson Pollock of making a mess" [...] (reviewing the 1987 Pet Shop Boys album Actually); and [...] "Mick Jagger should fold up his penis and go home" [...] (in a review of Prince's 1980 album Dirty Mind).|$|E
2500|$|From 1891 to 1900, Everhard {{served as}} {{president}} of the Ohio Suffrage Association. In 1894, she led the successful effort to secure school suffrage for Ohio women. She also gained for Ohio women the right to vote in municipal elections. She was among the suffrage activists who spoke at a hearing of the House judiciary committee in Washington D. C. in 1896, led by Susan B. Anthony. Everhard's remarks gave her reasons for activism:You probably wonder, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not asked, why we are not at home looking after our families instead of coming to Washington to pester you. It is just because we want to take better care of our homes that we have come. I for one pay enough in taxes every year to buy a farm and yet I have no right to say how they shall be collected or how expended. It is a mistake to say that women do not want the ballot, for in Ohio, where we have been given school suffrage, interest has grown rapidly, and now women who at first did not even want school suffrage have been educated into being full-fledged suffragists." ...|$|E
2500|$|Second, Searle {{believes}} we can rationally {{do things}} that don't result from our own desires. It is widely believed that one cannot derive an [...] "ought" [...] from an [...] "is", i.e. that facts about how the world is can never {{tell you what you}} should do ('Hume's Law'). By contrast, in so far as a fact is understood as relating to an institution (marriage, promises, commitments, etc.), which is to be understood as a system of constitutive rules, then what one should do can be understood as following from the institutional fact of what one has done; institutional fact, then, can be understood as opposed to the [...] "brute facts" [...] related to Hume's Law. For example, Searle believes the fact that you promised to do something means you should do it, because by making the promise you are participating in the constitutive rules that arrange the system of promise making itself, and therefore understand a [...] "shouldness" [...] as implicit in the mere factual action of promising. Furthermore, he believes that this provides a desire-independent reason for an actionâ€”if you order a drink at a bar, you should pay for it <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> no desire to. This argument, which he first made in his paper, [...] "How to Derive 'Ought' from 'Is'" [...] (1964), remains highly controversial, but even three decades later Searle continued to defend his view that [...] "..the traditional metaphysical distinction between fact and value cannot be captured by the linguistic distinction between 'evaluative' and 'descriptive' because all such speech act notions are already normative." ...|$|E

2500|$|The young priestess enters, {{concerned}} at how pale Norma looks. Norma makes her swear {{to do everything}} she asks and, upon her agreement, tells her that she is entrusting the two children to her care and states {{that they should be}} taken to the Roman camp to their father Pollione, a man whom she hopes will make a better mate for Adalgisa than he was for her. [...] Adalgisa is aghast. Norma: [...] "I beg you for his children's sake." [...] (Duet, first Norma: Deh! con te, con te li prendi, Li sostieni, li difendi / [...] "Please, take them with you, support them and protect them; I don't ask you for honour or power, let that be kept for your own children.") Adalgisa tells her that she'll never leave Gaul and only agreed to the request in order to do what was good for Norma. (Duet, Adalgisa: Vado al campo, ed all'ingrato Tutti io reco i tuoi lamenti.) In the duet, Adalgisa agrees to go to the Roman camp and tell Pollione of Norma's grief but her hope is to persuade him to return to Norma. She then renounces Pollione: (Duet: Mira, o Norma / [...] "O Norma, look at your dear children of yours on your knees. Be moved by pity for them, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> no pity for yourself.") They sing together, each expressing her own thoughts and feelings until Norma realises that Adalgisa will give up Pollione and remain with her: (Cabaletta: Duet, Norma and Adalgisa: Si fino all'ore estreme, compagna tua m'avrai / [...] "Yes, you will have me as your friend until your last hour; the world is large enough to be a shelter to both of us together.") ...|$|E
