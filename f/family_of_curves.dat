25|$|If we {{take the}} one-parameter {{subgroup}} generated by any loxodromic Möbius transformation, we obtain a continuous transformation, such that every transformation in the subgroup fixes the same two points. All other points flow along a certain <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>curves,</b> away from the first fixed point and toward the second fixed point. Unlike the hyperbolic case, these curves are not circular arcs, but certain curves which under stereographic projection from the sphere to the plane appear as spiral curves which twist counterclockwise infinitely often around one fixed point and twist clockwise infinitely often around the other fixed point. In general, the two fixed points may be any two distinct points on the Riemann sphere.|$|E
25|$|Viscoelastic creep {{data can}} be {{presented}} {{in one of two}} ways. Total strain can be plotted as a function of time for a given temperature or temperatures. Below a critical value of applied stress, a material may exhibit linear viscoelasticity. Above this critical stress, the creep rate grows disproportionately faster. The second way of graphically presenting viscoelastic creep in a material is by plotting the creep modulus (constant applied stress divided by total strain at a particular time) as a function of time. Below its critical stress, the viscoelastic creep modulus is independent of stress applied. A <b>family</b> <b>of</b> <b>curves</b> describing strain versus time response to various applied stress may be represented by a single viscoelastic creep modulus versus time curve if the applied stresses are below the material's critical stress value.|$|E

Multiple simulation runs or multiple measurements of the same physical quantity result in ensem-bles <b>of</b> <b>curves</b> which we call <b>families</b> <b>of</b> <b>curves.</b> The analysis <b>of</b> time-series data is extensively studied in mathematics, statistics, and visualization; but less research is focused on the analysis <b>of</b> <b>families</b> <b>of</b> <b>curves.</b> Interactive visual analysis in combination with a complex data model, which supports <b>families</b> <b>of</b> <b>curves</b> in addition to scalar parameters, repre-sents a premium methodology for such an analysis. In this paper we describe the three levels of complexity of interac-tive visual analysis we identified during several case studies. The first two levels represent the current state of the art. The newly introduced third level makes extracting deeply hidden implicit information from complex data sets possi-ble by adding data derivation and advanced interaction.

[...] It is employed by arithmetically adding a table of values, listed by octave or third-octave bands, to the measured sound pressure levels in dB. The resulting octave band measurements are usually added (logarithmic method) to provide a single A-weighted value describing the sound; the units are written as dB(A).
