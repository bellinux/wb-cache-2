5|$|During July 2017, Governor Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio disputed who has {{control of}} the subway system. Cuomo claimed that since the subway system was owned by New York City and leased to the MTA, the city had {{to pay more for}} its capital needs. However, de Blasio argued that <b>his</b> <b>large</b> $2.5 billion {{contribution}} was enough.|$|E
5|$|Having secured his party's nomination, Tydings {{moved forward}} to face Beall {{in the general}} {{election}}. The final election results gave Tydings nearly 63% of 1,081,042 votes cast. <b>His</b> <b>large</b> margin of victory was due {{at least in part}} to the landslide win by fellow Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson for President in the same election, which likely increased voter turnout.|$|E

5|$|In his globes of 1612, van Langeren {{incorporated}} the improvements made by Hondius the Elder to Molyneux's globe. It {{is believed that}} the Hondius globes also spurred Willem Blaeu to start constructing <b>his</b> <b>large</b> globes in 1616, which were published in 1622. Molyneux's globes therefore may have indirectly influenced the evolution of Dutch globe-making.|$|E

5|$|Bede wrote Ecgbert {{a letter}} dealing with monastic {{issues as well}} as the {{problems}} of large dioceses. The letter, written in 734, became known as the Epistola ad Ecgberhtum episcopum. Bede urged Ecgbert to study Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care, and held up Aidan and Cuthbert as examples of model bishops. The main thrust of Bede's letter was to urge Ecgbert to reform his church to more closely resemble Gregory the Great's original plan for it. Bede's admonition to divide up dioceses fell on deaf ears, as Egbert did not break up <b>his</b> <b>large</b> diocese. The suffragans continued to be limited to the bishops of Hexham, Lindisfarne, and Whithorn.|$|E

5|$|Born François-Marie Arouet, Voltaire (1694–1778), by {{the time}} of the Lisbon earthquake, was already a {{well-established}} author, known for his satirical wit. He had been made a member of the Académie Française in 1746. He was a deist, a strong proponent of religious freedom, and a critic of tyrannical governments. Candide became part of <b>his</b> <b>large,</b> diverse body of philosophical, political and artistic works expressing these views. More specifically, it was a model for the eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century novels called the contes philosophiques. This genre, of which Voltaire was one of the founders, included previous works of his such as Zadig and Micromegas.|$|E
5|$|Captain Renaudin {{was said}} in a naval {{registry}} to have swum to safety. He had in fact abandoned his ship with the first British boat, leaving his men behind in disregard for military customs and the 1765 standing order that Captains had to be last to abandon ship, and though his account insinuates {{that he was on}} a boat close to Vengeur when she foundered, he was actually dining in the mess of Culloden at the moment of the sinking. In 1795, Loutherbourg depicted the rescue of Vengeurs crew by British ships in <b>his</b> <b>large</b> canvas of the battle, Lord Howe's action, or the Glorious First of June.|$|E
5|$|Darius' initial {{response}} was defensive: he immediately stockaded the river bank with stakes to impede the enemy's crossing. A core vanguard of traitorous Greek mercenaries and Persian royal guard was established; as was usual for Persian kings, Darius positioned {{himself in the}} centre of this vanguard, in order that he might effectively dispatch commands to any part of <b>his</b> <b>large</b> army. A group of Persian light infantry was soon sent to the foothills, as it was suspected that Alexander would make an approach from the right, away from the coast. A mass of cavalry commanded by Nabarsanes occupied the Persian right.|$|E

5|$|Despite <b>his</b> <b>large</b> {{number of}} {{successful}} plays, Planché was never particularly wealthy, {{and he felt}} pressure from needing to support his grandchildren. Circumstances improved when in 1871 he was awarded a civil list pension of £100 per annum 'in recognition of his literary services'. Planché died {{at his home in}} Chelsea on 30 May 1880 at the age of 84. His wealth {{at the time of his}} death was under £1000.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>his</b> <b>large</b> {{number of}} works on Christian themes, Britten has {{sometimes}} been thought of as agnostic. Pears said that when they met in 1937 {{he was not sure}} whether or not Britten would have described himself as a Christian. In the 1960s Britten called himself a dedicated Christian, though sympathetic to the radical views propounded by the Bishop of Woolwich in Honest to God. Politically, Britten was on the left. He told Pears that he always voted either Liberal or Labour and could not imagine ever voting Conservative, but he was never a member of any party, except the Peace Pledge Union.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel Fauré {{composed}} his Requiem in D minor, Op. 48, between 1887 and 1890. The choral-orchestral {{setting of}} the shortened Catholic Mass for the Dead in Latin is the best-known of <b>his</b> <b>large</b> works. Its focus is on eternal rest and consolation. Fauré's reasons for composing the work are unclear, but {{do not appear to}} have {{had anything to do with}} the death of his parents in the mid-1880s. He composed the work in the late 1880s and revised it in the 1890s, finishing it in 1900.|$|E

5|$|He {{spend much}} of his fortune on {{political}} activism, and was nearly bankrupt {{by the time of}} his death. In February 1790, despite his objections, he was pressured, through general public demand, into reelection for a second (yearly) term of office as the mayor of Warsaw. It is likely that major reasons he preferred not to have been elected were his ailing business operations and his worsening health. He led his last public debate on 31 April 1790, and withdrew from politics afterward. He died on 4 October 1790 in Warsaw. He was buried in St. John's Archcathedral, and <b>his</b> <b>large</b> funeral was paid for by the City of Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|Hinde {{purchased}} {{a portion of}} M'Intosh's litigated property {{not long after the}} litigation. Correspondence between Hinde and M'Intosh discussing land sales form part of the Hinde documents at the Lyman Draper Manuscripts Collection in the Wisconsin Historical Society. Due to the favorable ruling in the case, Hinde benefited greatly because of <b>his</b> <b>large</b> land holdings in the area. After the ruling had settled ownership issues between the Indians and settlers, Hinde founded the towns of Mt. Carmel, Powhaten, and Selima in the Illinois territory.|$|E
5|$|In 1826, Wilberforce {{moved from}} <b>his</b> <b>large</b> house in Kensington Gore to Highwood Hill, {{a more modest}} {{property}} in the countryside of Mill Hill, north of London, where he was soon joined by his son William and family. William had attempted a series of educational and career paths, and a venture into farming in 1830 led to huge losses, which his father repaid in full, despite offers from others to assist. This left Wilberforce with little income, and he was obliged to let his home and {{spend the rest of}} his life visiting family members and friends. He continued his support for the anti-slavery cause, including attending and chairing meetings of the Anti-Slavery Society.|$|E
