5|$|On January 18, 1977, the Dade County Commission {{approved}} {{a law that}} would outlaw {{discrimination on the basis of}} sexual orientation in employment, housing, and public services. Commissioner Ruth Shack proposed the bill on December 7, 1976 at the request of a gay lobbying organization, named the Dade County Coalition for the Humanistic Rights of Gays, that was less than a year old. The group was headed by three gay activists: Jack Campbell, an owner of 40gay bathhouses across the United States, political and <b>gay</b> <b>activist</b> Bob Basker, and Bob Kunst, a local publicist and enthusiast of the Human Potential Movement.|$|E

50|$|The {{group was}} founded on April 20, 1971, {{evolving}} from Frank Kameny's Congressional campaign. In 1970, Congress allowed the District of Columbia to elect a non-voting representative to the House of Representatives. A group of <b>gay</b> <b>activists</b> in the District of Columbia thought {{that none of the}} candidates showed enough attention to gay issues, so with help from the <b>Gay</b> <b>Activists</b> Alliance from New York City, volunteers collected over 7,000 signatures to add Kameny as a candidate. Though Kameny was not elected, his supporters turned the political campaign into what was then called the <b>Gay</b> <b>Activists</b> Alliance. Paul Kuntzler and Joel Martin, both <b>gay</b> rights <b>activists,</b> played large roles {{in the creation of the}} Alliance, modeling it after New York's <b>Gay</b> <b>Activists</b> Alliance. Rick Rosendall, the Vice President for Political Affairs, contacted Kameny and joined in the late 1970s.|$|R
5|$|<b>Gay</b> <b>activists,</b> newly {{alarmed at}} {{the threat to}} their rights, confronted vice {{president}} Walter Mondale at a political rally in San Francisco {{two weeks after the}} announcement of Proposition 6. Mondale ran with Jimmy Carter in 1976 on a platform highlighting human rights as their first priority, and he was there to address the subject pertaining to Latin America. When <b>gay</b> <b>activists</b> interrupted him and demanded he address their issues, he quickly left without a response, and San Francisco Democratic organizers and liberal politicians were furious at the <b>gay</b> <b>activists.</b>|$|R

25|$|In a {{documentary}} first broadcast on Israeli television in October 2010, Skaat {{stated that he}} is gay. The statement came after years of public speculation about Skaat's sexual orientation and after a controversial public outing by Israeli film producer and <b>gay</b> <b>activist,</b> Gal Uchovsky, after Skaat performed at a July 2010 memorial to mark the one-year anniversary of {{an attack on a}} Tel Aviv gay youth center.|$|E
25|$|Colin was a middle-classed, well-meaning, {{slightly}} uptight yuppie, and his inclusion was {{an attempt}} to portray the gentrification of the East End of London. The openly gay actor and <b>gay</b> <b>activist</b> Michael Cashman, who had roots in the East End, was chosen to play the role. Cashman initially resisted playing Colin, but was persuaded by his boyfriend, Paul Cottingham, and after receiving his parents' backing, he accepted the part.|$|E
25|$|On 26 January 2011, Uganda's most {{prominent}} <b>gay</b> <b>activist,</b> David Kato, was found bludgeoned {{to death in}} what authorities in Uganda characterised as a robbery. His photograph had been published in Rolling Stone. Kato had spoken at a United Nations-sponsored conference on the bill in December 2009, although his words were barely audible because he was nervous. Information in US embassy cables revealed that Ugandan human rights activists and anti-homosexuality bill supporters vocally mocked him during his presentation.|$|E

25|$|Later {{that same}} day in New York <b>gay</b> <b>activist</b> groups held their own pride parade, known as the Christopher Street Liberation Day, to recall the events of Stonewall one year earlier. On November 2, 1969, Craig Rodwell, his partner Fred Sargeant, Ellen Broidy, and Linda Rhodes {{proposed}} the first gay pride parade {{to be held in}} New York City by way of a resolution at the Eastern Regional Conference of Homophile Organizations (ERCHO) meeting in Philadelphia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gay</b> <b>activist</b> Jonathan Rauch {{has argued}} that {{marriage}} is good for all men, whether homosexual or heterosexual, because engaging in its social roles reduces men's aggression and promiscuity. The data of current psychological and other social science studies on same-sex marriage in comparison to mixed-sex marriage indicate that same-sex and mixed-sex relationships do not differ in their essential psychosocial dimensions; that a parent's sexual orientation is unrelated {{to their ability to}} provide a healthy and nurturing family environment; and that marriage bestows substantial psychological, social, and health benefits. Same-sex parents and carers and their children are likely to benefit in numerous ways from legal recognition of their families, and providing such recognition through marriage will bestow greater benefit than civil unions or domestic partnerships.|$|E
25|$|It Gets Better is an Internet-based 501(c)3 nonprofit {{founded in}} the United States by <b>gay</b> <b>activist,</b> author, media pundit, and {{journalist}} Dan Savage and his husband Terry Miller on September 21, 2010, {{in response to the}} suicides of teenagers who were bullied because they were gay or because their peers suspected that they were gay. Its goal is to prevent suicide among LGBT youth by having gay adults convey the message that these teens' lives will improve. The project has grown rapidly: over 200 videos were uploaded in the first week, and the project's YouTube channel reached the 650 video limit in the next week. The project is now organized on its own website, the It Gets Better Project, and includes more than 50,000 entries from people of all sexual orientations, including many celebrities; the videos have received over 50 million views.|$|E

25|$|Papaioannou first {{attracted}} {{attention as}} a visual artist, illustrator and comic book creator. He presented his art work {{at a number of}} exhibitions, produced illustrations for numerous magazines, and designed and co-edited the countercultural fanzine Kontrosol sto Haos (1986–1992), one of the few publications to include openly gay content at that time in Greece. He also contributed to the Greek <b>gay</b> <b>activist</b> magazine To Kraximo (1981–1994) in the early 1980s, and gave an interview to the publication in 1993. Moreover, he published over 40 comics in Greek alternative comics magazines such as Babel and Para Pende, many of which incorporated gay themes and explicit images (such as 1986's Rock 'n' Roll, 1988's My Ex-Boyfriend, and 1993's Heart-Shaped Earth). He was awarded first prize in a competition organised by Marseille Public Transport Authority at the 5th Biennial of Young Artists from Europe and the Mediterranean, held in Marseille in 1990, for his comic Un Bon Plan.|$|E
25|$|As the Constitutional Convention {{concluded}} {{its work}} on the amendment, some politicians announced plans to make the November 2004 elections a referendum on same-sex marriage. In Vermont following the enactment of civil unions legislation in 2000, {{a large group of}} its supporters had been defeated. One political action committee announced plans to target legislative candidates who supported same-sex marriage, eight Republicans and two independents. Ronald Crews of the Massachusetts Family Institute estimated a possible shift of 10 to 15 seats against same-sex marriage. The elections resulted in shifts that consistently favored supporters of same-sex marriage rights. Carl Sciortino, a <b>gay</b> <b>activist</b> and first-time candidate, drew support from supporters of same-sex marriage, but ran largely on traditional issues like education, taxation, and health-care, and narrowly defeated a 16-year veteran and same-sex marriage opponent in the Democratic primary on September 14. Later that month, Speaker of the House Finneran resigned from the legislature to be replaced by Sal DiMasi, who backed same-sex marriage. Some candidates who backed a constitutional amendment did not make same-sex marriage a campaign issue as anticipated, but it proved critical in a few races. All 50 incumbents who opposed a constitutional amendment and faced challengers won re-election. Four supporters of Goodridge retired and successors with similar views replaced them. Five opponents of Goodridge retired and three of their successors were supporters of same-sex marriage. In special elections in the spring of 2005, three incumbents who supported a constitutional amendment lost to supporters of same-sex marriage.|$|E
500|$|He has a {{reputation}} for being brash, even rude, when it comes to discussing gay concerns, especially gay sex. Matthías Matthíasson, Director of Samtökin '78, Iceland's gay and lesbian rights group, has commented: [...] "He says things I could never say. But he is an exquisite addition to the gay voice in Iceland." [...] As a <b>gay</b> <b>activist,</b> Paul Oscar helped to organize a Gay Pride Festival in Reykjavík in 2005.|$|E

500|$|In The New York Times, {{conservative}} columnist William Safire {{wrote that}} Miami's <b>gay</b> <b>activists</b> had been justifiably defeated: [...] "In {{the eyes of}} the vast majority, homosexuality is an abnormality, a mental illness, even—to use an old-fashioned word—a sin. Homosexuality is not the 'alternative lifestyle' the <b>gay</b> <b>activists</b> profess; it may be tolerable, even acceptable—but not approvable." [...] Safire, however, tempered the column (titled [...] "Now Ease Up, Anita") cautioning against Bryant's promised nationwide crusade designed to lead to further repeal of homosexuals' [...] "legitimate civil rights".|$|R

500|$|Several suicides were {{connected}} to the campaign, including a Cuban <b>gay</b> <b>activist</b> in Miami named Ovidio [...] "Herbie" [...] Ramos, who was stunned at the vehemence against homosexuals. He and several other Cuban gay activists participated in a radio call-in show to hear people say homosexuals should be deported, forced into concentration camps, or executed. Ramos shot himself {{a few days later}} after telling a friend, [...] "I didn't know they hated us so much". Another Cuban <b>gay</b> <b>activist</b> named Manolo Gomez was fired from his job and severely beaten, after which he decided to leave Miami. Gay activists in New Orleans tried to discourage Bryant's performance with the New Orleans Pops orchestra by connecting local suicides to her campaign. Bryant responded to violence saying, [...] "It made me sad and shocked me that anyone would think I {{had anything to do with}} it, but my conscience is clear. I can't be responsible for how people react to what happened in Dade County. My stand was not taken out of homophobia, but of love for them." ...|$|E
500|$|Thorpe never {{discussed}} his sexuality publicly, although throughout {{his political career}} he led a double life—responsible politician by day while, according to Murray, [...] "by night {{he was not only}} very gay but rather carefree about being so." [...] The writer and broadcaster Jonathan Fryer, who was a <b>gay</b> <b>activist</b> within the Liberal Party in the 1970s, maintained that in the repressive climate of the time Thorpe [...] "couldn't have come out, even if he'd wanted to". However, his double standard irritated and alienated the gay Liberals: [...] "He wanted the best of both worlds—his fun and a family." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{growth of}} lesbian {{feminism}} in the 1970s at times so conflicted with the gay liberation movement that some lesbians refused {{to work with}} gay men. Many lesbians found men's attitudes patriarchal and chauvinistic, and saw in gay men the same misguided notions about women as they saw in heterosexual men. The issues most important to gay men—entrapment and public solicitation—were not shared by lesbians. In 1977 a Lesbian Pride Rally was organized {{as an alternative to}} sharing gay men's issues, especially what Adrienne Rich termed [...] "the violent, self-destructive world of the gay bars". Veteran <b>gay</b> <b>activist</b> Barbara Gittings chose to work in the gay rights movement, rationalizing [...] "It's a matter of where does it hurt the most? For me it hurts the most not in the female arena, but the gay arena." ...|$|E

To campaign for the civil rights of Wiccans, he founded the Witches Anti-Defamation League, which was later renamed the Alternative Religions Education Network. In 1973, he visited England, there being initiated into Gardnerian Wicca by the Gardnerian High Priestess Patricia Crowther. He continued practicing Wicca into the 1990s, when he retreated from public life, eventually succumbing to cancer in 2000.|$|E

500|$|At the 1963 {{convention}} of the newly formed East Coast Homophile Organizations, the audience heard a speaker named Dr. Albert Ellis tell them that [...] "the exclusive homosexual" [...] was a psychopath. Articles and essays in The Ladder sometimes carried these viewpoints, since {{it was difficult to}} get psychiatrists and doctors to address homosexuality in any form. Gittings said, [...] "People like Ellis talked about homosexuality being a sickness. And they talked about a cure...We'd sit there and listen and politely applaud and then go for the social hour afterward." [...] However, after Dr. Ellis spoke, so did <b>gay</b> <b>activist</b> Frank Kameny, making an impression upon Gittings with his point that it is useless to try to find cures and causes for homosexuality since there is no valid evidence that it is an illness. Said Gittings, [...] "My thinking didn't change until Frank Kameny came along and he said plainly and firmly and unequivocally that homosexuality is no kind of sickness or disease or disorder or malfunction, it is fully on par with heterosexuality...Suddenly I found that I was looking at things that had happened in the past in a very different light and I was taking a position that was increasingly diverging from DOB’s positions." ...|$|E
