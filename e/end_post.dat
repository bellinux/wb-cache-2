5000|$|Cable Tension: An {{incredible}} amount of tension is generated on the <b>end</b> <b>posts</b> when ten or more cables, each tensioned at 200-400 lbs. over a height of 36" [...] to 42” exists. Underestimating the tension of cables applied to end poles can cause a safety hazard. Cable can have too much deflection allowing body parts to slip through, or cables can merely [...] "pull out" [...] of the end fittings, causing the cable rail to fail. Poorly designed <b>end</b> <b>posts</b> {{will result in a}} railing where the cables cannot be properly tensioned without an unacceptable amount of cable deflection. <b>End</b> <b>posts</b> to which the tensioning hardware attaches must be constructed so that they will not deflect perceptibly.|$|R
50|$|The aim of {{the game}} is to hit the ball across the court three times {{from one end to the}} other, each time hitting the post at the {{opposite}} end. So a player starts at the starting end and aims to hit the post at the scoring end. He or she then reverses play to hit the ball from the scoring <b>end</b> <b>post</b> back to starting <b>end</b> <b>post</b> and finally one more shot across the court from the starting post to the scoring post. The idea is to use just three strokes; one for each length of the court. The posts are set at an angle of 85% towards each other, so that the balls don’t jump when they hit the posts.|$|E

50|$|It is {{identified}} {{by the presence of}} multiple diagonal members projecting down {{from the top of the}} end posts at a variety of angles. These diagonal members extend to the bottom of each of the vertical members of the truss with the longest diagonal extending to the center vertical member. Many Fink trusses do not include a lower chord (the lowest horizontal member). This gives the bridge an unfinished saw-toothed appearance when viewed from the side or below, and makes the design very easy to identify. If the bridge deck is carried along the bottom of the truss (called a through truss) or if a lightweight lower chord is present, identification is made solely by the multiple diagonal members emanating from the <b>end</b> <b>post</b> tops.|$|E

The first indication that ABC was running a miniseries appeared in a brief article in the New York Post. In it, the producers identified shooting locations and revealed that Harvey Keitel would play John O'Neill. At the time, ABC had a working name of Untitled Commission Report and the producers used the working title Untitled History Project, with the project beginning filming in July 2005 and scheduled to <b>end</b> <b>post</b> production by January 2006. Preview screenings were made in May for foreign broadcasters. The film was first publicly announced at the Television Critics Association summer press tour in July.|$|E

5000|$|The orderly room {{appears to}} have been {{initially}} set on the north-east boundary of the site (with a single set of steps to the verandah), before being shifted to the south-west boundary by 1934. A new wing was added to the north-west end of the orderly room before 1946, forming an [...] "L" [...] shaped building, and another extension occurred at the south-east <b>end</b> <b>post</b> 1962. In 1963 it was occupied by a Royal Australian Army Nursing Corps (RAANC) training unit, and in 2011 it was used as offices by the Endeavour College. In 2013, as part of approved demolition, the twentieth century extensions were demolished and the building relocated adjacent to the south-western side of the drill shed, set off from it about two metres.|$|E
50|$|New Henniker Bridge or New Bridge was {{a covered}} bridge in West Hopkinton, New Hampshire, which carried Henniker Road over the Contoocook River. The truss bridge was {{completed}} in 1863, and was the second bridge on the site. The original stone arch bridge was built in 1845 and was washed away by flood in 1852. The bridge was just over 20 ft wide and 180 ft long, and consisted of a single span supported by two triple lattice trusses resting on granite abutments. The patent drawings show an all-timber truss with fixed intersection angles {{in the center of}} the span. At the ends of the span the angles of the diagonals vary. The <b>end</b> <b>post</b> is vertical, and each brace further from it is sloped a little more.|$|E

50|$|Though it was {{designed}} by Wendell Bollman, it does not employ his famous Bollman truss, but rather a Warren truss. It is 81 ft long and 13 ft wide. The east abutments are constructed of concrete, while the west are earthen with wood ties. This bridge has a wood deck, and ornate cast iron end pieces, lacework, and compression members. <b>End</b> <b>posts</b> and tension members are constructed of wrought iron.|$|R
50|$|The {{fountain}} is a {{white marble}} structure in the Italian Renaissance style. In the forefront is a circular pool leading up one level to another pool which is clover-shaped with three marble blocks in the center, each with a water spout. At {{the top of the}} fountain is an arch carved into cattails and water lilies over a niche containing a marble turtle straddled by two stylized fish. From the mouths of the figures water spouts lead to a vase-like pool beneath. Three steps lead from the clover-shaped pool to a balustrade {{on either side of the}} arch. The balusters are decorated with glyphs, four lion heads, and two gargoyles at the huge end posts; all of which spout water into the clover-shaped pool. Two scrolls dip from each post to the wall which surrounds the lower circular pool. Another small pool lies behind the arch and two small fountains hang off each <b>end</b> <b>post</b> of the balustrade.|$|E
50|$|In late 1992, a {{drunk driver}} crashed into an <b>end</b> <b>post</b> on the bridge, {{resulting}} in its closure for part of 1993. Residents complained about having to detour a significant distance, so the bridge was reopened by the county road commission with a 4 ST weight limit, preventing its use by heavy vehicles. However, abutment stones continued to dislodge themselves, and the bridge was again closed to traffic. In 1995, the road commission requested funds from the state's Critical Bridge Fund for {{the replacement of the}} bridge with a two-lane concrete structure. However, residents wished to see the bridge repaired, and they successfully convinced the road commission to not seek replacement. They also pushed for listing the bridge on the National Register of Historic Places; the bridge was listed on November 29, 1996. It is the third oldest known bridge built by the Wrought Iron Bridge Company still in existence. It also one of about ten metal through truss bridges in Michigan that date from the nineteenth century.|$|E
5000|$|A Hampshire gate {{occupies}} a gateway in a fence {{similar to that}} used for a conventional gate. However, instead of a rigid gate, a short section of loose wire fence fits into the gap [...] - [...] this may consist of wire netting or barbed wire, and it usually matches the adjacent fence. One end of the wire is attached permanently to the main fence, and two or more short posts or battens keep it upright and flat [...] - [...] one of these is at the loose end. When the [...] "gate" [...] is closed, this <b>end</b> <b>post</b> fits into a loop of wire {{at the base of the}} fixed fence, and the top is then pulled tight to tension it. The top of the post may be held by another loop of wire, or additional tension may be provided by a length of chain looped around the post and hooked onto a nail. Proprietary closures are also available which give still greater tension, usually by means of an over-centre mechanism (see photo below).|$|E
5000|$|The Atherton Bridge has iron {{compression}} posts that incline inward {{towards the}} center of the span and diagonal tension rods that incline outward towards the abutments. Unusual features include double <b>end</b> <b>posts</b> with adjustable turnbuckles, channeled castings to join the lower chord bars, and patented [...] "Phoenix" [...] columns for all inclined posts.
