40|$|The {{following}} {{article examines}} {{some of the}} initial experiences of Member States with the <b>integrated</b> <b>territorial</b> <b>investment</b> (ITI) tool. It draws from examples of ITI in Belgium (Limburg) and Finland (Six Cities) which are already in advanced stages of planning. The article highlights the versatility of ITI as an implementation tool for integrated territorial approaches but also considers key challenges in relation to administrative and institutional capacity, territorial competitiveness, limited scale of resource allocations, and ambiguities in relation to implementation requirements...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this article}} is to analyse the role and {{importance}} of <b>Integrated</b> <b>Territorial</b> <b>Investment</b> (ITI) as the instrument for the management of transport security in the four largest cities of Lower Silesia: Wrocław, Wałbrzych, Legnica and Jelenia Góra. The doubt concerning the potential connected with using ITI is reasonable in the sense that it creates a completely new, previously unknown, mechanism for the implementation of EU cohesion policy. The conducted analysis, covering the level of strategic management, does not allow for a full confirmation of the formulated hypotheses, for two reasons. Firstly, only three out of the four cities in question (Wrocław, Wałbrzych and Jelenia Góra) use ITI in the management of transport security. Secondly, although the use of ITI complements the assumptions of Poland’s National Urban Policy (NUP), which highlights the importance of strategic programming and a multimodal approach in the management of transport security, the scale of this usage is the same as in the case of those cities with integrated, detailed transport strategies, as well as cities without such strategies...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} 20 years the EU has {{implemented}} {{a wide range}} of initiatives on urban policy and urban matters more generally; a ‘European Urban Agenda’ has emerged and gradually the European Commission is working to ‘create’ a ‘consensus’ that may one day become an explicit EU urban policy. Indeed it may be that this is why the term Acquis Urbain has been increasingly used to suggest the building of a common European methodology of intervention, a body of knowledge and ‘good practices’ that resembles the Acquis Communautaire. This article suggests that the in the new period of cohesion policy there is the potential for a greater emphasis on the ‘urban dimension’. However, much depends on the negotiations between the European Commission and the Member States. Equally important is how Member States interpret guidance from the Commission (notably the Common Strategic Framework) and utilise specific new instruments (e. g. integrated sustainable urban development; <b>Integrated</b> <b>Territorial</b> <b>Investment)</b> and embed these within Partnership Agreements and then the ways in which managing authorities develop and implement Operational Programmes. Moreover, the role of cities in this process will also be important, will they simply be treated as ‘passive beneficiaries’ or active articipants...|$|E

This article presents an issue of implementation of the territorial dimension in cohesion policy. The spatial concentration of resources allocated to rural development under the Regional Operational Programme for the Lower Silesia 2007 - 2013 was analysed. Furthermore, the documents’ analysis to determine development opportunities for these areas in the new financial perspective were undertaken.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{institutional}} and factual readiness of cities and villages in the Czech Republic to use <b>Integrated</b> <b>Territorial</b> <b>Investments</b> (ITI). On {{the basis of a}} questionnaire survey carried out in May 2014 among representatives of 69 municipalities around the core cities of Brno, Jihlava, Olomouc and Hradec Králové - Pardubice as well as a comparison of several model agglomerations, it identifies the main problems and proposes solutions to them. The main theme {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the formation of partnerships of municipalities and the process of creating integrated strategies for metropolitan areas. The paper also {{deals with the}} relationships and functional links between cities and villages and their hinterland, the common development issues and the existing structures of cooperation and communication.

40|$|The growing {{awareness}} of functional linkages between rural and urban territories {{has led to a}} re-thinking of the rural-urban dichotomy. This was flanked by a more general reconceptualization of space, directly coming from the rise of spatial planning and the shifting process from government to governance. Thus, the concept of “soft space” came to the fore, defined as the space of governance and integrated approach. The EU Commission has launched a new instrument aimed at fostering the territorial approach of the new Cohesion Policy, namely the <b>Integrated</b> <b>Territorial</b> <b>Investment</b> (ITI). This research wants to investigate the added value of the ITI instrument in governing and institutionalizing the rural-urban linkages at the metropolitan level. In doing so, the author has created a conceptual framework based on three main concepts directly coming from the concept of soft space, namely institutionalization, governance capacity, and integrated approach. The empirical study is focused on Poland, in particular, dealing with the case of Warsaw, Krakow, and Wroclaw. As a result, this research argues that the ITI in Poland has represented an attempt to improve the cooperation between capital cities and their surrounding areas, even though its outcomes can be questionable...|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} Programming Period (2014 - 2020) the European Commission has {{introduced}} a new strategic instrument, the <b>Integrated</b> <b>Territorial</b> <b>Investment</b> (ITI), which shifts the decisions on allocation of funds to the local level and, most importantly, enables drawing of funds from several priority axes and from several European Structural and Investment Funds. Greece is one of EU member countries that has committed on using ITIs {{as a tool for}} urban development. In August 2016, in the Region of Central Macedonia, urban authorities with a population of over 10. 000 inhabitants were invited by the Managing Authority of the Regional Operational Programme to submit a Strategy for Sustainable Urban Development (SUD), through the mandatory implementation of the ITI tool. The paper focuses on one of these municipalities, the city of Veria, where the ITI approach has been implemented for the design of an ITI of urban scale (ITI-SUD). The integrated approach prescribed by regional authorities forced Municipalities to adopt government approaches uncommon until now: to involve multiple stakeholders in the entire process, from strategy development to project selection and implementation. The paper describes the benefits and challenges of the new approach as applied in the local context, showing the vertical and horizontal connections of urban development strategies. Most importantly, in the context of ‘procedural learning’ happening in Europe in the field of territorial cohesion, it offers an insight on how European cohesion policy strategies and tools are tested at the local level...|$|E

40|$|The Cohesion policy {{regulations}} for the 2014 - 20 programme period provide a new framework for supporting <b>integrated</b> <b>territorial</b> development approaches in the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF). In {{the context of}} European Regional Development Fund, some of these approaches are obligatory (i. e. ring-fenced budgets for urban development) whereas others are voluntary (e. g. <b>Integrated</b> <b>Territorial</b> <b>Investments</b> and Community-led Local Development). These approaches {{are part of a}} longer term shift and reflect increased awareness of place-based theory in policy aspirations, recognising that an integrated mix of policy interventions is needed to fully exploit development potential of territories. Besides finding more efficient and targeted ways to implement territorial development policies, such approaches reflect the new commitment to territorial cohesion in the EU Treaty and ambitions to give local actors greater influence and decision-making powers in local economic development plans. Drawing on cross-national evidence from across the EU, this paper examines {{the extent to which these}} place-based approaches are being implemented effectively, variations in approaches across EU countries and the underlying causal factors (including path dependence, bureaucratic politics, administrative capacity and regulatory tensions). More generally, the paper examines the potential of the new instruments to contribute to territorial de velopment in the post-crisis period and to a re-configuration of territorial governance in Europe by increasing the role of local authorities in Cohesion polic...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present the genesis and the {{development}} of two models of the “leading path” to the integrated management of functional urban areas of voivodeship centres (FUA VC) in Poland in the context of the implementation of the new instrument of the EU’s Cohesion Policy – <b>Integrated</b> <b>Territorial</b> <b>Investments</b> (ITIs). The implementation of ITIs is presented in the light of the inter-commune cooperation in FUA VC, which has been realised variously so far. As examples of the “leading path” to the integrated management based on the ITI, two functional areas have been selected, differing in this respect, Poznań in western Poland (an example of a bottom-up model) and Lublin in its eastern part (an example of a top-down model). In the conclusion, the instrument of ITI was evaluated as a factor which initiates, deepens or complicates the cooperation of local governments in FUAs. It has been emphasised, that in spite of the creation of organisational and financial instruments (ITIs) which activate the cooperation of self-governments in functional areas, one must take into account the need for legislative changes which give a special status to metropolitan areas, income sources and specific powers...|$|R
40|$|Recent European housing {{policies}} have been focussing on the attractiveness of cities and their growth potential. In accordance with the European social model, homes are considered a primary asset and a fundamental right, {{as well as a}} basic component of human dignity. On the basis of this more general approach to the housing issue, new draft laws have been proposed within the European cohesion policy 2014 - 2020 regarding: partnership contracts; the place-based approach and the possibility of local authorities to enable community-led local development and <b>integrated</b> <b>territorial</b> <b>investments</b> at subregional level, financed by a combination of funds. It is therefore likely that in future years there might be cooperation between cities and housing organisations for the construction of affordable dwellings, as well as new forms of cooperation with enterprises in terms of innovation (CECODHAS Housing Europe, 2011). The innovation theme is linked to some facts from which two are particularly evident: 1 - the upturn of the value component related to the immaterial aspects of products; 2 - the role of open innovation, more specifically the possibility to progress by creating extensive networks of collaboration. This contribution uncovers the results of an investigation carried out by a research group from Politecnico di Milano that since more than a decade is working with Mantua’s administration on planning, design and governance processes. This was an endeavour both, theoretical and experimental, examining the innovation dynamics at the level of complex projects meant for strengthening the territorial requalification and growth. Inter alia, this report will also refer the outcomes of a competition for students and young professionals organised by TEMA Laboratory of the Milan Polytechnic-Mantua campus together with Poliespanso Srl, and aimed at promoting new potential uses of the Plastbau technology for the construction of low-cost residential buildings. This action was part {{of a wide range of}} research initiatives sponsored by Regione Lombardia and other institutions within the Province of Mantua in order to respond to the innovation need of the small and medium enterprises in the area.

40|$|Territorial {{approaches}} are a more prominent part of Cohesion {{policy in the}} 2014 - 20 period. Under the evolving urban dimension in European Structural and Investment Funds, the new regulations stipulate a ring-fenced budget of five percent of expenditure for Integrated Sustainable Urban Development (ISUD). New tools to implement territorial approaches have been introduced, including <b>Integrated</b> <b>Territorial</b> <b>Investment</b> (ITI) and Community-led Local Development (CLLD). These tools can be applied in urban areas but also in other territories. The manner in which territorial {{approaches are}} programmed, funded, thematically focussed and implemented differs greatly across IQ-Net countries/regions: •ISUD. In countries/regions where ISUD is implemented through a Priority axis, spending allocations range from close to five percent to almost 20 percent. Some programmes are solely focusing on large metropolitan centres, while others are also concentrating on smaller regional centres. Thematically, ISUD tends to focus on environmental protection and social inclusion. The governance arrangements require a significant level of delegation to the local level, but not all countries use Intermediate Bodies to achieve this. •ITIs. These are used to implement ISUD but can also target other forms of territorial development. In some countries/regions, ITIs {{are expected to be}} a major delivery instrument. Geographically, ITIs tend to focus on urban areas but can also target sub-regional areas, interregional areas or regions with specific territorial features. ITIs are programmed to cover innovation and competitiveness, low carbon economy and renewables and social cohesion themes. Selecting ITIs either happens through pre-selection (based on indicators or a political process) or competitive selection. Local bodies will be significantly involved in the implementation of the strategies, taking on responsibilities concerning the development of strategies, animation and project generation, selection or pre-selection of project activities. •CLLD. Funding allocations for CLLD will vary significantly across Member States and regions. Some use CLLD in a large range of geographical areas, including urban and peri-urban areas. Most Member States will implement CLLD across multiple OPs, contributing to a range of thematic goals. Most CLLD management approaches retain programme Managing Authorities (MAs) in a management role. CLLD can also be used on a cross-border basis. The approach for 2014 - 20 is an extension of existing methods and fits within emerging domestic policy frameworks. Many authorities at Member State level recognise the value of, and show enthusiasm for, integrated territorial approaches and some consider them innovative and inspiring. Potential benefits include increased efficiency and more local power/influence in decision-making. However, MAs have the difficult task of having to establish structures and implementation mechanisms that satisfy local actors’ expectations but also adhere to regulatory requirements. Other challenges include local capacity issues in relation to implementing territorial approaches and questions concerning how thematic concentration and results-orientation align with ring-fenced territorial approaches. Finally, due to the variety of ways in which territorial approaches can be implemented, the provision of guidance has been challenging. A workgroup, Territorial Cohesion and Urban Matters (TCUM), has been established to support implementation of the territorial and urban aspects of the regulations governing the European Structural and Investment Funds. In relation to ITIs, the drafting of scenarios should provide clarification and be a source of inspiration...|$|E
40|$|This {{collection}} of proceedings {{is divided into}} three parts. First one gives examples on the strategic approach to regional development. First chapter, presented by Agnieszka Dembicka-Niemiec is attempt to outline the impact of sustainable development approach to urban policy. It is followed by the contribution of Andrea Miškovičová, who presented some Slovakian experience on the implementation of a creative city strategy. Last work, by Olga Janiszewska and Katarzyna Wiśniewska, is a comparative analysis of development strategies of the city of Lublin and Lubelskie regions, searching for the cohesion between these documents. Second part of the book is the presentation of some specific and practical solutions in the field of urban development policy and regional policy. Here, Edyta Szafranek presents the <b>integrated</b> <b>territorial</b> <b>investments</b> as a tool for implementing the regional policy in the spirit of place based approach. Second chapter of this part provides a Reader with a case study of implementing more and more popular tool of for engaging local communities, which is a participatory budgeting. An example used here by Barbara Skórzak and Piotr Salata-Kochanowski comes from Lodz – a third-largest city in Poland, which is the pioneer of this approach in Central Europe. The last of tools presented here comes from the work of Agnieszka Pietrasik, who presented a model of integrated water resources management in the city of Łódź. It can be concluded that this is a tangible example of the application of sustainable development approach to city ecosystems’ design. Last part of the monograph is devoted to the most universal trends, that can be perceived as a “global framework” for local and regional development policies. Here, a contribution of Iryna Skavronska shows {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} using sports mega-events as a tool of regional and urban transformation, while last chapter, prepared by Lesya Kolinets, outlines the impact of global financial crisis: impact on Central and Eastern Europe. Despite over 40 years of European Cohesion Policy experience, it is still evolving to meet the changes of the socio-economical situation. During the recent years, there is more and more common belief that what can decide about the power of the European Union, it is a variability of institutional contexts of regional development. It means that both studies on local and regional aspects of socio-economic development, as well as relevant policy tools in this matter, should consider on larger and larger scale, so called place-based approach to regional policy. The latter refers to the necessity of capturing “territorial” diversity of European space on different scales of policy intervention. Regional scientists gathered in the European Regional Science Association – Polish Section decided to verify, how this modern paradigm of regional policy is perceived by students and young scientists living in Central European countries. For this purpose, a seminar for Polish, Ukrainian and Slovakian participants has been organized. What was particularly interesting in this context, it was both the perception of the advantage of being a member of European community for these countries who joined UE at the beginning of 21 st century, and the expectations of young Ukrainians, whose country is nowadays on a serious political crossroad, from the EU. This monograph is a material effect of a reunion of Polish, Slovakian and Ukrainian students and young scientists, for whom the European Regional Science Association – Polish Section created a forum for strengthening cross-border cooperation, exchange of experience and development of skills and competencies in the field of regional policy and regional economy, broadly defined...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Over {{the past}} decade, {{the concept of}} {{sustainable}} development has gained increasing importance within China’s urban develop- ment.

The analysis focuses {{on the case of}} the Lihu Lake basin, located in the city of Wuxi (Jiangsu Province), considered by many observers to be at the forefront in China’s quest for sustai- nable urban development.

40|$|A {{huge number}} of {{geographical}} and economic theories and applied researches’ experiences inspire the adopting of common (semi-standardised) processes for sustaining long term territorial development (employment, inclusion, GPD growth). It appears like a urgent European Union {{need in order to}} stabilise appropriate <b>territorial</b> <b>integrated</b> strategic <b>investments</b> overcoming shock and sectorial measures of austerity (Junker plan). At the same time, it seems the unique solution for having to react to a pseudo global financial and economic war (geoeconomic and geopolitical play at no summa zero), focusing resources to maintaining the status quo. Starting from a critical review of literature positions, the paper discusses what modelling the European policy action should follow in order to not invalidate the efforts implemented by austerity measures. Multilevel experiences (benchmarking at different geographical scales) from several 2013 programs (mainly ESPON, URBACT, ENPICiBMED) are resumed to demonstrate this thesis. In order to assess and to measure this aim, territorial cohesive capability is considerate the main vehicle for transforming European challenges in common geopolitical goals. So the paper considers the Europe 2020 pillars and flags as a first turning point {{to be related to the}} territorial regional capability of transforming its diversity in cohesive and competitive development. Some words will be spent about the real compliance between Structural Funds objectives, declared priorities of <b>investment,</b> <b>territorial</b> regional capability, including complex and multidisciplinary variables as cohesion, sustainability and subsidiarity confidence in this evaluation. Example of place evidence and economic-social trends from countries, regions and cities are mentioned and compared for fixing the distance among symbolic expected priorities and real potentials at the short time. At this scope the 2020 political addresses by government declarations and obligations, the regional potential attractive capital, the city potential public and private investments are illustrate with particular regard to the Italy position in the Southern of Europe future. The dissertation in the whole pays particular attention to relate the significant of European territorial evidence with the European policy and funds (e. g. the programming for internal areas distinguished respect to the inner areas ones). This permits to better clarify the different impacts and effects produced from European addresses when the national/regional interpretation does not take in account the relationship between territorial evidence and programming obligations that should increase employment and income. Finally, a set of feasible recommendations are launched on the short time providing viable, flexible, proper, effective and resilient answers to existing needs of <b>territorial</b> <b>investments.</b> These are due because expectations of citizens in front of the current period of economic stagnation. The strategic investment, in principle, should help territories (mainly cities) in having major perspective to realise a territorial regeneration accessing to mainstreaming financing linked to the new Structural Funds, which define the perspective horizon of long term European challenges. They imply joint capitalization, which means not just a(nother) prêt-a-portrait concept, and triggers a multifaceted approach ("quick & dirty" ideas / solutions). Drawbacks so far relate to fragmented territorial intelligence and the need for a certain critical mass willing to get involved. We mean the creating models for strategic integrated sustainable planning by addressing the efficiency of technology across various sectors (energy, climate change, public services, accessibility and transport, etc.) in different typologies and dimension of territory.
