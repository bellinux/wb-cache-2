Comment: With the adoption of the traceability and labelling regulation within the EU it is likely that in due course such regulations will be extended to trade with third countries.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to detect, identify, and {{quantify}} genetically modified (GM) crops by DNA analyses in feed used for animal feeding in Poland. This approach was based on PCR and Real Time PCR techniques and was applied to official <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>feed</b> control in the National Veterinary Research Institute in Pulawy. Within six years studies (2004 - 2009) in 231 (66 %) samples, out of 350 samples of compound feed and feed materials, genetically modified soybean, maize or rapeseed were found. The highest GMO content was found in soybean meal samples and compound feed which consisted of soybean meal. Among 135 analyzed soybean meal samples in 127 (94 %) of them GM soya GTS 40 - 3 - 2 was present. As regards compound feed samples, GM soya was identified in 93 (83 %) samples out of all 112 samples. The presence of GM maize was rare. Only in 11 (11 %) samples, out of all 98 samples of maize, GM maize varieties were found (10 x MON 810, 2 x Bt 11, 2 x T 25). Moreover analyses of 112 compound feed samples indicated that, 16 of them contained Mon 810, 4 samples Bt 11 and 3 samples T 25 GM maize varieties. As regards rapeseed analysis in 5 checked rapeseed samples there were no GM varieties. Another study focused only on GM rapeseed, provided for us independently by official feed control, proved previous results. Out of 100 samples only in 2 of them LibertylinkTM rape was present in the amount below limit of quantification (LOQ) of our method.

40|$|The Danish poultry {{industry}} {{shifted to the}} use of feed derived from genetically-modified (GM) soybeans in February 2014, causing the potential for CO 2 emissions from land-use change in Argentina and Brazil to meet the demand. This problem is investigated within a framework of “hybrid geography” and actor-network theory, allowing for a mixed method investigation of the interconnections between both human and nonhumans. These heterogeneous networks are traced out by following the natural, social, economic and political developments which came to influence the Danish {{poultry industry}}’s shift, which is further quantitatively linked to its potential impact on carbon stock levels from the spatial expansion of GM soybeans. The analysis focuses on the differing lengths of and connections between GM and non-GM soybean networks, and how technologies such as the rendering of meat and bone meal, GM, and agricultural cultivation mobilized change within the social and natural worlds. These technologies were able to facilitate highly interconnected and expansive networks due to their efficiency and economic benefits, but also had unintended side-effects on natural networks, which “kicked back” in the form of BSE, “super weeds” and CO 2 emissions. The outbreak of BSE strengthened the EU’s reliance on soymeal for feed, and lead to EU regulatory change which did not require the labeling of animals fed with <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>feed.</b> As a result, the GM-free “quality” of Danish poultry was not identifiable for consumers. The lack of labeling combined with the comparative inefficiency of cultivation, dwindling supply and extra administrative costs related to non-GM feed reduced the competitiveness of the Danish poultry industry, motivating the shift in feed. Over 115, 000 hectares of land would have to change to facilitate the shifting demand, leading to highly differing CO 2 emissions depending largely on the type of vegetation on the changed land. Lack of precise data limits the conclusiveness, and motivates case-by-case evaluation of future changes in agricultural production and land-use, to account for environmental externalities...|$|E
40|$|The general {{aim of the}} PhD thesis, {{realised}} at the Department of Animal Science and Food Control (University of Napoli, Federico II, Italy), was {{to study}} animal performance and the nutritional characteristics of meat from Buffalo bred in Italy (Italian Mediterranean Buffalo) fed different diets. The importance {{of this research is}} to give a contribute to better characterize the buffalo infra vitam performance (i. e. weight gain, feed conversion index, etc.) and meat quality (mainly in terms of fatty acids profile). Moreover, the originality of the investigation into the field was the diet composition. In particular, in the first experimental study the use of a leguminosae (faba bean, Vicia faba minor L.), as protein source in the diet of buffalo, was compared to the soya bean meal. The second investigation refers the results obtained using a nutraceutical additive (Aloe arborescens) in the dairy cow buffalo diets to study the influence on the colostrums quality and buffalo veal performance in the early period of life. In the first trial it has been demonstrated that feeding growing buffalo with diet without soybean does not affect either in vivo performances (body weight, daily weight gain and biological efficiency of growth, feed conversion index) or nutritional characteristics of meat. This is very interesting, due to the public concerns about <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>feed,</b> as large part of soybean nowadays is. The second trial confirmed the influence of good quality colostrums on the calves growth. Indeed, the addition of Aloe arborescens to the mother’s diet during the last period of pregnancy, significantly increased the immunoglobulin content of colostrums. This result, in addition to determine and adequate passive transfer of immunity, very probably also determined the higher growing performances of calves due to the link of IgG to a number of growth and maturation factors able to increase absorption of nutrients from intestine. Particularly interesting are the results on the fatty acids profile and cholesterol content of buffalo meat. The cholesterol content results lower than those found for the Italian bovine bred specialised for meat production; the contents of myristic, palmitic and stearic acids result significantly lower than those recorded by other authors for young bulls of Chianina bred. To the light of the both high atherogenic and thrombogenic activity of the first two fatty acids and of that only thrombogenic of the stearic acid, we can attribute a favourable judgment to buffalo meat from the dietetic-nutritional point of view. In fact, although the contents of oleic acid and of PUFA of the ω- 6 and ω- 3 series are not particularly high, both the atherogenicity (AI) and the thrombogenicity (TI) index were very low...|$|E

This report describes some of the current possibilities and limitations regarding analysis of GM contents in seed and feed. Analysis for GMO contents in seed and feed is demanded by, e. g., the existence of labelling regulations, the need to control the presence of non-approved GMOs, and the need to monitor the effectiveness of regulations on co-existence of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified,</b> conventional and organic crops. A central issue is the possibilities - or maybe rather the lacking possibilities - for making precise measurements of low GMO contents. This is a problem of special importance when low thresholds for labelling of GMO content are established in various pieces of legislation. In a special section the results of a small GMO ring analysis of soybean, maize and oilseed rape samples are presented. The final part of the report contains an overview of the current GMO analysis situation regarding seed and feed in the individual Nordic countries. In addition, results of GMO controls in the respective countries from the period 2001 - 2003 are presented here...|$|R
40|$|Quality {{assurance}} is {{a prerequisite}} for accurate and reliable results in food and feed testing, ISO/IEC 17025 being recognized worldwide as the base standard. A flexible scope of accreditation enables testing laboratories to react quickly to customer demand and to cope with the large number of new methods, which have to be introduced in the laboratory. Precisely defined procedures for the validation of methods, together with performance and acceptance criteria, are the key points for flexible scope of accreditation. Testing for <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> organisms (GMO) is a challenging exercise, especially with more GMOs entering the world market. We describe here the organization and performance of validating quantitative detection methods for GMO testing {{in the context of the}} EU legislation. Operational procedures for method validation organized by the Community Reference Laboratory for <b>Genetically</b> <b>Modified</b> Food and <b>Feed</b> (CRL-GMFF), assisted by the European Network of GMO Laboratories (ENGL) are described. A protocol for validating methods within an individual laboratory is proposed and discussed in terms of the requirements of flexible scope of accreditation. The system setup can be an example for other similar fields of analytical work. JRC. I. 6 -Biotechnology and GMO...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the frame}} of the EU-funded MARLON project, {{background}} data were reviewed to explore the possibility of measuring health indicators during post-market monitoring for potential effects of <b>feeds,</b> particularly <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> (GM) <b>feeds,</b> on livestock animal health, if applicable. Four case studies (CSs) of potential health effects on livestock were framed and the current knowledge of a possible effect of GM feed was reviewed. Concerning allergenicity (CS- 1), there are no case-reports of allergic reactions or immunotoxic effects resulting from GM feed consumption as compared with non-GM feed. The likelihood of horizontal gene transfer (HGT; CS- 2) of GMO-related DNA to different species is not different from that for other DNA and is unlikely to raise health concerns. Concerning mycotoxins (CS- 3), insect-resistant GM maize may reduce fumonisins contamination as a health benefit, yet other Fusarium toxins and aflatoxins show inconclusive results. For nutritionally altered crops (CS- 4), the genetic modifications applied lead to compositional changes which require special considerations of their nutritional impacts. No health indicators were thus identified except for possible beneficial impacts of reduced mycotoxins and nutritional enhancement. More generally, veterinary health data should ideally be linked with animal exposure information so as to be able to establish cause-effect relationships...|$|R
