25|$|According to folklore, notably {{celebrated by}} a statue {{in front of}} the town hall, the city got its name from a legend about a giant called Antigoon who lived near the Scheldt river. He exacted a toll from passing boatmen, and for those who refused, he severed one of their hands and threw it into the river. Eventually the giant was killed by a young hero named Silvius Brabo, who cut off the giant's own hand and <b>flung</b> <b>it</b> into the river. Hence the name Antwerpen, from Dutch hand werpen, akin to Old English hand and wearpan (to throw), which has evolved to today's warp.|$|E
2500|$|Before making The Shining, Stanley Kubrick had {{directed}} the 1975 movie Barry Lyndon, a highly visual period film about an Irish man who {{attempts to make}} his way into the British aristocracy. Despite its technical achievements, the film was not a box office success in the United States and was derided by critics for being too long and too slow. Kubrick, disappointed with Barry Lyndons lack of success, realized he needed to make a film that would be commercially viable as well as artistically fulfilling. Stephen King was told [...] that Kubrick had his staff bring him stacks of horror books as he planted [...] himself in his office to read them all: [...] "Kubrick's secretary heard the sound of each book hitting the wall as the director <b>flung</b> <b>it</b> into a reject pile after reading the first few pages. Finally one day the secretary noticed it had been a while since she had heard the thud of another writer's work biting the dust. She walked in to check on her boss and found Kubrick deeply engrossed in reading The Shining." ...|$|E

60|$|They {{picked up}} his body from the {{tessellated}} floor of the loggia, carried it to the parapet as Andreas's had been carried, and <b>flung</b> <b>it</b> down into the Abbot's garden as Andreas's had been <b>flung.</b> <b>It</b> lay in a rosebush, dyeing the Abbot's roses a deeper red.|$|E

60|$|Brooks {{crumpled}} {{the letter}} up and <b>flung</b> <b>it</b> into the waste-paper basket.|$|E
60|$|Yet Blood did not {{immediately}} answer. His mind was heaving in tumult, and he was striving to calm it that he might take a proper survey of this thing <b>flung</b> into <b>it</b> to create so monstrous a disturbance. He began where another might have ended.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Come hither to-morrow and I {{will answer}} you,' replied Yspaddaden Penkawr, {{and as they}} rose to leave the hall he caught {{up one of the}} three {{poisoned}} darts that lay beside him and <b>flung</b> <b>it</b> in their midst.

60|$|At {{the cottage}} they found Ignacio's horse--a very fine one--with a lasso {{hanging from the}} saddle. Beside it stood a loose horse with the carcass of a guanaco <b>flung</b> over <b>it,</b> and a Gaucho lad who was the hunter's only attendant. Quashy was engaged in {{animated}} conversation with this youth, and Manuela stood beside him listening.|$|R
6000|$|Then, like a pawing horse let go, [...] She made {{a sudden}} bound: [...] <b>It</b> <b>flung</b> the blood into my head, [...] And I {{fell into a}} swound.|$|R
60|$|I do {{not know}} whether it was the {{influence}} of that thing lying {{in a corner of the}} barn under the cloak that Rodenard had <b>flung</b> over <b>it,</b> or whether other influences of destiny were at work to impel me to rise at the end of a half-hour and announce my determination to set out on horseback and find myself quarters more congenial.|$|R

60|$|Bailey thought {{swiftly and}} {{clutched}} a medicine bottle in either hand. One he <b>flung,</b> and <b>it</b> smashed against the acacia. Silently and deliberately, and keeping his bright {{eyes fixed on}} Bailey, the Malay clambered into the balcony. Bailey, still clutching his second bottle, but with a sickening, sinking feeling about his heart, watched first one leg come over the railing and then the other.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, John, I'd turn Gentile," [...] he said, with terrible {{softness}}. It was a softness that scorned Shefford for asking, {{and likewise}} <b>it</b> <b>flung</b> defiance at his creed {{and into the}} face of hell.|$|R

6000|$|... --The soul is born, he said vaguely, {{first in}} those moments I told you of. It has a slow and dark birth, more mysterious than {{the birth of the}} body.

60|$|Above {{this crowd}} of his fellow-creatures, Stephen drove, {{and the same}} Spring wind which had made the elm-trees talk, whispered to him, and tried to tell him of the million flowers it had fertilised, the million leaves uncurled, the million ripples it had awakened on the sea, of the million flying shadows <b>flung</b> by <b>it</b> across the Downs, and how into men's hearts its scent had driven a million longings and sweet pains.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} it a moment, then savagely tore it in pieces and <b>flung</b> <b>it</b> in the fire.|$|E

6000|$|... “Here!” said Mr Verloc, {{giving a}} slight kick to the gladstone {{bag on the}} floor; and Stevie <b>flung</b> himself upon <b>it,</b> seized it, bore it off with triumphant devotion. He was so prompt that Mr Verloc was {{distinctly}} surprised.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{threw my}} whole weight against my bedroom {{door in the}} hope of forcing the lock. It stood firm for a while, but I <b>flung</b> myself upon <b>it</b> again and again, until {{something}} snapped and I found myself in the passage.|$|R
