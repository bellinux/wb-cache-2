The role of pre-engineering curricula in STEM education is examined, and the various curricula that are being used in technology education classrooms since the publication of the Standards <b>for</b> <b>Technological</b> <b>Literacy</b> are also traced.

A team of teachers, 9 th-grade students, media specialists, and a researcher implemented a technological and information skills model across subject -area disciplines {{in an effort to}} identify the needed skills and implement an instructional program <b>for</b> <b>technological</b> <b>literacy.</b> The researcher worked with a formative and summative committee to design and produce a conceptual design, scope, sequence, and instructional schedule that served four grade levels across subject area curricula. Teachers used an interdisciplinary approach to instruction and determined that effective and efficient teaching <b>for</b> <b>technological</b> <b>literacy</b> across the curriculum was achieved. Students successfully demonstrated performance in 14 core competencies over a two-month time period during regular courses in five major disciplines. During the study, students benefited from opportunities to engage in supplemental technological activities by individual choice. Performance of technological objectives was marked and entered on checklists for planned future entry into a networked database for use by all teachers and administrators. Individual checklists were printed and became a part of student portfolios displaying technological learning. Other items in the portfolios included self-entry and exit-analyses and pre- and post-instruction compositions. Assessment instruments developed for the study were used to evaluate teacher attitudes, portfolio development, student attitudes, and class performance. Teachers and technology committee members judged the program to be successful and projected a need for implementation of the program for the entire school population. Findings and recommendations showed that cross-discipline instruction based on the model used in the study was a solution for increasing student levels literacy through increased understandings and demonstrated performance. The study revealed a need for further research in areas of curriculum space, cooperative work, and contextual problem-solving education as they apply to improving technological literacy in secondary schools...|$|E

40|$|The {{first part}} of this thesis {{contains}} a theoretical description of the importance of technology and <b>technological</b> <b>literacy.</b> It introduces the dimensions and standards of <b>technological</b> <b>literacy</b> <b>for</b> pupils aged 9 to 12, followed by a comparative analysis of the Slovenian curriculums of technical subjects (natural science, technical studies, engineering and technology). The thesis has two goals. The first is to evaluate the <b>technological</b> <b>literacy</b> rates among students in the 5 th and 6 th grade of elementary school. For this purpose, the current evaluation method was expanded (S. Avsec, 2010) and the test battery, pilot test and final test were prepared. The final test was then used at four elementary schools to measure a <b>technological</b> <b>literacy</b> rate of 35. 7 %. Statistically significant differences between grades and genders were sought using a t-test. The effect size was determined with a Cohen's d. In terms of the difference between the 5 th and 6 th grade, the effect was low to moderate <b>for</b> »overall <b>technological</b> literacy«, and moderate for »critical thinking« and »decision-making« components of <b>technological</b> <b>literacy.</b> In terms of gender, statistically significant differences can be observed only for »critical thinking« and »decision-making« components where the effect is weak to moderate. The second goal of this thesis was to find correlations between the attitude towards technical science (using the Tehnika in jaz questionnaire which is a reconstruction of Pupil's Attitude Towards Technology (PATT) instruments) and technology, and the <b>technological</b> <b>literacy</b> rate measured in the first part using a multiple regression analysis. Several correlations were observed. The strongest positive correlation (β = 0. 22) was observed between the desire to study/work in technical sciences/engineering and the »critical thinking« and »decision-making« components, while the strongest negative correlation (β = - 0. 17) was between the pupils' interest in engineering and technology and technological knowledge...|$|R

Chapter One presents a problem statement and a literature review, including summaries of early discussions of collaboration and pedagogy in Composition Studies, studies of collaboration within Professional Writing, and definitions of <b>technological</b> <b>literacy.</b> Chapter Two presents my methodology: qualitative case studies using a postcritical, feminist, Christian approach. It details my methodological goals and their roots in my readings of postcritical and feminist theories and in my Biblical worldview. Chapter Three profiles the <b>technological</b> <b>literacy</b> of each of the eight participants, examining in five areas: history, functional literacy, habits and perceived skills, attitudes and values, and changes in <b>technological</b> <b>literacy.</b> Chapter Four details each team’s collaborative process, interrogating <b>technological</b> <b>literacies</b> in action and complicated by the additional factor of collaboration. Throughout Chapter Four, I weave a number of threads, such as mode of collaboration, effects of physical space, relevant “disconnects,” and influence of gender. Chapter Five discusses the findings detailed in the two previous chapters. Relevant findings include: the differences in <b>technological</b> <b>literacy</b> among participants in/from technology-rich environments; the lack of critical <b>technological</b> <b>literacy</b> among the participants and that lack’s influence on the teams’ processes and products; the clash of document management strategies and that clash’s influence on one team’s meeting, writing and revising processes, and relationships; the lack of peer-to-peer teaching on a mixed-gendered team and limited peer-to-peer teaching on an all-female team; the ways in which physical space both enabled and hampered collaboration and the steps certain participants took to overcome the limitations of the physical space; the influence of gender in collaboration.

This has also been the case in Malawi where the curriculum has had a strong focus on skills development. However, lately {{there has been}} a call <b>for</b> enhancing <b>technological</b> <b>literacy</b> of students, yet little support has been provided for teachers to achieve this goal. This paper reports from a wider study that looked at teachers’ existing views and practices in technical education in Malawi. The article focuses on the findings from interviews that were conducted with six secondary school teachers to find out about their understanding of the meaning and rationale for technical education. It is also discussed how the teachers view technical education as involving skills development for making things and their thoughts on the benefits of such knowledge. It is argued that teachers’ views about technical education were strongly linked to the goals of the curriculum vacationalization policies adopted at the dawn of political independence. Besides skills training they saw the potential to impart thinking skills related to design and problem solving, and the need for essential pedagogical techniques to support learning in technical education. Examination requirements, inadequate opportunities to conduct practical activities and a lack of supportive policy were seen as limiting factors. This article claims that teachers’ views were shaped by their expectations and beliefs about the nature of technical education and what they perceived students may gain from such learning. Their views were also influenced by contextual factors which may have implications on reforms towards broader notions of technology education...|$|R
