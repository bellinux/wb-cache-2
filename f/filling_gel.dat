40|$|Oral {{administration}} of pharmaceuticals is a convenient and simple route for drug delivery. Due to challenges concerning patient compliance and bioavailability, {{there has been}} exerted a great effort {{the last couple of}} years to optimize different types of oral delivery vehicles. Gelled emulsion-based systems have shown great promise as delivery system. They are chewable, thereby increasing patient compliance, and they are able to &# 147;trap&# 148; drugs, either in the gelled or dispersed phase, and thus provide a controlled and prolonged release of the drug, which reduce the possibility of the drug being inactivated in the stomach. The purpose of this study was to investigate how gelatin type and strength, as well as oil content, influences the physical properties of gelatin-based solid emulsions. <b>Filled</b> <b>gel</b> emulsions stabilized by 160 g or 260 g Bloom gelatin type A or B were prepared with varying amounts of corn oil (0, 10, 20, 40 and 50 wt. %) and subjected to rheological characterization. The obtained results showed an increase in storage modulus, gelling and melting temperatures and viscosity with increasing amount of dispersed phase. The increases were more pronounced for both 160 g and 260 g gelatin type A, than for either types of gelatin B. Gelled emulsions were investigated using longitudinal deformation and there was a clear increase in Young&# 146;s modulus for gelatin A when the oil content was raised. For 260 g Bloom gelatin A and B, there was also a clear trend towards a decrease in force and strain at break with increasing oil content, but again, this was more pronounced in gelatin type A. In vitro dissolution studies in a near gastric environment were performed on a <b>filled</b> <b>gel</b> emulsion (40 wt. % corn oil) stabilised by either gelatin type A or B (260 g Bloom). Here there was also seen a clear correlation between the rheological characteristics of the <b>filled</b> <b>gel</b> emulsions and dissolution time, where gelatin type A had a prolonged dissolution profile compared to gelatin type B. According to these results, there is a possibility to use different gelatin types and oil content to modify the properties of <b>filled</b> <b>gel</b> emulsions for a variety of pharmaceutical applications. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{lubrication}} behaviour of emulsions, gels, and emulsion-filled gels was studied {{in relation to}} their composition and structure. It was found that emulsions had much lower friction coefficients than their continuous phases. Emulsions with 40 wt% oil had the same friction coefficient as the pure oil. The lubrication properties of the gels, sheared by pressing them through a syringe, strongly depended on the molecular properties of the gelling agent and on the breakdown behaviour of the gel matrix. For each type of emulsion-filled gel, the lubrication behaviour was affected by the interactions between oil droplets and matrix. For gels containing oil droplets bound to the matrix, the friction coefficient gradually decreased with increasing oil concentration. For gels containing oil droplets non-bound to the matrix, the friction coefficient of the <b>filled</b> <b>gels</b> was lower than that of the same gel matrix without oil. However, no effect of the oil concentration on friction was observed. The different effects of the oil concentration on the lubrication behaviour of the various gels were explained by the relation between droplet¿matrix interactions and the `apparent viscosity¿ of the sheared gels. For gels with bound droplets, increasing the oil concentration resulted in an increase of the `apparent viscosity¿ of the sheared gel. For gels with unbound droplets, the oil concentration did not affect the `apparent viscosity¿. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) observations of both emulsions and <b>filled</b> <b>gels</b> did not reveal coalescence of the oil droplets {{as a result of the}} shear treatment inherent to friction measurements...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the impact on the texture properties of emulsion-filled gels when saturated solid fat is replaced by unsaturated liquid oil. Whey protein aggregate, gelatin and micellar casein, were chosen to form different types of gel matrices and the fat hardness was varied by selection of the fat type and variation of the temperature. As emulsifier, either whey protein aggregates, whey protein or sodium caseinate was used. Texture properties of the <b>filled</b> <b>gels</b> were investigated by uniaxial compression. The fracture properties were affected by the presence of emulsion droplets, however the effect of fat hardness was small. The presence of emulsion droplets (either liquid or solid) increases the gel stiffness as compared to the emulsion-free gel, indicating that the droplets are an active part of the gel. An increase in solid fat content led to a moderate increase in gel stiffness for whey protein aggregate gels, which was in agreement with predictions according to the Palierne model for the effect of fat hardness on the stiffness of the <b>filled</b> <b>gels.</b> For the gelatin and micellar casein gels, the magnitude by which the gel stiffness increased {{as a function of the}} solid fat content was much larger than expected on the basis of this model. Microscopical observation suggested that this was caused by an inhomogeneous distribution of the fat droplets, due to droplet aggregation or/and concentration of the droplets in gel strands, which increases the effective volume fraction of the droplets in the matrix...|$|R

Textural properties of the <b>filled</b> <b>gels</b> were investigated by uniaxial compression, while optical properties were investigated by turbidity. The MSPs were characterized with the objective of correlating particle features with their impact on the corresponding filled-gel properties. The addition of MSPs (both with and without functionalization) increased the stiffness of the gelatine gels. Furthermore, functionalized MSPs showed a remarkable increase in the strength of the gels and a slight reduction in the brittleness of the gels, in contrast with nonfunctionalized MSPs which showed no effect on these two properties. The turbidity of the gels was also affected by the addition of all tested MSPs, showing that the particles that formed smaller aggregates resulted in a higher contribution to turbidity. MSPs are promising candidates for the development of functional food containing smart delivery systems, also being able to modulate the functionality of protein gels. © 2014 American Chemical Society...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the effect and magnitude of fat droplet clustering on the rheological properties of emulsion-filled gels. To this end, we investigated experimentally the effect of fat hardness and emulsion droplet clustering in gelatin gels. Fat droplet clustering was induced or avoided by changing the temperature at which the emulsion was mixed with the gelatin. Rheological properties of the <b>filled</b> <b>gels</b> were investigated by uniaxial compression. The obtained experimental data show that next to changes in droplet hardness and matrix hardness, also droplet clustering contributes to the gel stiffness; {{even in the absence of}} discrete bonds between adjacent droplets. The experimental data was compared with the Kerner model, the Kerner model corrected by the effective volume fraction approach and the Kerner model considering an inhomogeneous distribution of the droplets. The Kerner model gives a good prediction for the <b>gels</b> <b>filled</b> with liquid droplets without clustering.

Low-filler (6 % particles), reduced-filler (16 %), and full-filler (33 %) cheeses were produced using either Sephadex beads of varying sizes (20 to 150 μm diameter) or milkfat. Small- and large-strain rheological tests were run on each treatment at 8, 12, and 18 wk after cheese manufacturing. Differences in rheological properties were caused primarily by the main effects of filler volume and type (milkfat vs. Sephadex), whereas filler size had no obvious effect. All treatments showed a decrease in deformability and an increase in firmness as filler volume increased above 25 %, although the beads exhibited a greater reinforcing effect and greater energy recovery than milkfat...|$|R

40|$|In this study, the {{differential}} breakdown of protein gels containing {{four types of}} high and low cross-linked starch granules were studied. Susceptibility to saliva-induced breakdown of starch granules and the consequences of these for overall breakdown of the gel matrix were captured using a multiple extrusion cell (MEC). <b>Gels</b> <b>filled</b> with two types of starch were used for sensorial evaluation by a QDA panel and the mechanical impact of the starch granules on these latter gels was characterized using uniaxial compression measurements. These data were used to better understand differences in sensory mouth feel attributes. MEC measurements indicated that the low cross-linked starches were more susceptible to saliva-induced breakdown compared to their highly cross-linked counterparts. The sensory space of starch <b>filled</b> <b>gels</b> was divided into three dimensions. Protein content of the gel matrix determined one dimension, resulting in high sensory ratings for separating and slippery mouth feel. The distinction into the two other dimensions, one being dominated by grainy/spreadable/sticky and the other by crumbly/crumbly effort, originates mainly from different starch types used: larger starch granules from the low cross-linked potato starch were perceived as more grainy and <b>gels</b> <b>filled</b> with these granules were more spreadable with a lower rating for crumbly and crumbly effort. Surprisingly, in most cases ratings for firm for both starch types were more or less comparable, indicating that these granules behave as inert fillers in a rather similar way, as also suggested by compression measurements. This work indicates that low cross-linked potato starch displays a higher susceptibility for digestion by amylase present in saliva. This is possibly the reason for the larger spreadability and lower rating for crumbly effort of the gel containing this type of starch. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Comparative {{investigations}} are reported on poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPA) gels of various carbon nanotube (CNT) and graphene oxide (GO) contents synthesized under identical conditions. The kind and {{concentration of the}} incorporated carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) influence the swelling and stress-strain behaviour of the composites. Practically independently of the filler content, incorporation of CNPs appreciably improves the fracture stress properties of the gels. The time constant and the swelling ratio of the shrinkage following an abrupt increase in temperature of the swelling medium from 20 to 50 °C can be adjusted by selecting both the type {{and the amount of}} nanoparticle loading. This offers a means of accurately controlling the deswelling kinetics of drug release with PNIPA systems, and could be employed in sensor applications where fast and excessive shrinkage are a significant drawback. Both CNTs and GO enhance the infrared sensitivity of the PNIPA gel, thus opening a route for the design of novel drug transport and actuator systems. It is proposed that the influence of the CNPs depends more on their surface reactivity during the gel synthesis rather than on their morphology.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} the effect and magnitude of matrix inhomogeneity on the rheological properties of emulsion-filled gels. To this end, we have investigated the rheological properties in casein gels containing different volume fractions of dispersed fat droplets with varying hardness. Rheological properties of the <b>filled</b> <b>gels</b> were investigated by uniaxial compression. Matrix inhomogeneity was controlled by changing the casein concentration, and was quantified by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and image analysis. CLSM images showed that the matrix becomes more inhomogeneous when the protein concentration decreases and image analysis was used to quantify this inhomogeneity. As the dispersed fat droplets bind to the proteins (active droplets), the droplets are located more in the casein-rich areas. The inhomogeneous distribution of the casein micelles led to an accumulation of the dispersed fat droplets in the gelled micellar casein regions, thereby increasing the effective volume fraction of the droplets. This increase in the effective volume fraction of the droplets was higher for lower casein concentrations, due to a higher degree of inhomogeneity, resulting in a larger effect in reinforcing the gel compared to more homogeneous systems. These results may be used for designing structures to decrease the fat content or replace solid fat by liquid oil...|$|R

For emulsions stabilized with native WPI, creaming was observed upon mixing of the emulsion with a suspension of WPI aggregates, likely {{as a result of}} depletion flocculation induced by the differences in size between the droplets and aggregates. For emulsions stabilized with soluble WPI aggregates, the obtained filled suspension was stable against creaming, and homogeneous emulsion-filled gels with varying protein and oil concentrations were obtained. Large deformation properties of the emulsion-filled cold-set WPI gels were determined by uniaxial compression. With increasing oil concentration, the fracture stress increases slightly, whereas the fracture strain decreases slightly. Small deformation properties were determined by oscillatory rheology. The storage modulus after 16 h of acidification was taken as a measure of the gel stiffness. Experimental results were in good agreement with predictions according to van der Poel's theory for the effect of oil concentration on the stiffness of <b>filled</b> <b>gels.</b> Especially, the influence of the modulus of the matrix on the effect of the oil droplets was in good agreement with van der Poel's theory...|$|R

Furthermore, gel formation started at a lower temperature with increasing oil volume fraction. The increase in the moduli with increasing volume fraction of oil droplets was stronger than predicted by Van der Poels theory for a simple <b>filled</b> <b>gel</b> containing single interacting stiff emulsion droplets.

40|$|Key words: polymer gels, {{particle}} gels, emulsion, large deformation, friction, sensory   This thesis reports {{studies on}} the large deformation and lubrication properties of emulsion-filled gels and the way these properties {{are related to the}} sensory perception of the gels. The design of the studies included polymer and particle gels containing oil droplets of which the interaction with the gel matrix was varied, resulting in droplets either bound or unbound to the matrix. The unique combination of gel matrices and droplet-matrix interactions allowed to obtain a representative overview of the effect of the oil droplets on the properties studied. The molecular properties of the gel matrices determined the way the large deformation properties of the gels depended on the deformation speed. Polymer gels showed a predominantly elastic behaviour. Particle gels showed a more viscoelastic behavior. The effect of the oil content on the Young’s modulus of the gels was modulated by the droplet-matrix interactions, in agreement with existing theories. Bound droplets increased the Young’s modulus of the <b>filled</b> <b>gels,</b> whereas unbound droplets decreased it. Oil droplets embedded in the gel matrix acted as stress concentration nuclei. They also increased energy dissipation due to friction between structural elements of the gel (oil droplets and gel matrix). Stress concentration resulted in a decrease of the fracture strain for all gels and in a decrease of the fracture stress for polymer gels. For gels with non-aggregated bound droplets, a reduction in oil droplet size had the same effect on their rheological properties as an increase in oil volume fraction. The lubrication properties of the gels strongly depended on both the molecular and functional properties of the gel matrix and the oil content. For each type of gel matrix, the lubrication behaviour was affected by the ‘apparent viscosity’ of the broken gels, which in turn depended on the droplet-matrix interactions. The sensory perception of emulsion-filled gels appeared to be dominated by the properties of the gel matrix and by the oil content. Polymer gels were perceived as more melting, whereas particle gels were perceived as more rough. With increasing oil content both types of gels became more creamy and spreadable. The increase in spreadability and part of the increase in creaminess could be explained with the effect of the oil droplets on the breakdown properties of the gels. Since for all gels the scores for creaminess increased with increasing oil content, the release of oil droplets during oral processing could not completely explain the perception of oil-related sensory attributes. It is therefore concluded that the perception of these attributes is mediated by the lubrication properties of the broken gel. The large deformation and lubrication behaviour of the gels were the most important parameters related to sensory perception. Both parameters were affected by the droplet-matrix interaction. As a matter of fact, the droplet-matrix interaction affected the fracture behaviour of the <b>filled</b> <b>gels,</b> which was related to their spreadability, and the ‘apparent viscosity’ of the broken gels, which controlled the lubrication properties of these systems...|$|R

The QDA results revealed that the variation of mechanical properties led to significant differences in texture properties perceived at first bite (firmness and brittleness). Texture attributes perceived at later stages of mastication showed significant differences between gels depending on the first bite properties e. g. soft gels were perceived as more melting. Progressive profiling showed that creaminess increased over eating time while firmness decreased. TDS results were in agreement with the other methods and additionally conveyed information on the succession of perceived attributes over time. The TDS sensory trajectories demonstrated that for all gels dynamic perception evolved in a similar fashion but samples with a high or low fracture strain differed at the end of oral processing. We conclude that texture {{perception of}} semi-solid gels is dynamic and can be measured by either of the three sensory methods.
