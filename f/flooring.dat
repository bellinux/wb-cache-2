5|$|European {{visitors}} in 1667 reported the Sihanaka lived in fortified villages, which they very effectively defended with bows and arrows.

Gendered roles factored into house construction and maintenance: men applied carpentry to build {{the frame of the}} house and roof, as well as the windows and doors and their frames, while women wove zozoro reed mats that would serve as walls, <b>flooring</b> and roofing.|$|E

5|$|In {{its native}} range, the {{sycamore}} {{is associated with}} a biodiverse range of invertebrates and fungi, but these are not always present in areas to which it has been introduced. It is sometimes planted in urban areas for its value as an amenity tree and produces a hard-wearing, creamy-white close-grained timber that is used for making musical instruments, furniture, joinery, wood <b>flooring</b> and kitchen utensils. It also makes good firewood. The rising sap in spring has been used to extract sugar and make alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks, and honey is made by bees collecting the nectar.|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} the aim {{to make use of}} {{renewable}} resources, the furniture in Poh Ern Shih for its resident monastics is made from bamboo.

500|$|E.Due {{to common}} {{practice}} of [...] skipping <b>floors</b> {{with the number}} 4 (e.g. 4, 14, 24, 34, ... and so on) and 13 in Hong Kong, <b>floors</b> may not be labelled sequentially. Thus a building's total count of actual <b>floors</b> may not be equal {{to the number of}} the top <b>floor.</b> As an example, one residential tower has a top <b>floor</b> labelled [...] "88", but contains only 42 actual <b>floors.</b> Sources that state the number of the top <b>floor</b> for a building's <b>floor</b> count may overstate the actual number of <b>floors</b> for the building in question.
