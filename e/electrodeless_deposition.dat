The electrodes so prepared were characterized with SEM, EDS, XRD, and XPS. Electrochlorination {{was carried out}} using Escherichia coli (E.  coli) as the model microorganism. Results showed that the metal oxides significantly improved the efficiency of chlorine generation. The rate constant of chlorine generation increased in the order: PtNiCo/G > RuNiCo/G > NiCo/G > PdNiCo/G > CuNiCo/G > graphite (G). Pt-, Ni-, and Co-oxides were formed on the PtNiCo/G electrode surface, which contributed to the generation of high chlorine concentration at high current efficiency and low energy consumption. Cyclic votammetry (CV) analysis of the PtNiCo/G electrode showed that the chlorine evolution potential was lower than the oxygen evolution potential. The PtNiCo/G electrode had a high chlorine evolution potential due {{to the presence of}} Co(II) and Co(III) on the electrode surface and the unique morphology that brought about active surface sites. An E.  coli killing efficiency of 5. 2 -log could be achieved over a contact time of around 10  min on the PtNiCo/G electrode in the presence of NaCl at a dilute concentration of 0. 01  M NaCl and a constant current density of 10  mA cm− 2...|$|E
40|$|Surface-enhanced Raman {{scattering}} is {{a powerful}} method used in chemoand biosensorics. The aim of this work {{was to determine the}} relationship between the signal of Surface-enhanced Raman scattering and the shape of silver nanostructures under the influence of laser radiation with different power. Plasmonic nanostructures were synthesized in silicon dioxide pores on monocrystalline silicon n-type substrate. The pores were formed using ion-track technology and selective chemical etching. Silver deposition was carried out by galvanic displacement method. Synthesis time was chosen as a parameter that allows controlling the shape of a silver deposit in the pores of silicon dioxide on the surface of single-crystal n-silicon during <b>electrodeless</b> <b>deposition.</b> Deposition time directly effects on the shape of metal nanostructures. Analysis of the dynamics of changing the morphology of the metal deposit showed that as the deposition time increases, the metal evolves from individual metallic crystallites within the pores at a short deposition time to dendritic-like nanostructures at a long time. The dependence of the intensity of Surface-enhanced Raman scattering spectra on the shape of the silver deposit is studied at the powers of a green laser (λ = 532 nm) from 2. 5 μW to 150 μW on the model dye analyte Rodamin 6 G. The optimum shape of the silver deposit and laser power is analyzed {{from this point of view}} design of active surfaces for Surface-enhanced Raman scattering with nondestructive control of small concentrations of substances. The silver nanostructures obtained in porous template SiO 2 on n-type silicon substrate could be used as plasmon-active surfaces for nondestructive investigations of substances with low concentrations at low laser powers.  </p...|$|E
