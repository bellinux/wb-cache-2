A pyrochlore lattice {{is considered}} {{where the average}} electron number of electrons per site is half–integer, concentrating {{on the case of}} exactly half an electron per site. Strong on-site repulsions are assumed, so that all sites are either empty or singly occupied. Where there are in addition strong nearest–neighbour repulsions, a tetrahedron rule comes into effect, as previously suggested for magnetite. We show that in this case, there exist excitations with fractional charge ±e/ 2. These are intimately connected with the high degeneracy of the ground state in the absence of kinetic energy terms. When an additional electron is inserted into the system, it decays into two point like excitations with charge −e/ 2, connected by a Heisenberg spin chain which carries the electron’s spin...|$|R

Momentum exchange with accelerated bodies through gravitons is discussed and shown similar to mode exchange in optical fibers. Reported anomalies on the behaviour of the Foucault pendulum, both periodic and exceptional on the occasion of solar eclipses, are explained not only qualitatively but also on order of magnitude, resorting to graviton exchanges between Earth and the Sun or the Moon.

Using {{the density}} matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we study the quantum coherence in one-dimensional disordered Fermi systems. We consider in detail spinless fermions on a ring, {{and compare the}} influence of several kinds of impurities in a gapless and a dimerized, gapped system. In the translation-invariant system a so-called site-impurity, which can be realized by a local potential or a change of one link, increases for repulsive interaction and decreases for attractive interaction. The weakening of two neighboring bonds, which is a realization of a so-called bond-impurity, on the other hand, is healed for repulsive interaction, but enhanced for intermediate attractive interactions. This leads to strong suppression of the quantum coherence measured by the phase sensitivity, but not to localization. Adding a local distortion to a dimerized system we find that even {{the presence of a}} single site-impurity increases the metallic region found in the dimerized model. For a strong dimerization and a high barrier, an additional sharp maximum, even seen for systems with about 100 sites, occurs in the phase sensitivity. A bond-impurity in the dimerized system also opens a small metallic window in the otherwise isolating regime...|$|R

We {{review the}} density of states and related quantities of quasi one-dimensional disordered Peierls systems in which fluctuation effects of a backscattering potential play a crucial role. The low-energy behavior of non-interacting fermions which are subject to a static random backscattering potential will be described by the fluctuating gap model (FGM). Recently, the FGM has also been used to explain the pseudogap phenomenon in high-Tc superconductors. After an elementary introduction to the FGM {{in the context of}} commensurate and incommensurate Peierls chains, we develop a non-perturbative method which allows for a simultaneous calculation of {{the density of}} states (DOS) and the inverse localization length. First, we recover all known results in the limits of zero and infinite correlation lengths of the random potential. Then, we attack the problem of finite correlation lengths. While a complex order parameter, which describes incommensurate Peierls chains, leads to a suppression of the DOS, i. e. a pseudogap, the DOS exhibits a singularity at the Fermi energy if the order parameter is real and therefore refers to a commensurate system. We confirm these results by calculating the DOS and the inverse localization length for finit...|$|R

The {{starting point}} of this work is the principle that all movement of particles and photons in the observable Universe must follow geodesics of a 4 -dimensional space where time intervals are always a measure of geodesic arc lengths, i. e. c 2 (dt) 2 = gαβdx α dx β, with c is {{the speed of light}} in vacuum, t time, gαβ and the metric tensor; x α represents any of 4 space coordinates. The last 3 coordinates (α = 1, 2, 3) are immediately associated with the usual physical space coordinates, while the first coordinate (α = 0) is later found to be related to proper time. The work shows that this principle is applicable in several important situations and suggests that the underlying principle can, in fact, be used universally. Starting with special relativity it is shown that there is perfect mapping between the geodesics on Minkowski space-time and on this alternative space. The discussion than follows through light propagation in a refractive medium, and some cases of gravitation, including Schwartzschild’s outer metric. The last part of the presentation is dedicated to electromagnetic interaction and Maxwell’s equations, showing that there is a particular solution where one of the space dimensions is eliminated and the geodesics become equivalent to light rays in geometrical optics.

We report on simulations of the effect on disk material which reveal that the crossing can sometimes cause local gravitational focussing of disk material. We also present the salient points of a little-known paper by Levy (2000), that shows that strong compression can result from the shock wave generated by GC disk crossing. The main thrust of our paper is a search for remnants of disk crossings by Globular Clusters. Using the gravitational potential of the Galaxy to locate {{the position of the}} most recent crossings of a subset of fifty-four Globular Clusters reveals that systematic errors and uncertainties in initial conditions limit the scope for unequivocal identification. From the subset of fifty-four, six possible search sites with the best constraints are retained for further scrutiny. Three of the six potentially promising search areas in the disk are from Globular Clusters NGC 3201, 6397 and NGC 6838, for which we cannot rule out some observed star associations observed nearby as being remnants. The three other of the six areas are too large to provide meaningful identification of remnants. Also, a possible remnant (open cluster NGC 6231) is shown not to be due to Globular Cluster impact, contrary to a previous report. In a more wide-ranging screening of one hundred and fifty-five Globular Clusters we identify which Globular Clusters are compatible with being responsible for the formation of any of the Galaxy’s five most prominent Star Super Clusters...|$|R

40|$|Setting short yet {{reliable}} Due <b>Dates</b> (<b>DDs)</b> is {{an important}} early production planning and control task. The majority of job-shop research on DD setting assumes simple product structures without assembly operations. However, in practice, product structures are often complex, and multiple final assembly operations may be required. This paper evaluates the performance of DD setting rules {{in the context of}} complex product structures, considering two scenarios: two-level assembly job shops, where orders converge on one final assembly operation; and two-level multi-stage job shops, where a series of assembly operations are undertaken. New rules are proposed which are substantially simpler and more suitable for practical use than those in the literature. These rules are only outperformed by a more sophisticated rule from the wider literature, newly introduced into the context of assembly and multi-stage job shops. Which rule to apply in practice depends on whether a manager considers the improvement in performance more important than the loss of simplicity. Future research should investigate how jobs can be planned and controlled effectively when some or all DDs are set externally by customers rather than internally using a DD setting rule. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Workload control (WLC) is a {{production}} planning and control concept developed {{to meet the}} needs of small- and medium-sized make-to-order companies, where a job shop configuration is common. Although simulation has shown WLC can improve job shop performance, field researchers have encountered significant implementation challenges. One of the most notable challenges is the presence of ‘assembly job shops’ where product structures are more complex than typically modelled in simulation and where the final product consists of several sub-assemblies (or work orders) which have to be co-ordinated. WLC theory has not been developed sufficiently to handle such contexts, and the available literature on assembly job shops is limited. In response, this paper extends the applicability of WLC to assembly job shops by determining the best combination of: (i) WLC due <b>date</b> (<b>DD)</b> setting policy, (ii) release method and (iii) policy for coordinating the progress of work orders. When DDs are predominantly set by the company, the DD setting policy should play the leading role while the role of order release should be limited and the progress of work orders should not be co-ordinated in accordance with the DD of the final product. But when DDs are predominantly specified by customers, the importance of order release as a second workload balancing mechanism increases and work orders should be coordinated by backward scheduling from the DD of the final product. Results indicate that WLC can improve performance in assembly job shops and outperform alternative control policies. Future research should implement these findings in practice...|$|R

The rôle {{of matter}} circulation between the disk and halo {{in establishing the}} volume filling factors of the different ISM phases in the Galactic disk (|z | ≤ 250 pc) is investigated, using {{a modified version of}} the threedimensional supernova-driven ISM model of Avillez (2000). We carried out adaptive mesh refinement simulations of the ISM with five supernova rates (in units of the Galactic value), σ/σGal = 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 (corresponding to starburst conditions) using three finer level resolutions of 2. 5, 1. 25 and 0. 625 pc, allowing us to understand how resolution would affect the volumes of gas phases in pressure equilibrium. We find that the volume filling factors of the different ISM phases depend sensitively on the existence of a duty cycle between the disk and halo acting as a pressure release valve for the hot (T> 10 5. 5 K) phase in the disk. The mean occupation fraction of the hot phase varies from about 17 % for the Galactic SN rate to ∼ 28 %, for σ/σGal = 4, and to 44 % for σ/σGal = 16. The amount of cold gas (defined as the gas with T < 10 3 K) picked up in the simulations varies from a value of 19 % for σ/σGal = 1 to ∼ 5 % for σ/σGal = 4 and ≤ 1 % for higher SN rates. Background heating prevents the cold gas from immediate collapse and thus ensures the stability of the cold gas phase. The warm phase has volume filling factors varying between 0. 25 and 0. 37 for the three lowest SN rates used in the simulations.

METHODS. S. aureus (n 300) strains were tested by OX and FOX DD, MicroScan OX (range 0. 25 – 2. 0 µg/mL) MIC, and Phoenix investigational panels containing OX (0. 25 – 4. 0 µg/mL) and FOX (1. 0 – 64 µg/mL). Testing for mecA gene by real-time PCR was performed on 78 isolates, including all organisms for which any of the 5 phenotypic test results were not in agreement. RESULTS. The results for 20 / 300 (6. 7 %) OX DD were intermediate or resistant and discordant from other phenotypic tests and mecA testing. Initially, the OX MIC category agreement was 294 / 300 between Phoenix and MicroScan.

Methods: The American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Task Group 119 (TG 119) prescribed a protocol to evaluate overall accuracy of IMRT system rather than independent uncertainty in dose calculation, dose delivery and measurement system. Two preliminary and five clinical test cases were created based on dose prescriptions and planning objectives given by TG 119 report. Verification plans were created in a planning slab phantom, 2 D Matrix dosimetry system (I’MatriXX) with multicube phantom and aS- 1000 electronic portal imaging device (EPID). Radiation absorbed doses to high dose points in the planning target volume (PTV) region and low dose points in avoidance structures were measured using CC 13 ionization chamber having sensitive volume of 0. 13 cm 3. The measured and planned doses were normalized with respect to their prescription doses and intercompared. The gamma analysis was carried out for both I’MatriXX and EPID, adopting the acceptance criteria of 3 % DD (dose difference) and 3 mm DTA (distance to agreement) with 10 % threshold dose. Results: For the point dose measurements with ion chamber, the average dose difference ratio in high dose low gradient PTV region was - 0. 0133 ± 0. 012 corresponding to a confidence limit of 0. 037. The average dose difference in low dose region (avoidance structure) was - 0. 00004 ± 0. 010 corresponding to a confidence limit of 0. 021.

We use the reduced-gravity quasi-isopycnal ocean model by Schopf and Loughe (1995) for this study. Two experiments are performed: one with daily and the other with monthly surface forcing. The two experiments are referred to as <b>DD</b> and <b>MM,</b> respectively. The daily surface wind stress is produced from the SSM/I wind data (Atlas et al. 1991) using the drag coefficient of Large and Pond (1982). The surface latent and sensible heat fluxes are estimated using the atmospheric mixed layer model by Seager et al. (1995) with the time-varying air temperature and specific humidity from the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis (Kalnay et al. 1996). The radiation is based on climatological shortwave radiation from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) [Harrison et al. 1993] and the daily GEWEX SRB data. The ocean model domain is restricted to the Pacific Ocean with realistic land boundaries. At the southern boundary the model temperature and salinity are relaxed to the Levitus (1994) climatology. The time-mean SST distribution from MM is close to the observed SST climatology while the mean SST field from DD is about 1. 5 C cooler. To identify the responsible processes, we examined the mean heat budgets and the heat balance during the first year (when the difference developed) in the two experiments. The analysis reveals that this is contributed by two factors. One is the difference in latent heat flux. The other is the difference in mixing processes. To further evaluate the responsible processes, we repeated the DD experiment by reducing the based vertical diffusion from 1 e- 4 to 0. 5 e- 5. The resultant SST field becomes quite closer to the observed SST field. SST variability from the two experiments is generally similar, but the equatorial SST differences between the two experiments show interannual variations. We are investigating the possible mechanisms responsible for the different responses...|$|R
40|$|In vivo {{dosimetry}} {{is one of}} {{the quality}} assurance tools used in radiotherapy to monitor the dose delivered to the patient. Electronic portal imaging device (EPID) images for a set of solid water phantoms of varying thicknesses were acquired and the data fitted onto a quadratic equation, which relates the reduction in photon beam intensity to the attenuation coefficient and material thickness at a reference condition. The quadratic model is used to convert the measured grey scale value into water equivalent path length (EPL) at each pixel for any material imaged by the detector. For any other non-reference conditions, scatter, field size and MU variation effects on the image were corrected by relative measurements using an ionization chamber and an EPID. The 2 D EPL is linked to the percentage exit dose table, for different thicknesses and field sizes, thereby converting the plane pixel values at each point into a 2 D dose map. The off-axis ratio is corrected using envelope and boundary profiles generated from the treatment planning system (TPS). The method requires field size, monitor unit and source-to-surface distance (SSD) as clinical input parameters to predict the exit dose, which is then used to determine the entrance dose. The measured pixel dose maps were compared with calculated doses from TPS for both entrance and exit depth of phantom. The gamma index at 3 % dose difference (<b>DD)</b> and 3 <b>mm</b> distance to agreement (DTA) resulted in an average of 97 % passing for the square fields of 5, 10, 15 and 20 cm. The exit dose EPID dose distributions predicted by the algorithm were in better agreement with TPS-calculated doses than phantom entrance dose distributions...|$|R
