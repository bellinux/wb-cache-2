5|$|At some point, {{possibly}} {{around this}} time, Montagu was killed; {{he was certainly}} dead before his brother. The Arrivall chronicler states this occurred 'in plain battle,' and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> of the fighting, {{rather than in the}} rout that later followed.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} the 8th Battalion, located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> forest of the Bois de Bavant, were under an almost {{constant}} mortar bombardment. Not being directly attacked, the battalion concentrated on night time patrols to harass the Germans, some going {{as far as the}} German occupied villages of Troan and Bures.|$|E
5|$|On Sunday, 31 December, {{fighting}} began <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> mango forests near Helashid, 11 miles (18km) to {{the northwest}} of Jilib. Ethiopian MiG fighters, tanks, artillery and mortars struck Islamic positions in the assault. Residents reported the road to Jilib was littered with remote-controlled landmines by the ICU. TFG and Ethiopian forces also attacked Bulobaley, with mortars and rockets.|$|E
30|$|Comparison of CFRP {{laminates}} with 90 o ply {{of different}} thicknesses (Table 5) {{indicates that the}} laminate with <b>the</b> <b>thicker</b> transverse ply fail at lower stress than the laminate with the thinner transverse ply. Similar behavior can be observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> angle-ply laminates where thinner laminates showed higher stiffness and strength, {{as can be seen}} in Figs.  3 b & c and 4 b & c and Table 5. This is because the Energy Release Rate (ERR) associated with the formation of cracks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thicker</b> laminates is higher, thus caused cracks to form earlier <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thicker</b> laminates.|$|R

5|$|Just {{after midnight}} the New Zealanders sent the 2nd (Wellington West Coast) Squadron, {{commanded}} by Major James McGregor Elmslie, forward {{to reinforce the}} 9th Squadron. But by itself the 2nd Squadron was {{not strong enough to}} break through the Turkish lines and reach the post, and at times they had to engage in close quarter fighting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> scrub.

5|$|The Victor was a futuristic-looking, {{streamlined}} aircraft, {{with four}} turbojet (later turbofan) engines buried <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> wing roots. Distinguishing {{features of the}} Victor were its highly swept T-tail with considerable dihedral on the tail planes, and a prominent chin bulge that contained the targeting radar, cockpit, nose landing gear unit and an auxiliary bomb aimer's position. It was originally required by the specification that the whole nose section could be detached at high altitudes {{to act as an}} escape pod, but the Air Ministry abandoned this demand in 1950.|$|E
40|$|Relaxation of {{strained}} silicon on 20 % linear graded virtual substrates was quantified using high resolution x-ray diffraction and a defect etching technique. The thickness of {{strained silicon}} was varied between 10 and 180 nm. Relaxation was observed <b>in</b> layers below <b>the</b> critical thickness but increased to only 2 % relaxation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thickest</b> layers even with annealings up to 950 °C. Cross-sectional {{transmission electron microscopy}} revealed stacking faults present in layers thicker than 25 nm, and nucleated 90 ° Shockley partial dislocations forming microtwins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thickest</b> layer. These features are implicated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> impediment of the relaxation process...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Tensile {{properties}} of rolled and annealed copper thin foils were investigated {{based on the}} grain size and thickness. Yield strength was higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thinner foil than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thicker</b> foil at as-rolled state. Difference of yield strength between the thinner foil and <b>the</b> <b>thicker</b> foil becomes small at annealed state. Tensile strength was higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thinner foil than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thicker</b> foil at as-rolled state, but it was reversed at annealed state. Strain to fracture or elongation increased with increasing thickness <b>in</b> <b>the</b> annealed state. A knife edge type of fracture was characterized <b>in</b> both <b>the</b> as-rolled state and the annealed state. A higher tensile strength and strain to fracture of <b>the</b> annealed <b>thicker</b> foil was attributed to the higher number of grains per thickness. From this work, {{it was concluded that}} mechanical {{properties of}} thin foils were dependent upon the number of grains per thickness...|$|R

5|$|As the 48th Highlanders secured their {{positions}} west of San Leonardo, the Royal Canadian Regiment {{was involved in}} intense fighting southwest of San Donato. Two companies had advanced against strong and well prepared German defences of the 200th Panzergrenadier Regiment. A Company was quickly tied down by German mortar fire, while B Company flanked German positions {{to the north of}} San Donato. By nightfall, all four companies held tenuous positions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> of German defences. On the night of 8/9 December, the RCR was subjected to counterattacks by the 200th Panzergrenadier Regiment which were repulsed with the support of continuous Canadian artillery shelling.|$|E
5|$|At {{first he}} took soft clay in his bill {{from the edge}} of the water and seemed to be {{smearing}} it on one leg near the knee. Then he fluttered away on one foot for a short distance and seemed to be pulling tiny roots and fibers of grass, which he worked into the clay that he had already smeared on his leg. Again he took some clay and plastered it over the fibers, putting on more and more till I could plainly see the enlargement, working away with strange, silent intentness for fully fifteen minutes, while I watched and wondered, scarce believing my eyes. Then he stood perfectly still for a full hour under an overhanging sod, where the eye could with difficulty find him, his only motion meanwhile being an occasional rubbing and smoothing of the clay bandage with his bill, until it hardened enough to suit him, whereupon he fluttered away from the brook and disappeared <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> woods.|$|E
5|$|By the {{following}} day, Mickl's kampfgruppe was deployed {{on the high}} ground {{on either side of}} the airfield at Sidi Rezegh. That afternoon, British armoured cars and tanks appeared, and Mickl's force was hard-pressed to hold its positions barring the British approach to Tobruk from the south and south-east, as little tank support was available. In the face of a superior force, Mickl's kampfgruppe fought hard in what became known as the Battle of Sidi Rezegh, with their commander often forward rallying his troops, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> of counter-attacks launched to regain ground. Mickl and around 800 of his troops were captured by elements of the New Zealand Division on 26 November 1941, the captured troops being mainly from the Afrika Regiment.|$|E

30|$|Comparison {{of crack}} {{formation}} in laminates of different thicknesses indicates that crack initiation at the coupon edges occur at lower strains in thicker laminates. Both crack propagation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> width direction {{and the rate}} of new crack formation is slower <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thicker</b> laminates, as can be seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> X-Ray images of Figs.  13 and 14 performed for [03 / 7536 / 03] and [03 / 7524 / 03] laminates. A possible reason for this phenomenon is also because the ERR associated with <b>the</b> cracks occurrence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> laminate become bigger as the middle ply becomes <b>thicker.</b> This causes <b>the</b> cracks to form at lower stress and strain and decreases the rate of new crack formation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thicker</b> laminates. For laminates with different off-axis ply angle, decrease from 90 o to 45 o makes crack formation more effort demanding. For example, in Fig.  15, none of the edge cracks propagated entirely through the coupon width. Similar results were obtained for CFRP [2] laminates.|$|R
5|$|During warmer weather, {{the wood}} turtle {{stays in the}} water for a larger {{percentage}} of the time. For this reason, during the winter months (and the late fall and early spring) it is considered an aquatic turtle. November through February or March is spent in hibernation {{at the bottom of a}} small, flowing river. The wood turtle may hibernate alone or in large groups. During this period, individuals bury themselves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> mud at the bottom of the river and rarely move. During hibernation, it is vulnerable to flash floods. Emergence does not occur until March or sometimes April, months that mark the beginning of its activation period (males are typically more active than females at this time).|$|E
5|$|Heraclius the Elder resurfaces a year later, {{under the}} command of Comentiolus, in the Battle of Sisarbanon (autumn 589), in the {{vicinity}} of Nisibis. According to the account of Theophylact, Comentiolus supposedly fled towards Theodosiopolis (modern Ra's al-'Ayn) while the battle was still ongoing. Heraclius the Elder took charge of the remaining troops and led them to victory. Theophylact, however, lived and wrote during the reign of Heraclius the Younger, and is strongly biased in favour of his father. His account is thus suspect of exaggerating or even inventing Comentiolus' cowardice with the aim of glorifying Heraclius the Elder. The contemporary Evagrius Scholasticus, for instance, credits Comentiolus with being <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> of combat, and does not mention Heraclius the Elder at all.|$|E

On 16 April 1968, Company A 1/9 Marines began a patrol southwest of Hill 689, when it was ambushed by NVA soldiers in bunkers concealed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> vegetation. Two more companies from 1/9 Marines were dispatched to save them, but they became ensnarled in this confusing battle and were unable to disengage until the early morning of 17 April.

5|$|Once Edward had {{regained the}} support of Clarence, he mounted a swift and decisive {{campaign}} to regain the Crown through combat; {{it is believed that}} Richard was his principal lieutenant as some of the king's earliest support came from members of Richard's affinity, including Sir James Harrington and Sir William Parr, who brought 600 men-at-arms to them at Doncaster. He may have led the vanguard at the Battle of Barnet, in his first command, on 14 April 1471, where he outflanked the Duke of Exeter's wing, although the degree to which his command was fundamental may have been exaggerated. That his personal household sustained losses indicates he was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> of the fighting. A contemporary source is clear about his holding the vanguard for Edward at Tewkesbury, deployed against the Lancastrian vanguard under the Duke of Somerset on 4 May 1471, and his role two days later, as Constable of England, sitting alongside John Howard as Earl Marshal, in the trial and sentencing of leading Lancastrians captured after the battle.|$|E

5|$|That September, McKinley's {{regiment}} {{was called}} east to reinforce General John Pope's Army of Virginia at the Second Battle of Bull Run. Delayed in passing through Washington, D.C., the 23rd Ohio did not arrive {{in time for}} the battle, but joined the Army of the Potomac as it hurried north to cut off Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia as it advanced into Maryland. The 23rd was the first regiment to encounter the Confederates at the Battle of South Mountain on September 14. After severe losses, Union forces drove back the Confederates and continued to Sharpsburg, Maryland, where they engaged Lee's army at the Battle of Antietam, one of the bloodiest battles of the war. The 23rd was also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> of the fighting at Antietam, and McKinley himself came under heavy fire when bringing rations to the men on the line. McKinley's regiment again suffered many casualties, but the Army of the Potomac was victorious and the Confederates retreated into Virginia.

5|$|Always <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> of {{the action}} during this campaign, on 24 February, Nansouty was present {{near the city of}} Troyes. Negotiations for an {{armistice}} were ongoing in a village nearby and, despite formal orders to continue the fighting, the two armies had ceased the combat. Nansouty then took his men and attacked enemy troops, charging into the streets of the village where the negotiations were taking place. The French envoy to the armistice talks, Monsieur de Flahaut saw this development and found Nansouty, bitterly protesting against the latter's action. Nansouty responded that the Emperor was doubtlessly aware that negotiations were indeed taking place there, but that he had orders to capture the position without further delay. On 27 February, the Emperor again moved against Blücher's Prussians, leaving a part of his forces near Troyes to observe the movement of Prince of Schwarzenberg's Austrian army. Nansouty, with the Guard cavalry, accompanied the Emperor, ensuring his protection and clearing his way after a bloody cavalry skirmish at Château-Thierry on 3 March. Another cavalry skirmish occurred on 5 March, with Nansouty repulsing a numerous enemy cavalry, 3,000-4,000 troopers, and capturing the bridge of Berry-au-Bac, over the Aisne, despite the enemy cannonade. Once across the Aisne with a few Polish lancer platoons, Nansouty launched a heroic pursuit, capturing enemy cannons and munitions, and taking a significant number of prisoners, among whom was the teenage Russian Prince Gagarin.|$|E
