5|$|Nonetheless, Iacob Ber Ghimpel, {{who owned}} a Yiddish theater there, was <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a figure of Goldfaden's stature. Goldfaden {{completed}} the play he'd started in Paris, Rabi Yoselman, oder Die Gzerot fun Alsas ("Rabbi Yoselman, or The Alsatian Decree"), in five acts and 23 scenes, based {{on the life of}} Josel of Rosheim. At this time he also wrote an operetta Rothschild and a semi-autobiographical play called Mashiach Tzeiten (Messiah Times) that gave a less-than-optimistic view of America.|$|E
5|$|Yesterday, as my orderly {{was holding}} my horse, I asked {{him where he}} was from. He said he was from Hawaii! He {{proved to be a}} full-blood Kanaka, by the name of Kealoha, who came from the Islands last year. There is also another, by the name of Kaiwi, who lived near Judge Smith's, who left the Islands last July. I enjoyed seeing them very much and we had a good jabber in kanaka. Kealoha is a private in the 41st Regiment US Colored Troops, and Kaiwi is a Private in the 28th U.S.C.T., in the pioneer corps. Both are good men and seemed <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> seen me.|$|E

He was the first Eagles player to be inducted. Clarke Hinkle presented him with the honor at the induction ceremony. Van Buren's acceptance speech consisted of four sentences:Thank you Clarke Hinkle, I'm certainly <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> broken your record. Since you people can't hear too good and I'm not too good a speaker I won't say much, but it's a great honor to be here. The two days I've spent in Canton will certainly bring me back every year from now on. Thank you very much.|$|E

5|$|Connor {{appears in}} the Family Reunion arc of Angel & Faith. Willow, on a quest to restore magic to herself and the world asks Angel and Faith to travel from London to LA with her so she can use the {{residual}} magic in Buffy's scythe and Connor's connection to Quor'toth to reopen the tear in reality at the Hyperion Hotel {{to get to a}} dimension that has magic. Angel & Faith agree to this in order to gain the piece of Giles's soul in the scythe, but will only help reopen the tear and go to Quor'toth if Connor agrees to it. Connor is living a normal life as a college student studying social work with a girlfriend. Though initially disappointed Angel ignored his attempts to contact his father, Connor is <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Angel in his life and realizes that his normal life is precious, but he still wants Angel {{to be a part of}} it. Angel is genuinely proud of the man his son has become. Connor agrees that magic needs to be returned to the world as the most vulnerable in society are already starting to lose hope without it.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} Marines, {{there was a}} small {{civilian}} caretaker presence on the island consisting of Kuwaiti citizens, as well as a few shop owners, which surprised the Marines a little bit as they were under the impression that the island was deserted. Nevertheless, the Marines felt very safe and secure on the island as Kuwait was an ostensibly U.S.-allied country, the Kuwaiti government told them it was safe, and {{there was a small}} contingent of Kuwaiti police there as well. In addition, the Kuwaiti civilians with whom the Marines interacted with were friendly and were ostensibly <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> U.S. military forces in their country.|$|E
25|$|Insull {{was born}} on November 11, 1859, in London, the son of Samuel Insull, a {{tradesman}} and lay preacher who {{was active in the}} Temperance movement, and Emma Short. He had a brother, Martin Insull. His career began as an apprentice clerk for various local businesses at age 14. He {{went on to become a}} stenographer at Vanity Fair. Through a newspaper ad, the 19-year-old became the switchboard operator for the London office of Edison's telephone companies. When he learned of a job with Edison in the US, Insull indicated he would be <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> it, provided it was as Thomas Edison's personal secretary.|$|E

25|$|At the 1921 Imperial Conference British Prime Minister Lloyd George said: In {{recognition}} of their service and achievements during the war, the British Dominions have now been accepted fully into the comity of {{the nations of the}} whole world. They are signatories to the Treaty of Versailles and all other treaties of peace. They are members of the Assembly of the League of Nations, and their representatives have already attended meetings of the League. In other words, they have achieved full national status and they now stand beside the United Kingdom as equal partners in the dignities and responsibilities of the British Commonwealth. If there are any means by which that status can be rendered even more clear to their own communities and to the world at large, we shall be <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> them put forward.|$|E
25|$|You have no {{idea what}} sending on those checks to me at this time. After {{fighting}} for an idea all your life I realize that your backing has saved it for me and meant to thank you with all my heart and soul for what you have done. It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were about all I could muster up enough energy to do what I considered the best of my ability. Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E
25|$|Andrew Kooman is {{an author}} and playwright. All of Kooman's {{writings}} focus on justice {{and many of the}} issues he writes about are gender-based. Kooman's first literary reaction to human trafficking was to write some short stories. Eventually, he also started writing the play that became She Has a Name in order to bring attention to the issue of human trafficking, specifically in its connections to sexual exploitation. In 2009, the script of She Has a Name was given the Scripts At Work/Alberta Playwrights Network Award. By February 2012, Kooman was working on a screenplay version of She Has a Name in order to expose it to a larger audience. Some Americans expressed an interest in staging She Has a Name in the United States. After starting to write this play, Kooman read about the Ranong human-trafficking incident in a Canadian newspaper and also heard about it through a friend of his who was working at an aftercare centre in Bangkok, Thailand to restore the dignity of former sex workers. Knowing that many of the impoverished girls who are smuggled in this manner become enslaved in brothels as child prostitutes, Kooman used the incident in the backstory of the play. There was a tour of She Has a Name in 2012, and the final performances were held in Red Deer. Kooman was <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the tour conclude in his hometown because the people of Central Alberta were very supportive of the play. During the tour, Kooman was awarded the Outstanding Alumnus Provincial Award Celebrating Excellence (PACE) by the Alberta Association of Colleges & Technical Institutes (AACTI) and the Alberta Ministry of Enterprise. In conjunction with this award, a $5000 scholarship was set up in Kooman's name, which he chose to have awarded to students who evince creativity, leadership, and a commitment to those who are in need. The PACE Award ceremony is biennial, and took place on June 13 in Edmonton at the AACTI Board of Governors Conference.|$|E

In an interview about the character's impact, Jeanmarie commented that he was <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been a part of the taboo-breaking story.

He pointed out that he was <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> escaped with Sagan as they worked well together – they had arrived at the finish of the 2014 Strade Bianche in a similar situation, with Kwiatkowski the winner there as well.

500|$|Moore {{made her}} Broadway {{debut in the}} world premiere of David Hare's play The Vertical Hour. The production, {{directed}} by Sam Mendes and co-starring Bill Nighy, opened in November 2006. Moore played the role of Nadia, a former war correspondent who finds her views on the 2003 invasion of Iraq challenged. Ben Brantley of The New York Times was unenthusiastic about the production, and described Moore as miscast: in his opinion, she failed to bring the [...] "tough, assertive" [...] quality that Nadia required. David Rooney of Variety criticized her [...] "lack of stage technique", adding that she appeared [...] "stiffly self-conscious". Moore later confessed that she found performing on Broadway difficult and had not connected with the medium, but was <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> experimented with it. The play closed in March 2007 after 117 performances.|$|E
500|$|Rousseau {{is named}} after French-Swiss philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Although Rousseau is French, actress Mira Furlan is Croatian, which led to {{speculation}} that Rousseau is not really from France.

Furlan understood Rousseau's decision to not meet her daughter, believing that no one can ever be prepared for that moment. Furlan met Raymonde for the first time just minutes before shooting their reunion scene in the season three finale. The actors believed the scene to be a [...] "huge moment" [...] for their characters, which Furlan described as a [...] "basic human moment."

500|$|Fegelein's {{politically}} motivated marriage to Gretl Braun, Eva Braun's sister, {{took place on}} 3 June 1944 in Salzburg. Historians Kershaw and Shirer believe he courted Braun {{as a way to}} advance his career. Hitler, Himmler and Martin Bormann acted as witnesses at the ceremony. A two-day celebration was then held at Hitler's and Bormann's Obersalzberg mountain homes and the Eagle's Nest. Fegelein was a known playboy and had many extramarital affairs. Hitler's secretaries, Christa Schroeder and Traudl Junge, state Fegelein was popular socially, particularly with women. He could be funny, amusing and charming. After his marriage to Gretl, Eva was <b>glad</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> someone in the entourage with whom she could dance and flirt, as Hitler was distant in social situations and refrained from publicly showing affection. Thereafter, Fegelein worked hard to develop a friendship with Hitler's powerful private secretary, Martin Bormann. Fegelein [...] "never missed" [...] Bormann's drinking parties and told Junge that the only things that mattered were [...] "his career and a life full of fun." ...|$|E
