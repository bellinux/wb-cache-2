5000|$|IBCT {{consists}} of two major phases, an evaluation/feedback phase and an active treatment phase. The first three sessions consist of an evaluation period where the therapist learns about {{the concerns of the}} couple. In the first session, the therapist usually sees both partners together, learns what brings the couple to therapy, and obtains a brief history of their relationship. The therapist may suggest couples read a self-help book during treatment that serves as a guideline for IBCT therapy. Also during this first session, the therapist normally gives each partner some questionnaires to complete and bring to their individual sessions, which are the next two sessions. In these individual sessions, the therapist explores each partner's relationship concerns and individual history. In the fourth session, the therapist sees both partners together for the [...] "feedback session." [...] The therapist may gather some <b>final</b> <b>information</b> {{in the beginning of the}} session, but most of the session is devoted to feedback from the therapist, in which he or she describes the couple's difficulties and strengths and how therapy will try to assist the couple. A major part of the feedback session is the therapist's formulation of the couple's problems, a conceptualization of the major themes in the couple's struggles, the understandable reasons why the couple has these struggles, how their efforts to resolve the struggles so often fail, and how therapy can help. The couple actively participates in this feedback, giving their reactions, adding information, and correcting the therapist's impressions as needed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the canonical sequential screening model and shows {{that when the}} agent has an ex post outside option, the principal does not benefit from eliciting the agent’s information sequentially.

The result extends to the multi–agent version of the problem...|$|E

To prevent {{medical errors}} or even accidents, our {{solution}} is to design the closed-loop application based on Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology in the Hospital Information System (HIS).

Image registration is a process in which <b>final</b> <b>information</b> is gained from different data sources. It is a process of aligning two images acquired by same/different sensors, at different times or from different viewpoint.
