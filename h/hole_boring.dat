50|$|The 1942 morale-raising film The Foreman Went to France {{was based}} on an {{employee}} of the Grantham factory. Melbourne Johns, from Pembrokeshire, was working at the Grantham factory and realised in 1940 that the Hispano-Suiza factory in France had important Deep <b>Hole</b> <b>Boring</b> Machines that could be of immense value to the Germans and set out on a mission with a team to recover the equipment. Finding the French factory and local village deserted, they drove the equipment back to England on a lorry. Melbourne Johns died in Grantham in 1955. The Deep <b>Hole</b> <b>Boring</b> Machine (DHBM), used for drilling the barrels of the guns, in the Grantham factory was very valuable, and was encased in a specially-made bomb-proof shelter.|$|E

5000|$|In machining, boring is {{the process}} of {{enlarging}} a hole that has already been drilled (or cast) by means of a single-point cutting tool (or of a boring head containing several such tools), such as in boring a gun barrel or an engine cylinder. Boring is used to achieve greater accuracy of the diameter of a hole, and can be used to cut a tapered <b>hole.</b> <b>Boring</b> can be viewed as the internal-diameter counterpart to turning, which cuts external diameters.|$|E

50|$|In {{the years}} between the World Wars {{a number of small}} works were {{established}} on North Quay, including a glass works, a small oil depot and an ICI plant for producing bromine-a fuel additive for high octane aviation fuel. This additive increased the power of aircraft such as Hurricanes, Spitfires, Lancasters and Mosquitoes. All are now closed and most of the buildings have been demolished. The metalworking business of J & F Pool, founded in 1862, survived in Copperhouse producing perforated and fabricated metal. The engineering tradition continues with the more recent small specialist firms of Bassett Engineering and Rigibore which specialise in tooling and precision engineering products from the Guildford Road Industrial Estate. Rigibore provides tooling to a global market and offers revolutionary products for <b>hole</b> <b>boring.</b> Bassett Engineering offer a wide range of engineering services to the Ministry of Defence.|$|E
5000|$|During the Iron Age, an {{extensive}} pre-Roman native settlement existed {{on the eastern}} headland of the bay, at {{what has come to}} be known as the East Wear Bay Site, or the Roman Villa Site. Beneath the remains of the Roman era villa lie the remains of a much older Iron Age oppidum that also served as a quern-stone production center. Quern-stones, or stones used to grind cereals into flour, were produced here on almost an industrial scale, using the local greensand stone from the Folkestone formation. [...] Over 200 querns have been recovered from the site, and most of them appear to have been discarded at some point during the process of production. Many have partially worked surfaces, or appear to have cracked during the <b>hole</b> <b>boring</b> stage. In addition to the numerous broken or unfinished querns, a layer of the excavation strata at the Villa/opidum site is entirely composed of greensand dust, which is almost certainly stone-working debris, suggesting that this was the location of the Iron Age era quern workshop.|$|E

Beneath the remains of the Romano-British villa was probably an Iron Age oppidum. Remains beneath the Roman villa suggest that querns, or stones used to grind cereal crops into flour, were produced here during the Iron Age on an almost industrial scale. Over 60 quern-stones have been recovered from the site of the villa and the lower cliff area. The querns are made of the local greensand stone, most likely collected or cut from nearby Copt Point and taken to the headland to be worked. The majority of the found querns are unfinished, with partially worked surfaces, or incomplete hoppers and spindle holes. In many cases, the querns appear to have been damages and discarded, many seeming to have fractured during the <b>hole</b> <b>boring</b> stage. In addition to the numerous broken or unfinished querns, a layer of the excavation strata at the Villa/opidum site is entirely composed of greensand dust, which is almost certainly stone-working debris, suggesting that this was the location of the Iron Age quern workshop.|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} of a high-power laser beam with plasma has been explored {{extensively in the}} context of laser-driven fusion, plasma-based acceleration of ions and electrons and high energy-density physics. One of the fundamental processes common to all these studies is the penetration of intense light into a dense matter through the <b>hole</b> <b>boring</b> effect and self-induced transparency. Light with a given wavelength will be reflected once the electron density equals the critical electron plasma density. The radiation pressure exerted on the critical density layer is characterized by the ponderomotive force of a focused laser pulse which scales with a laser intensity, as Wμm 2 /cm 2. At ~ 1017 Wμm 2 /cm 2 and above, it becomes possible for the laser pulse not only to steepen the plasma profile but to push the overcritical plasma with creating a cavity or a hole in the target. The phenomenon of <b>hole</b> <b>boring,</b> whereby a laser pulse propagates through a reduced density cavity to reach and push the critical density layer, is of importance in fast-ignition fusion because it may allow the laser pulse to deliver its energy closer to the compressed fuel where it can be converted into fast electrons that are needed to ignite {{a small portion of the}} fuel. The layer of plasma pushed by the radiation pressure can reflect and accelerate ions via the so called <b>Hole</b> <b>Boring</b> Radiation Pressure Acceleration mechanism. Also the density pile- up in combination with the strong electron heating at the critical density layer can facilitate the formation of a collisionless shock. This shock wave acceleration can produce high energy ion beams with a narrow energy spread. Numerous experiments have been carried out to study dynamics of laser plasma interaction indirectly using solid state targets that are opaque for 1 μm laser. However, by using a longer wavelength CO 2 laser, = 10. 6 μm, the critical plasma density is decreased by a factor of 100 (). Therefore overdense CO 2 laser plasma is transparent for a fast optical probe which opens a unique opportunity to study the physics of laser <b>hole</b> <b>boring</b> in the temporal and spatial domain simultaneously. This thesis reports the first direct measurements of the laser <b>hole</b> <b>boring</b> velocity in an overdense plasma using a four-frame picosecond green pulse interferometry. The plasma was created by tunnel ionization of a plume of He gas from a gas jet using a train of 3 ps long CO 2 laser pulses. For probing the plasma, a ~ 2 ps frequency-doubled (532 nm) Nd:Glass laser pulse is used in a four-frame interferometry scheme. Spatio-temporal dynamics of <b>hole</b> <b>boring</b> in CO 2 laser-plasma interaction at 2 × 1018 Wμm 2 /cm 2 are studied with a ~ 15 µm spatial and better than 2 ps time resolutions. Experimental measurements indicate the <b>hole</b> <b>boring</b> process is determined by a balance between the radiation pressure and thermal pressure. As a result of this competition, increases during the risetime of the laser pulse where but decreases with a larger slope rate on the falling edge. This is because the plasma electrons once heated cool slowly and diminishes the efficacy of even faster...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} how next-generation laser pulses at 10 - 200 PW interact {{with a solid}} target {{in the presence of}} a relativistically underdense preplasma produced by amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). Laser <b>hole</b> <b>boring</b> and relativistic transparency are strongly restrained due to the generation of electron-positron pairs and γ-ray photons via quantum electrodynamics (QED) processes. A pair plasma with a density above the initial preplasma density is formed, counteracting the electron-free channel produced by <b>hole</b> <b>boring.</b> This pair-dominated plasma can block laser transport and trigger an avalanchelike QED cascade, efficiently transferring the laser energy to the photons. This renders a 1 -μm scale-length, underdense preplasma completely opaque to laser pulses at this power level. The QED-induced opacity therefore sets much higher contrast requirements for such a pulse in solid-target experiments than expected by classical plasma physics. Our simulations show, for example, that proton acceleration from the rear of a solid with a preplasma would be strongly impaired...|$|E
