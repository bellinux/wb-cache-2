5|$|By 1980 all {{apart from}} the United Kingdom, Canada and Ireland had {{effectively}} completed their programs. In the United Kingdom the breakdown of voluntary metrication in the mid-1970s coincided with the United Kingdom's obligations {{as part of the}} EEC to adopt the metric system, resulting in legislation to force metrication in certain areas and the Eurosceptic movement adopting an anti-metrication stance and the United Kingdom seeking a number of <b>derogations</b> from the relevant EEC directives. Once the metrication of most consumer goods was completed in 2000, aspects of British life, especially in government, commerce and industry used SI. Although imperial units are widely encountered in unregulated areas such as the press and everyday speech, SI or units approved for use alongside SI are used in most areas where units of measure are regulated. High-profile exceptions include the sale of draught beer, the sale of milk in returnable containers, and United Kingdom road signs. Irish road signs (road distances and speeds) were converted to metric units during {{the first decade of the}} 21st century; otherwise, the situation in Ireland is similar to that in the United Kingdom.|$|E

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the nitrate directive, member states have the possibility to apply for <b>derogation,</b> i. e. increasing fertilization standards under certain conditions. Several EU regions have made use of this possibility but all in a different way. In 2009, 6 different <b>derogation</b> policies were worked out. This paper focuses on the differences between the applied policies and makes an assessment of the impact of these differences on the application rate of <b>derogation,</b> the manure surplus and the costs to allocate the manure. Based on the MP-MAS model described by Van der Straeten et al. (2010) the different scenarios are applied on a single case area (Flanders) and the economic effects have been simulated. Results show large differences between the policy alternatives, leading to the conclusion that member states not only have to focus on the permission to allow <b>derogation</b> or not but also at the details of the <b>derogation</b> policy. Granting <b>derogation</b> at parcel level instead of farm level increases the potential effect of <b>derogation,</b> the height of the increase in fertilization standards under <b>derogation</b> determines the application rate of derogation: a higher increase leads to a higher application rate.

40|$|The {{application}} of Art. 87 (1) EC to taxes above all {{is connected to}} the {{application of}} the <b>derogation</b> method, which appears {{to be part of the}} selectivity criterion. This dissertation examines the application of the <b>derogation</b> method and the assessment of the selectivity criterion applied to taxes, primarily de lege lata, but also de lege ferenda. It begins with an analysis of the relationship among the criteria of Article 87 (1) EC and continues with an analysis of the relationship between the <b>derogation</b> method and the assessment of the selectivity criterion applied to taxes. Several scholars have criticised the application of the <b>derogation</b> method because of the difficulty of identifying a <b>derogation</b> and of establishing the benchmark against which the <b>derogation</b> should be assessed. In this dissertation both the benchmark and the establishment of a <b>derogation</b> is analysed, partly with reference to the tax expenditure debate that occurred in the subject area of international taxation during the 1970 s and 1980 s. The selectivity criterion applied to taxes contains an assessment of justification, whereby the selective nature of a measure can be justified on the basis of the nature or general scheme of the system: Therfore the meaning and implications of this assessment are also examined. After all these issues have been examined de lege lata, the extents to which the application of the <b>derogation</b> method and the assessment of the selectivity criterion follow a logical system are discussed and recommendations for eliminating the identified deficiences are put forward...|$|R

40|$|From {{evolutionary}} reasoning, we derived a novel {{hypothesis that}} ingroup <b>derogation</b> is an adaptation {{to a special}} ecological condition in which the greater threat of aggression is incurred by ingroup members. This hypothesis was tested and supported across five studies. Specifically, the computational modeling found that ingroup <b>derogation</b> could easily evolve if the chance of death incurred by intragroup conflicts was no less than 10 %. Further behavioral experiments on Chinese participants showed that the ingroup <b>derogation</b> mechanism responded to heuristic social category cues and it responded more strongly when participants subjectively felt more vulnerable to interpersonal aggression, or when there were contextual cues of aggression in the immediate environment. Additional results showed that Chinese participants responded more strongly to aggression cues originating from ingroup members and that they endorsed more ingroup <b>derogation</b> attitudes even when the ingroup and outgroup members were both displaying cues of aggression. In addition, the results also revealed that the Chinese participants perceived more intentions of aggression from ingroup members than from outgroup members {{even in the absence}} of any clear signs of those intentions, and such a bias was positively correlated with ingroup <b>derogation</b> attitudes. Taken together, these results suggest that ingroup <b>derogation</b> is related to the evolved response of intragroup aggression management system...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we examine}} which role {{the size of}} the {{immigrant}} population plays in explaining immigrant <b>derogation</b> within and between European regions. We draw upon group threat- and intergroup contact theory to consider the following question: does a larger size of immigrant population increase perceived group threat and thereby lead to greater immigrant <b>derogation?</b> Or does it increase intergroup contact and thereby ameliorate immigrant <b>derogation?</b> We test the empirical adequacy of these alternative suggestions using regionalized European Social Survey 2002 and offi cial data which will be analyzed by means of multilevel structural equation modeling. Within regions, our results confi rm that perceived group threat increases subsequent immigrant <b>derogation.</b> Likewise, intergroup contact reduces perceived group threat and thereby amends such <b>derogation</b> of immigrants. Between regions, our fi ndings show that a larger size of the immigrant population increases both greater perceived group threat and intergroup contact. At the same time, the effects of perceived group threat and intergroup contact on immigrant <b>derogation</b> resemble those found within regions. In sum, these results lend evidence to the generalizability of both group threat- and contact effects. Implications of these fi ndings for future research are discussed.

40|$|This chapter {{argues for}} the use of new methods to assess racial {{prejudice}} because existing methods only provide a piecemeal understanding of the phenomenon, leading to an under-assessment of key constructs (e. g., ingroup favoritism, outgroup <b>derogation)</b> and provide no precision to assess new constructs, such as generalized outgroup <b>derogation</b> (negativity directed at all outgroups equally) and selective outgroup <b>derogation</b> (negativity directed at a specific outgroup or specific outgroups). The use of new response options, multiple targets, and multiple perceivers integrated into a single instrument is encouraged. The multidimensional architecture of the proposed instrument will allow researchers to uncover new constructs (e. g., selective or generalized outgroup <b>derogation)</b> and improve the assessment of existing constructs (e. g., ingroup favoritism, outgroup <b>derogation)</b> associated with racial prejudice. This chapter concludes by arguing that the methodological and theoretical clarity offered by these new methods in a single instrument will supplement and advance our understanding of racial prejudice, and that the approach is equally applicable to both the child and adult literatures...|$|R

50|$|In {{contrast}} to the temporary <b>derogations,</b> that are automatically discontinued {{after the end of}} the transitional period, the Mechanism for Cooperation and Verification is permanent and its discontinuation is conditional only on the positive assessment of benchmarks fulfillment in the regular reports issued by the Commission.

According to the treaties the new member states are obliged to fulfill the benchmarks for discontinuation of both these permanent <b>derogations</b> and the CVMs, but some of them deliberately delay these processes.

40|$|From {{evolutionary}} reasoning, we derived a novel {{hypothesis that}} ingroup <b>derogation</b> is an evolved response of behavioral immune system which follows the smoke detector principle and the functional flexibility principle. This hypothesis was tested and supported across three experiments. In Experiment 1, participants' group membership was manipulated {{by using a}} minimal group paradigm. The results indicated that mere social categorization alone - a heuristic cue that implies the differentiation between "us" and "them" - was sufficient to elicit ingroup <b>derogation</b> among Chinese participants, and, such an intergroup bias was positively associated with the perceived vulnerability to diseases, which was also more consistently associated with ingroup attitudes. Experiment 2 extended and partially replicated Experiment 1 by showing that when there were cues of diseases in the immediate physical environment, Chinese participants exaggerated their attitudes of ingroup <b>derogation.</b> The results also showed that this effect was mainly driven by outgroup attraction. Experiment 3 changed the method of disease manipulation, and found that Chinese participants responded more strongly to disease cues originating from ingroup members and that they endorsed more ingroup <b>derogation</b> attitudes even when the ingroup and outgroup members were both displaying cues of diseases. Taken together, these results reveal the previously unexplored effects of infectious diseases on ingroup <b>derogation</b> attitudes, and suggest an interesting linkage between the evolved behavioral immune system and the ingroup <b>derogation...</b>|$|R

Outgroup <b>derogation</b> is the phenomenon in which an outgroup is perceived as being threatening to the members of an ingroup.
