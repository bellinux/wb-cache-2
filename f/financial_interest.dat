5|$|Despite {{opposition}} from the Knights of Labor who eventually became supporters, on January 23, 1883 the Minneapolis Board of Trade passed resolutions to secure legislation to create a Board of Park Commissioners, and the city ratified a Park Act on April 3, 1883. Loring was the natural choice and was appointed the commission's first president. He was reelected each term and served until 1890 when he insisted on resigning because a property in which he held <b>financial</b> <b>interest</b> was under park board consideration.|$|E
5|$|After {{the birth}} of their daughter, Edith in 1896, Louema {{revealed}} that the father of both Edith and her older brother, Harvey (1893), was C. W. Post. Though Post offered him <b>financial</b> <b>interest</b> in La Vita Inn and his prospective famous breakfast drink, Postum, provided Beilhart he would stay and work at the Inn. Outraged at his friend's betrayal, Beilhart ordered Post out of his house and left Battle Creek for Ohio. Louema left Jacob and took the children back to her family in Kansas in 1897. This experience undoubtedly had a profound effect upon Beilhart's view of marriage.|$|E

5|$|Construction of the Green Line {{south from}} L'Enfant Plaza began in July 1984 when WMATA issued {{a call for}} bids to tunnel under the Anacostia River. The firm of Harrison Western/Franki-Denys (a joint venture) was awarded the $25.6 million contract, with {{construction}} to begin in December 1984. WMATA delayed awarding the contract after American anti-apartheid activists alleged that a Belgian company with a minority <b>financial</b> <b>interest</b> in Franki-Denys did business with the racist white-led government of South Africa, but after the links were discovered to be extremely minor the contract was awarded.|$|E
5|$|In their {{forty years}} of {{practice}} after leaving medical school, doctors hear about what works through ad hoc oral traditions, from sales reps, colleagues or journals. But those colleagues {{can be in the}} pay of drug companies– often undisclosed– and the journals are too. And so are the patient groups. And finally, academic papers, which everyone thinks of as objective, are often covertly planned and written by people who work directly for the companies, without disclosure. Sometimes whole academic journals are even owned outright by one drug company. Aside from all this, for several of the most important and enduring problems in medicine, {{we have no idea what}} the best treatment is, because it's not in anyone's <b>financial</b> <b>interest</b> to conduct any trials at all.|$|E
5|$|The {{laws are}} {{concerned}} with setting and enforcing the penalties for transgressions {{at all levels of}} society; the severity of the fine depended on the social rank of the victim.

5|$|Anderson {{initially}} {{intended it}} to be a stand-alone short film, but shortly before filming commenced, he realized that Schwartzman's character bore a close resemblance to one of the protagonists of a feature film he was writing at the time. That film would begin production a year later as The Darjeeling Limited. Chevalier takes place two weeks before Schwartzman's character (named Jack Whitman in the feature) joins his two older brothers on a journey in India in Darjeeling. The dialogue between the characters at the end of Chevalier is recounted by Schwartzman's character to his brothers {{at the close of the}} feature film, in the form of an excerpt from a short story he has composed. Portman's character has a brief cameo in the feature. Fox Searchlight Pictures, the studio that backed Darjeeling, was unaware of the short until the feature had been made and claimed to have no <b>financial</b> <b>interest</b> in it.|$|E
5|$|Giacomo Badoaro (1602–1654) was a {{prolific}} poet in the Venetian dialect {{who was a}} member of the Accademia degli Incogniti, a group of free-thinking intellectuals interested in promoting musical theatre in Venice—Badoaro himself held a <b>financial</b> <b>interest</b> in the Teatro Novissimo. Il ritorno was his first libretto; he would later, in 1644, write another Ulysses-based libretto for Francesco Sacrati. The text of Il ritorno, originally written in five acts but later reorganised as three, is a generally faithful adaptation of Homer's Odyssey, Books 13–23, with some characterisations altered or expanded. Badoaro may have been influenced in his treatment of the story by the 1591 play Penelope by Giambattista della Porta. The libretto was written with the express purpose of tempting Monteverdi to enter the world of Venetian opera, and it evidently captured the elderly composer's imagination. Badoaro and Monteverdi used a classical story to illustrate the human condition of their own times.|$|E
5|$|The XJ220 was not {{initially}} {{intended to be}} a production car, but, following the reception of the concept and <b>financial</b> <b>interest</b> from serious buyers, a feasibility study was carried out by teams from TWR and Jaguar. Its conclusion was that such a car would be technically feasible (subject to engineering changes), {{and that it would be}} financially viable. The announcement of a limited production run of 220 to 350 cars came on 20 December 1989. The list price on 1 January 1990 was £290,000 exclusive of value added tax, options and delivery charges, but by 1992 that had increased considerably owing to indexation of contracts. The offer was four times oversubscribed, and deposits of £50,000 exclusive of Value Added Tax (VAT) were taken from around 1400 customers; first deliveries were planned for mid-1992.|$|E

5|$|The war {{had three}} phases. Initially {{it was a}} {{localized}} feud between supporters of Gebhard {{and those of the}} Catholic core of the Cathedral Chapter. With the election of Ernst of Bavaria as a competing archbishop, what had been a local conflict expanded in scale: Ernst's election guaranteed the military, diplomatic, and <b>financial</b> <b>interest</b> of the Wittelsbach family in the Electorate of Cologne's local affairs. After the deaths of Louis VI, Elector Palatine in 1583and William the Silent in 1584, the conflict shifted gears again, as the two evenly matched combatants sought outside assistance to break the stalemate. Finally, the intervention of Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma, who had at his command the Spanish Army of Flanders, threw {{the balance of power in}} favor of the Catholic side. By 1588, Spanish forces had pushed Gebhard from the Electorate. In 1588 he took refuge in Strassburg, and the remaining Protestant strongholds of the Electorate fell to Parma's forces in 1589.|$|E
5|$|Luther lists several criticisms {{advanced}} by laypeople against indulgences in theses 81–91. He presents these as difficult objections his congregants are bringing {{rather than his}} own criticisms. How should he answer those who ask why the pope does not simply empty purgatory {{if it is in}} his power? What should he say to those who ask why anniversary masses for the dead, which were for the sake of those in purgatory, continued for those who had been redeemed by an indulgence? Luther claimed that it seemed strange to some that pious people in purgatory could be redeemed by living impious people. Luther also mentions the question of why the pope, who is very rich, requires money from poor believers to build St. Peter's Basilica. Luther claims that ignoring these questions risks allowing people to ridicule the pope. He appeals to the pope's <b>financial</b> <b>interest,</b> saying that if the preachers limited their preaching in accordance with Luther's positions on indulgences (which he claimed was also the pope's position), the objections would cease to be relevant. Luther closes the Theses by exhorting Christians to imitate Christ even if it brings pain and suffering. Enduring punishment and entering heaven is preferable to false security.|$|E

The author has analyzes the importance of <b>financial</b> <b>interests</b> of the state, local governments within the budgetary activities and legal means of guaranteeing <b>financial</b> <b>interests</b> of the state both {{at the state and local}} budgets, which must be fully satisfied in accordance with the amount of funds approved by the budget law or decision o about local budget.

Considering the fact that there is no common approach to establish the types of public interest in the budget process within the modern legal doctrine, the author considers the essence of the category ?<b>financial</b> <b>interests</b> of the state? and defines its public character. <b>Financial</b> <b>interests</b> in the budget process are related to the formation, distribution and use of budgetary funds and are implemented at all levels of budget system within the activities of the participants of the budget process while realizing the budget expenditure.
