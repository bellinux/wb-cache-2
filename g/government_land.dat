The NIC was dissolved in 1999 and all assets and liabilities became vested in the national <b>government.</b> <b>Land</b> tenure on Nauru is unusual: all Nauruans have certain rights to all land on the island, {{which is owned by}} individuals and family groups. Government and corporate entities do not own any land, and they must enter into a lease arrangement with landowners to use land. Non-Nauruans cannot own land on the island.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the floods, several citizens' groups and {{political}} parties, notably the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), strongly recommended that Tiruchirappalli be designated as the second, administrative capital of Tamil Nadu, due to its centralised location, the presence of a large international airport, a low level of congestion, the availability of vacant <b>government</b> <b>land</b> and a decreased likelihood of flooding. PMK leader S. Ramadoss said the party would seriously consider the matter if it came to power.|$|E
5|$|Oldham's {{townscape}} {{was dominated}} by distinctive rectangular brick-built mills. Oldham was hit hard by the Lancashire Cotton Famine of 1861–1865, when supplies of raw cotton from the United States were cut off. Wholly reliant upon the textile industry, the cotton famine created chronic unemployment in the town. By 1863 a committee had been formed, and with aid from central <b>government,</b> <b>land</b> was purchased {{with the intention of}} employing local cotton workers to construct Alexandra Park, which opened on 28 August 1865. Said to have over-relied upon the textile sector, as the importation of cheaper foreign yarns grew during the 20th century, Oldham's economy declined into a depression, although it was not until 1964 that Oldham ceased to be the largest centre of cotton spinning. In spite of efforts to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of its production, the last cotton spun in the town was in 1998.|$|E

5|$|The worst {{loss of life}} in United States history due to a {{wildfire}} {{occurred in}} 1871 when the Peshtigo Fire swept through Wisconsin, killing more than 1500 people. The Santiago Canyon Fire of 1889 in California and especially the Great Fire of 1910 in Montana and Idaho contributed to the philosophy that fire was a danger {{that needed to be}} suppressed. The Great Fire of 1910 burned , destroyed a number of communities and killed 86 people, and this event prompted various land management agencies to emphasize wildfire suppression. U.S. <b>Government</b> <b>land</b> agencies, including the National Park Service, generally followed the fire management policies established by the U.S. Forest Service, which oversees the majority of the nation's forestlands.|$|E
5|$|According to the Provisional Population Totals 2011 {{census of}} India, the {{population}} of Gangtok Municipal Corporation has been estimated to be 98,658. Males constituted 53% {{of the population and}} females 47%. The Gangtok subdivision of the East Sikkim district had a population of 281,293, Gangtok has an average literacy rate of 82.17%, higher than the national average of 74%: male literacy is 85.33%, and female literacy is 78.68. About 8% of Gangtok's population live in the nine notified slums and squatter settlements, all on <b>Government</b> <b>land.</b> More people live in areas that depict slum-like characteristics but have not been notified as slums yet because they have developed on private land. Of the total urban population of Sikkim, Gangtok Municipal Corporation has a share of 55.5%. Including Gangtok, East District has a share of 88% of the total urban population. The quality of life, the pace of development and availability of basic infrastructure and employment prospects has been the major cause for rapid migration to the city. With this migration, the urban services are under pressure, intensified by the lack of availability of suitable land for infrastructure development.|$|E
5|$|Immediately upon {{taking his}} seat in the Senate, Crittenden {{was named to the}} Committee on Public Lands and the Committee on the Judiciary, {{probably}} due to Clay's influence. Early in his term, Crittenden vociferously opposed Senator Thomas H. Benton's proposal to spend the federal budget surplus on public land graduation and military fortifications along the eastern seaboard. He also blasted the Jackson administration for issuing the Specie Circular, requiring that all payment for <b>government</b> <b>land</b> be made in gold or silver. He pointed out that the principles of the circular had been presented in a resolution on the Senate floor, but had been tabled by a large majority. Crittenden maintained that the tabling of the resolution was a condemnation by the Senate, yet the administration issued the circular only months later, overstepping, as Crittenden saw it, the bounds of the executive branch's authority. Crittenden debated the issue at length with Senator Benton, and Congress ultimately passed a bill requiring the government to accept the notes of specie-paying banks for the purchase of government lands, but President Jackson employed his pocket veto to prevent it from becoming law.|$|E

30|$|Landuse—The great {{majority}} of land is used for pastoral production, especially the grazing of cattle (Bos taurus and Bos indicus), and also sheep in parts of western QLD.

Also, in the NT, lands set aside for conservation purposes include significant areas under Aboriginal freehold tenure (eg., Kakadu and Nitmiluk National Parks). Despite the small area used for mining purposes, such landuse constitutes by far the greatest economic return to the regional economy (Gray 1996).|$|R
