Data: Two types of clinical records obtained {{prior to and}} post- presurgical: (1) digital scans of nasal casts (N = 35); (2) 3 dMD <b>facial</b> <b>scans</b> (N = 69); 34 of which had repeated <b>facial</b> <b>scans</b> on the same day. Main Outcome Measures: (1) columellar angle; (2) columella length on the noncleft or right side; (3) columella length on the cleft or left side; (4) nasal alar base width on the noncleft or right side; (5) nasal alar base width on the cleft or left side; (6) inter-endocanthal width; (7) nostril dome curvature. Results: There {{were no significant differences}} (p >. 05) between nasolabial measurements obtained from nasal casts and 3 dMD <b>facial</b> <b>scans.</b> Both records can be measured with good intra-rater reliabilities except the nasal alar base width and inter-endocanthal width (p <. 005). However, the discrepancies are not clinically significant. Reliability between two raters based on 20 casts and 20 <b>facial</b> <b>scans</b> is also good.

40|$|Face {{recognition}} from 3 D shape data {{has been proposed}} {{as a method of}} biometric identification as a way of either supplementing or reinforcing a 2 D approach. This paper presents a 3 D face recognition system capable of recognizing the identity of an individual from a 3 D <b>facial</b> <b>scan</b> in any pose across the view-sphere, by suitably comparing it with a set of models (all in frontal pose) stored in a database. The system makes use of only 3 D shape data, ignoring textural information completely. Firstly, we propose a generic learning strategy using support vector regression [2] to estimate the approximate pose of a 3 D head. The support vector machine (SVM) is trained on range images in several poses belonging to only a small set of individuals and is able to coarsely estimate the pose of any unseen <b>facial</b> <b>scan.</b> Secondly, we propose a hierarchical twostep strategy to normalize a <b>facial</b> <b>scan</b> to a nearly frontal pose before performing any recognition. The first step consists of either a coarse normalization making use of facial features or the generic learning algorithm using the SVM. This is followed by an iterative technique to refine the alignment to the frontal pose, which is basically an improved form of the Iterated Closest Point Algorithm [8].

40|$|Basic {{components}} of the conventional prosthodontic diagnostic set-up workï¬ow include dental cast models, full-mouth two-dimensional digital photographs, as well as selected intra- and extra-oral radiographs. This set-up provides a limited two-dimen-sional representation of the maxillofacial region and fails to depict the patient in full three dimensions, thereby limiting diagnosis and treatment planning. Novel three-dimensional (3 D) imaging technologies such as digital intra-oral scanning and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) are becoming increasingly available in the dental ofï¬ce. However, these technologies are limited in capturing the dentition and alveolar bone due to little regard to the soft tissue proï¬le. <b>Facial</b> <b>scanning</b> is a rapidly evolving technol-ogy {{with a wide range}} of applications in the ï¬elds of biomedical engineering, industrial design and 3 D animations.

40|$|Objective: For {{the use of}} Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) in orthodontics, {{radiation}} exposure should be kept at a minimum for the patient. The {{radiation exposure}} {{is closely related to}} the size of the used field of view (FOV). It will be shown that the additional use of a radiation-free face scan the medium FOV (diameter 16 cm x height 16 cm) is sufficient for orthodontic diagnosis of all patients. Methods: For this work, existing CBCT data were evaluated by means of a planning software. 1, 000 patient records were anonymized, and sets of data according to sex (m/f) and age (â¥ 18 / < 18 years) were created. For each of the resulting four CBCT data sets, or patient groups, an orthodontic diagnosis (FRS analysis) was carried out. The FRS-analysis was simulated using two different FOV sizes (medium and large FOV). In addition, a <b>facial</b> <b>scan</b> was simulated. Each FOV was moved in dorsal direction by the area of soft tissue detected in the face scan. Results: While all reference points necessary for FRS analysis can be captured by a large FOV. The medium FOV does not suffice detect the dorsal reference points in all male patients. This is also true for older patients compared with younger patients. However, 99 % of the reference points can be captured in all patient groups when a medium FOV is combined with a radiation-free face scan. There is no significant difference in the detection of reference points between a large FOV and a medium FOV in combination with a face scan. A medium FOV is also sufficient to capture the 4 th cervical vertebra in 100 % of patients under 18 years. Conclusion: Just as a large FOV, the combination of a medium FOV with a <b>facial</b> <b>scan</b> can capture all reference points of a cephalometric analysis to a sufficient degree in all patients, regardless of age and sex. Thus, by combining a medium FOV with a <b>facial</b> <b>scan</b> the radiation exposure of the patient can be reduced while a constant standard of diagnostic information can be maintained...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{increasingly}} {{widespread use}} of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) in orthodontics {{has given rise to}} vivid discussions about radiation doses, costs, and scan volumes (known as âfield of viewâ or FoV). This study aimed to examine whether a CBCT scanner with a spherical FoV 75 mm in radius would capture all the landmarks needed for cephalometric treatment planning. Another goal was to investigate if optical facial scans, used in combination with a CBCT scan, could open the door to capturing additional landmarks not otherwise accessible. Other points of evaluation were the size requirement for a spherical FoV that would cover 95 % of all patients and how many landmarks are needed to optimize positioning of the spherical FoV. Methods. A total of 1, 003 anonymized DICOM datasets were selected for this retrospective study from the MesantisÂ® radiographic network. After graphic processing with InVivo 4. 0 (Anatomage Inc., San Jose, CA, USA), the datasets were imported into a specially developed software application and were aligned using anterior landmarks as reference. Based on 17 landmarks, two measurement series were conducted, simulating a CBCT scan either by itself or in combination with a <b>facial</b> <b>scan.</b> A total of 32, 758 coordinates thus acquired were checked for normal distribution, followed by presenting in tabular format the resultant frequencies at which the various landmarks were captured inside the defined FoV. A specially developed software application was used to calculate the centre of an ideal sphere defined by 17 landmarks, then calculating the combination of landmarks characterized by the closest proximity to the ideal sphere. Results. Landmarks in the dorsal region of the cranium were captured less frequently. Regardless of age and gender, the least frequently captured landmark was the porion, with relative frequencies ranging from 4. 01 % (males â¥ 18 years) to 83. 23 % (females < 18 years) based on CBCT scans alone. Using an additional <b>facial</b> <b>scan,</b> these frequencies ranged from 20. 94 % (males â¥ 18 years) to 93. 07 % (females < 18 years). Female patients under 18 offer the best chances of identifying all landmarks required. The reverse is true of adult men. Covering 95 % of all patients would require a FoV of 102. 35 Â± 7. 29 mm in radius. The best reference points for optimal positioning of a spherical FoV are the porion (bilaterally) along with the soft-tissue pogonion and the nose tip. Conclusions. A CBCT scan with a spherical FoV 75 mm in radius cannot acceptably capture all of the landmarks needed for cephalometric diagnostics, whether used by itself of in combination with a <b>facial</b> <b>scan...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractâThe {{uncontrolled}} {{conditions of}} real-world biometric applications pose {{a great challenge}} to any face recognition approach. The unconstrained acquisition of data from uncooperative subjects may result in facial scans with significant pose variations along the yaw axis. Such pose variations can cause extensive occlusions, resulting in missing data. In this paper, a novel 3 D face recognition method is proposed that uses facial symmetry to handle pose variations. It employs an automatic landmark detector that estimates pose and detects occluded areas for each <b>facial</b> <b>scan.</b> Subsequently, an Annotated Face Model is registered and fitted to the scan. During fitting, facial symmetry is used to overcome the challenges of missing data. The result is a pose invariant geometry image. Unlike existing methods that require frontal scans, the proposed method performs comparisons among interpose scans using a wavelet-based biometric signature. It is suitable for real-world applications as it only requires half of the face to be visible to the sensor. The proposed method was evaluated using databases from the University of Notre Dame and the University of Houston that, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, include the most challenging pose variations publicly available.

40|$|Abstract. Facial feature {{extraction}} {{is important in}} many face-related applications, such as face alignment for recognition. We propose a multimodal scheme to integrate 3 D (range) and 2 D (intensity) information provided from a <b>facial</b> <b>scan</b> to extract the feature points. Given a face scan, the foreground is segmented from the background using the range map and the face area is detected using a real-time intensity-based algorithm. A robust nose tip locator is presented. A statistical 3 D feature location model is applied after aligning the model with the nose tip. The shape index response derived from the range map and the cornerness response from the intensity map are combined to determine {{the positions of the}} corners of the eyes and the mouth. Real-world data is subject to sensor noise, resulting in spurious feature points. We introduce a local quality metric to automatically reject the scan whose sensor noise is above a certain threshold. As a result, a fully automatic multimodal face recognition system is developed. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations are conducted for the proposed {{feature extraction}} algorithm on a publicly available database, containing 946 facial scans of 267 subjects. This automatic feature extraction algorithm has been integrated in an automatic face recognition system. The identification performance on a database of 198 probe scans and 200 gallery subjects is close to that with manually labeled landmarks. ...|$|E
