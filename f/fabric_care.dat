50|$|Another major {{drawback}} of old washer dryers combos {{was that}} they took significantly longer to dry a batch of clothes in comparison to stand-alone dryers. Stand-alone dryers make use of hot air or other heating elements to dry the clothes in {{a fraction of the}} time that it took the condensation-based drying system in combination units. This was a drawback that was inherent to the washer dryer combo design, since the dryer had to work longer to dry the drum and its enclosure as well as the clothes inside the drum. On an average, clothes that weigh between 4 - 5 lb would have kept the machine working for no less than 4.5 hours.

50|$|A {{standalone}} Carrier Routing System is deployed with a Line card chassis (LCC). The {{three main}} functional units of this LCC are the Line cards, Switching fabric and Route processor. The Line card {{consists of the}} physical interface card and a modular services card. The physical connectivity could be using Fiber optic cables or using Twisted pair cables. The routing decisions are made by the route processor and the switching <b>fabric</b> takes <b>care</b> of the routing based on the Route processor input. The CRS runs IOS XR which {{is said to be}} designed for high-end carrier grade routers and was launched with CRS-1. In a multi-chassis deployment, the Line card chassis is used along with another variety of chassis called as the Fabric Card Chassis (FCC). The architecture enables scalability by increasing the number of Line Card Chassis and/or Fabric Card Chassis. In both single- and multi-chassis configurations, the CRS switch fabrics are based on a three-stage Beneš architecture. In a single-chassis system, the three switching stages—S1, S2, and S3—are all contained on one fabric card. In a multi-chassis system, the S2 stage is contained within the Fabric Card Chassis, with the S1 and S3 stages resident in the Line Card Chassis.|$|R
50|$|Recommended {{methods for}} {{removing}} dust on tapes include {{using a small}} vacuum with a hose or wipe with 3M Tape Cleaning <b>Fabric.</b> <b>Care</b> must be used when using a vacuum if a hose attachment is available.

They are generally correct to recommend this, {{as it is a}} delicate process that requires training if one plans to undertake serious chemical or physical repair. Vidipax, a professional tape restoration company, recommends using Pellon fabric or cloth as the safest and most efficient way to clean tapes. They warn against using solvents at all costs unless the tapes have already been submerged in water or another solvent (in the case of a flood).

30|$|Nowadays, {{the demand}} for {{antibacterial}} <b>fabric</b> and health <b>care</b> has increased; so, finding a method to get antibacterial textile is a challenge. Fibers, especially natural fibers (wool and cotton), provide basic requirements such as moisture and nutrients for bacterial growth and multiplication. This often leads to objectionable odor, dermal infection, product deterioration, and other related diseases[1, 2, 3, 4]. A variety of materials like quaternary ammonium salt, metal oxide nanoparticles, and nanocomposites are reported as antibacterial agents[1, 2, 3]. Using synthetic non-biodegradable chemical compounds for these approaches cause environmental and health concerns. Although natural dyes are {{known for a long}} time for dyeing as well as medicinal applications, the structures and protective properties have been recognized only in the recent past[4, 5]. Many of the plants used for dye extraction are classified as medicinal, and some of these have recently been shown to possess remarkable antimicrobial activity[6]. Several sources of plant dyes rich in naphthoquinons such as lawsone from henna, juglone from walnut, and lapachol from alkanet are reported to exhibit antibacterial and antifungal activities[7, 8, 9, 10].|$|R

30|$|Several {{limitations}} of the study were recognized and may be examined through further research. First, although many brands of washers are available on the market, only one conventional washer and one front-loading HE washer were used in the study. The wash action and setting of each washing machine may differ. More tests involving various washers are needed to verify the effects of washer on <b>fabric</b> <b>care</b> performances. Second, only a plain weave fabric was used in the current study, but different fabrics may behave in a different way when washed in different types of washers. Further studies using other types of fabric structures, such as knits or woven fabrics with other types of weaves (e.g., twill or satin weave), may be carried out. Third, only a black fabric was used in the current study. Although a fabric in a dark color was a better choice in comparing color change after washing, a black fabric might make the differences in stain removal harder to detect. Further studies may consider using a lighter color to verify the findings of stain removal in the current study. Fourth, only one type of laundry detergent and one type of dryer sheet softener were used. Chowdhary (2017) reported that a significant difference was found in dimensional stability between an AATCC standard detergent and a commercial detergent. Further studies may need to use different types of detergents or softeners to fully understand the role a detergent or softener plays in the <b>fabric</b> <b>care</b> performance of conventional and HE washers.|$|E
40|$|This article proposes the {{modelling}} {{and analysis}} of image texture using an extension of a locally stationary wavelet process model into two-dimensions for lattice processes.

We provide the necessary theoretical support to show that our two-dimensional extension is properly defined and has the proper statistical convergence properties. Our use of a statistical model permits us to identify, and correct for, a bias in established texture measures based on non-decimated wavelet techniques. The proposed method performs nearly as well as optimal Fourier techniques on stationary textures and outperforms them in non-stationary situations. We illustrate our techniques using pilled fabric data from a <b>fabric</b> <b>care</b> experiment and simulated tile data...|$|E
30|$|According to USA Today, HE washers {{became popular}} among US {{consumers}} in the late 2000 s (Wroclawski 2014); about 45 % of washers sold in the US in 2009 were HE washers.

40|$|Objectives The global {{population}} {{of elderly people}} is increasing at a remarkable rate, which {{may be expected to}} continue for some time. Older patients require more care, and with the current model of care delivery, the costs may be expected to rise, although higher cost is unsustainable. For this reason, a new pattern of practice is needed. Telemedicine will be presented as a highly effective and necessary tool in geriatrics. Methods This review will present some of the background and evidence for telemedicine as a way to address the challenges of geriatrics through geriatric telemedicine. Some of the evidence for the value of telemedicine as a tool for physicians and healthcare systems is presented. Results Telemedicine offers many means to address the problems of geriatric care in creative ways. The use of electronic medicine, telecommunications, and information management has now found its way into the very <b>fabric</b> of health <b>care.</b> The use of telemedicine is a fait accompli in much of the world, and it continues to have an increasing role deeply imbedded in our electronic practices coupled with social media.
