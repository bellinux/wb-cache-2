40|$|A new matrix resin was {{recently}} introduced for composite materials, based on acrylic resin chemistry allowing standard room temperature infusion techniques {{to be used}} to produce recyclable thermoplastic composites. This is a significant advance, particularly for more environmentally-friendly production of large marine structures such as boats. However, for such applications it is essential to demonstrate that composites produced with these resins resist sea water exposure in service. This paper presents results from a wet aging study of unreinforced acrylic and glass and carbon fibre reinforced acrylic composites. It is shown that the acrylic matrix resin is very stable in seawater, showing lower property losses after seawater aging than those of a commonly-used epoxy matrix resin. Carbon fibre reinforced acrylic also shows good property retention after aging, while reductions in glass fibre reinforced composite strengths suggest that specific glass <b>fibre</b> <b>sizing</b> may be required for optimum durability...|$|E

40|$|Glass fibre {{reinforcements}} {{form the}} foundation of a composite materials industry with a global annual production of greater than 10 million tons of high performance, light weight carbon footprint lowering materials. Possibly the most critical component involved in the manufacture of glass fibres and their composites is the <b>fibre</b> <b>sizing.</b> Yet because of the intense level of industrial secrecy around sizings there are very few people in the vast chain of composite materials suppliers, processers and end users who have more than a superficial understanding of what glass fibre sizings are and what they do. There are many questions which this large and growing composite community poses about glass fibre sizings. Which analytical techniques are most useful in sizing research? Who has published research results on sizing and their ingredients? Which silanes are the most researched for use in sizings? Which glass fibre manufacturers have reported research findings on sizings? This review will act as a guide to obtaining some of the answers to these and many other questions about glass fibre sizings. The composites materials industry is currently experiencing a period of intense growth in new application development due to the potential which light-weight high performance composite materials have to reduce the carbon footprint of many industries. Composite materials have been highly successful in such applications due to the synergy of combining two, or more, dissimilar materials to obtain a better performance than the sum of the individual components. Glass fibre has been particularly successful as the reinforcement in these composites. Today glass fibre products account for more than 95 % of fibre reinforcements used in the composites industry, primarily due to their highly attractive performance to price ratio. Possibly the most critical component involved in the manufacture of glass fibres and their composites is the <b>fibre</b> <b>sizing.</b> Sizing is a thin surface coating of mainly organic materials applied to nearly all types of man-made fibres during their manufacture. Given the well-recognized critical importance of sizing in all aspects of the profitability, processibility and performance of glass reinforced composites and consequently to the ultimate success of the composites industry, it is surprising (perhaps even astonishing) to note the lack of a proportionally sized body of fundamental and applied research publications on this subject. There can be few examples of such a large materials industry (global annual production well in excess of 10 million tons of fibre reinforced composites) where the manufacturing and performance of those materials are so critically dependent on such a small component that is so narrowly understood. The research and development of glass <b>fibre</b> <b>sizing</b> is inextricably linked to the intellectual property concerns of glass fibre manufacturers and consequently information {{on the nature of the}} technical challenges facing sizing developers is not openly available to the technical community. Despite these challenges there has been quite some work published in and around the subject of glass fibre sizings over the years. Given the importance of sizings to the continuing success and growth of the composites industry this review has collected and summarized a large proportion of the widely dispersed literature which is openly available around glass fibre sizings. The review should beneficial to academic researchers embarking on, or already working on, fundamental research in the area of glass fibre sizings and interfaces in glass reinforced composites. However, industrial readers from the composite materials supply chain and those engaged with end-use applications using glass reinforced polymers should also find the contents highly useful in improving their insight and understanding of this critical aspect of composite materials...|$|E

The weight change could be well modelled by a Fickian diffusion process with a time dependent diffusion coefficient. It was not apparent that changing the glass <b>fibre</b> <b>sizing</b> affected the dimensional stability of the composites. There was a strong correlation between the swelling of these samples and the level of fluid absorption. The composites exhibited different levels of swelling depending on direction.

The study is performed {{with the help of}} a two-scale 3 D finite element model based on the embedded region technique. The advantage of this model is that microscopic fibres and nanotubes are simulated together and with their actual dimensions. The studied modifications on the fibre surface are CNT growth with aligned or randomly oriented morphologies and <b>fibre</b> <b>sizing</b> with different CNT concentrations and orientations. The predictions show that the stress build-up in the broken fibre is not significantly affected by grown CNTs. The most significant effect is found for the densest CNT-reinforced sizing in which CNTs are aligned in the fibre direction.

In this study, polymer composites were prepared using oil palm empty fruit bunch (OPEFB) fibre at four different sizes (180 μm, 250 μm, 300 μm, and 355 μm) as the secondary filler that was added in the clay and Polypropylene mixture as their matrix. XRD was employed to investigate the presence of clay structure in composites. Meanwhile Flexural and impact tests (both notched and un-notched) were performed according to ASTM D 790 and D 256 to assess their mechanical performances. Results show that the increase of OPEFB <b>fibre</b> <b>size</b> has increased it flexural strength and modulus at smaller OPEFB <b>fibre</b> <b>size.</b> However a decrease of both flexural strength and flexural modulus was observed at higher OPEFB <b>fibre</b> <b>size,</b> which is believed due to the poor interfacial bonding between OPEFB and matrix. Meanwhile the impact strength for notched samples has slightly increased with the increase of OPEFB size and no increase was observed for the impact strength of un-notched composites.

Electrophysiological measurements of nerve <b>fibre</b> <b>size</b> and morphometric measurements of outer fibre perimeters and fibre areas concurred and demonstrated that myelinated nerve fibres supplying partially denervated MG muscles did not increase in size in parallel with the increase in the target size.

40|$|Abstract—The {{scanning}} {{electron microscope}} (SEM) method of <b>fibre</b> <b>sizing</b> assumes that all fibres lie flat on filters. This appears to be true for samples deposited from aqueous suspension, but in some airborne samples only about 60 % of fibres lie flat on the filter surface {{and many of the}} rest are balanced at high angles to the filter surface. These inclined fibres will appear foreshortened when the filter surface is viewed in conventional orientation during SEM analysis. This could lead to an underestimation of fibre length and some fibres may be so foreshortened that they do not appear to fulfil the criteria of a fibre. The results of a preliminary investigation of the effects of variable fibre inclination in fibre counts and size data for two fibre types suggest that the SEM data do give an underestimate of the number, length and therefore volume of longer fibres in some samples. This suggests {{that it is important to}} consider fibre inclination when SEM analysis of airborne fibre samples is performed. Our preliminary observations suggest that is unlikely that it will be possible to derive widely applicable correction factors to allow for orientation effects...|$|E

40|$|The use of poly(vinyl alcohol) PVA as a {{biodegradable}} polymer {{has been}} confined to low technology applications such as paper coatings and <b>fibre</b> <b>sizing,</b> which rely upon its inherently poor resistance to moisture to initiate degradation and ultimate disposal. Despite low-tech application of the material to date, PVA exhibits properties that are compatible with more sophisticated applications. The inclusion of natural fibres and fillers gives further improvements in mechanical properties without compromising overall degradability. However the potential of this material as an engineering polymer cannot be realised because of its limited moisture resistance which naturally limits the number of practical applications, particularly those that are exposed to diverse environmental conditions. Warwick Manufacturing Group has developed a waterproofing method that can be tailored to deliver a time-delayed degradation mechanism or even stop water ingress completely. Most importantly the biodegradability and mechanical properties of the PVA are not affected, just the time-scale. This tailoring is achieved through {{the inclusion of a}} biodegradable additive (that degrades via a different mechanism) that creates an advanced multifunctional sandwich structure, during the single-shot injection moulding process (i. e. not multi-component moulding), encapsulating the PVA.

40|$|Fibre-matrix {{adhesion}} affects fibre-reinforced composites' mechanical properties, {{a process}} which can be improved by applying appropriate sizing on the fibre. Transverse bending tests and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) can help quantify this effect This paper investigates if modal damping measurements are a reliable alternative for quantifying fibre-matrix adhesion. When a composite sample is vibrating, part of the dissipated energy {{is due to the}} internal friction. More internal friction and slipping at the fibre-matrix interface is expected with a weaker fibre-matrix bond, hence increasing the amount of dissipated energy, which in turn is proportional to the modal damping value. This paper researches two different cases to validate this hypothesis. In the first case, we will use two composite samples of flax fibre, one with and one without sizing. In the second case, we will compare flax and carbon fibre laminates. If the only variable is <b>fibre</b> <b>sizing,</b> better adhesion is related to significantly lower damping and higher resonance frequencies. If composite laminates with different fibre and matrix type are compared, lower adhesion is not necessarily related to increased damping and lower resonance frequencies. However, when combining the damping result with SEM microscopy, it is possible to assess the relative contribution to the internal energy dissipation of the fibre, the matrix and the fibre-matrix interface individually.

To manufacture blades in a vacuum-assisted resin infusion process (VARI), a binder {{is needed for}} fibre fixation and preform stability. Moreover, solubility and mechanical compatibility of the binder and the epoxy resin matrix are important parameters for processa-bility and the mechanical properties of the composite. The present study therefore character-ised and evaluated five chemically different binders {{with regard to their}} solubility in a rotor-blade-proven epoxy resin using microscopy, viscometry and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The solubility tests enabled a binder-classification into critically soluble (KE- 60, Epikote 05390), strongly soluble (Grilon MS), partially soluble (D 2433 E), and non-soluble (K- 140) binder types. In subsequent mechanical and thermo-mechanical testing of resin-binder plates, the strongly soluble binder Grilon MS showed the best performance, followed by the non-soluble binder K- 140 and the partially soluble binder D 2433 E. These results suggest that binders developing no interfaces within the resin should be preferred. Furthermore, interply adhesion for these three binders was investigated in a peeling test using fibre preforms. It was found that differences in peel strength might be controlled predominantly by different kinds of binder layer formations, but also to some extent by the different binder-fibre interaction (binder and <b>fibre</b> <b>sizing</b> correlation). Best performance was shown by D 2433 E, followed by Grilon MS and K- 140.

Composite and resin samples have been characterised both dry as moulded and after conditioning at either 120 °C or 150 °C for a range of times up to 1000 hours. The results reveal that hydrothermal ageing in water-glycol mixtures results in significant changes in the mechanical performance, weight, and dimensions of these materials. The negative effects of conditioning could be mitigated to some degree by the appropriate choice of the glass fibre sizing; however the sizing effect diminished with increasing conditioning time. All materials showed a weight increase due to conditioning at 120 °C which was typical of a single Fickian diffusion process and there was clear evidence of multiple processes involved when conditioning at 150 °C. It was not apparent that the glass <b>fibre</b> <b>sizing</b> affected the dimensional stability of the composites. We show that there is a strong correlation between the swelling of these samples and the level of fluid adsorption. Although the PA 66 resin showed reasonably homogeneous swelling, the composites exhibited different levels of swelling depending on direction. These effects were well in line with the known effects of fibres on restriction of the matrix deformation (mechanical, thermal or moisture swelling) in the fibre direction. These differences correlate well with the average fibre orientation with respect to the various direction axes.

40|$|Compared to {{thermoset}} composites, thermoplastic composites {{are drawing}} {{more and more}} attention by aircraft industries not only due to their excellent material properties but also due to their potentials to reduce cycle time and structure cost by using low-cost manufacturing technologies such as welding. Resistance welding has been {{regarded as one of}} the most promising welding techniques owing to the low energy consumption, simplicity of welding operation and capability for scaling up. Previous researches on resistance welding of thermoplastic composites are mainly focused on understanding the welding mechanisms and characterizing the welding qualities. The research work was aimed to gain deeper knowledge of resistance welding, in both micro-level and macro-level. In micro-level study, the specific properties that influence the welding quality were discussed, such as the surface properties of adherends, the weld line properties and the welding induced voids. In macro-level study, the emphasis was put on improving the current welding process, for both static resistance welding and continuous resistance welding. Micro-level study: 1. Resistance welding of woven fabric reinforced thermoplastic composites was investigated. Both the type of the majority fibres (warp yarns or weft yarns) and the apparent orientation of the majority fibres on the adherend surface were found to influence the failure mode and lap shear strength. <b>Fibre</b> <b>sizing</b> was found to be crucial for a good fibre-matrix adhesion, and therefore it was crucial for a good weld. 2. Other than fibre de-compaction, the residual volatiles inside the adherends was found to be a main cause of the voids in the joints for a welding process performed under a moderate welding pressure. Non-uniform void distribution was observed inside the joints, with void concentrations near the middle of weld overlap. The voids could be reduced by using pre-dried adherends or using a higher welding pressure. 3. A thinner weldline, usually obtained by using a thinner heating element, was found to be preferable to a thicker one. The relatively weaker welding quality near the edges of the joints was found to be a limitation of weld performance, but this could be improved by tailoring heat generation at the weld overlap or creating resin fillets near the edges. Micro-level study: 1. The possibility of using displacement measurement data for process monitoring and processing window definition was investigated, and it showed ability to detect voids generation and resin squeeze flow during welding and to construct processing windows. 2.

We show that superimposition of Estrogen Related Receptor Gamma (Errγ) on the Myostatin (Mtn) mouse null background (Mtn-/-/ErrγTg/+) results in hypertrophic muscle with a high oxidative capacity thus violating the inverse relationship between <b>fibre</b> <b>size</b> and oxidative capacity. We also examined the canonical view that oxidative muscle phenotype positively correlate with Satellite cell number, the resident stem cells of skeletal muscle. Surprisingly, hypertrophic fibres from Mtn-/-/ErrγTg/+ mouse showed satellite cell deficit which unexpectedly did not affect muscle regeneration. These observations 1) challenge the concept of a constraint between <b>fibre</b> <b>size</b> and oxidative capacity and 2) indicate the important role of the microcirculation in the regenerative capacity of a muscle even when satellite cell numbers are reduced...|$|R
40|$|Geopolymers {{have been}} {{suggested}} in the literature as matrix materials for fibre reinforced composites due to a unique combination of low-temperature synthesis and high temperature stability. This study investigated several key aspects of fibre reinforced geopolymer matrix composites {{in order to improve}} the basic knowledge of these materials. It was demonstrated that geopolymer matrix composites show great potential as fire-resistant materials for near room temperature applications. In particular, basalt fibre composites were of great interest due to their comparatively low cost and good mechanical performance. Microstructural investigations indicated that basalt fibres can potentially be used in geopolymer matrices up to 600 °C. However, the success of the application of geopolymer matrix composites at higher temperatures is seen as critical and depends on further development of suitable matrices. Several compositions within a sodium-metahalloysite model matrix system were evaluated in order to identify a suitable formulation for composite fabrication. An average compressive strength of ~ 79 MPa and flexural strength and modulus of ~ 10 MPa and 8. 5 GPa, respectively, were achieved for the best batch of the main matrix composition. By optimising the matrix composition, the mechanical properties could be significantly improved, achieving an extremely high maximum compressive strength value of 145 MPa. Issues with reproducibility and the influence of various aspects of the fabrication process are discussed. The room temperature flexural properties of unidirectional fibre reinforced composite bars with basalt, carbon and alumina fibres were investigated. Besides the fibre type, the effects of several other parameters including <b>fibre</b> <b>sizing,</b> matrix strength, span-to-depth ratio and specimen dimensions on the flexural properties and the failure behaviour of the composites were studied. Significant improvements to the mechanical properties were achieved with all fibre types. However, the mechanical behaviour was highly influenced by the elastic modulus of the fibre. Furthermore, it was shown that the composite properties were affected by the overall sample dimensions, the testing span and the mixing time of the geopolymer binder. The alumina fibre composites achieved the highest flexural stress with a maximum value of 470 MPa and a fibre content of ~ 30 vol. -%. Basalt and carbon fibre composites showed maximum flexural strength values around 200 MPa. Although all composite types displayed considerable post-fracture strength, only the basalt composites failed in tensile mode. The applicability of the weak matrix composites (WMC) concept to describe the mechanical behaviour of geopolymer matrix composites was discussed. The fibre-matrix interactions were analysed between room temperature and 1000 °C by means of electron microscopy, EDS and x-ray diffraction. All fibres were found to be chemically stable under the highly alkaline conditions of the geopolymer synthesis and showed no significant reaction with the geopolymer matrix at room temperature. The results indicate that basalt fibre composites may be used up to 600 °C without significant degradation of the fibre. The heating of the carbon fibre composites to 600 °C had drastic effect on the strength and integrity of the composite, in particular, when using sized carbon fibres. The alumina fibres showed good wetting and bonding behaviour but otherwise little reaction with the matrix even after heating to 1000 °C...|$|E
40|$|Background. We {{investigated}} serum testosterone and insulin-like {{growth factor}} 1 (IGF- 1) levels’ associations with muscle <b>fibre</b> <b>size</b> and resistance training in male dialysis patients. Methods. Male patients {{were included in}} a 16 -week control period followed by 16 weeks of resistance training thrice weekly. Blood samples were obtained to analyse testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), IGF- 1, and IGF-binding protein 3. Muscle fibres’ size was analysed in biopsies from m. vastus lateralis. Results. The patients’ testosterone levels were within the normal range at baseline (n= 20) (19. 5 (8. 2 – 52. 1) [*]nmol/L versus 17. 6 (16. 1 – 18. 0), resp.) whereas LH levels were higher (13. 0 (5. 5 – 82. 8) [*]U/L versus 4. 3 (3. 3 – 4. 6), P< 0. 001, resp.). IGF- 1 and IGF-binding protein 3 levels were higher in the patients compared with reference values (203 (59 – 590) [*]ng/mL versus 151 (128 – 276), P= 0. 014, and 5045 (3370 – 9370) [*]ng/mL versus 3244 (3020 – 3983), P< 0. 001, resp.). All hormone levels and muscle <b>fibre</b> <b>size</b> (n= 12) remained stable throughout the study. Age-adjusted IGF- 1 was associated with type 1 and 2 <b>fibre</b> <b>sizes</b> (P< 0. 05). Conclusion. Patients’ total testosterone values were normal due to markedly increased LH values, which suggest a compensated primary insufficiency of the testosterone producing Leydig cell. Even though testosterone values were normal, resistance training was not associated with muscle hypertrophy. This trial is registered with ISRCTN 72099857...|$|R

40|$|It {{is thought}} that the prime {{determinant}} of global muscle capillary density is the mean oxidative capacity. However, feedback control during maturational growth or adaptive remodelling of local muscle capillarisation {{is likely to be}} more complex than simply matching O 2 supply and demand in response to integrated tissue function. We tested the hypothesis that the maximal oxygen consumption (MO 2,max) supported by a capillary is relatively constant, and independent of the volume of tissue supplied (capillary domain). We demonstrate that local MO 2,max assessed by succinate dehydrogenase histochemistry: (1) varied more than 100 -fold between individual capillaries and (2) was positively correlated to capillary domain area in both human vastus lateralis (R= 0. 750, P< 0. 001) and soleus (R= 0. 697, P< 0. 001) muscles. This suggests that, in contrast to common assumptions, capillarisation is not primarily dictated by local oxidative capacity, but rather by factors such as <b>fibre</b> <b>size,</b> or consequences of differences in <b>fibre</b> <b>size</b> such as substrate delivery and metabolite removal...|$|R
