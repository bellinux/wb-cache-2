5|$|Epstein asked {{chartered}} accountant James Trevor Isherwood {{to set up}} a company to collect Lennon and McCartney's PRS payments—called Lenmac—which he did on 12 May 1964. When he first visited Epstein's office, Isherwood was surprised to learn that Epstein took 25 per cent of the <b>gross</b> <b>income,</b> and not the 10 per cent that he believed most other managers received at that time. All of Epstein's expenses were deducted from his artists' <b>gross</b> <b>income,</b> including office rental, staff wages, travel, telephone costs, and entertaining expenses. Before his death, Epstein knew that the renegotiation of his management contract (up for renewal on 30 September 1967), would lower his management fee from 25 to 10 per cent, and that NEMS would no longer receive a share of the Beatles' performance fees, reducing its revenues still further.|$|E

5|$|Culverhouse was {{described}} as late as 1982 as a rare owner who was popular with players, coaches, and fans. He was commended for allowing his staff to handle football operations without interference, and for having the patience to allow John McKay {{to follow through with}} his building plan despite the franchise's 0–26 start. This changed after events surrounding the 1982 players' strike. A report issued by the National Football League Players Association {{prior to the start of}} negotiations revealed that the Buccaneers had the fifth-highest <b>gross</b> <b>income</b> of all NFL teams, while their average salary was only the 21st-highest. This directly contradicted statements made by Culverhouse in 1980, in which he told players that they were on one of the three highest-paid teams. The NFLPA figures showed that the Buccaneers were actually the third lowest-paying team, based on total salaries as a percentage of <b>gross</b> <b>income.</b> Culverhouse was then accused of trying to divide the players during the strike, when some of the team's assistant coaches contacted players to ask whether they would be willing to return to the team should training facilities be reopened.|$|E

His efforts paid off and although trade through the docks only came to 8,000 tons in 1839, they then rose quickly, reaching 827,000 tons by 1849. Between 1841 and 1848 the docks brought in a <b>gross</b> <b>income</b> of just under £68,000, a relatively disappointing figure compared {{to the size of}} the investment.

40|$|Central {{question}} {{in our analysis}} is if voluntarily organised Professions, i. e. self-employed Liberal Professions (Freiberufler) in professional organisations, yield a higher income than those not associated to any professional organisation. To answer this question four waves from the German Socio-Economic Panel Survey Study (GSOEP) are used. Descriptive statistics show a positive link of <b>gross</b> monthly <b>income</b> {{and those who are}} voluntarily associated in professional organisations. Because <b>gross</b> monthly <b>income</b> is influenced by the amount of actual hours worked, <b>gross</b> hourly <b>income</b> is the central magnitude of interest. The aforementioned positive link is widely confirmed by descriptive statistics of corresponding <b>gross</b> hourly <b>income.</b> To measure causal effects through voluntary membership in professional organisations a fixed-effects-model in consideration of unobserved and time constant heterogeneity is estimated. We find a negative premium in <b>gross</b> hourly <b>income</b> for voluntarily organised Professions which varies between - 7, 67 und - 9, 15 %. job satisfaction, flexible working hours, evening and night work, overtime, SOEP...|$|R

5|$|In 1830 Honoré de Balzac {{had only}} begun to achieve {{recognition}} as a writer. Although his parents had persuaded him to make his profession the law, he announced in 1819 {{that he wanted to}} become an author. His mother was distraught, but she and his father agreed to give him a small income, on the condition that he dedicate himself to writing, and deliver to them half of his <b>gross</b> <b>income</b> from any published work. After moving into a tiny room near the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal in Paris, Balzac wrote for one year, without success. Frustrated, he moved back to his family in the suburb of Villeparisis and borrowed money from his parents to pursue his literary ambitions further. He spent the next several years writing simple potboiler novels, which he published under a variety of pseudonyms. He shared some of his income from these with his parents, but by 1828 he still owed them 50,000 francs.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{there were}} few visible changes within the church. Tkach {{continued}} Armstrong's tradition of traveling abroad, although his emphasis was more on visiting church members and operations than on Armstrong's agenda of visiting world leaders to attempt to witness to them. The church entered a period of rapid growth {{during the early years}} of Tkach's administration. In fact, the membership peaked during his tenure at 126,800 members in 1988. The finances were stable, largely due to the church's teaching that members should tithe, giving a tenth of their <b>gross</b> <b>income</b> to the church. The church magazine, The Plain Truth, continued to serialize the final and most controversial book by Armstrong, Mystery of the Ages. Tkach also continued, at least in public, to promote the church's unique doctrines.|$|E
