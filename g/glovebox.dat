50|$|Two styles {{have evolved}} {{in the use of}} <b>gloveboxes</b> for {{synthetic}} chemistry. In a more conservative mode, they are used solely to store, weigh, and transfer air-sensitive reagents. Reactions are thereafter carried out using Schlenk techniques.

25|$|Buick's largest, plushest {{and most}} {{expensive}} models were restyled for 1963, with distinctive rear fenders {{culminating in a}} sharp vertical edge housing narrow back-up lights. The taillights were horizontally placed in the vertical deck cove. A unique cast grille was used at the front. Bright wheelhouse and lower body moldings, with ribbed rear fender panels were used. Red-filled Electra 225 badges {{were found on the}} rear fenders, while four VentiPorts lent status to the front fenders. Interiors were cloth and vinyl combinations, while a Custom interior in vinyl and leather, with front bucket seats and a storage console, was available for the convertible and sport coupe. Standard equipment included directional signals, full-flow oil filter, dual speed electric windshield wiper/washers, Deluxe steering wheel, cigar lighter, Step-On parking brake, dual armrests, Turbine-Drive automatic transmission, padded dashboard, heater, defroster, <b>glovebox</b> light, back-up lights, power steering, Glare-proof rearview mirror, power brakes, parking brake signal light, safety buzzer, courtesy lights, two-way power seats, power windows, Super Deluxe wheelcovers, Safety option group, custom padded cushions, Accessory Group options and custom moldings. Buick dropped the Riviera name as a body style designation after the 1963 model year, shifting the Riviera name exclusively to Buick's new personal luxury coupe that had been introduced in 1963. Buick added a 7-way tilt steering wheel and a new cruise control as an option.|$|E
25|$|The 1978 {{model year}} VAM Pacers gained new hood and grille designs, which in Mexico {{were just a}} {{facelift}} {{due to the lack}} of a V8 engine. The only technical difference of the year was the replacement of the Holley 2300 carburetor in favor of a Motorcraft 2150 unit with a built-in altitude compensator despite having a slightly lower flow. This took away a small amount of power but allowed easier passing of emission certification and was more reliable in changing altitudes. New standard features included a hood light, a speedometer in both kilometers and miles per hour, door panels including a vertical stripe pattern over their top edges, a different AM/FM radio model, a new flat-faced luxury steering wheel design with an AMC logo, and new seat designs. The heater was improved in the form of air vents appearing to the left of the instrument cluster, the center of the dashboard above the ashtray and over the top right corner of the <b>glovebox</b> door regardless of the presence of the air conditioning system. The heater controls were revised, obtaining the VENT option in airflow selection, which was now a sliding lever instead of the five buttons used in the prior two years. The two remaining air vents, the passenger's side one over the top left corner of the glove box door and driver's side one integrated to the cover under the steering column, could only be obtained with the A/C system.|$|E

2500|$|The 1974 models brought further modifications. [...] A 1.6l engine {{producing}} 44 HP SAE (50 PS DIN) {{replaced the}} previous 1.5l. The front fenders were enlarged, new front turn signals (identical {{to the ones}} on American spec Beetles) were added, and round, enlarged taillights were introduced, one year after their appearance on German Beetles (except the 1973 VW 1200). The engine cover remained unchanged, except it no longer had an emblem. Inside, the front seats were re-designed, and the interior colour was changed from gray to black. Also, the front hood release lever was relocated inside the <b>glovebox,</b> as on 1969 and later German Beetles.|$|E
40|$|At the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS), the D&D task is enormous. Tons of {{plutonium}} has been processed {{over the years}} in approximately 1, 000 <b>gloveboxes,</b> This represents nearly half of the <b>gloveboxes</b> in the DOE complex. In addition, more than a thousand tanks of various designs, with miles of associated piping, supported the processes. A wide variety of operations were performed at RFETS, including aqueous processing, pyrophoric processing, hydriding and dehydriding, metal casting, and machining {{of plutonium}}. Various materials have been handled at the facility, including plutonium, uranium, americium, tantalum, beryllium, chloride salts, and various acids and solvents. Significant amounts of plutonium residues remain in inaccessible equipment in the facilities, which create criticality safety issues. Some of the plutonium has been at RFETS for many years, and there is significant in-growth of americium, a decay product that emits gamma radiation, which potentially increases exposure to the workers. The size reduction portion of the D&D will be difficult and costly. The <b>gloveboxes</b> and tanks are constructed of stainless steel, frequently with lead shielding or double walls that hold water for neutron shielding. Window mountings, glove port rings, site gages, bolted flanges, and various penetrations reinforce the walls. Tanks may be filled with berated glass rings for criticality control, or double walled to hold the process fluid in the space between walls. The <b>gloveboxes</b> and tanks are generally tall enough to require workers to stand on scaffolding or platforms to perform D&D. <b>Gloveboxes</b> and tanks were individually constructed over a span of many years with evolving design specifications; therefore, most <b>gloveboxes</b> are unique and few tank designs are duplicated in more than pairs. This paper describes the cultural transition and technical approaches taken for D&D at RFETS to achieve 2006 closure. Specific emphasis is placed on critical issues such as, workforce safety and retention, strategies for schedule acceleration, and technological breakthroughs for D&D of nuclear facilities...|$|R

One of the challenges faced for closure is the disposition of radiologically contaminated <b>gloveboxes.</b> Evaluation of the disposition options for <b>gloveboxes</b> included {{a detailed analysis of}} available treatment capabilities, disposal facilities, and lifecycle costs.

Several challenges associated with developing a disposition path that addresses both the radiological and RCRA concerns as well as offering the most cost-effective solution were encountered. These challenges included meeting the radiological waste acceptance criteria of available disposal facilities, making a RCRA determination, evaluating treatment options and costs, addressing void requirements associated with disposal, and identifying packaging and transportation options. The varying disposal facility requirements affected disposition choices. Facility conditions that impacted decisions included radiological and chemical waste acceptance criteria, physical requirements, and measurement for payment options.
