40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The need for a product model which can support the modelling requirements of {{a broad range of}} applications leads to the application of a feature-based model. An important requirement in feature-based design and manufacture is that a single feature representation should be capable of supporting a number of different applications. The capability of representing products composed of assemblies is seen to be necessary to serve the information needs of those applications. To achieve this aim it is an essential prerequisite to develop a formal structure for the representation of assembly information in a feature-based design system. This research addresses two basic questions related to the lack of a unified definition for features and the problem of representing assemblies in a feature-based representation. The intention is to extend the concept of designing with features by incorporating assembly information in addition to the geometrical and topological details of component parts. This allows models to be assembled using the assembly information within the feature definitions. Features in this research are defined as machined volumes which are represented in a hierarchical taxonomy. The taxonomy includes several types and profiles of features which cover a general range of machined parts. A hierarchical assembly structure is also defined in which features form basic entities in the assembly. Each feature includes information needed to establish assembly relationships among features in the form of mating relationships. An analysis of typical assemblies shows that assembly interfaces occur at the face level of the mating features and between features themselves. Three mating relationships between pairs of features have been defined (against, fits and align) and are represented in the form of expressions {{that can be used for}} evaluations. Various sub-types of these major mating relationships can be identified (e. g. tight <b>fit,</b> <b>clearance</b> fit, etc.) and represented through the use of qualifying attributes. Component Relation Graphs, Feature Relation Graphs and Face Mating Graphs have been developed to represent each level of interaction in an assembly, and assembly relationships are combined with knowledge on process planning into a Component Connectivity Graph. These graphs are used as the basis for deriving an integrated data structure which is used for defining classes for each level in the assembly hierarchy. The implementation of a prototype system has been facilitated by use of an object-oriented programming technique which provides a natural method of adding functionality to the geometric reasoning process of features and the complex relationships between the parts that make up the assembly. The feature-based model is embedded in an object-oriented solid modeller kernel, ACIS®. The research demonstrates the possibilities for a single feature representation to support multiple activities within a computer integrated manufacturing environment. Such a representation can form the basis of design improvement techniques and manufacturing planning as well as be a model to support the life cycle of the product...|$|E

40|$|The plane {{problem of}} load {{transfer}} from an elastic interference or <b>clearance</b> <b>fit</b> pin {{to a large}} elastic sheet with a perfectly smooth interface is solved. As the load on the pin is monotonically increased, the pin-hole interface is in partial contact above certain critical load in interference fit and throughout the loading range in <b>clearance</b> <b>fit.</b> Such situations result in mixed boundary-value problems with moving boundaries and the arc of contact varies nonlinearly with applied load. These problems are analyzed by an inverse technique in which the arcs of contact/separation are prescribed and the causative loads are evaluated. A direct method of analysis is adopted using biharmonic polar trigonometric stress functions and a simple collocation method for satisfying the boundary conditions.

40|$|Fatigue {{tests have}} been {{conducted}} on single-pinned and double-pinned lugs made from alloy steel FV 520 B and loaded by means of 2 in diameter pins. The effects of pin <b>fit</b> for both <b>clearance</b> and interference and of various treatments were investigated. The treatments included side relieving the lug hole, bushing the bore, applying the Sulhuz process to the lug or overstraining the lug bore. Two conditions of mean stress were investigated, namely, pulsating or repeated tension and 15 tons/ina mean tension. Basing comparison on the fatigue strength at 30 x lo 8 cycles, the untreated lugs with close fit pins showed the lowest strength of all. Both <b>clearance</b> and interference <b>fits</b> were beneficial and by appropriate choice, the fatigue strength could be at least doubled {{and in some cases}} trebled. Lugs which had side relief, had been bushed, Sulfinuz treated or which had oversuained bores also gave worthwhile increases in fatigue strength and the strength ratios were generally in excess of 2. An increase in mean stress significantly reduced fatigue strength for all lugs tested, except for those with close <b>fit</b> or <b>clearance</b> <b>fit</b> pins.

40|$|Effects of {{fastener}} <b>clearance</b> <b>fit,</b> friction coefficient, and corrosion pillowing on {{the stress}} state in triple-row riveted lap joints were studied numerically using three-dimensional finite element methods. The material elastoplastic constitutive relationship and geometric nonlinear properties, {{as well as}} nonlinear contact boundary conditions, {{were included in the}} numerical simulations. The numerical modeling was validated using experimental measurements of the rivet driven head deformation and in-situ strains. The lap joints were loaded in tension after riveting. Three different <b>clearance</b> <b>fits,</b> three different friction coefficients, and four corrosion pillowing conditions were analyzed. The stress variation along prescribed paths during the tensile loading stage is discussed for each of these conditions. Full-field contours of the friction and maximum principal stresses during the tensile loading stage were investigated. Numerical results showed that a small increase in the <b>clearance</b> <b>fit</b> considerably increased the joint stress magnitude. The <b>clearance</b> <b>fit</b> magnitude also affected the maximum stress location in the vicinity at the top fastener hole. A large friction coefficient increased the contact and friction stresses in the hole vicinity. These results could explain the scatter degree of the fatigue data and could be used to improve the manufacture quality for high fatigue-rated riveted lap joints. Serious corrosion pillowing significantly increased the stress magnitude at both the middle and top hole regions, and led to the co-existence of the two highly-stressed areas in the outer sheet, which greatly decreased the integrity of the aged riveted lap joint due to the occurrence of the multiple-sited damages during cyclic loading.

40|$|Polygonal shafts {{are a major}} {{competitor}} {{to spline}} and keyed shafts for power transmission due to features as self-centering, lack of stress concentration area, and ease of assembly and disassembly. Past studies on polygonal profiles have focused on a single profile and comparisons based on nominal sizes of three and four lobe profiles. This research explores the loading strength of the standardized three and four lobe polygonal shafts and hubs manufactured from the same stock size, subjected to pure torsional and torsional bending load from a spur gear of 20 ° pressure angle at various fits. In absence of analytical solution, Finite element method has been used after verifying the results experimentally, theoretically, and DIN standard. From the finite element analysis, the hub was found to experience greater stress than the shaft in all cases. The <b>clearance</b> <b>fit</b> {{was found to be}} the most critical connection and interference fit to be the most suitable for larger power transmission. The P 4 C connection had greater stress, especially in the hub, than the P 3 G connection. The difference between the P 4 C shaft and the P 3 G shaft was 4. 05 % in the interference fit and 60. 6 % in the <b>clearance</b> <b>fit,</b> suggesting P 4 C <b>clearance</b> <b>fit</b> to be less favorable for larger power transmission. Owing to its small normal axial stress, the P 4 C <b>clearance</b> <b>fit</b> has its use in low power transmission where sliding fit is a requirement. The reason for greater stress in P 4 C shaft and hub connection is due to the large pressure angle at the point of contact, which leads to a smaller contact area and greater contact pressure.

Triacylglycerol-rich lipid emulsions labelled with tracer amounts of radioactive triolein and cholesteryl oleate were prepared by sonication and purified by density gradient ultracentrifugation, then injected into unanaesthetized rats and normal human subjects. Plasma radioactivities were measured for 30 min in rats and 90 min in human subjects. Rat lymph chylomicrons were also injected into rats for comparison with the clearance of the lipid emulsions.

Three embedded strain gauge models were manufactured to measure strains due to contact at multiple angular locations around the bolt hole and multiple depths through the lug. Strains were measured in three orthogonal directions for loading by a steel pin. Three fits of pin were considered representing a neat-fit and two clearances (0. 17 % and 0. 5 % of hole diameter). Testing was performed for lubricated and unlubricated contact conditions {{to examine the effects of}} friction A gradient in stress was found through the model thickness for the loading cases considered. A smaller bearing stress was present at the outer surfaces than on the lug midplane. Similarly, the maximum tensile hoop stress was diminished at the outer surface. The difference between the surface and internal strains was up to 25 % and was most extreme for the case of loading by a clearance-fitting pin. The exact level of pin clearance was not important in the hoop stress case. The experimental measurement of outer surface behaviour may therefore not be representative of internal stress concentrations and the use of a plane stress finite element model may lead to over-simplifications for a thick lug. The effect of friction was to reduce the bearing stress at the centre of the contact, though this effect was diminished at the lug ligament at the edge of the contact arc. A history-dependency was found for the dry friction case where the strains during unloading did not match the corresponding strains during loading. The difference between these values reached 27 %. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the loading history in such a lug rather than just the load level of interest.
