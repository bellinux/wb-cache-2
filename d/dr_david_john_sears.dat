The report recommendations, fundamental changes nature of funding of the program from an annual cycle to a 10 year committed funding program.

50|$|In April 2001 a headstone for Tommy Johnson was {{commissioned}} by {{members of his family}} and paid for by a grant from Bonnie Raitt. On October 20, 2001 the unveiling ceremony was conducted in the town square of Crystal Springs, Mississippi by the Mayor of Crystal Springs with over twenty members of Johnson's extended family in attendance as well as Johnson's biographer <b>Dr.</b> <b>David</b> Evans, <b>John</b> Sinclair and a contingent of people from radio station WWOZ in New Orleans, many local musicians, blues fans, and local media. The large granite memorial, engraved with Johnson's portrait, was not placed on his grave for several years afterward, however, because of a dispute between Johnson's family (led by his niece, Vera Johnson Collins), the owners of farm property encircling the cemetery, and the Copiah County Board of Supervisors over a deteriorated road to the burial site. The dispute was resolved in October 2012, when it was announced that the headstone would be erected on October 26. The headstone had been on public display in the Crystal Springs Public Library since being unveiled on October 20, 2001. On the night of Saturday, February 2, 2013, the headstone fell and was damaged. It is a matter of dispute whether it fell because it was inadequately secured, or was pushed over or deliberately smashed.|$|R
