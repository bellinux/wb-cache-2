40|$|Internal {{friction}} {{behavior of}} hydrogen in vanadium-niobium alloys containing from 40 at. pct. niobium to 100 at. pct. niobium {{as a function}} of hydrogen concentration was investigated. The internal friction measurements were performed in an electrostatic drive and <b>detection</b> <b>apparatus</b> <b>for</b> rods in flexural vibration in the temperature range from 30 °K to 290 °K;An internal friction peak due to hydrogen was found in all the vanadium-niobium alloys. The peak was considered to be due to the jumps of hydrogen atoms in solid solution. The peak moved toward lower temperatures with increasing hydrogen concentration. In other words, the activation energies of the hydrogen motion responsible for the internal friction peaks decreased with increasing hydrogen concentration. The activation energies increased with increasing niobium concentration up to 75 at. pct. niobium then decreased. The peaks were broader than expected for single Debye peaks. The broad peaks were considered to be due to superposition of many single Debye peaks with different activation energies and the distribution of activation energies were estimated by the Direct Spectrum Analysis. The activation energies and [tau][subscript] o values for the hydrogen internal friction processes obtained from the present study were compared to those obtained from long range diffusion experiments;In order to examine the isotope effect, internal friction of deuterium in the same alloys were measured and compared to those of hydrogen.

5000|$|The {{first floor}} of the two-story Beaux Arts-style {{building}} was a post office and the second floor was devoted to the activities of the U.S. Bureau of Mines and a local mine rescue organization serving the coal mining region around Jellico. Mine rescue stations were outfitted with equipment needed to respond to underground mining accidents and served as sites for conducting training of local mining personnel. Congressman Richard Wilson Austin, who represented the area in the U.S. House of Representatives, was credited with obtaining authorization for the building's construction, which cost about $80,000 (equivalent to about $ today). Design of the building was by the Office of the Supervising Architect; design work was started by James Knox Taylor and completed by Oscar Wenderoth. It was built in 1915 and dedicated the following year. The building was considered to be unusually fine for a small town like Jellico. A contemporary account suggested that it might be characterized as [...] "government pork". The facilities for the Bureau of Mines were described as the [...] "best ... hitherto given to this organization". In addition to offices, a lecture hall, and electrical connections for a [...] "motion-picture machine", these facilities included a smoke room, equipped with an exhaust fan, which was used in training miners in the use of breathing <b>apparatus</b> <b>for</b> <b>mine</b> rescues.|$|R
40|$|Thanks to {{the large}} {{diffusion}} of small wearable devices there are several systems designed for indoor localization. Among the proposed solutions, RF-based systems have been deeply investigated due to their flexibility and limited costs. When these systems are employed as assistive tools, they should be dependable, recognizing autonomously when they are affected by a fault. In this paper, we present a method to provide multiuser localization with concurrent fault detection. We focus on two possible sources of faults: natural hardware (e. g., empty battery, faulty components) and human-made (e. g., device not worn). The presented methodology relies on two independent measurement systems and on a model based fault <b>detection</b> <b>apparatus,</b> checking <b>for</b> discrepancies {{in the behavior of}} the subsystems. This method is implemented to provide dependable localization in fragile people (such as elderly or people with small impairments) dwellings.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of anti-IgG antibodies (rheumatoid factors, RF) in body fluids (sera, synovial fluids and aqueous humor) selected from 62 normal and 275 diseased dogs was studied. Fluids were assayed by canine versions of standard agglutinating and/or precipitating RF assays with routine application in human practice. The number of RF detected by dog IgG-coated particles was substantially higher by {{latex fixation test}} (LFT) than by modified Rose-Waaler (RW) test (61 / 144 vs. 14 / 144). This did not result from false positives by LFT since latex activity was completely inhibited by aggregated dog IgG. Some evidence is presented indicating that results obtained by standard RW in particular, but also those obtained by standard LFT, might be improved by modifying testing conditions currently used. Body fluids were further studied {{for the presence of}} precipitins to aggregated dog IgG in 0. 6 % agarose (gel precipitation test (GPT)). The frequency of RF was higher by GPT than by LFT, both in normal control fluids (for sera 26 / 52 vs. 19 / 52) and patient material (for sera 135 / 197 vs. 95 / 197). Thus, the canine RF appear to be a serum component with an unexpectedly high frequency in both normal and diseased dogs, but grossly underestimated by the recommended routine RF assays based on agglutination. The GPT, which combines a superior detection rate of theoretically also agglutinating RF with an inability to detect RF quantitatively, seems an ideal RF ‘indicator’ test to dictate improvements to the quantitative LFT/RW assays so as to facilitate RF detection at clinically relevant concentrations. Thus optimized, RW/LFT would provide the optimal <b>detection</b> <b>apparatus</b> <b>for</b> the ultimate isolation of the relevant ‘RF’ repertoire present, for comparative studies aimed ultimately at unraveling the etiopathogenesis of the ‘real’ RF...|$|R

40|$|Two {{methods for}} the {{determination}} of hexahydrophthalic anhydride (HHPA) in air were developed. In a solid sorbent method, HHPA was sampled in Amberlite XAD- 2 tubes, eluted in toluene and analysed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. The sampling rates were 0. 2 and 1. 0 l/min. At 15 micrograms/m 3 (relative humidity less than 2 %) and 27 micrograms/m 3 (relative humidity 70 %) no breakthrough was observed. However, at 160 micrograms/m 3 (relative humidity less than 2 %), 6 % breakthrough was found. The sampling efficiency of the sampling rates 0. 2 and 1. 0 l/min did not differ. In a bubbler method, HHPA was sampled in bubblers filled with 0. 1 M sodium hydroxide solution. The sodium salt of hexahydrophthalic acid was formed. No breakthrough was observed using a sampling rate of 1. 0 l/min. The samples were stable during storage for eight weeks in a refrigerator. The HHP acid was esterified with methanol-boron trifluoride and analysed by gas chromatography-flame ionization <b>detection.</b> <b>Apparatus</b> <b>for</b> the generation of standard atmospheres of HHPA, {{in the range of}} 10 - 3000 micrograms/m 3, was developed using the diffusion principle. For the solid sorbent method the precision (coefficient of variation) of the overall method was 2 - 7 %, and for the bubbler method 3 - 19 % (range 15 - 160 micrograms HHPA/m 3; relative humidity = less than 2 - 70 %). A comparison between the two methods was performed using the standard atmosphere. The concentrations found by the solid sorbent method were 86 - 98 % of those found by the bubbler method (range 15 - 160 micrograms HHPA per m 3; relative humidity = less than 2 - 70 %). In work environment air, 93 % was found using the solid sorbent method relative to the bubbler method at a mean concentration of 330 micrograms/m 3 (coefficient of variation = 39 %; range 200 - 540 micrograms/m 3). For both methods, concentrations greater than 3 micrograms/m 3 could be quantified at 60 min sampling with a sampling rate of 1. 0 l/min...|$|R

40|$|In time-domain {{measurements}} of a Poisson two-level system, the observed transition rates are always smaller {{than those of}} the actual system, a general consequence of finite measurement bandwidth in an experiment.
