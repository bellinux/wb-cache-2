2500|$|In {{response}} to mainland China's {{purchase of the}} Su-27, the Republic of China (Taiwan) entered into talks with the US and France about the possible purchase of new fighters. While the US would oppose Taiwan's acquisition of the Mirage 2000 and instead pressure it to procure the F-16, in November 1992, the [...] Republic of China Air Force became the first customer for the Mirage 2000-5. The order, which attracted the condemnation of China, purchased 48 single-seat Mirage 2000-5EIs and 12 Mirage 2000-5DI trainers. The deal for the 60 aircraft was accompanied by the purchase of 480 Magic short-range air-to-air missiles, 960 MICA intermediate-range air-to-air missiles, auxiliary fuel tanks, ground support equipment, and monitoring equipment; total costs amounted to US$4.9 billion, of which $2.6 billion was for the aircraft. The MICA missile provides the Mirage {{with a degree of}} BVR capability needed for its role as front-line interceptor. In addition, a set of ASTAC electronic intelligence (ELINT) pods was ordered. A number of centerline twin gun pods with DEFA 554 cannons were also acquired and fitted on the two-seaters, as they do not have an <b>internal</b> <b>gun</b> armament.|$|E

There are also shot-to-shot variations due to barrel temperature and interference between guns firing simultaneously.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{innovative}} technologies {{introduced in}} fourth-generation fighters include pulse-Doppler fire-control radars (providing a [...] "look-down/shoot-down" [...] capability), head-up displays (HUD), [...] "hands on throttle-and-stick" [...] (HOTAS) controls, and multi-function displays (MFD), all now essential equipment. Aircraft designers began to incorporate composite {{materials in the}} form of bonded aluminum honeycomb structural elements and graphite epoxy laminate skins to reduce weight. Infrared search-and-track (IRST) sensors became widespread for air-to-ground weapons delivery, and appeared for air-to-air combat as well. [...] "All-aspect" [...] IR AAM became standard air superiority weapons, which permitted engagement of enemy aircraft from any angle (although the field of view remained relatively limited). The first long-range active-radar-homing RF AAM entered service with the AIM-54 Phoenix, which solely equipped the Grumman F-14 Tomcat, one of the few variable-sweep-wing fighter designs to enter production. Even with the tremendous advancement of air-to-air missiles in this era, <b>internal</b> <b>guns</b> were standard equipment.|$|R
25|$|The F-102 {{received}} several major modifications during its operational lifetime, with most airframes being retrofitted with infrared search/tracking systems, radar warning receivers, transponders, backup artificial horizons, and {{improvements to the}} fire control system.

50|$|In 1959, he was {{assigned}} to the Navy War College, and after graduation, was stationed at Headquarters United States Air Force in the Directorate of Operations. While in that posting he {{played a major role in}} convincing the leadership in the Air Force the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II needed to be equipped with a gun. This led first to the installation of the gun pod, and later an <b>internal</b> <b>gun,</b> which was first introduced in the F-4E model.|$|E
50|$|The F-4E, {{the most}} {{advanced}} Phantom variant with extensive ground-attack capabilities and an <b>internal</b> <b>gun,</b> {{became the basis for}} the F-4G Wild Weasel V (also known as the Advanced Wild Weasel). This modification consisted of removing the gun and replacing it with the APR-38(t) Radar Homing and Warning Receiver (later upgraded to the APR-47), and a cockpit upgrade for the back seat to manage the electronic combat environment. A total of 134 F-4G models were converted from F-4Es with the first one flying in 1975. Squadron service began in 1978.|$|E
50|$|The USAF had deemphasized ACM {{since most}} air combat {{doctrine}} {{since the late}} 1950s centered on delivering nuclear weapons over Europe or firing missiles at beyond-visual-range (BVR) at bombers, not daylight dogfighting which {{was thought to be}} obsolete in the missile age. The primary US fighter used against North Vietnamese MiGs, the F-4 Phantom, did not even have an <b>internal</b> <b>gun.</b> US pilots were finding themselves hard-pressed to prevail over the nimble VPAF MiGs which by late 1966 had grown to be a real threat to US aircraft operating over the North.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Internal</b> mixing <b>guns</b> have {{a chamber}} {{where the water}} and air are mixed {{together}} and forced through jets or through holes and {{fall to the ground}} as snow. These guns are typically low to the ground on a frame or tripod and require a lot of air to compensate for the short hang time (time the water is airborne). Some newer guns are built in a tower form and use much less air because of the increased hang time. The amount of water flow determines the type of snow that is to be made and is controlled by an adjustable water valve.|$|R

Several larger aircraft were outfitted with miniguns specifically for close air support: the Cessna A-37 Dragonfly with an <b>internal</b> <b>gun</b> and with pods on wing hardpoints; and the Douglas A-1 Skyraider, also with pods on wing hardpoints. Other famous gunship airplanes were the Douglas AC-47 Spooky, the Fairchild AC-119, and the Lockheed AC-130.|$|E

50|$|The F-14's {{fuselage}} {{and wings}} {{allow it to}} climb faster than the F-4, while the twin-tail arrangement offers better stability. The F-14 is equipped with an internal 20 mm M61 Vulcan Gatling cannon mounted {{on the left side}} (unlike the Phantom, which was not equipped with an <b>internal</b> <b>gun</b> in the US Navy), and can carry AIM-54 Phoenix, AIM-7 Sparrow, and AIM-9 Sidewinder anti-aircraft missiles. The twin engines are housed in widely spaced nacelles. The flat area of the fuselage between the nacelles is used to contain fuel and avionics systems, such as the wing-sweep mechanism and flight controls, as well as weaponry since the wings were not used for carrying ordnance. By itself, the fuselage provides approximately 40 to 60 percent of the F-14's aerodynamic lifting surface depending on the wing sweep position. The lifting body characteristics of the fuselage allowed one F-14 to safely land after suffering a mid-air collision that sheared off {{more than half of the}} plane's right wing in 1991.|$|E

25|$|With the {{formation}} of NATO, French interest in a renewed fortification system against a Warsaw Pact invasion caused the renovation {{of most of the}} larger Maginot fortifications by the 1950s. Hochwald joined Schoenenbourg, Four-à-Chaux and Lembach in a system called the Môle de Haguenau, with work at Hochwald proceeding in 1952 to repair the war damage. However, in 1956, Hochwald was transferred to the French Air Force for use as an air defense command center. New underground galleries were built in the rear (i.e., near the entrance blocks), and were even provided with an <b>internal</b> machine <b>gun</b> port. The facility was briefly known as Ouvrage H before its designation as Base Aérienne 901 Drachenbronn.|$|R
50|$|Also, {{quality of}} the {{individual}} pellets may influence choice of price-range or manufacturer. Low-cost pellets are often considered to have such negative characteristics as residual plastic from the moulding process (flash); lower impact resistance and some deviation from perfect spherical shape. Cheaper pellets are known to shatter when fired, which can cause irreparable damage to the <b>internals</b> of the <b>gun.</b> Higher cost BBs generally have a smoother finish, are more impact resistant and are perfectly spherical.|$|R

5000|$|The AIM-7 Sparrow medium range missile (MRM) was {{purchased}} by the US Navy from original developer Howard Hughes in the 1950s as its first operational air-to-air missile with [...] "beyond visual range" [...] (BVR) capability. With an effective range of about 12 mi, it was introduced as a radar beam-riding missile {{and then it was}} improved to a semiactive radar guided missile which would home in on reflections from a target illuminated by the radar of the launching aircraft. It was effective at visual to beyond visual range. The early beam riding versions of the Sparrow missiles were integrated onto the F3H Demon and F7U Cutlass, but the definitive AIM-7 Sparrow was the primary weapon for the all-weather F-4 Phantom II fighter/interceptor, which lacked an <b>internal</b> <b>gun</b> in its U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and early U.S. Air Force versions.

50|$|During {{the years}} 1942 and 1943 the StuG {{was one of}} the most {{effective}} tracked vehicles of World War II, as shown in terms of opposition vehicles destroyed. Over 10,000 StuGs were eventually produced. The inability to traverse the gun at times became a significant weakness, and the lack of an <b>internal</b> light machine <b>gun</b> in the initial models left the StuG vulnerable to close-range infantry attack. A machine gun and shield were added to later versions.|$|R
50|$|In {{the troubled}} years {{immediately}} before World War I, arms manufacturing increased {{significantly in the}} UK, but practical problems were encountered due to erosion (excessive wear) of the <b>internal</b> surfaces of <b>gun</b> barrels. Brearley began to research new steels which could better resist the erosion caused by high temperatures (rather than corrosion, as is often mentioned in this regard). He began to examine the addition of chromium to steel, which was known to raise the material’s melting point, {{as compared to the}} standard carbon steels.|$|R
50|$|Air {{operated}} piston type supply pumps can put {{out as much}} as 27 gpm. Like the Graco Bulldog 10:1 {{at about}} 9 gpm and the Lincoln Pile driver 5:1 at about 27 gpm. These flow-rates are calculated at a maximum of 120 cfm air supply. Material supply hoses are medium pressure at about 600 psi. These pumps are material supply pumps only and additional air is required at the spray gun to propel the material to the surface. These guns are usually an <b>internal</b> mixture type <b>guns</b> where the material and air exits the gun together.|$|R
5000|$|... 4. Weapon systems effectiveness. This area is {{one where}} the light fighter can be at a disadvantage, since the combat load of a single engine light fighter is {{typically}} about half of a twin engine heavy fighter. However, modern single engine light fighters such as the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and the Saab JAS 39 Gripen generally carry similar cannon and air-to-air missile fighter weapons as heavier fighters. Actual aerial combat {{in the modern era}} is of short duration, typically about two minutes, and as {{only a small fraction of}} this is spent actually firing, modest weapons load outs are generally effective. The ideal weapons load for a modern fighter is considered to be an <b>internal</b> <b>gun</b> and two to four guided missiles, a load that modern light fighters are fully capable of while maintaining high agility. For example, the JAS 39 Gripen, despite being the lightest major fighter in current production, carries a combat load of an 27mm cannon and up to six air-to-air missiles of the same types as carried by heavy fighters. Additionally, combat experience shows that weapons systems [...] "effectiveness" [...] has not been dominated by the amount of weaponry or [...] "load out", but by the ability to achieve split second kills when in position to do so.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first is}} the F-35A, a {{conventional}} takeoff and landing (CTOL) variant. It is the smallest and lightest version, and is intended primarily to replace the U.S. Air Force's aging F-16 Fighting Falcons and A-10 Thunderbolt IIs. This is the only version with an <b>internal</b> <b>gun,</b> the GAU-22. This 25 mm cannon is an upgrade from the 20 mm M61 Vulcan carried by USAF fighters since the F-104 Starfighter. Deliveries were scheduled to begin in 2011. The F-35B is the short-takeoff and vertical-landing (STOVL) variant due to replace the U.S. Marine Corps AV-8 Harrier IIs and F/A-18 Hornets, and Royal Air Force/Royal Navy Harrier GR7/GR9s beginning in 2012. The Royal Navy will use this to replace its Harrier GR7s and the RAF replace its Harrier GR9s. The U.S. Marine Corps will use the F-35B to replace both its AV-8B Harrier IIs and F/A-18 Hornets with a design similar in size to the Air Force F-35A, trading fuel volume for vertical flight systems. Like the Harrier, guns will be carried in a pod. Vertical flight {{is by far the}} riskiest, and in the end, a decisive factor in design. Lastly, the F-35C, a carrier-based variant, will replace the [...] "legacy" [...] F/A-18 Hornets and serve as a stealthy complement to the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. It will have a larger, folding wing and larger control surfaces for improved low-speed control, and stronger landing gear for the stresses of carrier landings. The larger wing area provides increased range and payload, achieving much the same goal as the much heavier Super Hornet. The U.S. Navy plans to purchase 480 JSF, with deliveries scheduled to start in 2012.|$|E
5000|$|After {{manufacturing}} 35 {{tanks of}} the A version, in 1937 production {{moved to the}} Ausf. B. Improvements included {{the replacement of the}} original engine with the more powerful [...] Maybach HL 120TR, and the transmission with the new SSG 75 transmission, with six forward gears and one reverse gear. Despite a weight increase to 16 t, this improved the tank's speed to 42 km/h. The glacis plate was augmented to a maximum thickness of 30 mm, while a new driver's visor was installed on the straightened hull front plate, and the hull-mounted machine gun was replaced by a covered pistol port and visor flap. The superstructure width and ammunition stowage were reduced to save weight. A new commander's cupola was introduced which was adopted from the Panzer III Ausf. C. A Nebelkerzenabwurfvorrichtung (smoke grenade discharger rack) was mounted on the rear of the hull starting in July 1938 and was back fitted to earlier Ausf. A and Ausf. B chassis starting in August 1938. Forty-two Panzer IV Ausf. Bs were manufactured before the introduction of the Ausf. C in 1938. This saw the turret armor increased to 30 mm, which brought the tank's weight to 18.14 t. After assembling 40 Ausf. Cs, starting with chassis number 80341, the engine was replaced with the improved HL 120TRM. The last of the 140 Ausf. Cs was produced in August 1939, and production changed to the Ausf. D; this variant, of which 248 vehicles were produced, reintroduced the hull machine gun and changed the turret's <b>internal</b> <b>gun</b> mantlet to a 35 mm thick external mantlet. Again, protection was upgraded, this time by increasing side armor to 20 mm. As the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 came to an end, it was decided to scale up production of the Panzer IV, which was adopted for general use on 27 September 1939 as the Sonderkraftfahrzeug 161 (Sd.Kfz. 161).|$|E
50|$|The F-102 {{received}} several major modifications during its operational lifetime, with most airframes being retrofitted with infrared search/tracking systems, radar warning receivers, transponders, backup artificial horizons, and {{improvements to the}} fire control system.

The aircraft was designed with side-by-side seating to facilitate pilot training, a popular concept in the 1950s (also used with the American Cessna T-37, British Hawker Hunter T.7 and English Electric Lightning T.4, among others). This required a redesign of the cockpit and nose incorporating a set of vortex generators {{on the top of}} the cockpit to prevent flow separation under certain circumstances, and repositioning of the intake ducts. Despite the many changes, the aircraft was combat-capable, although this variant was predictably slower, reaching only subsonic speeds in level flight.|$|R
50|$|The Sunderland {{was usually}} entered through the bow {{compartment}} {{door on the}} left forward side of the aircraft. The <b>internal</b> compartments—bow, <b>gun</b> room, ward room, galley, bomb room and the after compartments—were fitted with swash doors to keep them watertight to about two feet (610 mm) above normal water level. These doors were normally kept closed. There was another external door in the tail compartment on the right side. This door was intended for boarding from a Braby (U-shaped) pontoon that was used {{where there was a}} full passenger service mooring alongside a wharf or similar. This door could also be used to accept passengers or stretcher-bound patients when the aircraft was in the open water. This was because the engines had to be kept running to maintain the aircraft's position for the approaching vessel and the front door was too close to the left inboard propeller. Normal access to the external upper parts of the aircraft was through the astrodome hatch {{at the front of the}} front spar of the wing centre section, just at the rear of the navigator's station.|$|R
50|$|As {{with many}} inventions {{there is an}} element of luck in the finding of a new type of steel and it is just so with {{stainless}} steel. With the coming together of Firth and Brown to build a joint research facility (Brown Firth Laboratories) in 1908, a project was instigated to study one of the problems affecting armaments production. In charge of this was Harry Brearley. The problem concerned the erosion of the <b>internal</b> surfaces of <b>gun</b> barrels and Brearley was charged with finding a suitable material which would offer better resistance to the erosion caused by high temperatures and he began to examine the addition of chromium to a standard carbon steel.|$|R
