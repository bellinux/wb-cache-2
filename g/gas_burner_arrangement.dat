40|$|Abstract: The {{characteristics}} of the combustion temperature, flow velocity, CO distribution and NOx emissions of a 10 MW <b>gas</b> <b>burner</b> at different primary to secondary air ratios are numerically studied using computational fluid dynamics software Fluent. The {{results indicate that the}} primary to secondary air ratio in <b>gas</b> <b>burner</b> determines the combustion quality through influencing some parameters directly, such as the combustion efficiency, combustion intensity, profile and stability of flame as well as emission of NOx. Then two evaluation indexes of combustion quality are summarized after analyzing the flame structure and {{characteristics of}} the flow. The detailed results reported in this paper may provide a useful basis for NOx reduction and premixed <b>gas</b> <b>burner</b> design. Finally some proposals are given to choose the optimal primary to secondary air ratio for a <b>gas</b> <b>burner...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to study the promotion combustion efficiency of the domestic <b>gas</b> <b>burner</b> with various <b>gas</b> <b>burner,</b> height of frame, first air, nozzle diameter, and gas pressure. The production quantity of nature gas is offered with shortage in Taiwan. The phenomenon had not been shown until 1990 {{due to the fact that}} our country import liquefied natura 1 gas from abroad. The natural gas powerhouse, compressed natural gas car, LNG cold energy utilization and LNG air-conditioning, etc. are therefore needed to develop so that a higher technology level and perversive environment could be achieved. Relevant definitions for the fundamental theory in combustion and burner design for domestic natural gas appliances also needs to making. This paper studies the fundamental aspects of the four main components of the Bunser burner, such as the injector, air entrainment, mixing tube design, and burner port geometry. The experiment results are shown that the LPG and NG <b>gas</b> <b>burner</b> can converse to LNG <b>gas</b> <b>burner</b> when the inner ring is 0. 7 0. 9 mm and the outer ring is 1. 7 1. 9 mm. The effect of the height of <b>gas</b> <b>burner</b> frame with combustion efficiency is very strong. The optimum of the height of <b>gas</b> <b>burner</b> frame are 2. 0 3. 5 cm and 3. 0 4. 5 cm for small and large type pot respectively. The maximum input heat of the domestic <b>gas</b> <b>burner</b> is optimum when the value is 0. 40 0. 50 m□/hr. The gas pressure should be adapted to 150 ± 50 mmH□O. The angle between the center line and the horizontal line should be 45 60 ℃, and the diameter of flame orifice as 2. 5 2. 8 mm, the pitch of the edge of flame orifice as 4 6 mm, and the depth of flame orifice as 8 10 mm those are optimum in this research results of the experiment. The throat diameter of mixing tube as 15 20 mm, the length of inlet as 25 30 mm, the length of divergent as 120 150 mm, and the slope as 3 □ 5 □ are the optimum adapted for the present <b>gas</b> <b>burner.</b> The present results can be provided a reference and applied to designing a higher efficiency of natural gas appliance. 本文的研究目的為提升家庭用瓦斯爐之熱效率及預測未來液化天然氣在臺灣之發 展趨勢。瓦斯爐是家家戶戶必備的烹飪器具，臺灣地區供應瓦斯爐的燃料先後有天然氣、 液化石油氣、丙烷混合氣等，最近又增添一項「液化天然氣」。由於，瓦斯爐有一定的燃 熱範圍，不同類別或不同成份的瓦斯，可能無法適用同一爐具。為暸解將來液化天然氣推 廣之後所可能引發的熱變問題，乃以市面上較具代表性之三種不同品牌瓦斯爐作測試。測 試標準採用CNS 3101 家庭用燃氣爐具規範，測試結果發現只要適當調整噴嘴尺寸，就無所 謂熱變問題，如浮火、回火、紅火等，惟其熱效率普通遠不到國家標準所訂的 45 ﹪。經實 驗測試瓦斯流量、瓦斯壓力一次空氣量、爐架高低、鍋子形狀、燃燒器頭尺寸形狀等等， 得知影響熱效率之主要因素在於燃燒器頭之焰孔角度以及所搭配之爐架高度是否適中。本 文將測試比較十餘種不同型式之燃燒器頭，以求得提高瓦斯爐熱效率之最佳設計尺寸...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] There {{are many}} {{processes}} for converting biomass {{into a more}} useful form of energy. One {{of the most popular}} technological processes is through direct combustion of biomass or in a controlled atmosphere or gasification. The current gasifier that has a maximum heat capacity of combustion system of 15. 02 kW, used to burn biomass (oil palm shell) produces gases of low calorific gas through a low calorific swirl <b>gas</b> <b>burner.</b> Some problem appears using low calorific, it causes no circulation and weak swirling flame, and this will be an increase of residence time at high temperature. The <b>gas</b> <b>burner,</b> which is incorporated with the two-stage biomass combustion system, consists of burner tube and swirl-vane. These swirl <b>gas</b> <b>burners</b> that consist of different turning vane positions i. e. 20 o, 30 o and 40 o, are equal to the swirl number of 0. 22, 0. 356 and 0. 508, respectively. The experimental shows that maximum heat release of the <b>gas</b> <b>burner</b> is 5. 8 kW at equivalence ratio of 1. 21 with the gas flow rate of 1. 04 g/hr. The flame temperature of the <b>gas</b> <b>burner</b> reached a range of 590 to 677 oC at the equivalence ratio, of 1. 16 to 1. 66. In case of swirl flames while increased the swirl number, the flame length decreased significantly with the increasing premixing and flame changed from orange-yellow color to a blue color as the characteristics of a higher level of premixing...|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that the Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs), which {{are the most common}} type of nuclear reactor {{existing}} today, usually used to provide a base load electricity. In order to be able to compete with other generation types (fossil and renewables), it would be desirable to develop PWRs with flexible load following capabilities to cope with varying electricity demand, especially in deregulated markets. The thermal efficiency of PWRs can be increased by fitting the power plant with conventional fossil fuel superheaters. This hybrid system has been hypothesised to be able to adjust the power output and the cycle efficiency of PWRs. Such mode of operation would also improve the efficiency of converting the fossil fuel heat because it is applied only at the superheater stage. There are several ways to supply the heat to the superheaters, for example, by using the exhaust gas from the gas turbines and using the conventional <b>gas</b> <b>burner.</b> In this paper, the thermodynamic performance of the hybrid system (PWR with superheater) is investigated for large reactor and Small Modular Reactor (SMR) application. The thermal efficiency of the AP 1000 can be improved from 30. 2 % to 45. 8 % (with CCGT), 35. 6 % (with <b>gas</b> <b>burner),</b> and 36. 6 % (<b>gas</b> <b>burner</b> with reheating). The thermal efficiency of the SMR can be improved from 33. 4 % to nearly 45 % (with CCGT), 35. 5 % (with <b>gas</b> <b>burner),</b> and 37. 4 % (<b>gas</b> <b>burner</b> with reheating). The analysis results show that it is possible for the hybrid system to operate between 65 % and the full power load.

40|$|For heating {{purposes}} in modern households, <b>gas</b> <b>burners</b> are normally applied {{due to their}} simplicity, low cost and easy handling. On the other hand, practical experience showed that conventional, open flame <b>gas</b> <b>burners</b> compared to porous medium systems have low dynamic range, i. e. low power modulation capability and, additionally, higher production of pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). This is especially notable when the burner operates at low thermal power regimes. In {{order to avoid the}} above-mentioned difficulties and disadvantages of conventional burners, new porous medium <b>gas</b> <b>burner</b> system with maximum thermal output of 8 Â kW has been developed. The objective of the presented work is focussed on better understanding and enabling further developing of porous medium burners (PMB) for household heating systems.

40|$|Acoustic {{emission}} spectra {{have been}} obtained for non-premixed turbulent combustion from two small diameter laboratory <b>gas</b> <b>burners,</b> two commercial <b>gas</b> <b>burners</b> and a large <b>gas</b> <b>burner</b> in the firebox of a Babcock-Wilcox Boiler (50, 000 lb steam/hr). The changes in burner size and firing rate represent changes in Reynolds number and changes in air/fuel ratio represent departure from stoichiometric proportions. The combustion efficiency was measured independently through gas analysis. The acoustic spectra obtained from the various burners exhibit a persistent shape over the Reynolds number range of 8200 - 82, 000. The spectra were analyzed for identification of a predictable frequency domain that is most responsive to, and readily correlated with, combustion efficiency. A simple parameter (consisting of {{the ratio of the}} average acoustic power output in the most responsive frequency bandwidth to the acoustic power level of the loudest frequency) is proposed whose value increases significantly and unmistakably as combustion efficiency approaches 100 %.
