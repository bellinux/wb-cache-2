5|$|The {{order was}} given {{and the group}} formed up across the entire street, from curb to curb. They fixed bayonets and advanced. Shots were fired at the troops, but they {{successfully}} moved {{through the crowd and}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E
5|$|At {{the center}} of the station, the marines find the colonists cocooned, serving as {{incubators}} for the creatures' offspring. When the marines kill a chestburster, the other aliens are roused and ambush the troops, killing Frost, Crowe, Wierzboswki, and Drake while capturing Apone and Dietrich alive to be cocooned as hosts. When the inexperienced Gorman panics, Ripley assumes command, taking control of their armored personnel carrier, and rams the nest to rescue Corporal Hicks, Private Hudson and Private Vasquez, the only three survivors. Hicks orders the dropship to recover the survivors, but a stowaway alien kills the pilots Spunkmeyer and Ferro, causing it to crash <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>station.</b> The remaining group barricade themselves inside the colony command center.|$|E
5|$|Between 9:00pm and 10:00pm {{the guards}} enacted a {{strategy}} whereby the police officers, {{backed by the}} bayonets of the soldiers, advanced to the crowd and arrested each a man, who was then taken <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>station,</b> disarmed, and held there. The strategy was largely successful, and by 11:00pm {{the area around the}} station was mostly cleared, though sporadic gunfire could be heard throughout the night. Between 165 and 200 were detained in total, and the most violent of the captives were removed and taken to the police station. The news reported that four, including one police officer, were injured in the exchange, and several who resisted arrest were beaten severely.|$|E

5|$|Built {{as a local}} station, {{the station}} was {{constructed}} with bellmouth provisions to allow conversion into an express station. A close observation of both ends of this station reveals that the tunnel wall extends outward to allow space for the two side platforms to be replaced with island platforms, with the local tracks taking the side platforms' place. The station would have accommodated a major system expansion, with additional service coming from the Roosevelt Avenue Terminal station and the former LIRR Rockaway Line. Requests to convert the station were also put forward by the local community shortly after the station opened, due to heavy bus traffic feeding <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>station</b> and overcrowding at the Roosevelt Avenue express stop.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel initiates {{a second}} {{broadcast}} by showing a simulated {{explosion of the}} U.S. Capitol building, causing a public panic. Farrell guesses that his next target is likely the power grid, and the two drive to a utility superstation in West Virginia. They find {{a team led by}} Mai taking over the station. McClane manages to kill all of them, including Mai. He obtains video footage of Gabriel which he relays to the FBI. Enraged over Mai's death, Gabriel seizes control of the natural gas distribution system and redirects all of the gas <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>station.</b> McClane and Farrell escape before the station explodes, leaving much of the eastern seaboard of the United States and Canada without power.|$|E
5|$|Helen {{brings the}} jewels to an appraiser, who recognizes them as having {{recently}} been reported stolen. Donelly and Gates bring Helen <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>station,</b> where they inform her Hal is the Creeper and accuse her of harboring a murderer. Reluctantly, she agrees {{to help them}} capture him. The next day, the newspapers run stories about Helen cooperating with police, which infuriates Hal. Feeling betrayed, he sneaks back into her apartment and finds her playing the piano. Sneaking up from behind, Hal is about to strangle her when the police seize and arrest him. The film ends with Donelly and Gates assuring Helen she will get the operation she needs.|$|E

5|$|In 1889 Waterloo Station (renamed from Waterloo Bridge {{station in}} 1886) was {{equipped}} with new signals, which required a gantry spanning all the lines <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>station.</b> In return for the LSWR cladding the LNC's entrance on Westminster Bridge Road with white glazed brick, the LNC gave consent for the stanchion supporting the gantry {{to rest on the}} LNC's platform, while reserving the right to demand the gantry be removed. At this time the LSWR also leased a small plot of land west of the Westminster Bridge Road entrance to serve as the site of new offices for the LNC, designed by Cyril Bazett Tubbs.|$|E
5|$|Next, {{the train}} passes through two {{consecutive}} horseshoe turns, {{first to the}} right and then to the left. As the name suggests, Horseshoe turns are highly banked horseshoe-shaped turns which feature track entering from roughly the same direction as where it exits. As the train exits the second horseshoe, it swoops down and begins a 270-degree helix to the right, which leads into the ride's second inversion, an inline twist. The inline twist sees riders perform a full rotation around the track, starting from a position where they are facing downward. After completing the twist, the train reaches the brake run and a final right-hand turn that leads back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>station.</b>|$|E
5|$|On November 3, 2004, an {{out-of-service}} Red Line train rolled {{backward into}} the Woodley Park – Zoo / Adams Morgan station and hit an in-service train {{stopped at the}} platform. No one was killed, but 20 people were injured. A 14-month investigation concluded that the train operator was most likely not alert as the train rolled backward <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>station.</b> Safety officials estimated that had the train been full, at least 79 would have died. The train operator was dismissed and Metro officials agreed to add rollback protection to more than 300 rail cars.|$|E

5|$|The London Underground {{station is}} on the Bakerloo line between Baker Street and Edgware Road {{stations}} and is, along with the main line station, in Transport for London fare zone 1. Access is via escalators from the main line station concourse which houses the Underground station's ticket office. Until 2004, a wooden escalator led <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>station,</b> {{one of the last}} on the London Underground system that had not been replaced {{as a consequence of the}} King's Cross fire in 1987.|$|E
5|$|The station {{complex is}} in Victoria in the City of Westminster, {{immediately}} {{south of the}} London Inner Ring Road.

40|$|In {{conventional}} processors, each {{instruction cache}} fetch brings {{in a group}} of instructions. Upon encountering an instruction cache miss, the processor will wait until the instruction cache miss is serviced before continuing to fetch any new instructions. This paper presents a new technique, called out-oforder issue, which allows the processor to temporarily ignore the instructions associated with the instruction cache miss. The processor attempts to fetch the instructions that follow the group of instructions associated with the miss. These instructions are then decoded and written <b>into</b> <b>the</b> processor's reservation <b>stations.</b> Later, after <b>the</b> instruction cache miss has been serviced, the instructions associated with the miss are decoded and written <b>into</b> <b>the</b> reservation <b>stations.</b> (We use <b>the</b> term issue to indicate the act of writing instructions <b>into</b> <b>the</b> reservation <b>stations.</b> With this technique, instructions are not written <b>into</b> <b>the</b> reservation <b>stations</b> in program order.

5|$|The stations' closure also {{forced the}} Tyne Sea Scouts, who had {{operated}} from the North station since 1978, to seek new accommodation. The scouts had moved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>station</b> when their boat house in Blyth was deemed unsafe and demolished. They had been provided with two site offices, storage {{in the power}} station complex, and permission to keep their boats at the North station's jetty, {{at the end of}} which they had a slipway built.|$|E
5|$|On February 20, 1975, the Redevelopment Agency {{voted to}} {{demolish}} the building. Union Railroad Station Trust asked the Boston architectural firm Anderson-Notter {{to prepare a}} study of adding office and restaurant space. George M. Notter, one of the firm's principals (and later president of the American Institute of Architects), was an early advocate of adaptive reuse. Surprised that no developers were pursuing {{what he saw as}} a sure profit, Notter formed Union Station Associates as a subsidiary of Anderson-Notter and invested a substantial sum of his own money <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>station.</b> Notter convinced Amtrak to agree to a 20-year lease for part of the station at $45,000 annually, thus giving the group a stronger negotiating point. After eighteen months of negotiations, Union Station Associates purchased the building on July 24, 1975, effectively saving the station. The group paid only the cost of the underlying land, $11,400 – the same figure Scheetz initially offered two years before.|$|E
5|$|The Missing Link {{takes place}} during the events of Human Revolution: after staging an {{explosion}} in the docks of Hengsha, Adam Jensen smuggles himself on board a ship bound for a secret research base inside a cryosleep pod.

After the EMP chair holding him captive mysteriously deactivates, Adam is able to retrieve his equipment {{with the help of an}} unknown hacker who contacts him via radio. The ship docks at Rifleman Bank Station, a seaborne regional Belltower supply hub. After escaping <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>station,</b> Adam discovers that it was Keitner who set him free. Disillusioned with the unethical nature of local Belltower operations, she wants Adam to find concrete proof of illegal research that she can use to deliver to Interpol.
