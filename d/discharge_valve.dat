The valve is opened as the discharge fuel pressure increases above the force from the spring, thereby lowering the fuel pressure to maintain a balanced position with the spring force.|$|E
50|$|Scroll {{compressors}} {{never have}} a suction valve, but depending on the application {{may or may not}} have a <b>discharge</b> <b>valve.</b> The use of a dynamic <b>discharge</b> <b>valve</b> is more prominent in high pressure ratio applications, typical of refrigeration. Typically, an air-conditioning scroll does not have a dynamic <b>discharge</b> <b>valve.</b> The use of a dynamic <b>discharge</b> <b>valve</b> improves scroll compressor efficiency over a wide range of operating conditions, when the operating pressure ratio is well above the built-in pressure ratio of the compressors. If the compressor is designed to operate near a single operating point, then the scroll compressor can actually gain efficiency around this point if there is no dynamic <b>discharge</b> <b>valve</b> present (since there are additional discharge flow losses associated with the presence of the <b>discharge</b> <b>valve</b> as well as discharge ports tend to be smaller when the discharge is present).|$|E

30|$|The three {{revolute}} joints of each {{hind leg}} use six pneumatic muscles in total, and each pneumatic muscle {{is controlled by}} two high-speed switch valves. Thus, the entire hind limb requires 12 pneumatic high-speed switch valves. We consider the hip joint as an example to explain the working principle of the pneumatic circuit. The body and the thigh crank are connected with a joint shaft. Each end of the crank is hinged to the muscles, and the other ends {{are connected to the}} body frame. During muscle contraction and stretching, the crank (fixed with the thigh frame) rotates relative to the body. To reach the initial position, the charging <b>valve</b> 1 and <b>discharging</b> <b>valve</b> 2 are open, and the <b>discharging</b> <b>valve</b> 1 and charging valve 2 are closed. The recovery muscle then starts to contract, and the driving muscle stretches until the joint rotates clockwise to the preset position (Figure  6). During the propulsive phase, the hip joint must rotate counterclockwise quickly, and thus the charging <b>valve</b> 1 and <b>discharging</b> <b>valve</b> 2 are close, and charging valve 1 and the <b>discharging</b> <b>valve</b> 2 are open. The recovery muscle of the hip joint then starts to stretch and the driving muscle contracts. The hip joint rotates counterclockwise quickly to a specific position.|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an analytical investigation on the practicability of using mechanically operated <b>discharge</b> <b>valves</b> in conjunction with a manually operated intake control for improving the performance of N. A. C. A. Roots type superchargers. These valves, which may be either of the oscillating or rotating type, are placed in the discharge opening of the supercharger and are so shaped and synchronized with the supercharger impellers that they do not open until the air has been compressed to the delivery pressure. The intake control limits the quantity of air compressed to engine requirements by permitting the excess air to escape from the compression chamber before compression begins. The percentage power saving and the actual horsepower saved were computed for altitudes from 0 to 20, 000 feet. These computations are based on the pressure-volume cards for the conventional and the modified roots type superchargers and on the results of laboratory tests of the conventional type. The use of <b>discharge</b> <b>valves</b> shows a power saving of approximately 26 per cent at a critical altitude of 20, 000 feet. In addition, these valves reduce the amplitude of the discharge pulsations and increase the volumetric efficiency. With slow-speed roots blowers operating at high-pressure differences even better results would be expected. For aircraft engine superchargers operating at high speeds these <b>discharge</b> <b>valves</b> increase the performance as above, but have the disadvantages of increasing the weight and of adding a high-speed mechanism to a simple machine.

50|$|The {{isentropic}} {{efficiency of}} scroll compressors is {{slightly higher than}} that of a typical reciprocating compressor when the compressor is designed to operate near one selected rating point. The scroll compressors are more efficient in this case because {{they do not have a}} dynamic <b>discharge</b> <b>valve</b> that introduces additional throttling losses. However, the efficiency of a scroll compressor that does not have a <b>discharge</b> <b>valve</b> begins to decrease as compared to the reciprocating compressor at higher pressure ratio operation. This is a result of under-compression losses that occur at high pressure ratio operation of the positive displacement compressors that do not have a dynamic <b>discharge</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E
50|$|In one {{hydraulic}} control variant the valve is opened passively by {{the thrust of}} the medium. In this case the <b>discharge</b> <b>valve</b> has a non-return function which prevents flowback from the pressure line. At the same time the high-densitiy solids are precompacted to close to the line pressure before the <b>discharge</b> <b>valve</b> opens. This means that pipe knocking resulting from pressure pulsations can be avoided.|$|E

40|$|Analytical and {{experimental}} studies of the vibration response of a reciprocating compressor {{have led to the}} development of a procedure for the detection and diagnosis of valve faults. The procedure uses the Smoothed-Pseudo-Wigner Ville Distribution (SPWVD) to interpret monitored impact response vibration.

50|$|A {{positive}} displacement pump must not operate against a closed valve on the discharge side of the pump, because it has no shutoff head like centrifugal pumps. A {{positive displacement}} pump operating against a closed <b>discharge</b> <b>valve</b> continues to produce flow and the pressure in the discharge line increases until the line bursts, the pump is severely damaged, or both.|$|E
5000|$|The {{steel housing}} {{of the seat}} valve pump {{contains}} four hydraulically controlled seat valves, two suction and two delivery valves for the two hydraulic cylinders. The suction and <b>discharge</b> <b>valves</b> are synchronized with the hydraulics of the delivery pistons - this ensures that {{the contents of the}} delivery cylinder is equal at all times to the volume being pumped. Once the [...] "sucking" [...] piston reaches its end position, the corresponding suction or delivery valve is simultaneously closed or opened. If there is overpressure in the delivery line, the suction valve will close first. This prevents the pumped medium from being pushed out of the pressure line back into the hopper.|$|R

The control module includes the master control panel, the loadmaster's seat, and <b>discharge</b> <b>valves.</b> An air compressor module provides air pressure for charging the system; it stays at the airtanker base during air operations and is used to recharge the system between runs.

50|$|These {{consist of}} a {{cylinder}} with a reciprocating plunger. The suction and <b>discharge</b> <b>valves</b> are mounted in {{the head of the}} cylinder. In the suction stroke the plunger retracts and the suction valves open causing suction of fluid into the cylinder. In the forward stroke the plunger pushes the liquid out of the discharge valve.Efficiency and common problems: With only one cylinder in plunger pumps, the fluid flow varies between maximum flow when the plunger moves through the middle positions, and zero flow when the plunger is at the end positions. A lot of energy is wasted when the fluid is accelerated in the piping system. Vibration and water hammer may be a serious problem. In general the problems are compensated for by using two or more cylinders not working in phase with each other.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of tests led with scroll compressors to establish pressure-volume diagrams. Two compressors were thinly instrumented with pressure and displacement sensors so as to follow the whole compression process, from suction to exhaust. A gear coder was set to mark off the closing and opening of gas pockets, and to study the speed variations occurring during a single rotation. These tests help to understand the various phenomena met in a compressor, such as back-flow, overshoot, leakages, at the different operating points. Comparing an ideal pressure-volume diagram to the experimental one enables identification of improvement possibilities. One of the compressors was equipped with Inlet <b>Discharge</b> <b>Valves</b> that could be deactivated.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of CFD simulations of the compression process of a scroll compressor. The compressor geometry accounts for the final scroll gas pockets, two Intermediate <b>Discharge</b> <b>Valves</b> (IDVs), the central discharge zone and the upper shell. Â The numerical model uses a real gas equation of state to determine gas properties during the compression process and accounts for the motion of the orbiting scroll and IDVs using a mesh smoothing and remeshing algorithm. Â The IDVs are represented as a spring mass system with their movement controlled via the pressure difference around the valve. Â Appropriate pressure based boundary conditions are used at entry to the third gas pocket and at the exit of the upper shell. An initial analysis of the results has shown {{that it is possible to}} achieve time accurate results of the pressure field throughout the flow domain and also determine the impact of the IDVs on scroll performance. Â The results will also enable a more thorough analysis of the fluid flow and compression process inside the scroll in order to improve its performance...|$|R
50|$|Reciprocating pumps {{move the}} fluid using {{one or more}} {{oscillating}} pistons, plungers, or membranes (diaphragms), while valves restrict fluid motion to the desired direction. In order for suction to take place, the pump must first pull the plunger in an outward motion to decrease pressure in the chamber. Once the plunger pushes back, it will increase the pressure chamber and the inward pressure of the plunger will then open the <b>discharge</b> <b>valve</b> and release the fluid into the delivery pipe at a high velocity.|$|E
50|$|After a {{delay of}} 1, 3, or 8 seconds, {{during which time}} fuel was {{circulated}} through the thrust chamber to condition the engine for start, the start tank <b>discharge</b> <b>valve</b> was opened to initiate turbine spin.

50|$|In piston {{aircraft}} engines, continuous-flow {{fuel injection}} {{is the most}} common type. In contrast to automotive fuel injection systems, aircraft continuous flow fuel injection is all mechanical, requiring no electricity to operate. Two common types exist: the Bendix RSA system, and the TCM system. The Bendix system is a direct descendant of the pressure carburetor. However, instead of having a <b>discharge</b> <b>valve</b> in the barrel, it uses a flow divider mounted on top of the engine, which controls the discharge rate and evenly distributes the fuel to stainless steel injection lines to the intake ports of each cylinder. The TCM system is even more simple. It has no venturi, no pressure chambers, no diaphragms, and no <b>discharge</b> <b>valve.</b> The control unit is fed by a constant-pressure fuel pump. The control unit simply uses a butterfly valve for the air, which is linked by a mechanical linkage to a rotary valve for the fuel. Inside the control unit is another restriction, which controls the fuel mixture. The pressure drop across the restrictions in the control unit controls the amount of fuel flow, so that fuel flow is directly proportional to the pressure at the flow divider. In fact, most aircraft that use the TCM fuel injection system feature a fuel flow gauge that is actually a pressure gauge calibrated in gallons per hour or pounds per hour of fuel.|$|E

Although the attack was planned for 10 February, it was postponed when the Germans destroyed the <b>discharge</b> <b>valves</b> on the Schwammenauel Dam, causing a steady but long lasting flooding of the Roer River. It wasn’t until 23 February that floodwaters receded enough for the attack to finally proceed. In the predawn darkness of 23 February, the tankers provided direct fire support {{from the west bank}} of the Roer for the infantry's predawn attack and the Americans seized Jülich by the end of the day. The 29th Infantry Division continued their attack north toward Mönchengladbach, with the tankers supporting the 175th and 115th Infantry Regiments. The Americans encountered similar resistance as they had west of Jülich, having to reduce strongpoints centered on each town along their march route, with German tanks, self-propelled guns and antitank guns located in well-concealed positions to engage the tanks from the flanks. Despite the Germans’ skilled defense, the tankers noted the reduced resistance compared to their attack on Jülich and reached Mönchengladach on 1 March 1945.|$|R
40|$|Integrity and {{operational}} reliability of pipelines requires a continuous monitoring, able to detect, in real time, failure, sabotage and leak of fluids (e. g. natural gas, crude oil, water, products), {{and to protect}} the safety of personnel and local communities. In the framework of a research project, eni has developed a proprietary pipeline monitoring technology based on vibroacoustic (negative pressure wave) sensing. This paper presents some experimental and theoretical activities for the evaluation of the system performance versus fluid leaks, in terms of maximum detection distance and sensitivity.

The associated travelling pressure transient, recorded by several monitoring stations, has been compared with the environmental noise (generated by the flow regulation equipment) and with the theoretical models.
