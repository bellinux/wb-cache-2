50|$|Another {{positive}} {{environmental impact}} {{is the effect}} of higher energy prices on consumer choices, similar to the US market trend toward more fuel-efficient cars. As electric bills have risen, residents are reducing their electrical usage by using more moderate thermostat settings, installing insulation, installing solar screens, and other such activities. Texas utilities (such as Austin Energy) are also installing advanced electricity meters that may one day enable variable pricing based on the time of day. This would permit energy customers to save money by further tailoring their consumption based on whether it occurred during the peak <b>demand</b> <b>period</b> (high cost/high pollution) or the off-peak (night time).|$|E

40|$|The {{first part}} of my {{dissertation}} considers the estimation of a panel data model with error components that are both spatially and time-wise correlated. The dissertation combines widely used model for spatial correlation (Cliff and Ord (1973, 1981)) with the classical error component panel data model. I introduce generalizations of the generalized moments (GM) procedure suggested in Kelejian and Prucha (1999) for estimating the spatial autoregressive parameter {{in case of a}} single cross section. I then use those estimators to define feasible generalized least squares (GLS) procedures for the regression parameters. I give formal large sample results concerning the consistency of the proposed GM procedures, as well as the consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed feasible GLS procedures. The new estimators remain computationally feasible even in large samples. The second part of my dissertation employs a Cliff-Ord-type model to empirically estimate {{the nature and extent of}} price competition in the US wholesale gasoline industry. I use data on average weekly wholesale gasoline price for 289 terminals (distribution facilities) in the US. Data on demand factors, cost factors and market structure that affect price are also used. I consider two time periods, a high <b>demand</b> <b>period</b> (August 1999) and a low <b>demand</b> <b>period</b> (January 2000). I find a high level of competition in prices between neighboring terminals. In particular, price in one terminal is significantly and positively correlated to the price of its neighboring terminal. Moreover, I find this to be much higher during the low <b>demand</b> <b>period,</b> as compared to the high <b>demand</b> <b>period.</b> In contrast to previous work, I include for each terminal the characteristics of the marginal customer by controlling for demand factors in the neighboring location. I find these demand factors to be important during period of high demand and insignificant during the low <b>demand</b> <b>period.</b> Furthermore, I have also considered spatial correlation in unobserved factors that affect price. I find it to be high and significant only during the low <b>demand</b> <b>period.</b> Not correcting for it leads to incorrect inferences regarding exogenous explanatory variables...|$|E
40|$|Time-of-Use (TOU) pricing is a rate {{of prices}} {{depending}} on time period, which having high electricity tariff at peak <b>demand</b> <b>period</b> and lower tariff at off-peak period. In Malaysia, a flat tariff is applied on residential customer disregard the time of use. Simple TOU pricing is applied on industrial and commercial customers where they pay lower tariff for the electricity used during night time and higher tariff for daytime usage. This to encourage the customer to shifts their electricity usage from peak <b>demand</b> <b>period</b> (daytime) into low <b>demand</b> <b>period</b> (night time). The same TOU pricing cannot be implemented to residential customers since their load is already low during daytime but high during night time (8 pm- 12 pm). This paper studies the TOU prices required for residential customers to make {{a significant impact on}} peak demand reduction. Practical load profile data from Malaysian residential and commercial customers are used as a case study. The result shows a significant price difference between the peak and off-peak hours are required to ensure the effectiveness of such pricing...|$|E

50|$|To reduce demand {{during the}} high cost peak usage periods, {{communications}} and metering technologies inform smart devices {{in the home and}} business when energy demand is high and track how much electricity is used and when it is used. It also gives utility companies the ability to reduce consumption by communicating to devices directly in order to prevent system overloads. Examples would be a utility reducing the usage of a group of electric vehicle charging stations or shifting temperature set points of air conditioners in a city. To motivate them to cut back use and perform what is called peak curtailment or peak leveling, prices of electricity are increased during high <b>demand</b> <b>periods,</b> and decreased during low <b>demand</b> <b>periods.</b> It is thought that consumers and businesses will tend to consume less during high <b>demand</b> <b>periods</b> if it is possible for consumers and consumer devices {{to be aware of the}} high price premium for using electricity at peak periods. This could mean making trade-offs such as cycling on/off air conditioners or running dishwashers at 9 pm instead of 5 pm. When businesses and consumers see a direct economic benefit of using energy at off-peak times, the theory is that they will include energy cost of operation into their consumer device and building construction decisions and hence become more energy efficient.
