25|$|A <b>drill</b> <b>bushing,</b> {{also known}} as a jig bushing, is a tool used in {{metalworking}} jigs to guide cutting tools, most commonly drill bits. Other tools that are commonly used in a <b>drill</b> <b>bushing</b> include counterbores, countersinks, and reamers. They are designed to guide, position, and support the cutting tool.|$|E
50|$|A {{drill jig}} {{is a type}} of jig that expedites {{repetitive}} hole center location on multiple interchangeable parts by acting as a template to guide the twist drill or other boring device into the precise location of each intended hole center. In metalworking practice, typically a hardened <b>drill</b> <b>bushing</b> lines each hole on the jig plate to keep the tool from damaging the jig.|$|E
50|$|Straight fluted extractors {{may come}} in a kit that also has {{associated}} drills, drill bushings, and special nuts, or be sold individually. The screw is drilled out with the appropriate drill and <b>drill</b> <b>bushing.</b> The extractor is then hammered into the hole with a brass hammer, because a steel hammer will cause the extractor to break. The appropriate special nut is then attached {{to the end of}} the extractor. The nuts can then be turned with a wrench to remove the screw.|$|E

40|$|Study {{of surface}} quality and {{machining}} accuracy {{of a deep}} hole in the camshaft in manufacturing environment is conducted to make recommendations to eliminate emerging stress concentrators on the hole surface after machining and arising cracks while the engine is in operation. So {{it is important to}} conduct a comprehensive task-driven study to determine qualitative and quantitative values of arithmetical mean deviation of the surface roughness profile (parameter of height) and available stress concentrators, as well as to define regularities of changing accuracy parameters for deep-hole length such as deviation size, radial run-out, and geometric tolerance in cross section. A guide diameter of the <b>drill</b> <b>bushing</b> and an outer diameter of the cutting part of one-sided cut have been determined too. A camshaft casting from ductile iron HF 65 - 48 - 1 was processed in the automatic line on the machine "Hȕller" by a drill with the cutting head from the hard alloy VK 6 with simultaneously rotating workpiece and tool. The drill was guided through <b>drill</b> <b>bushing</b> from solid alloy VK 15. The measurement results showed that in 53 % of samples there were tears and scratches up to 0. 15 mm in depth, which could serve as stress concentrators and in the process of operation encourage growth of cracks in the bulk of the camshaft material. A significantly increasing value of the radial run-out size and all six studied harmonic components show that there is a deviation of the hole axis (run) from the nominal (specified) position and faceting available with their copied (increased) values along {{the entire length of the}} hole. This is a qualitative confirmation that in processing the holes in parts made from grey cast iron, there is a mechanism of copying errors earlier available. It is found that the size of a clearance between guide diameter of <b>drill</b> <b>bushing</b> and diameter of tool gage ribbon makes 0. 150 mm and almost 3 times exceeds the recommended value. All this reduces resistance, promotes a wear of the guide elements and a gauge part of the tool. In turn, these reasons create favorable conditions for built-up edge on calibrating and cutting parts of the one-sided cuts which contribute to tears and scratches on the surface of the camshaft hole. Thus, the causes and the mechanism of appearing stress concentrators and their possible growth in the bulk of the material during camshaft operation have been defined. As the wear mechanisms of guide bushing of various drill bits are different, it is advised to settle no more than 80 processing cycles for bushing and at most 63 cycles for drills. The technological operation content on deep drilling to be made has to contain a mandatory checking of the diametral clearance between the <b>drill</b> <b>bushing</b> hole and the calibrating part of the drill, which must be of 0. 055 mm at most. It is recommended to introduce a drill size m= 0. 26 0. 39 mm in its working drawing because it is unavailable there. It allows to reduce deviation of drill cutting part from the nominal position, tool vibration, run of axis and faceting the camshaft holes. The elaborated recommendations can be used in the development of similar drilling operations. </p...|$|E
25|$|Released {{military}} {{records show}} that Bush's documented service record through mid-April 1972 (<b>Bush</b> <b>drilled</b> on the 15th and 16th of that month) was without gaps; the period in question is from May 1972 forward.|$|R
40|$|A novel technique, {{referred}} to as a vector setting in the aerospace industry, has been developed for positioning and orienting <b>drilling</b> <b>bushes</b> on curved surfaces. The position and orientation of holes and their axes in parts and tooling in the aerospace industry must conform to strict tolerances; however, the process of locating and orienting the <b>bushes</b> in <b>drilling</b> plates having curved surfaces is slow and time consuming. This is because the existing process used is a trial and error one, and past research in automated drilling in the aerospace industry has not covered this area. A prototype device has been developed which reduces the setting time. The device has two angular adjustments, which are computed using specially written software. The device is used in conjunction with a 3 D spatial measurement system in order to determine reference points on the part or tooling and the device. Experimental results on a prototype indicate a substantial time saving as well as good accuracy in orienting the drill axis at a given point on a surface...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the past}} few years, process {{monitoring}} of drilling processes using force and vibration signals has successfully been established. However, only few investigations were performed in the monitoring of chip breakage and chip transportation, while in gun drilling these properties are more relevant to ensure process robustness and performance than force and vibration. This paper presents a new monitoring approach of chip frequency and transportation for gun drilling processes using infrared light reflection next to the <b>drilling</b> <b>bush.</b> Gun <b>drilling</b> is a high performance cutting process used for small diameter and large aspect ratio drilling operations {{in the field of}} automotive, aeronautic, power generation and medical devices. The usage of new harder materials for future products increases the challenge of proper chip transportation and raises the need of chip monitoring being able to operate with economically acceptable parameters. The approach of optical chip detection highlights the opportunity of detecting chips smaller than 1 mm and velocities in axial direction of more than 16 m/s clearly and suggests new characteristic values to be used for process validation. For implementing the measurement principle a new sensor is designed. In addition, the opportunities of future data analysis and detection of characteristic values are explained...|$|R
50|$|Such was the {{popularity}} of the pith helmet that it became a common civilian headgear for Westerners in the tropics and sub-tropics from the mid-19th century. The civilian pith helmet usually had the same dimensions and outline as its contemporary military counterpart though it lacked decorative extras such as badges. It was worn by men and women, old and young, both on formal and casual occasions, until the 1940s. Both white and khaki versions were used. It was often worn together with civilian versions of khaki <b>drill</b> and/or <b>bush</b> jackets.|$|R
50|$|In January 1959, the Cuban Revolution overthrew the Cuban {{government}} of Fulgencio Batista, and Bush bought control of Zapata Off-Shore, funded with $800,000, splitting Zapata Corporation into two independent companies with the Liedtkes still {{in control of}} Zapata Petroleum. Bush moved his offices and family that year from Midland, Texas to Houston {{for access to the}} Caribbean through the Houston Ship Channel. But although Zapata Offshore had only a few <b>drilling</b> rigs, <b>Bush</b> set up operations also in the Gulf of Mexico, the Persian Gulf, Trinidad, Borneo, and Medellín, Colombia, and the Kuwait Shell Petroleum Development Company was among the company's clients.|$|R

50|$|The company traces {{its origins}} to Zapata Oil, founded in 1953 by future-U.S. President George H. W. Bush, {{along with his}} {{business}} partners John Overbey, Hugh Liedtke, Bill Liedtke, and Thomas J. Devine. Overbey was a ‘landman’, skilled in scouting oil fields and obtaining <b>drilling</b> rights cheaply. <b>Bush</b> and Thomas J. Devine were oil-wildcatting associates. Their joint activities culminated {{in the establishment of}} Zapata Oil. The initial $1 million investment for Zapata was provided by the Liedtke brothers and their circle of investors, by Bush's father Prescott Bush and hismaternal grandfather George Herbert Walker, and their family's circle of friends. Hugh Liedtke was named president, Bush was vice president; Overbey soon left.|$|R
2500|$|Early in {{the life}} of the Viscount {{aircraft}} type, renewal of the inner lower booms included installation of new mount fittings for attachment of the rear of the two inboard engine nacelles to the lower booms. [...] New fittings were supplied without pre-drilled holes and the holes were drilled during installation to correctly align the engine nacelle with the wing. However, after considerable in-service experience of the boom-renewal process British Aircraft Corporation amended the procedure to allow re-use of the engine nacelle rear mount fittings. Re-use of the old fittings relied on the existing holes aligning closely with the bushes in the new inner lower booms. [...] When new inner lower booms were installed in VH-RMQ in 1958, new engine nacelle rear mount fittings were also installed but when new booms were again installed in 1964 the fittings first installed in 1958 were re-used. [...] In the wreckage of the right wing of VH-RMQ there was evidence of an initial problem while trying to align the five holes in the old fitting with the bushes in the new boom. The bores of three bushes had been scored with a drill, possibly while maintenance personnel were trying to align three of the holes sufficiently to be able to insert the attachment bolts. Running a <b>drill</b> through the <b>bush</b> at Station 143 may have disturbed the bush and initiated a sequence of actions leading to fatal damage to the wall of the hole.|$|R
