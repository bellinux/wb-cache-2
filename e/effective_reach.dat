Hitler created a three-man committee {{with representatives of}} the State, the army, and the Party in an attempt to centralise control of the war economy. The committee members were Hans Lammers (head of the Reich Chancellery), Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, chief of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Armed Forces High Command; OKW), and Bormann, who controlled the Party. The committee was intended to independently propose measures regardless of the wishes of various ministries, with Hitler reserving most final decisions to himself. The committee, soon known as the Dreierausschuß (Committee of Three), met eleven times between January and August 1943. However, they ran up against resistance from Hitler's cabinet ministers, who headed deeply entrenched spheres of influence and were excluded from the committee. Seeing it as a threat to their power, Goebbels, Göring, and Speer worked together to bring it down. The result was that nothing changed, and the Committee of Three declined into irrelevance.|$|E

Even less research has examined what messages most effectively engage these landholders, or landholders in general. In this study, eight communications campaigns were developed with specific messages and appeals that allowed us to examine the perceptions of difficult-to-reach landholders towards rational versus emotional, inform versus persuade and individual versus community-based appeals, using a qualitative methodology. The findings indicate that landholder’s perceptions of both rational and emotional messages depended on the congruence with segment values. Inform messages were found often to be well regarded, especially when they clarified eligibility and program benefits.

5000|$|After 1900, Switzerland, Britain, and the United States adopted rifles with barrel lengths {{shorter than}} that of a rifled musket, but longer {{than that of}} a carbine. These new rifles were {{intended}} for general use by both the infantry and cavalry. Due to the reduction in barrel length, the overall [...] "reach" [...] of the new short rifles with attached bayonet was reduced. In the case of Britain, this occurred when the British Army adopted a shortened Lee-Enfield rifle, the SMLE, in 1904. As a consequence, the German M1898 Mauser rifle and attached sword bayonet was a full eight inches longer than the British SMLE and its P1903 bayonet, which used a twelve-inch blade. While the British P1903 and its similar predecessor, the P1888, had proved completely satisfactory in service, a storm of criticism soon arose regarding the <b>effective</b> <b>reach</b> of the new short rifles when equipped with a fixed bayonet. One military writer of the day warned: [...] "The German soldier has eight inches the better of the argument over the British soldier when it comes to crossing bayonets, and the extra eight inches easily turns the battle in favour of the longer, if both men are of equal skill."In 1905 the German Army adopted a shortened (37 cm or 14.6-inch) bayonet, the Seitengewehr 98/06 for engineer and pioneer troops, and in 1908, a short rifle as well, the Karabiner Model 1898AZ, which was produced in limited quantities for the cavalry, artillery, and other specialist troops. [...] However, the long-barreled 98 Mauser rifle remained in service as the primary infantry small arm. Moreover, German military authorities continued to promote the idea of outreaching one's opponent on the battlefield by means of a longer rifle/bayonet combination, a concept prominently featured in its infantry bayonet training doctrines. These included the throw point or extended thrust-and-lunge attack. Using this tactic, the German soldier dropped into a half-crouch, with the rifle and fixed bayonet held close to the body. In this position the soldier next propelled his rifle forward, then dropped the supporting hand while taking a step forward with the right foot, simultaneously thrusting out the right arm full length with the extended rifle held in the grip of the right hand alone. With a maximum 'kill zone' of some eleven feet, the throw point bayonet attack gave an impressive increase in 'reach', and was later adopted by other military forces, including the U.S. Army.|$|E

40|$|African {{economic}} development is stifled because most countries are notional states. The notional state {{must not be}} confused with rhetoric of corruption and failed states. Rather, the <b>effective</b> <b>reach</b> (in a spatial sense) of the African state is efficiently attenuated in virtue of the benefits and costs of extending coherent governance beyond the capital city. This stands {{in stark contrast to the}} concept and the practice of nation building and the state as it evolved over centuries in Western Europe. In Europe, strong states evolved out of a necessity to protect valuable agricultural assets during an era in which land-based wealth was paramount. European states became strong because they could not afford to be weak. African states are weak because they have no good reasons to be strong. The “mask of citizenship ” reflects reciprocal estrangement between citizens and the government. Colonialism in Africa did nothing to extend the <b>effective</b> <b>reach</b> of the state, and post-independence governments have found no good reasons to do so. The essential step to extend the reach of governance beyond the capital city is the tax bargain in which all individuals would contribute to the public purse. This will gradually mobilize revenue for the provision of missing collective consumption goods and services. Of greater import, the tax bargain will give “voice ” to those in rural areas and will force central governments to listen to demands for coherent governance. Only then will {{economic development}} be possible...|$|E
