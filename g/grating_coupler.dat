50|$|An {{example of}} guided-mode {{resonance}} is a <b>grating</b> <b>coupler,</b> {{which is a}} region on top of or below a waveguide {{where there is a}} grating. Off-resonance light incident on the grating behaves almost the same as it would if it was incident in an area where there is no grating. Waveguides are usually made of dielectric and are transparent. For specific combinations of incident angles and light frequency, there is resonance, allowing the grating to couple light into a guided mode of the waveguide.|$|E
50|$|Typically, the <b>grating</b> <b>coupler</b> {{has only}} a few periods, so light can be coupled into the {{waveguide}}, but not back out. In such a case, light will be guided in the waveguide until it reaches the waveguide edge, or an additional coupling element, which will couple the light out. The larger the diffraction efficiency of the grating, the larger percent of light that would be coupled in. If the grating {{is used as a}} coupling-out element, the larger the diffraction efficiency, the fewer periods would be needed to couple the light out.|$|E
50|$|A <b>grating</b> <b>coupler</b> that is {{extended}} {{over the whole}} surface of the grating results in a combined structure sometimes called a grating waveguide structure. In such a structure, light cannot be guided, as any light coupled in is also coupled out. At resonance, a normally transparent structure becomes reflective. If the grating period is sub-wavelength, then the normally-transparent structure becomes a mirror under resonance conditions. These conditions include the angle, frequency (wavelength), and polarization of the incident light. At resonance, {{there is also a}} much higher intensity in the waveguide region. Such intensities are called evanescent as they decay exponentially outside of the waveguide region.|$|E

50|$|Light may be {{confined}} {{in the middle}} layer by total internal reflection. This occurs only if the dielectric index of the middle layer is larger {{than that of the}} surrounding layers. In practice slab waveguides are not infinite in the direction parallel to the interface, but if the typical size of the interfaces is much much larger than the depth of the layer, the slab waveguide model will be an excellent approximation. Guided modes of a slab waveguide cannot be excited by light incident from the top or bottom interfaces. Light must be injected with a lens from the side into the middle layer. Alternatively a coupling element may be used to couple light into the waveguide, such as a <b>grating</b> <b>coupler</b> or prism coupler.|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, {{coupling}} of photons into SPPs can {{be achieved}} using a coupling medium such as a prism or grating to match the photon and SPP wave vectors (and thus match their momenta). A prism can be positioned against a thin metal film in the Kretschmann configuration or very close to a metal surface in the Otto configuration (Figure 1). A <b>grating</b> <b>coupler</b> matches the wave vectors by increasing the parallel wave vector component by an amount related to the grating period (Figure 2). This method, while less frequently utilized, {{is critical to the}} theoretical understanding of the effect of surface roughness. Moreover, simple isolated surface defects such as a groove, a slit or a corrugation on an otherwise planar surface provides a mechanism by which free-space radiation and SPs can exchange energy and hence couple.|$|E
