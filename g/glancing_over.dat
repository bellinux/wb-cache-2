2500|$|The view of South Indian Vaishnava {{groups on}} sarga, or subtle creation, {{is based upon}} scriptural {{adherence}} to Narayana or Vishnu being the cause of creation expanding into Viraja and then [...] <b>glancing</b> <b>over</b> pradhana, {{and that is the}} start of actual function of creation.

2500|$|Shortly {{after this}} point the steady, middle portion of the film begins, {{containing}} the famous look-back frame 352. Patterson said, [...] "it turned a total of I think three times," [...] the other times therefore being before the filming began and/or while he was running with his finger off the trigger. Shortly after <b>glancing</b> <b>over</b> its shoulder on film, the creature disappeared behind a grove of trees for 14 seconds, then reappeared in the film's final 15 seconds after Patterson moved ten feet to a better vantage point, fading into the trees again and being lost to view [...] {{at a distance of}} 265 feet as the reel of film ran out.|$|E
2500|$|Buchenwald {{had first}} caught the {{attention}} of Waldeck in 1941 when <b>glancing</b> <b>over</b> the camp's death list, he came across the name of Dr. Walter Krämer, a head hospital orderly at Buchenwald. He recognized it because Dr. Krämer had successfully treated him in the past. The Prince investigated the case and discovered Karl Otto Koch, the Camp Commandant, had ordered both Krämer and Karl Peixof (a hospital attendant) killed as [...] "political prisoners" [...] because they had treated him for syphilis, a fact Koch wished to keep secret. Waldeck-Pyrmont also received reports that a certain prisoner had been shot while attempting to escape. By that time, Koch had been transferred to the Majdanek concentration camp in Poland, but his wife, Ilse, was still living at the Commandant's house in Buchenwald. Waldeck-Pyrmont ordered a full scale investigation of the camp by Dr. Georg Konrad Morgen, an SS officer who was a judge in a German court. Throughout the investigation, more of Koch's orders to kill prisoners at the camp were revealed, as well as evidence of embezzlement of property stolen from prisoners. It was also discovered that the prisoner who was [...] "shot while trying to escape" [...] had been told to get water from a well some distance from the camp, then was shot from behind; he had also helped treat Koch for syphilis. A charge of incitement to murder was lodged against Koch by Waldeck-Pyrmont and Dr. Morgen, to which later was added a charge of embezzlement. Other camp officials were also charged, including Ilse Koch. The trial resulted in a death sentence for the Commandant, who was executed by firing squad on 5 April 1945. Morgen was convinced that Ilse Koch was guilty of sadistic crimes, but the charges against her could not be proven; she was detained by German authorities until early 1945.|$|E
