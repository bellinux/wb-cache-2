5|$|Gorgosaurus {{spent as}} much as half its life in the <b>juvenile</b> <b>phase</b> before {{ballooning}} up to near-maximum size in only a few years. This, along with the complete lack of predators intermediate in size between huge adult tyrannosaurids and other small theropods, suggests that these niches may have been filled by juvenile tyrannosaurids. This pattern is seen in modern Komodo dragons, whose hatchlings start off as tree-dwelling insectivores and slowly mature into massive apex predators capable of taking down large vertebrates. Other tyrannosaurids, including Albertosaurus, have been found in aggregations that some have suggested to represent mixed-age packs, but {{there is no evidence of}} gregarious behavior in Gorgosaurus.|$|E

25|$|The species {{appears to}} undergo a major {{transition}} in lifestyle after its <b>juvenile</b> <b>phase,</b> with young individuals leading a pelagic lifestyle, able to be transported to offshore islands such as the Galapagos by currents.

A few species predominantly live offshore on deep sand shoals and reefs, although [...] the larvae and <b>juvenile</b> <b>phases</b> of most species return to inshore grounds, where they spend {{the first few}} years of their lives. Smelt-whitings are benthic carnivores that prey predominantly on polychaetes, a variety of crustaceans, molluscs, and to a lesser extent echinoderms and fish, feeding by detecting vibrations emitted by their prey.|$|R

25|$|Recent {{molecular}} data (particularly {{the production of}} plumbagin) indicate that the remaining flypaper, Triphyophyllum peltatum, {{a member of the}} Dioncophyllaceae, is closely related to Drosophyllum and forms part of a larger clade of carnivorous and non-carnivorous plants with the Droseraceae, Nepenthaceae, Ancistrocladaceae and Plumbaginaceae. This plant is usually encountered as a liana, but in its <b>juvenile</b> <b>phase,</b> the plant is carnivorous. This may be related to a requirement for specific nutrients for flowering.|$|E
25|$|Eggs of C. sapidus hatch in high {{salinity}} {{waters of}} inlets, coastal waters, and mouths of rivers and are {{carried to the}} ocean by ebb tides. During seven planktonic (zoeal) stages blue crab larvae float near the surface and feed on microorganisms they encounter. After the eighth zoeal stage, larvae molt into megalopae. This larval form has small claws called chelipeds for grasping prey items. Megalopae selectively migrate upward {{in the water column}} as tides travel landward toward estuaries. Eventually blue crabs arrive in brackish water, where they spend the majority of their life. Chemical cues in estuarine water prompt metamorphosis to the <b>juvenile</b> <b>phase,</b> after which blue crabs appear similar to the adult form.|$|E
25|$|Size readily distinguishes {{this species}} from most other raptors {{when it is}} seen well. Most other raptors are {{considerably}} smaller. Buteo hawks, which are perhaps most similar to the golden eagle in structure among the species outside of the “booted eagle” group, are often amongst the larger very common raptors. However, a mid-sized Buteo is dwarfed by a golden eagle, as an adult female eagle has a wingspan of about twice the width and weighs around five times more. Buteos are also usually distinctly paler below, although some species occur in “dark morphs” which can be even darker than a golden eagle. Only some Old World vultures and the California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) (among the other raptorial birds this eagle co-exists with) are distinctly larger than the golden eagle, with longer, broader wings, typically held more evenly in a slower, less forceful flight and often have dramatically different color patterns. The turkey vulture (Cathartes aura) is a potential confusion species in North America from a great distance, {{as it is a}} large species that (like the golden eagle) often flies with a pronounced dihedral but is easily separated by its less controlled, forceful flying style and its smaller, thinner body, much smaller head and, at closer range, its slaty black-brown color and silvery wing secondaries. Compared to Haliaeetus eagles, the golden eagle has wings that are only somewhat more slender but are more hawk-like and lack the flat, plank-like wing positioning seen in the other genus. Large northern Haliaeetus usually have a larger bill and larger head which more distinctly protrudes than that of a golden eagle’s in flight. The tail of the golden eagle is longer on average than those of Haliaeetus eagles, appearing to be two or three times the length of the head in soaring flight as opposed to the other eagles where the head is often more than twice the length of the tail. Confusion is most likely between juvenile Haliaeetus and golden eagles since the adult golden has a more solidly golden-brown coloration and all Haliaeetus eagles have obvious distinctive plumages as adults. Haliaeetus eagles are often heavily streaked in their <b>juvenile</b> <b>phase.</b> Juvenile golden eagles can show large patches of white to the wings and tail that are quite different than the random, sometimes large and splotchy-looking distribution of white typical of juvenile Haliaeetus.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Acetabularia {{acetabulum}} {{is a giant}} unicellular green alga whose {{size and}} complex life cycle make it an attractive model for understanding morphogenesis and subcellular compartmentalization. The life cycle of this marine unicell is composed of several developmental <b>phases.</b> <b>Juvenile</b> and adult <b>phases</b> are temporally sequential but physiologically and morphologically distinct. To identify genes specific to <b>juvenile</b> and adult <b>phases,</b> we created two subtracted cDNA libraries, one adult-specific and one juvenile-specific, and analyzed 941 randomly chosen ESTs from them. Results Clustering analysis suggests virtually no overlap between the two libraries. Preliminary expression data also suggests that we were successful at isolating transcripts differentially expressed between the two developmental phases and that many transcripts are specific to one phase or the other. Comparison of our EST sequences against publicly available sequence databases indicates that ESTs from the adult and the juvenile libraries partition into different functional classes. Three conserved sequence elements were common to several of the ESTs and were also found within the genomic sequence of the carbonic anhydrase 1 gene from A. acetabulum. To date, these conserved elements are specific to A. acetabulum. Conclusions Our data provide strong evidence that adult and <b>juvenile</b> <b>phases</b> in A. acetabulum vary significantly in gene expression. We discuss their possible roles in cell growth and morphogenesis {{as well as in}} phase change. We also discuss the potential role of the conserved elements found within the EST sequences in post-transcriptional regulation, particularly mRNA localization and/or stability. </p...|$|R

30|$|Some culturing {{results have}} {{suggested}} {{a new perspective}} on acidification. When we attempt to evaluate the effect of OA on foraminifera, we have to consider (1) that the biological responses to OA differ among different life stages (i.e., gamete, neanic, or mature) and (2) the effect of each carbonate species (i.e., [CO 32 −], [HCO 3 −], and [CO 2]) on shell calcification. Kroeker et al. (2010) reported that the larval and <b>juvenile</b> <b>phases</b> of marine organisms might be more vulnerable to OA. In fact, cultured juvenile Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (sin.) individuals were more affected by reductions in pH than adults (Manno et al. 2012).|$|R
500|$|Gregory Erickson {{and colleagues}} {{have studied the}} growth and life history of tyrannosaurids using bone histology, which can {{determine}} the age of a specimen when it died. A growth curve can be developed when the ages of various individuals are plotted against their sizes on a graph. Tyrannosaurids grew throughout their lives, but underwent tremendous growth spurts for about four years, after an extended <b>juvenile</b> <b>phase.</b> Sexual maturity may have ended this rapid growth phase, after which growth slowed down considerably in adult animals. Examining five Gorgosaurus specimens of various sizes, Erickson calculated a maximum growth rate of about [...] per year during the rapid growth phase, slower than in tyrannosaurines like Daspletosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, but comparable to Albertosaurus.|$|E

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{there are three}} {{successive}} aquatic <b>juvenile</b> <b>phases</b> (egg, larva and pupa) and one adult pupa {{of the life cycle}} of mosquitoes [18]. The duration of the development from egg to adult (1 - 2 weeks) is often compared to the average life span of an adult mosquito (about 3 weeks). The size of the mosquito population is strongly affected by temperature, and the number of female mosquitoes changes accordingly due to seasonal variations [19, 20]. Therefore, it is vital to consider the maturation time of mosquitoes [21], the length of the larval phase from egg to adult mosquitoes, and the impact on the spread of the Dengue virus.|$|R
40|$|Forest trees {{display a}} {{perennial}} growth behavior {{characterized by a}} multiple-year delay in flowering and, in temperate regions, an annual cycling between growth and dormancy. We show here that the CO/FT regulatory module, which controls flowering time in response to variations in daylength in annual plants, controls flowering in aspen trees. However, unexpectedly it also controls the short-day-induced growth cessation and bud set occurring in the fall. This regulatory mechanism can explain the ecogenetic variation in a highly adaptive trait: the critical day length for growth cessation displayed by aspen trees sampled across a latitudinal gradient spanning northern Europe. Trees have extended <b>juvenile</b> <b>phases</b> that can last for decades before the first flower is formed. Trees can also cycl...|$|R
50|$|The black-breasted buzzard is {{striking}} in appearance {{due to the}} distinctive markings of the adult plumage.

From above, the black plumage is broken by a rich mottled red across the back and shoulders. Birds in the immature and <b>juvenile</b> <b>phases</b> of growth display pale brown colouring, with dark to black streaks increasing with age. Chicks have white coloured down, described as ‘hair-like’ on their heads.

Telomerase products with a five nucleotide periodicity were generated. High telomerase activities were detected in all lobster organs. We conclude that telomerase activation is a conserved mechanism for maintaining long-term cell proliferation capacity and preventing senescence, not only in cellular models or embryonic life stages but also in adult multicellular organisms...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The {{object of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the possibilities of tracing aggregational behavior among Bufo boreas boreas larvae with reference to tadpole development, and to attempt to determine what aggregational factors initiate and maintain this behavior.

Field records were taken from three Oregon lakes during the summers of 1965 and 1966. Behavioral patterns were traced through the larval, metamorphic and <b>juvenile</b> <b>phases</b> of development. Temperatures were recorded with a Schultheis centigrade thermometer. Preliminary experiments were conducted to determine the effects of a thermal gradient on tadpole behavior. Aggregational behavior is expressed by these tadpoles throughout all but the first few weeks of the larval phase, through metamorphosis, and into the first season of juvenile life. Aggregational patterns are peculiar to respective developmental stages. Schooling is significant, and the serpentine patterns are unique to these larvae.
