40|$|ObjectiveIt {{has been}} {{reported}} that unmatched adult bone marrow stromal cells could be tolerated by immune-competent allotransplant or xenotransplant recipients under various conditions. This study examined whether xenogeneic bone marrow stromal cells implanted immediately after myocardial infarction can survive and differentiate, attenuating deterioration in left ventricular function. MethodsIn groups I and II (n = 34), myocardial infarctions were created in immunocompetent adult Lewis rats by proximal left coronary artery ligation. In group I, 3 × 106 lacZ-labeled mouse bone marrow stromal cells were immediately injected into the peri-infarct area of the left ventricle, whereas in group II, only culture medium was injected. There were 10 early and 4 late deaths. At 4 weeks after injection, hearts were stained for β-galactosidase and troponin IC. In <b>groups</b> <b>IIIA</b> and IIIB, lacZ-labeled mouse skin fibroblasts were implanted into rat myocardium (n = 10 each) with and without left coronary artery ligation, respectively, and the rats were killed serially. In group IV, animals underwent sham surgery (n = 5, no deaths). At 4 weeks, surviving rats in groups I, II, and IV (n = 10, n = 10, and n = 5, respectively) underwent blinded transthoracic echocardiography for ventricular function studies. ResultsIn group I, labeled mouse-derived bone marrow stromal cells were found within rat myocardium that stained positively for troponin IC 4 weeks after implantation. Functionally, mean left ventricular ejection fraction (P =. 007), stroke volume (P =. 03), and fractional shortening (P =. 02) were all significantly higher in group I than in group II. In <b>groups</b> <b>IIIA</b> and IIIB, mouse fibroblasts induced cellular infiltration with rapid loss of donor cells. No labeled cells were found after 4 days. In group IV, there was no change in cardiac function. ConclusionXenogeneic bone marrow stromal cells implanted into acutely ischemic myocardium induced by coronary artery ligation were immunologically tolerated, survived and differentiated, resulting in a cardiac chimera which improved left ventricular function. This unique immunologic tolerance may suggest the feasibility of using bone marrow stromal cells as universal donor cells...|$|R

The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the curative effects of eliminating sedimentation inside the prostate via manipulation for the treatment of chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) -chronic prostatitis symptom index (CPSI) scores. According to the prostatitis classification standard of the NIH, 721 patients with CPPS were divided into <b>groups</b> <b>IIIA</b> and IIIB by prostatic fluid routine examination (EPSRt) and treated using manipulation. The treatment was performed once per 3 days for 3 - 5 min and 10 treatments were considered to be a period. The EPSRt and NIH-CPSI scores were tested before and at the end of each period following treatment. After 3 treatment periods, the effectiveness and total effectiveness rates of the <b>IIIA</b> <b>group</b> were 72. 3 and 15. 9 %, respectively and those of the IIIB group were 71. 8 and 16. 3 %, respectively.

40|$|Summary: Carica papaya bark has {{contraceptive}} benefits {{when given}} {{at a high}} dose in male rats the mechanism at which it achieves this {{is yet to be}} fully understood. Forty male Wistar rats were used for the study. They were randomized into 8 <b>groups</b> Ia, IIa, <b>IIIa,</b> Ib, IIb, IIIb, IV and V respectively (n= 5). Groups Ia-IIIa and Ib-IIIb were treated for 4 and 8 weeks with Carica papaya bark extract at doses 50 and 100 mg ml - 1 day - 1 comparing to 2 - 5 ml distilled water baseline control. Group IV rats were observed for reversibility treated with alternating bark extract and distilled water for 16 weeks (8 weeks each). They were compared to Group V treated with distilled water alone for similar duration. The rats were sacrificed under chloroform anesthesia. The estimated parameters were testes volumes biochemical activities of testicular antioxidant enzymes and non-enzymes [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) ] as well as total protein (TP). The extract treated groups (Groups Ia, IIa, Ib & IIb) showed a decrease in TP and testicular volume. Also in these groups were significant increases in testicular MDA levels compared to control (<b>Groups</b> <b>IIIa</b> & IIIb). At both durations for the two doses, the extract resulted in a significant decrease in antioxidant enzymes. Animals in the reversibility study group showed values similar to baseline control. In conclusion, Carica papaya leaf extract essentially perturbed the testicular oxidative system this may be responsible for the contraceptive effect seen. Industrial relevance: T he contraceptive benefits of aqueous extract of Carica papaya bark in orally treated male rats had been confirmed. This present study was tailored at reviewing variations in the gonadal proteins and stressors index in male rats administered established contraceptive doses of the extract.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study has been to {{investigate}} the possibility of doping germanium using the technique of ion implantation. Elements from <b>groups</b> <b>IIIa</b> and Va of the periodic table have been used for implantation - namely, gallium, indium, thallium, antimony, and bismuth - together with some "control" implantations with argon and carbon. The majority of implantations were carried out at 70 keV The Rutherford backscattering and channelling technique, using MeV alpha particle has been applied to the implants to determine the gross lattice damage as a function of implantation dose and annealing temperature,, The same technique has been used to determine the position of the implanted atoms within the re-ordered lattice unit-cell following annealing. The electrical effects of the radiation damage (in the case of p-type dopants) and the implanted ions have been determined using the Van der Pauw four point probe technique. The annealing temperature at which implantation damage disappeared was found to be a function of ion dose, for ion doses up to 1014 ions/cm- 2. For higher doses an annealing temperature of it 400 °C was required to restore lattice order" The electrical effects caused by ion implantation were dominated by radiation damage below 400 °C and by the implanted dopants at slightly higher temperatures. The electrical activity of the Implanted ion was also roughly proportional to dose, except at high doses, Rutherford backscattering indicated that the implanted ions were mainly on substitutional lattice sites, in the range 450 °C to 600 °C, with no significant interstitial component.

40|$|Background: Burkholderia cenocepacia is {{the most}} {{prominent}} species of the B. cepacia complex (Bcc), a group of nine closely related and difficult to identify bacteria that cause serious infections in patients with cystic fibrosis. Despite its clinical relevance, identification of B. cenocepacia as a single species is unavailable, as it splits by a widely used recA gene-based PCR identification method into discrete phylogenetic subgroups IIIA, IIIB, IIIC and IIID. With the aim of identifying gene targets suitable for unified detection of B. cenocepacia strains, we examined sequence polymorphisms in the repA and parB genes. These essential genes {{are involved in the}} replication and partitioning of bacterial replicons, hence we also had the opportunity {{for the first time to}} investigate the evolution of the multireplicon (three chromosome) structure of Bcc genomes. Results: Alignment of the repA and parB genes from publicly available Bcc genome sequences enabled the design of primers for their amplification and sequence analysis. Multilocus sequencing typing, a highly discriminatory method for Bcc species and strain discrimination, was used to select strains of unique sequence types (STs) that spanned the known Bcc genetic diversity. Sequence datasets of repA (83 isolates, 67 STs) and parB (120 isolates, 95 STs) genes from the second chromosome were aligned and examined phylogenetically to identify polymorphisms suitable for identification of B. cenocepacia. In contrast to parB, the Bcc repA sequences demonstrated distinct clustering of B. cenocepacia from other species, which enabled the design a species-specific multiplex PCR. The novel single-reaction B. cenocepacia detection method was tested on a panel of 142 different Bcc strains (142 STs) and distinguished recA <b>groups</b> <b>IIIA,</b> IIIB and IIID, from all other Bcc members with 100...|$|R

Alloys with <b>Group</b> <b>IIIA</b> and IVA additions exhibited a single L 12 solid-solution phase with some Kirkendall porosity. At the highest concentration studied, a second phase precipitated with the D 019 (Y), D 022 (Ti) or D 023 (Zr and Hf) structure. Conversely, alloys with Group VA additions exhibited both the L 12 trialuminide phase and a dendritic trialuminide second phase with D 022 structure for all concentrations studied. The solubility limit in the ternary L 12 -type Al 3 (Sc 1 −yXy) phase was high for <b>Group</b> <b>IIIA</b> and IVA metals (almost 12. 5 at. % or y= 0. 5), and much lower for Group VA metals (from about 1. 8 at. % or y= 0. 07 for Ta to about 2. 7 at. % or y= 0. 11 for V). Similarly, the solubility limit of Sc in the non-L 12 phases decreases from the <b>Group</b> <b>IIIA</b> trialuminide to the Group VA trialuminides. The lattice parameter of the L 12 solid-solution decreased linearly with increasing concentration of Group IVA and VA metals, but increased linearly with concentration of Y (<b>Group</b> <b>IIIA).</b> This linear concentration dependence of the lattice parameter is found to correlate with the atomic size mismatch between Sc and the transition metal. The microhardness of the L 12 solid-solution increased linearly with increasing concentration of ternary elements. The concentration dependence of hardness is strongest for Group VA metals and weakest for Group IVA metals, for which a correlation is found with the concentration dependence of lattice parameter. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

Here, the effects of co-administration of zinc and vanadium sulfate on blood glucose levels in diabetic animals were studied. Notably, the study on the effects of the separation of zinc and vanadium has been done previously. Materials &methods: Moderate diabetic hyperglycemia was induced by streptozotocin (STZ) 40 mg/kg, ip injection. Five groups were selected (n= 5), Group I: As normal group, during the trial did not receive any drug treatment and consumed tap water during 45 days. Group II: As control diabetic group, received STZ 40 mg/kg, ip injection and consumed tap water, but they did not receive any drug treatment. The diabetic animals (STZ 40 mg/kg, ip) with 500 - 600 mg/dl blood glucose levels were randomly divided into three groups: <b>Group</b> <b>IIIAs</b> under treatment 1, used drinkable water containing 1 mg/ml of vanadium sulfate.

The {{aim of this}} study was to assess (1) how arterial elastance (E-a), calculated as the ratio of LV end-systolic pressure and stroke volume, relates to arterial properties and leak severity and (2) the validity of E-a/E-max (with E-max the slope of the-end-systolic pressure-volume relation) as a heart-arterial coupling parameter in AR. Methods and Results Our work is based on human data obtained from a study on vascular adaptation in chronic AR. These data allowed us to assess the parameters of a computer model of heart-arterial interaction. In particular, total peripheral resistance (R) and aortic leak severity-expressed as leak resistance (R-L,R-ao) -were quantified for different patient subgroups (group I/IIa/IIb: E-max = 2. 15 / 0. 62 / 0. 47 mm Hg/mL; E-a = 1. 24 / 0. 66 / 0. 90 mm Hg/mL; R = 1. 9 / 0. 6 / 0. 85 mm Hg-s/mL, R-L,R-ao = 0. 35 / 0. 05 / 0. 20 mm Hg-s/mL). A parameter study demonstrated that R-L,R-ao was the main determinant of E-a. With all other parameters constant, valve repair would increase E-a to 2. 81, 1. 08, and 1. 54 mm Hg/mL in <b>groups</b> <b>I,IIa,</b> and IIb, respectively. For a given E-a/E-max, LV pump efficiency (estimated as the ratio of stroke work and LV systolic pressure-volume area) was lower than the theoretical predicted value, except for the simulations with intact aortic valve. Conclusions In AR(a) E-a is determined by aortic leak severity rather than by arterial system properties. Using E-a/E-max as a coupling parameter in general or as a mechanico-energetic regulatory parameter in particular is questionable. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Photomicrographs of the histological sections of Groups II, III and IV rats revealed changes compared to the control group and serum urea levels were significantly higher in these groups. Histological changes observed are consistent with glomerulonephritis and include increased urinary (Bowman's) space, shrinkage and distortion of the glomerular tuft as well as scarring of the glomeruli.

Allyl complexes of groups IA and IIA and low-valent <b>group</b> <b>IIIA</b> and IVA metals are pi-complexes or reactive a-complexes. They show high reactivities toward hydrolysis.

These allylmetals are less reactive toward hydrolysis than toward allylation. The calculated intrinsic kinetic preference of allylation over hydrolysis is found to correlate well with the reactivity of hydrolysis, the nucleophilicity of the allylmetals, and the lateness of hydrolysis transition structures. Both the nucleophilicity of the allylmetal complexes and the thermodynamic driving force are important to the reactivity of hydrolysis. Importantly, there is a large thermodynamic preference for allylation over hydrolysis for all allylmetals because the hydrolysis has to break a strong O-H bond.

Flow cytometry revealed stable, multillinege chimerism in the peripheral blood of euthymic rats (CD 4 +/RT 1 n– 17. 3 % and CD 8 +/RT 11 n– 13. 9 %) and transient chimerism in thymectiomized limb allograft recipients. ConclusionsThymus is necessary for the induction ot donor specific tolerance under ab-TCR/CsA protocol in vascularized composite tissue allograft model. Tolerogenic activity of the thymus resulted in the creation ot stable mixed hematopoietic macrochimeric state within recipient...|$|R
30|$|As {{discussed}} above, {{the decision}} tree divides combined exposures into four <b>groups</b> (I, II, <b>IIIA,</b> and IIIB) These four groups can be graphically depicted by plotting the combined exposures’ values of MCR against the corresponding HI values (an MCR-HI plot). In these plots, MCR values are plotted in a linear scale {{with a minimum}} value of 1 on the vertical axis. Since HI values typically vary over several orders of magnitude, HI values are plotted in log scale and are plotted on the horizontal axis.|$|R
40|$|Background: Preoperative {{determination}} {{of the extent of}} viable residual tumor is an important issue after neoadjuvant treatment. On the other hand, retrospective data suggest that breast-conserving surgery is feasible up to stage IIIA breast cancer without preoperative therapy. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 164 patients who underwent breastconserving surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and/or endocrinal therapy with whole breast radiation between 2005 and 2012. Of those, 116 patients had stages I and II (group 1) breast cancer, whereas 48 patients had stage <b>IIIA</b> (<b>group</b> 2). Results:After a median follow-up of 40. 4 months, 18 (15. 5...|$|R
