40|$|The Saccharomyces cerevisiae <b>Gal</b> 80 protein has two binding partners: <b>Gal</b> 4 and <b>Gal</b> 3.

Galactose triggers an association between <b>Gal</b> 3 and <b>Gal</b> 80, relieving <b>Gal</b> 80 inhibition of <b>Gal</b> 4. We selected for <b>GAL</b> 80 mutants with impaired capacity of <b>Gal</b> 80 to bind to <b>Gal</b> 3 or <b>Gal</b> 4 AD.

40|$|<b>Gal</b> 4 is a prototypical {{eukaryotic}} transcriptional activator whose recruitment {{function is}} inhibited {{in the absence}} of galactose by the <b>Gal</b> 80 protein through masking of its transcriptional activation domain (AD). A long-standing nondissociation model posits that galactose-activated <b>Gal</b> 3 interacts with <b>Gal</b> 4 -bound <b>Gal</b> 80 at the promoter, yielding a tripartite <b>Gal</b> 3 -Gal 80 -Gal 4 complex with altered <b>Gal</b> 80 -Gal 4 conformation to enable <b>Gal</b> 4 AD activity. Some recent data challenge this model, whereas other recent data support the model. To address this controversy, we imaged fluorescent-protein-tagged <b>Gal</b> 80, <b>Gal</b> 4, and <b>Gal</b> 3 in live cells containing a novel <b>GAL</b> gene array. We find that <b>Gal</b> 80 rapidly dissociates from <b>Gal</b> 4 in response to galactose.

When galactose-triggered dissociation is followed by galactose depletion, preexisting <b>Gal</b> 80 reassociates with <b>Gal</b> 4, indicating that sequestration of <b>Gal</b> 80 by <b>Gal</b> 3 contributes to the observed <b>Gal</b> 80 -Gal 4 dissociation. Moreover, the ratio of nuclear <b>Gal</b> 80 to cytoplasmic <b>Gal</b> 80 decreases in response to <b>Gal</b> 80 -Gal 3 interaction.

Based on this result and the striking similarity between the <b>GAL</b> 3 and <b>GAL</b> 1 protein sequences we attempted to detect galactokinase activity that might {{be associated with the}} <b>GAL</b> 3 protein. By both in vivo and in vitro tests the <b>GAL</b> 3 gene product does not appear to catalyze a galactokinase-like reaction. In complementary experiments, Escherichia coli galactokinase expressed in yeast was shown to complement the <b>gal</b> 1 but not the <b>gal</b> 3 mutation. Thus, the complementation activity provided by <b>GAL</b> 1 is not likely due to galactokinase activity, but rather due to a distinct <b>GAL</b> 3 -like activity. Overall, the results indicate that <b>GAL</b> 1 encodes a bifunctional protein. In related experiments we tested for function of the LTA induction pathway in <b>gal</b> 3 cells deficient for other gene functions.

We addressed this through intragenic suppression of <b>GAL</b> 3 C alleles that cause galactose-independent <b>Gal</b> 3 –Gal 80 interaction. We created a new allele, <b>GAL</b> 3 SOC, and showed that it suppressed a new <b>GAL</b> 3 C allele.

Consistent with these in vitro results, an in vivo two-hybrid genetic interaction between <b>Gal</b> 80 p and <b>Gal</b> 4 p (aa 768 to 881) was shown to be weaker in the presence than in the absence of <b>Gal</b> 3 p and galactose.

How <b>GAL</b> 3 and galactose activate <b>GAL</b> 4 is not understood, but the long-standing notion has been that a galactose derivative formed by catalytic activity of <b>GAL</b> 3 is the inducer that interacts with <b>GAL</b> 80 or the <b>GAL</b> 80 -GAL 4 complex. Here we report that overproduction of the <b>GAL</b> 3 protein causes constitutive expression of GAL/MEL genes {{in the absence of}} exogenous galactose. Overproduction of the <b>GAL</b> 1 protein (galactokinase) also causes constitutivity, consistent with the observations that <b>GAL</b> 1 is strikingly similar in amino acid sequence to <b>GAL</b> 3 and has <b>GAL</b> 3 -like induction activity.

Our results, using wild-type, <b>gal</b> 4 -, <b>gal</b> 80 -, and <b>GAL</b> 81 - 1 - yeast cells, {{support the hypothesis that}} control is exerted at the transcriptional level...|$|R

40|$|Normal {{function}} of the <b>GAL</b> 11 gene is required for maximum production of the enzymes encoded by <b>GAL</b> 1, <b>GAL</b> 7, and <b>GAL</b> 10 (collectively termed <b>GAL</b> 1, 7, 10) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Strains bearing a <b>gal</b> 11 mutation synthesize these enzymes at 10 to 30 % of the wild-type level in the induced state. In a DNA-RNA hybridization experiment, the <b>gal</b> 11 effect was shown to be exerted at the transcription level. Yeast cells bearing the <b>gal</b> 11 mutation were shown to grow on glycerol plus lactate more slowly than the wild type. We isolated recombinant plasmids carrying the <b>GAL</b> 11 gene by complementation of the <b>gal</b> 11 mutation. When the <b>GAL</b> 11 locus was disrupted by insertion of the URA 3 gene, the resulting yeast cells (<b>gal</b> 11 ::URA 3) exhibited phenotypes almost identical {{to those of the}} <b>gal</b> 11 strains, with respect to both galactose utilization and growth on nonfermentable carbon sources. Deficiency of <b>Gal</b> 4, the major transcription activator for <b>GAL</b> 1, 7, 10, was epistatic over the <b>gal</b> 11 defect. The <b>Gal</b> 11 deficiency lowered the expression of <b>GAL</b> 2 but not that of MEL 1 or <b>GAL</b> 80; expression of these genes is also known to be dependent on <b>GAL</b> 4 function. We determined the nucleotide sequence of <b>GAL</b> 11, which is predicted to encode a 107 -kilodalton protein with stretches of polyglutamine and poly(glutamine-alanine). An alpha-helix-beta-turn-alpha-helix structure was found in a distal part of the predicted amino acid sequence. A possible role of the <b>GAL</b> 11 product in the regulation of galactose-inducible genes is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Genetics and {{in vitro}} {{studies have shown that}} the direct {{interaction}} between <b>Gal</b> 3 p and <b>Gal</b> 80 p plays a central role in galactose-dependent <b>Gal</b> 4 p-mediated <b>GAL</b> gene expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Precisely how <b>Gal</b> 3 p-Gal 80 p interaction effects induction is not clear. It has been assumed that <b>Gal</b> 3 p interacts with <b>Gal</b> 80 p in the nucleus upon galactose addition to release <b>Gal</b> 80 p inhibition of <b>Gal</b> 4 p. Although <b>Gal</b> 80 p has been shown to possess nuclear localization signal (NLS) peptides, the subcellular distribution of neither <b>Gal</b> 80 p nor <b>Gal</b> 3 p was previously determined. Here we report that <b>Gal</b> 3 p is located in the cytoplasm and apparently excluded from the nucleus. We show that <b>Gal</b> 80 p is located in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Converting <b>Gal</b> 80 p into a nucleus-localized protein (NLS-Gal 80 p) by exogenous NLS addition impairs <b>GAL</b> gene induction. The impaired induction can be partially suppressed by targeting <b>Gal</b> 3 p to the nucleus (NLS-Gal 3 p). We document a very rapid association between NLS-Gal 3 p and <b>Gal</b> 80 p in vivo in response to galactose, illustrating that the nuclear import of <b>Gal</b> 80 p is very rapid and efficient. We also demonstrate that nucleus-localized NLS-Gal 80 p can move out of the nucleus and shuttle between nuclei in yeast heterokaryons. These results are the first indication that the subcellular distribution dynamics of the <b>Gal</b> 3 and <b>Gal</b> 80 proteins play a role in regulating <b>Gal</b> 4 p-mediated <b>GAL</b> gene expression in vivo...|$|R
40|$|During the {{galactose}} {{adaptation period}} of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain bearing a naturally occurring <b>gal</b> 3 allele, we found a longer induction lag and slower rate of accumulation of <b>GAL</b> 10 and MEL 1 RNAs compared to wild-type strains. A strain of genotype <b>gal</b> 3 <b>gal</b> 1 <b>gal</b> 7 is noninducible for MEL 1 gene expression, but this expression block is bypassed by overexpression of the <b>GAL</b> 4 gene or by deletion of the <b>GAL</b> 80 gene, either of which causes a constitutive phenotype. An otherwise wild-type strain that bears a chromosomal <b>gal</b> 3 gene disruption mutation does not produce wild-type <b>GAL</b> 3 RNA and exhibits induction comparable to a strain bearing the naturally occurring <b>gal</b> 3. Based on this array of results, we conclude that the <b>GAL</b> 3 gene product executes its function at a point before <b>GAL</b> 4 mediated transcription of the <b>GAL</b> 1 - 10 - 7 and MEL 1 genes. Thus, the data {{are consistent with the}} previously advanced hypothesis that the <b>GAL</b> 3 gene product functions to synthesize the inducer or coinducer molecule. In experiments in which the presence of either the plasmid-carried cloned <b>GAL</b> 3 gene or the plasmid-carried cloned <b>GAL</b> 1 - 10 - 7 genes allows MEL 1 induction of a <b>gal</b> 3 <b>gal</b> 1 <b>gal</b> 7 cell, we find that loss of the plasmid results in the shutoff of MEL 1 expression even when galactose is continuously present. Either <b>GAL</b> 3 function or <b>GAL</b> 1 - 10 - 7 functions are therefore required for both the initiation and the maintenance of the induced state. Since the strains bearing either the naturally occurring <b>gal</b> 3 allele or the <b>gal</b> 3 disruption (null) allele do induce, the plasmid loss experiments indicate the existence of two completely independent induction initiation-maintenance pathways, one requiring <b>GAL</b> 3 function, the other requiring <b>GAL</b> 1 - 10 - 7 function. Finally, Northern blot analysis reveals two major <b>GAL</b> 3 transcripts that differ in size by approximately 500 nucleotides...|$|R
