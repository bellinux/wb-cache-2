5|$|Each of the game's worlds feature eight main levels, with a boss {{appearing}} {{at the end}} of every fourth and eighth level. Hidden throughout each of these levels are five Flowers and twenty Red Coins, the latter of which are hidden behind specific coins in each level. Collecting Flowers adds flowers to the gate {{at the end of}} each level (not including boss levels). If the player manages to land on an open flower after jumping through the <b>end</b> <b>gate,</b> they can play a bonus game during which they can earn extra lives or bonus items that can be activated from the pause menu, such as additional stars or maginifying glasses that reveal the location of hidden Red Coins. At the end of each level, players receive a score based on how many Flowers and Red Coins they found, as well as how many stars they have remaining, with a maximum score of 100 awarded for finding all Flowers and Red Coins and ending the level with 30 stars. Completing all levels in a world with a score of 100 unlocks two additional levels for that world.|$|E
500|$|The Eastern District Post Office {{is based}} at {{the eastern end of}} Whitechapel Road, on the south side. This was the eastern {{terminus}} for the former London Post Office Railway (colloquially known as the [...] "Mail Rail"), built to allow fast mail transfers across London. It closed in 2003. [...] Beyond this is Mile <b>End</b> <b>Gate</b> – where the road becomes Mile End Road; and was the site of the former toll gate.|$|E

It becomes Mile End Road at {{the eastern end of}} Whitechapel Road, at Mile <b>End</b> <b>Gate,</b> the former toll gate for the turnpike, passing Stepney Green tube station, with Stepney to the south, and then Mile End tube station. Next, it becomes Bow Road, passing Bow Road tube station and Bow Church DLR station.|$|E
5000|$|GooBall is a Mac {{computer}} game by Over The Edge Entertainment, now Unity Technologies, {{and published by}} Ambrosia Software. In the game, the player assumes {{the role of an}} alien stranded on Earth. [...] "Goober", as the alien becomes known to the CIA, is stuck inside a life support device made of protoplasm (hence the title). The gameplay is similar to the Super Monkey Ball series in that the player tilts the environment, which causes Goober to roll around in it, collecting gems and making his way to the <b>end</b> <b>gate.</b> Unlike in Super Monkey Ball, however, Goober can stick to surfaces by holding down the command key.|$|E
50|$|The real-life mascot for the Western Bulldogs is {{a four-month}} old bulldog named Caesar. He {{can be seen}} walking around the {{perimeter}} of the ground prior to the game. He then waits for the players to come out on the ground; they give him a pat as they run past to the banner. Sid, the club's previous real-life mascot, officially retired his club jumper at Etihad Stadium on 6 May 2017 and was given a lap of honour for his seven years of service to the Western Bulldogs. During home games, Caesar has a reserved area at the Footscray <b>End</b> (<b>Gate</b> 7), where fans can come and give him a pat and have their photo taken.|$|E

5000|$|Oren Safdie {{originally}} planned {{to become an}} architect like his father Moshe Safdie. He obtained a master of architecture degree, attending the Graduate School of Architecture at Columbia University in New York. This was an attempt, he explained, [...] "to get closer to my dad." [...] During his final semester there, he took an elective playwriting course and was hooked on it after winning a competition run by the Columbia Dramatists. He wrote a 10-minute scene, drawing on his experience at Columbia presenting a design to a jury of critics, which involved three ego-driven architects and one student. This eventually became Private Jokes. He stayed another four years at Columbia and completed an MFA in Fiction Writing. Safdie was awarded a Woolrich Fellowship, and founded The West <b>End</b> <b>Gate</b> Theatre, a student theater company that included actors like Oscar nominee Ethan Hawke and The Whole Nine Yards actress Amanda Peet. He became a playwright-in-residence at La MaMa back in 1996, and he produced the first ever Canadian Theatre Festival in New York.|$|E

50|$|In 1908, Edison {{introduced}} Amberol Records {{which had}} a playing time of just over 4 minutes. The process of making the finished record {{was the same as}} the Gold Molded records, however a harder wax compound was used. In 1912, celluloid was used in place of wax, and the name was changed to Blue Amberol, as the dye was a blue color. The master was recorded and then the process of making the mold was the same as the Gold Molded process. What is different is that a steam jacketed mold with an air bladder in the center was used. Celluloid tubing was put in the mold and the <b>end</b> <b>gate</b> was closed. The rubber bladder expanded the celluloid {{to the side of the}} heated mold, and printed the negative record in positive on the celluloid. The bladder was then deflated, and cold air was used to shrink the tubing so the celluloid print could be removed. The printed tubing was put in a plaster filler. When the plaster was hard the cylinders were then baked in an oven, then the ribs made on the inside of the plaster with knives. The records were cleaned and then packaged.|$|E

Volume inversion {{is included in the}} solution of Poisson’s equation, hence the subsequent I-V formulation automatically captures the volume-inversion effect. Analysis of electrostatic potential in the body of MG MOSFETs provided a model equation for short-channel effects (SCE). The extra electrostatic control from the <b>end</b> <b>gates</b> (top/bottom gates) (triple or quadruple-gate) is also captured in the short-channel model.|$|R

5000|$|In 1993, {{bass player}} Michael Bitz joined, {{replacing}} Vattel Cherry, {{who had taken}} over from original bassist Victor Rice soon after Mephiskapheles got started, in early 1991. Cherry left to tour with avant-garde saxophonist Charles Gayle. In late 1994, Mephiskapheles released its debut album, God Bless Satan, produced by Bill Laswell and Robert Musso. Originally released on the band's own label Pass The Virgin, it saw wider release after being licensed by Moon Ska Records starting in 1995. A video the band produced for the song [...] "Doomsday" [...] began receiving airplay on MTV around this time. Earlier, in its demo form, the song had been widely heard on television in New York as the soundtrack to a fitness-center commercial. Mephiskapheles was among the bands that regularly attracted capacity crowds to Wetlands during the New York City nightclub's golden era in the mid-1990s. Other New York City clubs where Mephiskapheles headlined, during its 1990s rise, included S.O.B.'s, New Frontier, New Music Café, The Cooler, Tramps, Palladium, Bond Street, Cat Club, Lone Star Café, West <b>End</b> <b>Gate,</b> Pyramid Club, Kenny's Castaways, Café Wha?, Nightengales, and Tilt.|$|E
5000|$|Some of {{the police}} later claimed that they were fired on first by IRA sentries, but this has never been proved. Correspondents for the Manchester Guardian and Britain's Daily News interviewed eyewitnesses, and {{concluded}} that the [...] "IRA sentries" [...] were actually ticket-sellers: It is the custom at this football ground for tickets to be sold outside the gates by recognised ticket-sellers, who would probably present the appearance of pickets, and would naturally run inside at the approach of a dozen military lorries. No man exposes himself needlessly in Ireland when a military lorry passes by. The police in the convoy's leading cars appear to have jumped out, chased these men down the passage to the Canal <b>End</b> <b>gate,</b> forced their way through the turnstiles, and started firing rapidly with rifles and revolvers. Ireland's Freeman's Journal reported that, The spectators were startled by a volley of shots fired from inside the turnstile entrances. Armed and uniformed men were seen entering the field, and immediately after the firing broke out scenes of the wildest confusion took place. The spectators made a rush for the far side of Croke Park and shots were fired over their heads and into the crowd.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Criminal Justice, Washington State UniversityPrisons can {{no longer}} be an <b>end</b> <b>gate</b> to incarcerate and {{incapacitate}} people who have broken the law. As exemplified by The Serious and Violent Offender Reentry Initiative (SVORI), Washington State Institute for Public Policy (WSIPP), and Washington States Senate Bill 6157, prisons must repair and prepare offenders for a successful return to their communities. With the backdrop of the nothing works retributive paradigm, rising incarceration rates, and revolving door syndrome, the emergence of evidenced based practices introduces a new paradigm that offers an alternative management and intervention system for prison administration. Evidenced based practices reduce reoffending while supporting corrections goals of safety and security. The implementation of evidenced based practices within the current correctional paradigm of retribution is complex and challenging. Introducing and upholding this new rehabilitative paradigm is dependent upon a systemic, cognitive restructuring of the criminal justice system, specifically prisons. Prisons must undergo a cultural shift in balancing control management and coercion with rehabilitation. This conflict between the two paradigms has resulted in a precarious tipping point for research-based implementation and the ability to achieve sustainability while avoiding paradigm paralysis. This process evaluation analyzes the transition of a large male (2035 inmate) multi- custody level prison from a traditionally managed facility into a Therapeutic Community (Right Living) Reentry Center. The current study will expand on the limited research available on actual day-to-day organizational development, collaboration, and therapeutic community implementation. The purpose is twofold: (1) to examine the implementation of an evidenced based practice in a prison-based reality, and (2) identify the sustainability of the model in the current prison paradigm. This evaluation is important because it demonstrates why evidenced based practices proven effective in changing criminogenic behavior and reducing recidivism struggle for sustainability within prisons. Results indicate that utilization of sound implementation processes and evidenced based practices will not be sustained unless implemented within a system-wide integrated model. When the mission and goals of the organization identify offender change practices as extrinsic and not intrinsic to correctional goals, alternative management and therapeutic systems will continue to be expendable, and therefore unsustainable.
