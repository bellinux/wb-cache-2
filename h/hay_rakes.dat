2500|$|Traditional hay {{making in}} the Boho was a {{communal}} endeavour. Neighbours of the farmer and his family would gather round to help [...] "win" [...] the hay before any sign of rain. This was a long and arduous job compared to the modern process. Local people might even {{take a day off}} their regular job for this sole purpose. The meadow was cut using a scythe (originally), and then in more modern times by tractor with a side-mounted mower blade. The grass swathes would be turned over by means of a hay rake and if the grass was dry enough it would be [...] with a pitchfork. The person that was tedding would lift as much as he/she could with a pitchfork and then shake it out vigorously over the ground. Once the grass was dry enough, the loose hay would be gathered into rows with <b>hay</b> <b>rakes</b> (this tedding might be repeated depending on how dry the grass was). The rows could also be made into small [...] "laps" [...] or [...] "lappins" [...] which are circularised stacks of dried grass. The invention of a hay-right or tedding machine connected to the power take-off (PTO) of a tractor made tedding a lot less labour-intensive.|$|E

50|$|Spangler {{was granted}} a patent on a grain {{harvester}} in 1887. He invented certain new and boring improvements such as the sliding tailboard made of sheet metal. He removed a standard tailboard and provided the sliding tailboard to regulate {{the width of the}} platform and adjust it to grain of different length. He also installed guards that prevented straw or grain from wrapping around the roller.Spangler invented a combined <b>hay</b> <b>rake</b> and tedder which was patented in 1893. By his peculiar arrangement, he was able to provide a combined <b>hay</b> <b>rake</b> and tedder in one machine, thereby reducing the cost. He formed a company for its sale which was unsuccessful and short-lived.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with the}} {{prominent}} tractor division, IH also sold several {{different types of}} farm-related equipment, such as balers, cultivators, combines (self-propelled and pull behind), combine heads, corn shellers, cotton pickers, manure spreaders, <b>hay</b> <b>rakes,</b> crop dusters, disk harrows, elevators, feed grinders, hammer mills, hay conditioners, milking machines, planters, mills, discs, plows, and miscellaneous equipment.|$|E
50|$|Also, the Tribes had {{long-established}} trade networks, {{which led}} to successful freighting businesses. Nickerson requested sturdy wagons, and while some of those supplied proved inadequate, tribal operations used 80 wagons by 1881 (as well as 7 mowing machines and 5 sulky <b>hay</b> <b>rakes</b> and many smaller implements). By August 1889, 20 tribal teams worked year-round to supply both private and commercial needs in the rapidly growing county.|$|E

5000|$|A windrow is {{a row of}} cut (mown) hay {{or small}} grain crop. It is allowed to dry before being baled, combined, or rolled. For hay, the windrow is often formed by a <b>hay</b> <b>rake,</b> which <b>rakes</b> <b>hay</b> that has been cut by a mowing machine or by scythe into a row, or it may {{naturally}} form as the hay is mown. For small grain crops which are to be harvested, the windrow is formed by a swather which both cuts the crop and forms the windrow.|$|R
50|$|Its {{distinctive}} {{feature is the}} arrangement of the lower stretcher between the legs as a double-ended Y-shape. The shape of each end, and their joinery, was based on traditional English craft woodworking and the construction of wooden <b>hay</b> <b>rakes.</b> The stretcher is not merely a simple Y shape, but its junction is braced by a T-shaped joint, as was needed for the work of a rake. Some modern reproductions simplify this to a plain Y, abandoning the design's original roots.|$|E

Warder and Bushnell managed the factories in Springfield, which covered 20 acres. The company opened a branch office in Chicago in 1865, headed by Glessner, which grew to become its most profitable: in 1871, the Chicago office sold about 800 machines; in 1884, it sold 25,000 machines. By 1886, the company employed more than 1000 workers, and was exporting to foreign countries. In 1908, the 2,000,000th Champion machine was sold.|$|E
5000|$|By 1888, JS was {{receiving}} royalties {{from the company}} of $1 per machine in which one of his patents were used. Numerous companies in the seeder cultivator industry were also paying a higher royalty for using Rowell patents including the Van Brunt Seeder Manufactory in Horicon, Wisconsin which was later purchased in 1912 by a firm that would be acquired by John Deere. Rowell also invented the [...] "Force Feed" [...] for grain drills, harrows, <b>hay</b> <b>rakes,</b> fanning mills, and Tiger Threshing machines. Sales of these machines were throughout the Midwest, Canada, Germany, South America, Russia, to which many Rowell Tiger Threshers were sold, and South Africa. He has built {{up one of the}} largest manufactories of the state, and gained for himself a comfortable fortune, with the factory employing more than 200 employees. Among the assets of the firm were 6 pedigreed trotting horses, including Badger Girl a champion trotter. The book value of these horses was placed at $4,200 in 1889, with their market value being higher. One large distributor was the Northwestern Implement Company in St. Paul, Minnesota, which was acting agent for the firm for Minnesota, the Dakotas, and Montana to sell Rowell seeders, <b>hay</b> <b>rakes,</b> grain drills, and threshing machinery. Total orders accepted, shipped, and settled from this one distributor for 1887 was $72,822.47.|$|E

To meet such a last purpose, the study adopts the life cycle assessment methodology carefully quantifying the impact indicators for three different categories, i. e. human health, ecosystem quality and resource depletion. The results highlight a global environmental impact reduction of about 35 %. The proposed system represents an effective and competitive improvement to ease and speed the haymaking process and to reduce the environmental impact of such a key farmer activity...|$|R
50|$|A <b>hay</b> <b>rake</b> is an {{agricultural}} rake {{used to collect}} cut hay or straw into windrows for later collection (e.g. by a baler or a loader wagon). It is also designed to fluff up the hay and turn it over so that it may dry. It is also used in the evening to protect the hay from morning dew. The next day a tedder is used to spread it again, so that the hay dries more quickly.|$|R
5000|$|The name John S. Rowell, {{founder and}} {{president}} of the J. S. Rowell Manufacturing Company, makers of the Tiger Seeders and Grain Drills, <b>hay</b> <b>rakes,</b> and cultivators, should occupy a high place in the list of inventors of practical agricultural implements. Like a number of men of his time, he achieved success in the agricultural implement world with no opportunity other than those produced by his own efforts. In addition to founding the JS Rowell Manufacturing Company, he was also one of the 1881 incorporators and a Director of the Beaver Dam Cotton Mills, as a founding incorporator and director of the Beaver Dam Malleable Iron Works which grew to titanic proportions, Beaver Dam Electric Light Company, and President of the Old National Bank in Beaver Dam from 1896 until his death in 1907.|$|E
5000|$|In 1869, John Stoddard {{then began}} the {{manufacture}} of agricultural implements in partnership with John Dodds, under the firm name of John Dodds & Company. The Farmers Friend Manufacturing Company was incorporated as a stock company in 1871 as producers of high class agricultural implements constituting a complete line of planting, harvesting and tilling machinery under the Farmers Friend, Excelsior, Monarch brands. This was succeeded by J. W. Stoddard & Company and in turn, in 1884, was incorporated as the Stoddard Manufacturing Company, of which Stoddard was the president and principal stockholder. Their distinctive brand of [...] "Tiger" [...] was a mark of excellence in agricultural machinery the world over. The chief implements made by the Stoddard Manufacturing Company were mowers, <b>hay</b> <b>rakes,</b> press drills, and disc harrows. The best known of these were the famous Tiger Rake, Tiger Harrow, and Havana Press Drill. More than 200,000 of the Tiger Rake had been sold by 1890.

50|$|Huber {{established}} {{his role in}} the modernization of American agriculture when he invented a “revolving hay rake” (patented in 1863) that allowed one man to do in three hours what three men could do in a day. Relocating to Marion, Ohio, Huber patented his <b>hay</b> <b>rake</b> and began a full line of agricultural implements. Huber's production lines ran only in second to that of Cyrus McCormick, the inventor of the McCormick reaper. Huber also began to build and market affordable steam tractors, and was the first producer of modern gasoline-powered tractors.|$|R
50|$|The typical early horse-drawn <b>hay</b> <b>rake</b> was a dump rake, a wide two-wheeled {{implement}} with curved {{steel or}} iron teeth usually operated from a seat mounted over the rake with a lever-operated lifting mechanism.

50|$|<b>Hay</b> can be <b>raked</b> into rows {{as it is}} cut, {{then turned}} {{periodically}} to dry, particularly if a modern swather is used. Or, especially with older equipment or methods, the hay is cut and allowed to lie spread {{out in the field}} until it is dry, then raked into rows for processing into bales afterwards. During the drying period, which can take several days, the process is usually sped up by turning the cut hay over with a <b>hay</b> <b>rake</b> or spreading it out with a tedder. If it rains while the hay is drying, turning the windrow can also allow it to dry faster. However, turning the hay too often or too roughly can also cause drying leaf matter to fall off, reducing the nutrients available to animals. Drying can also be sped up by mechanized processes, such as use of a hay conditioner, or by use of chemicals sprayed onto the hay to speed evaporation of moisture, though these are more expensive techniques, not in general use except in areas where there is a combination of modern technology, high prices for hay, and too much rain for hay to dry properly.|$|R
5000|$|A {{great number}} of {{haymaking}} songs have been recorded in Lithuania. They are also subcategorized into <b>hay</b> mowing and <b>raking</b> songs. Many songs combine both topics. <b>Hay</b> <b>raking</b> songs are more melancholy than the mowing songs, and they often contain imagery about an orphan girl. Other songs describe all of the tasks associated with haymaking, beginning with the mowing and ending with the feeding of the hay to the animals. Haymaking songs often personify a clover or other beautifully blossoming flower, and often contain references to love. Young peoples' feelings are expressed through {{the images of the}} haymaking process. For example, the song [...] "Ein bernelis per lankelę" [...] (There goes a lad through the field) tells of a brother working in the field with a steel scythe. He plans to mow the clover and adorn his hat with it before enticing the young maiden. In contrast to these love songs are songs focusing on the topic of war. They ruefully sing of the brother who must go off to the great war. Many songs tell off the rounding up of recruits, which shows that these songs are from {{the first half of the}} 19th century.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the method of}} derivation of mathematical description of a cam orbit in rotary <b>rakes</b> (<b>hay</b> aggregators). At first, the authors describe basic construction elements of the rotary <b>hay</b> <b>rake</b> mechanism and their mutual links and relationships. Thereafter, they define the origin and {{the orientation of the}} system of coordinates, in which all calculations are carried out. In the next step they define basic requirements concerning the assurance of an optimum functioning of cam mechanisms as well as their transformation into mathematical equations. These requirements represent a base for the mathematical formulation of an optimum transition curve and it is emphasized that an optimum formulation of parameters of this curve is very important. In the course of calculation, they use also a normalized transition curve, which is used for the optimizations {{of the total number of}} parameters of the transition curve. Thereafter, they take into account mechanical and operational parameters of the hay aggregators and convert the optimum transition curve to that part of the space curve, which agrees at best with these parameters. Finally, the whole cam orbit is constructed using individual segments and presented as a sequentially defined space curve. Its individual parts concur sequentially to the level of the second derivation and are described as explicit mathematical functions of mechanical and operational parameters of the hay aggregator. The definition of the system of coordinates, the execution phase of calculations and the final shape of the cam orbit are illustrated in graphs...|$|R
