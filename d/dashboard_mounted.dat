50|$|The {{automatic}} transmission gear selector is <b>dashboard</b> <b>mounted,</b> thereby freeing up the flat floor {{space between the}} front seats, allowing movement to the back seat from inside the vehicle.|$|E
5000|$|Electric {{controls}} {{are the most}} expensive and only come as <b>dashboard</b> <b>mounted</b> switches. The disadvantage of these systems, is that the control is either on or off, and thus controlling the load by feathering is not an option.|$|E
50|$|A {{combination}} {{steering lock}} and ignition key was fitted to the steering column, which replaced the <b>dashboard</b> <b>mounted</b> ignition switch and charismatic push button starter. A new steering column was {{fitted with a}} collapsible section {{in the event of}} an accident.|$|E
5000|$|A tilbury is a light, open, two-wheeled carriage, with {{or without}} a top, {{developed}} in the early 19th century by the London firm of Tilbury, coachbuilders in Mount Street (see also Stanhope (carriage)). A tilbury rig {{is little more than a}} single [...] "tilbury seat" [...] - the firm's characteristic spindle-backed seat with a curved padded backrest - [...] mounted over a raked luggage boot, and fitted with a <b>dashboard</b> and <b>mounting</b> peg, all on an elaborate suspension system of curved leaf springs above the single axle.

50|$|The third {{generation}} Espace arrived in December 1996, {{with the long}} wheelbase Grand Espace coming to market {{in the beginning of}} 1998. The most notable feature of the Espace III was the radically futuristic interior (including an elongated and centrally <b>mounted</b> <b>dashboard,</b> digital speedometer and radio/CD display). The Espace III featured a plastic (GRP) body over a galvanised independent steel chassis.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, {{the second}} {{generation}} of the Eurovans was launched. The 807 itself was launched in June, followed by the C8 in July. The floorpan, wheelbase, and postponement were not transformed, but all exterior dimensions, including front and rear tracks, were increased. The increase in length of almost 30 cm greatly enhanced interior volume. The new Eurovans were afforded a much more bubbly, contemporary look, along with a modern looking <b>dashboard</b> with centrally <b>mounted</b> gauges.|$|R
50|$|The {{custom built}} Backseat Driver telemetery and data {{acquisition}} system was first used this year. It was a <b>dashboard</b> <b>mounted</b> unit with a rudimentary on-board LED display, and entirely through-hole based circuit board with a remote mounted accelerometer and telemetry radio.|$|E
50|$|Mell Kilpatrick {{began work}} as a {{photographer}} for the Santa Ana Register in 1948, taking photos for insurance evidence including documenting car crashes for the Highway Patrol. To help capture photographs early on scene he developed the first <b>dashboard</b> <b>mounted</b> camera. Killpatrick's unique perspective on death with his photography innovation {{caught the attention of}} Walt Disney.|$|E
50|$|Also notable was {{a fourth}} place finish by Clarence Lovell, This was Lovell's best career finish, and his only {{finish in the}} top five of a NASCAR Cup race. Lovell would die five days later on May 11, in a single vehicle truck {{accident}} which occurred while he was trying to change a tape in a <b>dashboard</b> <b>mounted</b> tape deck.|$|E
50|$|Accident {{investigators}} from the National Transportation Safety Board were {{dispatched to the}} accident to determine the cause. In a press conference on November 17, NTSB member Mark Rosekind stated that the float started crossing the tracks after the warning bells and lights had been activated and while the crossing gate was lowering. The flashing lights and bell had begun 20 seconds before the train entered the intersection, and 7 seconds later the gate began to come down. It was one second after that (12 seconds before impact) that the float began crossing the track. The train sounded its horn 9 seconds before the collision; seconds later the engineer also activated the train's emergency brake. The NTSB based these conclusions on video evidence from a <b>dashboard</b> camera <b>mounted</b> on an escorting police cruiser, a forward-mounted camera on the train, and the train's data recorder.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} Somerset interior contained two {{close fitting}} front seats, finished in leather, {{which could be}} arranged as a bench seat and a large deeply cushioned rear bench seat which could accommodate three passengers. With a centrally <b>mounted</b> <b>dashboard</b> or instrument panel, Austin incorporated a four speed, plus reverse, gearbox into the car's design which was controlled by a column mounted gear change lever. Four wheel, foot operated hydraulic brakes and a handbrake operating on the rear wheels only provided the car's stopping power.|$|R
50|$|Defiance, a fast {{touring car}} on the 40 hp chassis was {{exhibited}} at Olympia's 1912 Motor Show. It is delivered ready for the road with hood, screen, Austin-Sankey detachable wheels, dynamo and lamps. The CAV dynamo projects through the aluminium <b>dashboard</b> from its <b>mounting</b> on an aluminium bridge over the flywheel. It is driven by a counter shaft taking its drive from the camshaft. The Automotor Journal described Defiance as having a Torpedo body.Defiance had been developed from the 40 hp for the 2,000 mile trial held by the Automobile Club of Russia and run from St Petersburg to Riga and Moscow. It was given a streamlined body, a tapered bonnet and a radiator with rounded edges. It performed well. At St Petersburg over the flying kilometre carrying three people, two spare wheels, spare parts and luggage it was timed at 28 seconds, more than 80 miles an hour.|$|R
50|$|The {{computer}} vision system utilises an unobtrusive <b>dashboard</b> <b>mounted</b> camera and two infra-red illumination sources to detect and track the facial features of the operator. The system analyses eye closures and head poses to determine early onset of fatigue and distraction. The fatigue detection algorithm calculates AVECLOS. This is the percentage of time the eyes are fully closed during a one-minute interval.|$|E
5000|$|According to {{data from}} {{independent}} retail analysts GfK, <b>dashboard</b> <b>mounted</b> digital cameras aka [...] "Dash cams" [...] became the fastest growing area in consumer electronics, in 2015, with sales increasing by 395%. Of this market, Nextbase’s range of dash cams now {{accounts for more than}} 68 per cent by volume and 73 per cent by value according to more recent GfK stats from March 2016.|$|E
5000|$|The Austin America {{was sold}} in the US, Canada and Switzerland between 1968 and 1972. This two-door version of the car {{featured}} a [...] 1275 cc engine. Various modifications were made to suit the US market including an [...] "anti-pollution air injection system", a split circuit braking system, rocker switches in place {{of some of the}} <b>dashboard</b> <b>mounted</b> knobs, a [...] "hazard warning system" [...] and flush door locks.|$|E
50|$|The master {{cylinder}} is located behind the driver’s side <b>dashboard</b> <b>mounted</b> on the vacuum booster. The pressure {{inside of the}} {{master cylinder}} is created by a primary and secondary piston. These are pushed by the output rod of the vacuum booster to compress fluid within its primary and secondary chambers (hydraulic pressure). The hydraulic pressure is translated through the brake lines to the brake calipers. When the brake fluid is pushed through the brake lines, the master cylinder chambers are replenished by the reservoir (attached {{to the top of}} the master cylinder).|$|E
50|$|The Limousine {{was based}} on the floorpan of Jaguar's 420G {{flagship}} (not {{to be confused with the}} smaller Jaguar 420), but with a wheelbase extended an extra 21 in. The frontal styling was similar to the original Daimler Sovereign, with the Jaguar four-headlight treatment first seen on the 420G's predecessor, the Mark X, mated to a Daimler radiator grill bearing the traditional fluting. Jaguar Mark X/420G underpinnings were also apparent from the twin ten gallon fuel tanks set in each of the rear wings, each with its own electric SU pump selected by a <b>dashboard</b> <b>mounted</b> switch.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>dashboard</b> <b>mounted</b> screen calculates {{the fuel}} savings {{to that of}} a {{gasoline-powered}} Equinox. It also includes a kilowatt meter and a fuel cell energy display. The fuel cell has four vapor outlets that replace the exhaust pipe. Three carbon-fiber fuel tanks store up to a maximum of 9.25 pounds (4.2 kg) of gaseous hydrogen at 10,000 psi (70 MPa), and give the Equinox a range of 200 mi. The Equinox Fuel Cell is certified by the EPA as a zero-emission vehicle (ZEV). GM built 115 Chevrolet Equinox Fuel Cell vehicles and deployed them in 2007-2008 in several target areas including New York and California as part of a comprehensive plan dubbed [...] "Project Driveway".|$|E

5000|$|Autoblog.com {{reviewed}} the C3 Aircross, giving a mostly negative review to aspects and {{features of the}} vehicle. The basic X model launched with no airbags, ABS, or temperature sensor; the last of which {{they consider to be}} a necessity in the hot Latin American climate. They criticised the boot, calling it awkward and complicated since it can only open once an arm carrying the spare tyre has been unlocked and swung out of the way, which increases the space required for parking. Further, in their review, they complained that the <b>dashboard</b> <b>mounted</b> displays were difficult for the driver to see comfortably, echoing concerns CNET had when reviewing the C3 Picasso, where they called the displays [...] "not particularly readable" [...] and possibly dangerous to use while driving.|$|E
5000|$|The {{popularity}} of both four-track and eight-track cartridges grew from the booming automobile industry. In September 1965, Ford Motor Company introduced factory-installed and dealer-installed eight-track tape players {{as an option}} on three of its 1966 models (Mustang, Thunderbird, and Lincoln), and RCA Victor introduced 175 Stereo-8 Cartridges from its RCA Victor and RCA Camden artist's catalogs. By the 1967 model year, all of Ford's vehicles offered this tape player upgrade option. Most of the initial factory installations were separate players from the radio (such {{as shown in the}} image), but <b>dashboard</b> <b>mounted</b> 8-track units were offered in combination with an AM radio, as well as with AM/FM receivers. Muntz, and a few other manufacturers, also offered 4/8 or [...] "12-track" [...] players that were capable of playing cartridges of either format, 4-track or 8-track. With the backing of the US automakers, the eight-track format quickly won out over the four-track format, with Muntz abandoning it completely by late 1970.|$|E
50|$|The fourth {{revision}} of the third-generation Legacy, introduced during 2001, made several important but subtle changes {{to the front of}} the car. The fenders, grille, and headlights were altered slightly, making interchangeability with A-C type impossible. The headlights in the Japanese market kept using HID bulbs as in previous years, but the shape on the headlight was altered slightly. The grille was made slightly taller than the A-C models, and the shape of the bumper around the grille was altered slightly to accommodate a lower joint where the hood and bumper meet. Consistent with previous models, the HID headlights had a <b>dashboard</b> <b>mounted</b> adjustment switch that allowed the driver to re-aim the headlights to reduce glare to approaching traffic, although the switches were altered slightly internally to adjust for the increase in power needed to adjust the new style headlights. The bonnet became a lighter aluminum alloy, similar to that available on the STI's at the time. Compression and timing changed in order to further reduce the effect of loss of boost during the switch over from the primary to secondary stages. The ECU also got an upgrade, it is now tunable by the manufacturer or third party tuning workshops. Additional optional extras were offered upon purchase including but not limited to; a new body kit, head light surrounds, and 4-pot brakes - the stock wheels were designed to accommodate this upgrade. The D-Type Legacy is Subaru's best shot at the sequential twin turbo engine besides the STI revision.|$|E
5000|$|Gear sticks {{are most}} {{commonly}} {{found between the}} front seats of the vehicle, either on the center console (sometimes even quite far up on the dashboard), the transmission tunnel (errorenously called a console shifter when the floor shifter mechanism is bolted to the transmission tunnel with the center console {{to cover up the}} shifter assembly when used with a rear or front wheel drive vehicle), or directly on the floor. Some vehicles have a column shift where the lever is mounted on the steering column—this arrangement was almost standard practice in American vehicles from about 1939 until relatively recently. It had the added benefit of allowing for a full width bench-type front seat (though some models with bucket seating as an option include it). It has since fallen out of favor, although it can still be found widely on North American-market pick-up trucks, vans, emergency vehicles (both law enforcement and EMS - the column shifter is retained where a floor shifter is unfeasible due to mounting the mobile data terminal and 2-way radio), and [...] "full-size" [...] US sedans such as the Ford Crown Victoria. A <b>dashboard</b> <b>mounted</b> shift was common on certain French models such as the Citroën 2CV and Renault 4. Both the Bentley Mark VI and the Riley Pathfinder had their gear lever {{to the right of the}} right-hand drive driver's seat, alongside the driver's door, where it was not unknown for British cars to also have their handbrake. (Left-hand drive models received a column shift.) ...|$|E
50|$|The Ami Super was a flat-4 variant {{powered by}} the engine of the GS and {{produced}} between 1973 and 1976.At {{the launch of the}} GS, its original flat four-cylinder air-cooled 1015 cc 55 bhp DIN engine was considered to be underpowered. With surplus engines available, Citroën decided to fit the engine into the Ami 8 in January 1973. The car, which became the Ami Super, then easily reached 140 km / h. From the outside, it had a new front grille with six additional vents underneath. On the sides of the front wing there was a badge marked 1015 in reference to the new engine. The body {{is the same as the}} Ami 8 apart from changes to inner front wings, bonnet, front panel and bumper mountings. The chassis was also modified from the standard Ami 8 with alterations made to accommodate the 1015 cc engine. Other changes included thicker wire in the suspension springs, to give a tauter ride and front anti-roll bars. Rear anti-roll bars were fitted from 1974 onwards until the end of Ami Super Production in 1976. The Ami Super and Ami 8 Break (Estate) were fitted with 135 15 ZX Michelin tires as standard while the Ami 8 Berline retained the Michelin 125 15 X although 135 15's could be ordered as an option. Also on the Ami Super headlamps with built in Quartz iodine fog lights were offered as an option, other options included heated rear screens. Inside, the gear change is floor mounted, in place of the <b>dashboard</b> <b>mounted</b> gear lever of the Ami 6 and 8 and to accommodate this the hand brake of the Super curves up instead of down. The speedometer was also specific to the Ami Super differing slightly to allow higher speed numbers to be shown.|$|E
40|$|A new lane {{detection}} and following technique is proposed which using the Hough transform extracts small linear segments from images acquired from a <b>dashboard</b> <b>mounted</b> camera system.

40|$|A new Hough {{transform}} based {{technique for}} the automated detection and tracking of road contours {{on high speed}} (i. e. low curvature) roads is presented. Given a scene acquired from a <b>dashboard</b> <b>mounted</b> camera system, the road contours of the current lane in the near eld of view are automatically detected and tracked. Parameter space search optimisations and tracking strategies are outlined.

40|$|Dashcams are small, <b>dashboard</b> <b>mounted</b> camera {{systems that}} {{continuously}} monitor {{the area around}} a vehicle and record video images on a portable storage device. According to many data protection authorities, dashcams constitute surveillance systems that are operated by private individuals in public places. By continuously acquiring personal data they interfere disproportionately with the right of informational self-determination. One approach to make dashcams compliant to data protection law is to automatically identify personal information – at least pedestrian’s faces and license plates – in the captured video image and subsequently disguise them. Even though appropriate anonymization methods exist, high computational costs prevent their use in portable dashcams. This article presents a new approach that enforces the anonymization of encrypted dashcam videos on a dedicated computer system, before the user gets access to the videos. To accomplish this, classified images are safeguarded by usage control techniques on {{the way from the}} camera to the anonymization component. By applying the developed system, any existing dashcam can ultimately be enhanced by privacy protection capabilities...|$|E
40|$|Augmented Reality (AR) is {{technology}} {{that provides a}} view of real world environment with which has augmented or virtual components. In this thesis I explore how AR {{can be used for}} in-vehicle applications. AR systems can be used for navigation applications, combining this with capabilities like monitoring of data relevant to the driver could be a powerful tool for in vehicle assistance in automobiles. Some research is being done on using AR in automobiles for in-vehicle assistance using different technologies like see-through head mounted displays (HMD) or using projectors to use the windshield as a see through, heads up display (HUD). With all the research being done on AR display technologies in vehicles, a concern that arises is the possibility of the AR components distracting the driver from their normal driving activities. Less research has been done on comparing between different AR display types. For my master thesis, I investigated the effectiveness of three technologies to show AR content: • using an HMD similar to Google Glass • using the Windshield as a display • using a <b>dashboard</b> <b>mounted</b> console Based on the results of the study, {{it was found that the}} Windshield based AR HUD was superior over the fixed console based HDD (AR Lens) and the Head Mounted Display. The Windshield Display performed superior to the other displays in terms of ratio of number of navigational errors, maintaining the speed limit and ability to detect objects in the surrounding. It was also preferred by the subjects over the other displays. The AR Lens performed relatively average in the test study and performed higher than the HMD for most of the tests. The HMD showed comparatively better results than the AR Lens in maintaining the speed limit but was the least preferred by most of the participants...|$|E

Purpose: This study {{investigated}} the effects of visual and auditory secondary tasks on the driving performance of young and old participants with simulated visual impairment and those experiencing age-related declines in visual attention. Methods: Twenty eight participants comprising two age groups (younger, M= 27. 3 years; older M= 69. 2 years) drove around a closed road circuit under both single and dual task conditions. Measures of driving performance included detection and identification of road signs, detection and avoidance of large low contrast road hazards, gap judgment, lane keeping and time to complete the course. Performance was assessed for two levels of visual impairment compared to a baseline condition. Visual impairment was simulated using goggles designed to replicate the effects of cataracts and blur; all participants had binocular visual acuity greater than 6 / 12 when wearing the goggles and satisfied the visual requirements for driving. The secondary task required participants to verbally report the sums of pairs of numbers presented either through a computer speaker (auditorally) using computer-generated files or via a <b>dashboard</b> <b>mounted</b> monitor (visually) while driving. Results: Visual impairment significantly reduced driving performance (p< 0. 05) and these differences were greatest for the cataract condition. Multi-tasking further exacerbated the effects of visual impairment, where the visual dual task had a greater detrimental effect on driving performance than the auditory dual task (p< 0. 05), particularly for the older drivers. Conclusions: Multi-tasking (for example, talking on a mobile phone or using in-vehicle navigational devices) had a significant detrimental impact upon driving performance and these effects were exacerbated for older drivers and for those with simulated visual impairment. The implications of these findings are far reaching in modern society where the driving and in-vehicle environments are becoming increasingly complex and the elderly comprise the fastest growing segment of the driving population...|$|E
