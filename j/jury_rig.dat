25|$|On {{graduating from}} Oxford, Baker was briefly a school master at Whitgift School in Croydon, before emigrating to New Zealand in 1873. He sailed to New Zealand {{on board the}} SS Dallam Tower. The ship {{eventually}} reached Port Chalmers, New Zealand, after a dramatic voyage in which she lost a mast and travelled 2,000 miles under a <b>jury</b> <b>rig.</b>|$|E
25|$|Minotaur took Neptuno in tow at 3.30 am {{the next}} day, and at {{daylight}} work began to clear away {{the wreckage of}} battle. As the storm rose, the towline snapped, putting Neptuno in danger of running onto a lee shore and being wrecked. The battered mainmast collapsed on 22 October, smashing through the captain's cabins below the poop, crushing to death Spanish paymaster Diego de Soto as he slept, and killing one of the British prize crew. Now completely dismasted the crew struggled {{to shore up the}} decks to prevent them from collapsing, and tried to <b>jury</b> <b>rig</b> sails.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in {{the absence}} of the captains further acts of mutiny had taken place on the other ships. One officer was drowned; others loyal to the Batavian Republic were beaten up. The Batavian flag was torn up by the mutineers. British {{officers}} restored order with some difficulty. After the surrender the Prince visited several of the ships to receive the cheers of the mutineers. He had now hoped to take command of the surrendered fleet himself, but this was denied by the British. The crews were taken off the ships, and British prize crews sailed them to England. Only five derelict frigates lying in Den Helder were handed over to William. These were manned with volunteer crews of the old-regime Dutch navy, living in the vicinity, and under <b>jury</b> <b>rig</b> sailed to England in November. One of these frigates foundered with loss of life.|$|E

2500|$|On 16 October 1957, on {{a voyage}} between New York City and Liverpool, No.8 piston rod {{in the engine}} snapped. The ship was about [...] off Halifax at the time. The weather deteriorated, and the ship was rolling, making repairs difficult. To {{stabilize}} Rakaia, {{it was decided to}} <b>jury</b> <b>rig</b> a set of sails. Tarpaulin sails were made from hatch covers. Two square sails and one staysail were erected, giving approximately [...] of sail. The engine was reduced from [...] eight to six cylinders, running at a maximum of 50rpm; it took eleven days to reach Liverpool.|$|E
2500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 19 August the Guerriere made contact with the Constitution. Dacres prepared to fight and the two ships closed and exchanged broadsides for some time. The range eventually decreased and after a brief close exchange the Guerrieres mizzenmast was shot away, allowing the Constitution to rake her several times, causing considerable damage, before the two ships became entangled. Shortly after this Guerriere lost both her main and foremasts, leaving her largely un-manoeuvrable. During the engagement Dacres had been wounded by a musket-ball in the back while on the starboard forecastle, but had refused to leave the deck. Constitution then drew away to repair some damage, while Dacres attempted to set a <b>jury</b> <b>rig.</b> The attempt failed, and on Constitutions returning, Dacres fired {{a shot in the}} opposite direction to the Constitution. Sensing that this was an attempt to signal surrender, Hull ordered a boat to take a lieutenant over to the British ship. When the lieutenant walked onto the Guerriere and asked if Guerriere was prepared to surrender, Captain Dacres responded [...] "Well, Sir, I don't know. Our mizzen mast is gone, our fore and main masts are gone-I think on the whole you might say we have struck our flag." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{made our}} way north. A breeze sprang up, and about noon all the boats came {{together}} for the last time. I had no mast or sail in mine, but I made a mast out of a spare oar and hoisted a boat-awning for a sail, with a boat-hook for a yard. She was certainly over-masted, but I had the satisfaction of knowing that with the wind aft I could beat the other two. I {{had to wait for}} them. Then we all had a look at the captain's chart, and, after a sociable meal of hard bread and water, got our last instructions. These were simple: steer north, and keep together as much as possible. 'Be careful with that <b>jury</b> <b>rig,</b> Marlow,' said the captain; and Mahon, as I sailed proudly past his boat, wrinkled his curved nose and hailed, 'You will sail that ship of yours under water, if you don't look out, young fellow.' He was a malicious old man--and may the deep sea where he sleeps now rock him gently, rock him tenderly to the end of time! ...|$|E

50|$|On 15 September 1806, {{while under}} <b>jury</b> <b>rig</b> some 15 miles off Havana, she {{encountered}} HMS Anson, under Captain Charles Lydiard. Anson, mistakenly believing Foudroyant distressed, attacked, and was driven off.|$|E
50|$|Although {{ships were}} {{observed}} to perform reasonably well under <b>jury</b> <b>rig,</b> the rig {{was quite a}} bit weaker than the original, and the ship's first priority was normally to steer for the nearest friendly port and get replacement masts.|$|E

50|$|Jury rigging {{is the use}} of {{makeshift}} repairs or temporary contrivances, {{made with}} only the tools and materials that happen to be on hand, originally in a nautical context. On square-rigged sailing ships, a <b>jury</b> <b>rig</b> is a replacement mast and yards (a yard is a spar to which a sail is attached) improvised in case of damage or loss of the original mast.|$|E
50|$|Both {{ships were}} flush deck {{with only a}} <b>jury</b> <b>rig,</b> and could only operate as coastal service vessels. The Admiralty, {{although}} impressed with Coles' rotating turret, required oceangoing vessels to protect its worldwide empire. Unfortunately for Coles, engine technology had not yet caught up with his designs and consequently oceangoing ships required sails. Combining rigging, masts, and turrets proved complicated if rigging was not to impede the turrets' arcs of fire.|$|E
50|$|Willaumez lingered a {{while in}} the hope that the convoy might still be yet to come, but in the night of 19 to 20 August, his fleet {{sustained}} a hurricane that damaged most of the ships. Foudroyant, having lost both her rudder and her masts, managed to limp back to Havana on <b>jury</b> <b>rigging,</b> but was intercepted and attacked by HMS Anson; as she had retained her full firepower, Foudroyant drove her opponent away within half an hour despite her lack of manoeuvrability, and entered harbour.|$|R
50|$|Early {{models were}} almost as notable for their <b>jury</b> <b>rigged</b> {{appearance}} {{as they were}} for their girth and conspicuous V8 engine.

The distributor was cumbersomely situated {{directly in front of the}} seat and there were numerous other finish flaws. Also, the large radiator was conspicuous for its boxiness and lack of ornamentation on such an otherwise curvy and stylish machine.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} think of kludges and quick fixes as {{innovative}} practices, characterized by the re- appropriation of available resources in order to adapt them to specific needs.

We believe that rearrangements of materials may re-signify our experiences and reinvent everyday life, disclosing potentials of resistance and emancipation. The political and aesthetic dimensions of this practice of the unusual and unexpected are dealt with through the articulation of works by Michel de Certeau, John Dewey, Jacques Rancière and Hannah Arendt...|$|R

50|$|Stag Hound's crew {{raised a}} <b>jury</b> <b>rig</b> and reached California in 113 days (108 days at sea and 5 days in port), {{a very fast}} time for a partly {{dismasted}} vessel.

The entire round-the-world voyage earned a profit of $80,000 in 1851 U.S. dollars, which was enough to inspire {{the construction of a}} fleet of California clippers in future years.|$|E
50|$|The {{jury mast}} knot (or {{masthead}} knot) is traditionally used for <b>jury</b> <b>rigging</b> a temporary mast on a sailboat or ship {{after the original}} one has been lost. The knot is placed {{at the top of}} a new mast with the mast projecting through the center of the knot. The loops of the knot are then used as anchor points for makeshift stays and shrouds. Usually small blocks of wood are affixed to, or a groove cut in, the new mast to prevent the knot from sliding downwards.|$|R

During the night, the ships built <b>jury</b> <b>rigs</b> and resumed the pursuit the next day, when HMS Dryad and HMS Achates intervened. The helpless Clorinde struck after the first cannon shot from Dryad, who towed her to Portsmouth.|$|R
5000|$|Ships {{typically}} {{carried a}} number of spare parts (e.g., items such as topmasts), but the lower masts were too large to carry spares, at up to 1 meter (3 ft 3 in) in diameter. So a jury mast could be various things. Ships usually carried a variety of spare sails so <b>rigging</b> the <b>jury</b> mast, once erected, was mostly a matter of selecting appropriate size. Contemporary drawings and paintings show {{a wide variety of}} <b>jury</b> <b>rigs,</b> attesting to the creativity of sailors faced with the need to save their ships.
