5|$|Although phumdi {{vegetation}} {{has existed}} for centuries, {{it was not until}} 1886 that the Manipur Gazetteer recorded that wetlands with floating islands were used by inhabitants for fishing. Before the Itahi barrage was constructed in 1986, 207 khangpoks (huts or sheds) were reported on the phumdis, but after the dam was completed in 1999, the Loktak Development Authority (LDA) reported 800 such structures. Many of the huts are reported to have been converted into permanent dwellings and about 4,000 people live in these floating huts, earning their living as fishermen. The huts are constructed using plastic ropes, heavy rocks, wood, bamboo, zinc plates and iron rods. Athapums, artificial circular phumdis, which were built by the villagers as enclosures for <b>fish</b> <b>farming,</b> are present on the lake, and this aquaculture has caused further proliferation of the phumdis. A tourist lodge has been built on one of the phumdis in Sandra Island.|$|E
40|$|Aquaculture {{has become}} one of the fastest growing food {{industries}} in the world. Like many other industries, aquaculture, and especially <b>fish</b> <b>farms</b> may cause negative effects on the environment, such as eutrophication, which is recognised as a major threat to aquatic ecosystems. In this thesis such effects are studied in a number of lakes and Baltic coastal areas. The ecosystem scale in focus is an entire lake or defined coastal area in the size range 0. 5 - 25 km 2. One important aim is to develop practically useful models that estimate the eutrophication effects as a function of <b>fish</b> <b>farm</b> load. Such models should be useful for the licensing authorities when giving permissions for <b>fish</b> <b>farms.</b> It was concluded that <b>fish</b> <b>farms</b> might increase the surface water concentrations of total and dissolved phosphorus, total nitrogen and chlorophyll in lakes. Furthermore, traditional models overestimate the <b>fish</b> <b>farm</b> impact on lakes. Therefore, new models especially valid for <b>fish</b> <b>farm</b> emissions in lakes were developed. A method to assess the sensitivity of coastal areas to an increased organic load from, e. g., <b>fish</b> <b>farms</b> was developed. Moreover, models to predict the enhanced phosphorus and chlorophyll-a concentrations and the decreased Secchi depth caused by <b>fish</b> <b>farms</b> were developed for coastal areas in the Åland archipelago. From extensive field studies in the Åland archipelago it was concluded that <b>fish</b> <b>farms</b> could cause increased total phosphorus concentrations, periphytic growth and phytoplankton biomass. However, those effects were generally only observed in small and semi-enclosed bays. Finally, the sediment quality beneath coastal <b>fish</b> <b>farms</b> was found to be a key parameter for the water quality, as well as for the recovery time after closure of <b>fish</b> <b>farms...</b>|$|R

50|$|The 1980s {{also saw}} {{saltwater}} and freshwater <b>fish</b> <b>farms</b> come into operation. Much of their production was exported. An experimental <b>fish</b> <b>farm</b> {{was scheduled to}} open in the 1990s at Meneou, near Larnaca.|$|R
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, 76–77 {{per cent}} of output by value was {{livestock}} farming and, although this {{has fallen to}} about 64 per cent since 1990, arable farming remains {{a minority of the}} sector and two-thirds of agricultural land is rough pasture. One result is that chemicalisation and arable-based subsidies have had less impact on Scottish biodiversity than is the case in England where farming is overwhelmingly arable. The UK membership of the European Economic Community (later the European Union) in 1972 began a re-orientation for Scottish farming. A preference for Commonwealth markets was replaced by EU obligations. Agriculture became dominated by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EU, which made farming dependent on market support and direct grants to farmers. As a result, some sectors, particularly hill sheep farming, became viable only with subsidies. Eight-four per cent of Scottish land qualified for extra support as a Less Favoured Area (LFA), but 80 per cent of the payments were going to only 20 per cent of the farmers, mainly large commercial arable farms in the Lowlands. A series of reforms to the CAP from the 1990s attempted to control over-production, limit incentives for intensive farming and mitigate environmental damage. As part of an attempt to mitigate the depopulation and commercialisation of Scottish farming, the Crofting Act of 1976 made it easier for crofters to buy their farms, but most were insufficient to support a family, and many small farmers turned to <b>fish</b> <b>farming</b> and tourism to supplement their incomes. A dual farm structure has emerged with agriculture divided between large commercial farms and small pluralised and diversified holdings. Scotland has the highest average farm size in the European Union, almost ten times the average.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} <b>fish</b> <b>farm</b> biodeposition on benthic bacteria, thraustochytrid protists, and heterotrophic protozoa (nanoflagellates and ciliates) in an oligotrophic area of the Mediterranean Sea. The <b>fish</b> <b>farm</b> impact was investigated both on a seagrass (Posidonia oceanica) bed and on soft bottom sediments. In both systems, sediment samples were collected with a multicontrol sampling strategy (i. e., beneath the <b>fish</b> <b>farm</b> and at three control sites per system). The uneaten food pellets supplied to the fish determined the accumulation of sediment organic matter and the enhancement of protein content in impacted sediments (both seagrass bed and soft sediments). In both systems, the abundance and biomass of heterotrophic protists increased significantly beneath the <b>fish</b> <b>farm,</b> but {{the structure of the}} protist assemblages responded differently in vegetated and unvegetated sediments. Thraustochytrid abundance increased significantly in impacted seagrass. These results provide evidence that the structure of protist assemblages respond significantly to <b>fish</b> <b>farm</b> biodeposition and indicate that the monitoring of these benthic components provides complementary information for the assessment of the <b>fish</b> <b>farm</b> impact on the benthic systems...|$|R

40|$|The Gulf of Aqaba {{represents}} a small scale, easy to access, regional analogue of larger oceanic oligotrophic systems. In this Gulf, the seasonal cycles of stratification and mixing drives the seasonal phytoplankton dynamics. In summer and fall, when nutrient concentrations are very low, Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus are more {{abundant in the}} surface water. This two populations are exposed to phosphate limitation. During winter mixing, when nutrient concentrations are high, Chlorophyceae and Cryptophyceae are dominant but scarce or absent during summer. In this study it was tried to develop a simulation model based on historical data to predict the phytoplankton dynamics in the northern Gulf of Aqaba. The purpose is to understand what forces operate, and how, to determine the phytoplankton dynamics in this Gulf. To make the models data sampled in two different sampling station (<b>Fish</b> <b>Farm</b> Station and Station A) were used. The data of chemical, biological and physical factors, are available from 14 th January 2007 to 28 th December 2009. The <b>Fish</b> <b>Farm</b> Station point was near a <b>Fish</b> <b>Farm</b> that was operational until 17 th June 2008, complete closure date of the <b>Fish</b> <b>Farm,</b> about halfway through the total sampling time. The Station A sampling point is about 13 Km away from the <b>Fish</b> <b>Farm</b> Station. To build the model, the MATLAB software was used (version 7. 6. 0. 324 R 2008 a), in particular a tool named Simulink. The <b>Fish</b> <b>Farm</b> Station models shows that the <b>Fish</b> <b>Farm</b> activity has altered the nutrient concentrations {{and as a consequence}} the normal phytoplankton dynamics. Despite the distance between the two sampling stations, there might be an influence from the <b>Fish</b> <b>Farm</b> activities also in the Station A ecosystem. The models about this sampling station shows that the <b>Fish</b> <b>Farm</b> impact appears to be much lower than the impact in the <b>Fish</b> <b>Farm</b> Station, because the phytoplankton dynamics appears to be driven mainly by the seasonal mixing cycle...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to monitor {{nutrient}} enrichment around a <b>fish</b> <b>farm</b> site in Igoumenitsa Bay (NW Greece). Seasonal samples were collected from the waters and benthos surrounding <b>fish</b> <b>farms</b> in Igoumenitsa Bay, NW Greece. The study {{was carried out in}} Igoumenitsa bay between May 2011 and Dec 2012). Seawater samples were collected every month from different sampling sites which were: the open Ioanian sea, 60 meter south and North of the <b>fish</b> <b>farms</b> {{as well as in the}} water adjucent to the floating cages. The waters surrounding the <b>fish</b> <b>farms</b> exhibited profound increased mean annual content of phosphorus, which peaked during the summer months. This increase in phosphorus was also reflected in high primary productivity as indicated by increased chl-a content at the sites of the <b>fish</b> <b>farms.</b> A model of dispersion of wastes generated by the <b>fish</b> <b>farms</b> indicates that the major path of dispersion is towards the coast and over a range of more than 120 meters. The directions and velocity of water currents may result in the diffusion of nutrient from point sources such as the <b>fish</b> <b>farms</b> towards deepest part of the bay (South). The results indicate that benthic ecosystem around the <b>fish</b> <b>farms</b> is not significantly disturbed. Nevertheless, the levels of nutrients in the water body and the AZTI's marine biotic index (AMBI) of the sampling points indicate a potential ecological risk during the summer period. Increased feeding and metabolism of the <b>farmed</b> <b>fish</b> during the growing season is combined with the natural seasonal hydrological conditions and result in a highly localized aquaculture induced eutrophication.

40|$|In {{the context}} of the COBO project (funded by EU FP 6), {{consequences}} of a <b>fish</b> <b>farm</b> activity on biogeochemistry composition and processes of bottom sediments below the <b>fish</b> <b>farm</b> cages have been evaluated. The <b>fish</b> <b>farm</b> was located in a northern fjord (Loch Creran, Scotland). The study was carried out three months after the removing of the cages. Seven cores in May and three cores in August 2006 were collected to study early diagenesis processes and to calculate benthic fluxes. Each core was extruded; pore waters were extracted and analyzed for nutrients (NH 3, NO 3, NO 2, PO 4, Si(OH) 4, and TCO 2), metals (Fe and Mn) and sulphates; diffusive fluxes at the sediment-water interface were calculated by applying Ficks first law. Preliminary results show sediments lying down to the <b>fish</b> <b>farm</b> were characterized by more intensive early diagenesis processes (from 2 to 4 times more than blank area). This means the <b>fish</b> <b>farm</b> produce high reactive organic matter snow that increases the reactivity of bottom sediments. Seasonal variations with increased diagenetic processes in summer were also recorded. In spring and in summer sediments both from the impacted area and the control sites were affected by strong bio-irrigation processes. Calculated benthic fluxes reflect the early diagenesis patterns with more intensive nutrient fluxes to the overlying water in the <b>fish</b> <b>farm</b> affected area and in the summer season, this suggests sediments affected by <b>fish</b> <b>farm</b> activity contribute more to eutrophication of confined coastal waters...|$|R
