40|$|Abstract: A kind {{of ground}} source heat pump {{incubator}} which absorbs {{the heat of}} soil as heat source of incubator was designed in this paper. The heating condenser was improved and optimized by adopting the three-level distributed heating way, and avioded the high temperature radiation influence on hatching egg in traditional <b>electric</b> <b>incubator.</b> In addition, the temperature field of incubator had good uniformity and the power consumption of temperature equilibrium was effectively reduced. It was better to stimulate the embryonic development by utilizing continuous variable temperature bionic hatching mode, and the growth adaptability of poults was improved as well. Hatching experiments showed, the main performance indexes of ground-source heat pump incubator meet the relevant national standards, the hatchability of fertilized eggs is above 91. 4 % and the rate of healthy poults is above 97. 9 %；The whole energy-saving rate of incubator is about 60 % to 65 %, reducing CO 2, SO 2 and dust emissions, thus the effect of energy saving and emission reduction is remarkable, and achieved good social and economic benefits...|$|E
40|$|Hatching {{performance}} of eggs of two broiler parent stocks {{was investigated in}} three different seasons of the year under Bangladesh conditions. Two strains of broiler breeder flocks were reared separately on floor from 22 to 48 weeks of age and eggs laid by these birds during spring, summer and monsoon were considered for this study. Each season was treated as treatment with 4 sets, each of 50 eggs as replicates within a treatment. One thousand two hundred hatching eggs (600 from Starbro and 600 from ISA MPK) were incubated in a James-way forced-draft <b>electric</b> <b>incubator</b> and the required records were kept during incubation and following taking out of hatches. The results of the experiment showed that hatching {{performance of}} eggs from Starbro was significantly better in spring than those observed during summer and monsoon. The hatchability results from ISA MPK also showed trends similar to Starbro but data {{did not differ significantly}} among seasons of the year. It may be concluded from the study that it is better to consider hatching of large number of eggs during spring if the broiler parents are reared in open-sided house...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{study to}} {{determine}} the effect of pre-incubation storage of the eggs of the Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) was conducted during the cool harmattan season in the north-east arid region (Sahel) of Nigeria. Eggs were collected daily from six-months-old quail and stored at room temperature (25 - 29 C) for 0 to 20 days before incubation in an <b>electric</b> <b>incubator.</b> Eggs that failed to hatch were opened foro determination of fertility and estimation of time of death of embryos. A total of 196 (29. 3 %) eggs out of 668 incubated hatched successfully. The length of pre-incubation storage was negatively correlated (r =- 0. 91; P < 0. 0001) with hatchability. The highest hatchability (72. 3 %) was obtained from eggs that were not stored (Day 0 of storage). Hatchability dropped sharply after storage for 9 days. No egg hatched following pre-incubation storage of over 11 days. Among the unhatched eggs, there were significantly more apparently infertile than fertile eggs (P < 0. 0002). There was no relationship between pre-incubation length of storage and the proportion of embryos that died in early, middle or late incubation period. However, the proportion of the apparently infertile eggs increased with increasing length of pre-incubation storage (r = 0. 95; P < 0. 0001). No egg stored for 18 days or more was found to be apparently fertile. It was concluded that the length of pre-incubation storage has detrimental effect on hatchability of quail eggs in the Sahel area and that quail eggs for incubation should not be stored at room temperature for more than 9 days, even in the coolest season...|$|E

40|$|PROGRESS in the {{determination}} of causes of embryo mortality seems to be dependent in a measure upon accurate knowledge of the metab olism of the developing embryo. A {{review of the literature}} of this subject is given by Needham (1). EXPERIMENTALMETHOD The Bronze turkey eggs used in this experiment were produced at the Western Kentucky Experiment Substation at Princeton, Kentucky. They were collected for a period of thirteen days, shipped to Lexington, Ken tucky, and placed in an <b>electric</b> (Petersime) <b>incubator.</b> The average tem perature was 99. 75 Â°F. throughout the period of incubation with a relative humidity of 64 per cent. All eggs were turned four times daily. At twenty-four hour intervals, six eggs weighing 80 to 90 grams each were removed and stored in a refrigeration room at 28 to 30 Â°F. This effectively stopped embryonic development and preserved the eggs until analyzed at a later date. The embryos were removed from the eggs, compared with previously standardized specimens, freed of all adhering yolk, including that within the body cavity, dried on filter paper, transferred to silica dishes, weighed, and dried to a constant weight in an electric oven at 100 C. Â°The dry em bryos were burned to a white ash, which was dissolved in hydrochloric acid, made to a definite volume with distilled water, and calcium and phosphorus determined in separate aliquots. Calcium was determined by the McCrudden volumetric method (2) and phosphorus by the volumetric method of the Association of OfficialAgricultural Chemists (3).

40|$|The bird's egg {{consists}} of about forty per cent of fat. The largest {{portion of the}} fat {{is found in the}} egg yolk. In addition to this, during incubation period some fat is synthesized from protein and some possibly from carbohydrate molecules. All this fat is utilized for nutrition and energy supply of the developing embryo and of the young bird after hatching. Among the earliest workers with avian eggs Parke (1866) noticed that the amount of fat in the egg yolk diminishes during incubation. Then Eaves (1910), Sakuragi (1917), Idzumi (1924) and Murray (1926) showed experimentally that as the actual amount of fat de creases in a whole egg, it increases in an embryo. Needham (1925 and 1927) in his reviews of the literature pointed out that the fat in an egg is the most important energy-source of the developing embryo. The above facts would suggest that the egg fat is of such chemical composition that it can be utilized according to the need of the embryo. The process of absorption of fat, particularly of yolk fat, also gives another aspect of the question. It looks very much as if there is a preferential absorption of the unsaturated acids by the embryo at certain stages of incubation (Eaves, 1910). The present paper {{consists of}} a further experimental study of the fat metabolism of the chick embryo under standardized or â€œ¿normalâ€• conditions of artificial incubation, that is, changes of the amount and chemical nature of fat in the embryo and egg yolk as measured by the iodine value, saponification number and refractive index. METHODS AND MATERIALS All eggs used were from a flock of White Leghorn hens (Gallus domesticus). The eggs were selected for uniformity of size and quality of eggshell (Romanoff, 1929). The incubation was carried on in a special <b>electric</b> laboratory <b>incubator</b> (Romanoff, 1929 a) under the conditions already described (Romanoff, 1930) with the temperature 38. 0 Â± 0. 20 C., and the relative humidity 60. 0 Â ± 1. 0 per cent...|$|R
40|$|Poultry {{production}} is a lucrative business in Nigeria but inadequate hatchery machines limit the expansion and make poultry products for instance day old chicks more expensive. At the moment, few commercially owned poultry hatcheries in Nigeria are located distance {{far away in}} the western and Eastern parts of the country. Majority of these hatcheries {{have little or no}} access to the national grid system but operate at about 60 per cent below the installation capacity. Generally, environmental pollution, unreliability and lack of access to grid power supply and low performance efficiency characterize the condition of the poultry hatchery business powered by conventional energy supply in Nigeria. These hamper and adversely affect the establishment of medium to large scale poultry production outfits in the rural areas of the country. But with the advent of <b>electric</b> powered egg <b>incubator</b> technology in poultry production, poultry farmers in Nigeria are likely to incubate and hatch poultry eggs and breed day-old chicks under a sustained power supply in a clean environment. Therefore, this study was aimed at the design, developed and tested in order to provide a favourable environment for eggs hatching. The developed machine was tested to assess its performance. The results from the test showed that out of the total 25 eggs, 5 eggs hatched after operating the machine. This gives 33 % hatchability. The result...|$|R
40|$|Electric fields, {{which are}} {{generated}} by the movement of charged ions across membranes, are found in all biological systems and can influence cellular components ranging from amino acids to biological macromolecules. Physiological field strengths range from 1 – 200 mV/mm, and these electric fields are especially elevated at sites of cellular growth during development and regeneration. It has previously been demonstrated that elevated electric fields induce alignment of astrocyte processes in vitro, enhancing the rate of neurite outgrowth. It is believed that electric fields of varying physiological strength affect other astrocytic responses associated with regeneration. To characterize the duration over which these changes emerge, cultured rat astrocytes were exposed to different direct-current electric field strengths. The resulting cellular behaviors were recorded every three minutes with an inverted microscope equipped with DIC optics and a stage <b>incubator.</b> <b>Electric</b> fields were found to induce astrocyte responses similar to those observed during periods of neurodevelopment and regeneration. Changes in astrocyte movement, proliferation, 2 ̆ 6 morphology emerged within the first hour and persisted {{through the course of}} the electric field application, leading mammalian astrocytes to revert to an earlier maturation state resembling those seen in amphibian astrocytes associated with central nervous system regeneration. Collectively, these results suggest that applied electric fields lead to astrocyte dedifferentiation, with certain electric field strengths eliciting and enhancing specific cell responses...|$|R
