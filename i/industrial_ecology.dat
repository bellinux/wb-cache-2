5|$|In recent years, {{concepts}} {{based on}} (re-)cycling resources are increasingly gaining importance. The most prominent among these concepts {{might be the}} Circular Economy, with its comprehensive support by the Chinese and the European Union. There is also {{a broad range of}} similar concepts or schools of thought, including cradle-to-cradle laws of ecology, looped and performance economy, regenerative design, <b>industrial</b> <b>ecology,</b> biomimicry, and the blue economy. These concepts seem intuitively to be more sustainable than the current linear economic system. The reduction of resource inputs into and waste and emission leakage out of the system reduces resource depletion and environmental pollution. However, these simple assumptions are not sufficient to deal with the involved systemic complexity and disregards potential trade-offs. For example, the social dimension of sustainability seems to be only marginally addressed in many publications on the Circular Economy, and there are cases that require different or additional strategies, like purchasing new, more energy efficient equipment. A review of a team of researchers from Cambridge and TU Delft identified eight different relationship types between sustainability and the circular economy, namely a (1) conditional relation, a (2) strong conditional relation, a (3) necessary but not sufficient conditional relation, a (4) beneficial relationship a (structured and unstructured) (5) subset relation, a (6) degree relation, a (7) cost-benefit/trade-off relation, and a (8) selective relation.|$|E

Despite this, ports continue to be the primary economic resource and a decisive source of employment in Europe. In today’s port expansion and development, the awareness of a need for new strategies is taking hold: it is no longer enough to investigate ways of regaining urban spaces abandoned by port activities, rather it has become necessary to explore the variety of design approaches through which a port survives and coexists with the city. New trends confirm that port areas, facing global and local challenges, are experimenting with shared use of land and resources, and realizing the potential of the “port-city-territory. ” In this sense it’s possible conceive port systems as logistical landscapes within which concepts such as the development of positive <b>industrial</b> <b>ecologies,</b> the increase of intermodal infrastructure, and the integration of dynamic port logistics provide fundamentals to realize the ideal of “planning the city with the port. ...|$|R

40|$|High-technology {{biofuels}} pose many {{risks to}} the environment and to social justice, and many of these risks have been crystallised particularly with impacts upon poorer communities and high value threatened ecosystems. At the same time technological advances in biofuels potentially offer significant benefits in terms of energy security, economic benefits for primary producers in developed and developing countries, new <b>industrial</b> <b>ecologies</b> that can convert waste streams into beneficial uses, and the use of biorefining to produce both fuel and high-value by-products including foods and medicines. An effective governance system for biofuels would allow the realisation of the benefits but control the costs and risks. The IUCN Academy of Environmental Law has attempted {{to come to grips with}} these challenges with a series of scholarly events, which have stimulated the thinking for this paper. The emerging biofuel industry challenges our concepts of legal governance for a number of reasons: projections for the industry suggest that biofuels governance will need to be effective in guiding and controlling the actions of an industry that will be of the scale of the petroleum industry, and even more technologically sophisticated. This industry will be led by some of the strongest corporations in the industrial world, but at the same time is likely to draw on the landscapes and resources that are currently serve the essential needs of the poor, or of creatures that have no effective political or economic voice. the industry paradigm itself is highly heterogoneous and rapidly evolving, with radically different models for feedstock production and sourcing, processing, bioprocessing, commercial structures and end-use. It is difficult to know what to govern, and many of the key elements in the future paradigm are closely guarded secrets of major corporations. Governments are at a significant disadvantage in attempting to govern this industry, in terms of economic imbalance, jurisdictional constraints, competing fundamental goals of intervention, and information assymetry. Traditional instruments are likely to be insufficient to ensure effective governance. Whilst there are many standards and other industry-led initiatives in process, there are fundamental reasons why these may also prove to be desirable but insufficient as the basis for governance. This is not least of all because the industry itself will consist of highly variegated <b>industrial</b> <b>ecologies</b> operated by powerful and highly varied industry participants in different countries. This paper considers the totality of the biofuels governance challenges. It suggests that whilst various traditional elements will be necessary, they will be insufficient to the impending governance task. The paper outlines an alternative conceptual model based upon system-focused ‘smart regulation’. Taking into account empirical research conducted around biofuels weeds, the paper will then consider the specific legal and institutional impediments that any such innovation will encounter. Finally, the paper will outline the implications of these issues for natural resource governance using the law, more generally as an illustration of the extent of change that is likely to be needed in legal instruments, institutions and strategy (and the scholarship of these) to cope with the radically different contexts that are emerging which do challenge our assumptions about the capacity of environmental law...|$|R

40|$|From a {{thermodynamic}} {{point of}} view, the attribution of the adjective sustainable {{to an open}} system like the city is, at least, very problematic. The biosphere is a closed system, kept far from the thermodynamic equilibrium by the flow of energy coming from the sun. The biosphere maintains and increases its internal order dispersing entropy, generated by all the internal processes, as thermal infrared radiation. But then, the elegant picture of sustainability given by thermodynamics can not be applied to open systems, and notably to the city, without raising both theoretical and practical problems. The city is almost by definition a place of consumption and of degradation of potentials, kept in local equilibrium by external flows of matter and energy, {{but at the same}} time plays a key role in shaping and maintaining the global flows of matter, energy, and information, and this role must be taken into account when interpreting thermodynamic-based descriptions. The urban capital probably represents the greatest investment made by mankind. Materials have been harvested from the earth crust and from the natural systems, and have been concentrated and ordered in the city. But the "city" is not the infrastructure: it's concept of a different logical type. The city is a further level of organization that produces services of higher level. The urban infrastructure is necessary, but not sufficient to produce the city services. The city is the most important social and health "device". A proper accounting must consider the city-performance of the urban infrastructure, beyond the mere, local energy and carbon efficiency. In this context, local GHG accounting is proposed as a rather simple and useful basis to ground process-wise studies and projects, including the creation of effective local <b>industrial</b> <b>ecologies,</b> in a continuous city-making effort toward higher sustainability...|$|R

30|$|The {{theory of}} {{impulsive}} dynamic equations is generally thought {{to provide a}} natural framework for mathematical modeling of many real world phenomena such as chemotherapy, population dynamics, optimal control, <b>ecology,</b> <b>industrial</b> robotics, physics phenomena, etc. The impulsive effects can be broadly found in numerous evolution processes where their states may undergo abrupt changes at specific moments of time.

In the motion of spacecraft, on the contrary, we are supposed to consider instantaneous impulses depending on the position leading to jump discontinuities in velocity, but with no changes in terms of position. Impulsive problems such as problem (1) are considered as highly important for the description of quite a large number of real world phenomena including biology (biological phenomena involving thresholds), medicine (bursting rhythm models), pharmacokinetics, mechanics, and engineering. To this end, we have established, in this paper, the existence criteria of at least three solutions for the perturbed impulsive problem (1) based on variational methods and the critical point theory, under suitable hypotheses. The results of the study, finally, illustrated that these solutions are generated by impulses while h≡ 0.|$|R

What is missing is a rigorous and systematic approach to addressing dynamics, one that encompasses {{an understanding of}} complex system dynamics and provides a useable guide to action. This paper is a first attempt by the STEPS Centre to address this challenge. To open, the paper reviews a range of different approaches to understanding dynamics, including complexity science, dynamic <b>ecology,</b> <b>industrial</b> socio-technical systems and policy and organisational responses, exploring opportunities, complementarities and gaps. Next, the paper examines how such approaches to understanding dynamic systems can illuminate and extend approaches to sustainable development, concluding that a new science for sustainability requires an integration of now well-elaborated non-equilibrium perspectives from the natural sciences with constructivist social science perspectives. Drawing on these diverse literatures and debates, the final section presents a heuristic framework for addressing dynamic contexts in debates about sustainable development. In conclusion, the paper highlights three things: the need to address diverse framings of both system structure and function, the need to assess trade-offs between system properties that underlie attempts to achieve sustainability {{and the need to}} be continuously reflexive about the diverse options implied.

The reconnaissance testing and data recovery programs at the sites were aimed at assessing the eligibility of the resources {{for inclusion in the}} National Register of Historic Places and to mitigate adverse impact on the cultural resources in the project tracts. The research was performed under contract with the Tennessee Valley Authority. The archaeological and documentary resources examined pertained principally to a tract of land where the Western and Atlantic and Nashville and Chattanooga Railroads and their successors maintained terminal yards from c. 1850 to c. 1978, when the project area was acquired by the Tennessee Valley Authority for urban redevelopment. The areas examined archaeologically were the maintenance and freight yards adjoining the Union Depot, a large jointly owned passenger facility. A tract of land adjoining the railyards and used during the 19 th century as a stockyard was also tested archaeologically. The research design for the investigations proposed generating: (1) a site-specific documentary history of the development of the yards and concommitant archaeological documentation of the railroad-related structures and features in the yards, (2) information concerning the shift from wrought iron to steel rail hardware, and the shift from wood to coal locomotive fuel, (3) information concerning the nature and distribution of industrial waste at the sites, (4) documentation concerning the ecology of the site, particularly the flora-supporting characteristics of artificial soil (coal, cinder, and clinker), and (5) an examination of 2 ̆ 2 real 2 ̆ 2 versus 2 ̆ 2 ideal 2 ̆ 2 construction practices, comparing archaeologically-observed material behavior with ideal engineering construction practice as evidenced by engineering textbooks and related literature.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the development of}} the Australian graduate industrial designer in a period of significant change. It explores the mismatches between current industrial design education approaches, the lived experiences of recent graduates and the changing design employment ecology both globally and locally. It also highlights the instability generated by the lack of consensus on the role, function and parameters of industrial design as a discipline and a profession: instability which both contributes to and is caused by these incongruities. While a time of flux and uncertainty, the current situation is also one of great potential. Traditional modes of practice are disappearing; however, the latent capacity of design is largely untapped. Guiding the realisation of that promise offers exciting prospects for design educators, practitioners and society more broadly. The thesis is based upon primary qualitative research which investigated the career trajectories and practices of a group of industrial design graduates qualifying from the University of Canberra in the period 1996 - 2006. Participants took part in semi-structured interviews developed from predetermined themes drawn from a review of literature and reflections on my own practice as a design educator. The resultant rich narratives of the graduates’ lived experiences provided the opportunity to identify and analyse the application of industrial design and industrial design education to the range of possible employment and professional sectors of practice. A key finding was the resilience and adaptability demonstrated by these graduates as they negotiated multiple forms of design practice. On the basis of this research, a series of models were developed, comprising: • The Adopter-Adapter-Departer model: which described three categories of industrial design graduates • The Thematic Map of Australian Industrial Design Practice: which described the themes of practice which emerged from the interview data • Triple Axes Model: which described the relationship between six competing priorities as continuums set on three axes. • The Design Development Wave: which described the balance between back and front end design processes • Archetypes of Australian Industrial Design Practice: which described a typology of existing and emerging practice • Australian <b>Industrial</b> Design <b>Ecology</b> Framework: which described the location of the past, present and future areas of industrial design practice. Taken together, these models and archetypes constituted the concept of Resilient Adaptive Design Practice. The value of the concept was tested first with the past and present: as it explained and aligned with observed reality. The contributions made by this research have drawn in large part on the qualitative and rich data from in-depth interviews with participants. Their lived experience powerfully demonstrates that the future has arrived: while some may still speculate on the implications of a post-Design For Manufacture industrial design environment, many of our younger industrial designers are living and practising new forms of design in that reality. This research is significant to Australian industrial design practice and education as it acts as a mirror, held up to the profession as a whole enabling the self-reflection required to lay the ground work for change...|$|R
40|$|The article {{describes}} the main provisions of the categories «potential» and «capital», their dialectic interconnection and interdependence {{in the field of}} regional socio-economic studies. The analysis of the concept of «potential» used in the different branches of knowledge, beginning with its essence as a general philosophical category and ending with the use in private, <b>industrial</b> sciences (economics, <b>ecology,</b> environmental management, resources, etc.) is conducted. The results of the analysis show that all the definitions are overly specific, represent the various modifications of the traditional «resource» concept and need in theoretical generalization. The authors have highlighted the most important essential features of the «potential» that characterize it as an attribute, an inherent quality of any object or phenomenon. On this theoretical basis, the definition of «regional capacity» is given and its structure, characterized by functionality, multi aspects and multiplicity is revealed. The potential of a territory is manifested in the following forms: the availability (concentration), gravity (gravitation), capacity (accommodation), stability (security) and positioning (position). Each of these aspects brings together the private (partial) potentials. Special attention is paid to the processes of the transformation of regional capacities, to the identification of the directions and stages of its transformation. Based on the philosophical principles of Aristotle and Immanuel Kant, it is proposed to allocate five strategic ways to actualize the potential of a territory — sustainability, quantity, quality, position, and capitalization. Capitalization of potential involves increasing its stability, size, quality, and availability that turns it from «possible» (prerequisites, conditions, factors) to the «necessity» (necessity, obligation). Work converts potential into a real social value — capital. The regional capital is an universal use-value, forming a successful and competitive regional socio-economics necessary to the society.
