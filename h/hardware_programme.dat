40|$|Abstract. This paper {{deals with}} an {{emerging}} type of computing – evolvable computing. In evolvable computing {{solutions to problems}} dynamically evolve during system’s lifespan either as programs for a universal computer or configurations for a physical reconfigurable device. In this paper the roots of evolvable computing are indicated, a method is presented for routine design of evolvable systems by means of evolvable components and some consequences for theoretical computer science are highlighted. In particular it is shown why evolvable computing cannot be simulated on a standard Turing machine. As examples, two evolvable components – for image pre-processing and for evolution of small pipelined combinational circuits – demonstrate implementations in an ordinary field programmable gate array. Key words: evolvable component, evolvable <b>hardware,</b> genetic <b>programme,</b> reconfigurable devic...|$|R
40|$|A proton beam {{with the}} basic {{structure}} defined by the the LHC requirements, was first available for injection into the SPS in 1998. At the end of 2002, following a significant beam-studies and RF <b>hardware</b> upgrade <b>programme,</b> a beam having both the nominal LHC intensity and the correct longitudinal parameters was obtained at top energy for the first time. This beam, characterised by high local density, must satisfy strict requirements on bunch length, longitudinal emittance and bunch to bunch phase modulation for extraction to the LHC, where only very limited particle losses are acceptable. The problems to be solved came mainly from the high beam loading and microwave and coupled bunch instabilities which led both to beam losses and to unacceptably large longitudinal emittance on the flat top. In this paper the steps taken to arrive at these nominal beam parameters are presented...|$|R
40|$|An {{introduction}} to solar sailing is presented. The physical principles are briefly reviewed {{along with an}} {{introduction to}} the historical context of solar sailing. Potential solar sail configurations are briefly introduced, while placing these {{in the context of the}} current <b>hardware</b> development <b>programmes.</b> Following the introduction to solar sailing we progress onto a discussion of solar sail orbital dynamics in a planet-centred environment. The development of solar sail trajectory generation is presented, from Earth escape trajectories through to lunar fly-by trajectories and more accurate Earth escape methods. Much of this work relies on assumptions to generate near-optimal solutions rather than true globally optimal solutions, which are computationally difficult to determine for multiple revolution trajectories. Many of these traditional planet-centred solar sail applications, such as Earth escape, also require rapid attitude slew manoeuvres to achieve. This first lecture is based on theory development and application with a view towards future missions, such as planetary sample return...|$|R

In the opening part of the work there are briefly mentioned real possibilities of using graphics applications at schools. Separate analyses of all programmes are described in following parts. The analyses deal with features of the <b>programmes,</b> <b>hardware</b> requirements and usability. The comparisons should offer enough general information for choosing the correct software. The important part of the work is the research and it's three questionnaire investigations. Their results demonstrate real usage of graphic software among informants from all of the Czech Republic. KEYWORDS: Computer graphics, graphics editors, analysis, questionnaire investigatio...|$|R
40|$|MoonLITE is a proposed, UK-led lunar science mission {{comprising}} 4 scientific penetrators {{that will}} make in-situ measurements at widely separated locations on the Moon. They will form a global seismic network capable of investigating {{the interior of the}} Moon including the existence of a core, its size and nature such as whether it is liquid or not. Particular landing sites at 1 each pole will also allow determination of the existence of water and other volatiles, and astrobiological organics possibly deposited by impacting comets. The other two landing sites will include the far side which has also not yet seen a landing, and a landing near an Apollo site to allow correlation with previous results. Additionally, detection of lunar water resources and possible sites to avoid large seismic events potentially dangerous to lunar bases offer information very valuable to future human missions. We will present a brief overview of this mission and its current status, including results from the forthcoming full scale impact tests currently on-schedule for late May this year, and from the pre-trial survival modelling. The current status of the planned Phase-A analysis and NASA involvement, and associated parallel <b>hardware</b> development <b>programme</b> will also be presented, together with their potential impact on the future development programme. We will additionally discuss the current status of possible coordination with the recently NASA proposed lunar geophysical network, and with other proposed lunar missions...|$|R
40|$|The {{improvement}} and {{further development of}} a laboratory catchment and rainfall simulator is described. The rainfall simulator enabled the reproduction of rainfall of any intensity between 0 and 120 mm/hr, with properties {{similar to those of}} natural rainfall. The rainfall simulator was subsequently linked to a process control computer, which could control the apparatus to produce either a single or a series of rainstorms. Storms with uniform or varying rainfall intensities could be simulated, with the resulting runoff and percolation being measured and then-recorded by the computer. A description is given of the <b>hardware</b> and computer <b>programmes</b> which were developed to operate the equipment. An experimental programme was conducted on the apparatus to examine the relationships between intensity, runoff and infiltration, and other hydrological properties of a catchment. Particular attention was given to a soil's infiltration capacity, which was found to vary with rainfall intensity. This lid to the derivstion of an infiltration equation in which rainfall intensity is a variable. A study of the rate of recovery of a soil's infiltration capacity enabled an empirical formula to be established which enables a soil's infiltration capacity to be determined at a time after rainfall has ceased...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} Welsh Repository Network (WRN) was to put {{in place}} an {{essential}} building block for the development of an integrated network of institutional digital repositories in Wales. The project entailed a centrally managed <b>hardware</b> procurement <b>programme</b> designed to provide every HEI in Wales with dedicated and configured repository hardware. In close collaboration with the technical, organisational and operational support specifically provided for Welsh Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) within the JISC funded Repositories Support Project (RSP), also delivered from Aberystwyth University, this initiative provided a cost-effective, collaborative and decisive boost to the repository agenda in Wales and helped JISC achieve the critical mass of populated repositories and digital content that is a stated objective of the Repositories and Preservation Programme. The project employed a three-stage approach: requirements gathering, procurement and installation, and monitoring and evaluation. Extensive site visits and regular communication with project partners were a fundamental aspect of project activity and a variety of models were used for procuring hardware including collaborative approaches, outsourcing to commercial software and establishing hosting agreements. At its most practical level the principal deliverable of the WRN project has been the provision of repository hardware capacity in each and every HEI in Wales which, in combination with the hands-on technical support provided by the RSP, enabled all 12 HEIs to have functional institutional repositories by March 2009. More generally, the project has contributed a series of case studies and test sites that provide the wider JISC community with practical insights into the process of matching alternative organisational models, repository types and hardware configurations to different geographical and institutional settings. The main conclusion to be drawn from the WRN is that while providing funds for procuring hardware helps to push repository development up the institutional agenda, the support that goes with the funding, especially the technical support, is a far more crucial factor in generating a successful and lasting outcome...|$|R
