5|$|In ambient {{pressure}} diving, the diver is directly {{exposed to the}} pressure of the surrounding water. The {{ambient pressure}} diver may dive on breath-hold, or use breathing apparatus for scuba diving or surface-supplied diving, and the saturation diving technique reduces the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) after long-duration deep dives. Atmospheric <b>diving</b> <b>suits</b> (ADS) may be used to isolate the diver from high ambient pressure. Crewed submersibles can extend depth range, and remotely controlled or robotic machines can reduce risk to humans.|$|E

25|$|A <b>diving</b> <b>suit</b> is {{a garment}} or device {{designed}} to protect a diver from the underwater environment. A <b>diving</b> <b>suit</b> may also incorporate a breathing gas supply (i.e. Standard diving dress or atmospheric <b>diving</b> <b>suit).</b> {{but in most cases}} applies only to the environmental protective covering worn by the diver. The breathing gas supply is usually referred to separately. There is no generic term for the combination of suit and breathing apparatus alone. It is generally referred to as diving equipment or dive gear along with any other equipment necessary for the dive.|$|R

25|$|Effects {{of weather}} such as wind, which causes waves, and changes of {{temperature}} and atmospheric pressure on {{and in the}} water. Even moderately high winds can prevent diving because of the increased risk of becoming lost at sea or injured. Low water temperatures make it necessary for divers to wear <b>diving</b> <b>suits</b> and can cause problems such as freezing of diving regulators.|$|E
25|$|The first {{diving suit}} designs {{appeared}} in the early 18th century. Two English inventors developed the first pressure-proof <b>diving</b> <b>suits</b> in the 1710s. John Lethbridge built a completely enclosed suit to aid in salvage work. It consisted of a pressure-proof air-filled barrel with a glass viewing hole and two watertight enclosed sleeves. This suit gave the diver more maneouverability to accomplish useful underwater salvage work.|$|E
25|$|Thermal {{conductivity}} {{of water}} is {{higher than that of}} air. As water conducts heat 20 times more than air, divers in cold water must insulate their bodies with <b>diving</b> <b>suits</b> to avoid hypothermia. Gases used in diving have very different thermal conductivity; trimix conducts heat more than air and argon conducts less heat than air hence the reason many trimix divers inflate their drysuits with argon.|$|E

5000|$|In 1860, Rouquayrol became {{concerned}} with mine safety {{problems related to}} firedamp (flammable natural gases in coal mines). He created a rescue apparatus consisting of a pressurized gas chamber coupled to a pressure regulator that he called the [...] "Regulator for Equalization of Compressed Gas." [...] In 1864, {{with the help of}} the French Navy lieutenant Auguste Denayrouze (also of Aveyron), Rouquayrol created the first <b>diving</b> <b>suit.</b> This <b>diving</b> <b>suit</b> won the gold medal at the 1867 World's Fair, and drew the attention of author Jules Verne. Verne included the <b>diving</b> <b>suit</b> in his fictional depiction of a contemporary submarine voyage, 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea.|$|R
25|$|To dive safely, divers must {{control their}} {{rate of descent}} and ascent {{in the water and}} be able to {{maintain}} a constant depth in midwater. Ignoring other forces such as water currents and swimming, the diver's overall buoyancy determines whether they ascend or descend. Equipment such as diving weighting systems, <b>diving</b> <b>suits</b> (wet, dry or semi-dry suits are used depending on the water temperature) and buoyancy compensators can be used to adjust the overall buoyancy. When divers want to remain at constant depth, they try to achieve neutral buoyancy. This minimises the effort of swimming to maintain depth and therefore reduces gas consumption.|$|E
25|$|Most {{commercial}} diving {{dry suits}} have heavy duty integral boots. Sport <b>diving</b> <b>suits</b> may have lightweight integral boots or soft neoprene booties. Rock boots or heavy working boots {{may also be}} worn over integral neoprene or latex socks. Boots which are stiff at the ankle make finning inefficient and are unsuitable for many diving applications where mobility is important. If the suit will be used by a diver who needs to fin efficiently on some dives and to walk on sharp surfaces on other dives, it is more effective to wear boots suited to the dive over a dry suit with integral socks.|$|E

It consisted of a pressure-proof air-filled barrel with a glass viewing hole and two watertight enclosed sleeves. After testing this machine in his garden pond specially built for the purpose, Lethbridge dived {{on a number of}} wrecks: four English men-of-war, one East Indiaman, two Spanish galleons and a number of galleys. He became very wealthy {{as a result of his}} salvages. One of his better-known recoveries was on the Dutch Slot ter Hooge, which had sunk off Madeira with over three tons of silver on board.|$|E

25|$|The {{certified}} scuba diver {{is expected}} to be able to assess what type of diving exposure suit is suitable for the planned dive, and to check that it is in safe usable condition, that it is the right size, and to dress correctly in it. Entry level skills usually cover wet suits, but in countries where the water and/or weather conditions are very cold, dry suit skills may be considered an entry level skill. In other parts of the world, dry suit skills are considered a specialty skill. Where dry suits are used, the skills of using the dry suit safely during a dive are also necessary. These include equalizing, buoyancy control, inversion recovery, emergency venting and blowup recovery. Recreational divers trained in warm tropical waters may have no skills in the use of <b>diving</b> <b>suits.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Koubu mecha designs, {{along with}} the game's CGI sequences, were created by Futoshi Nagata. His initial design outline from Hiroi was the basic concept of steampunk {{technology}} within the Taishō period. When designing the Koubu, Nagata was guided by Morita, who showed him photographs of both steam-powered trains and early deep sea <b>diving</b> <b>suits,</b> specifically those made of spherical segments. When creating the designs, Nagata consciously avoided the trope of anachronistic near-future technology, doing extensive research on the Second Industrial Revolution in the United Kingdom. The concept of a diving suit fitted in with the concept for the Koubo as being reinforced armor rather than robots. Its front was designed after the steam trains that ran on the Aji Express Line. For the armor of the Flower Division, Nagata designed them to mirror each member's traits and beauties, designing them so they would be {{a unique set of}} armor rather. Because the Koubu were meant to be armor rather than robots, they were not given faces. Because Nagata was brought on early in the game's production, he had considerable freedom when submitting and adjusting his designs. When the designs were finalized, Nagata began working full-time on CGI, finishing the first Koubu design in five days.|$|E
25|$|Only a few {{types of}} sharks are {{dangerous}} to humans. Out {{of more than}} 480 shark species, only three are responsible for two-digit numbers of fatal unprovoked attacks on humans: the great white, tiger and bull; however, the oceanic whitetip has probably killed many more castaways which have not been recorded in the statistics. These sharks, being large, powerful predators, may sometimes attack and kill people; however, they have all been filmed in open water by unprotected divers. The 2010 French film Oceans shows footage of humans swimming next to sharks in the ocean. It {{is possible that the}} sharks are able to sense the presence of unnatural elements on or about the divers, such as polyurethane <b>diving</b> <b>suits</b> and air tanks, which may lead them to accept temporary outsiders as more of a curiosity than prey. Uncostumed humans, however, such as those surfboarding, light snorkeling or swimming, present a much greater area of exposed skin surface to sharks. In addition, the presence of even small traces of blood, recent minor abrasions, cuts, scrapes or bruises, may lead sharks to attack a human in their environment. Sharks seek out prey through electroreception, sensing the electric fields that are generated by all animals due to the activity of their nerves and muscles.|$|E
