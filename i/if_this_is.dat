5|$|If any motion exists {{without a}} cause, then not every {{proposition}} will be either true or false. For {{that which has}} not efficient causes is neither true nor false. But every proposition is either true or false. Therefore, there is no motion without a cause. And <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> so, then all effects owe their existence to prior causes. And <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> so, all things happen by fate. It follows therefore that whatever happens, happens by fate.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} other factors are less closely linked to COPD. The risk is greater in those who are poor, {{although}} it is not clear <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> due to poverty itself or other risk factors associated with poverty, such as air pollution and malnutrition. There is tentative evidence that those with asthma and airway hyperreactivity are at increased risk of COPD. Birth factors such as low birth weight may also play a role as do a number of infectious diseases including HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Respiratory infections such as pneumonia do not appear to increase the risk of COPD, at least in adults.|$|E
5|$|Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Law at Queen Mary, University of London, {{suggests}} {{the potential for}} a third class of secret trust.

5|$|Alternatively, recent {{excavations}} {{have yielded}} seals of Neferhotep's brother Sobekhotep IV in proximity with seals {{of the powerful}} Hyksos king Khyan of the 15th Dynasty (c.16501550 BC) in a closed archaeological context, possibly indicating that the two were contemporary. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> so, Neferhotep I would have been contemporary with either Khyan {{or one of his}} predecessors, such as Sakir-Har, and would not have reigned over the Nile Delta. This conclusion is strongly debated at the moment since Sobekhotep IV and Khyan are separated by c. 100 years in the conventional Egyptian chronology.|$|E

Seibal Stela 10, dating to roughly 849 AD, has an inscription naming Kan Ek' as ruler of Motul de San José, which is recorded as being one of the four paramount polities in the mid-9th century (ca. 849), along with Calakmul, Tikal and Seibal itself.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Spanish Conquest, the main Mam {{population}} was situated in Xinabahul (also spelled Chinabjul), now the city of Huehuetenango. They retreated to Zaculeu as a refuge during the Spanish attacks because of its fortifications. The refuge was attacked by Gonzalo de Alvarado y Contreras, brother of conquistador Pedro de Alvarado, in 1525, with 120 soldiers, and some 2,000 Mexican and K'iche' allies. The city was defended by Kayb'il B'alam commanding some 5,000 people (the chronicles are not clear <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the number of soldiers or the total population of Zaculeu).|$|E
5|$|Because {{high levels}} of jitter have been {{detected}} in the spectrum of HAT-P-33, the ability to collect the most sensitive radial velocity measurements possible has been dulled. The loss of accuracy has prevented astronomers from disregarding the possibility that HAT-P-33 is actually a binary star, where the secondary, dimmer companion is visually indistinguishable from the brighter primary companion. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the case, then the dimmer star in the HAT-P-33 system {{would have to have}} a mass that is less than 0.55 times that of the Sun. A search for a binary companion star using adaptive optics at the MMT Observatory was negative.|$|E
