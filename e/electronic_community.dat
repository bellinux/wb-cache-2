40|$|Abstract. <b>Electronic</b> <b>communities</b> can be {{designed}} to organize consumers, to pool their purchasing power, and to guide their purchasing decisions. Such commercial <b>electronic</b> <b>communities</b> {{have the potential to}} facil-itate the creation of novel marketplaces, and even radically change the buyer–seller interaction, as physical communities did throughout the history. Commercial <b>electronic</b> <b>communities</b> are groups of consumers that participate in the marketplace as a single unit. In addition to bargaining power gained from such bundling, such communities can expand markets by reducing market uncertainty, and they have the potential to dras-tically reduce transaction costs. However, these benefits are not automatic, and the optimum design and implementation of communities are critical to their economic success. The size and the makeup of a com-munity, the size {{and the nature of the}} product bundle it offers, and the concise description and efficient implementation of the <b>community</b> as an <b>electronic</b> marketplace are all critical factors for the success of a community...|$|R

40|$|The {{members of}} <b>electronic</b> <b>communities</b> are often {{unrelated}} to each other, {{they may have}} never met and have no information on each other's reputation. This kind of information is vital in Electronic Commerce interactions, where the potential counterpart's reputation can be {{a significant factor in}} the negotiation strategy. This paper proposes two complementary reputation mechanisms that rely on collaborative rating and personalized evaluation of the various ratings assigned to each user. While these reputation mechanisms are developed in the context of electronic commerce, we believe that they may have applicability in other types of <b>electronic</b> <b>communities</b> such as chatrooms, newsgroups, mailing lists etc. 1.

In 2012, CyberVillage was rebuilt from the ground up as a series of social networking blogs built on the Wordpress blogging platform. The two groups of sites, CyberVillage.com and CyberVillage.biz, include news and shopping sites. Rob said the sites do not currently generate revenue, but they currently have 144,000 pages in Google's database, and it continues to grow slowly.|$|E

40|$|Critical to {{understanding}} how an <b>electronic</b> learning <b>community</b> {{can be established}} and sustained is understanding how learners and educators interact within the community. The study reported in this paper found {{that the development of}} an <b>electronic</b> learning <b>community</b> is a complex process that relies on the willingness of the learners to adopt a collaborative learning style. This appears to require a major shift in their learning behaviour and is a process in which the educators appear to have little influence. A discussion forum designed to provide a collaborative learning environment where students can discuss learning issues and provide feedback to staff has provided a vehicle for this study. An investigation of student and staff use of the discussion forum has informed the development of a set of visual representations that may be used to describe <b>electronic</b> learning <b>communities...</b>|$|R
