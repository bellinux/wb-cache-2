5|$|Kiedis had {{remained}} sober the entire tour and maintained positive disposition during shows. Navarro, however, was growing tired of touring, {{and that was}} beginning to grate on his fellow band-mates. Kiedis suffered an additional injury in Prague after falling off the stage while attempting to execute a back flip. He was forced to wear a back brace {{for the next few}} shows, which restricted his actions to the area around his microphone. After shows in Paris and London, the band returned home to Los Angeles. Kiedis began taking drugs once again, though he <b>forced</b> <b>himself</b> to discontinue after several weeks. The band was then asked to play in the North Pole for roughly 100 contest winners of a concert set up by Molson, a Canadian beer company. While the show was mildly motivating to the band, they returned home after two days.|$|E
5|$|In late 1558, Calvin {{became ill}} with a fever. Since {{he was afraid}} that he might die before {{completing}} the final revision of the Institutes, he <b>forced</b> <b>himself</b> to work. The final edition was greatly expanded to the extent that Calvin referred to it as a new work. The expansion from the 21 chapters of the previous edition to 80 was due to the extended treatment of existing material rather than the addition of new topics. Shortly after he recovered, he strained his voice while preaching, which brought on a violent fit of coughing. He burst a blood-vessel in his lungs, and his health steadily declined. He preached his final sermon in St. Pierre on 6February 1564. On 25April, he made his will, in which he left small sums to his family and to the collège. A few days later, the ministers of the church came to visit him, and he bade his final farewell, which was recorded in Discours d'adieu aux ministres. He recounted his life in Geneva, sometimes recalling bitterly some of the hardships he had suffered. Calvin died on 27May 1564 aged 54. At first his body lay in state, but since so many people came to see it, the reformers were afraid that they would be accused of fostering a new saint's cult. On the following day, he was buried in an unmarked grave in the Cimetière des Rois. The exact location of the grave is unknown; a stone was added in the 19th century to mark a grave traditionally thought to be Calvin's.|$|E
25|$|Ellis had exaggerated {{fears of}} {{speaking}} {{in public and}} during his adolescence, he was extremely shy around women. At age 19, already showing signs of thinking like a cognitive-behavioral therapist, he <b>forced</b> <b>himself</b> to talk to 100 women in the Bronx Botanical Gardens {{over a period of}} a month. Even though he did not get a date, he reported that he desensitized himself to his fear of rejection by women.|$|E

He also scored his maiden first-class fifty in this season, the first of 22 he was to make in his career. Although he never managed to convert one of these into a century, his top score being 98 against the New Zealanders at Worcester in 1990.|$|E
25|$|On 31 October, the {{prosecution}} called Dr. Paul Bowden {{to testify in}} rebuttal of the psychiatrists who had testified for the defence counsel. Prior to Nilsen's trial, Dr. Bowden had interviewed the defendant on 16 separate occasions in interviews totalling over 14 hours. Over two days, Dr. Bowden testified that, although he found Nilsen to be abnormal in a colloquial sense, he had concluded Nilsen to be a manipulative individual who had been capable of forming relationships, but had <b>forced</b> <b>himself</b> to objectify people. Refuting the testimony of Dr. MacKeith and Dr. Gallwey, Bowden further testified he had {{found no evidence of}} maladaptive behaviour, and that Nilsen suffered from no disorder of the mind.|$|E
25|$|Mannock had {{initially}} to overcome {{his fear of}} combat. On 13 April he crossed into no mans land {{for the first time}} during the opening days of the Arras offensive and was subjected to German anti-aircraft artillery for the first time. He mishandled his aircraft and dropped out of formation. Subsequent patrols did not abate his fear. A man who performed in such a manner was suspect and he was shunned in the mess. On 19 April 1917, and in view of the entire squadron, Mannock finally won some respect when he landed his aircraft during a firing practice after the lower right wing tore away. Mannock <b>forced</b> <b>himself</b> into the air again and continued to practice. Eventually he adopted the tactic of closing to within 20 or 30 yards to open fire.|$|E

25|$|Poor old Keeper, Emily's {{faithful}} {{friend and}} worshipper, {{seemed to understand}} her like a human being. One evening, when the four friends were sitting closely round {{the fire in the}} sitting-room, Keeper <b>forced</b> <b>himself</b> in between Charlotte and Emily and mounted himself on Emily’s lap; finding the space too limited for his comfort he pressed himself forward on to the guest’s knees, making himself quite comfortable. Emily’s heart was won by the unresisting endurance of the visitor, little guessing that she herself, being in close contact, was the inspiring cause of submission to Keeper’s preference. Sometimes Emily would delight in showing off Keeper—make him frantic in action, and roar with the voice of a lion. It was a terrifying exhibition within the walls of an ordinary sitting-room. Keeper was a solemn mourner at Emily’s funeral and never recovered his cheerfulness.|$|E
25|$|Milburn had a {{reputation}} as an all-or-nothing batsman, sparkling centuries alternating with indifferent scores, but by 1966 he had <b>forced</b> <b>himself</b> back into the Test reckoning. Selected for the First Test against the West Indies, he had the most ignominious start for an opener, run out for a first-innings duck. He redeemed himself with 94 in the second innings as England went down to a heavy defeat. An aggressive century (126 not out) helped England to draw the Second Test, and despite standing up courageously to the formidable Caribbean pace attack in the following matches, he was dropped for the final Test, supposedly because his bulk hindered his mobility in the field. Milburn's riposte was typical of the man, an innings of 203 for Northamptonshire against Essex. His swashbuckling season earned him a nomination as one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year in the 1967 edition.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} develop {{material}} for Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Smith <b>forced</b> <b>himself</b> to write music for 15 days of each month. During this regimen, he developed the chords and melody which {{form the basis of}} [...] "Just Like Heaven". Structurally, Smith found what he had written was similar to the Only Ones's 1979 hit [...] "Another Girl, Another Planet". When he brought an instrumental demo of the song to the album recording sessions in Southern France, Cure drummer Boris Williams increased the tempo and added an opening drum fill which inspired Smith to introduce each instrument singularly and in sequence.|$|E

She is initially reluctant to introduce {{him to her}} flatmates and when she does, they are {{surprised to see that}} he is a lot older. John asks Toyah to move in with him and she agrees. When Toyah and Fiz argue about John, Fiz tells her that he and Maria had sex and Maria got pregnant. Toyah confronts Maria, who gives her the impression that John <b>forced</b> <b>himself</b> on her.

500|$|Tchaikovsky {{allowed the}} first version to be premiered by Nikolai Rubinstein on March 16, 1870, after the {{composer}} had incorporated only some of Balakirev's suggestions. The premiere was a disaster. Stung by this rejection, Tchaikovsky took Balakirev's strictures to heart. He <b>forced</b> <b>himself</b> to reach beyond his musical training and rewrote much of the music into the form we know it today. Romeo would bring Tchaikovsky his first national and international acclaim and become a work the kuchka lauded unconditionally. On hearing the love theme from Romeo, Stasov told the group, [...] "There were five of you; now there are six". Such was the enthusiasm of the Five for Romeo that at their gatherings Balakirev was always asked to play it through at the piano. He did this {{so many times that}} he learned to perform it from memory.|$|E
500|$|Later in 1939, Prokofiev {{composed}} his Piano Sonatas Nos. 6, 7, and 8, Opp. 82–84, {{widely known}} today as the [...] "War Sonatas." [...] Premiered respectively by Prokofiev (No. 6: 8 April 1940), Sviatoslav Richter (No. 7: Moscow, 18 January 1943) and Emil Gilels (No. 8: Moscow, 30 December 1944), they were subsequently championed in particular by Richter. Biographer Daniel Jaffé argued that Prokofiev, [...] "having <b>forced</b> <b>himself</b> to compose a cheerful evocation of the nirvana Stalin wanted everyone to believe he had created" [...] (i.e. in Zdravitsa) then subsequently, in the three sonatas, [...] "expressed his true feelings". As evidence, Jaffé {{has pointed out that}} the central movement of Sonata No. 7 opens with a theme based on a Robert Schumann lied 'Wehmut' ('Sadness', which appears in Schumann's Liederkreis, Op. 39): its words translate, [...] "I can sometimes sing as if I were glad, yet secretly tears well and so free my heart. Nightingales... sing their song of longing from their dungeon's depth... everyone delights, yet no one feels the pain, the deep sorrow in the song." [...] Ironically (it appears no one noticed his allusion), Sonata No. 7 received a Stalin Prize (Second Class), and No. 8 a Stalin Prize (First Class).|$|E

500|$|After this loss, McGovern {{remained}} in the Senate. He was scarred by the enormous defeat, and his wife Eleanor took it even worse; {{during the winter of}} 1972–73, the couple seriously considered moving to England. His allies were replaced in positions of power within the Democratic Party leadership, and the McGoverns did not get publicly introduced at party affairs they attended. On January 20, 1973, a few hours after Richard Nixon was re-inaugurated, McGovern gave a speech at the Oxford Union that talked about the abuses of Nixon's presidency; it brought criticism, including from some Democrats, for being ill-mannered. In order to get past the [...] "bitterness and self-pity" [...] he felt, McGovern <b>forced</b> <b>himself</b> to deal with the defeat humorously before audiences; starting at the March 1973 Gridiron Dinner, he frequently related his campaign misadventures in a self-deprecating fashion, such as saying, [...] "For many years, I wanted to run for the Presidency in the worst possible way – and last year I sure did." [...] Nevertheless, emotions surrounding the loss would remain with McGovern for decades, as it did with some other defeated presidential nominees. Nixon resigned in August 1974 due to the Watergate scandal. McGovern said President Gerald R. Ford's subsequent September 1974 pardon of Nixon was difficult to understand given that Nixon's subordinates were going to prison.|$|E
500|$|Herbert Tremenheere Hewett {{was born}} at Norton Court in Norton Fitzwarren, near Taunton on 25 May 1864, the only son of William Henry and Frances M Hewett. Although he was the couple's only son, they had at least four daughters; in 1871 two older sisters, Emily Louisa and Helen G {{are listed in the}} census, along with one younger sister, Florance Ethel. By 1891, Mary W is also listed as a younger sister, {{although}} by this date both older sisters are no longer registered at the address nor their father William Henry. He was initially educated at Hillside, Godalming where he was captain of the cricket and rugby teams. On leaving Hillside in 1879 he went to Harrow School. In 1881 he had a trial for the school cricket eleven mainly on the strength of his bowling, having taken all ten wickets for 22 runs in a house match. Hewett was part of the school's cricket first eleven in 1882 and 1883, and appeared in the annual contest against Eton College in both years, but did little on either occasion, his highest score being six, made in the first-innings in 1882. In all matches for Harrow he had a batting average of just 7.4 in 1883 and 9.5 in 1884 while his bowling average in 1884 was 32.10. Hewett also appeared in the school association football eleven in 1883. On completion of his studies at Harrow, he attended Trinity College, Oxford. In his reminiscences, W. G. Grace suggests that Hewett [...] "first won some little renown in Public School and 'Varsity cricket, {{but it was not until}} he joined Somersetshire that he <b>forced</b> <b>himself</b> to a prominent place in County Cricket." ...|$|E
500|$|Matsui {{had gotten}} his way, {{but he still}} {{understood}} that his troops were tired from the fighting in Shanghai. He therefore decided to advance slowly {{with the aim of}} securing the city within two months. Nevertheless, his subordinates refused to play along and instead raced with one another {{to be the first to}} Nanking. Matsui revised his plans only upon discovering that his own armies were well ahead of their scheduled operational targets. It is again argued that Matsui was unable to restrain the men under his command, and that, since Matsui was an elderly general pulled from retirement, most of his younger and brasher subordinates had little respect for his orders and assumed that he would be back in the reserves and shortly out of their way. Matsui's command problems were made further complicated by the fact that, between December 5 and December 15, he was frequently bedridden due to bouts of malaria, which he had first shown symptoms of on November 4. Though ill, he <b>forced</b> <b>himself</b> to press on with his duties, issuing orders from his sickbed. On December 7 he moved his command post from Shanghai to Suzhou in order to be closer to the frontlines, and on December 9 he ordered that a [...] "summons to surrender" [...] be dropped by airplane over Nanking. Because the Chinese Army defending Nanking did not respond, the next day Matsui approved an all-out attack on the city. The CCAA suffered significant casualties fighting along the mountainous terrain just north of the city because Matsui had forbidden his men from using artillery there to prevent any damage from coming to its two famous historical sites, Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum. Although the Chinese garrison defending Nanking collapsed under pressure of the Japanese attack within a few days, instead of formally surrendering the Chinese soldiers simply threw away their uniforms and weapons and then merged with the city's civilian population. The Japanese occupied Nanking on the night of December 12/13. Japanese soldiers in the city then massacred prisoners of war and engaged in random acts of murder, looting, and rape which are collectively known as the Nanking Massacre.|$|E
