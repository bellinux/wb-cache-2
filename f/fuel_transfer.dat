5|$|To {{reduce the}} {{likelihood}} of damage to the A-10's fuel system, all four fuel tanks are located near the aircraft's center and are separated from the fuselage; projectiles would need to penetrate the aircraft's skin before reaching a tank's outer skin. Compromised <b>fuel</b> <b>transfer</b> lines self-seal; if damage exceeds a tank's self-sealing capabilities, check valves prevent fuel flowing into a compromised tank. Most fuel system components are inside the tanks so that fuel will not be lost due to component failure. The refueling system is also purged after use. Reticulated polyurethane foam lines both the inner and outer sides of the fuel tanks, retaining debris and restricting fuel spillage in the event of damage. The engines are shielded {{from the rest of the}} airframe by firewalls and fire extinguishing equipment. In the event of all four main tanks being lost, two self-sealing sump tanks contain fuel for 230miles (370km) of flight.|$|E
25|$|Eleven C-130 Hercules {{transports}} were modified into HC-130P probe-and-drogue refuelers for CH-3 helicopters in 1966–67, {{with training}} beginning at Eglin in 1966. The first <b>fuel</b> <b>transfer</b> was conducted between an HC-130P and an HH-3E on 14 December 1966.|$|E

25|$|On April 1, 2003, VF-154 {{lost one}} of its {{aircraft}} over southern Iraq when it suffered a single engine and <b>fuel</b> <b>transfer</b> system failure which caused the remaining engine to run dry. The crew, already two hours into its mission and having dropped some bombs, ejected and was soon picked up by an HH-60G helicopter. This F-14A was the first coalition aircraft to crash as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom.|$|E
25|$|While Alaska has {{no state}} sales tax, 89 {{municipalities}} collect a local sales tax, from 1.0–7.5%, typically 3–5%. Other local taxes levied include raw fish taxes, hotel, motel, and bed-and-breakfast 'bed' taxes, severance taxes, liquor and tobacco taxes, gaming (pull tabs) taxes, tire taxes and <b>fuel</b> <b>transfer</b> taxes. A {{part of the}} revenue collected from certain state taxes and license fees (such as petroleum, aviation motor fuel, telephone cooperative) is shared with municipalities in Alaska.|$|E
25|$|Alrosa Mirny Air Enterprise Flight 514 was a {{domestic}} scheduled passenger flight from Udachny, Russia, to Moscow. On 7 September 2010, the Tupolev Tu-154M RA-85684 aircraft suffered a complete electrical failure en route, {{leading to a}} loss of navigational systems. The electrically operated <b>fuel</b> <b>transfer</b> pumps were also affected, meaning that the aircraft was unable to reach its intended destination. An emergency landing was carried out at the closed Izhma Airport. The aircraft overran the disused runway on landing and was damaged. All nine crew and 72 passengers escaped unharmed. The crew of Flight 514 were decorated for their actions in the accident.|$|E
50|$|A {{low energy}} transfer, or low energy trajectory, is a route in space which allows {{spacecraft}} to change orbits using very little fuel. These routes {{work in the}} Earth-Moon system and also in other systems, such as traveling between the satellites of Jupiter. The drawback of such trajectories is that they take much longer to complete than higher energy (more <b>fuel)</b> <b>transfers</b> such as Hohmann transfer orbits.|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} {{need for}} a dry transfer system (DTS) to enable retrieval of used nuclear fuel (UNF) for inspection or repackaging will increase as the duration and quantity of fuel in dry storage increases. This report explores the uses for a DTS, identifies associated general functional requirements, and reviews existing and proposed systems that currently perform dry <b>fuel</b> <b>transfers.</b> The focus {{of this paper is}} on the {{need for a}} DTS to enable <b>transfer</b> of bare <b>fuel</b> assemblies. Dry <b>transfer</b> systems for UNF canisters are currently available and in use for transferring loaded canisters between the drying station and storage and transportation casks...|$|R

25|$|Nauka {{mission has}} changed over time. During the mid-1990s, it was {{intended}} as a backup for the FGB, and later as a universal docking module (UDM); its docking ports will be able to support automatic docking of both spacecraft, additional modules and <b>fuel</b> <b>transfer.</b> Nauka has its own engines. Like Zvezda and Zarya, Nauka will be launched by a Proton rocket, while smaller Russian modules such as Pirs and Poisk were delivered by modified Progress spacecraft. Russia plans to separate Nauka, {{along with the rest of}} the Russian Orbital Segment, to form the OPSEK space station before the ISS is deorbited.|$|E
25|$|On 8 February 2005, {{on board}} an Airbus A340-600 {{aircraft}} (G-VATL) {{en route from}} Hong Kong to Heathrow, the fuel control computer system caused a loss of automatic <b>fuel</b> <b>transfer</b> between tanks. The left outboard engine lost power, and shortly afterwards the right outboard engine also began to falter until the crew began to crossfeed fuel manually. The crew diverted to Amsterdam and landed safely. The interim accident report made four safety recommendations addressed to the primary certification bodies for large transport category aircraft (EASA and the FAA), advising {{on the need for}} a low-fuel warning system for large aircraft.|$|E
25|$|In early 2012, due to {{internal}} economic disagreement between the Palestinian Authority and the Hamas Government in Gaza, decreased supplies from Egypt and through tunnel smuggling, and Hamas's refusal to ship fuel via Israel, the Gaza Strip {{plunged into a}} fuel crisis, bringing increasingly long electricity shut downs and disruption of transportation. Egypt had attempted {{for a while to}} stop the use of underground tunnels for delivery of Egyptian fuel purchased by Palestinian authorities, and had severely reduced supply through the tunnel network. As the crisis broke out, Hamas sought to equip the Rafah terminal between Egypt and Gaza for <b>fuel</b> <b>transfer,</b> and refused to accept fuel to be delivered via the Kerem Shalom crossing between Israel and Gaza.|$|E

25|$|On 9 August 1945, Major Sweeney {{commanded}} Bockscar, which {{carried the}} atomic bomb Fat Man from the island of Tinian to Nagasaki. In addition to Bockscar, the mission included two observation and instrumentation support B-29s, The Great Artiste and The Big Stink, who would rendezvous with Bockscar over Yakushima Island. At the mission pre-briefing, the three planes were ordered to make their rendezvous over Yakushima at 30,000 feet due to weather conditions over Iwo Jima (the Hiroshima mission rendezvous). That same morning, {{on the day of}} the mission, the ground crew notified Sweeney that a faulty <b>fuel</b> <b>transfer</b> pump made it impossible to utilize some 625 gallons of fuel in the tail, but Sweeney, as aircraft commander, elected to proceed with the mission.|$|E
25|$|Fourteen British {{servicemen}} {{were killed}} when their Nimrod surveillance aircraft crashed following an on-board fire. The fire was caused when a <b>fuel</b> <b>transfer</b> pipe inside the aircraft ruptured during in-flight refuelling. The aircraft was serialed XV230 and was crewed by RAF Flight personnel drawn from No 120 Squadron at RAF Kinloss. The dead were named as Flt Lt Steven Johnson, Flt Lt Leigh Anthony Mitchelmore, Flt Lt Gareth Nicholas, Flt Lt Allan Squires, Flt Lt Steven Swarbrick, Flt Sgt Gary Andrews, Flt Sgt Stephen Beattie, Flt Sgt Gerard Bell, Flt Sgt Adrian Davis, Sergeant Benjamin James Knight, Sergeant John Joseph Langton and Sergeant Gary Paul Quilliam. Also operational on board the aircraft were personnel from the British Army and the Royal Navy; they were Corporal Oliver Simon Dicketts of the Parachute Regiment and Marine Joseph David Windall of the Royal Marines, who were both serving with the Special Reconnaissance Regiment.|$|E
500|$|During {{pre-flight}} inspection of Bockscar, the flight engineer notified Sweeney that an inoperative <b>fuel</b> <b>transfer</b> pump {{made it impossible}} to use [...] of fuel carried in a reserve tank. This fuel would still have to be carried all the way to Japan and back, consuming still more fuel. Replacing the pump would take hours; moving the Fat Man to another aircraft might take just as long and was dangerous as well, as the bomb was live. Tibbets and Sweeney therefore elected to have Bockscar continue the mission.|$|E

50|$|In {{an effort}} to support the {{international}} response to the unrest in Libya and enforcement of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 of a no-fly zone over Libya, the 313th Air Expeditionary Wing, with the 171st as the lead unit, was stood up in March 2011 by a blend of active duty, guard and reserve airmen. A total of 1500 sorties, 11000 flying hours, and 70 million pounds of <b>fuel</b> <b>transferred</b> aircraft from more than ten countries was accomplished by this citizen-airmen volunteer milita force. Initially, the operation for the no-fly zone was called Operation Odyssey Dawn. As it transitioned to a full-fledged, NATO-led effort, it became Operation Unified Protector. OUP officially ended Oct. 31, 2011.|$|R
500|$|The {{weather that}} forced {{the mission to}} be {{advanced}} by two days also dictated a change in rendezvous to Yakushima, {{much closer to the}} target, and an initial cruise altitude of [...] instead of , both of which considerably increased fuel consumption.

500|$|Because of {{the delays}} in the mission and the {{inoperative}} <b>fuel</b> <b>transfer</b> pump, the B-29 did not have sufficient fuel to reach the emergency landing field at Iwo Jima, so Sweeney flew the aircraft to Okinawa. Arriving there, he circled for 20 minutes trying to contact the control tower for landing clearance, finally concluding that his radio was faulty. Critically low on fuel, Bockscar barely {{made it to the}} runway at Yontan Airfield on Okinawa. With only enough fuel for one landing attempt, Sweeney and Albury brought Bockscar in at [...] instead of the normal , firing distress flares to alert the field of the uncleared landing. The number two engine died from fuel starvation as Bockscar began its final approach. Touching the runway hard, the heavy B-29 slewed left and towards a row of parked B-24 bombers before the pilots managed to regain control. The B-29's reversible propellers were insufficient to slow the aircraft adequately, and with both pilots standing on the brakes, Bockscar made a swerving 90-degree turn {{at the end of the}} runway to avoid running off the runway. A second engine died from fuel exhaustion by the time the plane came to a stop. The flight engineer later measured fuel in the tanks and concluded that less than five minutes total remained.|$|E
50|$|On {{a typical}} RB-47H {{reconnaissance}} mission covering 5,984 mi (9,360 km), the aircraft would fly from Thule, Greenland to the Kara Sea to Murmansk {{and then return}} only to find Thule weathered-in, forcing the flight from the air-refueling/decision point near the northeast shore of Greenland {{to one of three}} equidistant alternates: Goose Bay, Labrador, London, or Fairbanks, Alaska. Five KC-97s at Thule were required to support this scenario. Two ground spares and one air spare insured two 20,000 lb (9,090 kg) <b>fuel</b> <b>transfers</b> at a distance of over 600 mi (965 km) from Thule. Tankers returned to Thule to refuel and again repeat the flight to intercept the returning RB-47H six hours later for another air refueling.|$|R

[...] The weather planes reported both targets within the required visual attack parameters while Bockscar circled Yakushima waiting for the photo plane. Finally the mission proceeded without the photo plane, thirty minutes behind schedule. When Bockscar arrived at Kokura 30 minutes later, cloud cover had increased to 70% of the area, and three bomb runs over the next 50 minutes were fruitless in bombing visually. The commanders decided to reduce power to conserve fuel and divert to Nagasaki, bombing by radar if necessary. [...] The bomb run began at 11:58.
