50|$|The {{yellow-crowned bishop}} was first {{described}} by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789. It and the fire-fronted bishop have occasionally been placed in the separate genus Taha but DNA places it in Euplectes, without close relatives however. In captivity it has interbred with the northern red bishop. Alternate common names include: <b>Golden</b> <b>bishop,</b> Napoleon bishop, Napoleon weaver, black-winged <b>golden</b> <b>bishop,</b> goudgeelvink (in Afrikaans), Napoleonwever (in Dutch), euplecte vorabé (in French), Napoleonweber (in German), and obispo coronigualdo (in Spanish).|$|E
5000|$|The Crest of Gamshurst {{consists}} of a split shield with three <b>golden</b> <b>bishop</b> balls {{that can be seen}} on a blue background on the left side. [...] The right side shows a black Dreienberg plant on a silver background. [...] The three golden balls are attributes of the Holy St. Nicholas, which are for money and gifts that the popular Nothelfer gave to the poor. [...] The coat of arms comes from a recommendation of the General State Archives in January 1913 to adopt a crest that symbolizes the specific history, place, and name of Gamshurst.|$|E

50|$|The {{village is}} {{mentioned}} in a <b>Golden</b> Bulle of <b>bishop</b> Symeon Paleologos of Serbia from 1362. There are two monasteries, the monastery of Evangelistria and the monastery of Agia Paraskevi. The {{first is the}} oldest, restored in 1786, while the second was founded in 1750.|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 117 bird species has been {{recorded}} in Sehlabathebe National Park, south-east Lesotho, consisting of 29 vagrants, 18 visitors and 70 breeding and probable breeding residents. For each species status was determined and abundance roughly estimated. Quantitative studies on breeding bird communities were carried out {{by means of the}} line transect method on four transects with the total length ca 30 km in the park and on two transects with the total length of ca 20 km outside the park. In the park, dominant species were represented by the Stonechat Saxicola torquata, Ayres ’ Cisticola Cisticola ayresii, Yellow-rumped Widow Euplectes capensis and Wailing Cisticola Cisticola lais. Outside the park dominants were represented by Cape Weaver Ploceus capensis, Cape Sparrow Passer melanurus, Cape Canary Serinus canicollis, Common Quail Coturnix coturnix, Stonechat, Cape Bunting Emberiza capensis and Drakensberg Siskin Pseudochloroptila symonsi. Characteristic, high-altitude species in the park included Drakensberg Siskin, Mountain Pipit Anthus hoeschi, Orange-breasted Rockjumper Chaetops auriantius, Banded Martin Riparia cincta and Sentinel Rock Thrush Monticola explorator. Species such as the Laughing Dove Streptopelia senegalensis, Sicklewinged Chat Cercomela sinuata, Mountain Chat Oenanthe monticola, Thick-billed Lark Galerida magnirostris, Red-winged Starling Onychognathus morio, Alpine Swift Apus melba Cape Sparrow, Grey-headed Sparrow Passer diffusus, Red Bishop Euplectes orix and <b>Golden</b> <b>Bishop</b> Euplectes afer were absent or occurred in very low densities in the park, although they are widespread and common in the Maluti/Drakensberg grasslands (including areas neighbouring to the park). The lack of trees and shrubs for nesting, the lack of cultivated fields as feeding places and competition with related species both for food and nesting sites, may partly play a role in this regard...|$|E
50|$|Schereschewsky {{arrived in}} Shanghai on 21 December 1859 {{on the ship}} <b>Golden</b> Rule with <b>Bishop</b> Boone. On 28 October 1860 Bishop Boone ordained him to the priesthood in the mission school chapel, later known as the Church of our Savior, Hongkew.

50|$|In 1935 Dreyer was {{commissioned}} {{to create a}} medal for the <b>Golden</b> Jubilee of <b>Bishop</b> Thomas F. Lillis of Kansas City. In 1936 Dreyer was awarded a commission for five bronze medallions {{that are in the}} lobby of the Jackson County Courthouse. These bronze and white metal medallions represent Faith, Authority, Justice, Aspiration and Progress.|$|R
5000|$|The school's emblem {{consists}} of a blue shield with white trim, surmounted by two <b>golden</b> keys and <b>bishop's</b> mitre (contemporary versions place the mitre within rather than above the shield, dissimilating the emblem {{from that of the}} Diocese of Gloucester). The keys represent Saint Peter while the mitre represents the school's link to the Anglican Church. Beneath the shield is a scroll with the school's Latin motto [...] "Pro Deo et Patria", which translates into English as [...] "For God and Country".|$|R
50|$|Two {{famous people}} are {{associated}} with the abbey: Queen Joan, the wife of Alexander II of Scotland and daughter of King John of England (Richard I's brother and successor), is buried in the graveyard (supposedly in a <b>golden</b> coffin), and <b>Bishop</b> Richard Poore, builder of Salisbury Cathedral, who was baptised in the abbey church and later (in 1237) buried in the abbey, which he founded. He was at one time Dean of the old cathedral at Old Sarum, and later became bishop of first Chichester, then Salisbury and finally Durham.|$|R
50|$|The 75th {{birthday}} celebrations and the sacerdotal <b>golden</b> jubilee of <b>Bishop</b> Stanley Roman {{was held}} on June 4, 2016. Following a request from the bishop, the celebration was made a low key affair. The high mass {{in connection with the}} celebrations was held at the Infant Jesus Cathedral at Tangasseri at 4 p.m. A 140-member choir added colour to the high mass. On the occasion, the Bishop conferred Papal recognitions on seven members of the laity from the diocese.

50|$|Meanwhile, {{the train}} is {{repeatedly}} delayed, much to the befuddlement of an older English couple (Anita Sharp-Bolster and Michael Trubshawe). They are first displaced from their first class compartment {{to make way for}} a prize-winning goat. Then, they have to share their new compartment with lobsters intended for the <b>bishop's</b> <b>golden</b> jubilee. Finally, the bar receives a phone call asking that the train add on another car needed to accommodate a hurling team whose bus has broken down nearby after a match. When the English couple finally get off for some tea, they are left behind when the train finally departs.|$|R
