5|$|Small {{pieces of}} gold foil {{featuring}} engravings dating from the Migration Period into the early Viking Age (known as gullgubber) have been discovered in various locations in Scandinavia, almost 2,500 at one location. The foil pieces have been found largely at sites of buildings, only rarely in graves. The figures are sometimes single, occasionally an animal, sometimes {{a man and a}} woman with a leafy bough between them, facing or embracing one another. The human figures are almost always clothed and are sometimes depicted with their <b>knees</b> <b>bent.</b> Scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson says that it has been suggested that the figures are partaking in a dance, and that they may have been connected with weddings, as well as linked to the Vanir group of gods, representing the notion of a divine marriage, such as in the Poetic Edda poem Skírnismál; the coming together of Gerðr and Freyr.|$|E
25|$|The hips {{should be}} relaxed and the rider should lean {{forwards}} slightly {{with the movement}} of the horse. In cross country, the rider tends {{to stay out of the}} saddle and be standing up with their <b>knees</b> <b>bent</b> and the upper body leaning over the horse's withers. The heel of the rider should be in line with their shoulders and then the back of their riding hat in dressage to make the canter look neat.|$|E

500|$|With {{an exaggerated}} and unusual batting style, Bagwell waited for each pitch {{in a low}} crouch, with legs wide open and <b>knees</b> <b>bent</b> nearly 90 degrees, {{appearing}} {{as if he was}} sitting on an invisible bench. [...] He stepped back with his front foot as he began his swing. [...] Next, he would rise from his stance and rotate his hands with the bat forward into his powerful, uppercut swing. [...] "That wide stance keeps him from over striding", Joe Torre observed, [...] "which can be your biggest problem when you’re trying to hit for power." [...] The low crouch also shrunk his strike zone, allowing him to walk more often. [...] Standing 6 feet tall (...) and weighing , he did not present the image of an imposing, home run-hitting giant that would cause pitchers to be very careful when he batted after he began his major league career.|$|E
500|$|Bruegel based {{the work}} on the Biblical parable of the blind leading the blind from Matthew 15:14, in which Christ refers to the Pharisees. [...] According to art critic Margaret Sullivan, Bruegel's {{audience}} was likely as familiar with classical literature as with the Bible. Erasmus had published his Adagia two years before Bruegel's painting, and it contained the quotation [...] "" [...] ("the blind leader of the blind") by Roman poet Horace. [...] Bruegel expands the two blind men in the parable to six; they are well dressed, rather than wearing the peasant clothing that typifies his late work. [...] The first blind man's face is not visible; the second twists his head as he falls, perhaps to avoid landing face-first. The shinguard-clad third man, on his toes with <b>knees</b> <b>bent</b> and face to the sky, shares a staff with the second, by which he is being pulled down. The others have yet to stumble, but the same fate seems implied.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{successful}} attempts at walking robots {{tended to have}} six legs. The number of legs was reduced as microprocessor technology advanced, and there are now a number of robots that can walk on two legs. [...] One, for example, is ASIMO. [...] Although robots have taken great strides in advancement, they still don't walk nearly as well as human beings as they often need to keep their <b>knees</b> <b>bent</b> permanently {{in order to improve}} stability.|$|E

2500|$|Shorter {{stirrups}} {{require a}} rider {{to keep the}} <b>knees</b> <b>bent</b> at a greater angle. When riding in a short stirrup, the rider {{has the ability to}} partially stand up and get the seat clear of the saddle. This allows more mobility than a longer stirrup would, but at the cost of having less feel of the horse and less security. It is a position designed to help the horse achieve greater speed, and also allows the rider greater physical mobility in the saddle. When riding with short stirrups, the rider often adopts what is known as a forward seat, thus inhibiting the horse's balance and athletic maneuverings as little as possible. In the past, this style was preferred by light cavalry. These fighters required speed and needed the flexibility to turn their own bodies in any direction to use light weapons such as the bow, javelin, short swords, and later, the rifle and pistol. The horsemen of Central Asia, such as the Mongols, used this type of stirrup, as did the Islamic Bedouin and Moors of the Middle East and North Africa. Historically, this type of stirrup adjustment and the seat it produced was called la jineta. Modern Jockeys, eventers, and show jumping riders use this type of stirrup, as do some cowboys when performing certain jobs that require a forward position to allow agility of horse and rider, such as calf roping ...|$|E

60|$|Neither saw Thirlwell.

Stormont, indeed, made a better fight than Thirlwell had expected, but after a time his <b>knees</b> <b>bent,</b> his head went back, and Drummond threw him heavily.
