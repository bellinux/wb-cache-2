The follow-up report, Natrelle Saline-filled Breast Implants: a Prospective 10-year Study (2009) indicated rupture-deflation rates of 3–5 per cent at 3-years post-implantation, and 7–10 per cent rupture-deflation rates at 10-years post-implantation.|$|E

On US, HCC often appears as a small hypoechoic lesion with poorly defined margins and coarse irregular internal echoes. When the tumor grows, it can sometimes appear heterogeneous with fibrosis, fatty change, and calcifications. This heterogeneity can look similar to cirrhosis and the surrounding liver parenchyma. A systematic review found that the sensitivity was 60 percent (95% CI 44-76%) and specificity was 97 percent (95% CI 95-98%) compared with pathologic examination of an <b>explanted</b> or resected liver as the reference standard.

Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 0. 1 mg/L NAA (1 -naphthaleneacetic acid) and 1 mg/L BA (6 -benzyladenine) showed the maximum shoot regeneration frequency (56. 67 %) among the different combinations of NAA and BA. <b>Explant</b> type, <b>explant</b> age, and addition of AgNO 3 also significantly affected shoot regeneration. Of the four type of <b>explants</b> (cotyledon, hypocotyl, root, and leaf <b>explants)</b> - cotyledon <b>explants</b> produced the highest shoot regeneration frequency and hypocotyls <b>explants</b> produced the highest number of shoots per <b>explant,</b> whereas root <b>explants</b> did not produce any shoot. The cotyledonary <b>explants</b> from Four-day-old seedlings showed the maximum shoot regeneration frequency and number of shoots per <b>explant.</b> Shoot regeneration frequency increased significantly by adding AgNO 3 to the medium.

For morphogenic callus induction and proliferation from various <b>explants,</b> MS medium supplemented with 3. 0 mg/l 2, 4 -D was highly efficient with 100 % callus induction frequency from inter-nodal <b>explants.</b> Leaf <b>explants</b> showed quicker response than nodal and inter-modal <b>explants,</b> for callus initiation within 6 days of inoculation. Best grown callus was obtained from leaf <b>explant.</b> The leaf-derived callus was maintained up to several weeks, which indicated that 8 -week incubation period was the most suitable for obtaining well proliferated, morphogenic callus. Temperature variation also affected the growth of in vitro induced morphogenic callus from various <b>explants.</b> Results have shown that 27 ˚C {{proved to be the}} best temperature for morphogenic callus induction and proliferation from leaf and inter-nodal <b>explants.</b> Among the auxin-cytokinin combination, MS medium containing 1. 0 mg/l N(6) -benzylaminopurin (BAP) and 2. 0 mg/l NAA showed the highest efficiency of callus initiation and proliferation from leaf, nodal and inter-nodal <b>explants.</b> Ligh...|$|R
40|$|Bulb size is an {{important}} factor determining phase change in Lilium: phase change only occurs in bulblets over a certain threshold weight. After phase change has occurred, bulblets sprout with a stem with many leaves. Juvenile bulblets sprout with only a few leaves. The factors contributing to bulb size were studied during in vitro regeneration of bulblets on scale segments. The larger the <b>explants,</b> the larger the regenerated bulblets. <b>Explant</b> size influenced bulb growth during the complete culture period. Bulb growth was stimulated by a high sucrose concentration. The contribution of the medium and the <b>explant</b> reserves to bulb growth were studied in large and small <b>explants</b> using labelled sucrose. Sucrose was mainly taken up through the cut surfaces. In freshly cut <b>explants,</b> the rate of uptake was correlated with the size of the contact area, but at later stages, when regenerating organs were present, the difference in uptake rate of small and large <b>explants</b> almost disappeared. Small <b>explants</b> had a larger sink activity than large ones. <b>Explants</b> with regenerating organs took up more sucrose than freshly cut <b>explants.</b> Sucrose uptake and bulb growth were rather constant in the later phases and doubled when the sucrose concentration was doubled. Partitioning of label from the sucrose over the various organs, was also rather constant in time: approximately 25 % was accumulated in the bulblets, 35 - 45 % in the <b>explant</b> and 30 - 35 % was converted to CO 2. About half of the label in the <b>explant</b> was recovered at the proximal side where regeneration takes place. Sucrose, once incorporated in the storage pools in the <b>explant,</b> either remained in the <b>explant</b> or was converted to CO 2. Redistribution to the growing bulblets hardly occurred. The percentage of bulb growth that could be attributed to uptake of medium components was constant over the regeneration period: 45 - 50 % for large and 65 - 75 % for small <b>explants...</b>|$|R
