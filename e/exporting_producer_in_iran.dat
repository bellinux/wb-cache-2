World peanut production is around 30 million tonnes, with China, USA, Argentina and India as major <b>export</b> <b>producers.</b> <b>In</b> Africa, the largest producers are Nigeria (2, 800, 000 t), Sudan (980, 000 t) and Senegal (828, 000 t). Peanuts are in fact grown in most ACP countries. Research on improved peanut varieties has {{for a long time}} been dormant, but the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), seems to be quickly making up for this (see also Spore 91). For the past decade, research on groundnuts has focused on varieties that are suited for local conditions, such as drought, poor soils and a range of pests and diseases. In Africa, leaf spot, aflatoxine contamination, groundnut rosette and foliar disease often lead to considerable harvest losses. In West Africa, ICRISAT has been releasing numerous disease-resistant varieties for testing among farmers. In Samanko, almost literally the back garden of the ICRISAT centre in Mali, a women s group has been successfully testing some of these varieties. In ideal conditions, a peanut harvest can amount to three tonnes per hectare but traditional varieties in Mali do not yield more than 500 kg/ha. In the tests, some new varieties are yielding more than 1 tonne/ha and are maturing in only 90 days instead of 115 days traditionally. The women determine which varieties pass the test and will be distributed to other regions. They have rejected certain lines of varieties with promising high yields, for one that has more attractive seeds or is more suitable for their goats. It is, ICRISAT tell us, the women who are the major players. That, they say, is what participation is all about. We look forward to the women s side of the story!

Responding {{to a lack of}} empirically grounded literature, the paper focuses on involvement by the National Smallholder Farmers' Association of Malawi (NASFAM) with two dedicated fair trade marketing networks. Based on qualitative case study research, analysis shows that dedicated fair trade organisations have {{played a significant role in}} promoting export diversification: particularly through the facilitation of market access and provision of the financial, social and physical capital needed to support such changes.

Statistical analysis showed that there was no Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for average genotypic frequencies of different herds. Overall, the lack of equilibrium seems to be due to preference of AB genotype in the studied populations which could be as a result of selection that normally would apply in commercial herds.

On the other hand, exports in industry sector can be a noticeable point for the economic growth of any country. Enhancing the exports of the steel industry of the country can have a principal role in the economic pursuit of the country’s non-oil products. Such an enhancement brings about a positive effect in the efficiency of the stocks within the financial markets by developing the steel industry. Researchers of this field claim that privatization in the steel industry results in the further development of the steel stock market and exports.

The technical panel of the study consisted of 27 hazelnut production in Eastern Guilan. The factor “observing engineering principles {{in the construction of}} new hazelnut orchards (row planting at appropriate density) ” was identified as the most important driving factor with about 99 % consensus from experts.

There are concerns that the proliferation and enhanced stringency of standards that are imposed by high-income countries can negatively affect the competitiveness of <b>producers</b> <b>in</b> developing countries and impede actors from entering or even remaining in high-value food markets. Yet, in some cases, others argue that such standards can play a positive role, providing the catalyst and incentives for the modernization of export supply and regulatory systems and the adoption of safer and more sustainable production practices. This article provides an empirical analysis of EU private food-safety standards impact on pesticide use and farm-level productivity among smallholder <b>export</b> vegetable <b>producers</b> <b>in</b> Kenya. We apply an extended three-stage damage control production framework that accounts for multiple endogeneity problems to farm-level data collected from a random cross-section sample of 439 small-scale vegetable producers. Estimation results show that <b>export</b> <b>producers</b> complying with private standards significantly use less toxic pesticides; however {{there is no significant}} difference on the total quantity of pesticides used. Contrary to findings elsewhere, the econometric evidences here show that export vegetable farmers in Kenya use pesticide below the economic optimum. The third stage structural revenue model results demonstrate a positive and significant impact of standards adoption on revenue of vegetable production. While food safety and quality standards can be a barrier for resource poor smallholders to maintain their position in the lucrative export markets, they can also induce positive changes in production systems of small-scale farmers who adopt it as shown by the results presented. Generally this article partly supports the notion that adoption of emerging food-safety standards can serve as a catalyst in transforming the production systems of developing countries towards safer and more sustainable production.

40|$|This study {{analytically}} {{shows that}} a VER serves as an institution to protect incumbent firms of an exporting country. A VER is an entry barrier in the export market. It favours the concentration of industry, and allows established firms to better exploit economies of scale by producing output at lower average cost. Since the break-even price for potential firms is the average cost, entry in the domestic market is also inhibited, regardless of the form of competition. A VER also allows the raising of the price cost margin in the export market. However, the smaller the country, the greater the possibility also of a larger monopoly power in the domestic market. The impact on firm size is ambiguous. From the social point of view, three conventional effects from the elimination of a VER are usually considered: the rent loss effect, the efficiency effect and the <b>export</b> <b>producer</b> price effect. <b>In</b> this study, two further effects on welfare are examined: the increased intermediate inputs cost effect and the variety effect. The global effect on welfare on an exporting country is analytically indeterminate. A general equilibrium model applied to Turkey supports the conjecture that with the elimination of a VER, under Bertrand or Cournot conjectures, the loss in social welfare, the higher average cost, {{the fall of the}} concentration of the industry, and the fall of monopoly power of incumbent firms, are the key elements in understanding the rationale beyond VERs.
