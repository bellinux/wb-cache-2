5|$|Heydrich {{opened the}} conference with {{an account of}} the anti-Jewish {{measures}} taken in Germany since the Nazi seizure of power in 1933. He said that between 1933 and October 1941, 537,000 German, Austrian, and Czech <b>Jews</b> <b>had</b> emigrated. This information was taken from a briefing paper prepared for him the previous week by Eichmann.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1920, and {{continuing}} until the 1960s, McGill imposed a controversial quota which specified a maximum on {{the proportion of}} newly admitted students who were Jewish. Up until that point <b>Jews</b> <b>had</b> been overrepresented in the university, especially in the arts (20% Jewish) and law (40% Jewish). The quota limited the Jewish population across McGill to at most 10%.|$|E
5|$|During Tiberius' reign <b>Jews</b> <b>had</b> {{become more}} {{prominent}} in Rome and Jewish and Gentile followers of Jesus began proselytizing Roman citizens, increasing long-simmering resentments. Tiberius in 19 AD ordered Jews who were of military age {{to join the}} Roman Army. Tiberius banished {{the rest of the}} Jews from Rome and threatened to enslave them for life if they did not leave the city.|$|E

5000|$|Knickerbocker {{was noted}} for {{reporting}} on German politics {{before and during}} World War II. From 1923 to 1933 he reported from Berlin, but because of his opposition to Hitler he was deported when Hitler came to power. Back in America, he continued writing about {{the threat posed by}} Nazism. On April 15, 1933, he wrote in the New York Evening Post: [...] "An indeterminate number of <b>Jews</b> <b>have</b> been killed. Hundreds of <b>Jews</b> <b>have</b> been beaten or tortured. Thousands of <b>Jews</b> <b>have</b> fled. Thousands of <b>Jews</b> <b>have</b> been, or will be, deprived of their livelihood." [...] In 1931, as a correspondent for the New York Evening Post and the Philadelphia Public Ledger, he won the Pulitzer Prize for [...] "a series of articles on the practical operation of the Five Year Plan in Russia".|$|R
50|$|In recent years, some Honduran <b>Jews</b> <b>have</b> made aliyah to Israel.|$|R
5|$|Racism and {{antisemitism}} were basic {{tenets of}} the Nazi Party and the Nazi government. Discrimination and violent attacks against Jews began immediately after the seizure of power in 1933. Violence and economic pressure were used by the Nazis to encourage Jews to voluntarily leave the country. By 1939, around 250,000 of Germany's 437,000 <b>Jews</b> <b>had</b> emigrated to the United States, Argentina, the United Kingdom, Palestine, and other countries.|$|E
5|$|The mass {{deportation}} of Hungarian <b>Jews</b> <b>had</b> already {{stopped by}} the time of the leak. Following publication in mid-June of parts of the Vrba-Wetzler report, describing the use of gas chambers inside Auschwitz, the Jewish Agency in Geneva had cabled London asking that Hungarian ministers be held personally responsible for the killings. The cable was intercepted and passed to Hungarian regent Miklós Horthy, who ordered an end to the deportations on 7 July.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{position}} of the Christians and Jews of the empire became increasingly apparent. The <b>Jews</b> <b>had</b> earned imperial toleration {{on account of the}} great antiquity of their faith. They had been exempted from Decius's persecution and continued to enjoy freedom from persecution under Tetrarchic government. Because their faith was new and unfamiliar and not typically identified with Judaism by this time, Christians had no such excuse. Moreover, Christians had been distancing themselves from their Jewish heritage for their entire history.|$|E

50|$|The {{commission}} {{also reported}} that, 34% of the French population consider Islam as something negative, and 50% of them {{consider it a}} menace against national identity. In addition, 41% of the population believe that <b>Jews</b> <b>have</b> a singular relationship with money and 20% of them believe that <b>Jews</b> <b>have</b> too much power in France.|$|R

5|$|Throughout June {{and into}} July 1944, {{material}} from the Vrba–Wetzler and earlier reports appeared in newspapers and radio broadcasts in the United States and Europe, particularly in Switzerland, prompting world leaders to appeal to Hungarian regent Miklós Horthy to halt the deportations. On 7 July 1944, Horthy ordered an end to them, possibly fearing he would be held responsible after the war. By then 437,000 <b>Jews</b> <b>had</b> been deported, constituting almost the entire Jewish population of the Hungarian countryside, but another 200,000 in Budapest were saved.|$|E
5|$|Weizmann {{had argued}} that the {{declaration}} would have three effects: it would swing Russia to maintain pressure on Germany's Eastern Front, since <b>Jews</b> <b>had</b> been prominent in the March Revolution of 1917; it would rally the large Jewish community in the United States to press for greater funding for the American war effort, underway since April of that year; and, lastly, that it would undermine German Jewish support for Kaiser Wilhelm II.|$|E
5|$|A {{consensus}} formed {{within the}} European diplomatic community in Constantinople that {{the persecution of}} the accused <b>Jews</b> <b>had</b> to be stopped. This opinion was held not only by Lord Ponsonby, but also by von Stürmer, whose correspondence revealed {{that he was not}} at all convinced of the innocence of the Jews; by the French ambassador Edouard Pontois, whose government stood by the French consuls who supported blood libels in Rhodes and Damascus; and by the Prussian ambassador Hans von Königsmark. Consequently, the way was open for Lord Ponsonby, by far the most powerful diplomat in Constantinople, to intervene unopposed on behalf the Jews of Rhodes.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Jew</b> <b>has</b> emancipated {{himself in}} a Jewish manner, not only because he has {{acquired}} financial power, but also because, through him and also apart from him, money has become a world power and the practical Jewish spirit has become the practical spirit of the Christian nations. The <b>Jews</b> <b>have</b> emancipated themselves insofar as the Christians <b>have</b> become <b>Jews.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Gerald Krefetz writes [...] "whether it {{is called}} {{intestinal}} fortitude, operation bootstrap, moxie, social striving, or upward mobility, American <b>Jews</b> <b>have</b> fought mightily for financial security. ...

5|$|By mid-July Wiesenthal {{and other}} Jewish {{residents}} had to register to do forced labour. Within six months, in November 1941 the Nazis {{had set up}} the Lwów Ghetto using Jewish forced labour. All <b>Jews</b> <b>had</b> {{to give up their}} homes and move there, a process completed in the following months. Several thousand Jews were murdered in Lvov by Ukrainian nationals and German Einsatzgruppen in June and July 1941. In his autobiographies, Wiesenthal tells how he was arrested on 6 July, but saved from execution by his former foreman, a man named Bodnar, who was now a member of the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police. There are several versions of the story, which may be apocryphal.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Eichmann {{was posted}} to Vienna to help organise Jewish {{emigration}} from Austria, which {{had just been}} integrated into the Reich through the Anschluss. Jewish community organisations were placed under supervision of the SD and tasked with encouraging and facilitating Jewish emigration. Funding came from money seized from other Jewish people and organisations, as well as donations from overseas, which were placed under SD control. Eichmann was promoted to SS-Obersturmführer (first lieutenant) in July 1938, and appointed to the Central Agency for Jewish Emigration in Vienna, created in August. By {{the time he left}} Vienna in May 1939, nearly 100,000 <b>Jews</b> <b>had</b> left Austria legally, and many more had been smuggled out to Palestine and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Shostakovich {{acquired}} {{a book of}} Jewish folk songs, and from this he composed the song cycle From Jewish Folk Poetry. He initially wrote eight songs that were meant to represent the hardships of being Jewish in the Soviet Union. However in order to disguise this, Shostakovich ended up adding three more songs meant to demonstrate the great life <b>Jews</b> <b>had</b> under the Soviet regime. Despite his efforts to hide the real meaning in the work, the Union of Composers refused to approve his music in 1949 {{under the pressure of}} the anti-Semitism that gripped the country. From Jewish Folk Poetry could not be performed until after Stalin’s death in March 1953, along with all the other works that were forbidden.|$|E

5|$|In June 1943 he {{was given}} the job of {{registrar}} in the quarantine section at Birkenau sector BII, which allowed him to speak to deportees selected as slave labour. He had his own office with a desk, chair and bunk bed. From the window he could see the lorries driving towards the gas chambers, and estimated that 10 percent of each transport was selected to work and the rest killed. By April 1944 he calculated that 1,750,000 <b>Jews</b> <b>had</b> been killed, a figure higher than that accepted by historians, but which decades later he still insisted was accurate.|$|E
5|$|Sunshine (1999)—a three-hour {{historical}} epic, and an English-language, international co-production—was {{viewed by}} many critics as Szabó’s most ambitious film, and, along with Mephisto, his most important. Hungary’s <b>Jews</b> <b>had</b> figured in either a marginal or coded fashion in several of Szabó’s earlier films, produced during the socialist period when discourse around {{the history of the}} country’s Jews was more circumscribed. In Sunshine, for the first time, Szabó focused explicitly on this aspect of Hungarian history, which he himself had experienced as a child during the Arrow Cross dictatorship. Ralph Fiennes plays three generations in the Sonnenschein family as they experience the trials of twentieth-century Hungarian Jewish history, from the late Austro-Hungarian Empire through the Holocaust to the 1956 Revolution.|$|E
5|$|That {{changed at}} midnight on Sunday, 18 March 1944, with the {{invasion}} of Hungary by Nazi Germany, and the arrival in Budapest of SS-Obersturmbannführer Adolf Eichmann to oversee the deportation of the country's Jews. From 5 April Jews {{over the age of}} six had to wear a 10x10cm (3.8x3.8in) yellow badge on the upper-left side of their coats or jackets. <b>Jews</b> <b>had</b> to declare the value of their property, and were forbidden from moving home, travelling, owning cars or radios, listening to foreign radio stations, or using the telephone. Jewish authors could no longer be published, their books were removed from libraries, and Jewish civil servants, journalists and lawyers were sacked.|$|E

5|$|The British, Americans and Soviet Union {{discussed}} the proposal. British Foreign Secretary (later Prime Minister) Anthony Eden wrote a memo on 26 June outlining the options. The British were convinced {{they were dealing}} with a Himmler trick, perhaps an attempt to broker a peace deal without the Soviet Union. If the deal had gone ahead and large numbers of <b>Jews</b> <b>had</b> been released in central Europe, Allied airborne and possibly land-based military operations might have had to stop. Bauer believes the British feared this was Himmler's motive– to turn the Jews into human shields– because it would have allowed the Germans to devote their forces to fighting the Red Army.|$|E
5|$|The first convoy from Belgium, {{carrying}} stateless Jews, left Mechelen {{transit camp}} for Auschwitz on 4 August 1942 {{and was soon}} followed by others. These trains left for extermination camps in Eastern Europe. Between October 1942 and January 1943, deportations were temporarily halted; by this time 16,600 people have been deported on 17 rail convoys. As the result of Queen Elisabeth's intervention with the German authorities, all of those deported in this first wave were not Belgian citizens. In 1943, the deportations resumed. By the time that deportations to extermination camps had begun, however, nearly 2,250 Belgian <b>Jews</b> <b>had</b> already been deported as forced laborers for , a civil and military engineering group, which {{was working on the}} construction of the Atlantic Wall in Northern France.|$|E
5|$|The {{types of}} prisoners were {{distinguishable}} by triangular pieces of cloth, called Winkel, sewn onto on their jackets below their prisoner number. Political prisoners had a red triangle, Jehovah's Witnesses had purple, criminals had green, and so on. The nationality of the inmate was indicated by a letter stitched onto the Winkel. <b>Jews</b> <b>had</b> a yellow triangle, overlaid {{by a second}} Winkel if they also fit into a second category. Uniquely at Auschwitz, prisoners were tattooed with their prisoner number, on the chest for Soviet prisoners of war and on the left arm for civilians.|$|E
