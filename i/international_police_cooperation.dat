The police serve as border guards for the outer border of the Schengen Area. The busiest are Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, which has 130 man-years tied to it, Storskog on the Russian border and Sandefjord Airport, Torp. These are the only borders with designated border employees—all other are manned with regular officers. The police is not responsible for customs, which {{is the responsibility of}} the Norwegian Customs and Excise Authorities. Norway participates in a series of <b>international</b> <b>police</b> <b>cooperation,</b> such as Interpol, Europol, the Schengen Information System, Frontex, and the Baltic Sea Task Force on Organized Crime. Norway also has a close cooperation with the other Nordic police forces. The Norwegian Police Service occasionally participates in international operations.|$|E

It conducts management and supervision of the specialist agencies and police districts, including organizational development and support activities. The directorate {{is led by the}} National Police Commissioner, who, since 2012, has been Odd Reidar Humlegård. The National Criminal Investigation Service is a national unit which works with organized and serious crime. It both works as an assistant unit for police districts, with special focus on technical and tactical investigation, in addition to being responsible on its own for organized crime. It acts as the center for <b>international</b> <b>police</b> <b>cooperation,</b> including participation in Interpol and Europol. The National Authority for Investigation and Prosecution of Economic and Environmental Crime is responsible for complex cases of economic crime and acts as a public prosecutor for those cases. The National Police Immigration Service registers and identifies asylum seekers and returns those which have their applications rejected. The National Mobile Police Service is based in Stavern and operates throughout the country. Their primary role is as highway patrol and manages the police reserves, although they also assist police districts in extraordinary events where extra manpower is needed or where they are in the vicinity.|$|E

40|$|Globalization {{presents}} an important opportunity for police and justice officials {{around the world}} to cooperate with one another to bring offenders of serious transnational organized crime to justice. Numerous trends and developments are emerging in Europe—especially in the cross-border Meuse–Rhine Euregion, where the three countries of Belgium, The Netherlands, and Germany meet. Indeed, the police and justice officials of the Meuse–Rhine Euregion are acknowledged as the “pioneers” of routine cross-border <b>police</b> and judicial <b>cooperation,</b> and due to various factors, their work is arguably among the most long-standing, advanced, and intense in the world. Despite an expanding legal framework, however, operational problems still arise in practice. Therefore, one question becomes: how may <b>international</b> <b>police</b> and judicial <b>cooperation</b> in the Meuse–Rhine Euregion be improved? The Meuse–Rhine Euregion frames this multi-site case study, which uses the Organizational Behavior (OB) approach to examine the state-of-the-art. Specifically, the analysis of scholarly literature, international law, and in-depth personal interviews with 44 English-speaking police detectives, senior police commanders, prosecutors, and examining magistrates from 21 organizations across the three countries in this Euregion provides the data to answer this study’s four main research questions, namely: (1) What is the status quo with respect to <b>international</b> <b>police</b> and judicial <b>cooperation</b> aimed at combating serious transnational organized crime in the Meuse–Rhine Euregion, according to police and justice officials?; (2) How does the process of <b>international</b> <b>police</b> and judicial <b>cooperation</b> aimed at combating serious transnational organized crime in the Meuse–Rhine Euregion operate in practice, according to police and justice officials?; (3) What variables affect (facilitate/impede) <b>international</b> <b>police</b> and judicial <b>cooperation</b> aimed at combating serious transnational organized crime in the Meuse–Rhine Euregion, according to police and justice officials?; and (4) How can <b>international</b> <b>police</b> and judicial <b>cooperation</b> aimed at combating serious transnational organized crime in the Meuse–Rhine Euregion be improved? The findings of this study may help improve <b>international</b> <b>police</b> and judicial <b>cooperation</b> in the Meuse–Rhine Euregion, and inspire similar cooperative efforts around the world...|$|R

40|$|With {{the coming}} into force of the Treaty on European Union in 1993, <b>police</b> <b>cooperation</b> gained a solid {{position}} on the European political agenda. Since then the EU Council has adopted {{a significant number of}} policy instruments aimed at enhancing <b>police</b> <b>cooperation</b> between the EU Member States. But what has been the effect of these instruments on the practices of <b>police</b> <b>cooperation,</b> and how can differences in effect be explained? These two questions guide this doctoral study that investigates 70 instruments adopted by the EU Council between 1995 and 2004. Data for the field research was collected from numerous Council documents and interviews with police practitioners, and was analyzed using both quantitative and qualitative techniques. This book presents the findings of the study, starting with an examination of key concepts related to <b>police</b> <b>cooperation</b> in Europe. It goes on to discuss academic literature on <b>police</b> <b>cooperation,</b> to give an overview of relevant developments in <b>police</b> <b>cooperation</b> practice in Europe and a detailed description of EU Council policy-making on <b>police</b> <b>cooperation.</b> The findings of the field research indicate that, in the shaping of EU Council policy instruments aimed at enhancing <b>police</b> <b>cooperation,</b> it is important to elevate substance (professional rationality) over form (legal nature) ...|$|R

The evolution of regulatory trends and cooperation models is analysed for both systems and possible transferable strategies identified. Drawing on interviews with practitioners in the EU and Australia this book highlights {{a number of areas}} where the EU can be compared to a federal system and addresses {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} being a Union or a federation of states with a view to <b>police</b> <b>cooperation</b> practice. Particular topics addressed are the evolution of legal frameworks regulating <b>police</b> <b>cooperation,</b> informal cooperation strategies, Joint Investigation Teams, Europol and regional cooperation.

This master thesis focuses on the coordination of <b>police</b> <b>cooperation</b> from the Czech Republic's point of view. The objective is to interpret the coordination mechanism in the Czech Republic and to analyse its level of centralization and the method of management. For this purpose, theories of liberal intergovernmental approach and institutionalism are engaged. The partial objective is to examine the influence of Europeanization on the coordination mechanism. Analysis is carried out on a systemic level, connecting the national and European coordination levels. The coordination mechanism of European <b>police</b> <b>cooperation</b> in the Czech Republic proved to be quite centralized with some decentralized elements and hierarchical management structure.

40|$|This article {{critically}} {{examines the}} practice, methods, and regulation of cross-border <b>police</b> <b>cooperation</b> between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Despite {{legal and political}} divisions, <b>police</b> <b>cooperation</b> has survived and flourished in recent years especially among police officers on the ground. By comparison, the development of transparent regulatory and accountability structures and processes has been disappointing. While there have been domestic initiatives at the intergovernmental and legislative levels, these have tended to emphasize the centrality of direct engagement between the police chiefs and senior civil servants {{at the expense of}} formal transparent procedures. EU instruments have been marginalized as the police forces and their administrations prefer informal networks and force-to-force agreements which, it is argued, shield cross-border <b>police</b> <b>cooperation</b> from standards of transparency, oversight, and accountability which are essential to its legitimacy. They also highlight the limitations of the current EU legislative approach to cross-border <b>police</b> <b>cooperation...</b>|$|R
