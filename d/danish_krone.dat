5|$|The airline started {{negotiating}} a charter contract {{agreement with the}} Danish tour operator Spies Rejser in July 1970. Trans Polar offered the operator the use of two Boeing 720s for 55 million <b>Danish</b> <b>krone</b> (DKK), 10 million lower than the incumbent Scanair was bidding, which would allow Spies to transport 140,000 of their annual 250,000 passengers. As the first aircraft was bound to existing operations, Trans Polar would have to procure two additional aircraft for the contract, as well as receive operating permission in Denmark. Trans Polar and Spies signed a contract in mid-August for one weekly service from Copenhagen to Gran Canaria, while another weekly contract was awarded to Maersk Air. Negotiations for the main contract started on 5 September; Scanair had stated a minimum price it could accept, largely {{based on the fact}} that Spies did not have an alternative operator. The successful negotiations with Trans Polar also included an agreement with Spantax, who each could offer Spies 70,000 seats for the season. The contract brought annual revenue of DKK25 million to Trans Polar. To fly the operations, two ex-Aer Lingus Boeing 720s were registered on 16 October. The company later signed agreements with the Danish tour operators Karavan-rejser and Danmarks Internasjonale Studentkomite (DIS).|$|E
5|$|To {{communicate}} with his handlers, Lody {{was instructed to}} write to certain addresses in Christiania (now Oslo), Stockholm, New York City and Rome. He acquired an American emergency passport {{in the name of}} Charles A.Inglis, a genuine document obtained from the US Embassy in Berlin. When Germany declared war on Russia on 1 August, newly imposed restrictions prevented foreigners from leaving Germany without travel documents. Embassies and consulates throughout the country experienced a rush of visitors as foreigners sought emergency passports; these had to be submitted to the German Foreign Ministry to obtain exit permits for neutral Denmark or the Netherlands. One such applicant was the real Charles A. Inglis, whose passport went missing– lost, it was claimed, although in fact the Foreign Ministry had appropriated it for Lody's use. As the passport lacked security features such as the holder's photograph or fingerprints, being merely a single-sheet document, it was well-suited for use by a spy. Lody said later that he had received it in the post from his superiors atN. He was also given £250 in British banknotes, 1,000 <b>Danish</b> <b>krone</b> and 1,000 Norwegian krone to finance his mission to the UK, where he would travel via Denmark and Norway.|$|E

Unemployment was very low, and the Faroese were enjoying one of the world's highest standards of living, but the Faroese economy was almost entirely reliant on fishing. The early 1990s saw a dramatic slump in fish stocks, which were being overfished with new high-tech equipment. During the same period the government was also engaged in massive overspending. National debt was now at 9.4 billion <b>Danish</b> <b>krones</b> (DKK). Finally, in October 1992, the Faroese national bank (Sjóvinnurbankin) called in receivers {{and was forced to}} ask Denmark for a huge financial bailout. The initial sum was 500 million DKK, though this eventually grew to 1.8 billion DKK (this was in addition to the annual grant of 1 billion DKK). Austerity measures were introduced: public spending was cut, there was a tax and VAT increase and public employees were given a 10% wage-cut. Much of the fishing industry was put into receivership, with talk of cutting down the number of fish-farms and ships.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Inside, on 19 July 2016, Patti left the company, selling his shares to Jensen. Patti felt that he was leaving Playdead [...] "in a state where it can {{definitely}} manage itself", and stated [...] "Following almost 10 incredible years building Playdead from an idea to two dents in the games industry, I'm leaving to seek new challenges." [...] Danish newspaper Dagbladet Børsen reported that a rift had developed between Patti and Jensen around 2015, that Patti described to Kotaku as [...] "the supposed timeline for the next project(s) and where I am in my life now". The rift led to Jensen submitting a resignation letter to Patti from his position as creative director, though intending to stay on as a company executive. The letter had been misinterpreted by Patti as a full resignation from the company, and he subsequently removed Jensen's name from the Central Business Register for Playdead. This led to confrontation between the two and their representative lawyers that required intervention of the Danish Business Authority to resolve. This ultimately led to Patti being forced to take a payout of 50 million <b>Danish</b> <b>krones</b> (about [...] ) for his shares. Patti was disappointed on the way his involvement with Playdead ended, but said that [...] "Arnt has been a really good friend and business partner for many years".

5000|$|Robinson Ekspeditionen 2011 (also {{known as}} Robinson: All or Nothing) was the fourteenth {{season of the}} Danish version of the Swedish {{television}} series Expedition Robinson. This season premiered on September 5, 2011. The first twist this season was that the tribe that lost the first immunity challenge was {{to be forced to}} live on the desolate side of the island while the winning tribe lived on a side of the island that had many luxuries and comforts. The only thing separating the two tribes was a wall. The losing tribe was also forced {{to take part in a}} large elimination in which half of the tribe will be eliminated from the game (this was later revealed to be a trick as the four people voted out switched tribes). Among the contestants this season will be siblings Karina Andersen and Maria Bruun, who'll be on the same tribe but will keep their relationship a secret from the other contestants. As another twist, this year there was no [...] "Utopia", instead eliminated contestants may be sent to [...] "Guardian Island". On the island eliminated contestants will be forced to battle three guardians of a golden skull for a spot on the island. In episode 2 the two cousins, Hugo and Morten Kleister, entered the game as jokers and joined the recently cut-in-half North team. In episode 3, another joker, Mie Deichmann Jørgensen, also joined the North team, thought shortly after she was voted out of the game. In the same episode another joker, Daniel Broner Jensen, entered the game as a member of the South team, though he too was voted out shortly after due to his poor relationship with some of the other South team members (specifically Allan). In episode 6, the remaining contestants were asked if they wanted to switch tribes. While only Louise Valbjørn opted to do this, her move proved to be both strategic and game changing as she was able to successfully throw the immunity challenge to her old tribe and convince members of her new tribe to vote out Nima Alijana Hassanlouei. In episode 7, four more jokers, Kit Ruprecht, Marlene Thinggaard, Nicolai Barden, and Zabrina Kondrup, entered the game. Zabrina was well known for her participation in the previous season of Robinson. In episode 8, the guards protecting the golden skull were told that they had to [...] "curse" [...] a contestant. Said contestant would be given a mission to complete and if they failed they would automatically be eliminated from the competition. They chose Brigitte who ultimately passed her mission and was allowed to eliminate two of her fellow competitors (she chose Katrine and Kit). The final three contestants, Marlene Thinggaard and Hugo and Morten Kleister, took part in a final challenge which would determine the winner. Ultimately, Hugo Kleister beat out his cousin Morten and Marlene Thinggaard to win the grand prize of 250,000 <b>Danish</b> <b>krones.</b> At the end of the season, the three final guardians, all of whom had a key to the cage of the skull, took possession of the skull and with it half of the 500,000 krones prize to split among the four of them. This, however, would not have been true should the guardians have failed their final duel against Hugo, the actual winner of the season. Per faced Hugo in the final duel and won the 250,000 <b>Danish</b> <b>krones</b> for himself and fellow Guardians Patricia Beck, Tommy Kristensen, and Zabrina Kondrup.|$|R

25|$|Denmark faced {{some serious}} {{economic}} problems during the war. The Danish economy was fundamentally {{hurt by the}} rising cost of raw material imports such as coal and oil. Furthermore, Denmark lost its main trading partner at that point, the UK.

40|$|Utilising {{a unique}} data set on monthly private {{cross-border}} portfolio gross and net flows {{to and from}} Denmark 1984 - 2004 the paper analyses the short-term relationship between capital flows related to portfolio investments {{and changes in the}} <b>Danish</b> nominal <b>krone</b> rate vis- 0 -vis the euro (D-mark prior to 1999). The main finding is that portfolio investments are important to short-term exchange-rate determination and that the sign of the estimated effect is as expected: Net inflows of capital strengthen the exchange rate. This result is robust to divisions of the data sample into sub-periods {{as well as to the}} inclusion of central-bank interventions in the foreign-exchange market and changes in the short-term interest-rate spread vis- 0 -vis the currency anchor as endogenous explanatory variables. Portfolio flows in Danish bonds appear to be driving the results prior to the introduction of the euro. Since then the main driver has been portfolio investments in foreign shares. Over time there appears to have been a declining effect on the krone-rate from portfolio flows which might be seen as the result of increased credibility of the Danish exchange-rate peg...|$|R

By April, the airport had received notice that 100% security control would still have to be introduced, costing the municipality NOK465,000 per year. At the same time, Air Norway was still losing money, and applied to the municipality to not be charged landing fees at the airport. On 3 September 2007, the terminal was renovated for NOK1.8 million.

2500|$|The Danish {{authorities}} {{were able to}} use their more cooperative stance to win important concessions for the country. They continually refused to enter a customs and currency union with Germany. Danes were concerned both about the negative economic effects of the German proposals, as well as the political ones. German officials did not want to risk their special relationship with Denmark by forcing an agreement on them, as they had done in other countries. The Danish government was also able to stall negotiations over the return of South Jutland to Germany, ban [...] "closed-rank uniformed marches" [...] that would have made nationalist German or Danish Nazi agitation more possible, keep National Socialists out of the government, and hold a relatively free election, with decidedly anti-Nazi results, {{in the middle of the}} war. Danish military officials also had access to sensitive German information, which they delivered to the Allies under government cover. The economic consequences of the occupation were also mitigated by German-Danish cooperation. Inflation rose sharply in the first year of the war, as the German Army spent a large amount of German military currency in Denmark, most importantly on military installations and troop deployments. Due to the Occupation, the National Bank of Denmark was compelled to exchange German currency for Danish notes, effectively granting the Germans a gigantic unsecured loan with only vague promises that the money would eventually be paid, something which never happened. The Danish government was later able to renegotiate the Germans' arbitrary exchange rate between the German military currency and the <b>Danish</b> <b>krone</b> to reduce this problem.|$|E
2500|$|In {{regard to}} companies, the Court of Justice held in R (Daily Mail and General Trust plc) v HM Treasury that member states could {{restrict}} a company moving its seat of business, without infringing TFEU article 49. This meant the Daily Mail newspaper's parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands without first settling its tax {{bills in the}} UK. The UK {{did not need to}} justify its action, as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised. By contrast, in Centros Ltd v Erhversus-og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmark's minimum share capital rules. UK law only required £1 of capital to start a company, while Denmark's legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200,000 <b>Danish</b> <b>krone</b> (around €27,000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent. The Court of Justice held that Denmark's minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd's freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection. This approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition, and a race to the bottom in legal standards, like the US state of Delaware, which is argued to attract companies with the worst standards of accountability, and unreasonably low corporate tax. Appearing to meet the concern, in Überseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany, simply because it was not validly incorporated in Germany. Restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection, labour rights to participate in work, or the public interest in collecting taxes. But in this case denial of capacity went too far: it was an [...] "outright negation" [...] of the right of establishment. Setting a further limit, in Cartesio Oktató és Szolgáltató bt the Court of Justice held that because corporations are created by law, they must be subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose. This meant the Hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to Italy, while it still operated and was incorporated in Hungary. Thus, the court draws a distinction between the right of establishment for foreign companies (where restrictions must be justified), and the right of the state to determine conditions for companies incorporated in its territory, although it is not entirely clear why.|$|E
