2500|$|Ali {{regularly}} taunted and baited his opponents—including Liston, Frazier, and Foreman—before {{the fight}} and often during the bout itself. He said Frazier was [...] "too dumb to be champion", that he would whip Liston [...] "like <b>his</b> <b>Daddy</b> did", that Terrell was an [...] "Uncle Tom" [...] for refusing to call Ali by his name and continuing to call him Cassius Clay, and that Patterson was a [...] "rabbit". In speaking of how Ali stoked Liston's anger and overconfidence before their first fight, one writer commented that [...] "the most brilliant fight strategy in boxing history was devised by a teenager who had graduated 376 {{in a class of}} 391." ...|$|E

Almirola made a pass on Scott for 4th place. Scott controversially moved {{into the back of}} Almirola to wreck himself and Almirola. In a post-race interview, an angry Almirola retorted [...] "The 33 was obviously a dart without feathers and coming across the race track. He ran right into me. Man, he came from all the way {{at the bottom of the}} race track and ran into me. He's not even racing this series for points. He's out there having fun because <b>his</b> <b>daddy</b> gets to pay for it and he wrecked us. That's frustrating." ...|$|E

He had the best clothes and I gave him money. He didn't want for anything. Anybody in Grand Rapids can tell you that I took care of my kids".

On {{his way around the}} south, dancing and performing in whatever local dives he could, Jesco met the woman of his dreams—four foot three inch Enid Carter (Carrie Fisher). Jesco renames her Percilla. An off-beat pair, the two managed to keep all their wickedness inside the family.|$|R

2500|$|Carey's {{re-election}} campaign was an exceptionally bitter and close one. Hoffa drew {{strong support from}} Teamsters members in the Midwest and the West (with New York state a battleground), and from union leaders unhappy with Carey's anti-corruption drive and his attempt to dismantle regional and local bases of power. Hoffa attacked Carey for being a [...] "chicken" [...] and a [...] "scaredy cat", and blasted Carey's campaign literature as [...] "slimy pieces of half-truths". Carey derogatorily referred to Hoffa as [...] "Junior," [...] and denounced him as a [...] "flunky" [...] of the [...] "old guard", [...] "the same old mobbed-up, on-the-take teamster <b>his</b> <b>daddy</b> was", an [...] "imposter," [...] and all [...] "smoke and mirrors." [...] The war of words became so heated that in late September Carey filed a libel suit against Hoffa. Carey repeatedly tried to link Hoffa to organized crime, and publicized the criminal past and mob ties of Hoffa associates and business partners. Hoffa accused Carey of overseeing the loss of 40,000 members, mismanaging the union's finances, agreeing to concessionary contracts, and corruption. Carey countered by claiming he had reversed the union's membership decline, balanced the union's budget {{for the first time}} in 10 years, defeated a trucking industry proposal to use part-time temporary drivers, and rooted out corruption in the union. The election was the most expensive in Teamsters history: [...] Hoffa raised $1.3 million in contributions, while Carey raised $1.8 million and incurred $200,000 in debt.|$|E

6000|$|I see {{the evening}} at the Olympic as really itself partaking of that antiquity, even though Still Waters Run Deep, then in its flourishing {{freshness}} and as to which I remember my fine old friend Fanny Kemble's mentioning {{to me in the}} distant after-time that she had directed Tom Taylor to Charles de Bernard's novel of Un Gendre for the subject of it, passed at the moment for a highly modern [...] "social study." [...] It is perhaps in particular through the memory of our dismal approach to the theatre, the squalid slum of Wych Street, then incredibly brutal and barbarous as an avenue to joy, an avenue even sometimes for the muffled coach of Royalty, that the episode affects me as antedating some of the conditions of the mid-Victorian age; the general credit of which, I should add, was highly re-established for us by the consummately quiet and natural art, as we expertly pronounced it, of Alfred Wigan's John Mildmay and the breadth and sincerity of the representative of the rash mother-in-law whom he so imperturbably puts in her place. This was an exhibition supposed in its day to leave its spectators little to envy in the highest finish reached by the French theatre. At a remarkable height, in a different direction, moved the strange and vivid little genius of Robson, a master of fantastic intensity, unforgettable for us, we felt that night, in Planché's extravaganza of The Discreet Princess, a Christmas production preluding to the immemorial harlequinade. I still see Robson slide across the stage, in one sidelong wriggle, as the small black sinister Prince Richcraft of the fairy-tale, everything he did at once very dreadful and very droll, thoroughly true and yet none the less macabre, the great point of it all its parody of Charles Kean in The Corsican Brothers; a vision filled out a couple of years further on by <b>his</b> <b>Daddy</b> Hardacre in a two-acts version of a Parisian piece thriftily and coarsely extracted from Balzac's Eugénie Grandet. This occasion must have given the real and the finer measure of his highly original talent; so present to me, despite the interval, is the distinctiveness of his little concentrated rustic miser whose daughter helps herself from his money-box so that her cousin and lover shall save a desperate father, her paternal uncle, from bankruptcy; and the prodigious effect of Robson's appalled descent, from an upper floor, his literal headlong tumble and rattle of dismay down a steep staircase occupying the centre of the stage, on his discovery of the rifling of his chest. Long was I to have in my ears the repeated shriek of his alarm, followed by a panting babble of wonder and rage as his impetus hurled him, a prostrate scrap of despair (he was a tiny figure, yet [...] "so held the stage" [...] that in his company you could see nobody else) half way across the room. I associate a little uncertainly with the same night the sight of Charles Matthews in Sheridan's Critic and in a comedy botched from the French, like everything else in those days that was not either Sheridan or Shakespeare, called Married for Money; an example above all, this association, of the heaped measure of the old bills--vast and various enumerations as they were, of the size of but slightly reduced placards and with a strange and delightful greasy feel and redolence of printer's ink, intensely theatrical ink somehow, in their big black lettering. Charles Matthews must have been then in his mid-career, and him too, wasted and aged, infinitely [...] "marked," [...] I was to see again, ever so long after, in America; an impression reminding me, as I recover it, of how one took his talent so thoroughly for granted that he seemed somehow to get but half the credit of it: this at least in all save parts of mere farce and [...] "patter," [...] which were on a footing, and no very interesting one, of their own. The other effect, that of a naturalness so easy and immediate, so friendly and intimate, that one's relation with the artist lost itself in one's relation with the character, the artist thereby somehow positively suffering while the character gained, or at least while the spectator did--this comes back to me quite as a part even of my earlier experience and as attesting on behalf of the actor a remarkable genius; since there are no more charming artistic cases than those of the frank result, when it is frank enough, and the dissimulated process, when the dissimulation has been deep. To drop, or appear to drop, machinery and yet keep, or at least gain, intensity, the interesting intensity separated by a gulf from a mere unbought coincidence of aspect or organ, is really to do something. In spite of which, at the same time, what I perhaps most retain, {{by the light of the}} present, of the sense of that big and rather dusky night of Drury Lane is not so much the felt degree of anyone's talent as the fact that personality and artistry, with their intensity, could work their spell in such a material desert, in conditions intrinsically so charmless, so bleak and bare. The conditions gave nothing of what we regard to-day as most indispensable--since our present fine conception is but to reduce and fill in the material desert, to people and carpet and curtain it. We may be right, so far as that goes, but our predecessors were, with their eye on the essence, not wrong; thanks to which they wear the crown of our now thinking of them--if we do think of them--as in their way giants and heroes. What their successors were to become is another question; very much better dressed, beyond all doubt.|$|E

His place was fenced to keep in the hogs and cattle that were driven down on his place by what was known then as the Old Federal Road.
