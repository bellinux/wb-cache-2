25|$|The male's song {{consists}} of short pleasant warbling strophes, interspersed with fluid whistles. The individual phrases may <b>go</b> <b>like</b> tu-tu-krr-pree-pree or trr-turit trr-turit.... To announce {{that it has}} become aware of someone straying into its territory – be it a female or male of its species or a large mammal – it gives long shrill raspy whistles like trrii(u) or (t')kwiiet. To announce to females, it often mixes these whistles with a strophe of song. A softer whistle goes like trüü(t). These whistles are also used in duets between mates in winter and neighbours in the breeding season. Various contact calls have been described as chlie(p), gihrrr, kwä or wuut. These are frequently heard during courtship, interspersed with song phrases as the harsh whistles are in pre-courtship. The song becomes softer and more warbling as the male shows the female around his territory, and at potential nest sites the male gives a lively chatter containing fluting tli-tli, prrr trills and kwiw...püh calls.|$|E

At a Christmas party, a BBC executive expressed a wish for the ratings of a third series [...] "to <b>go</b> <b>like</b> Everest", indicating a steep slope with his hands. Bathurst replied, [...] "But, Everest goes down the other side..." [...] The show was not recommissioned. Moffat says {{that he had no}} idea for a third series anyway, as it would have been difficult to contrive how {{a group of people who}} did not particularly like each other would get together so regularly.|$|E
500|$|The {{trial was}} held {{behind closed doors}} and the public was not {{informed}} of the results nor that legal proceedings had occurred until a few days later. Despite the outcome, when the matter was made public, it was accompanied with a warning from Khánh against neutralism. The public press release stated that Khánh's junta had taken a lenient approach to enhance [...] "the spirit of unity and the traditional comradeship in arms of the armed forces." [...] Some civilians in Khánh's cabinet were caught off-guard by the secret hearing and one spoke out, saying [...] "Letting them <b>go</b> <b>like</b> this removes the apparent justification for the whole Government's existence". The junta statement did not specifically charge anyone of neutralism but said that repetition of such activities could result in discharges from the military, implying that neutralist moves had occurred in the past. It warned of [...] "infliction of all the punishments reserved for military personnel who have committed the crime of treason against {{the people in the}} struggled against the Communists and neutralists." ...|$|E

500|$|Little Mix co-wrote [...] "DNA" [...] with TMS and Iain James. TMS {{developed}} the song's guitar riff, drum beats and synths. It received additional vocal engineering from Daniel Aslet and Ben Collier. Serban Ghenea mixed the track at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, USA, and Tom Coyne {{was responsible for}} the song's mastering. [...] "DNA" [...] was based on the emotions a girl develops when she first meets and dates a boy. In an interview with Emily Laurence of Seventeen, Perrie Edwards explained: [...] "When a girl first gets with a boy, that kind of romance makes you feel really giddy and happy. That's what 'DNA' is about." [...] The group wrote [...] "DNA" [...] as a unique love song by coming up with scientific ideas that would match with love. It was also written as a song about obsession. Speaking to Tim Jonze of The Guardian, Leigh-Anne Pinnock mentioned: [...] "It's not just a love song, it's about being obsessed with someone to the extreme. And sometimes when things go bad you do <b>go</b> <b>like</b> that, you stalk them on Facebook..." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Manley {{described}} Roach as [...] "swashbuckling", playing risky but attractive shots outside off stump. He {{could play}} with equal ability {{from either the}} front foot—with his weight going forward into a batting shot—or back foot. George John, his former coach, believed {{that he was more}} effective on the back foot, and sometimes failed to move his feet when batting, but that his ability to deflect the ball by the movements of his wrist was unsurpassed in the whole world. John also suggested that Roach might struggle to play one delivery but then hit the next for six. The writer C. L. R. James described how he attacked the short ball outside off stump: [...] " [...] his right foot back and across as far as it will go, and then let him lift his bat as high as he possibly can and from that position let it <b>go</b> <b>like</b> a piston at the unfortunate ball." [...] The resulting stroke left little chance for the fielders." [...] From this description, the journalist Frank Keating suggested a playing resemblance to Gordon Greenidge. On another occasion, James described Roach as [...] "an untalkative but cheerful soul." [...] Roach's form may have been affected by his lack of a regular partner to open the batting; he frequently had different partners from one Test to the next. He was a very effective fielder, especially in the covers.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the struggles}} with the strike, co-executive producer/staff writer Adam Horowitz recounted this as [...] "a {{satisfying}} episode to work on—it was like we'd been waiting so long {{to tell the story}} of what happened with Michael." [...] Carlton Cuse stated that [...] "we [...] felt that the audience deserved to know, you know, once he and Walt sailed off in the boat, what was their journey." [...] Supervising producer/writer Elizabeth Sarnoff stated that [...] "Michael's goal—the whole season—is to die and he gets an opportunity to redeem himself when [...] finds him." [...] Co-executive producer/staff writer Edward Kitsis added that [...] "It's heartbreaking when Walt wouldn't see [...] … I always respected the fact that he told his son about the murders … Even though he knew it would probably blow up their relationship, he wanted to be honest with his son. In a way, you've got to respect that." [...] Harold Perrineau, who plays Michael, concluded that [...] "He's done some bad things and he's you know, got himself into a messy situation, but at the end of the day, Michael's a good guy." [...] Instead of being intercut with scenes from the main ongoing plot, the flashbacks of [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] are presented continuously and are only bookended by present-day scenes. This is the second episode to do this after [...] "Flashes Before Your Eyes" [...] from the third season. The flashback portion of [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson" [...] is the longest in Lost history; Horowitz stated that [...] "As we were breaking the story, it just happened, and it turned into the longest flashback to date." [...] When asked why Michael's alias was not an allusion to a literary or historical figure, as with other Lost characters, Damon Lindelof explained that [...] "if the Others … had chosen … Darwin or … Dickens, then … Widmore would have gotten suspicious: he'd <b>go</b> <b>like,</b> 'oh, now there's somebody on my boat with a literary allusion in their name, which sounds very much like that's a Benjamin Linus alias', so they picked the most innocuous name they possibly could, which was Kevin Johnson." [...] Lindelof also said that it was a coincidence that [...] "Kevin Johnson" [...] was also the name of an American basketball player.|$|E

Alvin Beam reviewed it for the Cleveland Plain Dealer, writing, [...] "Editors, like novelists, have brain children—books they think up and bring to life without putting their own names on the title page.

2500|$|This is the {{simplest}} {{use of the}} toleta de marteloio. [...] It is, at root, a trigonometric table. However, it does not tackle the traverse problem in one <b>go,</b> <b>like</b> the Law of Sines, but rather splits the problem into two right-angled triangles which it proceeds to solve successively. [...] Modern trigonometry would dispense with the step of calculating the alargar, and calculate the ritorno directly – but for that, one needs to be armed with a full sine table. The toleta is a rather simple table, easy to consult and perform calculations with, and sufficiently compact to be memorized by navigators (as Bianco recommends).|$|E
2500|$|Like all elapid snakes, coral snakes {{possess a}} pair of small hollow fangs to deliver their venom. The fangs are {{positioned}} {{at the front of}} the mouth. [...] The fangs are fixed in position rather than retractable, and rather than being directly connected to the venom duct, they have a small groove through which the venom enters the base of the fangs. Because the fangs are relatively small and inefficient for venom delivery, rather than biting quickly and letting <b>go</b> (<b>like</b> vipers), coral snakes tend to hold onto their prey and make chewing motions when biting. The venom takes time to take full effect.|$|E

2500|$|It was Mario Bauzá who {{introduced}} bebop innovator Dizzy Gillespie to the Cuban conga drummer and composer Chano Pozo. Gillespie and Pozo's brief collaboration produced {{some of the}} most enduring Afro-Cuban jazz standards. [...] "Manteca" [...] (1947) is the first jazz standard to be rhythmically based on clave. According to Gillespie, Pozo composed the layered, contrapuntal guajeos (Afro-Cuban ostinatos) of the A section and the introduction, while Gillespie wrote the bridge. Gillespie recounted: [...] "If I'd let it <b>go</b> <b>like</b> [...] wanted it, it would have been strictly Afro-Cuban all the way. There wouldn't have been a bridge. I thought I was writing an eight-bar bridge, but ... I had to keep going and ended up writing a sixteen-bar bridge." [...] The bridge gave [...] "Manteca" [...] a typical jazz harmonic structure, setting the piece apart from Bauza's modal [...] "Tanga" [...] of a few years earlier.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} was still experiencing extensive teething troubles {{as well as}} being victimized by [...] "urban legends", mostly involving inapplicable twin engine factors which had been designed out of the aircraft by Lockheed. In addition to these, the early versions had a reputation as a [...] "widow maker" [...] as it could enter an unrecoverable dive due to a sonic surface effect at high sub-sonic speeds. [...] The 527 P-38Fs were heavier, with more powerful engines that used more fuel, and were unpopular in the air war in Northern Europe. Since the heavier engines were having reliability problems and with them, without external fuel tanks, the range of the P-38F was reduced, and since drop tanks themselves were in short supply as the fortunes in the Battle of the Atlantic had not yet swung the Allies' way, the aircraft became relatively unpopular in minds of the bomber command planning staffs despite being the longest ranged fighter first available to the 8th Air Force in sufficient numbers for long range escort duties. Nonetheless, General Spaatz, then commander of the 8th Air Force in the UK, said of the P-38F: [...] "I'd rather have an airplane that goes like hell and has a few things wrong with it, than one that won't <b>go</b> <b>like</b> hell and has a few things wrong with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The title character, Beowulf, {{is portrayed}} by Ray Winstone. Zemeckis cast Winstone after seeing his {{performance}} as the title character of the 2003 ITV serial Henry VIII. On {{the topic of the}} original poem, Winstone commented during an interview, [...] "I had the beauty of not reading the book, which I understand portrays Beowulf as a very one-dimensional kind of character; a hero and a warrior and that was it. I didn't have any of that baggage to bring with me." [...] Winstone enjoyed working with motion capture, stating that [...] "You were allowed to <b>go,</b> <b>like</b> theater, where you carry a scene on and you become engrossed within the scene. I loved the speed of it. There was no time to sit around. You actually cracked on with a scene and your energy levels were kept up. There was no time to actually sit around and lose your concentration. So, for me, I actually really, really enjoyed this experience." [...] Unlike some of his castmates, Winstone's animated counterpart bears little resemblance to the actor who was in his early 50s when he filmed the role; Winstone noted that his computer-generated counterpart resembled himself at the age of eighteen, although the filmmakers did not have a photo for reference. Winstone also played a dwarf performer, and the [...] "Golden Man"/Dragon.|$|E
