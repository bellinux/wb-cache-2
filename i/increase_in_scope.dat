60|$|All {{over the}} country small British columns had been {{operating}} during these months--operations which were destined to <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>scope</b> and energy as the cold weather drew in. The weekly tale of prisoners and captures, though small for any one column, gave the aggregate result of a considerable victory. In these scattered and obscure actions there was much good work which can have no reward save the knowledge of duty done. Among many successful raids and skirmishes may be mentioned two by Colonel Park from Lydenburg, which resulted between them in the capture of nearly 100 of the enemy, including Abel Erasmus of sinister reputation. Nor would any summary of these events be complete without {{a reference to the}} very gallant defence of Mahlabatini in Zululand, which was successfully held by a handful of police and civilians against an irruption of the Boers. With the advent of winter and of reinforcements the British operations became very energetic in every part of the country, and some account of them will now be added.|$|E

In 2003, the province announced plans for a 17 km east Deerfoot Trail. The original design was limited in scope and incorporated two interchanges, one flyover and two signallized intersections with completion scheduled in 2007 at a cost of $250 million.
