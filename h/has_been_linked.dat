5|$|Neuroblastoma <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to copy-number {{variation}} {{within the}} NBPF10 gene, {{which results in}} the 1q21.1 deletion syndrome or 1q21.1 duplication syndrome.|$|E

50|$|Omptins <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> with {{pathogenesis}} {{in several}} bacteria.|$|R
5|$|Thrombophilia <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to {{recurrent}} miscarriage, {{and possibly}} various complications of pregnancy such as intrauterine growth restriction, stillbirth, severe pre-eclampsia and abruptio placentae.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its role}} in {{generating}} the activated form of NF-κB, an anti-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory regulator of cytokine expression, proteasomal activity <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Increased levels of proteasome activity correlate with disease activity and have been implicated in autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
5|$|In humans, the 561 {{amino acid}} EFS protein {{acts as a}} {{scaffolding}} protein for cell signaling based on interactions with SRC, FAK, and other proteins, and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to roles in {{the function of the}} immune system, and the development of cancer.|$|E

5|$|Lead {{exposure}} {{in young children}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to learning disabilities, and children with blood lead concentrations greater than 10μg/dL {{are in danger of}} developmental disabilities. Increased blood lead level in children has been correlated with decreases in intelligence, nonverbal reasoning, short-term memory, attention, reading and arithmetic ability, fine motor skills, emotional regulation, and social engagement.|$|E
5|$|Other {{species that}} are less {{commonly}} affected include cats and horses, {{as well as other}} large domestic animals. In cats, hypothyroidism is usually the result of other medical treatment such as surgery or radiation. In young horses, congenital hypothyroidism has been reported predominantly in Western Canada and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> with the mother's diet.|$|E
5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} {{presents itself}} {{in a variety of}} ways, with especially high contrast existing between the presentation of the typical adult sufferer without a mental disability and the presentation of an infant and/or mentally impaired sufferer. Like related gastrointestinal disorders, rumination can adversely affect normal functioning and the social lives of individuals. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> with depression.|$|E

5|$|Trivalent {{chromium}} {{occurs in}} trace amounts in foods, wine and water. In contrast, hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI) or Cr6+) is highly toxic and mutagenic when inhaled. Ingestion of chromium(VI) in water <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to stomach tumors, {{and it may}} also cause allergic contact dermatitis (ACD).|$|E
5|$|A steepening of the {{subduction}} zone during the Late Miocene <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> {{to an increase}} in volcanic activity and its westward migration, but {{it is unlikely that the}} pattern of activity in the southern Puna next to the Toro fault zone can be explained through this alone. A large low velocity and low seismic attenuation anomaly is found between 20 and 24° latitude south. Some geologic evidence, including geochemistry and geographic indicators, imply that lithospheric detachment did occur beneath the southern Puna.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler's {{sexuality}} {{has long}} been a matter of historical and scholarly debate. There is evidence that he had romantic encounters with a number of women during his lifetime, as well as evidence of his antipathy to homosexuality, and no evidence of homosexual encounters. His name <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to a number of possible female lovers, two of whom committed suicide. Another died of complications eight years after a suicide attempt, and one made a failed suicide attempt.|$|E

5|$|An {{outbreak}} of a gastrointestinal illness in Spain which was causing mortalities in humans <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to western jackdaws. During a post-mortem on an affected bird, a polyomavirus was {{isolated from the}} spleen. The illness {{appeared to be a}} co-infection of this with Salmonella and the virus has been provisionally named the crow polyomavirus (CPyV). Segmented filamentous bacteria have been isolated from the small intestine of a western jackdaw, although their pathogenicity or role is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue is}} the role of {{inherited}} genetic factors in shaping attachments: for example one type of polymorphism of the gene coding for the D2 dopamine receptor <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to anxious attachment and another in the gene for the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor with avoidant attachment. This suggests that the influence of maternal care on attachment security is not the same for all children. One theoretical basis for this is that it makes biological sense for children to vary in their susceptibility to rearing influence.|$|E
5|$|At {{the very}} end of the Preclassic Period, around 100–300 AD, cities in the {{highlands}} and along the Pacific Coast ceased to raise sculpted stelae bearing hieroglyphic texts. This cessation in the production of stelae was the most dramatic symptom of a general decline in the region at this time. This decline <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to the intrusion of peoples from the western highlands combined with the disastrous eruption of the Ilopango Volcano that severely affected the entire region.|$|E

5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} {{studied by}} Bottlenose Dolphin Research Institute researchers {{off the island}} of Sardinia show random social behavior while feeding, and their social behavior {{does not depend on}} feeding activity. In Sardinia, the presence of a floating marine fin-fish farm <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to a change in bottlenose dolphin distribution as a result of high fish density around the floating cages in the farming area.|$|E
5|$|Bulk cargo {{can be very}} dense, corrosive, or abrasive. This {{can present}} safety problems: cargo shifting, {{spontaneous}} combustion, and cargo saturation can threaten a ship. The use of ships that are old and have corrosion problems <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to a spate of bulker sinkings in the 1990s, as have the bulker's large hatchways, important for efficient cargo handling. New international regulations have since been introduced to improve ship design and inspection, and to streamline the process of abandoning ship.|$|E
5|$|Great mullein most {{frequently}} grows as a colonist of bare and disturbed soil, usually on sandy or chalky ones. It grows best in dry, sandy or gravelly soils, {{although it can}} grow {{in a variety of}} habitats, including banksides, meadows, roadsides, forest clearings and pastures. This ability to grow {{in a wide range of}} habitats <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>linked</b> to strong phenotype variation rather than adaptation capacities.|$|E
