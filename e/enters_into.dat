40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{illustrate}} the character of the construction firm <b>entering</b> <b>into</b> agriculture sector and to consider the condition for the continuance of agricultural business. The results are summarized as follows: 1) Construction firm <b>entering</b> <b>into</b> agriculture sector are regional ones and they <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> agriculture sector in order to maintain their employment. 2) To continue agricultural business, it is important to fill the information gap by building relation with organ concerned. 3) Some construction firm build relation with organ concerned without official support. It is highly significant from the perspective of maintaining the regional economic vitality that regional construction firm <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> agriculture sector. Because some construction firm yield the local products in response to regional request, construction firm <b>entering</b> <b>into</b> agriculture sector have a potential to be bearer of regional agriculture. It is needed that local government re-evaluate construction firm <b>entering</b> <b>into</b> agriculture sector from the perspective of maintaining the regional economic vitality and creating bearer of regional agriculture, and support them if needed. After this, it is needed to verify hypothesis that construction firm <b>entering</b> <b>into</b> agriculture sector maintain the regional economic vitality and regional agriculture.

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2015. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The {{shortage}} of nurse educators {{has an effect}} on the training of current and future nurses. A {{shortage of}} nurse educators leads to the inability {{to increase the number of}} student nurses, which results in a lack of trained nursing staff to meet the healthcare needs of the South African population. There is a need to gain an understanding of why nurse educators <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> and remain in academia versus the reasons why nurse practitioners – specifically registered nurses (RN) – choose to <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> and remain in practice. The prioritised reasons for <b>entering</b> <b>into</b> and remaining in nurse academia were investigated with a focus on: i.) The difference between the reasons why RNs <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> and remain in nursing practice ii.) The difference between the reasons why nurse educators <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> and remain in academia iii.) The difference between the reasons why RNs <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> nursing practice and reasons for nurse educators <b>entering</b> <b>into</b> academia iv.) The difference between the reasons why RNs remain in nursing practice and reasons why nurse educators remain in academia A descriptive, quantitative design was used to explore the factors that lead to nurses <b>entering</b> <b>into</b> and remaining in academia. An on-line, self-administered survey was used as the primary data collection instrument. Data was tabulated and presented in histograms and frequencies. The study found that: i.) RNs <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> and remain in nursing practice for the same reasons ii.) That nurse educators <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> and remain in academia for different reasons iii.) That RNs <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> nursing practice and nurse educators <b>enter</b> <b>into</b> academia for different reasons iv.) The primary reason for RNs remaining in nursing practice and nurse educators remaining in academia are the same The shortage of nurse educators is critical and it is essential that NEIs begin to institute plans focussing on the reasons behind nurse educators’ decision to stay in nursing education. Private NEIs should use the findings of this study to focus on areas that indicate satisfaction with the position rather than dissatisfaction in order to develop specific attraction and retention strategies...|$|R

With Raynor and Mengsk, Fenix <b>enters</b> <b>into</b> an alliance with Sarah Kerrigan against the UED, even leading the Zerg forces on a raiding mission for resources on Moria.

Though unfazed by Kerrigan's betrayal, Fenix is slain when Kerrigan's Zerg launch a surprise attack against his base camp on Korhal. In StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm, Raynor shows that he still harbors a grudge against Kerrigan for Fenix's death after seeing her willingly become infested again after all his hard work in returning her to human form.|$|E
5|$|Pure carbon has {{extremely}} low toxicity to humans {{and can be}} handled and even ingested safely {{in the form of}} graphite or charcoal. It is resistant to dissolution or chemical attack, even in the acidic contents of the digestive tract. Consequently, once it <b>enters</b> <b>into</b> the body's tissues it is likely to remain there indefinitely. Carbon black {{was probably one of the}} first pigments to be used for tattooing, and Ötzi the Iceman was found to have carbon tattoos that survived during his life and for 5200years after his death. Inhalation of coal dust or soot (carbon black) in large quantities can be dangerous, irritating lung tissues and causing the congestive lung disease, coalworker's pneumoconiosis. Diamond dust used as an abrasive can be harmful if ingested or inhaled. Microparticles of carbon are produced in diesel engine exhaust fumes, and may accumulate in the lungs. In these examples, the harm may result from contaminants (e.g., organic chemicals, heavy metals) rather than from the carbon itself.|$|E
