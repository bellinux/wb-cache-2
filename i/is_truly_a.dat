Lu Bu then defeats the Coalition at Hu Lao Gate, but they are not done for yet. Also, he finds that Dong Zhuo <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> <b>a</b> monster, and starts a revolt in Wan Castle and cuts him down. Now in charge of Dong Zhuo's army, he defeats Cao Cao, Liu Bei, and Sun Jian in several campaigns, and takes over the land.|$|E

25|$|In Season 2, Aquaman is now {{partners}} with Lagoon Boy, and is crushed upon discovering that Kaldur'am has been corrupted and {{joined forces with}} his father Black Manta. Kaldur'am claims he could not trust Aquaman as he had kept the identity of Black Manta a secret from Kaldur'am. Aquaman states {{that it was a}} mistake, and tries to convince him that no one need suffer for it, but Aqualad angrily attacks his teacher. It is later revealed that Aqualad's corruption <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> <b>a</b> facade created so that he may infiltrate the supercriminal organization, the Light.|$|E

25|$|That Susan was Kane's {{wife and}} Marion was Hearst's {{mistress}} {{is a difference}} more important than might be guessed in today's changed climate of opinion. The wife was a puppet and a prisoner; the mistress was never less than a princess. Hearst built more than one castle, and Marion was the hostess in all of them: they were pleasure domes indeed, and the Beautiful People of the day fought for invitations. Xanadu was a lonely fortress, and Susan was quite right to escape from it. The mistress was never one of Hearst's possessions: he was always her suitor, {{and she was the}} precious treasure of his heart for more than 30 years, until his last breath of life. Theirs <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> <b>a</b> love story. Love is not the subject of Citizen Kane.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, we {{are forced}} to testify that Bourguiba's Tunisia could no more be called secular than Ben Ali's or the rest of the Arab Muslim states, for more than a {{neutrality}} of orientation and the religious freedom of the state, secularism implies the autonomy of public and religious institutions. The reality is that the institutional presence of Islam in Tunisia, although strictly circumscribed, <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> <b>a</b> constant reference, implicit or explicit, legitimizing the regime's direction. Certainly, Tunisian public services are accessible to all without distinction of creed and the constitution guarantees religious freedom, so long as it does not threaten public order, but Islam remains the state religion, {{to the extent that it}} is said it is obligatory for the president of the republic to be able to assert it.|$|E
25|$|Oba captures Kahlan and {{is ordered}} by the Keeper to take her, along with the Sword of Truth, to the Pillars of Creation. Using his link to the sword, Richard pursues Oba to the Pillars, where he {{encounters}} Jennsen, who has also been drawn to the same spot by the Keeper in order to kill Richard. The Keeper's supreme plan, however, was for Richard to kill Jennsen at the Pillars of Creation and thereby open a gate between the Keeper's realm {{and the world of}} the living. Richard discerns the plan and refuses to be goaded into cooperating. Jennsen recognizes his integrity and the Keeper's plan is foiled. She learns that the men who were sent to kill her mother were actually soldiers of the Imperial Order, and after coming to believe that Richard <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> <b>a</b> loving and caring brother, she joins him and Kahlan in their quest against Jagang.|$|E

25|$|For instance, palladium(II) acetate {{is reduced}} by {{triphenylphosphine}} to bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (1) and triphenylphosphine is oxidized to triphenylphosphine oxide. Step A is an oxidative addition in which palladium inserts itself in the aryl to bromide bond. Palladium then forms a π complex with the alkene (3) and in step B the alkene inserts itself in the palladium - carbon bond in a syn addition step. Then follows a torsional strain relieving rotation to the trans isomer (not shown) and step C is a beta-hydride elimination step {{with the formation of}} a new palladium - alkene π complex (5). This complex is destroyed in the next step. The palladium(0) compound is regenerated by reductive elimination of the palladium(II) compound by potassium carbonate in the final step, D. In the course of the reaction the carbonate is stoichiometrically consumed and palladium <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> <b>a</b> catalyst and used in catalytic amounts. A similar palladium cycle but with different scenes and actors is observed in the Wacker process.|$|E
25|$|While {{traveling}} through Styria, Behmen and Felson encounter the grotesque sight of people {{infected with the}} Black Death and discover that the Holy Roman Empire has been swept by the plague. They enter an unnamed town, trying to conceal their identity as deserters, but are revealed as knights by the crest on Behmen's sword. They are arrested and taken to Cardinal D'Ambroise, who is infected with the plague. The Cardinal asks the knights to escort an alleged witch suspected of causing the plague to a remote monastery, where an elite group of monks reside. These monks can determine if the girl <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> <b>a</b> witch, and if she is found guilty, know a sacred ritual to cancel her powers and stop the plague that is devastating Europe. The two knights agree under the condition she be given a fair trial and that the charges of desertion against them be dropped. The Cardinal agrees and they set out accompanied by a priest, Debelzaq; a young altar boy, Kay von Wollenbarth, who {{wants to become a}} knight like his deceased father; a knight, Johann Eckhardt, whose family was killed by the plague; and the well-traveled swindler Hagamar, who will serve as their guide to the monastery in return for a pardon. The witch, a young girl later identified as Anna from Marburg, shows hatred towards Debelzaq and forms a bond with Behmen.|$|E

500|$|Dear M. Rousseau, Bordeaux–Paris is {{approaching}} and this great annual event which {{has done so}} much to promote cycling has given us an idea. What would {{you think of a}} training race which preceded Bordeaux–Paris by four weeks? The distance between Paris and Roubaix is roughly 280km, so it would be child's play for the future participants of Bordeaux–Paris. The finish would take place at the Roubaix vélodrome after several laps of the track. Everyone would be assured of an enthusiastic welcome as most of our citizens have never had the privilege of seeing the spectacle of a major road race and we count on enough friends to believe that Roubaix <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> <b>a</b> hospitable town. As prizes we already have subscribed to a first prize of 1,000 francs {{in the name of the}} Roubaix velodrome and we will be busy establishing a generous prize list which will be to the satisfaction of all. But for the moment, can we count on the patronage of Le Vélo and on your support for organising the start? ...|$|E

Author Thomas S. Hischak called it [...] "plaintive". Billboards Geoff Burpee [...] called it [...] "A sterling, intimate moment from the Evita soundtrack. Yes kids, she [...] can sing". Writing for Los Angeles Times, David Gritten opined Madonna's voice sounded [...] "pitch-perfect and clear as a bell". Greg Morago, from the Hartford Courant, felt that [...] "By giving her 'Another Suitcase' with its heartbreaking 'Where am I going to?' refrain, Madonna adds a necessary, fragile vulnerability to her ambitious, rags- to-riches Eva Peron". Neil Strauss from The Herald Journal, said that [...] "Madonna radiates on 'Another Suitcase in Another Hall'".

Writing for The Huffington Post, Matthew Jacobs gave the song a more negative review; [...] "it could be credited as a curtsy to Madonna's impending Evita/Ray of Light comeback. Unfortunately, it also sounds like a dull displacement from a compilation of yearning '80s ballads". Nevertheless, he placed [...] "You'll See" [...] at number 69 of his list [...] "The Definitive Ranking Of Madonna Singles".
