40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigates the}} effects of {{machining}} parameters on the surface integrity of <b>hard</b> <b>machined</b> surfaces. The residual stress distribution of <b>hard</b> <b>machined</b> surfaces is characterized by compressive stresses in the range between 150 and 1000 MPa. Typically, residual stresses in the feed direction are more compressive above a depth of 12. 7 mm, while residual stresses in the cutting direction are more compressive below a depth of 12. 7 mm. The micro-hardness distribution of <b>hard</b> <b>machined</b> surfaces {{is characterized by a}} lower surface hardness and a stable bulk hardness. It is noted that a higher cutting speed induces a more softened layer. The machining-induced residual stress and micro-hardness distribution can increase the crack initiation life by 39 per cent, while increasing the crack propagation life by more than four times. Accordingly, it can increase the fatigue life by more than three times. The results are presented that demonstrate that the machining parameters significantly influence the residual stress and micro-hardness distribution of <b>hard</b> <b>machined</b> surfaces and that the fatigue performance of <b>hard</b> <b>machined</b> surfaces can be significantly enhanced by optimizing the machining parameters...|$|R

An experimental program was carried out to determine the cutting forces, chip formation, the secondary deformation zone thickness and surface roughness at different cutting speeds using a 0. 4 mm and 0. 8 mm nose radii ceramic tools and - 7 ° rake angle for annealed (virgin) AISI 4140 and heat treated AISI 4140 steel. Another series of experiments was carried out on the annealed (virgin) and heat treated AISI D 2 with 0. 4 mm, 0. 8 mm and 1. 2 mm nose radii CBN (Cubic Boron Nitride) tools under various cutting conditions. A theoretical model is developed by {{taking into account the}} flow stress properties of the AISI 4140 (0. 44 % carbon content) to use with the Oxley Machining approach. To find the flow stress data for AISI D 2 tool steel, the Johnson and Cook empirical constitutive equation is used as the constitutive model.

40|$|A {{new concept}} of using single-step dry {{machining}} of hardened steels {{has been proposed}} at Purdue as a finish process to replace grinding and other finish processes. This concept has been proven to be feasible and disclosed in US Patent 5878496 [Liu and Mittal, 1999). The objective {{of this research is}} to develop the capability to predict the thermal damage beneath hard machined surfaces so that optimal machining conditions can be obtained. This research is divided into two major parts. ^ In the first part, the thermal damage models of the workpiece material are constructed, through heat treatment experiment, for the two damage types, namely, re-tempering and re-quenching, in hard machined surfaces. The re-tempering model describes the material hardness change as a function of material thermal history, while the re-quenching model expresses the hardness based on material peak temperature. Since both thermal damage and work hardening effects exist in hard machined surfaces, and influence hardness distribution, a decoupling method is developed to separate and study the two effects individually. It is found that work hardening effect is negligible when a relatively sharp tool is used in <b>hard</b> <b>machining.</b> ^ In the second part, a finite element (FE) model is constructed to simulate <b>hard</b> <b>machining</b> process to obtain cutting temperature. The modeling effort focuses on obtaining the real flow stress properties at elevated temperatures, through applying the developed tempering model to eliminate tempering effect in experimentally obtained strain-stress data. Meanwhile, the effort also involves the development of sub-models on the friction, heat generation, heat conduction, and annealing effect. Orthogonal machining of hardened AISI 52100 steel is simulated by the proposed FE model, and verified by experiment on cutting forces, chip morphologies, and the formation of white layer in chips. Next, the FE model is applied to simulate realistic 3 D <b>hard</b> <b>machining,</b> and material thermal histories are obtained and fed into the thermal damage models. Subsequently, the distributions of thermal damage beneath machined surfaces are predicted. Excellent agreement is found between the prediction and the experiment. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{machining}} of {{high performance}} workpiece materials requires significantly harder cutting materials. In <b>hard</b> <b>machining,</b> the early tool wear occurs {{due to high}} process forces and temperatures. The hardest known material is the diamond, but steel materials cannot be machined with diamond tools because of the reactivity of iron with carbon. Cubic boron nitride (cBN) is the second hardest of all known materials. The supply of such PcBN indexable inserts, which are only geometrically simple and available, requires several work procedures and is cost-intensive. The development of a cBN coating for cutting tools, combine the advantages of a thin film system and of cBN. Flexible cemented carbide tools, in respect to the geometry can be coated. The cBN films with a thickness of up to 2 µm on cemented carbide substrates show excellent mechanical and physical properties. This paper describes {{the results of the}} machining of various workpiece materials in turning and milling operations regarding the tool life, resultant cutting force components and workpiece surface roughness.

40|$|When <b>hard</b> <b>machining</b> {{is used as}} a {{finishing}} process, {{the surface}} quality of the work produced is critical. One of the obstacles that keeps <b>hard</b> <b>machining</b> from widespread use is thermal damage, in the form of microstructural change, in the machined surface layer. Research in the past concerning the thermally damaged layer only relates to qualitative observations and descriptions for a few special cases, which can not provide the knowledge needed for understanding the physics of heat transfer regarding the formation of thermal damage and its relationship to the cutting conditions. ^ A new methodology for analyzing the heat transfer in finish <b>hard</b> <b>machining</b> is developed in this research. The methodology consists of a mathematical thermal model based on Green 2 ̆ 7 s function with a microstructure-based experimental method using orthogonal hard turning. The thermal model derived describes the heat transfer of a worn tool, with heat sources at the tool-chip interface (due to chip formation) and the tool-work interface (due to flank wear). The coupling of interface boundary conditions due to chip formation and flank wear is resolved using the proposed microstructure-based method, which is a departure from the conventionally incorrect approaches based on the assumption of constant chip formation. By utilizing the microstructural change, shown as white layers, in chips the heat entering into the chip and the work can be obtained simultaneously and therefore decoupled. By incorporating the microstructure-based method with the thermal model, the heat partition equations are solved and the temperatures, heat generated, heat partition, and the shear forces at the tool-chip and tool-work interfaces can be determined quantitatively. ^ The results explain how an increase of flank wear, feedrate, and the rake angle towards negative facilitate the formation of the white layer. It is also shown that ceramic tools are prone to white layer formation as compared to CBN tools. In addition, the effect of flank wear on the cutting mechanics is revealed by decomposing the cutting force measurement with known interface shear forces. It is shown that the forces needed for chip formation are not constant and are reduced as the tool flank is progressively worn. The proposed methodology has the advantage of analyzing the heat transfer and the cutting mechanics of <b>hard</b> <b>machining</b> without involving: (1) the modeling of the complex mechanism of saw-toothed chip formation that is still not well understood, and (2) the interface temperature measurement that is extremely difficult to perform. ^ The effect of cutting conditions, including cryogenic cooling, on the white layer formation in three dimensional hard turning is also studied experimentally. A statistical model that relates the thickness of the white layer and the cutting variables is established. The effect of each cutting variable on the formation of the white layer is evaluated using a relative importance index derived from the statistical model. It is found that the heat transfer analysis agrees with the result of the three dimensional experiment. Furthermore, the analysis serves as a strong base for studying the effect of cutting variables on the heat transfer, thus the thermal damage, which greatly helps the explanation on what is observed in three dimensional cutting. ...|$|E
