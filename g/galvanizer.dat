40|$|The 2013 Steubenville, Ohio, {{rape case}} {{featured}} a sadly familiar story of juvenile acquaintance rape involving star football players; what captured national {{interest in the}} case, however, was how the rapists and peer witnesses alike captured video and photos of the sexual assault and disseminated them swiftly and publicly via social media sites. This qualitative textual analysis utilizes framing theory to explore how national news coverage framed new media technology {{in relation to the}} Steubenville rape case, particularly how technology was framed as witness, <b>galvanizer,</b> and threat during the rape and its aftermath. Implications of these frames, as well as a lack of broader sexual assault context in the media coverage, are considered...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{part of a}} study {{aimed at}} ﬁnding a suitable, yet cost-effective, surface ﬁnish for a steel structure subject to the car washing environment and corrosive chemicals. The initial, life cycle and average equivalent annual (AEAC) costs for surface ﬁnishing methods were calculated for a steel structure using the LCCC algorithm developed by American <b>Galvanizers</b> Association (AGA). The cost study consisted of 45 common surface ﬁnish systems including: hot-dip galvanization (HDG), metallization, acrylic, alkyd and epoxy as well as duplex coatings such as epoxy zinc and inorganic zinc (IOZ). The results show that initial, life cycle and AEAC costs for hot dip galvanization are the lowest among all the other methods, followed by coal tar epoxy painting. The annual average cost of HDG for this structure was estimated about € 0. 22 /m 2, while the other cost-effective alternatives were: IOZ, polyurea, epoxy waterborne and IOZ/epoxy duplex coating.

40|$|The {{results of}} studies on several aspects of {{poisoning}} caused by lead. mercury, manganese, hard metal, nickel, and uranium are reviewed. Studies on lead comprise the development of methods for the determination of lead in biological material, the analysis of pathophysiological processes and clinical manifestations of saturnism, and the elaboration of criteria {{for the assessment of}} working capacity in intoxicated workers. Investigations concerning mercury poisoning include the determination of methods for the determination of mercury in biological material, observations on the pathophysiological and clinical manifestations of mercurialism, and the drawing up of criteria for the assessment of fitness for work in intoxicated workers. In connection with the occurrence of manganism in the production of manganese alloys in Šibenik, studies were conducted on the clinical picture of manganism, technological processes in which the workers were exposed to manganese smoke and dust, and the measures to be undertaken to prevent manganism. Results are presented of the follow up of a group of workers exposed to hard metal dust and the pathogenesis of pneumoconiosis caused by hard metal. Work is reviewed on nickel allergy observed in <b>galvanizers</b> in various industrial establishments. The review also includes results of observations on the harmful effect of uranium; in this connection polarographic methods have been developed for the determination of small amounts of this metal in the blood, urine and kidneys...|$|R

40|$|The {{galvanizing}} {{reaction is}} {{very sensitive to}} alloying elements of steel. Therefore when industrial processes are considered the method is trying to counterbalance the influence of alloying elements in the steel by adding Al, Ni, Mn in the zinc bath. Although Si is often considered by steelmakers as necessary for killing and improving the mechanical properties of steel, it is usually undesirable by <b>galvanizers</b> because the reactivity of steel with zinc dramatically changes with % Si. This phenomenon is best illustrated by {{the thickness of the}} coating versus % Si which presents a sharp maximum near 0. 08 % Si and a minimum near 0. 20 % Si. This phenomenon discovered by Sandelin (1941) has not yet received any uncontroversial interpretation. In the present studies, we compared the morphologies and kinetics obtained in the same conditions for different silicon contents and we specially considered the coating obtained for small times of immersion. It is shown that in all cases, the first intermetallic phase which appears is [MATH]. The experimental analysis of the compounds as well as thermodynamical calculations prove that the solubility of Si in [MATH] is negligible but of about 1 at. % in [MATH]. Moreover, thermodynamical evaluation of Gibbs free energy of Fe-Zn liquid shows that, if zinc diffusion in substrate is negligible, [MATH] is in a metastable equilibrium at 450 °C with the liquid containing about 7 % Fe, which corresponds to the [MATH] compound. Our modelling shows that for Sandelin steels, the fist stage of the reaction is not driven by diffusion of Fe in solid phases but in the liquid, leading to a linear variation of the reaction with time t. In a second stage the kinetics obeys a [MATH] law and corresponds to the solid state diffusion observed for hypo-Sandelin steel. The diffusion paths across liquid domains introduce supplementary degrees of freedom in the morphologies of the coating which then corresponds to numerous equilibria and pseudo-equilibria...|$|R
