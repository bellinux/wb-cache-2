5|$|Seeds of Evil {{features}} a single-player campaign consisting of six levels and a multiplayer mode where various players can compete {{against each other}} in several game types. It supports the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, which enables an optional high-resolution <b>graphics</b> <b>mode.</b> The game was developed over a period of 21 months and was originally intended to be released on a 12MB cartridge without a multiplayer component. When cartridges prices fell, developers ultimately decided to release it on a 32MB cartridge.|$|E
5|$|As {{a spiritual}} {{successor}} to Rare's 1997 hit GoldenEye 007, Perfect Dark shares many gameplay similarities with its predecessor and runs on a upgraded {{version of its}} engine. The game features a single-player mode that requires players to complete a series of missions under certain difficulty settings. It also features a range of multiplayer options, including a co-operative mode and traditional deathmatch settings. Perfect Dark was developed {{over the course of}} three years and is technically one of the most advanced games for the Nintendo 64, offering an optional high resolution <b>graphics</b> <b>mode,</b> widescreen support, and Dolby's surround sound. A Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak is required to access the game's single-player mode and most of the multiplayer features.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81's primary input/output is {{delivered}} via four sockets {{on the left}} side of the case. The machine uses an ordinary UHF television set to deliver a monochrome picture via a built-in RF modulator. It can display 24 lines of 32 characters each, and by using the selection of 2×2 block character graphics from the machine's character set offers an effective 64 × 44 pixel <b>graphics</b> <b>mode,</b> also directly addressable via BASIC using the PLOT and UNPLOT commands, leaving 2 lines free at the bottom. Two 3.5mm jacks connect the ZX81 to the EAR (output) and MIC (input) sockets of an audio cassette recorder, enabling data to be saved or loaded. This uses an unusual PWM encoding at a single frequency, giving an average rate of 307 bps nominal, varying between 400 bps for all '0's, to 250 bps for all '1's. This provides a somewhat temperamental storage medium for the machine, which has no built-in storage capabilities. The ZX81 requires 420 mA of power at 7–11 V DC, delivered via a custom 9 V Sinclair DC power supply.|$|E
25|$|IBM {{intended}} that CGA {{be compatible}} with a home television set. The 40×25 text and 320×200 <b>graphics</b> <b>modes</b> are usable with a television, and the 80×25 text and 640×200 <b>graphics</b> <b>modes</b> are intended for a monitor.|$|R
50|$|Generally, text modes are not all-points-addressable, whereas <b>graphics</b> <b>modes</b> are. With {{the advent}} of more {{powerful}} computer graphics hardware, the use and importance of text-only display modes has declined, and with <b>graphics</b> <b>modes</b> it is generally taken for granted that they are all-points-addressable.|$|R
50|$|The <b>graphic</b> <b>modes</b> of the Apple II series were {{peculiar}} even by {{the standards}} of the late 1970s and early 1980s. One notable peculiarity of these modes is a direct result of Apple founder Steve Wozniak's chip-saving design. Many home computer systems of the time (as well as today's PC-compatible machines) had architecture which assigned consecutive blocks of memory to non-consecutive rows on the screen in <b>graphic</b> <b>modes,</b> i.e., interleaving. Apple's text and <b>graphics</b> <b>modes</b> are based on two different interleave factors of 8:1 and 64:1.|$|R
25|$|The game {{uses the}} CGA display mode, the only colour <b>graphics</b> <b>mode</b> {{available}} on the original IBM PC. The mode allows four colours but in DONKEY.BAS there are usually only three on screen.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, the BBC Micro based OBBS software, {{available}} from Pace {{for use with}} their modems, optionally allowed for color and graphics using the Teletext based <b>graphics</b> <b>mode</b> available on that platform. Other systems used the Viewdata protocols made popular in the UK by British Telecom's Prestel service, and the on-line magazine Micronet 800 whom were busy giving away modems with their subscriptions.|$|E
25|$|The Acorn BBC Micro's default <b>graphics</b> <b>mode</b> (mode 7) {{was based}} on Teletext display, and the {{computer}} {{could be used to}} create and serve Teletext-style pages over a modem connection. With a suitable adapter, the computer could receive and display teletext pages, as well as software over the BBC's Ceefax service, for a time. The Philips P2000 homecomputer's video logic was also based on a chip designed to provide teletext services in TVs.|$|E
50|$|The Tiki-100 has 3 {{different}} <b>graphics</b> <b>modes,</b> but no text-mode {{as it used}} bitmapped graphics only. However, terminal emulators provided {{options of}} 40, 80 or 160 by 25 characters, each option {{using one of the}} three modes. All of the <b>graphics</b> <b>modes</b> have hardware vertical scroll.|$|R

25|$|COCONET, a BBS system made by Coconut Computing, Inc., was {{released}} in 1988 and only supported a GUI (no text interface was initially available but eventually became available around 1990), and worked in EGA/VGA <b>graphics</b> <b>mode,</b> which made it {{stand out from the}} text-based BBS systems. COCONET's bitmap and vector graphics and support for multiple type fonts were inspired by the PLATO system, and the graphics capabilities were based on what was available in the Borland BGI graphics library. A competing approach called Remote Imaging Protocol (RIP) emerged and was promoted by Telegrafix in the early to mid-1990s but it never became widespread. An industry standard technology called NAPLPS was also considered, and although it became the underlying graphics technology behind the Prodigy service, it never gained popularity in the BBS market. There were several GUI-based BBSes on the Apple Macintosh platform, including TeleFinder and FirstClass, but these remained widely used only in the Mac market.|$|E
500|$|Work on Perfect Dark {{began with}} the same team that {{developed}} GoldenEye 007. The developers upgraded the GoldenEye 007 engine with new features and graphical enhancements such as dynamic lighting, widescreen support, and the option to play in high resolution <b>graphics</b> <b>mode.</b> According to Rare, only 30% of the original engine remained, providing a basic framework to construct levels and animate characters. A new movement system was constructed, allowing players to fall off edges. Motion capture was used to create character animations: game designer Duncan Botwood wore a pair of high heels {{so that he could}} portray Joanna Dark in these sessions. The artificial intelligence was improved so that enemies could [...] "assess threats, work as a team and communicate with each other." [...] Enemies were also given the ability to draw a secondary sidearm when disarmed. Other additions include more elaborate gore effects, which allow gunshots to disperse and stain enemies' blood onto nearby walls and objects, and a motion blurred graphical effect when the player is punched or tranquilised.|$|E
500|$|The PC version did not fare as well. Rick Broida of Computer Gaming World criticised {{the lack}} of multiplayer, the high system requirements, and the difficulty. Despite these criticisms, he complimented the {{improved}} graphics and tracks over the original. Sean Anderson of Gamezilla criticised the way the game handles multiplayer and described the commentator as [...] "annoying". Frederick Claude of Coming Soon Magazine compared the PC version to the PlayStation version and believed the PC version's multiplayer support via DirectPlay to be an improvement over the PlayStation version's multiplayer. For the graphics, he described the PlayStation version as [...] "far more beautiful" [...] than the PC version and criticised the SVGA <b>graphics</b> <b>mode</b> for its high system requirements. Tim Soete of GameSpot described the PC version's graphics as an improvement over those of the original, but {{not as good as}} the PlayStation version. [...] He also criticised the cars for being [...] "impossible" [...] to overtake. Craig Majaski of Gamer's Zone complimented the sound and music, describing them as [...] "top-notch", but criticised the difficulty, saying the computer cars are [...] "almost impossible" [...] to beat. He described Destruction Derby 2 as [...] "an average game that could have been an excellent title". Thierry Falcoz of [...] said that Reflections made the mistake of sacrificing playability for [...] "non-progressive" [...] difficulty, which took pleasure from crashing into opponents away because they disappear [...] "to the horizon" [...] and are not seen again.|$|E

500|$|Three {{reviewers for}} Computer Gaming World had {{conflicting}} reactions. Ken St. Andre—designer of the Tunnels & Trolls RPG—approved {{of the game}} despite his dislike of the D system, praising the art, the mixture of combat and puzzles, and surprises. He concluded, [...] "take it from a 'rival' designer, Pool of Radiance has my recommendation for every computer fantasy role-playing gamer". Tracie Forman Hicks, however, stated that over-faithful use of the D system left it behind others like Ultima and Wizardry. She also disliked the game's puzzles and lengthy combat sequences. Scorpia also disliked the amount of fighting in a game she otherwise described as a [...] "well-designed slicer/dicer", concluding that [...] "patience (possibly of Job) [...] required {{to get through this}} one". Shay Addams from Compute! stated that experienced role-playing gamers [...] "won't find anything new here", but recommended it to those who [...] "love dungeons, dragons, and drama". In their March 1989 [...] "The Role of Computers" [...] column in Dragon magazine #143, Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser (often called [...] "The Lessers") gave Pool of Radiance a three-page review. The reviewers praised Pool of Radiance as [...] "the first offering that truly follows AD game rules", calling it a [...] "great fantasy role-playing game" [...] that [...] "falls into the must-buy category for avid AD game players". The reviewers advised readers to [...] "rush out to your local dealer and buy Pool Of Radiance". They considered it SSI's flagship product, speculating that it would [...] "undoubtedly bring thousands of computer enthusiasts into the adventure-filled worlds of TSR". The Dragon reviewers criticized the [...] "notoriously slow" [...] technology of the C64/128 system but added that the C64/128 version would become nearly unplayable without a software-based fastloader utility which Strategic Simulations integrated into the game. Conversely, the reviewers felt that the MS-DOS version was extremely fast, so much so that they had to slow the game operation down in order to read all the on-screen messages. They found that the MS-DOS version played at twice the speed of the C64/128 version when using the Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) <b>graphics</b> <b>mode.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} demo's release some enthusiasts found that, by {{manipulating}} the configuration files, {{most of the}} [...] "very high" [...] graphics settings (normally reserved for DX10) could be activated under DX9. The [...] "very high" [...] DX9 <b>graphics</b> <b>mode</b> looks almost identical to the DX10 mode, with certain graphical features {{not being able to}} be reproduced correctly under DX9, such as Object Motion Blur.|$|E
