25|$|The {{original}} {{proposal for the}} <b>European</b> <b>Super</b> <b>League</b> in 1995 was for two French clubs, with both Paris and Toulouse being proposed. This was subsequently reduced to one, after much discussion among clubs. In February 1996, a French team, Paris Saint-Germain was formed {{to take part in}} the otherwise English Super League. The players being drawn from the French league. It was abandoned in October 1997, partly because Paris was not in the southern heartland of French rugby league and partly because the players had the double burden of playing for both Paris and their original club.|$|E
25|$|While the Super League war {{was being}} fought in Australia, Rupert Murdoch {{approached}} the British clubs {{with a view}} to forming a <b>European</b> <b>Super</b> <b>League,</b> primarily as a way to gain the upper hand during his battle with Kerry Packer for broadcasting rights for the sport in Australia. A large sum of money from News Corporation's UK subsidiary, BSkyB, helped fund the proposal. The new competition got under way in 1996. As part of the deal, rugby league switched from a winter to a summer season. The British, Australian and New Zealand seasons are now played concurrently from March to October, and major international tournaments are now largely played in November. The French, however, have continued to play a winter season.|$|E

The first match of its kind was played in 1976 and it was then played sporadically throughout the late 80s, and 90s including a one off Super League tournament in 1997, before becoming a regular annual pre-season fixture since 2000.

Toulouse Olympique later returned to the British league system, beginning play in the third-level League 1 in 2016 and earning promotion to the Championship for 2017.

25|$|Despite {{having more}} {{resources}} than other Scottish clubs, the Old Firm experienced difficulty in competing with big clubs from other leagues {{in terms of}} transfer fees and player wages due to the SPL's relatively low television revenue. A recurring theme during {{the existence of the}} SPL was the prospect of the two clubs leaving the Scottish football set-up to join the English football league system, an Atlantic League with clubs from countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal, or forming a new <b>European</b> <b>Super</b> <b>League.</b> While some observers believed the departure of the Old Firm from the Scottish football setup would be detrimental to Scottish football as a whole, others, such as Craig Levein, believed it would benefit Scottish football due to increased competition among the remaining clubs for the SPL title. World football's governing body FIFA ruled out the prospect of any Old Firm move to the English set-up. The duopoly was effectively broken when Rangers entered administration in 2012 and was liquidated after it failed to reach an agreement with creditors. Rangers was relaunched by a new company and were voted into the Scottish Football League Third Division.|$|E
500|$|To reinvigorate the European Champion Clubs' Cup, the {{competition}} was expanded and rebranded as the UEFA Champions League in 1992. From the 1997–98 season, it was further expanded to include eight domestic league runners-up selected by a UEFA coefficient and preliminary spots the following season were awarded to the third placed team; in some leagues fourth from 2002–03. The expansion and constant growth of {{the competition}} led to {{the decline of the}} Cup Winners' Cup, abolished in 1999 and by which point instigated proposals for a <b>European</b> <b>Super</b> <b>League.</b> Arsène Wenger has, on numerous occasions predicted the latter, arguing the pressure of television companies will force it to happen: [...] "It's all about money. More games equal more money through TV revenue and I think the next few years will see not just two, but three or four teams from the top countries competing against each other. It's what television wants – big teams in big matches. That is why the Champions' League was introduced." [...] Although Arsenal qualified for a fifteenth successive season of Champions League football in May 2012, this coincided with the club not winning a domestic honour since 2005, which led to open criticism over the competition's present format. Wenger however has gone on to defend the club policy, stating a trophy for Arsenal is winning the Premier League or the Champions League; [...] "Would you like to finish tenth in the league but win the League Cup and say you have won a trophy? Certainly not." ...|$|E
