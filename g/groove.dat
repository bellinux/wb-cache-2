Above the hilum of the lung is an arched <b>groove</b> for the azygos vein, and above this is a wide <b>groove</b> for the superior vena cava and right brachiocephalic vein; behind this, and close {{to the top of the}} lung is a <b>groove</b> for the brachiocephalic artery.

5|$|Twin helical strands {{form the}} DNA backbone. Another double helix {{may be found}} tracing the spaces, or grooves, between the strands. These voids are {{adjacent}} to the base pairs and may provide a binding site. As the strands are not symmetrically located with respect to each other, the grooves are unequally sized. One <b>groove,</b> the major <b>groove,</b> is 22Å wide and the other, the minor <b>groove,</b> is 12Å wide. The width of the major <b>groove</b> means that {{the edges of the}} bases are more accessible in the major <b>groove</b> than in the minor <b>groove.</b> As a result, proteins such as transcription factors that can bind to specific sequences in double-stranded DNA usually make contact with the sides of the bases exposed in the major <b>groove.</b> This situation varies in unusual conformations of DNA within the cell (see below), but the major and minor grooves are always named to reflect the differences in size that would be seen if the DNA is twisted back into the ordinary B form.|$|E

While generally considered an alternative metal and nu metal band, the band has also been labeled as heavy metal, grunge, hard rock, rap metal, funk metal, <b>groove</b> metal and industrial metal. Their debut album mixed metal, funk, hip-hop, <b>groove,</b> and dissonance. Their lyrics focus on pain and personal alienation rather than traditional heavy metal themes. In Nu-metal: The Next Generation of Rock & Punk, Korn was marked as the third biggest nu metal band in the world.|$|E

40|$|Craters {{within the}} Ganymede Jg- 7 {{quadrangle}} {{were divided into}} seven mappable units. The units represent: (1) irregular or elongate craters, (2) craters with dark ejecta, (3) palimpsests, (4) secondary craters, (5) and craters of young, mature, and old age. Symbols used for crater floors include: (1) flat floors, (2) floors with pits, (3) floora with a central dome or peak, (4) and floors with a central dome and pit. <b>Grooved</b> terrains were divided into five mappable units. Three units of light <b>grooved</b> material represent small, medium, and large <b>grooves,</b> which are arbitrarily divided. The other two units of <b>grooved</b> terrain represent dark <b>grooved</b> materials, and reticulate <b>grooves.</b> Two units of ungrooved dark terrain and two units of ungrooved light terrain were defined.

30|$|More interestingly, NS/(LBPS and HBPS) systems also {{produced}} {{different types of}} <b>grooved</b> texture (Fig.  5). For BuOH/DCM, the electrospinning process was highly unstable and often interrupted by severe needle clogging. However, the 1 : 1 solvent ratio produced double <b>grooved</b> fibers with surface pores and beads, while 1 : 2 resulted in <b>grooved</b> fibers and 1 : 3 led to a wrinkled surface. In this case, the <b>grooved</b> and wrinkled morphologies are both caused by buckling instability under different driving forces. In other words, <b>grooved</b> texture will be formed when the driving force is sufficient, and a lower driving force resulted in wrinkled texture. BuOH/THF {{also produced}} <b>grooved</b> fibers. The 1 : 1 solvent ratio resulted in fibers with small <b>grooves</b> on the surface, and a lower solvent ratio led to more distinct <b>grooved</b> texture. BuOH/DMF contributed to fibers with rough surface. BuOH/CYCo produced double <b>grooved</b> fibers when the ratio is 1 : 1, whereas a lower ratio resulted in beaded fibers.|$|R

The <b>groove,</b> termed a siphonophore, is ciliated, and helps to move food particles inwards and circulate water through the gastrovascular cavity.|$|E

5|$|Compared to B-DNA, the A-DNA form is a wider {{right-handed}} spiral, with a shallow, wide minor <b>groove</b> and a narrower, deeper major <b>groove.</b> The A form occurs under non-physiological {{conditions in}} partly dehydrated samples of DNA, {{while in the}} cell it may be produced in hybrid pairings of DNA and RNA strands, and in enzyme-DNA complexes. Segments of DNA where the bases have been chemically modified by methylation may undergo a larger change in conformation and adopt the Z form. Here, the strands turn about the helical axis in a left-handed spiral, {{the opposite of the}} more common B form. These unusual structures can be recognized by specific Z-DNA binding proteins and may be involved in the regulation of transcription.|$|E
30|$|In this study, we have {{successfully}} fabricated electrospun polystyrene (PS) nanofibers having {{a diameter of}} 326 [*]±[*] 50  nm with a parallel <b>grooved</b> texture using a mixed solvent of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). We discovered that solvent system, solution concentration, and relative humidity were the three key factors {{to the formation of}} <b>grooved</b> texture and the diameter of nanofibers. We demonstrated that <b>grooved</b> nanofibers with desired properties (e.g., different numbers of <b>grooves,</b> widths between two adjacent <b>grooves,</b> and depths of <b>grooves)</b> could be electrospun under certain conditions. When THF/DMF ratio was higher than 2 : 1, the formation mechanism of single <b>grooved</b> texture should be attributed to the formation of voids on the jet surface at the early stage of electrospinning and subsequent elongation and solidification of the voids into a line surface structure. When THF/DMF ratio was 1 : 1, the formation mechanism of <b>grooved</b> texture should be ascribed to the formation of wrinkled surface on the jet surface at the early stage of electrospinning and subsequent elongation into a <b>grooved</b> texture. Such findings can serve as guidelines for the preparation of <b>grooved</b> nanofibers with desired secondary morphology.|$|R

30|$|We have {{demonstrated}} the feasibility to directly electrospin <b>grooved</b> PS fibers by systematically investigating both single and binary solvent systems at given parameters. We found that single solvent systems produced non-grooved fibers. LBPS/DMF solvent systems generated fibers with different <b>grooved</b> textures, while LBPS/CYCo led to fibers with double <b>grooved</b> texture. <b>Grooved</b> fibers can also be fabricated from LBPS/LBPS, NS/LBPS, and NS/HBPS systems under specific conditions. The results indicated that <b>grooved</b> fibers can be fabricated from binary solvent systems {{as long as the}} DER is high enough. The formation of <b>grooved</b> texture should be attributed to three mechanisms, namely void-based elongation, wrinkle-based elongation, and collapsed jet-based elongation.|$|R
