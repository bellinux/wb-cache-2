40|$|In my {{bachelor}} thesis called "The {{evaluation of}} flood control {{measures in the}} town of Český Krumlov, the financing of these measures and the consequences of their implementation. " I deal with the evaluation of flood control measures and their effectiveness and sufficiency {{in the town of}} Český Krumlov. During the history the town and its inhabitants have faced the devastating effects of various floods and therefore on of the town main interest is the focus on protection against the floods. In my bachelor thesis I therefore tried {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} flood control measures carried out in the town Český Krumlov. In the theoretical part of my work I describe the general aspects of floods. I explain and further characterize the term floods and its different types. Parts of it are also factors that contribute to the rise and course of floods and the impact of habited on its formation. An important part of my work is the characterization of main floods that occurred in the Czech republic between the years 1997 and 2013 on the bases of which the improvement of flood control measures took place. I also focus on the damages caused by the floods that we are able to divide between quantifiable and inquantifiable. The theoretical part also consists of the actual protection against floods. The Czech republic under the terms of this protection made a document called "Strategy of protection against floods in the Czech republic. " The protection against floods also represent flood commissions and planning that I mention in my work as well. In the following part I describe different parts of flood control measures. Due to the high coats of the flood control measures, in the last part of my work, I describe the financial sources used in the <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>grants</b> from the programs of the EU as well as the Czech state. In the research part of my work I describe the methodies of my work. My research question is: Are the flood control measures in Český Krumlov sufficient? The goals of my work are: To determine the financial security of the flood control measures in the town of Český Krumlov and to evaluate and determine effects and consequences of the flood control measures for the habitants of Český Krumlov. In order to complete my bachelor thesis I used professional literature related to the topic as well as the information available from the world wide web, current valid legislation and consultations with a local citizen of Český Krumlov. In the characteristics of the town of Český Krumlov I described its location, administrative definition and the main watercourses of the river Vltava and the stream Polečnice. I described the flood control measures implemented in the town of Český Krumlov since 2002 in the chapter called "results". These measures were divided by the project into 5 phases and included: dredging of the channel of the river Vltava and its bank reinforcement, reconstruction of the weir Jelení lávka, mobile barriers, raising the embankment wall, individual adjustments to the existing buildings, expanding channel, excavation of silt and modification to utility lines. The implementation of the works is described in each individual chapter. Furthermore I describe the reasons that led to the termination of works on the flood control measures based on the petition of the local citizens. I also mention the report of the ministry of the environment regarding the 2013 flood and its effectiveness. At the end of this chapter I characterize the financial resources that were used by the projects implementation of the flood control measures. In the part "discussion" based on results I evaluate the realization of the financial securities of the flood control measures in the town of Český Krumlov. Furthermore I do the same, but this time based on testimonies of citizens of Český Krumlov and the report by the ministry of the environment. In conclusion I describe all the findings from my work...|$|E
