40|$|Metal-supported solid {{oxide fuel}} cells are {{expected}} to offer several potential advantages over conventional anode (Ni-YSZ) supported cells, such as increased resistance against mechanical and thermal stresses {{and a reduction in}} materials cost. When Ni-YSZ based anodes are used in metal supported SOFC, electrode material from the active anode layer may interdiffuse with the metallic support during sintering. The purpose of this work is to illustrate how the interdiffusion problem can be circumvented by using an alternative anode design based on porous and <b>electronically</b> <b>conducting</b> <b>layers,</b> into which electrocatalytically active materials are infiltrated after sintering. The paper presents the recent results on the electrochemical performance and durability of the novel planar metal-supported SOFC design. The results presented in the paper show that the novel cell and anode design has a promising performance and durability at a broad range of temperatures and is especially suitable for intermediate temperature operation...|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} improvement in power output is achieved by percolation of catalyst elements into the YSZ electrolyte surface during fabrication of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). The resulting surface is referred to hereafter as a domain. The catalysts al low the electrochemical reactions {{to take place in}} the domain. Together with current collecting electrodes on the domains, a novel SOFC structure is fabricated. On the cathode domain Mn and Ce and on the anode domain Ni, Ru, and Pd are able to catalyze the reactions. The current and power densities of such cells are significantly higher than those obtained in the conventional sandwich type SOFC. The dispersion of electrocatalysts in the domain helps to achieve lower electrode overpotentials, because of its nanometr ic size. A redox mechan ism is invoked for the catalysts in the domain. By using a less efficient oxygen reduction electrocatalyst such as Pt over the domains, it is shown that the electrode reaction occurs more easily in the domain and the contribution f rom the <b>electronically</b> <b>conduct</b> ing <b>layer</b> is predominant ly charge collection. A friable layer of lanthanum strontium mangan i te can function as a good contact cathode over the domain. Pure Ni paint when applied over anodic domains is an excellent contact electrode...|$|R

The DET via outer {{membrane}} cytochromes {{requires the}} cytochrome (the bacterial cell) {{to be physically}} adhered to the fuel cell anode. When a biofilm is formed, only bacteria in the first monolayer at the anode surface are electrochemically active [30]. Thus, the maximum cell density in this bacterial monolayer usually influences the MFC performance. However, {{it has been shown}} that some Geobacter and the Shewanella strains can evolve <b>electronically</b> <b>conducting</b> molecular pili (nanowires of 2 to 3 μm long, made of fibrous protein structures [33]) that make the microorganism able to reach and use more distant solid electron acceptors [34, 35]. The pili are connected to the membrane-bound cytochromes and allow transference of the electrons to the distant electron acceptors without cellular contact (Figure  2 B). Thus, thicker electroactive biofilms can be formed to increase anode performance. It was shown that fuel cell performance can be increased up to tenfold upon nanowire formation of Geobacter sulfurreducens[35].|$|R

40|$|AbstractHigh Temperature Superconducting (HTS) {{power cable}} {{consists}} of a <b>conducting</b> <b>layer</b> and a shield layer for carrying the required current. Geometrically, the <b>conducting</b> and shield <b>layers</b> each have self inductance; and the mutual inductance exists between the <b>conducting</b> and shield <b>layers.</b> Therefore, {{the direction of the}} current of shield the layer is opposite that of the <b>conducting</b> <b>layer</b> current. The value of the shield layer current is over 95 % of the <b>conducting</b> <b>layer</b> current at the steady state. However, if a fault current passes through an HTS power cable, the quench occurs in both the <b>conducting</b> and shield <b>layers.</b> After the quench, resistance appears, and the even self inductance values are not changed a great deal, but the mutual inductance value is directly affected.
