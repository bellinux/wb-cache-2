5|$|By around 1900, {{there were}} {{between five and}} seven {{services}} operating daily along the Cheddar Valley Line, with a mixed mail train on Sundays. Traffic was to increase from 1901 {{with the opening of}} the Wrington Vale Light Railway. Although this line joined the Cheddar Valley Line at , most services continued to Yatton. In 1901 there were four passenger trains per day and one <b>goods</b> <b>train,</b> which increased to five passenger trains per day by 1903. The line was known for the transport of mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|Green Park {{railway station}} opened in 1870 as the {{terminus}} of Midland Railway's Mangotsfield and Bath Branch Line. For {{some of its}} life, it was known as Bath Queen Square. It includes a vaulted glass roof in a single-span wrought iron arch structure. Parts of the distinctive glass roof were damaged during bombing raids in April 1942, and the glazing was not re-instated during railway usage after the war. Following the Beeching Report, passenger trains ceased from 1966 and the last <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> ran in 1971. In the 1980s the rail approaches to the station were redeveloped as a major supermarket opened in December 1982, and the station itself {{is used as a}} pedestrian passageway to and from the city; {{there are a number of}} small shop units in the former station buildings.|$|E
5|$|Royton {{railway station}} {{lay at the}} end of a branch from Royton Junction on the Oldham Loop Line, which was part of the route which {{connected}} Manchester, Oldham and Rochdale. The station was opened in 1864 and closed in April 1966. It featured steep gradients on the line up to Royton Junction, which, in October 1908, caused an accident when a <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> ran out of control on the gradient down to the station, killing a fireman. In February 1961, a four-coach runaway train crashed through the buffers at Royton railway station and continued on over High Barn Street. Five houses were damaged. The driver of the train was injured, but there were no fatal or severe injuries to the public. Five people from the damaged houses were taken to hospital suffering from shock and bruises, and in one case a fractured clavicle.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} were operated {{as single}} units on light local passenger trains, double-headed on mainline passenger <b>trains</b> and light <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> or triple-headed on heavy <b>goods</b> <b>trains.</b>|$|R
50|$|After that <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> {{ran over}} the more level line through Grauhof, whilst {{passenger}} trains ran via Goslar. In addition local <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> also served Langelsheim, Herzog-Julius-Hütte and Goslar.|$|R
5000|$|The {{line had}} been built {{primarily}} to handle the many <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> that ran between Lancashire and Yorkshire. A typical weekday in Autumn 1952 saw at least thirty-seven eastbound <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> running into Yorkshire using the Micklehurst Loop and a similar number of westbound trains. The loop had easier gradients than the original line through Mossley and Greenfield and this caused most of the heavy <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> to use it.|$|R
5|$|After Watkin's {{retirement}} from management, {{relations between the}} MR and GCR deteriorated rapidly over shared use of Baker Street station and the congested route into London, and soon broke down completely. On 30 July 1898 John Bell, General Manager of the Metropolitan Railway, {{took control of the}} Quainton Road signal box himself and refused to allow a GCR train onto MR-owned tracks {{on the grounds that it}} was scheduled to take the Great Western rather than the Metropolitan route south of Aylesbury, while on one occasion in 1901 King Edward VII was travelling home after visiting a friend in Wendover; the MR signalman allowed a slow <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> to run in front of the royal train, causing the King to arrive late back in London. The MR management also refused the GCR permission to install points to connect their engine shed at Aylesbury to the railway line, on the grounds that the land for the shed had been bought clandestinely. Eventually a parallel set of tracks was built for the GCR between Harrow and London, running alongside the MR to a separate terminus at Marylebone, a short distance from Baker Street. The GCR continued to share the less-congested section between Quainton Road and Harrow—including Chalfont Road station—with the MR.|$|E
5|$|The winter {{affected}} {{many other}} European countries. Similar cold periods and snowfalls {{were seen in}} much of Central Europe and the southern Baltic region. De Bilt, near Amsterdam in the Netherlands, experienced its worst winter since 1790. Because of the anticyclone {{to the north of}} the United Kingdom several incoming Atlantic depressions which would normally have hit Britain were forced south to the Mediterranean region, resulting in Portugal, Spain and Southern France having more rain than usual while remaining relatively warm. For example, the February rainfall at Gibraltar was , three times the average. As a result, France experienced both the extreme cold in the north, and much rain in the south. The winter caused 150 deaths from the cold and lack of food in Berlin, which was still recovering from its devastation during the final stages of the Second World War. It forced schools in the Netherlands to shut, led to a mob attack on a <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> carrying coal in Copenhagen, and caused the closure of businesses and the restriction of domestic gas supplies in the Republic of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, the Corporation {{had made}} {{enquiries}} about purchasing a second-hand steam engine, approaching six locomotive manufacturers, but eventually acquired a new 0-4-0 saddle tank from Peckett and Sons Ltd, {{which was built}} at their Bristol works in 1918. The original engine became a spare, but was hired out to the Blackburn Meadows power station in March 1936. A year later it was condemned by the insurance company, and was sold for scrap to Maden and McKee Ltd, who were based in Liverpool. A replacement was sought, and a third 0-4-0 saddle tank, made by Hudswell Clarke in 1914, was bought from the Olympia Oil and Cake Company at Selby. It was coupled into a <b>goods</b> <b>train,</b> and arrived at the works in July 1937. At the works, as at Selby, it carried the name Olympia, painted on the tanks. The Peckett was overhauled by the Yorkshire Engine Company at Meadow Hall Works between 1945 and 1946. Because there was a statutory obligation to keep the treatment works operational, a special dispensation was obtained during the 1926 general strike, to allow this engine to run over the main line, delivering wagons to Kilnhurst tip. Kilnhurst tip eventually became full, and in January 1948, regular tipping operations ceased, after a new tip at Thrybergh opened. Tipping continued at Kilnhurst sporadically, until it was closed in 1959. During its operational life up to 1948, 2,917,480 tons of sewage sludge was dumped at the site, and following closure, it was sold to the National Coal Board in 1961.|$|E
50|$|The <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> hauled {{agricultural}} {{products in the}} main, but the transportation of logs was also important. The only industries were in Celle.Military transportation to the various military installations was also important. Even after the Second World War further military facilities were added and, on many stations, tank-loading ramps were built. Until 1978 the DB also ran <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> through the line because the distances were shorter than on their own DB lines; towards the end this amounted to 135,000 t per year. In 2006 three <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> ran on the line each week, as well as ad hoc <b>trains</b> and <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> hauled by the OHE between DBAG routes.|$|R
50|$|During the 1920s, <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> {{would have}} been hauled by Z25-class locomotive. In the 1930s, 30T and 50 class {{locomotives}} {{would have been}} rostered. Locomotives and their crews were based at Culcairn. <b>Goods</b> <b>trains</b> appear to have worked mostly on Tuesdays.|$|R
50|$|Under {{agreements}} of 1860 {{incorporated into}} Acts of Parliament, the GWR continued to run broad gauge <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> to Crediton until {{the abolition of}} broad gauge on 20 May 1892; narrow gauge GWR <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> continued operating until 1 October 1903.|$|R
25|$|On 25 October 1928, a <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> {{broke down}} at , Dumfriesshire. An express {{passenger}} train {{was in a}} rear-end collision with it due to errors by the guard of the <b>goods</b> <b>train</b> and a signalman. Four {{people were killed and}} five were injured.|$|E

50|$|The station {{had a great}} {{importance}} in freight operations for a long time. Thus, in 1934, it already had a diesel locomotive of the Kö I class. After the Second World War, a shunting locomotive from Pirmasens freight yard operated local <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> (Nahgüterzug). In the 1980s, two local <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> from Einsiedlerhof marshalling yard on the Mannheim-Saarbrücken railway served the station as well as Pirmasens and its surroundings. At the same time, local <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> were also operated from Pirmasens Nord station, where a <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> bound for the stations of Waldfischbach, Steinalben and Schopp was separated {{from the rest of}} the train. The former loading track in Schopp station was subsequently dismantled.|$|R
50|$|These {{days the}} classic {{categories}} of <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> no longer really exist, rather the Deutsche Bahn's regional <b>goods</b> <b>trains</b> {{are more like}} a mixture of Üg and Ng trains. They are referred to by the DB as Cargobedienung (CB, i.e. cargo service) trains.|$|R
