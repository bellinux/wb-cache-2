5|$|The elite, hand-selected {{audience}} members favored with admission to performances by the concerto delle donne demanded diversions and entertainment beyond {{the pleasures of}} beautiful music alone. During the concerts, members of the concertos audience would sometimes play cards. Orazio Urbani, ambassador of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, having waited several years to see the concerto, complained that he was forced not only to play cards, distracting him from the performance, but also simultaneously admire and praise the women's music to their patron Alfonso. After at least one concert, to continue the entertainment, a dwarf couple danced. Alfonso was not as interested in these peripheral entertainments, and in one instance excused himself from the party to <b>go</b> <b>sit</b> under a tree {{to listen to the}} ladies, and follow along with the madrigal texts and musical scores, including embellishments, which were made available to listeners.|$|E

6000|$|Johnny Chuck obediently sat up, and {{of course}} all the others stared at him. It made him feel quite uncomfortable.

There was an almost {{imperceptible}} movement {{on the part of}} the new life that lay in the hollow of Ameera's arm. 'Aho!' she said, her voice breaking with love. 'The babe is a champion from his birth. He is kicking me in the side with mighty kicks. Was there ever such a babe! And he is ours to us--thine and mine. Put thy hand on his head, but carefully, for he is very young, and men are unskilled in such matters.' ...|$|E

6000|$|At length the fool, whom my {{companion}} called the wizard, came in, muttering between his teeth, [...] "Damn book-pedlers,--all the {{time talking about}} books. Better do something. Damn 'em. I'll shoot 'em. Got a doctor down here. Damn him, I'll get a gun and shoot him"; never once holding up his head. Whereat the old man {{stood up and said}} in a loud voice, as if he was accustomed to command, and {{this was not the first}} time he had been obliged to exert his authority there: [...] "John, <b>go</b> <b>sit</b> down, mind your business,--we've heard you talk before,--precious little you'll do,--your bark is worse than your bite." [...] But, without minding, John muttered the same gibberish over again, and then sat down at the table which the old folks had left. He ate all there was on it, and then turned to the apples, which his aged mother was paring, that she might give her guests some apple-sauce for breakfast, but she drew them away and sent him off.|$|E
6000|$|To {{say what}} good of fashion we can, it rests on reality, and hates {{nothing so much}} as pretenders; to exclude and mystify pretenders and send them into {{everlasting}} 'Coventry,' is its delight. We contemn in turn every other gift of men of the world; but the habit even in little and the least matters of not appealing to any but our own sense of propriety, constitutes the foundation of all chivalry. There is almost no kind of self-reliance, so it be sane and proportioned, which fashion does not occasionally adopt and give it the freedom of its saloons. A sainted soul is always elegant, and, if it will, passes unchallenged into the most guarded ring. But so will Jock the teamster pass, in some crisis that brings him thither, and find favor, as long as his head is not giddy with the new circumstance, and the iron shoes do not wish to dance in waltzes and cotillons. For there is nothing settled in manners, but the laws of behavior yield to the energy of the individual. The maiden at her first ball, the country-man at a city dinner, believes that there is a ritual according to which every act and compliment must be performed, or the failing party must be cast out of this presence. Later they learn that good sense and character make their own forms every moment, and speak or abstain, take wine or refuse it, stay or <b>go,</b> <b>sit</b> in a chair or sprawl with children on the floor, or stand on their head, or what else soever, in a new and aboriginal way; and that strong will is always in fashion, let who will be unfashionable. All that fashion demands is composure and self-content. A circle of men perfectly well-bred would be a company of sensible persons in which every man's native manners and character appeared. If the fashionist have not this quality, he is nothing. We are such lovers of self-reliance that we excuse in a man many sins if he will show us a complete satisfaction in his position, which asks no leave to be, of mine, or any man's good opinion. But any deference to some eminent man or woman of the world, forfeits all privilege of nobility. He is an underling: I {{have nothing to do with}} him; I will speak with his master. A man should not go where he cannot carry his whole sphere or society with him,--not bodily, the whole circle of his friends, but atmospherically. He should preserve in a new company the same attitude of mind and reality of relation which his daily associates draw him to, else he is shorn of his best beams, and will be an orphan in the merriest club. [...] "If you could see Vich Ian Vohr with his tail on!--" [...] But Vich Ian Vohr must always carry his belongings in some fashion, if not added as honor, then severed as disgrace.|$|E
