[...] "I didn't have any misconceptions about our ability to do anything other than play music, and I was scared". Led primarily by Harrison and Lennon's interest in Eastern religion, the Beatles later travelled to Maharishi's ashram in India for further guidance. While there, they composed most of the songs for The Beatles and Abbey Road.|$|E

[...] It also won best film at the 2011 Berlin Porn Film Festival, and best film at the 2011 Erotic Awards. Reich expressed surprise at the Erotic Award, {{because he did not}} consider the film to be a work of erotica, but discovered that they'd won because they had explored [...] "an extreme fetish that to be honest we'd not actually heard of nor <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> exploring." ...|$|E

[...] "We <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> making this movie for a contemporary audience and we wanted Rapunzel to be a real role model in a way.

[...] Their concert schedule in North America doubled, seemingly overnight; they began performing up to 520 shows per year all over the world. [...] They also began to produce other stage shows in places The Wiggles themselves were unable to visit, in Australia, the UK, and US, that featured their characters, a host, and a few dancers. [...] The Age called this time period (about the mid-2000s) the group's [...] "high point"; they earned A$45 {{million a year in}} revenues, and had several licensing deals and an international distribution agreement with Disney.|$|E
500|$|In September 2008 Tower Hamlets London Borough Council named two {{tower blocks}} in Sidney Street, Peter House and Painter House; Peter the Painter was only {{involved}} in a minor capacity in the events, and was not present at the siege.

The decision angered the Metropolitan Police Federation, and a council spokesman said that [...] "There {{is no evidence that}} Peter the Painter killed the three policemen, so we <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> not naming the block after a murderer.... but he is the name that East Enders associate with the siege and Sidney Street." [...] In December 2010, on the centenary of the events at Houndsditch, a memorial plaque for the three murdered policemen was unveiled near the location. Three weeks later, on the anniversary of the siege, a plaque was unveiled in honour of Pearson, the fireman who died because the building collapsed on him.|$|E

500|$|Going {{into the}} fifth season of The X-Files, series creator Chris Carter noted, [...] "we <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{going to be}} hitting these very {{dramatic}} marks which were the mythology episodes, {{and we wanted to}} lighten, or leaven, the season with quirky episodes." [...] Carter wanted to write a Frankenstein-inspired episode, but found it difficult to reconcile Mary Shelley's unbelievable tale with the style of the show. To achieve his vision, he wrote a script that blurred the real world with the X-Files reality and that had a distinct fantasy element. Carter combined elements of the original story with fairy tales and elements of folk tales. In order to make the episode [...] "as moving" [...] as possible, Carter sought to echo elements of James Whale's 1931 film version of Frankenstein. He later noted that, by [...] "using modern science, I took an old style, which is black and white, and an old approach, which is a kind of James Whale approach to science fiction, {{and came up with a}} story about a love-lorn monster".|$|E
500|$|Anthony Mackie {{said the}} Russo {{brothers}} relied on minimal use of computer-generated imagery, stating, [...] "The Russos, {{what they did}} that was so great was, they wanted to stay with live action, which is a dying art form. If they can build it, they built it. If we could do it, we did it. They wanted to do as little CGI as possible. That's why the movie looks so great." [...] Nevertheless, six special effects companies are involved in creating the visual effects of the film, including Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Scanline VFX, Lola VFX, Luma Pictures, Whiskytree and The Embassy, with previsualization completed by Proof. The film contained 2,500 visual effects shots, with 900 worked on by ILM. The film featured extensive use of digital doubles. Russell Earl, ILM visual effects supervisor, said, [...] "The character that we did the most work on was Falcon. We <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going to do CG wings. We also did some shots with wires and some with stunt doubles and head replacement. And we needed a very good digital double." ...|$|E

500|$|The band, then named Mookie Blaylock, entered London Bridge Studios in Seattle, Washington in March 1991 with {{producer}} Rick Parashar {{to record}} its debut album. After working with Parashar on Temple Of The Dog, Stone and Jeff {{asked him to}} co-produce and engineer Ten. Parashar also contributed piano, Fender Rhodes, percussion, co-wrote vocal harmonies and co wrote the intro/outro of the album. A few tracks were previously recorded at London Bridge in January, but only [...] "Alive" [...] was carried over from that session. The album sessions were quick and lasted only a month, mainly due to the band having already written most of the material for the record. [...] "Porch", [...] "Deep", [...] "Why Go", and [...] "Garden" [...] were first recorded during the album sessions, everything else had been previously recorded during demo sessions at some point. McCready said that [...] "Ten was mostly Stone and Jeff; me and Eddie were {{along for the ride}} at that time."

On top of the low earnings from Pinocchio and Fantasia, the company had debts of $4million with the Bank of America in 1944. At a meeting with Bank of America executives to discuss {{the future of the}} company, the bank's chairman and founder, Amadeo Giannini, told his executives, [...] "I've been watching the Disneys' pictures quite closely because I <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> lending them money far above the financial risk.... They're good this year, they're good next year, and they're good the year after.... You have to relax and give them time to market their product." [...] Disney's production of short films decreased in the late 1940s, coinciding with increasing competition in the animation market from Warner Bros. and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Roy Disney, for financial reasons, suggested more combined animation and live-action productions. In 1948, Disney initiated a series of popular live-action nature films, titled True-Life Adventures, with Seal Island the first; the film won the Academy Award in the Best Short Subject (Two-Reel) category.|$|E
500|$|Three {{days after}} Leiria, Benfica {{received}} PSG {{for the second}} leg. Benfica scored their first goal in the 12th minute and another before half-time. However, the Parisians {{got back into the}} game with a goal from Pauleta. Throughout the second half, Benfica threatened Mickaël Landreau's goalposts, finally scoring near the 90th minute when Simão converted a penalty resulting from a foul on Léo. Simão told the media, [...] "We <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> stronger and had to take advantage of their mistakes. That is what he did." [...] In the quarter-finals, Benfica were due to play Spanish side Espanyol, first in Barcelona and then in Lisbon. Domestically, Benfica played Estrela da Amadora on 19 March. Because Sporting had beat Porto in the match between them, Benfica could close up their distance {{from the top of the}} table to one point if they won. At the Estádio da Reboleira, Benfica defeated Estrela 1–0 with a goal from Petit in the 81st minute. The win left Benfica with 51 points, one fewer than Porto. The Clássico was the next match; Santos lowered [...] fans' expectations by saying the league race was open for all of the Big Three and that there were still eight match-days to go before the season's end.|$|E

500|$|The {{band members}} stated that {{following}} the troublesome final years signed to Geffen Records, being an independent act again helped improve their mood and approach, with Vig remarking, [...] "There were no expectations; {{no one even}} <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> recording. So it was all under the radar and pretty casual and we all felt inspired after having that amount of time off ... when we started writing songs, they came fast and furious. We probably wrote 24, 25 songs {{over the course of}} a couple of months. Marker commented that [...] "the business stuff ends up taking over some of that fun. We got really bogged down in people's expectations of what we were supposed to be doing, being on bigger record labels and stuff. With all that behind us, it was suddenly exciting again and it felt a lot like it did when we first formed, which was really just sort of a fun idea that we had." [...] Manson added, [...] "People at record companies live in fear of being wrong. Music cannot thrive in that environment. It is an unruly art form. You can't keep treating it like sausage meat.

500|$|After the race, Espinoza said, [...] "He's OK... Maybe it {{was just}} a little too much for him those three weeks, flying back and forth.

We were all pretty disappointed... I know (Zayat) will be going back and forth... He's a sportsman for bringing him up here." [...] Five days later, Zayat announced that the horse would be kept in training with the goal to run in the Breeders' Cup Classic, stating, [...] "I believe there were a combination of factors that prevented American Pharoah from running his absolute best... I have every confidence that he can run to his best again, and he deserves the chance to do so." ...|$|E
500|$|Safran {{called the}} second season more cohesive, {{mirroring}} the first season and [...] "... keep the two-storyline structure". In an interview, he confirmed that the structure would be [...] "a little bit of flash-forward, but the majority will be what I like to call the present". According to Safran, the producers aimed at a more-mature, darker second season which would be [...] "less confusing" [...] to viewers. Safran had plotted an upcoming plot point as the first season ended, which saw Alex clearing her name, getting fired by the FBI and receiving a job offer by the CIA director. He revealed that the season-two storyline would focus on the contrasting work ethics of the FBI and the CIA. Safran elaborated {{about the differences between}} the FBI and CIA, saying: [...] "We're very interested {{in the fact that the}} FBI's so much about being honest, truthful and living up to your badge. And the CIA is the opposite. You succeed if you can deceive. So it's going to be interesting to see. It's like a funhouse mirror of what we've seen". He announced that the series would switch to a single timeline after the fourteenth episode. Safran said that {{the second season}} always intended to adopt a single timeline after the resolved storyline and the aftermath of the hostage crisis, adding [...] "When we broke Season 2, we <b>knew</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going to go to one timeline, because it’s about the [...] event, and then it’s about what happens after the event. And you can’t flashback to the Farm after the crisis is over". He said that the change was also due to viewer complaints that the first season's dual timeline was confusing.|$|E
