40|$|International {{audience}} In {{the absence}} of all-optical 3 R regenerators, the quality of transmission has a strong impact of the feasibility of all-optical long-haul transmission. Four main physical layer impairments degrade the quality of an optical analog signal, namely chromatic dispersion (CD), polarization mode dispersion (PMD), optical {{signal to noise ratio}} (OSNR), and nonlinear phase shift (PhiNL). In most previous studies, a Q factor evaluates the quality of transmission in considering the aforementioned parameters individually (Qi with <b>i</b> <b>isin</b> { 1, 2, 3, 4 }). In this paper, we propose a tool implementing a global Q factor that takes into account the interaction between the four impairments and from which we derive the bit error rate (BER). This new factor referenced as Q 8 enables to study the suitability of optical transparency in transport networks. By means of numerical applications, we compare two backbone networks: the North-American NSF network (NSFNET) and the Pan-European backbone (EBN) </p...|$|E
