5|$|Gergonne's insight {{was that}} if a line L1 could be {{constructed}} such that A1 and B1 were guaranteed to fall on it, those two points could be identified as the <b>intersection</b> <b>points</b> of L1 with the given circle C1 (Figure6). The remaining four tangent points would be located similarly, by finding lines L2 and L3 that contained A2 and B2, and A3 and B3, respectively. To construct a line such as L1, two points must be identified that lie on it; but these points need not be the tangent points. Gergonne was able to identify two other points {{for each of the}} three lines. One of the two points has already been identified: the radical center G lies on all three lines (Figure6).|$|E
5|$|Some {{of these}} special cases are {{much easier to}} solve than the general case of three given circles. The two {{simplest}} cases are the problems of drawing a circle through three given points (PPP) or tangent to three lines (LLL), which were solved first by Euclid in his Elements. For example, the PPP problem can be solved as follows. The center of the solution circle is equally distant from all three points, and therefore must lie on the perpendicular bisector line of any two. Hence, the center {{is the point of}} intersection of any two perpendicular bisectors. Similarly, in the LLL case, the center must lie on a line bisecting the angle at the three <b>intersection</b> <b>points</b> between the three given lines; hence, the center lies at the intersection point of two such angle bisectors. Since there are two such bisectors at every intersection point of the three given lines, there are four solutions to the general LLL problem.|$|E

25|$|The {{converse}} is the Braikenridge–Maclaurin theorem, {{named for}} 18th-century British mathematicians William Braikenridge and Colin Maclaurin , {{which states that}} if the three <b>intersection</b> <b>points</b> of the three pairs of lines through opposite sides of a hexagon lie on a line, then the six vertices of the hexagon lie on a conic; the conic may be degenerate, as in Pappus's theorem. The Braikenridge–Maclaurin theorem may be applied in the Braikenridge–Maclaurin construction, which is a synthetic construction of the conic defined by five points, by varying the sixth point.|$|E
25|$|Projective spaces can {{be studied}} as a {{separate}} field in mathematics, but are also used in various applied fields, geometry in particular. Geometric objects, such as points, lines, or planes, can be given a representation as elements in projective spaces based on homogeneous coordinates. As a result, various relations between these objects {{can be described in}} a simpler way than is possible without homogeneous coordinates. Furthermore, various statements in geometry can be made more consistent and without exceptions. For example, in the standard Euclidean geometry for the plane, two lines always intersect at a point except when parallel. In a projective representation of lines and points, however, such an intersection point exists even for parallel lines, and it can be computed {{in the same way as}} other <b>intersection</b> <b>points.</b>|$|E
25|$|To {{compute the}} {{intersection}} of the curve defined by the polynomial p with the line of equation ax+by+c = 0, one solves the equation of the line for x (or for y if a = 0). Substituting the result in p, one gets a univariate equation q(y) = 0 (or q(x) = 0, if the equation of the line has been solved in y), each of whose roots is one coordinate of an <b>intersection</b> <b>point.</b> The other coordinate is deduced from the equation of the line. The multiplicity of an <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> is the multiplicity of the corresponding root. There is an <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> at infinity if the degree of q is lower than the degree of p; the multiplicity of such an <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> at infinity is the difference of the degrees of p and q.|$|R

25|$|Some authors {{add more}} {{constraints}} {{to the definition}} of a drawing, for instance that each pair of edges have at most one intersection point (a shared endpoint or crossing). For the crossing number as defined above, these constraints make no difference, because a crossing-minimal drawing cannot have edges with multiple <b>intersection</b> <b>points.</b> If two edges with a shared endpoint cross, the drawing can be changed locally at the crossing point, leaving the rest of the drawing unchanged, to produce a different drawing with one fewer crossing. And similarly, if two edges cross two or more times, the drawing can be changed locally at two crossing points to make a different drawing with two fewer crossings. However, these constraints are relevant for variant definitions of the crossing number that, for instance, count only the numbers of pairs of edges that cross rather than the number of crossings.|$|E

The original approach of Apollonius of Perga has been lost, but reconstructions have been offered by François Viète and others, based on the clues in the description by Pappus.

40|$|A more {{rigorous}} algorithm is presented for correction of refraction effects in two-media stereo photogrammetry. The mid-point of the shortest line segment joining two aerial corresponding rays {{of a point}} on an underwater object {{is used as a}} photogrammetric <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> which doesn't exist when the two rays are non-intersecting. As a result, the uncertainty of the <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> is removed, the positional relationship between the <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> and the true object point becomes definite, and the refraction correction formula from the <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> to the true object point can be strictly derived. The bad effect on the refraction correction is firstly analyzed, which caused by that the two rays are non-intersecting. Then the positional relationship between the <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> and the true object point is studied. After that, the formulas regarding water depth and geodetic coordinates of points on an underwater object are deduced, that is often known as correction of refraction effects. Finally, the algorithm is tested by two experiments using the data of WorldView- 2. The results show that the algorithm is suitable for any case in which whether or not the two aerial corresponding rays of an underwater object point are intersecting, and it can significantly improve the measurement accuracy of underwater object's elevation...|$|R
40|$|The {{fields of}} {{photogrammetry}} and computer vision routinely use line-surface intersections {{to determine the}} point where a line intersects with a surface. The object coordinates of the <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> can be found using standard geometric and numeric algorithms, however expressing the spatial uncertainty at the <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> may be challenging, especially when the surface morphology is complex. This paper describes an empirical method to characterize the unknown spatial uncertainty at the <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> by propagating random errors in the stochastic model using repeated random sampling methods. These methods accommodate complex surface morphology and nonlinearities in the functional model, however the penalty is the resulting probability density function associated with the <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> may be non-Gaussian in nature. A formal hypothesis test is presented to show that straightforward statistical inference tools are available whether the data is Gaussian or not. The hypothesis test determines whether the computed <b>intersection</b> <b>point</b> is consistent with an externally-derived known truth point. A numerical example demonstrates the approach in a photogrammetric setting with a single frame image and a gridded terrain elevation model. The results show that uncertainties produced by the proposed empirical method are intuitive and can be assessed with conventional methods found in textbook hypothesis testing...|$|R
