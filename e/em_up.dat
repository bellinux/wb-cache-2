5|$|Muramasa: The Demon Blade, {{known in}} Japan as , is an action {{role-playing}} game developed by Vanillaware for the Wii home console, {{and later the}} PlayStation Vita handheld console. The original game was published in 2009 by Marvelous Entertainment (Japan), Ignition Entertainment (North America), and Rising Star Games (Europe). The Vita version was published in 2013 by Marvelous AQL in Japan and Aksys Games in Western territories. Using a 2D side-scrolling perspective, the gameplay revolves around a beat <b>em</b> <b>up</b> fighting system, while incorporating role-playing elements such as leveling and questing.|$|E

6000|$|As for old age, my Lady Lydia {{had little}} respect for that {{accident}} {{in the life of}} some gentlemen and gentlewomen; and, once the settlements were made in her behalf, treated the ancient Van den Bosch and his large periwig with no more ceremony than Dinah her black attendant, whose great ears she would pinch, and whose woolly pate she would pull without scruple, upon offence given--so at least Dinah told Gumbo, who told his master. All the household trembled before my lady the Countess: the housekeeper, of whom even my lord and the dowager had been in awe; the pampered London footmen, who used to quarrel if they were disturbed at their cards, and grumbled as they swilled the endless beer, now stepped nimbly about their business when they heard her ladyship's call; even old Lockwood, who had been gate-porter for half a century or more, tried to rally his poor old wandering wits when she came into his lodge to open his window, inspect his wood-closet, and turn his old dogs out of doors. Lockwood bared his old bald head before his new mistress, turned an appealing look towards his niece, and vaguely trembled before her little ladyship's authority. Gumbo, dressing his master for dinner, talked about Elisha (of whom he had heard the chaplain read in the morning), [...] "and his bald head and de boys who call um names, and de bars eat <b>em</b> <b>up,</b> and serve um right," [...] says Gumbo.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an on-chip, interconnect-aware methodology for high-speed analog and mixed signal (AMS) design which enables early incorporation of on-chip transmission line (T-line) components into AMS design flow. The proposed solution {{is based on}} a set of parameterized T-line structures, which include single and two coupled microstrip lines with optional side shielding, accompanied by compact true transient models. The models account for frequency dependent skin and proximity effects, while maintaining passivity requirements due to their pure RLC nature. The signal bandwidth supported by the models covers a range from DC to 100 GHz. The models are currently verified in terms of S-parameter data against hardware (up to 40 GHz) and against <b>EM</b> solver (<b>up</b> to 100 GHz).
