In the gathering phase, {{when children are}} exposed to the new language they start to hear and distinguish sounds. In the <b>key</b> <b>word</b> phase they start to identify and use <b>key</b> content <b>words.</b> For example, to express [...] "I am hungry", they would simply use the <b>key</b> <b>word</b> [...] "hungry". In the sentence phase, children begin to use phrases and complete sentences. There is a long delay from starting to distinguish sounds to being able to use complete sentences.|$|R

2500|$|Though Vendler and Booth {{understand}} the legal imagery {{in a similar}} fashion, they differ in {{their understanding of the}} couplet.

The song was provided with an early video, which opened D. A. Pennebaker's cinéma vérité presentation of Dylan's 1965 tour of Great Britain, Dont Look Back.
