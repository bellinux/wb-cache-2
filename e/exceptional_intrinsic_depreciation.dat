Therefore, the development of simple, low-cost, and scalable synthetic methods for the mass production of monodisperse, stable, and size/shape-controlled nanocrystals will be very important.|$|R
40|$|Deep K-band {{observations}} are presented {{of the double}} image quasar Q 2345 + 007. This has the largest separation (7. 1 sec) of any quasar image pair considered as gravitationally lensed, so the required lens is massive (10 (exp 13) solar masses). No lens has been detected in previous deep images at visible wavelengths, and we find no lens to limiting K magnitude 20. 0 in the infrared image. This constrains any lens to being much less luminous than brightest cluster galaxies, while the lens must be much more massive than such galaxies to produce the observed separation. Because spectral data indicate <b>exceptional</b> <b>intrinsic</b> similarity in the quasar image components, this pair remains as the most intriguing example of an observed configuration requiring the presence of massive, concentrated dark matter acting as a gravitational lens...|$|R

Over the past decades, the development of high performance lightweight polymer nanocomposites and, in particular, of epoxy nanocomposites has become one the greatest challenges in material science. The ultimate goal of epoxy nanocomposites is to extrapolate the <b>exceptional</b> <b>intrinsic</b> properties of the nanoparticles to the bulk matrix. However, {{in spite of the}} efforts, this objective is still to be attained at commercially attractive scales. Key aspects to achieve this are ultimately the full understanding of network structure, the dispersion degree of the nanoparticles, the interfacial adhesion at the phase boundaries and the control of the localization and orientation of the nanoparticles in the epoxy system.

40|$|International audienceThe {{temperature}} dependences of Young's modulus (E) and {{fracture toughness}} (K- 1 c), {{as well as}} the flow behavior, including stress relaxation, creep and superplasticity of several silicon nitride-based materials, monoliths and composites, are reviewed. A transition range between a low softening rate and a higher one, which coincides with the onset of creep ductility, is observed between 1080 and 1150 degreesC on the E(T) curves and is attributed to the behavior of the secondary glassy phases. The higher the Y/Al ratio or the SiC content, the higher the transition temperature. The K- 1 c(T) curves exhibit four different stages which were discussed and interpreted through a theoretical analysis, warning against the frequent confusion between the intrinsic and the apparent (experimentally accessible) toughness. Reliable creep resistant- or inversely superplastic-ceramics are now available. However, the high temperature deformation mechanisms are not well understood yet. Non-Newtonian flow regimes and the pronounced tension/compression flow asymmetry are still intriguing. Today, it can be anticipated that with the development of materials containing low amounts of highly refractory grain boundary phases, ceramists are facing a situation that places them closer to metallurgists, and which should allow them to derive more benefit from the <b>exceptional</b> <b>intrinsic</b> properties of covalent crystals such as Si 3 N 4, Consequently, grains should play a more and more important role on the high temperature mechanical behavior...|$|R
40|$|The {{elimination}} of extrinsic sources of spin relaxation is key in realizing the <b>exceptional</b> <b>intrinsic</b> spin transport performance of graphene. Towards this, we study charge and spin transport in bilayer graphene-based spin valve devices fabricated {{in a new}} device architecture which allows us to make a comparative study by separately investigating the roles of substrate and polymer residues on spin relaxation. First, the comparison between spin valves fabricated on SiO 2 and BN substrates suggests that substrate-related charged impurities, phonons and roughness do not limit the spin transport in current devices. Next, the observation of a 5 -fold enhancement in spin relaxation time in the encapsulated device highlights the significance of polymer residues on spin relaxation. We observe a spin relaxation length of ~ 10 um in the encapsulated bilayer with a charge mobility of 24000 cm 2 /Vs. The carrier density dependence of spin relaxation time has two distinct regimes; n 4 x 1012 cm- 2, where spin relaxation time exhibits a sudden increase. The sudden increase in the spin relaxation time with no corresponding signature in the charge transport suggests {{the presence of a}} magnetic resonance close to the charge neutrality point. We also demonstrate, for the first time, spin transport across bipolar p-n junctions in our dual-gated device architecture that fully integrates a sequence of encapsulated regions in its design. At low temperatures, strong suppression of the spin signal was observed while a transport gap was induced, which is interpreted as a novel manifestation of impedance mismatch within the spin channel...|$|R

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES:Amongst {{the highly}} diverse Escherichia coli population, the ST 131 -O 25 b:H 4 clonal complex is {{particularly}} worrisome {{as it is}} associated {{with a high level of}} antibiotic resistance. The lack of new antibiotics, the worldwide continuous increase of infections caused by MDR bacteria and the need for narrow-spectrum antimicrobial agents have revived interest in phage therapy. In this article, we describe a virulent bacteriophage, LM 33 _P 1, which specifically infects O 25 b strains, and provide data related to its therapeutic potential. METHODS:A large panel of E. coli strains (n =  283) was used to assess both the specificity and the activity of bacteriophage LM 33 _P 1. Immunology, biochemistry and genetics-based methods confirmed this specificity. Virology methods and sequencing were used to characterize this bacteriophage in vitro, while three relevant mouse models were employed to show its in vivo efficacy. RESULTS: Bacteriophage LM 33 _P 1 exclusively infects O 25 b E. coli strains with a 70 % coverage on sequence types associated with high antibiotic resistance (ST 131 and ST 69). This specificity is due to an interaction with the LPS mediated by an original tail fibre. LM 33 _P 1 also has <b>exceptional</b> <b>intrinsic</b> properties with a high adsorption constant and produces over 300 virions per cell in < 10 min. Using animal pneumonia, septicaemia and urinary tract infection models, we showed the in vivo efficacy of LM 33 _P 1 to reduce the bacterial load in several organs. CONCLUSION: Bacteriophage LM 33 _P 1 represents the first weapon that specifically and quickly kills O 25 b E. coli strains. Therapeutic approaches derived from this bacteriophage could be developed to stop or slow down the spread of the ST 131 -O 25 b:H 4 drug-resistant clonal complex in humans...|$|R
40|$|Silk fibroin (SF) is a {{commonly}} available natural biopolymer produced in specialized glands of arthropods, {{with a long}} history of use in textile production and also in health cares. The <b>exceptional</b> <b>intrinsic</b> properties of these fibers, such as self-assembly, machinability, biocompatibility, biodegradation or non-toxicity, offer a wide range of exciting opportunities [1]. It has long been recognized that silk can be a rich source of inspiration for designing new materials with tailored properties, enhanced performance and high added value for targeted applications, opening exciting new prospects in the domain of materials science and related technological fields, including bio-friendly integration, miniaturization and multifunctionalization. In recent years it has been demonstrated that fibroin is an excellent material for active components in optics and photonics devices. Progress in new technological fields such as optics, photonics and electronics are emerging [2, 3]. The incorporation of polymer electrolytes as components of various devices (advanced batteries, smart windows, displays and supercapacitors) offers significant advantages with respect to traditional electrolytes, including enhanced reliability and improved safety. SF films are particularly attractive in this context. They have near-perfect transparency across the VIS range, surface flatness (together with outstanding mechanical robustness), ability to replicate patterned substrates and their thickness may be easily tailored from a few nanometers to hundreds of micrometers through spin-casting of a silk solution into subtract. Moreover, fibroin can be added to other biocomponents or salts in order to modify the biomaterial properties leading to optimized and total different functions. Preliminary tests performed with a prototype electrochromic device (ECD) incorporating SF films doped with lithium triflate and lithium tetrafluoroborate (LiTFSI and LiBF 4, respectively) as electrolyte and WO 3 as cathodic electrochromic layer, are extremely encouraging. Aiming to evaluate the performance of the ion conducting SF membranes doped with LiTFSI and LiBF 4 (SF-Li), small ECDs with glass/ITO/WO 3 /SF-Li/CeO 2 -TiO 2 /ITO/glass configuration were assembled and characterized.

We present the first comparative study of the interfacial properties between ML/BL WSe 2 and Sc, Al, Ag, Au, Pd, and Pt contacts by using ab initio energy band calculations with inclusion of the spin-orbital coupling (SOC) effects and quantum transport simulations. The interlayer coupling tends to reduce both the electron and hole Schottky barrier heights (SBHs) and alters the polarity for WSe 2 -Au contact, while the SOC chiefly reduces the hole SBH. In {{the absence of the}} SOC, Pd contact has the smallest hole SBH with a value no less than 0. 22 eV. Dramatically, Pt contact surpasses Pd contact and becomes p-type Ohmic or quasi-Ohmic contact with inclusion of the SOC.

40|$|Cementitious {{materials}} are commonly and extensively used worldwide by construction industry for {{various types of}} infrastructures. Despite of their exceptional strength in compression they still possess limited tensile strength and tensile strain capacity. Different types of fibers have been investigated since last fifty decades to reinforce the cementitious matrix against tensile failures and to impart ductility. The size of the reinforcing fillers has diminished from macro to micro and now even to the nano scale with the recent advancements in nanotechnology. Due to <b>exceptional</b> <b>intrinsic</b> properties and large aspect ratio, carbon nanotubes have been successfully investigated as a reinforcing filler to modify the mechanical strength, fracture toughness, electrical and electromagnetic wave absorbing properties of cementitious composites. However {{the problems associated with}} its effective dispersion and bonding with the host material limit its widespread applications on large scale. To overcome the aforementioned issues concerning the dispersion and bonding of nano reinforcing materials with the host matrix, graphene nano sheets were explored {{for the first time as}} a reinforcing agent for high performance cementitious matrices. Graphene sheets are free form entanglement problems and therefore need comparatively lesser energy for proper dispersion. Due to very high specific surface area and large aspect ratio in comparison with carbon nanotubes they are much capable to develop strong interfacial bond with the host medium. In the commercialization of these nano carbon particles filled cementitious composites, another major concern would be the related expenses. Therefore in parallel, research work was also done to explore the cost effective alternatives for the production of carbon nano particles to be used for modification or improvement in the properties of cement matrices. In recent wok by Prof. Ferro's research team it has been explored that carbon nano particles produced from coconut shells can be effectively used to improve the mechanical strength and fracture toughness of cementitious composites with limited dispersion issues (G. Ferro et al. 2014, 2015). To continue with the productive research pertaining the cost effective production of carbon nano particles for high performance cementitious composites, bio-waste in the form of bagasse fibers, hazelnut shell and peanut shell was investigated. These particular types of agricultural wastes were selected keeping in view their economic availability as well as the excellent conversion efficiency via pyrolysis. The present work encompasses complete characterization of the investigated materials, detailed study on their dispersion ability in water and the cement matrix, entire mechanical characterization of reinforced cementitious composites at varying proportions as well as their electromagnetic wave absorption properties in 2 - 10 GHz frequency range. It was determined that graphene nano-platelets can be uniformly dispersed in water as well as in the cementitious matrix without any addition of separate dispersant or surfactant or stabilizing agent. It was found that even at a very low content of addition remarkable improvements in the mechanical strength and fracture toughness were attained. The optimum content of addition for the grade 4 graphene nano-platelets was found as 0. 08 wt% providing with a significant increase of 89 % and 29 % in compressive and flexure strength along with 115 % improved fracture toughness. Similarly the carbonized particles produced for bio-waste were found quite effective in modifying the mechanical performance of cementitious composites. Maximum enhancement by 139 % and 88 % in flexural and compressive strength were achieved on 0. 2 wt % addition of nano/micro carbonized particles produced from peanut shell with an increase of 69 % in the fracture toughness as well.

A compreensão profana dos benefícios e das limitações dessas técnicas reflete uma atitude reverencial face à {{medicina}} e ao paradigma racionalista da perspectiva biomédica, ainda que seja possível vislumbrar alguns espaços de autonomia e resistência face às propostas médicas. As eventuais incertezas dessas técnicas são perspectivadas como efeitos excepcionais e intrínsecos à prática da medicina, aos quais têm de se submeter de forma individual.

40|$|Background: Patellar {{tendinopathy}} (PT) is {{a common}} chronic pathology of the knee, with a high prevalence in athletes and the general population. Objectives: The objectives of this article were to systematically investigate all the evidence applicable to the intrinsic and extrinsic causative factors and rehabilitation of PT, and then integrate and link rehabilitation with the main causative factors identified. Method: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed. Various tools were {{used to evaluate the}} methodological quality of the eligible articles. Data were interpreted descriptively, and the causative factors and rehabilitation of PT were analysed. Results: Twenty studies were included in the review. The distinctive factor responsible for PT is the mechanical theory. Seven intrinsic and four extrinsic risk factors were identified, with the main intrinsic risk factors being muscle flexibility and strength, and extrinsic risk factors being acquisition and level of skills. PT can be treated with numerous different therapeutic modalities, although eccentric muscle training showed <b>exceptional</b> results. The <b>intrinsic</b> and extrinsic risk factors can only be transformed and reduced by rehabilitation, which is inevitable to improve PT pain and function.

40|$|The {{reported}} {{prevalence of}} Enterococcus faecalis, both a commensal of the gastro-intestinal tract {{and a common}} nosocomial pathogen, ranges from 24 % to 77 % in post-treatment root canal infections. To date {{it has not been}} possible to explain this prevalence, since its origin remains unknown. Its <b>exceptional</b> array of <b>intrinsic</b> and easily acquired traits, including resistance to a multitude of antibiotics, enables an adaptation {{to a wide variety of}} different environmental settings and poses a challenge in treatments. The aim of the research was to elucidate the origin of E. faecalis in root canal infections to enable a means of preventing costly and time-consuming treatment failures. The potential for acquisition from the endogenous flora, a nosocomial transmission from contaminated surfaces during a root canal procedure and a food-borne route of infection were evaluated by measuring its occurrence on environmental surfaces, comparing genetic relatedness, distribution of putative virulence factors and antibiotic resistance between isolates from different sources. DNA fingerprinting by PFGE concluded that E. faecalis retrieved from eight (16 %) secondary root canal infections in 50 consecutively treated patients were genetically unrelated to those recovered from the patients’ own intestinal tract. E. faecalis could not be retrieved from any of the saliva samples pertaining to the patients with the microorganism in the root canal sample, validating its transient presence in the oral cavity. Analysis of a total of 320 collected samples from 10 high-touch surfaces in six general dentistry clinics and two specialist clinics displayed a very low occurrence (0. 9 %) of E. faecalis on surfaces despite clear deficiencies in decontamination procedures. Determination of the distribution of putative virulence genes and susceptibility to clinically relevant antibiotics amongst strains isolated from root canals, foods, stool and blood culture samples by PCR and the agar dilution method, respectively, detected an association between endodontic isolates and isolates from food and stool based on a common gene pattern, consisting of gelE, efaA and gelE. The linkage could be corroborated by MLST analysis, demonstrating that 66. 7 % of the root canal isolates, 42. 1 % of the food strains, 34. 5 % of the stool isolates but only 10 % of the blood isolates shared genetic lineages. Correlation of detected virulence determinants to MLST data revealed distinctive features of the resulting major genetic lineages. All isolates in CC 25 were impaired to express gelatinase and all strains in CC 6 lacked the gene ace but were enriched with antibiotic resistance and the ability to express cytolysin. In conclusion, E. faecalis in root canal infections is most likely not derived from the endogenous flora or nosocomially transmitted but instead food-borne. It presumably gains access to the treated canals via micro-leakage, which stresses the need for better ways of sealing endodontically treated teeth...|$|R
40|$|Covalent Triazine Frameworks (CTFs) {{are highly}} porous {{materials}} with two- dimensional or three-dimensional architectures, {{which can be}} synthesized with tunable porosity {{and a variety of}} functionalities. Their synthesis and characterization has been studied extensively in many prior works. However, ionic functionalities built into CTFs are new and have not been investigated, especially those containing an imidazolium ring and capable of being deprotonated into an active N-heterocyclic carbene. Chapter 1 introduces different chemical architectures developed by chemists, highlighting one of the most investigated topics being Covalent Organic Frameworks. The theory of absorption of gasses on porous solids is also discussed. Chapter 2 outlines the detailed synthesis and characterization of a unique CTF with Reuleaux Triangle shaped pores, which forms by harnessing the geometry of the N-heterocyclic carbene. Aside from nitrogen uptake, we studied absorption of carbon dioxide on an ionically charged framework. Chapter 3 illustrates a method of exfoliating two-dimensional CTFs. Most CTFs are two dimensionally stacked, which have full conjugation, and π-π stacking similar to that of graphite. Yet, their thin film characteristics have never been studied. Here we developed a method to peel these stacked layers apart, characterize the sheets, and produced thin-film devices along with conductivity measurements. Due to CTFs <b>exceptional</b> stability, and <b>intrinsic</b> nitrogen doping, their electrochemical applications are just beginning to be explored. The electrochemical reduction of oxygen, a very important reaction, {{is one of the main}} limiting factors to widespread use of fuel cells. In Chapter 4 we create oxygen reduction catalysts using super-acid derived CTF polymers and cobalt salts as precursors. The CTF polymers readily absorb cobalt from solution and are then annealed at 900 ï¿½C. The resultant porous catalyst reduces oxygen to water with performance comparable to the industrial standard platinum. Chapter 5 discusses molecular control of porous carbons. We have developed a new pathway by designing molecular precursors to tune the porosity of CTF-derived porous carbon materials. Using CTFs as precursors, while controlling their monomeric length results in a high degree of pore size control. In this process, by choosing using different ratios of long and short monomers we can be tune the size of the CTFs. The resultant framework is heated to desired temperatures of 700 to 900 ï¿½C to yield porous carbon materials. The incremental pore size and volumes from molecular tuning these frameworks remains consistent from both pre annealing to post annealing, though some pore expansions can exist. This is the first demonstration of molecular tuning the pore size of porous carbons, and a powerful way of bringing a certain degree of order to traditionally disordered carbon materials. We apply these characteristics of molecular tuning to investigate capacitive related performance as well as oxygen reduction reaction. Through pore tuning, we create different porous carbons with surface areas ranging from 450 m 2 g- 1 all the way to 2400 m 2 g- 1 while controlling pore sizes within a few nanometers of each other. Capacitive values rise over ten fold from 14 F g- 1 to 180 F g- 1. When different size frameworks are loaded with cobalt and used for oxygen reduction, we observe five-fold increases in kinetic current density, and reach overpotentials of 38 mV less than that of platinum on carbon. These electrocatalysis experiments demonstrate the significance of ample reactant delivery to the catalyst...|$|R
