She buys far more than what is requested in the letter, wanting to see the children's happiness. When Liz delivers the presents to the apartment in the letter, however, the door is answered by two adults who take the gifts, and she believes she has been tricked. Receiving no help from the US Postal Service, who run the charity, she attempts to have it shut down. This upsets Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) who refuses to believe anyone would scam a Christmas charity. She takes Kenneth back to the apartment to prove she was right, but two children answer the door and Liz accidentally reveals to them that Santa Claus <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>real.</b>|$|E

500|$|Although {{nearly all}} users {{understand}} that the Slender Man <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>real,</b> they suspend that disbelief {{in order to become}} more engrossed when telling or listening to stories. This adds a sense of authenticity to Slender Man legend performances and blurs the lines between legend and reality, keeping the creature as an object of legend dialectic. This ambiguity has led some to some confusion over the character's origin and purpose. Only five months after his creation, George Noory's Coast to Coast AM, a radio call-in show devoted to the paranormal and conspiracy theories, began receiving callers asking about the Slender Man. Two years later, an article in the Minneapolis Star Tribune described his origins as [...] "difficult to pinpoint."

A drunken Roy is inspired to announce a date for his wedding with Pam, just before Jim can reach her. Jim is crushed and breaks up with Katy, realizing that he does not want to be with her. He confesses to Michael his feelings for Pam, which surprises Michael, who claims he has a [...] "radar for stuff like that".

In an interview with CBN.com, Abanes remarked that, [...] "One of the easiest ways to know whether a fantasy book or film has real world magick in it is to just ask a simple question, 'Can my child find information in a library or bookstore that {{will enable them to}} replicate what they are seeing in the film or the book?' If you go to The Chronicles of Narnia and The Lord of the Rings what you see in, story magic and imagination, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>real.</b> You can't replicate it.

500|$|The primary {{characters}} in The Other Hand are Little Bee, a Nigerian refugee, and Sarah, a middle-class Englishwoman. Critics {{have focused on}} the contrast between the two, with Caroline Elkins of The New York Times commenting that Sarah might initially appear [...] "insipid" [...] to readers, and that when juxtaposed with Little Bee, she seems [...] "unsympathetic, even tiresome". Tim Teeman of The Times deemed Sarah [...] "batty, bizarre and inconsistent, and despite the tragedy she has suffered, unsympathetic", while writing that in contrast: [...] "Goodness peppers every atom of [...] being." [...] Other reviewers took an opposite stance. Margot Kaminski of the San Francisco Chronicle found Little Bee's characterisation problematic, writing: [...] "Sometimes she's not convincing, and sometimes she tries too hard to convince. It's too often apparent that Little Bee <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>real.</b> This doesn't do justice to her story, and puts the burden back on the author to show that he's representing her, rather than exploiting her." [...] Ed Lake of The Daily Telegraph felt that [...] "Bee's arch reasonableness and implausibly picturesque speech mean she often comes off as a too-cute cipher", and ultimately found Sarah the more convincing character.|$|E
500|$|Fouad Ajami criticised Aflaq {{for a lack}} of real substance, stating, [...] "Nearly {{three hundred}} pages of text yield no insight, on his part, into what went wrong and what needed to be done; there is only the visible infatuation with words" [...] and [...] "Aflaq summons the party to renounce power and go back to its 'pure essence'". There is some truth in this critique. Aflaq spent much time and energy writing optimistically about the future, and the past, of the Arab Nation, and of how the Arab World could be unified. As Kanan Makiya, the author of Republic of Fear: The Politics of Modern Iraq, notes: for [...] "Aflaq, reality is {{confined}} to the inner world of the party." [...] In contrast to other philosophers, such as Karl Marx or John Locke, Aflaq's ideological view of the world makes no clear stand on the materialistic or socioeconomic behavior of humanity. While other philosophers make distinctions between what is real and what <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>real,</b> that is between prescriptive and descriptive analysis, [...] Aflaq did not as a rule define what is and what ought to be. [...] In his thought both are molded into the same category: that which is attainable.|$|E

500|$|Fabulous Histories (later {{known as}} The Story of the Robins), Trimmer's most popular work, was first {{published}} in 1786, and remained in print until the beginning of the 20th century. It tells the story of two families, a robin family and a human family, who learn to live together congenially. Most importantly, the human children and the baby robins must learn to adopt virtue and to shun vice. For Trimmer, practising kindness to animals as a child would hopefully lead one to [...] "universal benevolence" [...] as an adult. According to Samuel Pickering, Jr., a scholar of 18th-century children's literature, [...] "in its depiction of 18th-century attitudes toward animals, Mrs. Trimmer’s Fabulous Histories was the most representative children’s book of the period". [...] The text expresses most of the themes that would come to dominate Trimmer's later works, such as her emphasis on retaining social hierarchies; as Tess Cosslett, a scholar of children's literature explains, [...] "the notion of hierarchy that underpins Fabulous Histories is relatively stable and fixed. Parents are above children in terms of authority, and humans above animals, in terms both of dominion and compassion: poor people should be fed before hungry animals… [...] the hierarchical relation of men and women is not so clearly enforced." [...] Moira Ferguson, a scholar of the 18th and 19th centuries, places these themes in a larger historical context, arguing that [...] "the fears of the author and her class about an industrial revolution in ascendance and its repercussions are evident. Hence, [...] text attacks cruelty to birds and animals while affirming British aggression abroad. [...] …The text subtly opts for conservative solutions: maintenance of order and established values, resignation and compliance from the poor at home, expatriation for foreigners who do not assimilate easily." [...] A second overarching theme in the text is rationality; Trimmer expresses the common fear of the power of fiction in her preface, explaining to her childish readers that her fable <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>real</b> and that animals cannot really speak. Like many social critics during the 18th century, Trimmer was concerned about fiction's potentially damaging impact on young readers. With the rise of the novel and its concomitant private reading, there was a great fear that young people and especially women would read racy and adventurous stories without the knowledge of their parents and, perhaps even more worrisome, interpret the books as they pleased. Trimmer therefore always referred to her text as Fabulous Histories and never as The Story of the Robins in order to emphasize its reality; moreover, she did not allow the book to be illustrated within her lifetime—pictures of talking birds would only have reinforced the paradox of the book (it was fiction parading as a history). Yarde has also speculated that most of the characters in the text are drawn from Trimmer's own acquaintances and family.|$|E
