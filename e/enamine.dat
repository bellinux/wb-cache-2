Its high reactivity reflects {{that it is}} an <b>enamine,</b> which enhances the electron-donating ability of the ring.

25|$|This {{reaction}} {{is known as}} the Hajos-Parrish reaction (also known as the Hajos-Parrish-Eder-Sauer-Wiechert reaction, referring to a contemporaneous report from Schering of the reaction under harsher conditions). Under the Hajos-Parrish conditions only a catalytic amount of proline is necessary (3mol%). There is no danger of an achiral background reaction because the transient <b>enamine</b> intermediates are much more nucleophilic than their parent ketone enols. This strategy offers a simple way of generating enantioselectivity in reactions without using transition metals, which have the possible disadvantages of being toxic or expensive.|$|E

2500|$|Despite their similarities, the two {{functional}} {{groups are}} not identical; {{there are many}} areas where they diverge significantly.

Such species {{can be difficult to}} selectively reduce because they tend to exist in complex equilibria of imine and <b>enamine</b> tautomers, as well as (E) and (Z) isomers. [...] One approach to this problem has been to use ketimines as their hydrochloride salt and rely on the steric properties of the adjacent alkyl or aryl groups to allow the catalyst to differentiate between the two enantiotopic faces of the ketimine.|$|E
2500|$|The 1- and 3-aza-Cope have a bias towards imine {{formation}} {{as opposed}} to <b>enamine</b> formation, as carbon-nitrogen π-bonding is stronger than carbon-nitrogen σ-bonding, meaning the 3-aza-Cope rearrangement is thermodynamically favored, while the 1-aza-Cope rearrangement is not: the imine is nearly 10kcal/mol less in energy.

[...] Research on both the 1 and 3-aza-Cope rearrangements has focused on finding good driving forces to lowering the activation barriers.

40|$|The work in {{this thesis}} mainly deals with l,l-enediamines and ~ -substituted <b>enamines</b> (push-pull olefines) and their reactions, leading to the {{formation}} of a number of heterocycles. Various ~-substituted <b>enamines</b> were prepared by a 'one pot synthesis' in which a l,l-enediamine presumably acts as an intermediate. These <b>enamines,</b> various substituted crotonamides and propenamides, were made by using two different orthoesters, various secondary and primary amines and cyanoacetamide. Their structures, mechanism of formation and geometry are discussed. A synthetic route to various unsymmetrically substituted pyridines was examined. Two substituted pyridinones were obtained by using two different ~-substituted <b>enamines</b> and cyanoacetamide. In one case a dihydropyridine was isolated. This dihydropyridine, on heating in acidic conditions, gave a pyridinone, which confirmed this dihydropyridine as an intermediate in this pyridine synthesis. A new synthetic method was used to make highly substituted pyridinones, which involved the reaction of l,l-enediamines with the ~-substituted <b>enamines.</b> A one pot synthesis and an interrupted one pot synthesis were used to make these pyridinones. Two different orthoesters and three different secondary amines were used. Serendipitous formation of a pyrimidinone was observed when pyrrolidine was used as the secondary amine and triethyl orthopropionate was used as the orthoester. In all cases cyanoacetamide was used as the carbon acid. This pyridine synthesis was designed with aI, l-enediamine as the Michael donor and the ~ -substituted <b>enamines</b> as Michael acceptors.

25|$|Conversely to {{the case}} of olefins, {{asymmetric}} hydrogenation of <b>enamines</b> has favoured diphosphine-type ligands; excellent results have been achieved with both iridium- and rhodium-based systems.
