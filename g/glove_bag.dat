40|$|Seven commercially sourced acetylacetonate salts were {{investigated}} in deep eutectic solvents (DESs that were prepared from ethylene glycol and trifluoroacetamide hydrogen bond donors) by cyclic voltammetry, to identify electrolytes suitable for future applications in {{electrochemical energy storage}} devices. Although the solubilities are low and {{on the order of}} 0. 02 mol·L− 1 for the most soluble salts, some were found to display encouraging quasi-reversible electrochemical kinetics. For instance, the diffusion coefficients of copper(II) acetylacetonate and iron(III) acetylacetonate in the trifluoroacetamide based DES are 1. 14 × 10 − 8 and 5. 12 × 10 − 9 cm 2 ·s− 1, which yields rate constants of 3. 16 × 10 − 3 and 8. 43 × 10 − 6 cm·s− 1, respectively. These results are better than those obtained with the DESs prepared from ethylene glycol. The poor kinetics of the iron(III) acetylacetonate system was possibly due to the hygroscopic nature of the DESs that resulted in a continuous build-up of moisture in the system in spite of the maintenance of an inert atmosphere by means of a plastic <b>glove</b> <b>bag.</b> Further work is thus envisaged in an inert dry box that could lead to H-type glass cell charge/discharge experiments in the future. ...|$|E
40|$|For rate {{determinations}} of {{anaerobic metabolism}} {{it is essential}} to maintain strictly anoxic conditions throughout the experiment. However, even if oxygen contamination can be avoided while preparing the incubation containers, it is still possible that the incubation containers themselves contaminate the samples by oxygen diffusing from or through their plastic or rubber components. In this study, we investigated the sources and extent of oxygen contamination during anoxic incubations, and present solutions to minimize oxygen contamination. In particular, we investigated oxygen contamination in Labco® Exetainers, glass vials with a butyl rubber septum in the screw cap, which are frequently used in microbiological experiments. Our results show that significant oxygen contamination occurred at different stages during the incubation. Contamination occurred when Exetainers were either filled or incubated for more than 16. h under oxic atmosphere, but also under an oxygen-free atmosphere due to diffusion of oxygen out of the butyl rubber septum. Therefore, to avoid oxygen contamination during incubations, we suggest (1) filling and incubating the incubation containers under anoxic atmosphere (<b>glove</b> <b>bag)</b> and (2) deoxygenating all elastomers in sample processing and incubation equipment. If initial oxygen contamination cannot be avoided, introduction of an anoxic headspace might help extract oxygen from the incubated sample and present a buffer against oxygen diffusing out of the septum. We modeled the amount of oxygen diffusing out of butyl rubber septa under different conditions, and results fitted well with the observed oxygen contamination. Thus, the model can be used to predict oxygen contamination under varying conditions and for differently sized septa. © 2011 Elsevier B. V. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Grain {{boundaries}} (GBs), particularly ferrite: ferrite GBs, of X 70 pipeline steel {{were characterized}} using analytical electron microscopy (AEM) {{in order to}} understand its intergranular stress corrosion cracking (IGSCC) mechanism(s). The microstructure consisted of ferrite (alpha), carbides at ferrite GBs, some pearlite and some small precipitates inside the ferrite grains. The precipitates containing Ti, Nb, V and N were identified as complex carbo-nitrides and designated as (Ti, Nb, WC, N). The GB carbides occurred (1) as carbides along ferrite GBs, (2) at triple points, and (3) at triple points and extending along the three ferrite GBs. The GB carbides were Mn rich, were sometimes also Si rich, contained no micro-alloying elements (Ti, Nb, V) and also contained no N. It was not possible to measure the GB carbon concentration due to surface hydrocarbon contamination despite plasma cleaning and <b>glove</b> <b>bag</b> transfer from the plasma cleaner to the electron microscope. Furthermore, there may not be enough X-ray signal from the small amount of carbon at the GBs to enable measurement using AEM. However, the microstructure does indicate that carbon does segregate to alpha : alpha GBs during microstructure development. This is particularly significant in relation to the strong evidence in the literature linking the segregation of carbon at GBs to IGSCC. It was possible to measure all other elements of interest. There was no segregation at alpha : alpha GBs, in particular no S, P and N, and also no segregation of the micro-alloying elements, Ti, Nb and V. (C) 2003 Kluwer Academic Publishers...|$|E

40|$|The <b>glove</b> <b>bag</b> control {{techniques}} used {{to contain the}} emission of asbestos (1332214) fibers during the removal of asbestos containing pipe lagging were evaluated. The data were obtained during week long surveys in each of four public school buildings. Reports detailing the specific conditions and operations observed were generated for each pipe lagging removal site. Exposure measurements determined from personal samples indicated short term exposures as high as 9. 0 fibers/cubic centimeter (f/cc) and time weighted average exposures of 0. 3 f/cc occurring during asbestos removal operations. Airborne asbestos contamination was determined in the work area before and after removal. Aggressive and nonaggressive sampling techniques were used for collecting area samples both before removal and after removal and subsequent cleaning. The results of the analyses indicated that glove bags as used at these four schools did not completely contain the asbestos being removed. In {{three of the four}} facilities workers were exposed to airborne asbestos concentrations above the OSHA permissible exposure limit (2 f/cc {{at the time of this}} study). The authors conclude that the use of glove bags results in unpredictable exposure levels that may present an exposure hazard to workers and contamination of the work site. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 Bruce A.

40|$|Thesis (M. S., Geology) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2014. Stannous-chloride-reducible {{divalent}} mercury, or ???reactive??? mercury (Hg(II) R), is a methodologically defined Hg fraction that {{is increasingly}} {{being used as a}} surrogate measure of the Hg pool available for microbial Hg(II) -methylation. A critical examination of Hg(II) R stability was conducted in a set of experiments that examined techniques of sediment preservation and storage over time (0, 1, 7, 30, 90, 180, and in some cases 360 days), temperature (- 80 ??C, - 15 ??C, and 5 ??C), and with/without a <b>glove</b> <b>bag</b> that excluded atmospheric oxygen. A second set of experiments examined effects of field preservation, sediment homogenization and thaw time associated with samples previously preserved frozen. On the basis of experimental results, a recommended protocol is presented here for studies where Hg(II) R is a targeted analyte. (1) An oxidation-reduction probe should be used in the field to ensure the sampling area has similar redox conditions. (2) Samples may be collected in the field and transported to the lab in one of two ways; in Mason jars with no head space and placed on wet ice or collected in individual vials and placed on dry ice. (3) Based on statistical results, chilled samples should be analyzed immediately (within 1 - 2 days) or stored at - 80 ??C for up to three months and frozen samples should be analyzed immediately (within 1 - 2 days). (4) Prior to analysis, frozen sample may be thawed sample 1 - 4 hours. (5) Compositing samples of variable redox status is not recommended. Sediment for the experiments was chosen from four distinct Hg-contaminated sites surrounding the Sacramento???San Joaquin Delta and San Francisco Bay. Sites were chosen based on legacy Hg contamination in the form of cinnabar (HgS) from past Hg mining impacted sites (Alviso Slough and Cache Creek sites), and elemental Hg from past gold mining sites (Cosumnes River and Humbug Creek (South Yuba River watershed). Samples were chosen {{with a wide range of}} organic content, oxidation-reduction conditions, and total reduced sulfur concentration because these properties are known to influence Hg(II) R concentration. Geochemical modeling conducted with PHREEQC indicated that the oxidation of aqueous sulfide plays an important role in controlling the saturation index of cinnabar, which has a direct effect on the solubility of Hg(II), and by extension an influence on the sediment Hg(II) R assay.

40|$|Accepted: February 10, 2015 A newly {{developed}} method for determining fatty acid status in samples of whole blood using collection papers was evaluated. Fresh blood was analyzed {{either directly or}} after being applied to a strip of blood collection paper. When compared with fresh blood, spotted blood samples exhibited {{a higher percentage of}} saturated fatty acids and lower percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially when the volume of blood spot was low, suggesting the presence of contaminants in the paper. This was confirmed by gas chromatography analysis of blank collection papers which produced peaks which corresponded with saturated fatty acids. Further studies revealed that latex <b>gloves,</b> aluminium <b>bags</b> and polyethylene bags also have the potential to contaminate blood spot samples during sample collection, processing, and storage. The choice of collection paper, <b>gloves,</b> and storage <b>bags</b> which contain the minimum amount of contaminants is therefore essential to reduce the impact of external contaminants on the blood spot fatty acid analysis results. Practical applications: This research shows that the choice of collection paper, <b>gloves,</b> and storage <b>bags</b> which contain the minimum amount of contaminants is essential to reduce the impact of external contaminants on the blood spot fatty acid analysis results. Moreover, this work shows the potential of using Whatman ion exchange paper in clinical trials that are aimed at measuring the fatty acids composition in dried blood spots, to provide more accurate results.
