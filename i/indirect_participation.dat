The research questions are: (1) which forms of direct and <b>indirect</b> employee <b>participation</b> can we distinguish?; (2) {{to what extent do}} forms of direct and <b>indirect</b> employee <b>participation</b> coincide within organisations?; and (3) to what extent are forms of direct and <b>indirect</b> employee <b>participation</b> associated with (a) workplace wellbeing and (b) the (economic) performance of the organisation? Using the ECS- 2013 we analyse data from 24, 251 establishments in the 28 EU Member States. Latent class analyses distinguished four types of <b>indirect</b> employee <b>participation</b> and five types of direct employee participation that vary in the extent to which participation is being facilitated. We found little support for the hypothesis that direct employee participation is deployed to replace indirect employee participation: establishments most commonly combine direct and indirect forms of employee participation.

5000|$|The {{total value}} of equity-backed {{securities}} in the United States rose over 600% in the 25 years between 1989 and 2012 as market capitalization expanded from $2,790 billion to $18,668 billion. Direct ownership of stock by individuals rose slightly from 17.8% in 1992 to 17.9% in 2007, with the median value of these holdings rising from $14,778 to $17,000. <b>Indirect</b> <b>participation</b> {{in the form of}} retirement accounts rose from 39.3% in 1992 to 52.6% in 2007, with the median value of these accounts more than doubling from $22,000 to $45,000 in that time. [...] Rydqvist, Spizman, and Strebulaev attribute the differential growth in direct and indirect holdings to differences in the way each are taxed in the United States. Investments in pension funds and 401ks, the two most common vehicles of <b>indirect</b> <b>participation,</b> are taxed only when funds are withdrawn from the accounts. Conversely, the money used to directly purchase stock is subject to taxation as are any dividends or capital gains they generate for the holder. In this way the current tax code incentivizes individuals to invest indirectly.|$|E

40|$|Indirect perpetration The {{concept of}} {{indirect}} perpetration applies when a deliberate crime is committed through a person {{which is not}} liable under criminal law for the act (by so-called "live instrument" or "innocent agent"). Such a person may however {{be held liable for}} another offense, but not for a deliberate crime for which she had been used. In order for an activity to be regarded as an indirect perpetration, the direct perpetrator must have a "dual intent": to commit an offense and that the innocent agent be not criminally liable. The legislation provides the following examples of indirect perpetration: use of a person not criminally liable for the lack of age or insanity, a person acting under a mistake or in self-defense, extreme emergency or other circumstances precluding unlawfulness or a person which did not act or did not unlawfully culpably, or a person which did not with a special intention or and intention presumed by the law. Indirect perpetration is in many cases similar to participation in crime (accessority), especially to counseling.

40|$|In Western Europe, works councils are {{a common}} form of <b>indirect</b> {{employee}} <b>participation</b> in management decision making. Trust is often assumed {{to play an important}} role in the nature and outcomes of labour negotiations and in management-works council consultations. So far, however, the antecedents of trust in management within works councils have not been studied. Using longitudinal data collected among the members of 75 Dutch works councils, the current study tests predictions regarding the relative influence of instrumental vs relational antecedents on the level of trust in management among works council members. An important role of instrumental predictors (eg. perceived influence of the works council on management decision making) supports a view of trust as a calculative phenomenon. On the other hand, strong effects of relational predictors would lend support to trust as a relational phenomenon. The data show that trust in management among works council members is related to relational rather than instrumental antecedents...|$|R

This indirect form of government participation is effective in 'linking' fees with utilization during negotiations, avoiding inflationary trends inherent in fee-for-service systems. This target-setting factor is a necessary complement to negotiation of a 'pool' of money, wage level and technological adjustment factors, as contained in a model of German economic health care policy.
