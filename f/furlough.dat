5|$|In July 2010, Beshear {{announced}} six mandatory, unpaid <b>furlough</b> {{days for}} most state employees {{in order to}} achieve the savings called for by the budget. Later in the month, Beshear announced exceptions from the <b>furlough</b> for public safety and mental health care workers. The American Federation of County State and Municipal Employees (AFCSME) Council 62, which represents about 9,000 of Kentucky's state workers, filed suit to block implementation of the furloughs. A Franklin County Circuit Court Judge refused to issue an injunction in September 2010, but allowed the lawsuit to proceed. A month later, AFCSME agreed to drop the suit and address the <b>furlough</b> issue through Beshear's Employee Advisory Council. Ultimately, all six <b>furlough</b> days were observed as outlined in Beshear's plan.|$|E

Bronco undergraduate research program. Under then-president J. Michael Ortiz, Cal Poly Pomona launched its first comprehensive capital campaign in fall of 2008 to increase its permanent endowment. Nevertheless, the negative economic effects caused by the late-2000s recession has increased student fees, reduced enrollment availability, eliminated two athletic programs and introduced a mandatory <b>furlough</b> calendar for most of its 47,000 employees.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. P. P. A., Public Policy and Administration) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2012. The recent mandatory, unpaid California state <b>furloughs</b> were unprecedented, yet we {{know little}} about how state workers {{themselves}} reacted to this major change in working conditions. This thesis set out to obtain this information, and to assess four hypotheses: 1) Most employees viewed the <b>furloughs</b> unfavorably due to the financial hardship they created; 2) Some employees viewed the <b>furloughs</b> favorably due to their benefits, which include more time for family, and childcare cost savings; 3) Most eligible employees volunteered to work over-time, {{and those who did}} not lived in dual-income households; 4) Employees who were eligible to retire within the next five years considered doing so sooner as a result of the <b>furloughs.</b> To complete this thesis, I distributed a survey to about 173 employees at the Sacramento Disability Determination Services Division, in November 2010. I developed the survey after completing a literature review on employee motivation in the public sector, desired employee work hours, and popular news articles on the <b>furloughs.</b> Based on the survey findings, frequency distribution reports, and statistical analyses, I was able to confirm the first hypothesis, partially confirm the second and third hypotheses, and was unable to confirm the fourth hypothesis. Notably, I discovered that there was a higher than expected rate of 19 percent of respondents who found the <b>furloughs</b> to be beneficial. Also, despite the hardship brought on by the <b>furloughs,</b> the majority of DDSD employees reported a high rate of job satisfaction and job meaningfulness. I confirmed that nearly half of respondents had state careers of five years or less, 44 percent were under the age of forty, and nearly 75 percent had college degrees. Finally, I considered implications of the findings for executives in state public service and suggestions for further research. Public Policy and Administratio...|$|R

5|$|On February 3, Davy Crockett {{appeared}} with thirtyTennesseans. Neill went on <b>furlough</b> on February 11 {{to visit his}} sick family, leaving Travis, {{a member of the}} regular army, in command. Bowie was older than Travis with a better reputation and considered himself a colonel, thus outranking Travis, a lieutenant colonel. He refused to answer to Travis, who called an election for the men to choose their own commander. They chose Bowie, infuriating Travis. Bowie celebrated his appointment by getting very drunk and causing havoc in San Antonio, releasing all prisoners in the local jails and harassing citizens. Travis was disgusted, but twodays later the men agreed to a joint command; Bowie would command the volunteers, and Travis would command the regular army and the volunteer cavalry.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Ross began a 90-day <b>furlough</b> on March 13, 1865, he {{had participated in}} 135 engagements with the enemy and his horse had been shot {{out from under him}} five times, yet he had escaped serious injury. With his leave approved, Ross hurried home to Texas to visit the wife he had not seen in two years. While at home, the Confederate Army began its surrender. He had not rejoined his {{regiment}} when it surrendered in Jackson, Mississippi, on May 14, 1865. Because he was not present at the surrender, Ross did not receive a parole protecting him from arrest. As a Confederate Army officer over the rank of colonel, Ross was also exempted from President Andrew Johnson's amnesty proclamation of May 29, 1865. To prevent his arrest and the confiscation of his property, on August 4, 1865, Ross applied for a special pardon for his treason against the United States. Johnson personally approved Ross's application on October 22, 1866, but Ross did not receive and formally accept the pardon until July 1867.|$|E
5|$|In 1837, Augustus {{attempted}} {{to obtain an}} appointment for James to the United States Military Academy, but the vacancy for his congressional district had already been filled so James was appointed in 1838 by a relative, Reuben Chapman, who represented the First District of Alabama (where Mary Longstreet lived). James was a poor student academically and a disciplinary problem at West Point, ranking 54th out of 56 cadets when he graduated in 1842. He was popular with his classmates, however, and befriended a number of men who would become prominent during the Civil War, including George Henry Thomas, William S. Rosecrans (his West Point roommate), John Pope, D. H. Hill, Lafayette McLaws, George Pickett, and Ulysses S. Grant, who was of the Class of 1843. Longstreet was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant. After a brief <b>furlough,</b> {{he set out to}} join the 4th U.S. Infantry at Jefferson Barracks, Missouri. Longstreet spent his first two years of service at the post, which was under the command of Lt. Col. John Garland. In 1843, he was joined by his friend, Lieutenant Ulysses Grant.|$|E

5|$|In March 1777, Scott {{returned}} to his Virginia farm, taking his first <b>furlough</b> {{in more than a}} year. In recognition of his service with Washington, Congress commissioned him a brigadier general on April 2, 1777. At Washington's request, he {{returned to}} Trenton on May 10, 1777. His 4th Virginia Brigade and another brigade under William Woodford constituted the Virginia division, commanded by Adam Stephen, who had been promoted to major general. With Stephen and Brigadier General William Maxwell ill, Scott assumed temporary command of the division between May 19 and 24. Washington spent much of the summer of 1777 trying to anticipate and counter the moves of British General William Howe, and the lull in the fighting allowed Scott time to file a protest with Congress regarding how his seniority and rank had been calculated. After eight months of deliberation, Congress concurred with Scott's protest, placing him ahead of fellow brigadier general George Weedon in seniority.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur {{spent his}} {{graduation}} <b>furlough</b> {{with his parents}} at Fort Mason, California, where his father, now a major general, was serving as commander of the Department of the Pacific. Afterward, he joined the 3rd Engineer Battalion, which departed for the Philippines in October 1903. MacArthur was sent to Iloilo, where he supervised {{the construction of a}} wharf at Camp Jossman. He went on to conduct surveys at Tacloban City, Calbayog City and Cebu City. In November 1903, while working on Guimaras, he was ambushed by a pair of Filipino brigands or guerrillas; he shot and killed both with his pistol. He was promoted to first lieutenant in Manila in April 1904. In October 1904, his tour of duty was cut short when he contracted malaria and dhobi itch during a survey on Bataan. He returned to San Francisco, where he was assigned to the California Debris Commission. In July 1905, he became chief engineer of the Division of the Pacific.|$|E

McCreary was taken to Ninth Street Prison in Cincinnati, Ohio, but was later transferred to Fort Delaware and eventually to Morris Island, South Carolina, where he remained a prisoner through July and most of August 1863. In late August, he was released as part of a prisoner exchange and taken to Richmond, Virginia. He was granted a thirty-day <b>furlough</b> before being put in command of a battalion of Kentucky and South Carolina troops.

5|$|Stationed in Alabama at {{the time}} of Hendrix's birth, Al was denied the {{standard}} military <b>furlough</b> afforded servicemen for childbirth; his commanding officer placed him in the stockade to prevent him from going AWOL to see his infant son in Seattle.

When Al was away, Hendrix was mostly cared for by family members and friends, especially Lucille's sister Delores Hall and her friend Dorothy Harding. Al received an honorable discharge from the U.S. Army on September 1, 1945. Two months later, unable to find Lucille, Al went to the Berkeley, California, home of a family friend named Mrs. Champ, who had taken care of and had attempted to adopt Hendrix; this is where Al saw his son for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Stewart {{commanded}} the brigade {{through the early}} stages of the Italian Campaign before handing over responsibility to Brigadier Howard Kippenberger in November 1943. Stewart then took over command of the 4th Armoured Brigade while its nominal commander, Brigadier Lindsay Inglis, was on <b>furlough</b> in New Zealand. When Kippenberger became temporary commander of the 2nd New Zealand Division, Stewart returned to the 5th Infantry Brigade as its commander. He led the brigade through the Battle of Monte Cassino and up until early August 1944, when he was captured by German forces while visiting the front line. He was held in Germany as a prisoner of war until March 1945, when his camp was liberated by Allied Forces. He was mentioned in despatches twice during the course of the war as well as being awarded the United States Legion of Merit and the Greek Military Cross.|$|E
5|$|The Whitman {{family had}} a {{difficult}} end to 1864. On September 30, 1864, Whitman's brother George was captured by Confederates in Virginia, and another brother, Andrew Jackson, died of tuberculosis compounded by alcoholism on December 3. That month, Whitman committed his brother Jesse to the Kings County Lunatic Asylum. Whitman's spirits were raised, however, when he finally got a better-paying government post as a low-grade clerk in the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the Department of the Interior, thanks to his friend William Douglas O'Connor. O'Connor, a poet, daguerreotypist and an editor at The Saturday Evening Post, had written to William Tod Otto, Assistant Secretary of the Interior, on Whitman's behalf. Whitman began the new appointment on January 24, 1865, with a yearly salary of $1,200. A month later, on February 24, 1865, George was released from capture and granted a <b>furlough</b> because of his poor health. By May 1, Whitman received a promotion to a slightly higher clerkship and published Drum-Taps.|$|E
