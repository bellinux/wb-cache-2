5|$|Related to weapon {{dances and}} war dances is {{the dance of}} the hunt. A very early {{reference}} to a weapon dance of the hunt {{comes in the form}} of a rock engraving at Çatal Höyük, the large neolithic settlement in south-central Anatolia. It depicts a hunting ritual involving dancers holding their bows; one figure has a bow in each hand, two perform artistic leaps and another holds a horn-shaped stick and <b>is</b> <b>striking</b> a frame drum.|$|E
25|$|The {{similarity}} between linear mechanical components, such as springs and dashpots (viscous-fluid dampers), and electrical components, such as capacitors, inductors, and resistors <b>is</b> <b>striking</b> {{in terms of}} mathematics. They can be modeled using equations of the same form.|$|E
25|$|His art <b>is</b> <b>striking</b> {{but also}} introspective. He often {{captured}} figures engrossed {{in their own}} worlds. Many of his photographs were taken spontaneously, without the subject's notice. Although he used many mediums, his pieces are consistently thoughtful and playful.|$|E

25|$|The {{adjacent}} St Marys Church of Ireland Church {{was built}} in 1862 to a design by the architect Joseph Welland (1798–1860) and features a stained glass window from the studio of Harry Clarke.

25|$|NB: Evidence {{from the}} Slavic {{language}} group {{suggests that it}} may be worth revisiting this line of thought: compare Polish wiedźma (witch) / wiedzieć (to know) – the parts of these words highlighted in bold are pronounced the same i.e., roughly vee-edge. The aural similarity to “witch” <b>is</b> <b>striking.</b>|$|E
25|$|What <b>is</b> <b>striking</b> {{about these}} {{passages}} is his intellectual rigour, which put him {{far ahead of}} the mercantilist writers of earlier in the century. It is also interesting to note the use of biological analogies to illustrate his point, a trend continued by the physiocrats in France early in the 18th century.|$|E

25|$|Almost {{all of the}} {{photographs}} are printed very darkly so the sky often appears black or nearly black. The contrast between {{the sky and the}} much lighter clouds <b>is</b> <b>striking</b> in all {{but a few of the}} prints. Some images include the sun either as a distinct element in the photograph or as an illuminating force behind the clouds.|$|E
25|$|A {{geometric}} reformulation is as follows. Let X be a connected affine {{scheme of}} finite type over a field K (for example, an affine variety). Let n be {{the dimension of}} X. By Noether normalization, there is a finite morphism f from X to affine space A'n over K. Then X is Cohen–Macaulay if and only all fibers of f have the same degree. It <b>is</b> <b>striking</b> that this property is independent of the choice of f.|$|E
25|$|The Libro del Caballero et del escudero was {{finished}} {{before the end}} of 1326. It <b>is</b> <b>striking</b> for its curious and varied erudition of the turbulent prince who weaves his personal experiences with historical or legendary incidents, with reminiscences of Aesop and Phaedrus, with the Disciplina clericalis, with Kalilah and Dimnah, with various Oriental traditions, and with the material of anecdotic literature which he embodies in the Libro de patronio, best known by the title of El Conde Lucanor.|$|E

25|$|Neolithic {{communities}} seem to {{have preferred}} Norfolk's light soils and well-drained river valley tracts, rather than the heavily wooded central claylands, although these were probably occupied to some extent and also exploited for hunting and foraging. Excavation {{results indicate that the}} woodland was dominated by oak and pine, see Broome Heath and Colney. The fertile Rich Loam region of north and east Norfolk, with its loess-rich soils, may have been especially congenial, and the number of possible monuments here <b>is</b> <b>striking.</b>|$|E
25|$|Yet it <b>is</b> <b>striking</b> {{that the}} image of women {{projected}} by women's literature of the 1930s is clearly contrary to traditional views of sweet housewife spread by Rosenberg and Goebbels. The heroines of women's novels during this period are often a strong and tenacious type of woman, while the sons and husbands are quickly delivered to death. Everything happens as if one perceives through these fictions a true antagonism between the sexes generated by the constant mobilisation of these two groups independent of one another.|$|E
25|$|The {{bilateral}} symmetry inherent in Two Nudes in an Exotic Landscape <b>is</b> <b>striking</b> (even if {{only as an}} approximation). The proto-Cubist geometry is solidly constructed but the equilibrium is unstable or short-lived. Each tile of pigment juxtaposed one next to the other form {{a section of the}} painting: each section of the painting containing between 10 of 50 'tiles' dominated by blues, reds, and greens. There is no smooth transition between each section. The painting is divided, fragmented, splintered or faceted into series, not only of individual rectangles, squares or 'cubes' of color, but into individual planes or surfaces delineated by color and form, already pointing towards Cubism.|$|E

25|$|Lebanon cedar {{was used}} for the poles and beams of the Umm el-Qa'ab tombs and had already been {{imported}} earlier; pigment residues hinted at bright colors. The wood planks were painted yellow on their outside and traces of white pigment have also been found. “A part of the mud brick casing suggests that there could have been a support for poles/pennants on top of the boats, as in the boats depicted on pottery or atop the archaic shrines onto some mace heads/palettes and in the HK loc. 29A cultural center.” This technology for ship construction persisted in Egypt for more than one thousand years and the standardization of this earliest phase of plank boat construction in Egypt <b>is</b> <b>striking.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bomber and Coastal Command {{attacks against}} {{invasion}} barge concentrations in Channel ports were widely {{reported by the}} British media during September and October 1940. In {{what became known as}} 'the Battle of the Barges' RAF attacks were claimed in British propaganda to have sunk large numbers of barges, and to have created widespread chaos and disruption to German invasion preparations. Given the volume of British propaganda interest in these bomber attacks during September and earlier October, it <b>is</b> <b>striking</b> how quickly this was overlooked once the Battle of Britain had been concluded. Even by mid-war the bomber pilots' efforts had been largely eclipsed by a continuing focus on the Few, this a result of the Air Ministry's continuing valorisation of the ″fighter boys″, beginning with the March 1941 Battle of Britain propaganda pamphlet.|$|E
25|$|From {{the second}} instar on, the spiderlings have a brownish-gray cephaIothorax and limbs, {{and a red}} abdomen with {{markings}} limited to the posterior portion. These consist {{of a pair of}} black stripes, each bearing two conspicuous white dots, separated by a light region. The light region may be gray, white, or even golden; immediately anterior to the black stripes it is enlarged into a conspicuous light dot. While the abdomen of very young spiderlings appears bronze, the red color of the abdomen <b>is</b> <b>striking</b> in later instars. In one of the later instars, the 5th or perhaps the 6th, a red cap appears in the eye region, but this marking disappears in the following molt. The light basal band and side bands of the adult are also present in immature spiders, and, in the two instars proceeding maturity, the chelicerae are also iridescent.|$|E

25|$|A new {{inspiration}} {{entered her}} life in 1897 when her husband received a teaching position in Japan as an English professor at the Keiogijku University. Lilla Perry met Okakura Kakuzō, one of the Imperial Art School co-founders. For three years Perry resided in Japan and took full advantage of its unique artistic community. In October 1898 Perry exhibited her work in Tokyo, {{with the assistance of}} Kakuzo, and became an honorary member of the Nippon Bijutsu-In Art Association. Perry’s involvement with the Asian art world greatly influenced her work and made it possible for her to develop a unique style that brought together western and eastern aesthetic traditions. Her Meditation, Child in a Kimono and Young Girl with an Orange vibrantly illustrates the distinct changes that occurred in Perry’s work during her stay in Japan. Unlike her earlier works, both compositions draw on uniquely eastern subject matter and show a strong influence of the clean lines from Japanese prints. The result of this blending of east and west <b>is</b> <b>striking</b> with Impressionist portraits flowing seamlessly with the well-organized, balanced compositions that the eastern art world was known for at this time. Mount Fuji became the subject of 35 or more paintings and she made a total of more than 80 paintings while in Japan.|$|E
25|$|Hatra in contrast, had {{numerous}} stone statues representing deities or local rulers {{and their family}} members. The local upper class donated the statues of the temples to the city, where they were found by the excavations. Many of these works are precisely dated by inscriptions of the donor and provide a good chronological framework. There is also sometimes even the mention of a sculptor's name, such as Aba or Schabaz. In addition to works in the classical Greco-Hellenistic tradition (especially of classical deities) they show the people sitting or standing, facing front and dressed in Parthian fashion with rich regalia. The men wear shoes, pants and a tunic over it. Over the tunic some men wear a kind of jacket. Often you can see {{on the left side}} a dagger, a sword on his right hip. Kings wear a tiara with a diadem or tiara with the image of an eagle. The right hand is usually raised in a gesture of adoration to the top, the left hand holds a sword or a palm branch. Other statues carry in both hands a statue of God. There <b>is</b> <b>striking</b> attention to detail. The patterns of the substances, weapons and jewelry are reproduced exactly.|$|E
25|$|Although most {{research}} has been conducted on adults, children can be bystanders too. A study conducted by Robert Thornberg in 2007 came up with seven reasons why children do not help when another classmate is in distress. These include: trivialisation, dissociation, embarrassment association, busy working priority, compliance with a competitive norm, audience modelling, and responsibility transfer. In a further study, Thornberg concluded that there are seven stages of moral deliberation as a bystander in bystander situations among the Swedish schoolchildren he observed and interviewed: (a) noticing that something is wrong, i.e., children pay selective attention to their environment, and sometimes they don't tune in on a distressed peer if they're in a hurry or their view is obstructed, (b) interpreting a need for help—sometimes children think others are just playing rather than actually in distress or they display pluralistic ignorance, (c) feeling empathy, i.e., having tuned in on a situation and concluded that help is needed, children might feel sorry for an injured peer, or angry about unwarranted aggression (empathic anger), (d) processing the school's moral frames—Thornberg identified five contextual ingredients influencing children's behavior in bystander situations (the definition of a good student, tribe caring, gender stereotypes, and social-hierarchy-dependent morality), (e) scanning for social status and relations, i.e., students were less likely to intervene if they didn't define themselves as friends of the victim or belonging to the same significant social category as the victim, or if there were high-status students present or involved as aggressors—conversely, lower-status children were more likely to intervene if only a few other low-status children were around, (f) condensing motives for action, such as considering a number of factors such as possible benefits and costs, and (g) acting, i.e., all of the above coalesced into a decision to intervene or not. It <b>is</b> <b>striking</b> how this was less an individual decision than the product of a set of interpersonal and institutional processes.|$|E
