50|$|EiPT {{is short}} for N-ethyl-N-isopropyl-tryptamine. The full {{chemical}} name of this structure is N-ethyl-N-2-(1H-indol-3-yl)ethylpropan-2-amine. EiPT is a tryptamine, which all belong to a larger family of compounds known as indolethylamines. EiPT {{is closely related to}} the compounds <b>diethyltryptamine</b> (DET) and DIPT.|$|E
5000|$|United States v. Forbes, 806 F. Supp. 232 (D. Colo. 1992), a Colorado {{district}} court case, considered {{the question of}} whether the drug alphaethyltryptamine (AET) was a controlled substance analogue in the USA. The controlled drugs to which it was alleged that AET was substantially similar were the tryptamine analogues dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and <b>diethyltryptamine</b> (DET). [...] AET ...|$|E
40|$|N-N {{dimethyltryptamine}} (DMT) the tryptamine derivatives {{have been}} arousing increased interest. A {{team of the}} above Institute {{was the first to}} test DMT and N-N <b>diethyltryptamine</b> (DET) in man. These compounds were synthesized by SzÃ¡ra, by the method of Speeter and Anthony. DET was then synthesized again and analysed pharmacologically by Borsi and LÃ©nÃ¡rt. Our aim was to elucidate the eventual toxic or psychotropic effects of the single metabolites of tryptophane in order to gain possible insight into the genesis of the metabolic disturbance in schizophrenia. In contrast with the so-called plantagenic psychomimetics (LSD, mescaline, etc.), the tryptamine derivatives seem to belong to the â€œ¿somatogenicâ€•group, which may be formed under special conditions also in the animal organism (de Boor). Thus far, bufotenine is the best known one among these compounds. This agent is hallucinogenic, occurs widely in nature and, according to Fabing, may be formed also in man as a result of abnormal serotonin breakdown. The intestinal bacteria may give rise to tryptamine formation from tryptophan...|$|E
