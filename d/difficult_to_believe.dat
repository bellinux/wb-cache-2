5|$|Before, Beyoncé's {{approach}} to heartbreak was always literal, {{her voice and}} her words declaiming her feelings with a studied earnestness that at times was <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe,</b> let alone connect with. 'Irreplaceable' is the first song in which Beyoncé lies to herself, and the way her voice perfectly betrays that lie (revealing a giveaway tremble in the stiff upper lip of the lyrics) simultaneously renders it her most sophisticated and her most honest performance to date.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Tess was {{originally intended to}} be featured as the main antagonist of The Last of Us, pursuing Joel for a year before a final confrontation in which she is killed by Ellie. However, the team found it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that Tess would dispute with Joel and pursue him for a year; this was solved by significantly adjusting the story. Actress Annie Wersching {{was impressed by the}} script, and Druckmann's ability to write unique female characters. When writing the game's female characters, particularly Tess and Ellie, Druckmann avoided external influences, such as the media's portrayal of women, as he wished to write his own story.|$|E

5|$|In 1804, Clarkson {{resumed his}} work and the Society for Effecting the Abolition of the Slave Trade began meeting again, {{strengthened}} with prominent new members such as Zachary Macaulay, Henry Brougham and James Stephen. In June 1804, Wilberforce's bill to abolish the slave trade successfully passed all its stages through the House of Commons. However, {{it was too late}} in the parliamentary session for it to complete its passage through the House of Lords. On its reintroduction during the 1805 session, it was defeated, with even the usually sympathetic Pitt failing to support it. On this occasion and throughout the campaign, abolition was held back by Wilberforce's trusting, even credulous nature, and his deferential attitude towards those in power. He found it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that men of rank would not do what he perceived to be the right thing, and was reluctant to confront them when they did not.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Joel and Ellie {{was the central}} focus of the game; all other elements were developed around it. Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson were cast as Joel and Ellie, respectively, and provided voice and motion capture performances. Baker and Johnson contributed {{to the development of}} the characters; for example, Baker convinced Druckmann that Joel would care for Tess due to his loneliness, and Johnson convinced Druckmann that Ellie should be stronger and more defensive. Ellie's physical appearance was also redesigned throughout development to make her look more similar to Johnson. The game's other characters also underwent changes. The character Tess was originally intended to be the main antagonist of The Last of Us, but the team found it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> her motives. The sexuality of the character Bill was originally left vague in the script, but later altered to further reflect his homosexuality.|$|E

Smith eventually acquiesces and discusses what transpired.|$|E

25|$|The {{frontage}}: The Jain temple has a fine frontage of carved stone, carved so profusely in such delicate airy tracery {{that it is}} <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> it is stone.

60|$|Yet it was {{impossible}} to him to satisfy them; and with bitter distress he saw now that it {{was impossible}} for him any longer to resist the prosecution of the trial in Fra Domenico's case. Not that Savonarola had uttered and written a falsity when he declared his belief in a future supernatural attestation of his work; but his mind was so constituted that while it was easy for him <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> in a miracle which, being distant and undefined, was screened behind the strong reasons he saw for its occurrence, and yet easier for him to have a belief in inward miracles such as his own prophetic inspiration and divinely-wrought intuitions; it was at the same time insurmountably <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> him <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> in the probability of a miracle which, like this of being carried unhurt through the fire, pressed in all its details on his imagination and involved a demand not only for belief but for exceptional action.|$|R
25|$|The main {{trouble with}} Kurzman's {{interesting}} {{book is the}} author's credulity; he uncritically accepts the validity of controversial documents and unquestioningly believes in the statements made {{to him by his}} principal German interlocutor, the former SS General Karl Wolff, who died in 1984. The book's documentation is modest; the short notes and index contain a great number of vague or inaccurate references. Moreover, it is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> the arguments of an author who so manifestly lacks the language abilities needed for his work. Kurzman seems to know Italian but no German; he misspells German names and uses almost no German-language sources.|$|E
25|$|During 1992–93, {{his first}} season at Ajax, he played mostly in the reserves. The Ajax manager Louis van Gaal was {{apparently}} not overly impressed with him, but the team physiotherapist suggested using him as a stand-in for Dennis Bergkamp, who was injured at the time. Van Gaal liked what he saw, and knowing that Bergkamp {{was about to leave}} for Internazionale, he announced that Litmanen would be Bergkamp's successor, something that people in Litmanen's native Finland found <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe.</b> This turned out to be true, however, and he inherited from Bergkamp the famous number 10 shirt, which is often given to playmakers. He went on to score 26 goals in the 1993–94 season, becoming the league's top scorer, and leading Ajax to the title. He was also voted Footballer of the Year in the Netherlands in 1993.|$|E

500|$|This line of {{reasoning}} is consistent with interpretations of Bosch's other major moralising works which hold up the folly of man; the Death of the Miser and the Haywain.

[...] Bosing concluded however that a medieval mindset was naturally suspicious of material beauty, in any form, and that the sumptuousness of Bosch's description may have been intended to convey a false paradise, teeming with transient beauty.|$|E

500|$|From {{the mid-1950s}} rumours began to {{circulate}} that Blyton had not written {{all the books}} attributed to her, a charge she found particularly distressing. She published an appeal in her magazine asking children {{to let her know}} if they heard such stories and, after one mother informed her that she had attended a parents' meeting at her daughter's school during which a young librarian had repeated the allegation, Blyton decided in 1955 to begin legal proceedings. The librarian was eventually forced to make a public apology in open court early the following year, but the rumours that Blyton operated [...] "a 'company' of ghost writers" [...] persisted, as some found it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that one woman working alone could produce such a volume of work.|$|E
500|$|When {{designing}} the physical appearance of Tess, the team aimed {{to make her}} look [...] "tough and capable", striving to add an element of strength {{in order to show}} that she might be more ruthless than Joel.
