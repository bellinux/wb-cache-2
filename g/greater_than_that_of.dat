5|$|Analyzing deep-infrared images {{obtained}} by the Spitzer Space Telescope and Gemini North telescope, astronomers discovered {{that one of the}} cluster's stars – HD 23514, which has a mass and luminosity a bit <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the Sun, is surrounded by an extraordinary number of hot dust particles. This could be evidence for planet formation around HD 23514.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} in the mathematical derivation below, the X-ray scattering {{is determined by the}} density of electrons within the crystal. Since the energy of an X-ray is much <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> a valence electron, the scattering may be modeled as Thomson scattering, the interaction of an electromagnetic ray with a free electron. This model is generally adopted to describe the polarization of the scattered radiation.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 17th century and early 18th century, while Monaco was officially an {{independent}} state, {{it was in}} reality a province of France. Its rulers spent {{much of their time}} at the French court, in this way resembling the absentee landlords so prevalent at the time amongst the French aristocracy. The lure of Versailles was <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> their own country.|$|E

50|$|Arruntius had {{an adopted}} son, Lucius Arruntius Camillus Scribonianus who was {{appointed}} governor of Dalmatia in about 40 AD and attempted to revolt against Claudius in 41 AD. This suggests that Arruntius may have nurtured revolutionary ideas in his son.He also had an adopted grandson called Lucius Arruntius Camillus Scribonianus who was apparently more proud of his descent from Pompey The <b>Great</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Arruntius.|$|R

5|$|National {{consistency}} of governance. In 1978 the Northern Territory achieved self-government. The ACT {{was the only}} other mainland territory, with a population <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the Northern Territory that was growing faster, so it was suggested that if self-government was appropriate for the Northern Territory, then it must also be appropriate for the ACT.|$|E
5|$|Plutoids are {{celestial}} {{bodies in}} orbit around the Sun at a semi-major axis <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Neptune that have sufficient mass for their self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that they assume a hydrostatic equilibrium (near-spherical) shape, and that have not cleared the neighbourhood around their orbit. Satellites of plutoids are not plutoids themselves.|$|E
5|$|Women's life {{expectancy}} is <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> men, and they have lower death rates throughout life, regardless of race and geographic region. Historically though, women had higher rates of mortality, primarily from maternal deaths (death in childbirth). In industrialised countries, particularly the most advanced, the gender gap narrowed and was reversed following the industrial revolution.|$|E

5|$|As an A-type main {{sequence}} star, Beta Pictoris is more luminous than the Sun: combining the apparent magnitude of 3.861 with {{the distance of}} 19.44 parsecs gives an absolute magnitude of 2.42, {{as compared to the}} Sun, which has an absolute magnitude of 4.83. This corresponds to a visual luminosity 9.2 times <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the Sun. When the entire spectrum of radiation from Beta Pictoris and the Sun is taken into account, Beta Pictoris is found to be 8.7 times more luminous than the Sun.|$|E
5|$|As of 2005 Uranus {{is known}} to have nine {{irregular}} moons, which orbit it at a distance much <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Oberon, the furthest of the large moons. All the irregular moons are probably captured objects that were trapped by Uranus soon after its formation. The diagram illustrates the orbits of those irregular moons discovered so far. The moons above the X axis are prograde, those beneath are retrograde. The radius of the Uranian Hill sphere is approximately 73million km.|$|E
5|$|Asteroseismic {{analysis}} of the star reveals it is approximately 10% more massive than the Sun and significantly older, at around 6.34 billion years. The radius of the star is 36% <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the Sun and it is 90% more luminous. The star contains twice the abundance of iron relative to hydrogen of the Sun and is therefore described as metal-rich. Mu Arae is also more enriched than the Sun in the element helium.|$|E

5|$|Cantor was {{the first}} to {{formulate}} what later {{came to be known as}} the continuum hypothesis or CH: there exists no set whose power is <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the naturals and less than that of the reals (or equivalently, the cardinality of the reals is exactly aleph-one, rather than just at least aleph-one). Cantor believed the continuum hypothesis to be true and tried for many years to prove it, in vain. His inability to prove the continuum hypothesis caused him considerable anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} also binds to the hemeprotein myoglobin. It {{has a high}} {{affinity for}} myoglobin, about 60 times <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> oxygen. Carbon monoxide bound to myoglobin may impair its ability to utilize oxygen. This causes reduced cardiac output and hypotension, which may result in brain ischemia. A delayed return of symptoms have been reported. This results following a recurrence of increased carboxyhemoglobin levels; this effect {{may be due to}} a late release of carbon monoxide from myoglobin, which subsequently binds to hemoglobin.|$|E
5|$|Competition {{can play}} a part in the mating rituals of species such as burying beetles (Nicrophorus), the insects {{fighting}} to determine which can mate. Many male beetles are territorial and fiercely defend their territories from intruding males. In such species, the male often has horns on the head or thorax, making its body length <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> a female. Copulation is generally quick, but in some cases lasts for several hours. During copulation, sperm cells are transferred to the female to fertilize the egg.|$|E

5|$|Compression of a {{white dwarf}} will {{increase}} the number of electrons in a given volume. Applying the Pauli exclusion principle, this will increase the kinetic energy of the electrons, thereby increasing the pressure. This electron degeneracy pressure supports a white dwarf against gravitational collapse. The pressure depends only on density and not on temperature. Degenerate matter is relatively compressible; this means that the density of a high-mass white dwarf is much <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> a low-mass white dwarf and that the radius {{of a white}} dwarf decreases as its mass increases.|$|E
5|$|Fourth, camber thrust {{contributes}} to the centripetal force necessary to cause the bike to deviate from a straight path, along with cornering force due to the slip angle, and can be the largest contributor. Camber thrust {{contributes to}} the ability of bikes to negotiate a turn with the same radius as automobiles but with a smaller steering angle. When a bike is steered and leaned in the same direction, the camber angle of the front tire is <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the rear and so can generate more camber thrust, all else being equal.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{there is}} a unique {{combination}} of traits not in themselves unique. The transverse processes, the side extensions, of the tail are present up to the twenty-eighth vertebra of the series. The transverse processes of the front tail vertebrae are rod-shaped with narrow bases and do not touch the plate formed by the fusion of the processes of the sacral vertebrae. The chevrons, bones pointing to below from the bottom side of the tail vertebrae, have {{the shape of an}} inverted T. The length of the ilium equals, or is <b>greater</b> <b>than,</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the thighbone.|$|E

5|$|In a {{laboratory}} experiment, the average lifespan {{for a male}} Campbell's dwarf hamster in captivity was 278 days and for a female was 356 days. In a different experiment, hamsters kept in captivity born in the summer lived {{for an average of}} 2.0–2.5 years. Young hamsters provided widely varied diets early in life are less likely to suffer digestive problems as they mature, but this is not always possible in the wild due to lack of food; this causes the life expectancy of captive hamsters to be <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> wild hamsters.|$|E
5|$|Juno orbits at a {{slightly}} closer mean {{distance to the}} Sun than Ceres or Pallas. Its orbit is moderately inclined at around 12° to the ecliptic, but has an extreme eccentricity, <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Pluto. This high eccentricity brings Juno closer to the Sun at perihelion than Vesta and further out at aphelion than Ceres. Juno had the most eccentric orbit of any known body until 33 Polyhymnia was discovered in 1854, and of asteroids over 200km in diameter only 324 Bamberga has a more eccentric orbit.|$|E
5|$|Lead's {{close-packed}} face-centered cubic {{structure and}} high atomic weight {{result in a}} density of 11.34g/cm3, which is <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> common metals such as iron (7.87g/cm3), copper (8.93g/cm3), and zinc (7.14g/cm3).
