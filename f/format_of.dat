40|$|This {{study has}} {{explored}} {{the relationships between}} the results <b>of</b> various <b>formats</b> <b>of</b> paper-and-pencil classroom assessments in five classroom chemistry tests. The <b>formats</b> <b>of</b> assessment that have been used were: multiple choice, short answer, and structural communication grid. The study was conducted in Greece with the participation of first year upper secondary public school pupils (Lykeio, Grade 10, age 15 - 16). The correlations between the different <b>formats</b> <b>of</b> assessment tended to be between 0. 30 and 0. 71. This is a wide range but even the highest value is well short of 1. 0. This suggests that the best student found by one method is not necessarily the best student by another method. This raises questions about the validity <b>of</b> the <b>formats</b> <b>of</b> the assessment and what different <b>formats</b> <b>of</b> assessment are testing...|$|R
