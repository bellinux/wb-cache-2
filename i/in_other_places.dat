5|$|The {{territory}} {{between the}} Lower Danube and the Black Sea remained a fully integrated {{part of the}} Roman Empire, even after the abandonment of Trajan's Dacia.

5|$|A {{historic}} Native American path used to {{pass through}} the water gap of Leggetts Creek on its way from the headwaters of the Lehigh River to the Great Bend on the Susquehanna River near the Pennsylvania/New York border. Some mining and quarrying operations have been done in the watershed and the Leggetts Gap Railroad was built through Leggetts Gap in the 19th century. In the late 19th, 20th, and early 21st centuries, numerous bridges were constructed across the creek. Wild trout naturally reproduce within the creek and several other species have been observed in its waters as well. Some reaches of the creek have a riparian buffer consisting of old growth forests. <b>In</b> <b>other</b> <b>places,</b> there are grasslands or invasive plants. A greenway/connecting trail along the creek was proposed in the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan.|$|E
5|$|Although {{classified}} as poisonous, reports of human deaths resulting from its ingestion are extremely rare. After parboiling—which weakens its toxicity and {{breaks down the}} mushroom's psychoactive substances—it is eaten in parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. Amanita muscaria is noted for its hallucinogenic properties, with its main psychoactive constituent being the compound muscimol. The mushroom {{was used as an}} intoxicant and entheogen by the peoples of Siberia, and has a religious significance in these cultures. There has been much speculation on possible traditional use of this mushroom as an intoxicant <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>places</b> such as the Middle East, Eurasia, North America, and Scandinavia.|$|E

5|$|The Jurassic Coast {{is subject}} to severe weather {{conditions}} at times. Violent storms occurred in 1824 and 1974, and these and various lesser storms have battered the cliffs and caused flooding and structural damage in coastal towns. The coast is largely an eroding landscape {{and management of the}} site aims to allow the natural processes of erosion to continue while protecting people and property. Coastal defences have been put in place in Charmouth and Weymouth, where houses are at risk, but <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>places,</b> where the coastline remains in a natural state, the management policy is to take no action and allow erosion to take its course.|$|E
5|$|An 18th-century account {{suggests}} that females {{might have left}} their newborn calves in isolation and returned regularly to suckle them until the calves {{were old enough to}} join herds, which is similar to the behaviour of roan and sable antelopes. Akin to other grazing antelopes, the bluebuck probably calved mainly where rainfall, and thus the availability of grasses, peaked. Such locations could be the western margin of the CFR during winter and the eastern margin of the CFR during summer. Faith et al. 2013 found that the occurrence of juveniles in bluebuck fossils decreases linearly from the west to the east, indicating that most births took place in the western CFR; due to the preference for rainfall, it may be further assumed that most births occurred during winter, when the western CFR receives most of its rainfall. The annual west-to-east migration would have followed in summer, consistent with the greater number of adult juveniles in the east that would have joined herds. Juvenile fossils also occur <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>places</b> across the range, but appear to be concentrated in the western CFR.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} {{of the fact that}} many people use the towpath to exercise their dogs, dog dips have been installed at Allbrook and Shawford. These provide easy access into the water for dogs, and owners are encouraged to only allow dogs to swim at these locations, to conserve the bank <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>places.</b> The water vole surveys have followed the best practice described in the Water Vole Conservation Handbook (2006), and have also recorded evidence of otter, brown rat and American mink populations. While carrying out the work, the surveyors have also counted sightings of kingfisher, heron, moorhen and coot. The bat survey recorded common pipistrelle, soprano pipistrelle, Daubenton's, noctule and serotine bats in 2011. Bat boxes have been erected near Allbrook, and there was some evidence that they were being used. The 2009 fisheries survey recorded large numbers of young Atlantic salmon in the lower river, but although fish weirs have been provided, wild parr were not recorded near Winchester. Above there, a large population of brown trout thrives. Eels were monitored {{for the first time in}} 2009, when their distribution was found to be variable.|$|E
