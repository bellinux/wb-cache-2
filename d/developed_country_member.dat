40|$|Do North-South {{preferential}} trade agreements (PTAs) hold promise for {{the expectation that}} increased economic interdependence contributes to more global peace? Contributing to the commercial institutional peace research, this dissertation {{calls into question the}} practice of treating North-South PTAs as similar to other agreements in assessing their effect on the relationship between trade and interstate armed conflict. The African Growth and Opportunity Act is used to develop and illustrate the following argument behind the contention that North-South nonreciprocal trade agreements are not expected to have a peaceful effect on their members. This type of trade agreement is unlikely to increase volumes of trade among its members, trade preferences incorporated in the agreement are often underutilized by less developed country members, providing few benefits to producers from less <b>developed</b> <b>country</b> <b>member,</b> these agreements do little to promise future expectations of gains from cooperation, and they have been recently used as political tools by developed country members. Results across two large-N logit models of dyadic data for years 1950 - 1985 and 1950 - 1999 suggest there is {{a significant difference between the}} effects of North-South PTAs versus other types of agreements on interstate armed conflict. In addition, North-South PTAs are found to have a null effect on interstate armed conflict, contrary to expectations put forth in the mainstream literature. Furthermore, membership in other types of trade agreements is found to have a positive effect on the probability of armed conflict, questioning the premise in the literature that {{preferential trade}} agreements pave the way for more peace. ...|$|E
40|$|The current world {{trading system}} lacks a {{procedure}} to identify <b>developing</b> <b>country</b> <b>Members,</b> to whom "Special and Differential Treatment" (SDT) is granted. Based on {{the analysis of}} five methods of identifying <b>developing</b> <b>country</b> <b>Members,</b> which are GATT Article XVIII definition, listing, classification, self-designation by SDT grantees, and selection by SDT grantors, we argue that "self-designation," which is widely claimed as the basic method of identifying <b>developing</b> <b>country</b> <b>Members,</b> gives them little certainty and predictability in their rights and obligations in the world trading system. A procedure that can make precise identification of SDT beneficiaries is indispensable {{in order to fulfill}} the WTO's objective of development. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} Chinese-led regional forums {{in the developing}} world where the Chinese preponderance of economic power is self-evident, its financial largesse is readily utilised to sustain these endeavours, its bureaucracies are empowered to guide the conduct of institutional activities, and its normative intentions and interests are given fullest expression. This assessment of two such Chinese-instigated regional forums {{in the developing world}} suggests that despite the professed norms on ‘political equality’ and ‘mutual benefit’ and efforts to ensure the maintenance of Chinese interests over time, China’s stance is increasingly contested by <b>developing</b> <b>country</b> <b>member</b> states. These challenges invariably take the form of struggles over the structuring of key administrative organs and the decision-making process and as such are reflective of norms, interests and expectations held by <b>developing</b> <b>country</b> <b>members.</b> In other words although China holds a preponderance of structural power within these regional forums there is an ongoing process of socialisation—driven by <b>developing</b> <b>country</b> <b>member</b> states—aimed at reshaping China’s behaviour to bring it more closely in line with the other members’ interests...|$|R

40|$|Multiple {{scholarly}} {{works have}} argued that <b>developing</b> <b>country</b> <b>Members</b> of World Trade Organization (WTO) should enhance their dispute settlement capacity to successfully and cost effectively navigate the system of WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU).

The present investigation seeks to conduct a detailed examination of the latter with a specific focus on critically examining public private partnership (PPP) strategies that can enable <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> to effectively utilize the provisions of WTO DSU. To achieve this purpose, the article examines how Brazil, one of the most active DSU users among <b>developing</b> <b>countries,</b> has strengthened its DSU participation by engaging its private stakeholders during the management of WTO disputes.

40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{important}} reasons why lending by regional or sub-regional development banks can and should play an important and valuable complementary role in the international development architecture. We look at the specific strengths of multilateral, regional and sub-regional development banks and drawing on the successful experience of the European Investment Bank and the Andean Development Corporation conclude that the time is now for creating new regional development banks and expanding existing ones. Creating new institutions or expanding existing ones will have very clear benefits, as for instance providing regional public goods which are currently undersupplied, such as regional infrastructure. Very large pools of savings and foreign exchange reserves originate in <b>developing</b> <b>countries</b> these days and therefore the potential for a significant expansion of regional or sub-regional development banks, with only or mainly <b>developing</b> <b>country</b> <b>members</b> has grown significantly.
