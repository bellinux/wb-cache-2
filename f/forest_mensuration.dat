40|$|Detailed <b>forest</b> {{inventory}} and <b>mensuration</b> of individual trees have drawn attention of research society mainly to support sustainable forest management. This study aims at estimating individual tree attributes from high density point cloud obtained by terrestrial laser scanner (TLS). The point clouds were obtained over single reference tree and {{group of trees}} in forest area. The reference tree is treated as benchmark since detailed measurements of branch diameter were made on selected branches with different sizes and locations. Diameter at breast height (DBH) was measured for trees in forest. Furthermore tree height, height to crown base, crown volume and tree branch volume were also estimated for each tree. Branch diameter is estimated directly from the point clouds based on semi-automatic approach of model fitting i. e. sphere, ellipse and cylinder. Tree branch volume is estimated based on {{the volume of the}} fitted models. Tree height and height to crown base are computed using histogram analysis of the point clouds elevation. Tree crown volume is estimated by fitting a convex-hull on the tree crown. The results show that the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of the estimated tree branch diameter does not have a specific trend with branch sizes and number of points used for fitting process. This explains complicated distribution of point clouds over the branches. Overall cylinder model produces good results with most branch sizes and number of point clouds for fitting.

40|$|Even if stand {{inventories}} {{based on}} growth tables {{have been widely}} discussed over the last years, this method of <b>forest</b> <b>mensuration</b> is still widely applied due to favourable ratio between costs and achievable precision of stand growing stock estimation. The aim {{of the study was}} to verify the potential of airborne laser scanning data (ALS) for direct estimation of mean stand height and mean stand density (stocking) as fundamental inputs for <b>forest</b> <b>mensuration</b> based on yield tables. The material from two reference plots with substantially different stand structure was processed by REFLEX software, and confronted with the results of the precise terrestrial inventory. The number of detected tree tops decreased from 100 % in the case of super-dominant trees to 30 % and 5 % in the case of supressed trees at the homogeneous and heterogeneous plot, respectively. The correlation of ALS heights with terrestrially measured heights was R = 0. 88 at the homogenous plot, and R = 0. 77 at the heterogeneous plot. The tendency to underestimate dominant and to overestimate suppressed trees was revealed at both plots, but was more pronounced at the heterogeneous one. Nevertheless we justified that the mean ALS height calculated from the heights of the detected trees represented the biometric mean stand height linked to the stem with the mean basal area quite well. The stocking estimated by REFLEX software according to delineated crowns´ area was also closer to the real value of stocking than the one obtained by the routine mensuration procedure.

The {{aim of this study}} was to assess various methods of analysis of aerial imagery for characterization of the <b>forest</b> <b>mensuration</b> variables (i. e., tree height and crown width) of selected tree species found in the forested region around the temples of Angkor Thom, Cambodia. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) was used (using multiresolution segmentation) to delineate individual tree crowns from very-high-resolution (VHR) aerial imagery and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. Crown width and tree height values that were extracted using multiresolution segmentation showed a high level of congruence with field-measured values of the trees (Spearman's rho 0. 782 and 0. 589, respectively). Individual tree crowns that were delineated from aerial imagery using multiresolution segmentation had a high level of segmentation accuracy (69. 22 %), whereas tree crowns delineated using watershed segmentation underestimated the field-measured tree crown widths. Both spectral angle mapper (SAM) and maximum likelihood (ML) classifications were applied to the aerial imagery for mapping of selected tree species. The latter was found to be more suitable for tree species classification. Individual tree species were identified with high accuracy. Inclusion of textural information further improved species identification, albeit marginally. Our findings suggest that VHR aerial imagery, in conjunction with OBIA-based segmentation methods (such as multiresolution segmentation) and supervised classification techniques are useful for tree species mapping and for studies of the <b>forest</b> <b>mensuration</b> variables...|$|E

Guided by approaches common to cultural and political ecology, environment and development, and land-change science, the study draws on research methods from the social, environmental, and remote sensing sciences. Data include household surveys, community meetings, open-ended interviews with reserve officials, <b>forest</b> <b>mensuration,</b> and land classifications and change detection. The data were analyzed by way of multiple logistic regression and statistical analysis of the variance. The research focuses on three themes. The first links a remote sensing analysis with household surveys to explore the differences in deforestation by economic orientation of communities. Results show that rubber tappers are increasingly turning away from traditional extractive activities, and are instead more dependent on agriculture and smallscale cattle ranching, leading to increasing deforestation within the reserve. The second theme uses a common property framework to explore the institutional dimensions driving land-use/cover-change, revealing that active participation in the reserve's social organization helps to curb deforestation at both the community and household level. The third theme expands the discussion regarding the reserve's management beyond issues of deforestation to consider implications for assessing sustainable forest uses through an examination of two methods [...] remote sensing and <b>forest</b> <b>mensuration</b> [...] of {{the environmental impact of}} two communities, one extractive oriented and one cattle oriented. Results reveal that the land uses emphasized in each community lead to differential ecological impacts. The non-traditional community has a greater impact on forest cover, while the extractive community affects biodiversity indicators more, reducing tree species diversity, density and total basal area, revealing that the scale of analysis matters in assessing the performance of conservation areas. Together, this study reveals the CMER to be a weak common property regime with considerable dynamics in play regarding land use and cover. As rubber tappers become small-scale cattle ranchers, existing rules based on extractive activities become irrelevant. To be successful at governing the reserve's resources, the rules need to be updated, and must be flexible, adapting to changing livelihood trajectories, and recognizing the needs of its residents...|$|E

40|$|One {{of the few}} {{initiatives}} to address ongoing global warming that did not completely stall at the UNFCCC climate change negotiations was the reduction emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD). REDD has {{a focus on the}} forests of the tropics. Unfortunately <b>forest</b> <b>mensuration</b> in most tropical countries has been inadequate to accurately determine forest carbon stocks, much less the effects of land use and changes in land use on them (Houghton et al. 2009; Bryan et al. 2010 a). Whilst tropical logging is known to be widespread, the exact areas of tropical forest subject to logging have not been accurately mapped (Asner et al. 2009) or mapped with sufficient regularity to provide adequate data on the areas subject to this activity. Biomass losses due to logging have usually been derived from limited plot data, or derived via various models from estimates of regional biomass and timber extraction volumes (Houghton et al. 2009) and thus encapsulate considerable uncertainty. For these reasons the carbon impact of tropical logging remains an open question, and one that needs to be closed before any international institutional arrangement considers promoting forms of timber extraction as a tool for controlling carbon emissions.

Availing upon advances in information capture and computing power, geometrically explicit modeling of forest structure becomes increasingly possible. A primary challenge however is acquiring the <b>forest</b> <b>mensuration</b> data required to parameterize these models and the related automation of modeling forest structure. In this research, {{to address these issues}} we employ a novel and automated approach that capitalizes upon the rich information afforded by ground-based laser scanning technology. The method is implemented in two steps: in the first step, geometric explicit models of canopy structure are created from the ground-based laser scanning data. These geometric explicit models are used to simulate the vertical range to first hit. In the second step, we derive canopy gap probability from full waveform laser scanning data which have been used in a number of studies for characterization of radiation transmission (Jupp et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2010) and do not require any geometric explicit modeling. The radiative consistency of the geometric explicit models from step 1 is validated against the gap probabilities of step 2. The results show a strong relationship between the radiative transmission properties of the geometric models and canopy gap probabilities at plot level (R = 0. 91 to 0. 97), while the geometric models suggest the additional benefit to serve as a bridge in scaling between shoot level and canopy level radiation. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology for the attribution and characterisation of Sclerophyll forested landscapes over large areas. First we define {{a set of}} woody vegetation data primitives (e. g. canopy cover, leaf area index (LAI), bole density, canopy height), which are then scaled-up using multiple remote sensing data sources to characterise and extract landscape woody vegetation features. The advantage {{of this approach is}} that vegetation landscape features can be described from composites of these data primitives. The proposed data primitives act as building blocks for the re-creation of past woody characterisation schemes as well as allowing for re-compilation to support present and future policy and management and decision making needs. Three main research sites were attributed; representative of different sclerophyll woody vegetated systems (Box Iron-bark forest; Mountain Ash forest; Mixed Species foothills forest). High resolution hyperspectral and full waveform LiDAR data was acquired over the three research sites. At the same time, land management agencies (Victorian Department of Environment, Land Water and Planning) and researchers (RMIT, CRC for Spatial Information and CSIRO) conducted fieldwork to collect structural and functional measurements of vegetation, using traditional <b>forest</b> <b>mensuration</b> transects and plots, terrestrial lidar scanning and high temporal resolution in-situ autonomous laser (VegNet) scanners. Results are presented of: 1) inter-comparisons of LAI estimations made using ground based hemispherical photography, LAI 2200 PCA, CI- 110 and terrestrial and airborne laser scanners; 2) canopy height and vertical canopy complexity derived from airborne LiDAR validated using ground observations; and, 3) time-series characterisation of land cover features. 1. Accuracy targets for remotely sensed LAI products to match within ground based estimates are ± 0. 5 LAI or a 20...|$|E
40|$|The UNFCCC and {{interest}} in {{the source of the}} missing terrestrial carbon sink are prompting research and development into methods for carbon accounting in forest ecosystems. Here we present a canopy height quantile-based approach for quantifying above ground carbon content (AGCC) in a temperate deciduous woodland, by means of a discrete-return, small-footprint airborne LiDAR. Fieldwork was conducted in Monks Wood National Nature Reserve UK to estimate the AGCC of five stands from <b>forest</b> <b>mensuration</b> and allometric relations. In parallel, a digital canopy height model (DCHM) and a digital terrain model (DTM) were derived from elevation measurements obtained by means of an Optech Airborne Laser Terrain Mapper 1210. A quantile-based approach was adopted to select a representative statistic of height distributions per plot. A forestry yield model was selected as a basis to estimate stemwood volume per plot from these heights metrics. Agreement of r= 0. 74 at the plot level was achieved between ground-based AGCC estimates and those derived from the DCHM. Using a 20 × 20 m grids superposed to the DCHM, the AGCC was estimated at the stand level and at the woodland level. At the stand level, the agreement between the plot data upscaled in proportion to area and the LiDAR estimates was r= 0. 85. At the woodland level, LiDAR estimates were nearly 24 % lower than those from the upscaled plot data. This suggests that field-based approaches alone may not be adequate for carbon accounting in heterogeneous forests. Conversely, the LiDAR 20 × 20 m grid approach has an enhanced capability of monitoring the natural variability of AGCC across the woodland...|$|E
