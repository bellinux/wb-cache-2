Services renderred from that fund are then — besides wages — additional incomes of the society members. They amounted to 2000 złoty in 1960, and to 6915 złoty for one inhabitant in the year 1976. Housekeepings <b>receive</b> <b>income</b> directly <b>in</b> a monetary form {{as well as in the}} form of definite means of consumption and of non-pecuniary services. It depends on material or pecuniar forms of distribution. Housekeepings can freely dispose of <b>incomes</b> <b>received</b> <b>in</b> virtue of social pecuniary services.

From such poin of view these incomes do not differ from <b>incomes</b> <b>received</b> by division according to labour and they are not included into personal incomes. Social services in kind are not included into personal incomes of the people taking advantage of these services. That's why the common accessibility of these services produces a risk of waste. Services from social fund of consumption reduce income disproportions in particular social groups. They do not, however, equalize incomes of the whole society. Such fact would cause breach of principles of functioning the wages policy. An excessive restraint of the role of wages can contribute to decrease in effectivennes and to professional qualification decline. The task of <b>incomes</b> <b>received</b> by the people from social fund of consumption does not consist in levelling differences in wages but it is connected with diminishing social disproportions in working groups with low incomes for one family member.

40|$|Working Paper: WP 2012 - 268 A {{review of}} the {{literature}} suggests that when pension values are measured by the wealth equivalent of promised DB pension benefits and DC balances for those approaching retirement, pensions account for more support in retirement than is suggested when their contribution is measured by <b>incomes</b> <b>received</b> directly from pension plans by those who have already retired. Estimates from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) for respondents in their early fifties suggest that pension wealth is about 82 percent as valuable as Social Security wealth. In data from the Current Population Survey (CPS), for members of the same cohort, measured when they are 65 to 69, pension incomes are about 58 percent as valuable as incomes from Social Security. Our empirical analysis uses data from the HRS to examine the reasons for these differences in the contributions of pensions as measured in income and wealth data. Key factors accounting for these difference include: a difference in methodology between surveys affecting what is included in pension income; some pension wealth "disappears" at retirement because respondents change their pension into other forms that are not counted as pension income; and the form of annuitization may influence the measure of pension income.
