This method decomposes total <b>drag</b> into wave, profile, induced and spurious <b>drag</b> components, the latter resulting from numerical diffusion and errors. Computational {{results show that}} the method reliably predicts <b>drag</b> and is capable of meaningful <b>drag</b> decomposition. The accuracy of <b>drag</b> {{prediction is}} increased by eliminating the spurious <b>drag</b> component from the total <b>drag.</b> It is also confirmed that the physical <b>drag</b> components are almost independent of the mesh resolution or scheme modification...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The added mass, <b>drag</b> and <b>drag</b> {{coefficient}} of a uniform and accelerated motion projectile in viscous incompressible fluid were calculated by numerical simulation and dynamic mesh method. The effect of velocity and acceleration was investigated. The {{results show that}} the variation rules of added mass, <b>drag</b> and <b>drag</b> coefficient are basically the same when the projectile moves at different speeds. The added mass, <b>drag</b> and <b>drag</b> coefficient become smaller and <b>drag</b> becomes bigger with the increase of speed. The variation rules of the added mass, <b>drag</b> and <b>drag</b> coefficient are the same as uniform motion when the projectile moves at different accelerations. The added mass and <b>drag</b> coefficient become smaller and <b>drag</b> becomes bigger with the increase of acceleration. These reveal that the motion region, velocity and acceleration have some effect on the added mass, <b>drag</b> and <b>drag</b> coefficient...|$|R

50|$|<b>Drag</b> {{is a term}} {{applied to}} {{clothing}} and makeup worn on special occasions for performing or entertaining, unlike those who are transgender or who cross-dress for other reasons. <b>Drag</b> performance includes overall presentation and behavior in addition to clothing and makeup. <b>Drag</b> can be theatrical, comedic, or grotesque. <b>Drag</b> queens have been considered caricatures of women by second-wave feminism. <b>Drag</b> artists have a long tradition in LGBT culture. Generally the term <b>drag</b> queen covers men doing female <b>drag,</b> <b>drag</b> king covers women doing male <b>drag,</b> and faux queen covers women doing female <b>drag.</b> Nevertheless, there are <b>drag</b> artists of all genders and sexualities who perform for various reasons. Some <b>drag</b> performers, transvestites, {{and people in the}} gay community have embraced the pornographically-derived term tranny to describe <b>drag</b> queens or people who engage in transvestism or cross-dressing; however this term is widely considered offensive if applied to transgender people.|$|R
50|$|Wave <b>drag</b> {{is one of}} {{the forms}} of <b>drag</b> created by swimmers, the others being {{pressure}} <b>drag</b> and friction <b>drag.</b> Wave <b>drag</b> is created by every movement a swimmer makes in the water. The more wave <b>drag</b> is created, the more energy a swimmer must put out to make progress through the water. Therefore, anything that reduces wave <b>drag</b> will theoretically make it easier for a swimmer to swim faster. The Aquashift suit is claimed to reduce wave <b>drag</b> by as much as 53%, according to the research done by TYR. Their research also claims that the suit reduces <b>drag</b> overall by as much as 10% and pressure <b>drag</b> by 18%.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} wind-tunnel tests that demonstrate a novel <b>drag</b> reduction technique for blunt-based vehicles. For these tests, the forebody roughness of a blunt-based model was modified using micomachined surface overlays. As forebody roughness increases, boundary layer at the model aft thickens {{and reduces the}} shearing effect of external flow on the separated flow behind the base region, resulting in reduced base <b>drag.</b> For vehicle configurations with large base <b>drag,</b> existing data predict that a small increment in forebody friction <b>drag</b> {{will result in a}} relatively large decrease in base <b>drag.</b> If the added increment in forebody skin <b>drag</b> is optimized with respect to base <b>drag,</b> reducing the total <b>drag</b> of the configuration is possible. The wind-tunnel tests results conclusively demonstrate the existence of a forebody dragbase <b>drag</b> optimal point. The data demonstrate that the base <b>drag</b> coefficient corresponding to the <b>drag</b> minimum lies between 0. 225 and 0. 275, referenced to the base area. Most importantly, the data show a <b>drag</b> reduction of approximately 15 % when the <b>drag</b> optimum is reached. When this <b>drag</b> reduction is scaled to the X- 33 base area, <b>drag</b> savings approaching 45, 000 N (10, 000 lbf) can be realized...|$|R

5|$|Off California, sharks {{immobilize}} northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris) {{with a large}} bite to the hindquarters (which is {{the main}} source of the seal's mobility) and wait for the seal to bleed to death. This technique is especially used on adult male elephant seals, which are typically larger than the shark, ranging between , and are potentially dangerous adversaries. Most commonly though, juvenile elephant seals are the most frequently eaten at elephant seal colonies. Prey is normally attacked sub-surface. Harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) are taken from the surface and <b>dragged</b> down until they stop struggling. They are then eaten near the bottom. California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) are ambushed from below and struck mid-body before being <b>dragged</b> and eaten.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the speed {{fluctuation}} and the <b>drag</b> force in young swimmers between genders. Twenty-three young pubertal swimmers (12 boys and 11 girls) volunteered as subjects. Speed fluctuation was measured using a kinematical mechanical method (i. e., speedo-meter) during a maximal 25 -m front crawl bout. Active <b>drag,</b> active <b>drag</b> coefficient and power needed to overcome <b>drag</b> were measured with the velocity perturbation method for another two maximal 25 m front crawl bouts with and without the perturbation device. Passive <b>drag</b> and the passive <b>drag</b> coefficient were estimated using the gliding decay velocity method after a maximal push-off from the wall while being fully immersed. The technique <b>drag</b> index was also assessed as a ratio between active and passive <b>drag.</b> Boys presented meaningfully higher speed fluctuation, active <b>drag,</b> power needed to overcome <b>drag</b> and technique <b>drag</b> index than the girls. There were no significant gender differences for active <b>drag</b> coefficient, passive <b>drag</b> and passive <b>drag</b> coefficient. There were positive and moderate-strong associations between active <b>drag</b> and speed fluctuation when controlling the effects of swim velocity. So, increasing speed fluctuation leads to higher <b>drag</b> force values and those are even higher for boys than for girls...|$|R

50|$|Fly-reel <b>drag</b> {{systems have}} two {{purposes}} 1.) They prevent spool overrun when stripping {{line from the}} reel while casting 2.)Tire out running fish by exerting pressure on the line that runs in the opposite direction.

The caliper <b>drag</b> causes the calipers to brush up against the reel spool. A disc <b>drag</b> is when pressure is applied on the plates which then applies pressure on the spool. Center-line <b>drags</b> also known as the best kind of <b>drag</b> because the pressure is directly on the spool close to the axis of rotation.|$|R

The {{aim of the}} game is to attain a high score by {{performing}} stunts, damaging the jeep during collisions, collecting orbs, and killing the other Velociraptor which run around the area. The vehicle is equipped with a spiked ball and chain which can be deployed from the tailgate as many times as the player wishes. Deploying the spiked ball increases the difficulty of maneuvering the vehicle. The ball can be released from the chain at any time, if done so during a turn the weapon is launched forward. Players kill other Velociraptor by ramming them with the jeep or crushing them with the spiked ball which is <b>dragged</b> behind the vehicle. Slain dinosaurs can be <b>dragged</b> to exporters by the spiked ball and chain to gain extra points. Exporters are teleporting devices which transport the slain dinosaurs to the future.|$|E
