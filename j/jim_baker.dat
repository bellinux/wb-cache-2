2500|$|Leeds's first fixture {{after their}} {{election}} to the league was against Port Vale, the club who had taken up Leeds City's fixtures following their expulsion. Leeds lost the game 2–0, but seven days later recorded their first victory in the corresponding fixture at Elland Road, which ended Leeds United 3 Port Vale 1. [...] However, Leeds made little impact in 1920–21, their first season, eventually finishing 14th. Following seasons saw them consolidate {{their position in the}} league, finishing 8th in 1921–22 and 7th in 1922–23, before winning the Second Division Championship in 1923–24 with 54 points. The championship winning team was a strong one, with <b>Jim</b> <b>Baker,</b> Bert Duffield and Ernie Hart featuring prominently.|$|E
2500|$|After the Second World War, however, Anderson began exhibiting more {{conservative}} views. <b>Jim</b> <b>Baker</b> interprets this latter stage {{not so much}} as [...] "a definite change in his overall thinking than ... an alteration of emphasis and interest". In other words, according to Baker, while Anderson's political positions changed over time his philosophy remained constant. To many, however, it seemed that Anderson was departing from his pluralism. During the 1949 coal miners' strike, for instance, he supported the government's action in using troops as strikebreakers. At a Free Thought Society meeting in August 1950 he refused to oppose conscription for the war in Korea. In 1951 he refused to allow students to use the Free Thought Society to canvass the 'No' case for Menzies' attempt to ban the Communist Party in the referendum of that year. This was the last straw for many Freethinkers; Anderson's apparent authoritarianism caused most to abandon the Free Thought Society and to establish the Libertarian Society. (It must be pointed out that Anderson did not support the banning of the Communist Party—in fact he attacked the proposal.) The Free Thought Society held its last meeting in 1951. The Libertarian Society functioned from 1952 to 1969.|$|E

6000|$|Animals {{talk to each}} other, of course. There can be no {{question}} about that; but I suppose {{there are very few}} people who can understand them. I never knew but one man who could. I knew he could, however, because he told me so himself. He was a middle-aged, simple-hearted miner who had lived in a lonely corner of California, among the woods and mountains, a good many years, and had studied the ways of his only neighbors, the beasts and the birds, until he believed he could accurately translate any remark which they made. This was <b>Jim</b> <b>Baker.</b> According to <b>Jim</b> <b>Baker,</b> some animals have only a limited education, and some use only simple words, and scarcely ever a comparison or a flowery figure; whereas, certain other animals have a large vocabulary, a fine command of language and a ready and fluent delivery; consequently these latter talk a great deal; they like it; they are so conscious of their talent, and they enjoy [...] "showing off." [...] Baker said, that after long and careful observation, he had {{come to the conclusion that}} the bluejays were the best talkers he had found among birds and beasts. Said he: ...|$|E
60|$|Louisa's {{eyes were}} aching. Constant {{watching}} had tired them; they even ceased to see clearly. Her brain too had become somnolent. She {{was tired of}} hearing these people talk. From the moment that <b>Jim</b> <b>Baker</b> had stated that the murdered man was his own son, Louisa had known that he had spoken the truth. Instinct was guiding her toward the truth, showing her the truth, wherever possible. She listened at first--deeply interested--to the scrappy evidence which told of Paul Baker's early life, but the family from Clapham Junction Road had marvellously little to relate. They no more understood their adventurous-spirited son {{than they would have}} been capable of aiding and abetting the fraud which he concocted.|$|E

By the strange caprice of wanton coincidence the meeting occurred inside Green Park. Paul seemed a little worried, thinking that the passers-by would see him talking to [...] "poor people like us," [...] as Emily Baker had it, [...] "although," [...] she added proudly, [...] "I 'ad me new 'at on, with the pink roses."
