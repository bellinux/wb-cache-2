500|$|An early nineteenth-century {{excavation}} found underground apartments [...] "of considerable {{extent and}} superior workmanship", and excavations {{in the latter}} part of the same century found considerable foundations in the gardens of Castle Farm. Castle Mills housing estate contains a now-covered well 2m (6ft) in width and 15m (50ft) deep, and work in 1961 uncovered massive 5m (16ft) foundations east of the old mill and on the same alignment as the existing wall. Excavations in 1969–1971 found an extensive network of walls faced with ashlar, a <b>door</b> <b>post,</b> the base of a spiral staircase and evidence of an outer courtyard. Many stones had mason's marks. During construction works in 1988, masonry including the rubble centres of two large east–west walls was found in test trenches. Apart from the area of the turret bases next to the standing wall, none of the archaeology is now visible.|$|E

60|$|I {{know well}} that my friend Spugg {{would be glad}} to be rid of his wealth altogether, if such a thing were possible. Till I {{understood}} about these things, I always imagined that wealth could be given away. It appears that it cannot. It is a burden that one must carry. Wealth, if one has enough of it, becomes a form of social service. One regards it as a means of doing good to the world, of helping to brighten the lives of others--in a word, a solemn trust. Spugg has often talked with me so long and so late on this topic--the duty of brightening the lives of others--that the waiter who held blue flames for his cigarettes fell asleep against a <b>door</b> <b>post,</b> and the chauffeur outside froze to the seat of his motor.|$|E

60|$|Rollo asked Jonas {{what was}} the way to draw a noon line. Jonas told him that there were several ways. One way, he said, was to observe some day, by the clock, when it was exactly noon, and then to mark, upon the barn floor, the line where the shadow of the edge of the post fell {{precisely}} at that moment. Another way was to get a compass needle, and put it down upon the floor, and then draw a north and south line precisely in the direction that the needle indicated. That would, of course, be a north and south line, because the compass needle always pointed north and south. He said that he adopted both these methods to make his noon line. First, he got a compass needle, which Rollo's father had lent him, and put that down upon the barn floor just {{at the foot of the}} <b>door</b> <b>post,</b> and observed the direction; and he also noticed when it was twelve, by the clock in the house, and he found that, when it was twelve by the clock, the shadow of the post came exactly to the line indicated by the direction of the compass needle; and so he knew that that was a correct meridian line.|$|E
