25|$|Application of {{electronic}} ballasts {{is growing in}} popularity. Most newer generation electronic ballasts can operate both <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>sodium</b> (HPS) lamps as well as metal-halide lamps, reducing costs for building managers who use both types of lamps. So, the ballast, at the beginning works as a starter for the voltaic arc, supplying a high-voltage impulse and, later, it works as a limiter/regulator of the electric flow inside the circuit. Electronic ballasts (digital ballasts) also run much cooler and are lighter than their magnetic counterparts.|$|E
40|$|Data from 13 {{randomised}} trials on {{the effect}} of sodium restriction on blood pressure were analysed. The hypotensive effect of sodium restriction was found to be small and restricted largely to systolic blood pressure, which fell by an average of 3. 6 mm Hg (range 0. 5 - 10. 0 mm Hg). The reduction increased with age and in those with <b>higher</b> blood <b>pressure.</b> <b>Sodium</b> restriction therefore seems to be of limited use in those who are most eligible for non-pharmacological treatment of <b>high</b> blood <b>pressure</b> [...] namely, young patients with mild hypertension...|$|R
5000|$|There are two {{varieties}} of such lamps: low <b>pressure</b> and <b>high</b> <b>pressure.</b> Low-pressure <b>sodium</b> lamps are highly efficient electrical light sources, but their yellow light restricts applications to outdoor lighting such as street lamps. [...] High-pressure sodium lamps produce a broader spectrum of light than the low-pressure lamps, {{but they still}} have poorer color rendering than other types of lamps. Low-pressure sodium lamps only give monochromatic yellow light and so inhibit color vision at night.|$|R

FLiBe salt has low hygroscopy and solubility in water.|$|R
25|$|Disadvantages of low {{pressure}} sodium lighting are that fixtures must usually {{be larger than}} competing fixtures, and that color cannot be distinguished, due to its emitting principally a single wavelength of light (see security lighting). Due to the substantial size of the lamp, particularly in higher wattages such as 135 W and 180 W, control of light emissions from {{low pressure}} sodium luminaires is more difficult. For applications requiring more precise direction of light (such as narrow roadways) the native lamp efficacy advantage of this lamp type is decreased and may be entirely lost compared to <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>sodium</b> lamps. Allegations that this also leads to higher amounts of light pollution from luminaires running these lamps arise principally because of older luminaires with poor shielding, still widely in use in the UK and in some other locations. Modern low-pressure sodium fixtures with better optics and full shielding, and the decreased skyglow impacts of yellow light preserve the luminous efficacy advantage of low-pressure sodium and result in most cases is less energy consumption and less visible light pollution. Unfortunately, due to continued lack of accurate information, many lighting professionals continue to disparage low-pressure sodium, contributing to its decreased acceptance and specification in lighting standards and therefore its use. Another disadvantage of low-pressure sodium lamps is that some people find the characteristic yellow light very displeasing aesthetically.|$|E

The low thermal conductivity minimizes thermal losses in the lamp while in the operating state, and the low ionization potential causes the breakdown voltage of the gas to be relatively low in the cold state, which allows the lamp to be more easily started.|$|E

50|$|Most plants grow under most light spectra, {{but always}} prefer a full {{spectrum}} light. A test performed by Ed Rosenthal {{found that when}} a room was set up using both <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>sodium</b> (HPS) and metal halide (MH) lamps, the plants in between the two lights did better than those under MH alone but not {{as well as those}} under HPS. However, certain plants (as cannabis) can be grown successfully under both types of light.

40|$|SUMMARY Male Sprague-Dawley rats with {{unilateral}} renal artery stenosis and a contralateral untouched kidney {{develop a}} malignant hypertension (MH) which {{is characterized by}} <b>high</b> blood <b>pressures,</b> <b>sodium</b> and water depletion, and subsequent activation of the renin-angiotensin system. In the present studies we found plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) concentrations 3 -fold higher than those in rats with benign renal hypertension, and 4 - to 5 -fold higher than those in normotensive control rats. Analysis of individual values showed considerable scatter; about 50 % of the values fell {{in the range of}} benign hypertensive or control rats. When a specific AVP antiserum was injected, iv, into eight conscious unrestrained MH rats, BP transiently fell toward control values in four; in one, BP fell by only 10 mm Hg, and three other MH rats showed no response. In the same rats, injection of a specific angiotensin II antiserum always induced a transient fall in BP. On the basis of these and previously reported observations, we conclude that, subsequent to sodium and water loss and activation of the renin-angiotensin system, vasopressin release is stimulated in a significant number of MH rats and that, in these rats, vasopressin may cause significant systemic vasoconstriction. Thereby vasopressin may {{contribute to the development of}} malignant renal hypertension in rats.
