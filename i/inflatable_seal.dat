50|$|An <b>inflatable</b> <b>seal</b> can be moulded into a concave, flat or {{convoluted}} configuration. Once {{an inflatable}} medium is placed between the seal and the force, the seal expands and rounds out {{to create a}} firm barrier between a mounting and striking surface.The <b>inflatable</b> <b>seal</b> is uniquely designed to return to its original state once the source of inflation has been removed.

An <b>inflatable</b> <b>seal</b> at the hinge-break enabled cabin {{pressure to be}} maintained, and eight hydraulic-operated locks assured structural integrity. The tail could be opened from controls within the tail in 90 seconds. The flight controls at the joint were maintained by a system of push pads.|$|E

40|$|This {{invention}} concerns an <b>inflatable</b> <b>seal</b> assembly {{adapted for}} use with a bayonet quick-disconnect system particularly useful for the insulated transfer of cryogenic consumables in orbit (such as between a space station and a re-supply vehicle). The zero-leak cryogenic coupling includes a polymeric seal clamped to a male bayonet member with two pairs of tightening rings. The tightening rings threadably engage each other in respective pairs around tapered ends of the <b>inflatable</b> <b>seal</b> member so that a wedging action tightens the seal member about the male bayonet. Once in place, the seal may be inflated via an inflation port so that its expansion provides pressure contact with the inside surface of a coaxial female member...|$|E
40|$|An <b>inflatable</b> <b>seal</b> {{acts as a}} pressure-tight zipper {{to provide}} {{traversing}} capability for instrumentation rakes and probes. A specially designed probe segment with a teardrop cross-section {{in the vicinity of}} the <b>inflatable</b> <b>seal</b> minimizes leakage at the interface. The probe is able to travel through a lengthwise slot in a pressure vessel or wind tunnel section, while still maintaining pressure integrity. The design uses two commercially available inflatable seals, opposing each other, to cover the probe slot in a wind tunnel wall. Proof-of-concept tests were conducted at vessel pressures up to 30 psig, with seals inflated to 50 psig, showing no measurable leakage along the seal's length or around the probe teardrop cross-section. This seal concept can replace the existing technology of sliding face plate/O-ring systems in applications where lengthwise space is limited...|$|E
40|$|An airtight, {{flexible}} joint is disclosed for the interfacing of two pressure vessels such as between the Space Station docking tunnel and the Space Shuttle Orbiter bulkhead adapter. The joint provides for flexibility while still retaining a structural {{link between the}} two vessels required due to the loading created by the internal/external pressure differential. The joint design provides for limiting the axial load carried across the joint to a specific value, a function returned in the Orbiter/Station tunnel interface. The flex joint comprises a floating structural segment which is permanently attached {{to one of the}} pressure vessels through the use of an <b>inflatable</b> <b>seal.</b> The geometric configuration of the joint causes the tension between the vessels created by the internal gas pressure to compress the <b>inflatable</b> <b>seal.</b> The inflation pressure of the seal is kept at a value above the internal/external pressure differential of the vessels in order to maintain a controlled distance between the floating segment and pressure vessel. The <b>inflatable</b> <b>seal</b> consists of either a hollow torus-shaped flexible bladder or two rolling convoluted diaphragm seals which may be reinforced by a system of straps or fabric anchored to the hard structures. The joint acts as a flexible link to allow both angular motion and lateral displacement while it still contains the internal pressure and holds the axial tension between the vessels...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This report {{documents}} {{the development of}} three experimental pipeline couplers for rapid repair of fuel lines damaged in an attack. The experimental couplers are: (1) the Cold Forge coupler, (2) the Internal Coupler, and (3) the <b>Inflatable</b> <b>Seal</b> Coupler. The focus of the evaluation {{was to determine the}} feasibility of rapidly repairing bomb-damaged fuel lines with each coupler, particularly underground pipelines made of carbon steel. Evaluating the feasibility of repair with each coupler was based on such aspects as installation speed and effectiveness. The test results confirmed that each coupler could be used during base recovery operations to rapidly and effectively repair a fuel pipeline that may be out-of-round or highly misaligned. Recommend that each experimental coupler be taken into advanced development for extensive testing and field evaluation. jj E¥ 11 ELECTE...|$|E
40|$|Confinement of all {{radioactive}} {{materials in the}} NUHOMS®- 32 PT system {{is provided by the}} NUHOMS®- 32 PT DSC which is designed and tested to meet the leak tight criteria [7. 1]. As discussed in Section 7. 2. 2, the release of airborne radioactive material is addressed for three phases of system operation: fuel handling in the spent fuel pool, drying and sealing of the DSC, and DSC transfer and storage. Potential airborne releases from irradiated fuel assemblies in the spent fuel pool are discussed in the plant's existing 1 OCFR 50 license. DSC drying and sealing operations are performed using procedures which prohibit airborne leakage. During these operations, all vent lines are routed to the existing radwaste systems of the plant. Once the DSC is dried and sealed, there are no design basis accidents, which could result in a breach of the DSC and the airborne release of radioactivity. Design provisions to preclude the release of gaseous fission products as a result of accident conditions are discussed in Section 8. 2. 9. During transfer of the sealed DSC and subsequent storage in the HSM, the only postulated mechanism for the release of airborne radioactive material is the dispersion of non-fixed surface contamination on the DSC exterior. By filling the cask/DSC annulus with demineralized water, placing an <b>inflatable</b> <b>seal</b> over the annulus, and utilizing procedures which require examination of the annulus surfaces for smearable contamination, the contamination limits on the DSC can be kept below the permissible level for off-site shipments of fuel. Therefore, there is no possibility of significant radionuclide release from the DSC exterior surface during transfer or storage...|$|E

50|$|The Tiger {{tank was}} too heavy for small bridges, so it was {{designed}} to ford four-metres deep in water. This required unusual mechanisms for ventilation and cooling when underwater. At least 30 minutes of set-up time was required, with the turret and gun being locked in the forward position, and a large snorkel tube raised at the rear. An <b>inflatable</b> doughnut-shaped ring <b>sealed</b> the turret ring. The two rear compartments (each containing a fuel tank, radiator and fans) were floodable.

40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in {{partnership}} with Strata Products tested the sealing capability of Ventstop 222 ̆ 01 e 2 {{as part of an}} ongoing mine fire control and suppression research program. Ventstop 222 ̆ 01 e 2 is a multi-purpose, inflatable device that is produced by Minvent Solutions and is available world wide for use in the metal and nonmetal mining industry. Ventstop 222 ̆ 01 e 2 is also used in the Australian coal industry as a temporary ventilation control device. The device can be quickly deployed, is reusable and can be placed in horizontal and vertical mine voids to control dust, fumes and smoke. Deployment, multi-day inflation and air leakage tests were conducted at the NIOSH Lake Lynn Laboratory to determine the capability and limitations of Ventstop 222 ̆ 01 e 2 in a simulated coal mine setting. During the tests, Ventstop 222 ̆ 01 e 2 was also subjected to low level forces of a nearby methane gas ignition. It is thought that Ventstop 222 ̆ 01 e 2 could be used by the US coal mining industry to temporarily close an underground mine area in response to a fire or spontaneous combustion heating event, to temporarily redirect mine ventilation during longwall equipment moves or during stopping construction.
