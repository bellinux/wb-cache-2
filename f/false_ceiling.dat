5|$|The station's fourth span was renovated in 2010, {{involving}} {{repair and}} {{restoration of the}} original glazed roof, so that platforms 9 to 12 inclusive can once more enjoy daylight. A <b>false</b> <b>ceiling</b> or crash deck had been in place since 1996. Work was completed and the restored roof unveiled in July 2011. A second phase of improvements began in July 2014 and was completed two years later. Network Rail originally planned to demolish Span 4 and build an office block over {{that part of the}} station; Save Britain's Heritage successfully campaigned against this.|$|E
5|$|Construction on the 63rd Street Line, {{including}} the Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station, began on November 25, 1969. The station was built {{using a combination}} of cut-and-cover construction and tunneling machines. However, after the construction of the Second Avenue Subway ceased in 1975 due to the city's severe fiscal crisis, the BMT 63rd Street Line side, the northern tracks, basically led to a non-existent subway line, so the BMT side was abandoned and walled off with a temporary orange brick wall, and a <b>false</b> <b>ceiling</b> was placed on the upper level's IND 63rd Street Line side, the southern side. Finishing touches were only applied to the IND side of the station. The tracks on the closed-off BMT side were used only to store trains outside of rush hour.|$|E
5|$|However, in 2007, {{construction}} resumed on the Second Avenue Subway, {{and as part}} of the line's construction, the BMT side of {{the station}} would finally be used. The orange wall was removed and replaced by a temporary barrier. Beige-white wall tiles were installed on the station walls adjacent to the tracks. The never-opened entrance at Third Avenue was redesigned with multiple elevators, and the station's <b>false</b> <b>ceiling</b> was removed. Before Second Avenue Subway service began operating, the temporary walls were removed, revealing the BMT side of the station. On January 1, 2017, {{the first phase of the}} Second Avenue Subway opened, with Q trains, and limited rush hour N trains serving the BMT half of the station. Ridership has increased at the station with the opening of the Third Avenue exit and the introduction of Q service. Many passengers now take advantage of the cross-platform transfer available between the F and the Q.|$|E
50|$|ACP {{is mainly}} used for {{external}} and internal architectural cladding or partitions, <b>false</b> <b>ceilings,</b> signage, machine coverings, container construction, etc. Applications of ACP {{are not limited to}} external building cladding, but can also be used in any form of cladding such as partitions, <b>false</b> <b>ceilings,</b> etc. ACP is also widely used within the signage industry as an alternative to heavier, more expensive substrates.|$|R

The contract will include options for two one-year extensions beyond the initial threeyear period...|$|R
25|$|Lanier's {{first floor}} flooded in 1998 due to Tropical Storm Frances. In the early 2000s (decade), to reduce echoing in the {{classrooms}} and to allow easier installation of network hardware, a <b>false</b> <b>ceiling</b> was installed in almost all classrooms and hallways. Sometime after 2001, televisions that were in every classroom were removed.|$|E
25|$|In the {{original}} Tube design, trains passing through close fitting tunnels act as pistons to create air pressure gradients between stations. This pressure difference drives ventilation between platforms {{and the surface}} exits through the passenger foot network. This system depends on adequate cross sectional area of the airspace above the passengers’ heads in the foot tunnels and escalators, where laminar airflow {{is proportional to the}} fourth power of the radius, the Hagen–Poiseuille equation. It also depends on an absence of turbulence in the tunnel headspace. In many stations the ventilation system is now ineffective because of alterations that reduce tunnel diameters and increase turbulence. An example is Green Park tube station, where <b>false</b> <b>ceiling</b> panels attached to metal frames have been installed that reduce the above-head airspace diameter by more than half in many parts. This has the effect of reducing laminar airflow by some 94%.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} {{takes advantage}} of the sloping site to include a sub-floor dining room which runs the length of the stand beneath the front seating. This is accessed via stairs at the front which lead to a number of sets of entrance doors just below ground level. This dining room has been refurbished, with new entrance doors, new leadlight windows and a <b>false</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Most of the original arched leadlight windows at each end have been sheeted over. Behind the dining room, cut into the slope of the land, is a long kitchen. At the southeast end of the kitchen is a store room and a steep timber stair leading up to the service entrance. There are also toilets at the sub-floor level, accessed externally. The men's toilet is located at the southeast end of the building and the women's at the northwest end.|$|E

2500|$|The depot’s {{exterior}} is unaltered {{from its}} original design and the interior is structurally intact except for a <b>false</b> <b>ceiling</b> installed in the passenger waiting room. [...] The date of this alteration is unknown. [...] The station’s original equipment and furnishings were removed after Southern Pacific abandoned the building in 1975. [...] Beginning in 1978, private owners replaced damaged window frames and rotted floorboards in the waiting room. [...] Plaster walls have also been patched and refinished. [...] The interior doors, window trim, staircase, and exposed ceiling beams have been stripped and refinished to restore their original form and treatment.|$|E
2500|$|On 7 August 2008, 10% of {{the ceiling}} of the plenary chamber {{collapsed}}. No one was injured, as Parliament was not meeting at the time (it was in summer recess), though a number of seats were damaged. A first part {{of the ceiling}} collapsed at 18.00 CET followed by a second part at 22.36 CET. No extreme weather conditions were reported and the structure was new, so it was assumed that the <b>false</b> <b>ceiling</b> had a defect. The President's office stated that a third of the ceiling had been affected and that [...] "The preliminary results have revealed that the partial collapse of the ceiling resulted from the breakage of parts holding the suspended ceiling that connects it with the actual structure of the ceiling." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{walls of}} the {{apartment}} were completely hung with splendid tapestries which hid any windows or doors which may have pierced them.

50|$|The <b>false</b> <b>ceiling</b> {{above the}} roadway, which {{consisted}} of a 6 in, insitu, reinforced concrete slab, collapsed completely in several places and collapsed partially over a length of approximately 500 feet (150 m).|$|E
50|$|A gallery {{for staff}} use was also {{created in the}} Tiled Hall where further book stock was shelved and work space was created for the typists from the {{cataloguing}} department. The ceiling and walls of the Tiled Hall were then hidden for nearly fifty years behind a <b>false</b> <b>ceiling,</b> bookcases and panelling. The Music Library was moved into the Tiled Hall space in 1998 but was only there until 1999, when the Central Library building closed for refurbishment and rewiring. The 1950s panelling and bookcases were removed, along with the <b>false</b> <b>ceiling,</b> to once more reveal the Tiled Hall and the inevitable damage caused by work done in the 1950s.|$|E

50|$|Any {{building}} {{requires a}} certain amount of internal infrastructure to function, which includes such elements like heating / cooling, power and telecommunications, water and wastewater etc. Especially in commercial buildings (such as offices or factories), these can be extremely intricate systems taking up large amounts of space (sometimes located in separate areas or double floors / <b>false</b> <b>ceilings)</b> and constitute {{a big part of the}} regular maintenance required.|$|R
50|$|The Halbe {{train station}} on this line was used from 1866 {{until just before}} the First World War in 1912 when the {{building}} was adapted for other uses, primarily by reducing the installation of partitions and with {{the height of the}} rooms being reduced with <b>false</b> <b>ceilings.</b> Furthermore, a single-storey porch was added to the structure to the south and the goods sheds to the north were extended.|$|R
