Following an initial brief introduction to corpus-based analyses of academic writing, the article zooms in on learner corpora, describing some of the findings that <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> <b>corpus</b> studies of L 2 learners’ EAP writing. The next section examines the use of corpora in EAP materials design and shows that the few existing corpus-informed EAP tools tend to be based on native corpora only. The article then reports on a collaborative corpus-based project between the Centre for English Corpus Linguistics (Université catholique de Louvain) and Macmillan Education, which aims to describe a number of rhetorical functions particularly prominent in academic writing. The analysis of learner corpus data and their comparison with data <b>from</b> native <b>corpora</b> have highlighted a number of problems which non-native learners experience when writing academic essays, e. g. lack of register awareness, phraseological infelicities, semantic misuse. In this article, we illustrate how these findings were used to inform a 30 -page academic writing section in the second edition of the Macmillan English Dictionary for Advanced Learners...|$|R

The analysis of newsroom photographs is necessarily multidimensional. It allows us to conduct a socio-historical study of how workplaces are created and structured and how information is produced. It paves the way for an analysis of the media’s modes of representation within the logic of external communication (to establish and promote its brand image through videos or pictures). It also permits us to make inferences while analyzing the organizational and managerial aspects of a company, and reveals the value of examining the objects used by journalists in their trade.

40|$|Aside {{from their}} {{intrinsic}} {{value for the}} purposes of language description, corpora can be used in language courses under the broad umbrella term of "data-driven learning", or DDL (Johns 1990). They {{can be used as a}} teaching aid or learning tool, but also as a reference resource, particularly for writing and revision / error-correction, with an increasing body of empirical evidence (cf. Boulton in press) largely concerning students needing English for academic purposes. Corpora can also be used as a reference resource in translation, and here the DDL-related research focuses largely on translation trainees (e. g. Beeby et al. 2009). However, as Zanettin (2009) points out, translation is also a staple activity in many undergraduate language programmes where learners may also benefit <b>from</b> <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation,</b> and not just to help with the immediate translation assignment. The techniques involved build on many cognitive and metacognitive skills (O'Sullivan 2007), and once mastered, can be applied to other language courses and a variety of future language needs. The main research question in this paper is thus: Can general language corpora be used by non-translation students for translation purposes? The students in this study are enrolled in a translation course in the third year of a degree in English at the distance education centre of a French university. They have no prior experience of corpus use and are expected only to work only with freely available on-line monolingual corpora of contemporary English. The simple interface provided by Mark Davies ([URL] to large corpora of British and American English (100 million and 400 + million words respectively) is widely used for such purposes, with over two thirds of all users declaring their primary interest as language learning, teaching or translation. The sites are suitable for novice users to navigate and are accompanied by tutorials and help features; this is highly desirable in the distance teaching context where face-to-face input is not an option, and means that the course itself can keep the introduction to the basic concepts and techniques to a minimum. After that, the constraints of the distance context play to the strengths of constructivism as the students explore the corpora on their own; though email contact with the teacher is possible, and there are discussion forums to facilitate peer-to-peer collaboration, these are generally under-used. Following an earlier pilot study, the results presented here are based on on-line examinations where the methodology component requires the students to choose sections of a previously unseen text and demonstrate and explain how they use corpora to solve the problems encountered in context. Comparing data from two sessions shows how the students come to grips with corpora for translation, and allows a qualitative analysis of individual performance on the various techniques used with greater or lesser success. These data are backed up by questionnaires submitted after the examinations to gain feedback from both successful and less successful students. Particular attention is accorded to corpus use beyond the usual concordance lines, including frequencies, register distributions, collocates lists, word comparisons, and so on, which allow the learner to ask not just 'can I say this?', but 'is this appropriate in this translation context?'...|$|R

More specifically, we focus on a subset of nominal temporal expressions which adhere to the “number + time unit” pattern, matching what Haspelmath (1997 : 26) describes as “culture-bound artificial time units”. Using the British National Corpus (BNC) and the National Corpus of Polish (NCP), we first analyse both the variation and the regularity found in naturally-occurring samples of Polish and English.

Criticism of the Cloete versification of the metrical psalms is evaluated by comparing the Totius and Cloete versification {{with the aid of}} a corpus linguistic analysis. The analysis is presented against the backdrop of a critical assessment of assumptions about language and translation that underlie the recent debates on psalm versification. The assumption of a transparent relation between fixed meanings and specific words, as well as the degree to which formal equivalence can be attained in translation, is identified as the points of departure of the critics of the Cloete versification. The data analysis shows that the two versifications share many similarities, but the differences are limited. In the Totius versification, archaic forms are used more often. Dutch as well as archaic grammatical constructions such as the genitive, dative and verbal inflection are still occasionally encountered. There are also many nouns in the Totius versification, which points to a more formal poetic style. By contrast, there are more verbs in the Cloete versification, as well as language features that are typical of a spoken language register. Really substantial theological differences do not <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> the <b>corpus</b> analysis. For instance, where Totius uses three names for God, Cloete uses a wider range of adjectives that encode similar meanings to what Totius encodes in proper nouns. [URL]...|$|R
30|$|Drawing on {{conceptual}} metaphor theory (henceforth CMT), {{we examine}} the experiential basis, cultural relevance, and political functions of the CCP’s anti-corruption metaphors {{by focusing on the}} source domain concepts from both conceptual and cultural perspectives, and the strategic employment of metaphorical entailments associated with these concepts. Our analysis enriches the literature on the potential of metaphor as an instrument of cognitive and affective manipulation, a device of strategic discourse, and a tool in shaping public opinion. In addition, we analyze the metaphors used in the anti-corruption discourse in the English language version of the PD. By comparing and contrasting the source domains of the metaphors, we demonstrate the audience-specific employment of metaphor in communication, drawing implications for the role of cultural models and epistemic conventions in the metaphorical construction of social reality. Section 2 discusses the basic tenets of CMT and its role in understanding the conceptual foundation of political metaphors. Section 3 introduces the corpus data source and research methods. Section 4 presents results from analyzing the metaphor source domains that <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> the <b>corpus</b> analysis of the Chinese edition of the PD, and compares these with those that are found in the English edition in terms of audience-oriented metaphor choice informed by culture-specific conceptual resources and epistemic conventions.

40|$|The {{media has}} played an {{important}} role in the ‘Global War on Terror’, and has received significant scholarly attention as a result. However, the way in which different media represent and construct notions of success and failure has been less well examined. In addressing this gap, this article offers a comparative analysis of several hundred media sources drawn from Western and English language Arab press outlets, published up until the turn of the decade. Through this analysis, the paper examines the way in which different sources understand progress and regress in the conflict. The themes that <b>emerge</b> <b>from</b> this <b>corpus</b> suggest, not only that the two sets of sources demonstrate different conceptualisations of success and failure, but more interestingly, that through construction of specific metrics, they betray very different understandings about the nature of the conflict itself. In turn this constructs quite different interpretations of what ‘winning’ the ‘Global War on Terror’ might mean for the protagonists. In a largely consistent interpretation of the GWOT, Arab media interpret the conflict through the lens of American efforts to assert power and influence on a global stage. Western media metrics, on the other hand, evolve from a largely militaristic confrontation, to an ideological conflict, and finally constructing the GWOT as a global effort to bring down a movement. Notably, according to both Arab and Western measures, the media sources examined here suggest America is losing.   </p...|$|R

Nonetheless, the multiple affordances of a corpus approach provide reason to think the investment might have larger pay-offs than often realised: familiarity with corpora can be applied across sub-disciplines in many if not all courses in a typical university degree in language. Further, learners can start using corpora productively even with minimal training in distance education, quickly going beyond simple concordancing. The students in this study are enrolled in a translation course in the third year of a degree in English at a French distance education centre. While corpora are widely used in translation teaching, this often involves the compilation of specific parallel corpora by the students. In this course, students have no prior experience of corpus use and are expected only to work only with freely available on-line monolingual corpora of contemporary English, thus enabling them to work immediately. The simple interface provided by Mark Davies ([URL] to large corpora of British (100 million words) and American (400 million words) English is widely used for such purposes, with over two thirds of all users declaring their primary interest as language learning, teaching or translation.

40|$|In {{the rapidly}} {{changing}} environment of language learning and teaching, electronic literacies have {{an increasingly important}} role to play. While much research on new literacies focuses on the World Wide Web, the aim {{in this study is}} to investigate the importance of <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> as a new type of literacy which is of particular relevance in the context of language learning and teaching. After briefly situating the theoretical and pedagogical context of the study in relation to authenticity and learner autonomy, the paper describes an empirical study involving eight postgraduate students of French. As part of a Masters course they write a short text and subsequently attempt to improve it by using concordancing software to consult a small corpus containing texts on a similar subject. The analysis of the results reveals a significant number of changes made by the learners which may be classified as follows in order of frequency: grammatical errors (gender and agreement, prepositions, verb forms/mood, negation and syntax); misspellings, accents and hyphens; lexico- grammatical patterning (native language interference, choice of verb and inappropriate vocabulary); and capitalisation. The conclusion notes that the situation in which these students found themselves (i. e. faced with a text on which the teacher had indicated phrases which could be improved) is replicated in many cases every day, and suggests that <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> may have a useful role to play in the context of interactive feedback, particularly in cases where traditional language learning resources are of little use.

40|$|An {{increasing}} {{number of studies have}} looked at the value of corpus-based data-driven learning (DDL) for second language (L 2) written error correction, with generally positive results. However, a potential conundrum for language teachers involved in the process is how to provide feedback on students’ written production for DDL. The study looks at DDL-mediated error correction across 61 written samples submitted by 32 tertiary students during a series of short DDL courses. Teachers provided feedback on errors present in the samples, and students highlighted corrections made with or without the corpus. The results suggest that students used corpora to correct errors of word choice, word form, collocations and phrasing, but were less likely to use corpora to correct errors of deletion or morphosyntax. When the corpus was used, students were likely to successfully correct errors of collocation but were less successful for errors of morphosyntax. Post-course questionnaires suggested that perception of the usefulness of DDL for grammar learning was less than that for vocabulary and the learning of phrases, and that time and effort spent on analyzing concordance data and understanding the teacher 2 ̆ 7 s feedback on their writing were perceived as difficulties. To explore these findings further, a qualitative analysis of the feedback teachers provided suggests significant difficulties devising appropriate feedback that promotes autonomous, inductive language acquisition for all error types on the one hand, {{and at the same time}} does not eliminate the need for <b>corpus</b> <b>consultation</b> nor is too vague for students to formulate appropriate corpus queries.
