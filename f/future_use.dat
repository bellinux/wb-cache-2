5|$|Given {{that element}} 120 fills the 2f5/2 proton orbital, much {{attention}} has been given to the compound nucleus 302Ubn and its properties. Several experiments have been performed between 2000 and 2008 at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions in Dubna studying the fission characteristics of the compound nucleus 302Ubn. Two nuclear reactions have been used, namely 244Pu+58Fe and 238U+64Ni. The results have revealed how nuclei such as this fission predominantly by expelling closed shell nuclei such as 132Sn (Z=50, N=82). It was also found that the yield for the fusion-fission pathway was similar between 48Ca and 58Fe projectiles, indicating a possible <b>future</b> <b>use</b> of 58Fe projectiles in superheavy element formation.|$|E
5|$|In July 1950, {{soon after}} the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War, the Joint Chiefs of Staff decided to send ten nuclear-capable B-29 Superfortress bombers to Guam as a deterrent to a Chinese attack on Taiwan, and possible <b>future</b> <b>use</b> in Korea. They were loaded with Mark 4 nuclear bombs, but without the fissile cores. Travis was one of twenty passengers and crewmen on board B-29 Superfortress 44-87651 when it commenced take off from Fairfield-Suisun at 2200 on 5 August 1950. The plane was piloted by Captain Eugene Q. Steffes, with First Lieutenant Carter W. Johnson as his co-pilot and Technical Sergeant Donald W. Moore as his flight engineer.|$|E

5|$|A {{government}} inquiry {{was undertaken}} {{to determine the}} <b>future</b> <b>use</b> of the pipelines, and took evidence from the various stakeholders, most of whom presented the case that favored their companies or industry. The inquiry concluded that the pipelines should be sold for continued use in transporting petroleum. An auction for the pipelines was announced in 1946, {{which was designed to}} give preference to bidders who intended to use them for moving petroleum. 16 bids were received, with the highest cash bidders being companies hoping to use the pipelines for natural gas. Assessing the different bids proved difficult and the discussions became enmeshed in national politics, with companies seeking support from various Washington politicians. Meanwhile, a threatened national coal strike raised concerns over the availability of natural gas, strengthening the arguments of the natural gas lobby.|$|E
5|$|After the Kingdom of Italy {{surrendered}} to the Allies on 3 September 1943, the unfinished CB-20 was captured by German forces and completed by March 1944. The boat was then {{handed over to the}} Italian Social Republic where it saw service with the Tenth Flotilla performing reconnaissance and landing saboteurs. At some point between September and October 1944, CB-20 was relocated to its new home port in Pula, where it was captured by the Partisans on 3 May 1945. Renamed Mališan (P-901), translating as nipper in English, the boat was overhauled at the Uljanik Shipyard and commissioned in 1948. The Yugoslav Navy used it for training new submariners as well as evaluating the concept of midget submarines for <b>future</b> <b>use,</b> which eventually materialized {{in the form of the}} Una-class midget submarines three decades later. Depending on the source, the exact time Mališan was decommissioned differs from the early 1950s to 1957.|$|E

5|$|An early {{strategic}} plan by Isoroku Yamamoto involved {{the occupation of}} the western Aleutians and Midway Island as a 'decoy' to lure the United States Navy's Pacific fleet away from Pearl Harbor so as to effect the complete destruction of the Hawaiian base before reconstruction efforts could take hold. However, the Aleutians campaign meant that fewer ships could be devoted to the Battle of Midway, a turning point during World War Two. The United States armed forces had broken the Japanese communications code, {{and were able to}} learn of the Japanese plan to attack the Aleutians by May 21, 1942. The Imperial Japanese Navy's plan was to attack and hold Attu and Kiska for <b>future</b> <b>use,</b> while inflicting damage on Dutch Harbor and Adak. Once the United States Navy learned of the plan, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz sent a third of his Pacific Fleet to the Aleutian Islands, under orders to hold Dutch Harbor at all costs.|$|E
5|$|By late December 1991, {{just over}} a month after victory had been proclaimed in Vukovar, opinion polls found that 64 percent wanted {{to end the war}} {{immediately}} and only 27 percent were willing for it to continue. Milošević and other senior Serbian leaders decided against continuing the fighting, as they saw it as politically impossible to mobilise more conscripts to fight in Croatia. Desertions from the JNA continued as the well-motivated and increasingly well-equipped Croatian Army became more difficult to counter. By the end of 1991, Serbia's political and military leadership concluded that it would be counter-productive to continue the war. The looming conflict in Bosnia also required that the military resources tied up in Croatia be freed for <b>future</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the Shuttle-Mir programme, {{a series}} of American Space Shuttle {{missions}} visited Mir between 1995 and 1998 {{in preparation for the}} construction of the International Space Station. After the construction of the International Space Station began in 1998, Russian resources were split between the two stations. In 2000, Rosaviakosmos signed an agreement with MirCorp to lease the station for commercial use, with the Soyuz TM-30 mission, intended to prepare the station for <b>future</b> <b>use</b> and conduct some commercial research, being flown in later that year. This was to have been followed by more missions, including flights with space tourists, however due to the Russian government being concerned about MirCorp's ability to fund these missions, Rosaviakosmos decided against funding the continued operation of Mir.|$|E

5|$|Hawkins {{was officially}} {{selected}} by Geelong in the 2006 national draft under the father–son rule. Whilst many pundits lauded {{him as the}} best key position prospect within the draft, and felt Hawkins' junior performances warranted possible selection with the top overall pick, the father-son rules at the time only required Geelong to use a middle-tier third round pick to draft him. The subsequent controversy over what was widely acknowledged as a bargain gain for the Cats led to the AFL amending the father-son ruling for <b>future</b> <b>use.</b> With {{a reputation as one}} of the finest young tall forwards in the land, Hawkins was immediately billed as the successor to the legendary Gary Ablett, whose retirement ten years earlier had left a gaping hole in Geelongs forward line. A stress reaction injury to his right leg, however, halted Hawkins' pre-season, forcing his much-awaited debut in Geelong colours to take place in the Victorian Football League (VFL) side.|$|E
5|$|In 1642 the English Civil War {{broke out}} between the Royalist {{supporters}} of Charles I and those of Parliament. South Wales was predominantly Royalist in sympathy, and during the conflict, a sconce, or small fort, was built overlooking Caerphilly Castle to the north-west, {{on the site of}} the old Roman fort. It is uncertain if this was built by Royalist forces or by the Parliamentary army that occupied the area during the final months of the war in March 1646, but the fort's guns would have dominated the interior of the castle. It is also uncertain whether or not Caerphilly Castle was deliberately slighted by Parliament to prevent its <b>future</b> <b>use</b> as a fortification. Although several towers had collapsed by the 18th century, possibly as a result of such an operation, it is probable that this deterioration was actually the result of subsidence damage caused when the water defences retreated, as there is no evidence of deliberate destruction having been ordered.|$|E
5|$|The 8-track {{tapes of}} the three shows were {{carefully}} put in storage by Warner Bros. Japan for <b>future</b> <b>use.</b> For the album's 21st anniversary in 1993, Deep Purple author and archivist Simon Robinson decided to enquire via the band's management if the tapes could be located. He discovered the entire show had been recorded well, including all the encores. In July, Robinson and Darron Goodwin remixed the tapes at Abbey Road Studios for an expanded edition, that was then mastered by Peter Mew in September. To compromise between including {{as much of the}} shows as possible and setting a realistic price that most fans would accept, they decided to release a 3-CD box set, titled Live in Japan. This included all {{of the three}} main shows except for two tracks already available on the original album. In their place were two previously unreleased encores.|$|E

5|$|The {{locations}} are themed around {{the idea of}} a traditional Southern U.S. general store. Items used to decorate each store are authentic artifacts, including everyday objects from the early 1900s and after. Each restaurant features a front porch lined with wooden rocking chairs, a wooden peg solitaire game on every table, and a stone fireplace with a deer head displayed above the mantel. In fact, each location has five common items: a shotgun, a cookstove, a deer head, a telephone, and a traffic light. The peg games have been present in Cracker Barrel since the opening of the first store, and continue to be produced by the same family in Lebanon, Tennessee. The decor at each location typically includes artifacts related to the local history of the area, including antique household tools, old wall calendars and advertising posters, and antique photographs; these are centrally stored in a warehouse in Tennessee, where they are cataloged and stockpiled for <b>future</b> <b>use</b> by individual store locations.|$|E

It is considering using its section to store aviation fuel and as a distribution centre for motor fuel, but at a much-reduced level. In late 2009, Total UK submitted plans for the reconstruction of the oil depot. The reconstruction of the site has been taking place since March 2013.|$|E
5|$|Many royal and baronial castles {{were left}} to decline, {{so that by the}} 15th century only a few were {{maintained}} for defensive purposes. A small number of castles in England and Scotland were developed into Renaissance Era palaces that hosted lavish feasts and celebrations amid their elaborate architecture. Such structures were, however, beyond the means of all but royalty and the richest of the late-medieval barons. Although gunpowder weapons were used to defend castles from the late 14th century onwards it became clear during the 16th century that, provided artillery could be transported and brought to bear on a besieged castle, gunpowder weapons could also play an important attack role. The defences of coastal castles around the British Isles were improved to deal with this threat, but investment in their upkeep once again declined {{at the end of the}} 16th century. Nevertheless, in the widespread civil and religious conflicts across the British Isles during the 1640s and 1650s, castles played a key role in England. Modern defences were quickly built alongside existing medieval fortifications and, in many cases, castles successfully withstood more than one siege. In Ireland the introduction of heavy siege artillery by Oliver Cromwell in 1649 brought a rapid end to the utility of castles in the war, while in Scotland the popular tower houses proved unsuitable for defending against civil war artillery– although major castles such as Edinburgh put up strong resistance. At the end of the war many castles were slighted to prevent <b>future</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E
