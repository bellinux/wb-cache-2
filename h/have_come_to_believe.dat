According to this now-established account, one of Khánh's men took Nhung to the garden of a Saigon villa and forced him to kneel, before executing him with a single gunshot {{to the back of}} the head. Nhung's death led to protests among the Saigon public, who took the killing to be a signal that the remaining members of Diệm's regime would be reinstated to positions of authority.|$|E
5|$|Theobald {{also became}} embroiled {{in the dispute}} between Hilary, the Bishop of Chichester, and Walter de Lucy, the abbot of Battle Abbey, over Hilary's claims to {{jurisdiction}} over the abbey and the abbey's counter-claims that it was exempt from episcopal supervision. The abbey had never received a papal exemption, but relied instead on its royal foundation by King William I of England and its status as an eigenkirche, or proprietary church of the king. Under King Stephen, the abbey's claims prevailed, but after Stephen's death Hilary excommunicated the abbot, who appealed to the papacy. Theobald supported the bishop, who eventually secured a trial before King Henry II. It was a minor setback for Theobald when the case was eventually decided in Battle's favour, mainly {{on the basis of}} charters that were thought at the time to be genuine, but modern historians <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> were forged.|$|E

25|$|As time progressed, the Seminole and Blacks {{had limited}} intermarriage; but historians and anthropologists <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that {{generally}} the Black Seminoles had independent communities. They {{allied with the}} Seminole at times of war. The Seminole society {{was based on a}} matrilineal kinship system, in which inheritance and descent went through the maternal line. Children were considered to belong to the mother's clan, so those born to ethnic African mothers would have been considered black by the Seminole. While the children might integrate customs from both parents' cultures, the Seminole believed they belonged to the mother's group more than the father's.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, many {{researchers}} <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that one variant of the northeastern Iberian script, the older one according to the archaeological contexts, distinguished voicing in the plosives by adding a stroke to the glyphs for the alveolar (/d/~/t/) and velar (/g/~/k/) syllables, creating distinct glyphs for unvoiced /t/ and /k/, and restricting the original glyphs to voiced /d/ and /g/. (This is the so-called dual signary model: see northeastern Iberian script.) If correct, this innovation would parallel {{the creation of the}} Latin letter G by the addition of a stroke to C, which had previously stood for both /k/ and /g/.|$|E

25|$|As of the 21st century, the Bnei Menashe <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> {{that the}} legendary Kuki-Mizo {{ancestor}} Manmasi was the Hebrew Menasseh, son of Joseph. This group of Chin-Kuki-Mizo people began a Messianic movement during the 1950s. While believing that Y'shua (Jesus) is the promised messiah for all Israelites, these pioneers {{in the early}} 1960s adopted observance of the Jewish Sabbath, holidays, dietary laws and other Jewish customs and traditions which they learned from books. They had no connections with other Jewish groups in the diaspora or in Israel. On May 31, 1972, some Messianic communities founded the Manipur Jewish Organization (later renamed United Jews Organization, NEI), the first Jewish organization in northeast India.|$|E

The Gunslingers free the Breakers from their captors, but Eddie is wounded after the battle and dies a short while later. Roland and Jake pause to mourn and then jump to Maine of 1999 along with Oy, in order {{to save the life of}} Stephen King (whom he writes to be an omniscient secondary character in the book); the ka-tet <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that the success of their quest depends on King surviving to write about it through his books.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} spring, Cu Roi and Murgen (two of The Nine) {{take four}} thousand men into occupied eastern territory {{to try to}} gain {{the support of the}} Forest Giants. They agree to join the Light, but Soulblighter (Balor's chief lieutenant) springs a surprise attack, trapping The Legion within the Tain; an artifact small enough to hold in one's hand, but which contains a pocket universe of limitless capacity. A group of fifty men led by Murgen find the battle standard of the long-dead Myrkridia, and shortly thereafter, Murgen finds a secret exit. He is able to open it, {{but the rest of the}} four thousand men are lost, as is Cu Roi, whilst Murgen is killed as he destroys the Tain. Shocked at their escape, Soulblighter flees, but news soon arrives that Maeldun has lost Bagrada, and The Deceiver has crossed west. Also, when the remainder of The Nine tried to destroy the Head, which they <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> has been betraying them, they were prevented from doing so by the army, with two of The Nine killed in the ensuing conflict. Meanwhile, Alric joins The Legion.|$|E

The song includes references to enemies chasing the people over a red-coloured sea, quails, and a pillar of cloud. Such images and symbols are not exclusive to Judaism.|$|E
