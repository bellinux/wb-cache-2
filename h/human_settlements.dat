5|$|Although the {{parasite}} responsible for P.falciparum malaria {{has been in}} existence for 50,000–100,000 years, the population size of {{the parasite}} did not increase until about 10,000 years ago, concurrently with advances in agriculture {{and the development of}} <b>human</b> <b>settlements.</b> Close relatives of the human malaria parasites remain common in chimpanzees. Some evidence suggests that the P.falciparum malaria may have originated in gorillas.|$|E
5|$|Extensive {{deforestation}} {{has resulted}} in loss of trees such as acacias, baobab, dates and palm trees. This has also caused loss of natural habitat for wild animals; {{one of the main}} reasons for this is also hunting and livestock farming by increasing <b>human</b> <b>settlements.</b> Populations of animals like lions, leopards and rhino have fallen significantly.|$|E
40|$|Increasing Chinese {{urbanization}} and industrialization {{has prompted}} {{greater attention to}} the study of <b>human</b> <b>settlement</b> and the human-land relationship in the fields of geography, architecture, and urban planning. We used bibliometric methods and statistical software to review 180 articles on <b>human</b> <b>settlement</b> in 16 Chinese geographical journals. We found that Chinese geographical <b>human</b> <b>settlement</b> research is characterized by the following: (1) Most research focuses on <b>human</b> <b>settlement</b> extension, valuation indicators, models for urban and rural settlements, theoretical exploration and the planning practices of single-factor, <b>human</b> <b>settlement</b> and complex, geographical livability in macro-scale, urban settlement differentiation and ideal patterns in medium scale, the comprehensive evaluation of settlement environment, and the planning of community units in micro-scale, community settlements; socio-cultural investigation and warnings about advancing <b>human</b> <b>settlement.</b> (2) No {{progress has been made in}} synthesizing and integrating method systems. PSR models and DPSIR models are used for targeting mechanisms, while the standard settlement evaluation system was composed of physical & economic indicators by questionnaire surveys. On the other hand, spatial clustering based on GIS has been a frequent focus in recent years. Pioneering research on <b>human</b> <b>settlement</b> and theoretical systems within the context of China's urbanization and industrialization will provide guidance on the sustainability of Chinese cities and regions. The following five aspects require greater attention: (1) Natural suitability research on <b>human</b> <b>settlement,</b> and a survey of <b>human</b> <b>settlement</b> demands to reflect the range of different demands concerning ecologically suitable settlements in urban environments, the corresponding valuation indicators, systems, and evolution, and the impact of the residents' socio-economic attributes. (2) Spatial-temporal evaluation and sustainability research on urban and rural <b>human</b> <b>settlement</b> at various scales, focusing on evolution and spatial differentiation at various scales such as city clusters and comparisons between cities, within the cities and communities. (3) Development of theory and technology for <b>human</b> <b>settlement</b> evolution research, including detection technology and methods, data mining measures, and forecasting and emulation of regional and urban <b>human</b> <b>settlement</b> evolution processes, mechanisms and patterns. (4) Research on the control of <b>human</b> <b>settlement</b> that focuses on optimization, patterns, and policies for effective management and development. (5) Estimating the <b>human</b> <b>settlement</b> system service value and establishing suitable <b>human</b> <b>settlement</b> systems, including social, economic, cultural and ecological service values...|$|R

5|$|Addax {{are easy}} to hunt due to their slow movements. Roadkill, {{firearms}} for easy hunting and nomadic settlements near waterholes (their dry-season feeding places) have also decreased numbers. Moreover, their meat and leather are highly prized. Other threats include chronic droughts in the deserts, habitat destruction due to more <b>human</b> <b>settlements</b> and agriculture.

5|$|Because of its numbers, ubiquity, and {{association}} with <b>human</b> <b>settlements,</b> the house sparrow is culturally prominent. It is extensively, and usually unsuccessfully, persecuted as an agricultural pest. It has also often been kept as a pet, {{as well as}} being a food item and a symbol of lust, sexual potency, commonness, and vulgarity. Though it is widespread and abundant, its numbers have declined in some areas. The animal's conservation status is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{archaeological evidence}} for the domestication of the horse comes from sites in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, dating to approximately 3500–4000 BC.

5|$|<b>Human</b> <b>settlements</b> on Polish lands {{occurred}} {{later than}} in the more climatically hospitable regions of southern and western Europe and were dependent on the recurring episodes of glaciation. Gatherer-hunter Homo erectus campsites, together with their inhabitants' primitive stone tools (choppers and microliths), bones of the large mammals they hunted and the fish they caught, were found below the San River glaciation period sediments in Trzebnica and are about 500,000 years old. Younger sites related to the same species were found at Rusko near Strzegom, located, like Trzebnica, in the Lower Silesia region. This represents the microlithic complexes of the Lower Paleolithic period. Homo erectus, earlier known as Pithecanthropus erectus, was a species of early humans.|$|E
