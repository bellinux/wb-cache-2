500|$|In February 1995, {{two months}} after the release of Star Trek Generations, Paramount decided to produce another Star Trek feature for a winter holiday 1996 release. Paramount wanted writers Brannon Braga and Ronald D. Moore, who had written the Generations script and a number of Next Generation episodes, to pen the screenplay. Producer Rick Berman told Braga and Moore that he wanted them to think about <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> {{involving}} time travel. Braga and Moore, meanwhile, wanted to use the Borg. [...] "Right on the spot, we said maybe we can do both, the Borg and time travel," [...] Moore recalled. The Borg had not been seen in full force since the fourth-season episode of The Next Generation, [...] "", and had never been heavily featured in the series due to budget constraints and the fear that they would lose their scare factor. [...] "The Borg were really liked by the fans, and we liked them," [...] Moore said. [...] "They were fearsome. They were unstoppable. Perfect foils for a feature story." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first story}} arc of The Fearless Defenders {{came to a}} close with issue #6 in July 2013. Bunn said, [...] "The first arc has {{definitely}} been very Asgardian. That's just the nature of <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about Valkyrie. As we go into the next arc, I take the opportunity to show that there are stories for this team in any number of environments... Issues #7-#12, while they tell a complete story, we're going to do a series of done-in-one stories with those issues. Each of those issues will be pretty good jumping-on points for anybody." [...] Issue #6 also featured the death of Annabelle Riggs, who Newsarama called [...] "one of Marvel's few prominent lesbian characters", which drew a strong reaction from fans. In response Bunn wrote, [...] "the fact that she was a lesbian didn’t even enter the equation for me, except that it was part of what made her who she was — just one part of many" [...] with Pyle adding, [...] "I feel very strongly that her sacrifice was very true to everything we love about her. As to whether {{the fact that she is}} a lesbian should have kept us from telling a story in which she died… in this particular case, not having this specific character sacrifice herself would have made for a story in which we were less emotionally invested." ...|$|E

2500|$|Filming {{began at}} the Cinecittà studio in Rome again in mid-May 1966, {{including}} the opening scene between Eastwood and Wallach when Blondie captures Tuco {{for the first time}} and sends him to jail. The production then moved on to Spain's plateau region near Burgos in the north, which doubled for the southwestern United States, and again shot the western scenes in Almería in the south. This time, the production required more elaborate sets, including a town under cannon fire, an extensive prison camp and an American Civil War battlefield; and for the climax, several hundred Spanish soldiers were employed to build a cemetery with several thousand grave stones to resemble an ancient Roman circus. For the scene where the bridge was blown up, it had to be filmed twice as in the first take all three cameras were destroyed by the explosion. Eastwood remembers, [...] "They would care if you were <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about Spaniards and about Spain. Then they'd scrutinize you very tough, but the fact that you're doing a western that's supposed to be laid in southwest America or Mexico, they couldn't care less what your story or subject is." [...] Top Italian cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli was brought in to shoot the film and was prompted by Leone to pay more attention to light than in the previous two films; Ennio Morricone composed the score once again. Leone was instrumental in asking Morricone to compose a track for the final Mexican stand-off scene in the cemetery, asking him to compose what felt like [...] "the corpses were laughing from inside their tombs", and asked Delli Colli to create a hypnotic whirling effect interspersed with dramatic extreme close ups, to give the audience the impression of a visual ballet. Filming concluded in July 1966.|$|E
