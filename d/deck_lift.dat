25|$|Following {{relaxation}} {{of some of}} the specifications requirements, Blackburn constructed a second aircraft as a private venture, with a watertight metal monocoque fuselage replacing the previous steel tube fuselage, this first flying on 24 February 1933. Because it was a private venture it received and carried the Blackburn Class B civil test marking B-3 and was referred to as such, though it was also known as the M.1/30A. It performed poorly during testing, still being incapable of meeting the performance requirements of the specification even though they had been relaxed, and being too heavy for the carrier <b>deck</b> <b>lifts.</b> As none of the competitors for the specification could meet its requirements, the specification was cancelled, with no aircraft being ordered.|$|R

50|$|On January 10, 2016, the new {{bridge was}} closed to traffic after an {{expansion}} joint on the <b>deck</b> was <b>lifted</b> by 60 cm after a winter storm, resulting in the indefinite closure of the Trans-Canada Highway at the bridge. As the bridge is a {{single point of failure}} in Canada's National Highway System, its closure effectively required vehicles travelling between Eastern and Western Canada to detour through the United States.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. This thesis is submitted for the degree of Doctor of Engineering in Environmental Technology. The degree is awarded for industrially relevant research, based in industry, and supported by a programme of development courses. This project aims {{to contribute to a}} reduction in the environmental burdens of vertical transportation systems. The author has carried out an environmental assessment showing that the dominating environmental burdens of vertical transportation systems arise from their use of electricity while in operation in buildings. An assessment of traffic demand has concluded that we are probably over-sizing lifts, and are therefore installing systems that consume more energy than necessary. Traffic planning techniques for single and double <b>deck</b> <b>lifts</b> have been reviewed and developed. The kinematics (motion) of lifts has been studied. New formulae have been derived that allow us to plot travel profiles for any input of journey distance, maximum velocity, maximum acceleration and maximum jerk. Taking these journey profiles as inputs, a mathematical model of a DC Static Converter Drive has been developed. The model can be used to calculate the energy consumption of any individual lift trip. A lift simulation program has been developed. The program uses the research in traffic, kinematics and motor modelling as a basis for developing energy saving lift control strategies.
