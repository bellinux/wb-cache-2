Pöchhacker 2004 and Angelelli and Jacobson 2009) there is a clear need for both more research and for sharing detailed systematic information on methods of test administration and assessing processes and products. This paper then describes the present procedures at Lessius University College with regard to the assessment of students at completion of community <b>interpreting</b> <b>training.</b> At the time of writing, the curriculum, our Department is undergoing some important changes and these developments offer opportunities to re-think some aspects of our training, curriculum and hence assessment procedures. Re-thinking assessment procedures involves relating theoretical concepts to practice. Engaged in this task, we agree with Leeson (2008) who states that assessment is a highly complex issue and designing successful interpreting tests means qualifying for the Olympic team. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper will}} offer {{a summary of the}} tools and {{techniques}} that were used for a <b>Training</b> and <b>Documentation</b> Needs Assessment Study recently completed by the Information Technology Services (ITS) division at Ithaca College, located in Ithaca, New York. The structure, design, and tools of this study provide a model for user support professionals and others within information technology service organizations at higher education institutions to adopt to carry out a needs assessment study with users on their own campuses. Ithaca College provides centralized user support services, such as <b>training</b> and <b>documentation,</b> through ITS. The goal of the ITS <b>Training</b> and <b>Documentation</b> Needs Assessment Study was to obtain feedback from faculty, staff, and students on current <b>training</b> and <b>documentation</b> services delivered by ITS (Information Technology Services), as well as to gather ideas for adding to, modifying, and improving these services in the future. Three standard communications research tools were employed to complete this study: focus groups, interviews, and a survey. Results from these data collection instruments were analyzed into a report on responses across and within the three target populations (faculty, staff, and students). Moreover, these results were synthesized into a set of recommendations, which are being used to shape the delivery of <b>training</b> and <b>documentation</b> services to the campus community...|$|R
