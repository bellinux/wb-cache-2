25|$|The rationalist {{notion that}} all {{law should be}} {{condensed}} and comprehensively written in a code was challenged by social, economic and political mutations which imposed a need for the text to be constantly updated.

25|$|It is {{not normal}} for test results {{to give a}} base-by base list of results.

25|$|The numerator, n−p, is the {{statistical}} degrees of freedom. The first quantity, s2, is the OLS estimate for σ2, whereas the second, , is the MLE estimate for σ2.

In practice s2 is used more often, since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>convenient</b> for the hypothesis testing. The square root of s2 is called the standard error of the regression (SER), or standard error of the equation (SEE).|$|E

25|$|For the consumer, channel {{switching}} offers {{a more diverse}} shopping experience. However, marketers need to be alert to {{channel switching}} because of its potential to erode market share. Evidence of channel switching can suggest that disruptive forces are at play, and that consumer behaviour is undergoing fundamental changes. A consumer may be prompted to switch channels when the product or service can be found cheaper, when superior models become available, when a wider range is offered, or simply because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>convenient</b> to shop through a different channel (e.g. online or one-stop shopping). As a hedge against market share losses due to switching behaviour, some retailers engage in multi-channel retailing.|$|E
25|$|In {{a series}} of papers with several authors, Atiyah {{classified}} all instantons on 4-dimensional Euclidean space. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>convenient</b> to classify instantons on a sphere as this is compact, and this is essentially equivalent to classifying instantons on Euclidean space as this is conformally equivalent to a sphere and the equations for instantons are conformally invariant. With Hitchin and Singer he calculated the dimension of the moduli space of irreducible self-dual connections (instantons) for any principal bundle over a compact 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold (the Atiyah–Hitchin–Singer theorem). For example, the dimension of the space of SU2 instantons of rank k>0 is 8k−3. To do this they used the Atiyah–Singer index theorem to calculate the dimension of the tangent space of the moduli space at a point; the tangent space is essentially the space of solutions of an elliptic differential operator, given by the linearization of the non-linear Yang–Mills equations. These moduli spaces were later used by Donaldson to construct his invariants of 4-manifolds.|$|E
