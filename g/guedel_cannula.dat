30|$|While the {{endotracheal tube}} was in place, ulcerations {{caused by the}} tube or the {{fastening}} system were more frequent in the OTI group [lips ulcerations, n =  27 (30 %) versus nostrils ulcerations in the NTI group, n =  6 (13 %) (p <  0.05)]. Tube repositioning was required in 22 % of patients in the OTI group versus 11 % in the NTI group (p =  0, 1) while self extubation was observed in 3 patients in each group (p =  0.4). Ventilator-associated pneumonia occurred in 4 % in OTI and 7.5 % NTI (p =  0.69). Other infectious complications were one sinusitis in the NTI group (p =  0.34) and 3 labial herpes in the OTI group (p =  0.55). <b>Guedel</b> <b>cannula</b> was used only in the OTI group (9 vs 0 %, p = . 05).|$|E
40|$|Bariatric surgery {{has become}} an {{integral}} part of morbid obesity treatment with well-defined indications. Some complications, specific or not, due to laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) procedure have recently been described. We report a rare complication unpublished to date: a nasogastric section during great gastric curve stapling. A 44 -year-old woman suffered of severe obesity (BMI 36. 6 kg/m 2) with failure of medical treatments for years. According to already published technique, a LSG was performed. Six hours postoperatively, a nurse removed the nasogastric tube according to the local protocol and the nasogastric tube was abnormally short, with staples at its extremity. Surgery was performed with peroperative endoscopy. In conclusion, this is the first publication of a nasogastric section during LSG. Therefore we report this case and propose a solution to prevent its occurrence. To avoid this kind of accident, we now systematically insert the nasogastric tube by mouth through a <b>Guedel</b> <b>cannula.</b> Then, to insert the calibrating bougie, we entirely withdraw the nasogastric tube...|$|E
