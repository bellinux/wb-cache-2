40|$|Eight healthy {{young adult}} males {{seated in a}} rigid chair and {{restrained}} by a five point <b>harness</b> <b>belt</b> underwent anterior-posterior random appearing multisine perturbations with a frequency range of 0. 3 - 20 Hz. Six different conditions were tested differentiating in maximum acceleration level ([1; 2; 4; 8] m/s²) and in task (mental arithmetic and blindfolded). The head and neck kinematics were captured by a Qualisys motion capture system and Xsens accelerometers. Muscle activity of the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles was collected by a Delsys EMG system. A two pivot neck model was developed representing the head-neck kinematics separating upper and lower neck kinematics. The kinematics were described with an error margin of 2. 5 % of the maximum range of motion of the head. The amount of neck deformation relative to the perturbation is expressed in gain and phase, the linearity is expressed in squared coherence. For the head-neck kinematics a significant (P < 0. 05) increase in gain was found for decreasing acceleration levels, indicating non-linearity of the human reflexes and/or the passive neck mechanics. At lower frequencies, the mental arithmetic task resulted in a 9 % decrease of neck deformations (P < 0. 01). At lower frequencies, blindfolding resulted in a 16 % increase of neck deformations (P < 0. 05). The pivot rotations showed for low acceleration levels similar gain and phase characteristics for both {{the upper and lower}} pivot up to 3 Hz. Increasing acceleration levels resulted in a major decrease of relative upper neck deformations (P < 0. 05) and an increase of relative lower neck deformations (P < 0. 01), suggesting different control strategies for both pivots. For frequencies above approximately 5 Hz an increasing phase lag up to 180 º for the upper pivot with respect to the lower pivot is found, indicating C-shaped neck bending for low frequencies and S-shaped neck bending for high frequencies. With the exception of the upper pivot response the squared coherence showed globally values above 0. 5 between 1 - 12 Hz. BMechEMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|Prostor obrađen u okviru doktorskog rada obuhvaća međurječje Krke i Cetine u razdoblju principata. Okosnicu rada čini tipološko-kronološka obrada rimske vojne opreme temeljem koje se dolazi do potvrde i dopune već poznatih činjenica izvedenih uglavnom iz povijesnih izvora i natpisa. Sustavnom obradom vojne opreme pojašnjavaju se međusobni odnosi vojnih i civilnih lokaliteta unutar regije, kao i odnos obrađene regije s ostalim dijelovima Rimskog Carstva. U radnji su obrađeni nalazi rimske vojne opreme prikupljeni iz više muzejskih institucija: Arheološki muzej u Splitu, Arheološki muzej u Zagrebu, Muzej cetinske krajine u Sinju i Muzej triljskog kraja u Trilju. Ukupno je obrađeno 486 predmeta, od čega je 46 određeno kao oružje, zaštitnoj opremi pripada 39 predmeta, a konjskoj 89. Najbrojnija je skupina osobne opreme sa 283 obrađena nalaza, a kao ostala oprema obrađeno ih je ukupno 29. U poglavlju Tipološko – kronološka analiza predmeti su obrađeni u tipološkim skupinama bez obzira na lokalitet s kojeg potječu, te je fokus na postavljanju, uz namjenske i tipološke i vremenskih okvira nalaza. U Zaključnim razmatranjima smo usporedili zastupljenost rimske vojne opreme na pojedinim nalazištima, te izdvojili datacijske okvire materijala obzirom na lokalitet nalaza. Od ukupnog broja od 486 nalaza čak 476 pronađeno je na području Tilurija i Salone, a na svim ostalim lokalitetima 9 (sl. 34). Od tog je broja najveći broj nalaza, ukupno pet, iz Andetrija, dva su pronađena u Podgrađu kod Podstrane u Poljicima, a s po jednim nalazom zastupljeni su Balina glavica kod Umljanovića, Čaporice kod Trilja i Prugovo (kat. br. 153) koje se nalazi na cestovnom pravcu od Klisa prema Muću (karta 2). Usporedba nalaza iz Tilurija i Salone pokazala je na oba lokaliteta najbolju zastupljenost materijala iz razdoblja 1. st., no za razliku od gotovo potpunog izostanka nalaza 2. i 3. st. u Tiluriju, u Saloni je tako datiran materijal zastupljen u tek nešto manjem broju od onog iz 1. st. (sl. 37). U Tiluriju su potvrđeni nalazi iz kasnorepublikanskog/ranoaugustovskog doba čime je po prvi put u sloju potvrđena ta faza logora. Materijal tog vremena nije zabilježen na području Salone. U Andetriju je oprema zastupljena s pet predmeta iz razdoblja od 1. do 3. st., a nalazi iz u Prugova, Čaporica i Baline glavice pripadaju 1. st. U Podgrađu su pojasna kopča i privjesak datirana u 1. st., s tim da privjesak pripada tipu kakvi se javljaju i početkom 2. st. The {{geographical}} territory covered {{within the}} framework of this doctoral dissertation encompasses the interfluve of the Krka and Cetina Rivers, an area which {{during the time of the}} Roman conquests was inhabited by the Delmataean (Delmati) tribe, who fiercely resisted Roman military might. The time covered is the period of the Principate (27 BC – 284 AD), from the ascension of Emperor Augustus to the throne to the reign of Emperor Diocletian and the establishment of the Dominate, i. e., from the final quarter of the first century BC to the end of the third century AD, which encompasses the period of subjugation of the indigenous populations, Romanization and the permanent establishment of Roman power in this region. The foundation of this work is a typological/chronological analysis of Roman military equipment, which is used as the basis for verification and supplementation of facts already known mainly from historical sources, and new insights tied to the Roman conquest of the aforementioned section of the Roman Empire in the territorial, administrative and also civilisational sense. The systematic analysis of military equipment is used to explain mutual relations between military and civilian sites within the region, as well as the relationship between this region and other parts of the Roman Empire. This work consists of an analysis of finds of Roman military equipment from several museum institutions: the Archaeological Museum in Split, the Archaeological Museum in Zagreb, the Cetina Regional Museum in Sinj and the Trilj Local Heritage Museum in Trilj. The finds are divided into five basic categories: weapons, protective equipment, equine equipment, personal accessories and other equipment, which are further sub-divided into subcategories. A total of 486 items are processed, of which 46 were classified as weapons, 39 as protective equipment, and 89 as riding equipment. The most numerous group is personal accessories, with a total of 283 finds, and a total of 29 items were examined as other equipment. In the chapter “Typological-chronological analysis,” the artefacts are analysed within their typological groups regardless of the site from which they originated, and the focus is on setting a chronological framework for the finds in addition to their use and type. Six categories of weapons are present in the total number of 46 exponents (Fig. 2). Pieces of swords and daggers are close-quarter weapons, while the ranged weapons include ballistic projectiles, plumbatae, bows and arrows and spears, although the latter were both thrown and used in close-quarter combat, particularly when the spearheads were larger and heavier. The highest number of these items, twelve, belong to the spear category, although most, with eight examples, are actually butts. Ten tips have been set aside in the javelin and ballistic projectiles group. Bows and arrows underwent particular analysis. Three bone reinforcements belong to the category of composite bows, while five arrowheads can be classified into two basic types; three are trilobe arrowheads, while two are flat-headed (leaf-shaped). Among the swords, the Mainz and Pompeii types, and cavalry spathae have been preserved, while in the dagger category, besides a link for a sheath and two rivets, an almost entirely preserved dagger in its sheath was found in the bed of the Cetina River in Trilj. With the exception of a single javelin tip from Andetrium, all of the finds in the group are from Tilurium and Salona. All of the weapons that could be dated more precisely to the Roman period can be placed {{within the framework}} of the 1 st century, with the exception of two butts which appeared during the 1 st century, but which had a longer duration of use (Fig. 6). Protective equipment encompasses a total of 39 components of armour, helmets and shields. With only three finds, one cheek-piece and two plume holders, helmets are least represented. These are all components of the Weisenau helmet. Two armour types are present: chainmail, to which four pieces belong (three fastening hooks and an armour fragment consisting of five chain-links), and Corbridge segmented armour, to which the most items belong (two fastening loops, six strap fittings, five armour belt mounts, thirteen buckle components). Six items (one rivet and umbo fragment, three pieces of outer rim reinforcements and part of a handle) have been distinguished as shield parts. Most finds, 31 in all, are by far from Tilurium, six are from Salona, and two finds indentified as protective equipment are from Andetrium. Materials that appeared during the first century largely prevail, with a small number of items having a longer duration through the 2 nd and also 3 rd century (Fig. 11). Equine equipment, divided into several groups, consists of 89 items. The most numerous group consists of riding harness pendants, of which there are 58, and they account for two thirds of the equine equipment finds. The pendants are further sub-divided into ten different types, which have mainly been dated to the 1 st century (Fig. 12). Besides pendants, the standard components of harnesses were found, such as different types of connecting hooks, belt catches and mounts, which are the most numerous (Fig. 14). The parts of equestrian parade equipment stand out in terms of quality of craftsmanship: a blinder and saddle strap mount; the rather luxurious lunular and three-piece foliate riding harness pendants may have also belonged to parade equipment. With the exception of a single <b>harness</b> <b>belt</b> catch, from Prugovo, all of the finds fare from Tilurium and Salona (Fig. 15). Generally this is equipment that has been dated to the 1 st century, with the exception of the mounts, mainly from Salona, which have been dated to the 2 nd and early 3 rd century (Fig. 21). The personal soldier equipment include parts of military belts and aprons, and hobnails used to reinforce marching boots (caligae). As belt components, 94 items of various uses were distinguished and divided into eight basic groups (Fig. 22). As in the case of the overall materials, finds from Tilurium and Salona (Fig. 3) also predominate here. The hobnails for crafting marching boots, 205 in all, were classified on the basis of the stamp on the lower side of the head, and all of them were found during archaeological excavations in the Tilurium military camp (Fig. 24). The hobnails consisting of ribs and semi-spherical protrusions have been dated to the Late Republic/Early Augustan era, while those with a row of small balls along the edge but otherwise unadorned have been dated from the end of the 1 st century BC to the end of the 1 st century AD, since caligae fell out of use by the end of the 1 st century and at the beginning of the 2 nd century. Later-phase hobnails whose appearance has been set at the second decade of the 1 st century BC are more numerous than those from the earlier phase, while unadorned hobnails are the most numerous (Fig. 24). The chronological framework for the personal accessories category shows that this is the group that contains the earliest materials thanks to the finds of hobnails for caligae, and this group also contains the best representation of items dated to the 2 nd and 3 rd centuries, if compared to the remaining categories of equipment (Fig. 29). The group of other equipment includes buttons with eyeholes and pickaxes (dolabrae) which generally date to the 1 st century (Fig. 30, 31). In the Concluding Considerations, I compare the presence of Roman military equipment at individual sites, and determined dating frameworks given the find sites. Out of the total number of 486 finds, as many as 476 were found in the areas of Tilurium and Salona, and 9 and all other sites (Fig. 34). Out of that latter number, most of the finds, five, are from Andetrium, two were found in Podgrađe, at Podstrana in Poljice, and one each is from Balina glavica, at Umljanović, Čaporice, near Trilj, and Prugovo (cat. no. 153), which is situated on the road from Klis to Muć (map 2). A comparison of the finds from Tilurium and Salona has shown that at both sites materials from the 1 st century are best represented, but as opposed to the virtually complete absence of 2 nd and 3 rd century finds at Tilurium, at Salona the materials so dated are only slightly less numerous than the materials from the 1 st century (Fig. 37). In Tilurium, finds from the Late Republic/Early Augustan era have been confirmed, which is the first time this phase of the camp has been ascertained in a layer. The materials from this period were not recorded in the area of Salona. In Andetrium, five items ranging from the 1 st to 3 rd century were found, while in Prugovo, Čaporice and Balina glavica, the finds date to the 1 st century. In Podgrađe, the belt buckle and pendant have been dated to the 1 st century, although the pendant belongs to a type that appeared at the beginning of the 2 nd century. The highest quantity of finds is from the 1 st century, when the military was the most numerous in the province of Dalmatia, and its encompasses a period of warfare, camp construction and the residence of legions in them. At the end of the 1 st century, legionary units departed from Dalmatia, and security was provided by auxiliary units. The reduced number of military formations in the 2 nd and 3 rd century resulted in a lower quantity of equipment, except in Salona, in which members of the military stayed throughout the Principate, either performing various services or living as veterans. In this study, some questions remain unresolved, although thanks precisely to this study they have actually been defined. In the first place, this pertains to the question of military equipment from the period after the 1 st century in the area of the Tilurium military camp, and to the absence of finds from Salona in the Early Augustan period. The typological/chronological analysis of the finds not only serves as a platform for further research, it also sets forth the guidelines for future work...|$|E

Attaching the harness as soon as the hunter is in the tree keeps the hunter safe while setting up for the hunt. The strap between the harness and strap around the tree should be long enough to allow the hunter to move a little and short enough so if the hunter falls they do not fall too far.|$|R

50|$|Compared to scuba, snuba divers wear minimal gear. Each diver is {{equipped}} with a mask, fins, weight <b>belt,</b> <b>harness</b> and regulator. The harness holds the regulator and air line in place, allowing the diver to swim unencumbered beneath the surface. This may be compared to full scuba gear, which includes a buoyancy compensator, weights, cylinder and often more, and can weigh in excess of 27 kg. Although scuba equipment is nearly weightless underwater, out of the water the weight becomes a significant factor for weaker individuals. Unlike scuba divers, the snuba diver is not provided with an emergency buoyancy system, meaning that in case of emergency the snuba diver must reach the surface himself or await the arrival of assistance. On the other hand, a correctly weighted snuba diver will be neutrally buoyant at all depths (no compressible dive suit), has a hose and harness to prevent sinking, can pull on the hose to surface, which is less effort than swimming, and has a raft with a grab-rope to hold on to at the surface.|$|R

40|$|Copyright © 2003 SAE International Computational {{modeling}} {{continues to}} play an increasingly {{significant role in the}} design of more effective vehicle crash safety systems. Models configured with sophisticated computer analyses permit researchers to perform extensive “what-if? ” exploratory studies {{at a fraction of the}} cost and time that would be required by physical testing alone. Presently, our research team is developing a modeling and analysis capability that will provide child restraint system (CRS) engineers, designers, and analysts a validation tool that will supplement conventional engineering results attained from sled testing, which is often timely and costly. Supplementing these physical tests and digital modeling capabilities is the newly developed NYSCEDII CRS Visualization Module (NCVM), which allows a user to immersively visualize the MADYMO-calculated automotive crash simulation imagery. Depicted are the motion of, and interactions between, the CRS shell, human “dummy”, <b>harness</b> and latch <b>belt</b> assemblies, and applicable vehicle cabin-interior surfaces and structure; and nodal finite element Von Mises color stress contours for the CRS shell and its attendant restraint straps. Supplemental NCVM features include: plotted instantaneous body segment acceleration-time responses; dummy displacements visually tracked using on-screen reference markers- to be tracked as a function of time; forwards or backwards animation capability; and stereo viewing, using anaglyphic stereo, to convey a sense of depth and immersion. This paper demonstrates the utility of the NCVM using a combination conventional/finite element system model of a recent-production child restraint system (CRS) and its three-year-old dummy occupant in a modified FMVSS 213 sled test environment...|$|R
40|$|This study reviews trends, rear facing, {{top tether}} use, and seating {{position}} for {{children younger than}} 13 y among motor vehicle passengers in Indiana. This is an observational, cross-sectional survey of drivers transporting children 15 years and younger and drivers collected at 25 convenience locations randomly selected in Indiana during summers 2005 through 2010. Observations were conducted by Certified Child Passenger Safety Technicians (CPST). As the driver completed a written survey collecting demographic data on the driver and children, the CPST recorded the vehicle seating location, the type of restraint, direction the car safety seat (CSS) was facing, {{and use of the}} CSS <b>harness</b> or safety <b>belt</b> as appropriate. Data was analyzed for infants younger than twelve months, children in forward facing CSS, and children < 13 y. Between 2005 and 2010, 514 infants (age < 12 m) were observed in motor vehicles. On average 83. 5 % (SD 4. 8 %) of the infants were rear facing. The percent of infants rear facing was 75. 5 % during 2005 and rose to 88. 9 % during 2010. Of the 442 vehicles observed with a forward facing car seat, 58 % (SD 16. 5 %) had the top tether attached. In our sample, more than 88. 7 % (SD 0. 8 %) children < 13 y were seated in a rear seat vehicle position. Driver variables affecting occupant protection are discussed. This information can be used by primary care providers and child passenger safety technicians and other child passenger safety advocates to develop counseling points and educational campaigns...|$|R

Models configured with sophisticated computer analyses such as Madymo permit researchers to perform extensive “what if? ” and other exploratory studies {{at a fraction of the}} cost and time that would be required by means of physical testing alone. However, fully understanding and correctly interpreting the results generated by complex crash simulations is often an inherently difficult task, despite the availability of high-caliber, multi-perspective post-processing code imagery. The NYSCEDII CRS Visualization Module (NCVM) serves as a potentially useful 3 -D, fully integrated add-on component to the Madymo dynamics analysis software. This paper demonstrates the utility of the NCVM using a combination conventional/finite element system model of a recent-production child restraint system (CRS) and its three-year-old dummy occupant in a modified FMVSS 213 sled test environment. Primarily, the NCVM allows the user to immersively visualize, at every time step of the simulation, the Madymo-calculated imagery depicting: (1) the motion of, and interactions between, the CRS shell, human “dummy”, <b>harness</b> and latch <b>belt</b> assemblies, and applicable vehicle cabin-interior surfaces and structure; and (2) nodal finite element Von Mises color stress contours for the CRS shell and its attendant restraint straps. Supplementary NCVM features include the following: (a) instantaneous body segment acceleration-time responses which can be depicted using an on-screen plotting utility; (b) on-screen reference markers which enable selected dummy displacements to be tracked as a function of time; (c) the simulation is viewable as either a forward-continuous animation or- to better understand localized displacements- frame by frame, forwards or backwards; and (d) the simulation can be viewed in either active or anaglyphic stereo to convey a sense of depth and immersion. 1...|$|R
40|$|Sub-optimal {{restraint}} use, {{particularly the}} incorrect use of restraints, {{is a significant}} and widespread problem among child vehicle occupants, and {{increases the risk of}} injury. Previous research has identified comfort as a potential factor influencing sub-optimal restraint use. Problems with comfort may lead the child to misuse the restraint in their attempt to achieve better comfort whilst parent-perceived discomfort has been reported as a driver for premature graduation and inappropriate restraint choice. This thesis consists of four related studies that have focused on the relationships between comfort and optimal child restraint use. These studies have examined the relationships between parent perceived comfort and both appropriate restraint choice and correct child restraint use as well as the relationship between child experienced comfort and correct restraint use. The results of these studies indicate that there is no link between parent perceived comfort and appropriate restraint choice. However, there is a relationship between parent perceived comfort and restraint misuse, particularly active misuse of the <b>harness</b> or seat <b>belt.</b> A method for measuring and quantifying comfort experienced by the child was identified and used to compare the level of comfort experienced by the child in an add-on restraint system and an integrated restraint system. These results suggest that while some parents report concern about their child’s comfort, parent-reported comfort levels were not associated with age appropriate restraint choice. However, parent reported comfort is important for the correct use of restraints. There is evidence to support the notion that the comfort experienced by the child is important for correct restraint use. The method we have developed for studying real comfort can be used in naturalistic studies involving child occupants to further understand this relationship. Overall the results of this body of work indicate comfort experienced by children in child restraints may be related to errors in use that occur through interaction between the child and the restraint system. It is recommended that naturalistic studies be conducted to confirm the relationships between child experienced comfort and restraint misuse as well as the relationship between specific restraint design features and comfort...|$|R
