5|$|Banned from competition, Chambers sought {{alternative}} commercial {{outlets for}} <b>his</b> <b>athletic</b> prowess. He had an unsuccessful American football try-out with the San Francisco 49ers, hoping to emulate Renaldo Nehemiah. He drifted {{on to the}} celebrity circuit, appearing on British reality television series Hell's Kitchen in May 2004. However, Chambers {{had little interest in}} the show and soon chose to leave. He appeared in neither sporting events nor television programs for 18 months.|$|E
5|$|His {{troubles}} {{adjusting to}} the new rules, and <b>his</b> <b>athletic</b> conditioning during June and July, prompted the team to sign Hank Gastraight for added pitching strength. He struck out just 61 batters in 283 for a 1.6 K/9, and his ERA increased from 3.03in 1892to 4.41. Despite this, he helped Boston claim their third consecutive NL championship with a 20–12W–L record.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, Robinson {{graduated}} from Washington Junior High School and enrolled at John Muir High School (Muir Tech). Recognizing <b>his</b> <b>athletic</b> talents, Robinson's older brothers Mack (himself an accomplished athlete and silver medalist at the 1936 Summer Olympics) and Frank inspired Jackie {{to pursue his}} interest in sports.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} <b>his</b> <b>athletic</b> record and {{remarkable}} career accomplishments, Ford acquired {{a reputation as}} a clumsy, likable, and simple-minded Everyman. An incident in 1975, when he tripped while exiting Air Force One in Austria, was famously and repeatedly parodied by Chevy Chase, cementing Ford's image as a klutz. Pieces of Ford's common Everyman image have also been attributed to Ford's inevitable comparison to Nixon, as well as his perceived Midwestern stodginess and self-deprecation.|$|E

5|$|Thorpe began <b>his</b> <b>athletic</b> {{career at}} Carlisle in 1907 {{when he walked}} past the track and beat all the school's high jumpers with an impromptu 5-ft 9-in jump still in street clothes. His {{earliest}} recorded track and field results come from 1907. He also competed in football, baseball, lacrosse and even ballroom dancing, winning the 1912 intercollegiate ballroom dancing championship.|$|E
5|$|After Muir, Robinson {{attended}} Pasadena Junior College (PJC), {{where he}} continued <b>his</b> <b>athletic</b> career {{by participating in}} basketball, football, baseball, and track. On the football team, he played quarterback and safety. He was a shortstop and leadoff hitter for the baseball team, and he broke school broad-jump records held by his brother Mack. As at Muir High School, most of Jackie's teammates were white. While playing football at PJC, Robinson suffered a fractured ankle, complications from which would eventually delay his deployment status while in the military. In 1938, {{he was elected to}} the All-Southland Junior College Team for baseball and selected as the region's Most Valuable Player.|$|E
5|$|After <b>his</b> <b>athletic</b> career, Thorpe {{struggled}} {{to provide for}} his family. He {{found it difficult to}} work a non-sports-related job and never held a job {{for an extended period of}} time. During the Great Depression in particular, he had various jobs, among others as an extra for several movies, usually playing an American Indian chief in Westerns. He also worked as a construction worker, a doorman (bouncer), a security guard and a ditch digger, and briefly joined the United States Merchant Marine in 1945. Thorpe was a chronic alcoholic during his later life.|$|E

5|$|Because White did {{not officially}} depart Minnesota {{until the middle}} of his second semester, he was academically ineligible to receive a {{scholarship}} from any Division I school in 2010. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) usually requires a two semester residency for transfers. He transferred to Iowa State prior to using any of <b>his</b> <b>athletic</b> eligibility at Minnesota and applied to the NCAA for a waiver to be eligible to play during the 2010–11 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, but the NCAA denied his waiver. Iowa State appealed the decision, but their appeal was denied.|$|E
5|$|Brown entered Massillon Washington High School in 1922. Although {{he played}} {{football}} as a child, Brown was undersized {{for the game}} at less than 150 pounds and at first focused <b>his</b> <b>athletic</b> energies on the pole vault. Harry Stuhldreher, {{who went on to}} be one of Notre Dame's legendary Four Horsemen, was then the high school quarterback. But Massillon coach Dave Stewart saw Brown's determination to be a good vaulter despite his small size and brought him onto the football team; as a junior in 1924, he took over as the starting quarterback. Massillon posted a win-loss record of 15–3 in Brown's junior and senior years as the starter.|$|E
5|$|Ernest {{decided that}} the train {{journeys}} and frozen limbs were too much for his son, so he sent Bill to St Patrick's College, Goulburn as a boarder in 1921, where he quickly showed <b>his</b> <b>athletic</b> flair by becoming {{a member of the}} school's rugby league, tennis, athletics and cricket teams. He held a state record for the triple jump. At the same time, he also represented the town team. During his time at St Patrick's, O'Reilly developed his ruthless and parsimonious attitude towards bowling. After three years at the Irish Catholic school, funded by a scholarship, O'Reilly completed his Leaving Certificate.|$|E

5|$|In 1934, Ford was {{selected}} for the Eastern Team on the Shriner's East West Shrine Game at San Francisco (a benefit for physically disabled children), played on January 1, 1935. As part of the 1935 Collegiate All-Star football team, Ford played against the Chicago Bears in the Chicago College All-Star Game at Soldier Field. In honor of <b>his</b> <b>athletic</b> accomplishments and his later political career, the University of Michigan retired Ford's No. 48 jersey in 1994. With {{the blessing of the}} Ford family, it was placed back into circulation in 2012 as part of the Michigan Football Legends program and issued to sophomore linebacker Desmond Morgan before a home game against Illinois on October 13.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Dodd {{stepped down}} as head {{football}} coach due to health concerns, and he was succeeded by assistant Bud Carson. Dodd simply retained <b>his</b> <b>athletic</b> director position, which he had acquired in 1950 from William Alexander. Dodd retired as athletic director in 1976 and was followed in the position by Doug Weaver. Dodd continued to serve during his retirement years as an Alumni Association consultant and as a fundraiser for Georgia Tech. In 1983, he expressed interest in running a United States Football League team if Atlanta were awarded one, but the league folded before Atlanta received a team.|$|E
5|$|Like his predecessor, Bill Dellinger's {{involvement}} with the University of Oregon began before his coaching career. He lettered in track at the university, graduating in 1956 and won a Bronze medal in the 1964 Summer Olympics. After <b>his</b> <b>athletic</b> career, he joined Bowerman's staff in 1967 {{as an assistant coach}} where he helped coach Steve Prefontaine. He took over as head coach in 1973 after Bowerman's retirement. With Dellinger at the helm, Oregon's Cross Country team brought home four NCAA national championships and the track and field team brought home one NCAA national championship. He retired in 1998. The Bill Dellinger Invitational is an annual race held at Hayward Field in honor of the coach.|$|E

5|$|On March 18, 2003, Owumi {{signed a}} letter of intent to play college {{football}} for Georgetown. He joined the team on a scholarship under head coach Bob Benson, uncertain of his future in basketball. Although Owumi had initially desired to play the quarterback position, his coaches wanted him to play wide receiver due to <b>his</b> <b>athletic</b> abilities. He later moved to being a safety and eventually became the Hoyas' third-string quarterback, {{but he would not}} officially play the position. Following the football season, Owumi often practiced with the school's basketball team but never joined. He decided to transfer out of Georgetown to focus on academics and basketball, retaining his four years of college basketball eligibility.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of an {{unofficial}} color line that excluded black players, Lillard did not play in the NFL after 1933. He remained active in football, playing for minor league and semi-professional teams, including the New York Brown Bombers, with whom he spent three seasons. Lillard was also a pitcher in Negro league baseball for five seasons from 1932 to 1944, and a guard in basketball for the future Harlem Globetrotters. After <b>his</b> <b>athletic</b> career, he became an appliance store employee and died in 1978.|$|E
5|$|An {{incident}} at PJC illustrated Robinson's impatience with authority figures he perceived as racist—a character trait that would resurface repeatedly in his life. On January 25, 1938, {{he was arrested}} after vocally disputing the detention of a black friend by police. Robinson received a two-year suspended sentence, but the incident—along with other rumored run-ins between Robinson and police—gave Robinson a reputation for combativeness {{in the face of}} racial antagonism. While at PJC, he was motivated by a preacher (the Rev. Karl Downs) to attend church on a regular basis, and Downs became a confidant for Robinson, a Christian. Toward the end of his PJC tenure, Frank Robinson (to whom Robinson felt closest among his three brothers) was killed in a motorcycle accident. The event motivated Jackie to pursue <b>his</b> <b>athletic</b> career at the nearby University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he could remain closer to Frank's family.|$|E
