5|$|At the time, World War II {{had broken}} out and by mid-1940, France, Belgium and the Netherlands had fallen to Nazi Germany. Australia had {{declared}} war on Germany and Miller wanted to join the military, but St Kilda told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was deployed outside Victoria, his career would be in jeopardy. As a result, Miller postponed his enlistment {{until the end of}} the season.|$|E
5|$|In 1788, Tarrare {{moved to}} Paris {{to work as}} a street performer. He appears to have been {{successful}} in general, but on one occasion the act went wrong and he suffered severe intestinal obstruction. Members of the crowd carried him to the Hôtel-Dieu hospital, where he was treated with powerful laxatives. He made a full recovery and offered to demonstrate his act by eating his surgeon's watch and chain; M.Giraud, the surgeon, was unimpressed by the offer and warned <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> did so, he would cut Tarrare open to recover the items.|$|E
5|$|In January 1900, Taft {{was called}} to Washington to meet with McKinley. Taft hoped a Supreme Court {{appointment}} was in the works, but instead McKinley wanted to place Taft on the commission to organize a civilian government in the Philippines. The appointment would require Taft's resignation from the bench; the president assured <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> fulfilled this task, McKinley would appoint him to the next vacancy on the high court. Taft accepted on condition he was made head of the commission, with responsibility for success or failure; McKinley agreed, and Taft sailed for the islands in April 1900.|$|E

5|$|Jiminy Cricket {{explains}} {{that he is going}} to tell a story of a wish coming true. His story begins in the workshop of a woodworker named Geppetto. Jiminy watches as Geppetto finishes work on a wooden marionette whom he names Pinocchio. Before falling asleep, Geppetto makes a wish on a star that Pinocchio be a real boy. During the night, a Blue Fairy visits the workshop and brings Pinocchio to life, although he still remains a puppet. She informs <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> proves himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, he will become a real boy, and assigns Jiminy to be his conscience.|$|E
5|$|On {{the episode}} of Raw {{following}} Over the Limit, Bret Hart was announced {{as the new}} Raw General Manager. During Batista's promo {{at the beginning of}} the show, Hart interrupted and told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> wanted a rematch against Cena, he would have to qualify for the Fatal 4-way match at the Fatal 4-Way pay-per-view in June. Batista refused to wrestle, citing his injuries, and as a result Hart awarded the match to his opponent Orton by forfeit. Following Hart's decision, Batista quit WWE. This storyline was put in place as Batista was legitimately leaving WWE to pursue acting and a career in mixed martial arts.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of God of War, Kratos had been serving the gods for ten years and had grown tired of his service and nightmares. When he confronted his patron Athena, she advised <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> killed the rampaging Ares, the gods would forgive his sins. With this selfish motive, he again agreed, and after finding and using Pandora's Box, he was successful. Despite being freed of Ares' influence, {{including}} the Blades of Chaos, Kratos was forgiven but was not relieved of his nightmares. A dissatisfied and despairing Kratos {{tried to commit suicide}} but was saved by Athena, who guided him to Olympus. Awarded the Blades of Athena, Kratos became the new God of War.|$|E

5|$|On March 9, Cross {{abruptly}} resigned as Attorney-General; Woods resigned the next day. Cross gave as his reason that Rutherford {{had told him}} that Cushing was re-entering cabinet, and Cross felt that that made his position untenable. Cushing gave a different account: {{he said that he had}} been asked by Rutherford to re-enter cabinet, and that the Premier had told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> did, Cross would resign. However, he denied ever having agreed to do so, and accused Cross of fabricating his story completely. Rutherford stayed silent until March 11, when he announced that he had refused Cross's resignation, and that he was still Attorney-General. Soon after, Boyle made his own set of accusations, saying that agents of the liquor license department, which was under Cross, had been demanding bribes from hoteliers in exchange for licenses and that Cross was aware of this. Cross denied the charge.|$|E
5|$|According {{to his own}} account, {{the idea}} for writing Dreamtime first came to Duerr {{when he was in}} New Mexico in the summer of 1963. He had spent the day visiting the Puye Cliff Dwellings and was {{returning}} to the Albuquerque Greyhound Bus Station, where he met a Tewa Native yerbatero (herbalist) buying a cup of coffee, and struck up a conversation. Duerr asked the yerbatero if he could help him find a Native family living in one of the pueblos north of Santa Fe with whom he could stay, to conduct anthropological research into the nightly dances {{that took place in the}} subterranean kivas. The Native told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> wanted to find out about the dances in the kivas, then he should go to the Pueblo of Our Lady of the Angels and study at the University of California. Duerr would later relate that this blow to his vanity first provided him with the idea of writing Dreamtime.|$|E
5|$|Bure {{was born}} in Moscow in 1971 to Vladimir and Tatiana Bure. At age 12, his parents separated, and he {{remained}} with his mother. Vladimir Bure, a Russian swimming legend, had dreams of Pavel becoming a professional swimmer, but he aspired to play hockey at an early age. He attended his first tryout with the CSKA Moscow hockey school {{at the age of}} six, despite his limited skating ability. Until that point, Bure had only played ball hockey on the streets. After Bure failed to impress in his first tryout, his father told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> did not show significant improvement within two months, he would withdraw him from the hockey school. By age 11, he was named the best forward in his league. Around that time, in July 1982, Bure was selected as one of three young Russian players to practice with Wayne Gretzky and Soviet national goaltender Vladislav Tretiak in a taped television special. By the time he was 14 years old, he was named to the Central Red Army's junior team.|$|E

5|$|McClellan {{was removed}} {{after failing to}} pursue General Robert E. Lee's retreat from Antietam, and Burnside was {{assigned}} to command the Army of the Potomac on November 7, 1862. He reluctantly obeyed this order, the third such in his brief career, {{in part because the}} courier told <b>him</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> refused it, the command would go instead to Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, whom Burnside disliked. President Abraham Lincoln pressured Burnside to take aggressive action and approved his plan on November 14 to capture the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia. This plan led to a humiliating and costly Union defeat at the Battle of Fredericksburg on December 13. His advance upon Fredericksburg was rapid, but the attack was delayed by his planning in marshaling pontoon bridges for crossing the Rappahannock River, as well as his own reluctance to deploy portions of his army across fording points. This allowed Gen. Lee to concentrate along Marye's Heights just west of town and easily repulse the Union attacks.|$|E
5|$|Momolo {{returned}} to Bologna in late September 1858 after his two brothers-in-law wrote to <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> stayed in Rome any longer the family might be ruined. He left Scazzocchio {{to represent the}} family's cause in Rome. Momolo shifted his priority to attempting to undermine Morisi's credibility, either by disproving aspects of her story or by showing her to be untrustworthy. He also resolved to confront Cesare Lepori, the grocer who Morisi said had both suggested the baptism and shown her how to perform it. Based on Morisi's story, Lepori had already been identified by many observers as being ultimately {{to blame for the}} affair. When Momolo visited his shop in early October, Lepori vehemently denied that he had ever spoken to Morisi about Edgardo or any baptism, and said that he was prepared to testify to this effect before any legal authority. He claimed that he did not himself know how to administer baptism, so had such a conversation occurred it could hardly have gone as Morisi described.|$|E
5|$|Nixon, {{somewhat}} dazed by {{the conversation}} with Dewey, dressed for the speech and reviewed his notes. Chotiner came into the senator's room, and told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was forced off the ticket, Chotiner would call a huge press conference and reveal all the maneuvering that had led to Nixon's departure; Chotiner added that the resulting furor would mean nothing to {{either of the two}} men, since they would be through with politics anyway. Nixon later stated that Chotiner's promise broke the tension and gave him a needed lift. Senator and Mrs. Nixon and his staff journeyed to the El Capitan, where they were met by a cheering group of Young Republicans on the sidewalk outside, including future White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman. In Cleveland, General and Mamie Eisenhower, with the general's aides, prepared to watch the speech on television in the manager's office above the Cleveland Public Auditorium, where the presidential candidate was to speak.|$|E

While this discussion is going on, Caldwell comes in & he feels entitled to the money, apparently Caldwell has been paid a percentage of all the drugs {{that goes into the}} club but he wants a bigger cut. Later, a shootout takes place with Simon and his associate being killed, Caldwell, wounded, forces Jason to walk back to the club at gunpoint. Being in the club, a video is played showing Caldwell killing Simon and his associate & is promptly arrested.|$|R

5|$|Afterward, Andy grows {{determined}} {{to escape from}} Shawshank, and informs Red {{that he is going}} to Zihuatanejo in Mexico, telling <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> should ever get out of prison, he should go to a hayfield in Buxton, Maine, and there will be a volcanic rock, and a gift for him under it. During an inspection the next day, Andy has disappeared without a trace. In a fury, Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at a suggestive poster of David Cassidy on the wall of Andy's cell, tearing a hole through Cassidy's rectum. Norton then pulls the poster off, discovering a tunnel that Andy had made his escape through the night before. Andy is then shown breaking into a sewage pipe while Norton is distracted by watching an episode of Friends, allowing him to crawl out to freedom. Sometime later, Red is brought before a parole board and complains that the concept of rehabilitation is just a way for the board members to make themselves feel important, and declares he will start killing people as soon as he is released; for no apparent reason, Red is put on parole anyway and released from Shawshank. Red goes to the field in Buxton with the volcanic rock to fulfill his promise to Andy, finding a box beneath the rock containing money and a postcard asking if he remembers the name of the Mexican village Andy told him about; unfortunately, to Red's annoyance, he does not. Andy is then shown preparing a boat on a beach in Zihuatanejo, eagerly waiting for Red to arrive, though Red never does.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Adam {{discovers that}} he can gain access to {{information}} about Earth's future. He has an information port installed in his brain and uses Rose's phone to call his answering machine at home and transfer data to it. The port also allows the Jagrafess into Adam's mind. The Jagrafess discovers {{the true nature of}} the Doctor and makes plans to kill him. The Doctor, aware of Cathica's presence outside the room, loudly comments on how altering the environmental systems will likely kill the Jagrafess. Cathica takes the hint and reverses the cooling system, causing Floor 500 to overheat and killing the Jagrafess and the Editor. As the humans on board the station and on Earth come to wake from the stupor they've been in, the Doctor congratulates Cathica and gives her hope for the future. The Doctor discovers Adam's duplicity and takes him to his home on Earth. The Doctor destroys the answering machine with the data from the future on it and tells Adam he is no longer welcome in the TARDIS. Adam tries to plead with the Doctor and Rose, saying that they can't just leave him to walk around with a port to his brain for the rest of his life, but the Doctor tells <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> just leads a quiet life, it probably won't be discovered. But as soon as the Doctor and Rose leave, Adam's mother returns home and, by pure accident and much to her shock, activates his brain port.|$|E
