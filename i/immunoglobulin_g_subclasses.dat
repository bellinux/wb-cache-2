40|$|SUMMARY. -Hyperimmune {{heterologous}} serum {{produced in}} sheep against mouse Ehrlich ascites tumour cells was absorbed with normal mouse tissue and fractionated by DEAE column chromatography into IgGl and IgG 2 fractions. In vitro cytotoxicity test showed that sheep anti-Ehrlich ascites tumour IgGl fraction was cytotoxic to 51 Cr labelled tumour cells whereas IgG 2 had no cytotoxic effect. Pretreatment of the tumour cells with the non-cytotoxic IgG 2 fraction slightly inhibited the cytotoxic action of IgGl in vitro. When EAT cells were coated with either IgGl or IgG 2 by preincubation in vitro before injecting intraperitoneally into mice, both fractions protected the animals against tumour growth. Injection of IgG 2 and IgGl fractions separately, one {{before and the}} other after the injection of EAT cells, resulted in partial protection only. The difference encountered between the in vitro and in vivo findings {{could be attributed to}} the host defence mechanisms involved in the in vivo test system.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the presence of}} hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in 58 patients with humoral immunodeficiencies. Forty-three of these patients had common variable immunodeficiency (CVI), 2 had sporadic hyperimmunoglobulin M (HIM) syndrome, 2 had <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>G</b> <b>subclass</b> deficiency, 4 had ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), and 7 had X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA). Patients with late-onset hypogammaglobulinemia (those with CVI, HIM, or <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>G</b> <b>subclass</b> deficiency) had a 38. 2 % prevalence of HCV infection. In patients with XLA or AT, HCV infection was not detectable. Most of the HCV-infected patients had persistent viremia, with histologic findings of chronic hepatitis. Although patients positive for HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) had received several lots of immunoglobulin, {{we were unable to}} detect any correlation between the time that alanine aminotransferase levels increased and the time that intravenous immunoglobulin therapy was given, except in one patient with CVI. Moreover, we found no differences in the number of blood transfusions, surgical procedures, or administrations of intravenous or intramuscular immunoglobulin between HCV RNA-positive and HCV RNA-negative groups. We concluded that: (1) the incidence of HCV infection in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia is much higher than that reported in the Italian general population; (2) although patients with hypogammaglobulinemia have persistent viremia, they do not show an aggressive course of HCV disease, nor does hepatocarcinoma develop; and (3) intravenous immunoglobulins are only one of several possible causes of HCV transmission in patients with humoral immunodeficiencies...|$|R

There was no significant sex difference for all the four IgG subclasses. Using Box-Cox transformation, we constructed smooth age-dependent percentile curves for the four IgG subclasses. For the 50 th percentile values, the plateaus for IgG 1 to IgG 4 are respectively 970 mg/dl at 13 years old, 481 mg/dl at 18, 48 mg/dl at 17 and 80 mg/dl at 13. Methodology, reagents, environmental and genetic factors might {{be responsible for the}} observed difference among the various reports. The IgG 2 level in our Chinese population seemed to be higher than that in Caucasians, which might account for the very low incidence of invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b disease among the Chinese.

40|$|The {{macrophage}} is {{a versatile}} cell that, {{in a normal}} environment, resides in an unstimulated state. Upon encountering inflammatory or immunologic stimuli (1 - 4), it alters its phenotype and becomes stimulated or activated ~ for secretory, microbicidal, or tumoricidal activities. The precise molecular steps leading to stimulation or activation are not known, although they may be initiated by the interaction of specific receptors on macrophages with ligands such as lymphokines or endotoxin, or by the direct interaction of macrophages with other cells. The response of macrophages to specific ligands {{can be compared to}} the cellular response to hormones. The interaction of a hormone with a specific cellular receptor may provoke a variety of responses by the cell (5). These may be early, occurring within seconds to minutes of exposure, or late, occurring after days of continuous exposure to hormones (6). Early responses are the direct result of hormone-receptor interaction, whereas late effects most likely require the generation of cytoplasmic messengers.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the internalization {{and growth of}} influenza A NWS virus in macrophagelike P 388 D 1 cells. Flow cytometric analysis using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled virus showed that the attachment of normal rabbit serum-exposed virus (NS-V) to neuraminidase (NA) -treated cells was noticeably limited compared with that to untreated cells. However, rabbit antiserum-exposed virus (AS-V) could attach equally well to both cells. Virus coated with Fab prepared from antiviral immunoglobulin G could not attach. These {{data suggest that the}} NWS virus can infect P 388 D 1 cells in one of two ways, via viral or via Fc receptors, depending on the presence of antibodies. The NS-V could grow in the untreated cells, but not in the NA-treated cells. The highest growth of AS-V in the NA-treated cells was observed at an antibody concentration showing 50 % plaque reduction titer. Growth was exponentially decreased toward the lower and higher dilutions of antibodies. By using three different <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>G</b> <b>subclasses</b> of monoclonal antibodies against hemagglutinin, it was demonstrated that both Fc receptors I and II could take part in this phenomenon. The presence of 20 mM NH 4 Cl inhibited the growth of both AS-V and NS-V, suggesting that the intracellular pathways after internalization via Fc or viral receptors are similar. These data indicate that the concentration of antibodies has a critical role on the antibody-mediated growth of influenza virus in macrophages...|$|E

The MAbs showing specificity for phase I cells (MAbI- 1, <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>G,</b> <b>subclass</b> 3 kappa) reacted {{with the hot}} phenol-water extract of phase I C. burnetii in immunodiffusion and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. MAbI- 1 reacted with high-molecular-weight components from phase I phenol-water extract and whole cell in an immunoblot assay. Specificity of MAbI- 1 for a carbohydrate epitope in the phenol-water extract was demonstrated by periodic acid inactivation of binding by a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Phase I antigenic sites were apparently well represented {{on the surface of}} cells as demonstrated by complete fluorescence and microagglutination.

40|$|It {{is known}} that the {{lipopolysaccharide}} (LPS) of gram-negative bacteria, {{in addition to being}} a potent adjuvant, is an effective carrier for covalently associated haptens. However, the toxic nature of most forms of LPS precludes their use as adjuvants or carriers for human vaccines. 4 '-Monophosphoryl lipid A (MLA), a derivative of LPS with attenuated toxicity, is currently being tested in humans as an immunological adjuvant. In this study, MLA was tested for its ability to function as a carrier for a small hapten, the trinitrophenyl group (TNP). MLA was first modified by addition of 6 -aminocaproic acid to the 6 ' position of the disaccharide backbone (Cap-MLA). TNP was then attached to Cap-MLA via the free amino group, yielding TNP-Cap-MLA. Immunization of normal mice with TNP-Cap-MLA resulted in high-titer anti-TNP responses of immunoglobulin M and all <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>G</b> <b>subclasses.</b> Furthermore MLA, like other T-cell-independent type 1 (TI- 1) carriers, induced responses in athymic and X-linked immunodeficient mice. In all cases, immunization with either MLA alone or TNP-Cap plus MLA failed to induce measurable anti-TNP antibodies of any isotype, indicating that covalent association of MLA and hapten was necessary for MLA's carrier activity to be manifested. These properties of MLA make it a potential candidate as a carrier for vaccine subunit components, such as small peptides, especially for situations in which T-cell help is impaired, as occurs following human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection...|$|E

We studied the impact of CD 25 + Tregs in a B cell lymphoma model in which Rag 2 –/– mice received adoptive transfer of wild-type spleen cells with or without CD 25 + cells, and concurrently subcutaneous inoculation of the B cell lymphoma cell line A 20. We also examined the effect of engaging the glucocorticoid-induced tumour necrosis factor receptor (GITR) − an approach reported previously to abrogate the suppressive effects of Tregs. Mice that received spleen cells depleted of CD 25 + Tregs showed significantly slower tumour growth and increased survival compared with mice that received unsorted spleen cells. The Treg-depleted group also had significantly more CD 8 + T cells infiltrating the tumours and higher levels of serum <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>G</b> <b>subclasses.</b> The anti-GITR treatment had no significant effect on tumour growth, survival or immunoglobulin production. In the CD 25 -depleted group four of 10 mice developed clinical signs of autoimmunity, in contrast to none in the non-depleted group. Forkhead box P 3 + T cells were found in tumour-draining lymph nodes in mice in the CD 25 -depleted group, suggesting an in vivo induction or expansion of rare transferred donor Tregs.

40|$|Monoclonal {{antibodies}} (MAb) to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and to {{the major}} outer membrane protein OmpA from Proteus mirabilis were generated and used to monitor the kinetics of uptake in macrophages of LPS as well as LPS bound to OmpA. Uptake was measured by a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in a microtiter culture system. The MAb were of various <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>G</b> <b>subclasses</b> and showed strong reactivities with their antigens. Four hybridoma clones recognizing LPS and three recognizing OmpA from P. mirabilis 19 were selected {{for the present study}} on the basis of reactions in ELISA and Western blot (immunoblot) analyses. In the uptake assay, it was possible to differentiate between antigen on the cell surface and antigen which had been internalized. Uptake of LPS by macrophages was relatively rapid during the first 4 h of culture and then progressed more slowly over the remaining 24 -h observation period. The level of detection of LPS in this assay system was in the nanogram range. When macrophages were pulsed with LPS for 30 min and subsequently washed to remove antigen not bound to the cells, the amount of LPS detectable on the macrophage surface decreased progressively for 3 h after the pulse, which indicated internalization of the antigen. Thereafter, LPS rose to an increased level on the cell surface. The rate of uptake of LPS was more rapid when it was in complex with OmpA. When the fate of OmpA was monitored in the same LPS-protein complexes by use of MAb to OmpA in a pulse experiment, the level of protein measured on the cell surface decreased after an initial rise, which again indicated internalization, but the protein did not reappear on the cell surface in a form detectable with the MAb. Compared with the LPS monitoring system, detection of OmpA associated with macrophages was weak, although the MAb to OmpA reacted strongly with the protein in the ELISA and Western blot analyses...|$|E

40|$|Using {{synthetic}} peptides, we {{have defined}} the major linear antibody epitopes of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), i. e., A 1 A (VP 1 (12 - 25)), A 1 Ba (VP 1 (146 - 160)), A 1 Cb (VP 1 (262 - 276)), A 2 A (VP 2 (2 - 16)), A 2 B (VP 2 (165 - 179)), and A 3 A (VP 3 (24 - 37)). A time course study with either pooled or individual sera indicates that susceptible SJL mice intracerebrally infected with TMEV strongly and selectively recognize the A 1 Cb epitope of VP 1, compared with resistant BALB/c or C 57 BL/ 6 mice, which broadly recognize {{most of the}} epitopes on the different capsid proteins. However, antibodies from SJL mice subcutaneously immunized with TMEV recognize primarily A 1 Ba, A 1 Cb, and A 2 A epitopes. A similar predominant recognition of the A 1 Cb epitope was found with antibodies from the cerebrospinal fluid of intracerebrally virus-infected SJL mice. Interestingly, a substantial level of antibodies against the A 1 Cb epitope in virus-infected SJL mice is of the <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>G</b> 2 a <b>subclass,</b> in contrast to an undetectable level of this <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>G</b> <b>subclass</b> in virus-immunized SJL mice. The level of in vitro viral neutralization by antibodies did not correlate with the clinical signs. Antibodies to A 1 Cb, A 2 A, and A 2 B were able to neutralize viral plaque formation in vitro, while antibodies to A 3 A, A 1 A, and A 1 Ba were not...|$|R
40|$|Comparisons of <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>G</b> (IgG) <b>subclass</b> {{responses}} to the major polymorphic region and to a conserved region of MSP- 1 in three cohorts of African villagers exposed to Plasmodium falciparum revealed that {{responses to}} Block 2 are predominantly IgG 3 whereas antibodies to MSP- 1 (19) are mainly IgG 1. The striking dominance of IgG 3 to Block 2 may explain the short duration of this response and also the requirement for continuous stimulation by malaria infection to maintain clinical immunity...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{majority}} of patients diagnosed with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura have autoantibodies directed towards the spacer domain of ADAMTS 13. Design and Methods In this study we explored the epitope specificity and immunoglobulin class and <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>G</b> <b>subclass</b> distribution of anti-ADAMTS 13 antibodies. The epitope specificity of anti-spacer domain antibodies was examined using plasma from 48 patients with acute acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura by means of immunoprecipitation of ADAMTS 13 variants containing single or multiple alanine substitutions. Using similar methods, we also determined the presence of anti-TSP 2 - 8 and CUB 1 - 2 domain antibodies in this cohort of patients. Results Antibody profiling revealed that anti-ADAMTS 13 <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>G</b> 1 and <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>G</b> 4 predominate in plasma of patients with acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Analysis of anti-spacer domain antibodies revealed that Arg 568 and Phe 592, in addition to residues Arg 660, Tyr 661, and Tyr 665, also contribute to an antigenic surface in the spacer domain. The {{majority of}} patients (90 %) lost reactivity towards the spacer domain following introduction of multiple alanine substitutions at Arg 568, Phe 592, Arg 660, Tyr 661 and Tyr 665. Anti-TSP 2 - 8 and anti-CUB 1 - 2 domain-directed antibodies were present in, respectively, 17 % and 35 % of the patients' samples analyzed. Conclusions <b>Immunoglobulin</b> <b>G</b> directed towards a single antigenic surface comprising residues Arg 568, Phe 592, Arg 660, Tyr 661 and Tyr 665 predominates in the plasma of patients with acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpur...|$|R
