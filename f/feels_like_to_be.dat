500|$|Books and {{characters}} in the series were inspired by books and films. For example, the character Slappy the Dummy {{was inspired by the}} literary classic The Adventures of Pinocchio. Some of Stine's ideas for the books also came from real life; Stine got the idea for the book The Haunted Mask after his son, Matt, had a Halloween mask that he had trouble getting off. Stine also uses his childhood fears to help him write his books. The author said, [...] "Luckily, I have a great memory. As I write a story, I can remember what it <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> afraid and panicky". Stine states that he often thinks of a title to a novel first, then lets the title lead him to a story.|$|E

[...] She said that the video [...] " [...] very much about [...] giving almost a physical experience of what it <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on a dance floor or fall in love, whether it's blood or endorphins or other body fluids." [...] She {{wanted to make a}} video about sex, but said that [...] "in a way that wasn't so clichéd. [...] And [...] is made to give you a picture of what sex really is, which I think is something that's very hard to do, because sex is everywhere all the time, but very rarely is it made out to be something real." [...] The video begins with a reversed scene of a young couple having sex. In cutscenes, Robyn appears with a tube dress with clear liquid flowing through it. When the young woman begins to switch her sex partners, the liquid in the tubes wrapped around Robyn begins to alter colors and flow more quickly. The video ends with Robyn standing alone with black liquid in the tubes.|$|E

500|$|The {{book was}} {{generally}} well received by critics, with several {{commenting on the}} honesty of the work. Charles Spencer of The Daily Telegraph wrote, [...] "Life offers much more than vicarious thrills. It captures the true spirit of rock and roll, the nitty-gritty {{of life on the}} road, and just what it <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a heroin addict who doesn't know where his next fix is coming from. It also movingly captures Richards' extraordinary love of music—an even more powerful addiction for him than smack—and perhaps more surprisingly, his manifest destiny as a human being." [...] Jim Fusilli of the Wall Street Journal said that [...] "Mr. Richards writes with disarming introspection about his childhood, family and fame. And it's quite likely that no rock musician has ever written so keenly about the joys of making music. With a warm sense of humor and willingness to share his grief, Mr. Richards in [...] "Life" [...] defies almost every public perception about him." [...] In The Independent, John Walsh commented, [...] "He tells it with complete, reckless, disclosure. Sometimes it sounds like a man ranting into a tape machine; sometimes, in the tidier and more reflective sections, you can detect the hand of his co-writer, James (White Mischief) Fox. But the watchwords of this book are honesty, confessionalism, telling it straight." ...|$|E

Hockey player Rick [...] "The Stick" [...] (Rock Anthony) ridicules Puck for being seen in the dress; they agree to a fight outside the school. Rick gains the upper hand and Puck is thrown into a dumpster, but he emerges brandishing a switchblade. Coach Beiste breaks up the fight; in the locker room, Puck tells her that the knife is a fake stage prop, and she retorts {{that he could have}} gotten expelled. Puck replies that he is flunking out anyway and a failure, telling her that she does not know what it <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> worthless. He breaks down, and Beiste comforts him as he cries. At home, Beiste tells Cooter that she is leaving him, and removes her wedding ring. He asks who else would love her; she answers: [...] "Me". Back at the school auditorium, she joins Puck in singing [...] "Mean", tells him that she has arranged for him to retake a crucial test to graduate, and promises to help him pass. As the episode ends, Rachel and Tina sing [...] "Flashdance... What a Feeling", and board the glee club's bus to Nationals.|$|E

And whenever I've been in any kind of depression, I've over the years tried to not only imagine {{what it feels like to}} not be there, but try to remind myself that I could just wake up the next day and it could be gone because that happens, and not to worry about it. And at the same time, when I'm feeling great, I remember the depression and think about the differences in what I'm feeling and why I would feel that way, and not be reactionary one way or the other. You just have to realize that these are patterns of life and you just go through them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Clements and Musker {{had agreed}} from {{very early on}} that the style they were aiming for was {{primarily}} that of Lady and the Tramp (1955), a film which they and John Lasseter feel represents [...] "the pinnacle of Disney's style". [...] "After that, everything started becoming more stylized, like Sleeping Beauty, 101 Dalmatians– which are fantastic films as well, but there's a particular style (to 'Lady and the Tramp') that's so classically Disney." [...] Lady and the Tramp also heavily informed {{the style of the}} New Orleans scenes, while Disney's Bambi (1942) served as the template for the bayou scenes. Bambi was described as a stylistic reference for the painted backgrounds, as according to art director Ian Gooding [...] "Bambi painted what it <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in the forest instead of the forest" [...] so The Princess and the Frog would in turn try capturing the essence of roaming through New Orleans.|$|E

[...] Piers Martin of NME said, [...] "Busy yourself with those nappies, Madge – {{this is what it}} really <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a girl.

[...] People Magazine ranked it among the year's best albums, stating, [...] "Take that, Britney! Move over, J.Lo! With a new generation of dance-pop divas following in her fancy footsteps, the baby Jackson shows who is still in control with this all-encompassing album that bounces from hip-hop to rock to classical—even during the same song—without missing a funky beat." [...] Dennis Kelly of The Morning Call added, [...] "If imitators such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, et al., are quiet the next few months, it's because the Queen of Pop has sent them back to class with new material to study." [...] Charles Taylor of Salon exclaimed Jackson [...] "has turned into a more interesting figure than Madonna, and a maker of better music." [...] The Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan announced Jackson to be the highest paid recording artist in history, signing a contract with Virgin Records in the mid of the 90's worth $90 million, and was declared to have surpassed the influence of Michael Jackson. MTV News also noted the album's first week sales nearly doubled those of Michael's Invincible, released later that year.|$|E
