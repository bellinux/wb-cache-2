50|$|A <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>Halma</b> {{has three}} {{distinct}} phases. The beginning (before opposing pieces come into contact) {{is usually a}} set-piece battle, with players setting up their favoured openings. The middle (when opposing pieces are blocking or jumping each other) is usually characterised by opportunistic play; the player with the most patience to check the whole board for opportunities, including those gained by moving backwards {{in order to move}} forwards, will gain an advantage. Players should also set up for the endgame (when opposing pieces have passed one another and must run for home), avoiding stragglers.|$|E

Parker & Co. in 1887, Chivalry won the raves of chess and checkers experts, but the game Parker called [...] "the best game in 2000 years" [...] did not catch on quickly with the general public.|$|R

Other articles were extended flights of fancy, such as [...] "The Unthinkable Carrier" [...] based on the idea of cutting Britain free of the Earth's crust so that it could float around the oceans and guarantee world peace, with the Isle of Wight kept in place by a tow chain. In a late 1950s piece, [...] "Sleep for Sale", he prefigured the concept of the capsule hotel ("Over to you, capitalists. But remember, I thought of it first."). Several of his pieces touched on the invented philosophical movement of Resistentialism, [...] a concept probably owes some of its force to the contempt that Jennings—a devout Catholic—felt for the intellectual fashion he was parodying.|$|R

40|$|The Massive Ordnance Penetrator(MOP) {{has been}} {{developed}} to destroy deeply buried nuclear components by controlled release from a B 2 or B 52 airplane. This type of release must be cockpit software controlled by the Tactical Optimal Strategy Game(TOSG) Protocol to optimally determine the war <b>game</b> aspects <b>of</b> the dueling from other countries' MOP releases, and the depth at which the MOP explosions can occur for maximal safety and risk concerns. The TOSG Protocol characteristics <b>of</b> <b>games</b> <b>of</b> strategy, <b>games</b> <b>of</b> optimal strategy and tactical games are defined initially by the <b>game</b> <b>of</b> strategy as a certain series of events, each of which must have {{a finite number of}} distinct results. The outcome <b>of</b> a <b>game</b> <b>of</b> strategy, in some cases, depends on chance. All other events depend on the free decision of the players. A game has a solution if there exist two strategies, which become optimal strategies when each mathematically attains the value <b>of</b> the <b>game.</b> The TOSG Protocol war game tactical problem for a class <b>of</b> <b>games</b> can be mathematically modeled as a combat between two airplanes, each carrying a MOP as the specification of the accuracy of the firing machinery and the total amount of ammunition that each plane carries.
