5|$|A {{group of}} {{powerful}} lords—including the Šubići, Kőszegis and Csáks—urged CharlesII of Naples {{to send his}} grandson, the 12-year-old Charles Robert, to Hungary {{in order to become}} king. The young Charles Robert disembarked in Split in August 1300. Most Croatian and Slavonian lords and all Dalmatian towns but Trogir recognized him as king before he marched to Zagreb. The Kőszegis and Matthew Csák, however, were shortly reconciled with Andrew, preventing Charles' success. Andrew's envoy to the Holy See noted that Pope Boniface VIII did not support Charles Robert's adventure, either. Andrew, who had been in poor <b>health</b> <b>for</b> a while, was planning to capture his opponent, but he died in Buda Castle on 14 January 1301. According to historians Attila Zsoldos and Gyula Kristó, the contemporaneous gossip suggesting that Andrew was poisoned cannot be proved.|$|E

The results indicated that the scale of self-efficacy <b>for</b> <b>health</b> behavior had acceptable reliability and validity. A second analysis explored the relationship between self-rated <b>health</b> and self-efficacy <b>for</b> <b>health</b> behavior. Structural equation modeling indicated that the self-efficacy <b>for</b> <b>health</b> behavior had a significant positive relationship with the self-rated health. These results suggest that the self-efficacy <b>for</b> <b>health</b> behavior is an important factor in enhancement of the self-rated health...|$|R
