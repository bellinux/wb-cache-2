5|$|In 1929 {{the company}} asked HM Treasury for an {{extension}} of the period in which government loans to the company could be paid. The Treasury first demanded an audit of the company accounts, and sent Sir William McClintock to write a report on the financial state of the company. McClintock's report revealed that the company had not earned any trading profits since 1925, but was still paying dividends by taking money from the reserves. The company had reported £439,000 profits for 1926, but had drawn £750,000 out of the reserves and falsified accounts to make <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> the money came from trading. In 1927 the company made a trading loss of £507,000, but money was again drawn from the reserves to make <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> the company had made a profit of £478,000. As a result of this, and a report that in 1928 the company had issued a fraudulent prospectus inviting customers to buy shares in the company and saying that it had earned an average £500,000 a year in the last decade, arrest warrants were issued for Lord Kylsant and John Moreland, the company auditor. At the time the ruse was discovered the company had a trading deficit of £300,000 a year, the reserves were completely exhausted, and the company owed £10 million.|$|E
5|$|On 17 December, {{orders for}} the {{complete}} evacuation of the peninsula were issued. The regiment started leaving the next day, when six officers and 155 other ranks left for Lemnos before dawn. Those left behind had to make <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> the trenches were fully occupied. At 21:30 {{two thirds of the}} remainder were evacuated. Other smaller parties left the trenches between 01:40 and 02:05, when the last officer and eleven other ranks moved down to the beach and were evacuated. The surviving 375 men of the regiment camped on Lemnos until transport was available to take them back to Egypt. Their involvement in the Gallipoli Campaign had cost the regiment a total of 640 casualties.|$|E

5|$|The Chronicles {{version of}} events makes <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> Baldred was driven out shortly after the battle, but this was {{probably}} not the case. A document from Kent survives which gives the date, March 826, as being {{in the third year}} of the reign of Beornwulf. This makes it likely that Beornwulf still had authority in Kent at this date, as Baldred's overlord; hence Baldred was apparently still in power. In Essex, Ecgberht expelled King Sigered, though the date is unknown. It may have been delayed until 829, since a later chronicler associates the expulsion with a campaign of Ecgberht's in that year against the Mercians.|$|E
5|$|Bamber and Mugford {{had started}} dating in 1983, {{when she was}} 19 and {{studying}} for a degree in education at Goldsmith's College in London. She had taken a holiday job in Sloppy Joe's, a pizzeria in Colchester, where Jeremy had a bar job in the evenings. Mugford admitted to a brief background of dishonesty. She had been cautioned in 1985 for using a friend's chequebook to obtain goods worth around £700, after it had been reported stolen; she said she and the friend had repaid {{the money to the}} bank. She also acknowledged having helped Bamber, in March or April 1985, steal just under £1,000 from the office of the Osea Road caravan site his family owned; she said he had staged a break-in to make <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> strangers were responsible.|$|E
5|$|Changes {{also took}} place among laymen, as aristocratic culture focused on great feasts held in halls {{rather than on}} {{literary}} pursuits. Clothing for the elites was richly embellished with jewels and gold. Lords and kings supported entourages of fighters who formed {{the backbone of the}} military forces. Family ties within the elites were important, as were the virtues of loyalty, courage, and honour. These ties led to the prevalence of the feud in aristocratic society, examples of which included those related by Gregory of Tours that took place in Merovingian Gaul. Most feuds seem to have ended quickly with the payment of some sort of compensation. Women took part in aristocratic society mainly in their roles as wives and mothers of men, with the role of mother of a ruler being especially prominent in Merovingian Gaul. In Anglo-Saxon society the lack of many child rulers meant a lesser role for women as queen mothers, but this was compensated for by the increased role played by abbesses of monasteries. Only in Italy does <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> women were always considered under the protection and control of a male relative.|$|E

5|$|The only internationally {{recognized}} authority for naming celestial bodies is the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The International Astronomical Union maintains the Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) which catalogs and standardizes proper names for stars. A number of private companies sell names of stars, which the British Library calls an unregulated commercial enterprise. The IAU has disassociated itself from this commercial practice, and these names are neither {{recognized by the}} IAU, professional astronomers, nor the amateur astronomy community. One such star-naming company is the International Star Registry, which, during the 1980s, was accused of deceptive practice for making <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> the assigned name was official. This now-discontinued ISR practice was informally labeled a scam and a fraud, and the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs issued a violation against ISR for engaging in a deceptive trade practice.|$|E
5|$|They {{argued that}} Bamber had then set about {{arranging}} {{the scene to}} make <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> Sheila was the killer. He discovered {{that she could not}} have reached the trigger with the silencer attached, so he removed it and returned it to the gun cupboard, then placed a Bible next to her body to introduce a religious theme. He removed the kitchen phone from its hook, left the house via a kitchen window, perhaps after showering, and banged the window from the outside so that the catch dropped back into position. He had then cycled on his mother's bicycle. Shortly after 3am, he had telephoned Mugford, then the police at 3:26am to say he had just received a frantic call from his father. To create a delay before the bodies were discovered, he had not called 999, had driven slowly to the farmhouse, and had told police that his sister was familiar with guns, so that they would be reluctant to enter.|$|E
5|$|At {{the railway}} station in Belgrade, Bond passes on word of Kerim Bey's death {{to one of}} his sons, and asks for an agent from Station Y to meet him at Zagreb. However, when the train arrives at the station, Grant {{intercepts}} Nash, sent from Station Y, killing the agent before posing as him. After drugging Romanova at dinner, Grant overpowers Bond before taunting him about SPECTRE's involvement in the theft. After disclosing that Romanova was unaware of what was truly going on, believing she was working for Russia, Grant reveals to Bond his plans to leave behind the film SPECTRE took of him and Romanova at the hotel, along with a forged blackmail letter, to make <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> their deaths were the result of a murder-suicide, to scandalise the British intelligence community. Bond quickly convinces him to accept a bribe of gold sovereigns in exchange for a final cigarette, tricking Grant into setting off the booby trap in his attaché case. This distracts Grant enough for Bond to attack him in brutal hand-to-hand combat. In the ensuing fight, Bond narrowly gains the upper hand, stabbing Grant with the case's concealed knife before strangling him with his own garrotte. Bond then drags the comatose Romanova from the train (which has been stopped by a SPECTRE accomplice), where he hijacks Grant's getaway truck and flees the scene with Romanova.|$|E

5|$|Cox falsified {{documents}} to make <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> he owned properties, and then fraudulently obtained several mortgages {{on them for}} five to six times their actual worth. He acquired millions of dollars this way; estimates report the amount at between US$5 and $25 million. Cox's first conviction occurred in 2002 when {{he was sentenced to}} probation for mortgage fraud. He was then fired from the mortgage broker position he held in a Tampa, Florida area firm. He began his life as a dedicated criminal in central Florida after that offense, before fleeing the area when his activities were discovered. His crime spree continued across the southern US, eventually landing him on the United States Secret Service's Most Wanted list. He was aided by several female accomplices, some of whom are in prison or have served time there for their participation in his fraudulent mortgage practices. Cox was arrested on November 16, 2006. Indicted on 42 counts, and facing prison sentences of up to 400 years, he plea bargained his sentence down to a maximum of 54 years on April 11, 2007 and was sentenced to 26 years on November 17, 2006. He is currently housed in a low-security prison in Florida. His story is well chronicled and has been featured on Dateline NBC, CNBC's American Greed, in Fortune magazine, Bloomberg Businessweek, Playboy magazine, and other media outlets.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes {{is shocked}} {{when the driver}} of the car gets out and is {{revealed}} as Doctor Browning, who has escaped from prison. He holds Mercedes hostage and forces her into the car, driving off and leaving Clare's corpse in the road. He takes her to the empty McQueen house and attempts to kill her, but Cindy and Lindsey arrive in time and knock him unconscious. Doctor Browning awakens and attempts to attack the women so Mercedes strikes Doctor Browning over the head with a shovel, killing him. The three women panic and put Doctor Browning's corpse into bin liners, stashing it in the attic of the McQueen home. When they discover that the attic is going to have new insulation a few weeks later, the three women scramble to dispose of the corpse and enlist the help of Freddie Roscoe (Charlie Clapham) to hide the body. Mercedes, Cindy and Lindsey place Doctor Browning's body in his car and push it off a cliff, making <b>it</b> <b>appear</b> <b>that</b> Doctor Browning had committed suicide after escaping prison. Cindy panics and alerts the police to the car crash scene. Police officer Sam Lomax (Lizzie Roper) discovers that Mercedes, Cindy and Lindsey were involved in Doctor Browning's murder and brings them in for questioning. When they all confess, she releases them, explaining that she has had to make some decisions to get rid of bad people, and the three women are set free, and Sam disposes of the evidence.|$|E

Watson and Pauly suggested this may be have been related to Chinese policies where state entities that monitored the economy were also tasked with increasing output. Also, until more recently, the promotion of Chinese officials was based on production increases from their own areas.|$|E
