25|$|Stonewall Jackson had {{acquired}} fame for his brilliant {{campaign in the}} Shenandoah Valley, but had performed poorly so far under Lee's command in the Seven Days. Perhaps too fatigued from his campaign and travel from the Valley, he arrived late at Mechanicsville (Beaver Dam Creek) and inexplicably ordered his men to bivouac for the night within clear <b>earshot</b> <b>of</b> the battle. He was late and disoriented at Gaines's Mill. He was late again at Savage's Station. The upcoming action in support of Lee's assault at Glendale would offer him another opportunity. Jackson and Lee met privately {{on the morning of}} June 30 at Savage's Station and Lee's exact orders were not recorded, but they apparently were for Jackson to march to White Oak Swamp and engage the Union forces there to prevent them from reinforcing the remainder of the rear guard at Glendale.|$|E
25|$|Historian Stanley Karnow said of Kỳ and Thi: “Both {{flamboyant}} {{characters who}} wore gaudy uniforms and sported sinister moustaches, {{the two young}} officers had been friends, and their rivalry seemed to typify the personal struggles for power that chronically afflicted South Vietnam. But their dispute mirrored more than individual ambition.” Both were known for the colorful red berets they wore. There were reports that Thi was showing insubordination towards Kỳ. The U.S. military commander in Vietnam, General William Westmoreland, said that Thi once refused to report to Kỳ in Saigon when requested. On one occasion, Kỳ came to I Corps to remonstrate with him in early March, Thi addressed his staff and asked mockingly, “Should we pay attention to this funny little man from Saigon or should we ignore him?” Thi made this comment rather loudly, within <b>earshot</b> <b>of</b> Kỳ, and the Vietnamese politician Bùi Diễm thought that the prime minister viewed Thi's comment as a direct challenge to his authority.|$|E
25|$|Ian puts Bobby in {{a private}} school, hoping that it will help with his anger problems. However, to pay for it, Ian decides to sell his {{restaurant}} to a supermarket chain, causing the locals to protest. Ian eventually decides not to sell, meaning Bobby must leave the school, {{even though he is}} happy there and doing well. Bobby overhears Jane talking about Bobby leaving the school and when she stops him going back to the school, he hits her over the head with his hockey stick three times, leaving her in a critical condition. He tells Ian in the pub that he has killed Jane, just like he killed Lucy, within <b>earshot</b> <b>of</b> everyone in the pub. After Bobby is questioned about the assault, he confesses to the police that he killed Lucy. They are reluctant to reopen the case but Ian is horrified when Bobby says he still has the murder weapon.|$|E

500|$|Dewar's own Court-martial {{began on}} 4 April. [...] The Court trying him was {{composed}} of five Rear-Admirals and eight Captains. [...] Dewar pleaded [...] "not guilty to two charges of accepting and forwarding a letter subversive of discipline and contrary to King's Regulations and Admiralty Instructions". [...] Dewar had the opportunity of cross-examining Rear-Admiral Collard over the incident of the dance and the disembarkation. [...] Collard admitted to saying certain things but refused {{to say that he}} had used improper words and not in <b>earshot</b> <b>of</b> anyone other than the Captain.|$|E
500|$|While the Paraguayans were {{familiar}} with the ground, maps of the territory were, for the Allies, non-existent. [...] The area lay in the province of Ñeembucú, which is flat, low-lying and obscured by swamp or carrizal. [...] For example, when they established their main camp at Tuyutí in southern Paraguay the Allies did not realise they were placing it within <b>earshot</b> <b>of</b> the southwestern line of the Quadrilateral: the Sauce trench. They did not even know Humaitá was protected by the Quadrilateral: In his 5-volume work on the Paraguayan war the Brazilian historian Tasso Fragoso insists that a Brazilian high command letter of April 1867 does not leave the slightest doubt that the allies were completely ignorant not only of the topography of the terrain , but that all of it was protected by lines of [...] entrenchments.|$|E
500|$|Several {{biographies of}} Hans-Joachim Marseille {{have written about}} his disdain for {{authority}} and for the National Socialist movement in general. Some biographers describe him as [...] "openly anti-Nazi." [...] When Marseille first met Hitler in 1942 he did not form a positive impression. After returning to Africa, Eduard Neumman recalled, [...] "After his first visit with Hitler, Marseille returned {{and said that he}} thought 'the Führer was a rather odd sort'." [...] On the visit, Marseille also said some unflattering things about Hitler and the Nazi Party. Several senior officers, which included Adolf Galland and Nicolaus von Below, overheard his remarks during one of the award ceremonies. Von Below asked Marseille if he would join the Nazi Party and within <b>earshot</b> <b>of</b> others, Marseille responded, [...] "that if he saw a party worth joining, he would consider it, but there would have to plenty of attractive women in it." [...] The remarks visibly upset Hitler who was left [...] "puzzled" [...] by his behaviour.|$|E

500|$|While Nielly and Montagu searched out at sea, Howe {{took his}} fleet {{on a series}} of cruises {{back and forth across the}} Bay of Biscay in the hope of {{catching}} the convoy. Between 5 and 18 May he found nothing and so returned to Brest, where his scouting frigates reported that the French battlefleet had gone. [...] Taking advantage of dense fog, Villaret had sailed the previous day, his ships passing within <b>earshot</b> <b>of</b> the British fleet. The French admiral was on the trail of Nielly's squadron; his intention was to meet both Nielly and the convoy and combine forces; with superior numbers he would then be able to escort the convoy to France in safety. Having eluded Howe and still some days from his planned rendezvous, Villaret gained an unexpected success when he ran across a Dutch convoy of 53 vessels. Its escorts, Alliance and Waakzaamheid, fled at the sight of the approaching French fleet, and Villaret was free to attack the convoy, capturing 20 merchantmen.|$|E
500|$|By dawn on January30, {{the road}} in front of the camp was clear of {{traveling}} Japanese troops. Mucci made plans to protect the POWs once they were freed from the camp. Two groups of guerrillas of the Luzon Guerrilla Armed Forces, one under Pajota and another under Capt. Eduardo Joson, would be sent in opposite directions to hold the main road near the camp. Pajota and 200guerrillas were to set up a roadblock next to the wooden bridge over the Cabu River. This setup, northeast of the prisoner camp, would be {{the first line of defense}} against the Japanese forces camped across the river, which would be within <b>earshot</b> <b>of</b> the assault on the camp. Joson and his 75guerrillas, along with a Ranger bazooka team, would set up a roadblock [...] southwest of the prisoner camp to stop any Japanese forces that would arrive from Cabanatuan. Both groups would each place 25 land mines in front of their positions, and oneguerrilla from each group was given a bazooka to destroy any armored vehicles. After the POWs and the remainder of the attacking force had reached the Pampanga River meeting point, Prince would fire a second flare to indicate to the ambush sites to pull back (gradually, if they faced opposition) and head to Plateros.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} hours of January 15, 1978—one week after his arrival in Tallahassee—Bundy entered FSU's Chi Omega {{sorority}} house through a rear door with a faulty locking mechanism. Beginning at about 2:45a.m. he bludgeoned Margaret Bowman, 21, with a piece of oak firewood as she slept, then garroted her with a nylon stocking. He then entered the bedroom of 20-year-old Lisa Levy and beat her unconscious, strangled her, tore one of her nipples, bit deeply into her left buttock, and sexually assaulted her with a hair mist bottle. In an adjoining bedroom he attacked Kathy Kleiner, breaking her jaw and deeply lacerating her shoulder; and Karen Chandler, who suffered a concussion, broken jaw, loss of teeth, and a crushed finger. Tallahassee detectives later determined that the four attacks took place in a total of less than 15 minutes, within <b>earshot</b> <b>of</b> more than 30 witnesses who heard nothing. After leaving the sorority house Bundy broke into a basement apartment eight blocks away and attacked FSU student Cheryl Thomas, dislocating her shoulder and fracturing her jaw and skull in five places. She was left with permanent deafness, and equilibrium damage that ended her dance career. On Thomas's bed police found a semen stain and a pantyhose [...] "mask" [...] containing two hairs [...] "similar to Bundy's in class and characteristic".|$|E

500|$|Art {{historian}} and curator Ugochukwu-Smooth Nzewi described Ogboh's work as capturing [...] "the maddening hyper-visuality of Lagos". Ogboh was among Nzewi's most anticipated artists at the 2014 contemporary African art festival [...] In 2013, Ogboh reported reception of his Lagos Soundscapes as mixed: annoying some and intriguing others. Quiet European cities {{have considered the}} work [...] "noisy and obtrusive", in one case destroying a speaker and calling the police on the installation. The artist appreciated the installation's effect on Nigerians abroad, and how being in <b>earshot</b> <b>of</b> the soundscape confused them in their foreign environment. Art historian Carol Magee noted how even {{in the business of}} the Lagos Soundscapes, she felt a stillness in which her attention was focused and the patterns unchanging despite the cacophony of the scene. Malawian visual artist Massa Lemu described Ogboh's work as embodying Afropolitanism, in which African cities were representative of a busy, globalized world and its multiple cultures centralized in one place. Lemu thought of Ogboh's soundscapes as [...] "auditory landscapes" [...] that recreate a sense of the Lagos environment. He additionally compared Ogboh's practice with that of sound artists James Webb (South Africa) and Magdi Mostafa (Egypt), though these two tend to manipulate their recordings where Ogboh instead recontextualizes the original. For this reason, Lemu considered Ogboh's work to be closer in lineage to John Cage's recontextualized found sounds than the practice of El Anatsui or Romuald Hazoume recycling found objects as commentary on economic conditions.|$|E

Time said Thi [...] "ran it [...] like a warlord of yore, obeying those edicts {{of the central government}} that suited him and blithely disregarding the rest". Of the four corps commanders, Thi was seen as the one with the most power and independence from Saigon. Kahin thought Kỳ may have feared that Thi would secede from Saigon and turn central Vietnam into an independent state. The CIA analyst Douglas Pike, who worked in Vietnam, speculated that this would have been a large part of Ky's thinking, as Vietnamese people have often had strong regional tendencies.|$|E

The heavy tum-tum of the basses throbbed obscurely against the rhythms of Spohr and Berlioz all the evening, like a toothache through a troubled dream; and occasionally, during a pianissimo, or in one of Lady Hallé's eloquent pauses, the cornet would burst into vulgar melody in a remote key, and set us all flinching, squirming, shuddering, and grimacing hideously.' ...|$|E

Ten pirates were killed and Skyrme had his leg taken off by a cannonball, but he refused to leave the deck.
