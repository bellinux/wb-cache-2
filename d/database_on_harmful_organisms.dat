Inventory 2, based on interceptions data and scientific and technical literature, of plant pests, plant diseases and weeds that can be associated with soil and growing medium (if relevant components thereof). Execution of Inventory 1 resulted in a list of 956 soils and growing media.

40|$|Abstract. In this research, {{the effect}} of {{modified}} bentonite <b>on</b> removing <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> in ballast water was discussed using HDTMA+ modified bentonite as flocculating material, and Alexandrium tamarense, Nitzchia closterium, and Photobacterium phosphoreum as the objects of <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms,</b> and also through an observation of the reaction mechanism between HDTMA+ and bentonite with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The result showed {{that there was an}} effective combination of HDTMA+ with bentonite, and the modified organic bentonite possessed a powerful ability to remove <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms.</b> The removal rate against Alexandrium tamarense within 24 h was greater than 85 % if the dosage of the organic bentonite was 0. 03 g/L; the removal rate against Nitzchia closterium was approximate to 80 % if the dosage was 0. 06 g/L; the luminous intensity could not be displayed by luminescent bacteria under the condition of concentration 0. 30 g/L, and also the original soil with modification did not shown a significant removal effect under the same dosage. Therefore, it was concluded that the conditions such as aging time, organic bentonite’s particle size, and HDTMA+ dosage were the important factors affecting the harmful biological removal efficiency...|$|R

40|$|As of January 1 st 2005, {{a system}} of reduced checks for {{phytosanitary}} inspections of certain plants and plant products imported into the European Union (EU) is in place. Under this system, plants and plant products satisfying special criteria may be inspected with a reduced frequency. These criteria are based on EU-wide data on historical volumes of import and interceptions of <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> in particular products. The objective {{of this paper is}} two-fold. Firstly, the paper analyses whether proportions of interceptions of <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> associated with cut flowers imported into the Netherlands ¿ the largest EU importer of cut flowers ¿ support the application of reduced checks for certain genera and trades (commodity-exporting country combinations) of cut flowers. Secondly, the paper analyses how effective the reduced checks system is in minimizing the expected costs of introduction of <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> in the EU. For that, a theoretically optimal system for allocating inspection effort to commodities is described. Using an illustrative example and stochastic simulations, the expected costs of introduction of <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> under the theoretically optimal system and the current system of reduced checks are compared. Examination of interceptions of <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> supports application of reduced checks for most genera and trades of cut flowers in the Netherlands. The results of stochastic simulations show that reduced checks may not minimize the expected costs of introduction of <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> into the EU.

40|$|The use of {{biocidal}} products is regulated in the European Union {{based on the}} {{biocidal products}} directive 98 / 8 /EC (BPD) and the biocidal products regulation (BPR). By definition biocidal products are "preparations intended to destroy, render harmless, prevent the action of, or otherwise exert a controlling effect <b>on</b> any <b>harmful</b> <b>organism</b> by chemical or biological means". This already includes a toxic action which should ideally be directed only against the target organisms (e. g. bacteria) and not against humans and the environment. Since the actual effect depends on specific use concentrations, several endpoints {{have to be addressed}} for final evaluation: * Testing of biocidal efficacy * DBL Risk assessment for humans (consumer and worker) and the environment. Whereas the requirements for toxicological studies used for risk assessment are well known and defined, this is not given for all efficacy studies. Here different study requirements are based on the specific application, which would include different matrices (e. g. cooling liquids), residence times and a varying spectrum of pathogenic microorganisms. (Table see in PDF-File) Especially in the area of disinfection (hygiene, hospital) the requirements for efficacy testing are well established and the benefit of biocidal use is evidenced. In the area of preservation the testing methods are not yet standardized. Many biocides are therefore not tested according to comparable conditions and the effective use concentration is difficult to derive. In consequence this might lead to ambiguous results and hence to a possibly overestimation in risk assessment. However, generally a risk-benefit analysis would be desirable for products, especially for those which display unique properties (essential use) in preventing infectious diseases in humans evoked by pathogenic microorganism and/or bacterial toxins. In summary for the evaluation of biocides the testing guidance's regarding microbial efficacy have to be further developed. Additionally guidance's on risk-benefit analysis would help to ensure a justified use of biocides...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>harmful</b> soil <b>organisms</b> in the root zone of Ammophila arenaria (marram grass) was examined by biotesting. For this investigation three locations along the sandy shoreline of The Netherlands were chosen: Voorne, Texel, and Schouwen. At all three locations <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> were detected in sand from stable dunes, {{as well as}} in sand from mobile dunes (degenerated and vigorous A. arenaria, respectively). In beach sand, however, no <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> occurred. Since A. arenaria shows vigorous growth only when it is buried regularly by windblown sand from the beach, it is concluded that this sand deposition enables the plants to escape from <b>harmful</b> soil <b>organisms.</b> Ammophila arenaria and Calammophila baltica (purple or hybrid marram grass) from the Voorne location were grown outdoors in containers filled with sand from the beach, the mobile dunes, and the stable dunes, and sterilized sand from the stable dunes. Biomass production of both species was highest in sterilized sand from the stable dune, followed by (in descending order) beach sand, sand from the mobile dune, and unsterilized sand from the stable dune. As compared with A. arenaria, however, growth of C. baltica was reduced less and without mortality of cuttings. Degree of growth reduction by <b>harmful</b> soil <b>organisms</b> could not be related to numbers of plant parasitic nematodes.

The Brassicaceae, which are cultivated worldwide, use glucosinolates and their decomposition products to defend themselves against attacks by <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms.</b> The glucosinolate content varies among individual plant species, plant organs and developmental stages. The glucosinolate content in plants is also affected by biotic and abiotic factors, while the type or quantity of glucosinolate determines the susceptibility of the plants to insect pests.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The device for killing <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> at surface and/or in edge layer of pourable plant products, includes gas and water supplyable chamber (1) with gas flow for isolating and swirling the products and movable source that emits ultraviolet-, electron- /microwave energy in the chamber. The gas flow (3) is directed {{in such a way that}} its effect is partially against the force of gravity. The ultraviolet energy exhibits a wavelength of less than or equal to 230 nm. The source is arranged within the chamber or is integrated in a chamber wall. The gas is a protective gas, an inert gas, air or a reaction product of undesirable chemical reactions such as carbon dioxide. The gas is sterilizable or germ reducible by a mechanism before entering into the chamber, and is heatable by another mechanism. The chamber comprises a reflector (7) formed as electron target for reflecting the energies. The plant products are processed in continuous- and batch processes by members. The chamber inner walls and surfaces areas of the plant products are subjected with the energies, during the isolation and swirling of the products. The flow properties of the gas are adjustable within the chamber. USE - Used for killing <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> at surface and/or in edge layer of pourable plant products. ADVANTAGE - The devices ensures complete killing of the <b>harmful</b> <b>organisms</b> at the surface of the plant products without destroying the vitamins or similar nutrients in the products, in less machine- and energetic expenditure...|$|R
