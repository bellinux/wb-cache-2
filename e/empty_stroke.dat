Based on {{analysis}} of press working characteristics, {{some of the}} main kinematics requirements for working mechanisms of servo mechanical presses were put forward: fast in <b>empty</b> <b>stroke,</b> slow and uniform in working stroke and big force gain. Crank link and knuckle-straight link are the most common working mechanisms in mechanical presses. To meet the requirement of servo mechanical presses, another mechanism, knuckle-triangle link, was designed. The kinematics simulations of the three mechanisms for a 1600 kN press were conducted by dynamic software ADAMS. Knuckle-triangle link had the most uniform and lowest slide’s average velocity and biggest force gain within the working stroke. For the same nominal pressure of 1600 kN, the required input torque of knuckle-triangle link was 9108 Nm. In comparison with crank link and knuckle-straight link, the crank’s input torque was reduced by 84 % and 76 % respectively without considering the influence of friction and inertia. In conclusion, knuckle-triangle link mechanism is more suitable for large-tonnage servo presses...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Left atrium (LA) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in left ventricular filling. It is well known that right ventricular apical pacing has unfavorable effects on ventricular systolic and diastolic performance. The aim of this study is to evaluate the LA mechanical functions with 2 D echocardiography in patients with a permanent pacemaker after short time ventricular pacing. Design: Echocardiographic examination was performed in 38 patients (mean age 63. 0 ± 10. 9, 18 female) with dual chamber pacemakers or defibrillators ( 90 % ventricular pacing at 70 beats per minute in DDD mode with an optimal AV interval. Left atrial volumes (LAV) including at the time of mitral valve opening (Vmax), at closure (Vmin), and at the onset of atrial systole (Volp) were measured. The passive emptying, conduit, active emptying and total <b>emptying</b> volume, <b>stroke</b> volumes were also calculated. Results: No significant differences were noted at baseline and after pacing for absolute Vmax, Volp, passive emptying, conduit, active emptying, total emptying volumes as well as the volumes indexed to body surface area (p> 0. 05). Conclusion: Short- time RV pacing seems to have no acute effects on left atrial mechanical functions. Key words: Pacemaker; echocardiography; left atrial volume; left atrial functio...|$|R

IBE is common in stroke patients and could necessitate indwelling or intermittent catheterization. The condition is correlated with urinary tract infections, which could impede rehabilitation progress and increase medical costs. Treatment for patients with IBE includes bladder retraining, biofeedback, medication, and botulinum toxin injection, {{but none of these}} interventions are completely effective. Methods: All patients with acute stroke who were admitted to the rehabilitation ward between August 2010 and April 2011 were included in the study and their PVR urine volume was checked. Electroacupuncture (EA; 1 Hz, 15 minutes) was performed on the acupoints Sanyinjiao (SP 6), Ciliao (BL 32), and Pangguangshu (BL 28) of stroke patients with IBE for a total of ten treatments (five times a week for 2 weeks). Bladder diaries, which included the spontaneous voiding and PVR urine volumes, were recorded during the course of treatment. Results: The presence of IBE was not related to sex, history of diabetes mellitus, stroke type (hemorrhagic or ischemic), or stroke location (P &gt; 0. 05). Among the 49 patients in the study, nine (18 %) had IBE, and seven of the stroke patients with IBE were treated with EA. Increased spontaneous voiding volume and decreased PVR urine volume were noted after ten sessions of EA. Conclusion: EA may have beneficial effects on stroke survivors with IBE, thereby making it a potential safe modality with which to improve urinary function.

40|$|Introduction: Neuroimaging of {{the self}} focused on {{high-level}} mechanisms such as language, memory or imagery {{of the self}}. Recent evidence suggests that low-level mechanisms of multisensory and sensorimotor integration may play {{a fundamental role in}} encoding self-location and the first-person perspective (Blanke and Metzinger, 2009). Neurological patients with out-of body experiences (OBE) suffer from abnormal self-location and the first-person perspective due to a damage in the temporo-parietal junction (Blanke et al., 2004). Although self-location and the first-person perspective can be studied experimentally (Lenggenhager et al., 2009), the neural underpinnings of self-location have yet to be investigated. To investigate the brain network involved in self-location and first-person perspective we used visuo-tactile multisensory conflict, magnetic resonance (MR) -compatible robotics, and fMRI in study 1, and lesion analysis in a sample of 9 patients with OBE due to focal brain damage in study 2. Methods: Twenty-two participants saw a video showing either a person's back or an <b>empty</b> room being <b>stroked</b> (visual stimuli) while the MR-compatible robotic device stroked their back (tactile stimulation). Direction and speed of the seen stroking could either correspond (synchronous) or not (asynchronous) to those of the seen stroking. Each run comprised the four conditions according to a 2 x 2 factorial design with Object (Body, No-Body) and Synchrony (Synchronous, Asynchronous) as main factors. Self-location was estimated using the mental ball dropping (MBD; Lenggenhager et al., 2009). After the fMRI session participants completed a 6 -item adapted from the original questionnaire created by Botvinick and Cohen (1998) and based on questions and data obtained by Lenggenhager et al. (2007, 2009). They were also asked to complete a questionnaire to disclose the perspective they adopted during the illusion. Response times (RTs) for the MBD and fMRI data were analyzed with a 3 -way mixed model ANOVA with the in-between factor Perspective (up, down) and the two with-in factors Object (body, no-body) and Stroking (synchronous, asynchronous). Quantitative lesion analysis was performed using MRIcron (Rorden et al., 2007). We compared the distributions of brain lesions confirmed by multimodality imaging (Knowlton, 2004) in patients with OBE with those showing complex visual hallucinations involving people or faces, but without any disturbance of self-location and first person perspective. Nine patients with OBE were investigated. The control group comprised 8 patients. Structural imaging data were available for normalization and co-registration in all the patients. Normalization of each patient's lesion into the common MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) reference space permitted simple, voxel-wise, algebraic comparisons to be made. Results: Even if in the scanner all participants were lying on their back and were facing upwards, analysis of perspective showed that half of the participants had the impression to be looking down at the virtual human body below them, despite any cues about their body position (Down-group). The other participants had the impression to be looking up at the virtual body above them (Up-group). Analysis of Q 3 ("How strong was the feeling that the body you saw was you?") indicated stronger self-identification with the virtual body during the synchronous stroking. RTs in the MBD task confirmed these subjective data (significant 3 -way interaction between perspective, object and stroking). fMRI results showed eight cortical regions where the BOLD signal was significantly different during {{at least one of the}} conditions resulting from the combination of Object and Stroking, relative to baseline: right and left temporo-parietal junction, right EBA, left middle occipito-temporal gyrus, left postcentral gyrus, right medial parietal lobe, bilateral medial occipital lobe (Fig 1). The activation patterns in right and left temporo-parietal junction and right EBA reflected changes in self-location and perspective as revealed by statistical analysis that was performed on the percentage of BOLD change with respect to the baseline. Statistical lesion overlap comparison (using nonparametric voxel based lesion symptom mapping) with respect to the control group revealed the right temporo-parietal junction, centered at the angular gyrus (Talairach coordinates x = 54, y =- 52, z = 26; p> 0. 05, FDR corrected). Conclusions: The present questionnaire and behavioural results show that - despite the noisy and constraining MR environment) our participants had predictable changes in self-location, self-identification, and first-person perspective when robotic tactile stroking was applied synchronously with the robotic visual stroking. fMRI data in healthy participants and lesion data in patients with abnormal self-location and first-person perspective jointly revealed that the temporo-parietal cortex especially in the right hemisphere encodes these conscious experiences. We argue that temporo-parietal activity reflects the experience of the conscious "I" as embodied and localized within bodily space...|$|R
