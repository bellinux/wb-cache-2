The devices are primarily intended to produce pure water, and the <b>dehumidifying</b> <b>effect</b> is viewed as secondary to their operation.|$|E

For this, fundamental experiments {{have been carried out}} focusing on the observation of <b>dehumidifying</b> <b>effect</b> of oyster shell and peltier elements used for air conditioning system. From this study, it is found that oyster shell has sufficient probability for using as a desiccant in air-conditioning system. Moreover, the heat releasing device(peltier element) can be used with direct current from PV cells so the system can be operated with high efficiency. As a result, the absolute humidity in a test chamber was reasonably controlled by oyster shell and peltier elements. Also the photo-voltaic energy from sun was enough for running power of this system...|$|E
