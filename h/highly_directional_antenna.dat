5000|$|The Rebecca/Eureka transponding radar was a {{short-range}} {{radio navigation}} system used for the dropping of airborne forces and their supplies. It consisted of two parts, the Rebecca airborne transceiver and antenna system, and the Eureka ground-based transponder. Rebecca calculated the range to the Eureka based on {{the timing of the}} return signals, and its relative position using a <b>highly</b> <b>directional</b> <b>antenna.</b> The 'Rebecca' name comes from the phrase [...] "Recognition of beacons".

Donor antennas can be of multiple types, but are typically categorized as either directional or omnidirectional. Omnidirectional antennas, which broadcast in all directions, are typically used for repeater systems that amplifier coverage for all cellular carriers. Directional antennas are used when a particular tower or carrier needs to be isolated for improvement.

5000|$|... ==Antenna system== The station's {{transmitter}} {{is located}} on Dix-Toledo Road just south of I-75 in Lincoln Park. The station has a <b>highly</b> <b>directional</b> <b>antenna</b> system. There had been 12 towers arranged in 4 parallel sets of 3 towers {{from the time of}} their upgrade to 50,000 watts in the early 1960s until the demolition or the easternmost three towers (The original mid 1950s Lincoln Park array featured four pairs of two towers). A view of this array is visible in aerial images and topographic maps of the era. This site is just west of Dix Highway, near its intersection with Emmons Boulevard. In the early 1990s, the easternmost set was taken down to make room for a Super Kmart store which opened in 1994. That store closed in 2003 during Kmart's second round of bankruptcy and reopened as a Meijer in 2004.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{each element}} in an AESA is a {{powerful}} radio receiver, active arrays have many roles besides traditional radar. One use is to dedicate several of the elements to reception of common radar signals, {{eliminating the need for}} a separate radar warning receiver. The same basic concept can be used to provide traditional radio support, and with some elements also broadcasting, form a very high bandwidth data link. The F-35 uses this mechanism to send sensor data between aircraft in order to provide a synthetic picture of higher resolution and range than any one radar could generate. In 2007, tests by Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin, and L-3 Communications enabled the AESA system of a Raptor to act like a WiFi access point, able to transmit data at 548 megabits per second and receive at gigabit speed; this is far faster than the Link 16 system used by US and allied aircraft, which transfers data at just over 1 Mbit/s. [...] To achieve these high data rates requires a <b>highly</b> <b>directional</b> <b>antenna</b> which AESA provides but which precludes reception by other units not within the antennas beamwidth, whereas like most Wi-Fi designs, Link-16 transmits its signal omni-directionally to ensure all units within range can receive the data.|$|E
50|$|The {{site was}} {{originally}} {{constructed by the}} British Marconi company. At that time it provided a new VHF colour television service, replacing the original monochrome service which launched in 1963. An access road was built from the Regent Road near Leicester village. The building also included its own power generating room {{since there was no}} public supply on the mountain at that time. A Francis & Lewis self-supporting triangular tower was used for the antenna systems. The site was inaugurated by President Siaka Stevens on the 22nd February 1978.The station was never directly attached by rebels during the countries civil war which started in the early 1990s. However {{as a result of the}} conflict, the condition of the site deteriorated. Because of a misunderstanding the Nigerian air-force attacked the site, believing it to be under rebel control. Damage was limited to one of the upper legs of the transmission tower which was hit by a shell.By the end of the war the VHF television service had been replaced with a lower power UHF transmitter. A low power FM transmitter was also installed for the radio service. However, the site was in very poor condition at this time. Meanwhile, Radio France International had installed a transmitter to cover Conakry with a <b>highly</b> <b>directional</b> <b>antenna</b> system. Even with Sierra Leones war, RFI found it easier to operate there than in Guinea.|$|E

Measurements of the angular dependence of the emitted THz radiation show that the metal tip acts as a <b>highly</b> <b>directional</b> <b>antenna</b> with radiation patterns well described by the theory for long-wire traveling-wave antennas.

The use of a scanning type system, i. e., rotating a <b>highly</b> <b>directional</b> <b>antenna</b> as opposed to more complex synthetic aperture type system is addressed. Targets for this system will be passive reflectors, not active transmitters like EPIRBs; reflectors which could be easily stowed, require little to no maintenance, could be quickly erected and can be more affordable than battery powered alternatives.

30|$|To {{resolve the}} {{multipath}} components in space, two measurement systems are generally used. One is to steer a <b>highly</b> <b>directional</b> <b>antenna</b> {{to scan the}} channel impulse response (CIR) from each angular direction. This gives the angle information of the channel directly. However, the disadvantage is that the antenna pattern is embedded into the results. The other method is to use an (virtual) array. The angle information of the multipath components can be obtained via beamforming or high-resolution algorithms [21]. A uniform circular array (UCA) is preferable to a uniform linear array (ULA), as the ULA cannot distinguish the paths symmetric {{with respect to the}} array line and the beam pattern of the ULA array is not uniform around the azimuth angle.|$|E

For these systems, we can assume a simple AWGN channel model. However, for systems having fading channels with multi-path, channel equalization and time of arrival (TOA) estimation needs to be performed prior to demodulation. The SER performance of the proposed signaling schemes in such systems depends on the performance of channel equalization and TOA estimation algorithms.|$|R

40|$|Millimeter Wave (mmWave) {{communication}} is considered as an enabling {{technology for the}} next generation of cellular networks because it offers much larger bandwidth and higher data rate than the current lower-frequency cellular systems to satisfy the exponential growth of mobile data demand. High gain <b>directional</b> <b>antennas</b> are needed to overcome high propagation losses in mmWave bands.

40|$|We {{develop a}} new {{framework}} for measuring and comparing the accuracy of any wireless interference models used in the analysis and design of wireless networks. Our approach {{is based on a}} new index that assesses the ability of the interference model to correctly predict harmful interference events, i. e., link outages. We use this new index to quantify the accuracy of various interference models used in the literature, under various scenarios such as Rayleigh fading wireless channels, directional antennas, and blockage (impenetrable obstacles) in the network. Our analysis reveals that in <b>highly</b> <b>directional</b> <b>antenna</b> settings with obstructions, even simple interference models (e. g., the classical protocol model) are accurate, while with omnidirectional antennas, more sophisticated and complex interference models (e. g., the classical physical model) are necessary.

30|$|One of the {{technology}} drivers of the fifth generation (5 G) mobile networks is the communication at the millimeter wave (mmW) frequency bands such as the Ka- and the E-band. The frequency spectrum between 26.5 and 29.5 GHz is proposed {{to be used for}} Winter Olympics in South Korea, of which 27.5 – 28.5 GHz is allocated for proof-of-concept 5 G demonstrations [1]. Some prototype designs operating at or close to the aforementioned frequency band have been recently presented in the literature [2 – 7]. All of them, with the exception of [7] are integrated circuit solutions that do not reach the output power levels required for long-range wireless backhaul. Future 5 G network base stations for mmW bands will operate at much shorter ranges than current LTE 4 G networks, mainly due to their higher operating frequency. A few hundred meters can be considered as long range for a mobile backhaul operating above 26 GHz. Such ranges require highly adaptive beamforming, <b>highly</b> <b>directional</b> <b>antenna</b> gain and mobility management.|$|E
40|$|While {{cellular}} {{communications in}} millimeter wave (mmW) bands have been attracting significant research interest, their potential harmful impacts {{on human health}} are not as significantly studied. Prior research on human exposure to radio frequency (RF) fields in a cellular communications system {{has been focused on}} uplink only due to the closer physical contact of a transmitter to a human body. However, this paper claims the necessity of thorough investigation on human exposure to downlink RF fields, as cellular systems deployed in mmW bands will entail (i) deployment of more transmitters due to smaller cell size and (ii) higher concentration of RF energy using a <b>highly</b> <b>directional</b> <b>antenna.</b> In this paper, we present human RF exposure levels in downlink of a Fifth Generation Wireless Systems (5 G). Our results show that 5 G downlink RF fields generate significantly higher power density (PD) and specific absorption rate (SAR) than a current cellular system. This paper also shows that SAR should also be taken into account for determining human RF exposure in the mmW downlink. Comment: Submitted to IEEE International Communications Conference (ICC...|$|E

50|$|An antenna transmits and {{receives}} radio waves {{with a particular}} polarization which can be reoriented by tilting the axis of the antenna in many (but not all) cases. The physical size of an antenna is often a practical issue, particularly at lower frequencies (longer wavelengths). <b>Highly</b> <b>directional</b> <b>antennas</b> need to be significantly larger than the wavelength. Resonant antennas usually use a linear conductor (or element), or pair of such elements, {{each of which is}} {{about a quarter of the}} wavelength in length (an odd multiple of quarter wavelengths will also be resonant). Antennas that are required to be small compared to the wavelength sacrifice efficiency and cannot be very directional. Fortunately at higher frequencies (UHF, microwaves) trading off performance to obtain a smaller physical size is usually not required.|$|R
40|$|With the {{increasing}} {{interest in the}} use of millimeter wave bands for 5 G cellular systems comes renewed interest in resource sharing. Properties of millimeter wave bands such as massive bandwidth, <b>highly</b> <b>directional</b> <b>antennas,</b> high penetration loss, and susceptibility to shadowing, suggest technical advantages to spectrum and infrastructure sharing in millimeter wave cellular networks. However, technical advantages do not necessarily translate to increased profit for service providers, or increased consumer surplus.

The results suggest that resource sharing is less often profitable for millimeter wave service providers compared to microwave cellular service providers, and does not necessarily increase consumer surplus.
