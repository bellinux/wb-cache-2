40|$|AbstractWith the {{continuous}} {{development of the}} <b>electricity</b> <b>market,</b> its character as a complexity system is increasingly revealed, which requires that we should integrate complexity theory into the evaluation of <b>electricity</b> <b>market</b> operation and should have the systems engineering way of thinking at the same time. This paper uses entropy to measure {{the complexity of the}} <b>electricity</b> <b>market,</b> then regards complexity as an indicator and integrates it into the index system of <b>electricity</b> <b>market,</b> after that a model which is modified based on entropy theory to evaluate the operation efficiency of the <b>electricity</b> <b>market</b> is established. Finally, the complexity and operational efficiency of the <b>electricity</b> <b>market</b> are evaluated by simulating data. Form consequence we can find that the complexity of the <b>electricity</b> <b>market</b> is higher than the general market, the efficiency of region 5 is relatively low, region 3 is the most efficient, other four regions are small in difference. The result shows that the entropy as a measure of the complexity of the <b>electricity</b> <b>market</b> is simple in calculation, it can also accurately reflect the complexity of the <b>electricity</b> <b>market.</b> The use of chaos optimization of entropy-random DEA model has good flexibility and feasibility for the evaluation of the operational efficiency of the <b>electricity</b> <b>market...</b>|$|R

25|$|A retail {{electricity}} market exists when end-use {{customers can}} choose their supplier from competing electricity retailers; one term {{used in the}} United States {{for this type of}} consumer choice is 'energy choice'. A separate issue for <b>electricity</b> <b>markets</b> is whether or not consumers face real-time pricing (prices based on the variable wholesale price) or a price that is set in some other way, such as average annual costs. In many markets, consumers do not pay based on the real-time price, and hence have no incentive to reduce demand at times of high (wholesale) prices or to shift their demand to other periods. Demand response may use pricing mechanisms or technical solutions to reduce peak demand.|$|E

500|$|One {{criticism}} to the UCS {{study is}} that the analysis was made using average emissions rates across regions instead of marginal generation {{at different times of}} the day. The former approach {{does not take into account}} the generation mix within interconnected <b>electricity</b> <b>markets</b> and shifting load profiles throughout the day. An analysis by three economist affiliated with the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), published in November 2014, developed a methodology to estimate marginal emissions of electricity demand that vary by location and time of day across the United States. The marginal analysis, applied to plug-in electric vehicles, found that the emissions of charging PEVs vary by region and hours of the day. In some regions, such as the Western U.S. and Texas, [...] emissions per mile from driving PEVs are less than those from driving a hybrid car. However, in other regions, such as the Upper Midwest, charging during the recommended hours of midnight to 4 a.m. implies that PEVs generate more emissions per mile than the average car currently on the road. The results show a fundamental tension between electricity load management and environmental goals as the hours when electricity is the least expensive to produce tend to be the hours with the greatest emissions. This occurs because coal-fired units, which have higher emission rates, are most commonly used to meet base-level and off-peak electricity demand; while natural gas units, which have relatively low emissions rates, are often brought online to meet peak demand.|$|E

An analysis by three economist affiliated with the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), published in November 2014, developed a methodology to estimate marginal emissions of electricity demand that vary by location and time of day across the United States. The study used emissions and consumption data for 2007 through 2009, and used the specifications for the Chevrolet Volt (all-electric range of [...] ). The analysis found that marginal emission rates are more than three times as large in the Upper Midwest compared to the Western U.S., and within regions, rates for some hours of the day are more than twice those for others. Applying the results of the marginal analysis to plug-in electric vehicles, the NBER researchers found that the emissions of charging PEVs vary by region and hours of the day. In some regions, such as the Western U.S. and Texas, [...] emissions per mile from driving PEVs are less than those from driving a hybrid car.
