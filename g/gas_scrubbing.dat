30|$|The {{variations}} in magmatic gas flux {{to the lake}} appear to drive the systematic short-term {{variations in}} CO 2 /SO 2 observed at Poás (de Moor et al. 2016 b). Essentially, sulfur chemistry drives these variations. At low temperature and higher pH (low <b>gas</b> flux), sulfur <b>scrubbing</b> reactions result in molar CO 2 /SO 2 ratios typically greater than ~[*] 0.7. At high temperature and low pH (high <b>gas</b> flux), the <b>scrubbing</b> reactions in the lake are less efficient, resulting in lower CO 2 /SO 2 below 0.4; these values are similar to ratios observed in the high-temperature magmatic gases at the Poás dome fumaroles. Thus, when gas input to the lake decreases, the CO 2 /SO 2 ratio increases and phreatic eruptions occur (de Moor et al. 2016 b). Long-term variations at Poás follow similar principles, but CO 2 /SO 2 varies to much larger degrees over several orders of magnitude.|$|R

40|$|Municipal {{solid waste}} {{incineration}} plants equipped with wet flue <b>gas</b> <b>scrubbing</b> generate process solutions like acid flue <b>gas</b> <b>scrubbing</b> water containing heavy metals such as Hg(II), Cd(II), Zn(II), Cu(II), Pb(II), Ni(II), and Fe(II/III). The specification of these heavy metals does usualy prevent a utilization. Hence a special solvent extraction process has been developed for the removal and the recovery of Hg(II) from acid flue <b>gas</b> <b>scrubbing</b> solutions. The process is based upon extraction of chloromercurat complexes {{by means of the}} anionexchanger Aliquat 336 solved in a mixture of n-paraffins and 1 -decanole. After multiple washing stages the mercury is stripped using an aqueous ethylenediamine solution. The process was tested on a semi-technical scale for feed solutions containing hydrochloric acid in a concentration range of 0. 5 - 5 mole/l. Model solutions as well as flue <b>gas</b> <b>scrubbing</b> solutions from the TAMARA test incinerator for municipal solid waste have been used. The mercury can easily be recovered out of the stripping phase by electrolysis. The described solvent extraction process can also be applied to the recovery of cadmium and zinc. (orig.)

B. das saure Rauchgaswaschwasser, die Schwermetalle enthalten wie Hg(II), Cd(II), Zn(II), Cu(II), Pb(II), Ni(II) und Fe(II/III). Aus der ueblichen Abwasserbehandlung erhaelt man die Schwermetalle nur als nicht verwertbaren Rueckstand. Deswegen wurde speziell fuer die Abtrennung und die Gewinnung von Quecksilber aus dem sauren Rauchgaswaschwasser ein Fluessig-Fluessig-Extraktionsverfahren entwickelt. Der Prozess zur Hg(II) -Abtrennung basiert auf der Extraktion mit dem Anionenaustauscher Aliquat 336, geloest in einem Gemisch aus n-Paraffinen und 1 -Decanol. Nach einer mehrstufigen Waesche erfolgt die Rueckextraktion mit waessriger Ethylendiaminloesung. Das Verfahren wurde im halbtechnischen Massstab fuer HCl-Konzentrationen der Speiseloesung zwischen 0, 5 und 5 M sowohl mit Modelloesungen als auch mit realem Rauchgaswaschwasser der Versuchsanlage TAMARA getestet.

CO 2 in the form of flue gas yielded less growth with increasing percentage; however, the lipid production revealed a steady elevation on sparging a higher percentage of flue gas. To investigate the toxic effects of flue gas entities, factors related to the stress-stabilization mechanisms were studied. Activity staining of stress stabilizing enzymes- superoxide dismutase and esterase showed increased activity.

The method of treatment is by using adsorption process with two types of adsorbent which are treated rice husk, and activated carbon.

From the results we can see the oil residue and COD decreased while MEA concentration wastewater remains the same. Activated carbon became the most effective adsorbent for the adsorption process with up to 43. 57 % oil content removal and 66. 81 % COD reduction.
