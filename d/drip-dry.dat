His {{grandparents}} fled anti-Jewish pogroms in eastern Europe, and his father went on to run a successful business making <b>drip-dry</b> shirts. The business was sold when Green was 13.|$|E
50|$|Between August 26 and 28, {{the first}} 138 Immaculata Academy {{students}} registered for 10th through 12th grades at Mercy Hospital. On August 31, Rev. Thomas Anglim - Immaculata Academy president - conducted the first faculty meeting. Four lay teachers completed the faculty: Mrs. Hortensia San Juan, Mrs. Frank Boscia, Mrs. Frank Kirby, and Mrs. Wilma Pool Knight, {{who had been}} at Bishop Kenny High School in Jacksonville, Florida. Mrs. Knight continued to teach Biology and Physical Education at the school for 17 years. Mrs. Knight had also taught Home Economics and Physical Education at Sts. Peter and Paul School in Miami. The school uniform chosen by the faculty was a skirt and blouse of a beige <b>drip-dry</b> material, saddle oxfords, along with a dark brown cardigan for winter months.|$|E
5000|$|Grace Coddington, Sassoon's former {{model and}} {{creative}} director of American Vogue, said that he changed the way the public looked at hair: [...] Before Sassoon, it was all back-combing and lacquer; {{the whole thing was}} to make it high and artificial. Suddenly you could put your fingers through your hair! He didn’t create five-point cut for me; he created it on me. It was an extraordinary cut; no one has bettered it since. And it liberated everyone. You could just sort of <b>drip-dry</b> it and shake it. [...] John Barrett of the John Barrett Salon at Bergdorf Goodman said that Sassoon [...] "was the creator of sensual hair. This was somebody who changed our industry entirely, not just {{from the point of view}} of cutting hair but actually turning it into a business. He was one of the first who had a product line bought out by a major corporation".|$|E
50|$|Using a rastrello, {{a special}} spoon-shaped knife, the fresh peel is de-pulped. It is then {{thoroughly}} washed with limewater and <b>drip-dried</b> on woven mats or special baskets for 3 to 24 hours, {{depending on the}} ripeness of the fruit, the temperature, and the humidity. These steps harden the peel, causing the oil to spurt from the oil glands more easily, and the lime helps neutralize the acidity of the peel.|$|R
40|$|Washing of VHCs in {{detergent}} {{followed by}} <b>drip-drying</b> {{is an effective}} means to mitigate electrostatic charge associated with non-conducting devices. Recently, manufacturers have developed VHCs manufactured from charge-dissipative materials {{as a means of}} avoiding this preparation step to improve compliance. We report the outcome from measurements of total emitted mass (TEM) and fine particle mass (FPM< 4. 7 µm) from non-conducting and anti-static versions of the AeroChamber Plus*/mouthpiece VHC family with nine widely prescribed HFA pressurized metered dose inhaler-based formulations. Values of either TEM or FPM< 4. 7 µm for the two VHC variants were within 10 % of each other for every formulation evaluated, demonstrating substantial in vitro equivalence, provided that the manufacturer’s instructions for device preparation are followed...|$|R
2500|$|The Brothers in Rhythm remix of [...] "Too Far" [...] {{received}} favourable {{reviews from}} most music critics. Charlie Porter from Amazon.co.uk was positive towards the remix, stating [...] "Brothers In Rhythm work their slinky magic on [...] "Too Far"...". Porter highlighted the song as an album stand out track. Brendan Swift from AllMusic was mixed {{in his review}} from Impossible Remixes, which the Brothers in Rhythm remix of [...] "Too Far" [...] was included on. He commented that [...] "with ten versions of four songs ("Too Far", [...] "Some Kind of Bliss", [...] "Did it Again", and [...] "Breathe"), there's {{not a lot of}} room for variation... and the repetition certainly makes for classic club fodder." [...] However, Swift acknowledge that Brothers in Rhythm, and other remix artists from the two accompanying albums, [...] "do their best to mix it up, and they succeed by <b>drip-drying</b> the pop melodies and distilling them into pure club-style mash." [...] Despite an airplay and vinyl release, the Brothers in Rhythm remix failed to appear on any record charts. No music video was directed or produced.|$|R
5000|$|Alternative Press {{stated that}} The Hour of Bewilderbeast gives [...] "as full a {{portrait}} as possible of Gough's musical and personal life," [...] while David Browne, writing in Entertainment Weekly, called the album an [...] "intimate hour that's far from bewildering." [...] Pat Blashill of Rolling Stone compared Gough to Elliott Smith and Nick Drake and wrote that [...] "like Drake, he's {{mastered the art}} of evoking melancholy without slathering on too much sentimentality." [...] Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times drew similar comparisons to Drake, while noting that Gough [...] "never succumbs to Drake's sad solipsism, though, favoring an expansive reach emotionally and musically." [...] In a more mixed assessment, Spins Barney Hoskyns wrote that [...] "Gough's dewy little tunes are mere scribblings in the margins of alt-folk's dog-eared hook-book, while his too-cool-to-care singing is <b>drip-dry</b> dreary" [...] and that The Hour of Bewilderbeast, when compared to Elliott Smith's Figure 8, makes Gough [...] "look like an imposter." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{novel is}} set in Melbourne. The first-person narrator, Eddie Harnovey, is a Chemical Engineer, married to Tanya, an {{aspiring}} but ultimately uncontracted Political Science academic. Eddie is from middle class origins, his father being a clerk for a local council. His childhood friend Amanda, however, was a class above them. As a Chemical Engineer, her father wore starched cotton shirts while Eddie's father wore <b>drip-dry</b> poly-cotton shirts. Amanda's family banned Eddie from meeting her. Nevertheless, Eddie meets Amanda every nine and half years. The next time is as undergraduates, where Eddie notices her in a queue for more fashionable food than {{he is in the}} queue for. The next time is as fellow shoppers in a department store, as Eddie looks for formal wear for his marriage to Tanya. The next time he meets her is in much straitened circumstances. Downsized, jobless, and with only three dollars in his bank account, Eddie skips an appointment with Amanda - now an employment consultant - and ends up beaten unconscious protecting a friend of a now indigent man Eddie befriended while still solvent. Eddie's report on Amanda's father's smelter expansion was the reason Eddie was downsized. Amanda identifies Eddie from the appointment card he had in his shirt pocket.|$|E
5000|$|Christian Dior's 'New Look' {{collection}} in 1947 brought a revolution to the fashionable silhouette of the Fifties. Dior's nostalgic femininity of round shoulders, full skirts, padded hips and tiny waists replaced the boxy {{style of the}} wartime period at WWII. The trend of hourglass silhouette brought by the popularity of Dior guaranteed the market for intimate apparel. Although intimate apparels are usually hidden by outerwear, intimate apparel is especially emblematic for the contradictory beauty in the 1950s as the silhouette was created depends {{on the type of}} foundation garments worn. Foundation garments became essential items to maintain the curvy silhouette, especially waspies, girdles and horsehair padding. For example, the sales of corsets doubled in the decade 1948-58 (Haye, 1996 p.187). Dior's 'New Look' collection brought back the boned intimate apparels for women, even the young one, in order to create the feminised silhouettes that embrace feminity. Symington Corset Company of Market Harborough was one of the famous intimate apparel producers in the 1950s as they are the official producer of Dior's corselettes and girdles. [...] "All the girdles were produced to the same design, in either black or white. The sugar-pink cotton velvet trimming was a particular feature of the range, and some were woven with Christian Dior's initials in the elastic panels on the side..." [...] (Lynn, 2010, p.106). A brand new 'Bri-Nylon' fabric was introduced by the British Nylon Spinners. This fabric was popular fabric to be applied on intimate apparel in the 1950s because {{it was one of the}} first easy-to-launder and <b>drip-dry</b> fabric. There was a full corset advertisement in 1959 shows the popularity of 'Bri-Nylon' and the design of the corselet in the 1950s. 'This exquisite Dior corselet features jacquard elastic net with the down-stretch back panel of stain elastic. The enchanting front panel is in Bri-Nylon lace and marquisette highlighted with criss-cross bands of narrow velvet ribbon. It has side fastening - partly hook and eye with zipping extension. The very light boning is covered with velveteen.' (Warren, 2001, p.30 [...] ) From the above advertisement, it is not hard to find that the corselets in the 1950s were constructed in details with boning, panels, different fabrics in different elasticity.|$|E

40|$|<b>Drip-dry</b> shirts: the {{evolution}} of the graphic designer’ is the publication which documents and assesses the work of the practitioners who created the now familiar term ‘graphic design’. Through illustrated interviews and contextual essays this book is an insight into what being a designer was like during this formative period and reveals the expectations, aspirations and influences of the time. Information and historical details together with the anecdotes and observations bring to life the famous works and lives of the contributors and present a fresh and personal approach to design history. Wright’s contribution to this book took the form of additional writing, researching and editing. She was commissioned to research and write the contributors biographies. These included the extended biographies of the key protagonists Wim Crouwel, Milton Glaser, Ken Garland, Rosemarie Tissi, Colin Forbes, Geoff White, Karl Gerstner, Margaret Clavert and Ivan Chermayeff {{as well as those of}} the secondary interviewees Experimental Jetset, Brookie Maxwell, Peter Smith, Sabina Oberholzer, Michael Gericke, Rupert Bassett, Helmut Schmidt Rhen, Kerr Noble and Dirk Futterer. With Ray Roberts and Kelvyn Laurence Smith Wright also contributed to the introductory dimension essays. This involved the research, development and sourcing of visual references for The Type, The Trademark and The Imagery in particular. In collaboration with Kelvyn Laurence Smith she selected, researched, compiled and edited Smith’s timeline for the reference section of the book. Wright’s contributions are credited in the end pages marked with coloured tabs for the purpose of this exercise. ‘Drip Dry Shirts’ was recently included in 50 reading lists published by Spin where Margaret Calvert and Karl Gerstner selected it among the top ten books they believed designers should read (www. spin. co. uk) ...|$|E
