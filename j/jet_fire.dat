MethodsIn particular, a <b>jet</b> <b>fire</b> incident in a chemical plant operated under high pressure may bring severe damage. To review this event numerically, Computational Fluid Dynamics methodology was used to simulate a <b>jet</b> <b>fire</b> at a pipe of a compressor under high pressure.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} a combined experimental, analytical and numerical modelling investigation into hydrogen jet fires in a passively ventilated enclosure. The work {{was funded by}} the EU Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking project Hyindoor. It is relevant to situations where hydrogen is stored or used indoors. In such situations passive ventilation can be used to prevent the formation of a flammable atmosphere following a release of hydrogen. Whilst a significant amount of work has been reported on unignited releases in passively ventilated enclosures and on outdoor hydrogen jet fires, very {{little is known about the}} behaviour of hydrogen jet fires in passively ventilated enclosures. This paper considers the effects of passive ventilation openings on the behaviour of hydrogen jet fires. A series of hydrogen <b>jet</b> <b>fire</b> experiments were carried out using a 31  m 3 passively ventilated enclosure. The test programme included subsonic and chocked flow releases with varying hydrogen release rates and vent configurations. In most of the tests the hydrogen release rate was sufficiently low and the vent area sufficiently large to lead to a well-ventilated <b>jet</b> <b>fire.</b> In a limited number of tests the vent area was reduced, allowing under-ventilated conditions to be investigated. The behaviour of a <b>jet</b> <b>fire</b> in a passively ventilated enclosure depends on the hydrogen release rate, the vent area and the thermal properties of the enclosure. An analytical model was used to quantify the relative importance of the hydrogen release rate and vent area, whilst the influence of the thermal properties of the enclosure were investigated using a CFD model. Overall, the results indicate that passive ventilation openings that are sufficiently large to safely ventilate an unignited release will tend to be large enough to prevent a <b>jet</b> <b>fire</b> from becoming under-ventilated...|$|E

A release rate model, taking pipeline operation properties and source release properties into account, is coupled with SLAB dispersion model and point source radiation model to calculate the hazard distance. The hazard distance is set beyond the distance at which a low chance of fatality can occur to people exposed and a wooden structure is not expected to burn due to radiation heat of <b>jet</b> <b>fire.</b> The comparison between three gases with different physico-chemical properties (i. e. natural gas, hydrogen, ethylene) is shown. The influence of pipeline operating parameters, such as: pressure, pipeline diameter and length, hole size, on the hazard area for the three gases is evaluated. Finally, a simple correlation is proposed for calculating the hazard distance as function of these parameters...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, safety {{distances}} around pipelines transmitting liquefied {{petroleum gas}} and pressurized natural gas are determined considering the possible outcomes of an accidental event associated with fuel gas release from pressurized transmission systems. Possible outcomes of an accidental fuel gas release were determined by performing the Event Tree Analysis approach. Safety distances were computed for two pipeline transmission systems of pressurized natural gas and {{liquefied petroleum gas}} existing in Greece using real data given by Greek Refineries and the Greek Public Gas Enterprise. The software packages CHETAH and BREEZE were used for thermochemical mixture properties estimation and quantitative consequence assessment, respectively. Safety distance determination was performed considering <b>jet</b> <b>fire</b> and gas dispersion to the lower flammable limit as the worst-case scenarios corresponding to immediate and delayed cloud ignition. The {{results showed that the}} <b>jet</b> <b>fire</b> scenario should be considered as the limiter for safety distances determination in the vicinity of natural and petroleum gas pipelines. Based on this conclusion, the obtained results were further treated to yield functional diagrams for prompt safety distance estimation. In addition, qualitative conclusions were made regarding the effect of atmospheric conditions on possible events. Thus, wind velocity was found to dominate during a <b>jet</b> <b>fire</b> event suppressing the thermal radiation effect, whereas gas dispersion was found to be affected mainly by solar radiation that favors the faster dissolution of fuel gas below the lower flammable limit.

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out on {{relatively}} large vertical propane sonic and subsonic exit velocity jet fires (up to approximately 10 m in length and 1. 5 m in width). The main geometrical features of jet fires (flame shape, length and width) were determined by analyzing infrared images. From the observations of visible and infrared images, the flame boundary was defined as that corresponding to a temperature of 800 K. Results were compared with the shapes proposed in previous research projects. In the present study, data for sonic and subsonic exit velocity flames indicated that a cylindrical shape could accurately describe {{the shape of a}} vertical propane <b>jet</b> <b>fire</b> in still air. The length of such a cylindrical <b>jet</b> <b>fire</b> was the radiant flame length and the equivalent diameter was that corresponding to a volume equal to that surrounded by the aforementioned boundary.

40|$|The safe {{design and}} {{operation}} of Process plants requires an ability to predict hazard consequences reliably. One particular hazard is a <b>jet</b> <b>fire</b> that might arise from the ignition of an accidental release of pressurised gas or liquid. On offshore gas and oil production platforms and also on land-based gas facilities, accidental releases might occur of high pressure natural gas sometimes containing higher molecular weight components. Industries continue to seek efficient and cost-effective means of protecting their plants and personnel from the hazards of fires. Following disasters which occurred in the past, the need for effective mitigation systems has, once again, been highlighted. Mitigation systems involving agents such as halons, which {{are perceived to be}} environmentally damaging, are currently out of favour and interest has revived in the use of water sprays. The research work presented here addresses the problem of the suppression of a compartment <b>jet</b> <b>fire</b> by water sprays. This involved studying the interaction between water spray and a turbulent jet flame inside a compartment of dimension 6 x 2. 4 x 2. 4 m 3. The fuel used for the <b>jet</b> <b>fire</b> was propane emerging from a 2. 0 cm diameter vertical nozzle and at a mass flow rate of 0. 1 kg/s. The objectives of the research are to investigate the mitigation of compartment jet fires by using water sprays by the application of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodology incorporating iv Summary combustion and a radiation model to study the <b>jet</b> <b>fire</b> behaviour and the temperature distribution in a compartment. In order to achieve the above objectives, it is necessary to produce a workable CFD model of an offshore module. The radiative heat exchange is considered in the modelling by using the Discrete Transfer Radiation Method (DTRM). The study of the sprays requires details of the individual drops' sizes. The Malvern Particle Sizer was used to measure the drop size of water sprays from the different spray nozzles which have been investigated in this study. The obtained drop sizes of the spray nozzles investigated are used to model the spray in FLUENT, which is a well developed CFD package used in industry and university research. The research started with the CFD modelling of the compartment fire, followed by experimental work done at the university laboratory at Buxton to validate the result of the modelling. In contrast to previous studies in which the combustion reaction was treated as a simple heat source this CFD has included a model of the combustion reaction. Comparisons are made between the experimental data and the predictions of different scenarios (i. e. steady state, different water spray arrangement and time dependent). The predicted temperature distributions from FLUENT, which includes radiation and surface heat transfer, are found to be in close agreement with the experimental data. Modelling results showed that the current version of the CFD code is able to provide a satisfactory and practical means of modelling <b>jet</b> <b>fire</b> and extinguishment processes...|$|E
40|$|This study {{takes place}} on a medium sized gas process plant called {{reference}} plant. In this thesis several escalation scenarios, as well as gas dispersion, is evaluated through Kameleon KFX and Vessfire. It has previously been conducted similar escalation studies. However, a normal approach to conduct these studies is to use reference values of a uniform property for heat flux both global and peak, and will only record/evaluate if rupture occurs. In this thesis uses every scenario transient curves for leak flow in KFX to represent the leak (<b>jet</b> <b>fire).</b> From these results individual values for heat flux, both peak and global, is found and used in Vessfire as heat flux exposure on process segment, to evaluate escalation and effect of blowdown. The effect of use of insulation, increased blowdown flow to vent stack and increased wall thickness is also evaluated in this thesis. How a <b>jet</b> <b>fire</b> develops could in some cases be dependent on the geometry of the process site. This is a factor that could get lost when using standardized values for exposure by fire (ref NORSOK S- 001). The results indicates that pressurized pipes with the given properties for carbon steel and utilization as used in reference plant (pipes {{in the range of}} 2 and 3 inch of diameter) is expected to rupture, when exposed to heat flux over 300 kW/m 2 over a time period of 2 to 3 minutes. With the restriction value for flow in the blowdown system today and an increase in flow of 50 %, blowdown alone will not prevent rupture of smaller pipe diameters when exposed as described above. However an increase in depressurization flow and a sequential blowdown philosophy, combined with early activation time for initiation of blowdown is proven to minimize the risk of escalation from one process train to another. When a <b>jet</b> <b>fire</b> passes objects the heat flux could increase on the other side as a result of increased turbulence. When a <b>jet</b> <b>fire</b> is directed into larger objects, the location of hot spots (peak flux values) on pipes and nearby equipment will not vary significantly, with time and strength in the release for the chosen scenarios. The values for global and peak flux will actually in some cases be almost constant. Objects can work as flame stabilizers. However, when the jet is unaffected by objects the hot spots could move over larger distances as the release flow decreases...|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this thesis has been to {{document}} that people can evacuate to temporarily safe locations / safe distances during the defined escalating <b>jet</b> <b>fire</b> scenario. It has been important to document that available evacuation time is longer than the required evacuation time. The required evacuation time has been documented in evacuation exercise and by Simulex simulations. The choice of fire scenario is a <b>jet</b> <b>fire</b> on 0, 3 kg/s. Jet fires are {{likely to occur in}} the processing area. It is assumed that this start fire after 2 minutes results in escalation, represented by a sudden increase to 10 - 30 kg/s. Relevant theory has been used in this thesis. Standards in Statoil`s library for standards and requirement was used. Simulex simulation tool has been used for the evacuation simulations because it is suitable for simulations {{with a small amount of}} people, as in processing modules at Kårstø. Excel has been used in the insulation and the BLEVE calculations. Program uncertainties when doing the simulations might affect the result. There can also be uncertainties in the measured time from the evacuation exercise. Uncertainties from the insulation calculations when putting the parameters into the excel sheet must be mentioned. The thesis includes detailed evaluations of how the safety barriers PS 8 Blowdown, PS 9 Active fire protection and PS 10 Passive fire protection influence escalation risk. Safety barriers need to be seen in combination to achieve personnel safety. Safety barriers can increase the margin between required and available time for evacuation. Unless hit by the start fire, the personnel will be able to escape a developing / escalating 0, 3 kg/s <b>jet</b> <b>fire,</b> both with respect to escalated <b>jet</b> <b>fire</b> exposure and with respect to development towards BLEVE. It will be important to be aware of the consequences from a BLEVE in the congested processing area where there are a lot of people working. Active and passive fire protection will increase time to rupture significantly and will thereby increase the margin between required and available evacuation time. Blow down may increase the margin by limiting the fire scenario. The positive effects of active fire protection and blow down are however dependent on early activation. There might be a need for changing the methodology and a change in the mindset when setting up a barrier philosophy. A deeper understanding of the whole risk picture and knowledge of the technically safety systems can contribute to make the best solution in a risk assessment. The uncertainties in the method will not affect the results appreciably. They will not affect the main conclusion...|$|E
