5|$|According to {{the comic}} book series Haunted, Adam was once a human member of the Initiative tasked with {{protecting}} Professor Walsh. The ghost of Mayor Richard Wilkins, however, took over {{the body of a}} vampire, which was then captured by the Initiative. Desperate to escape, the Mayor moved to the body of a dead demon and killed Adam. Having been one of her favorite agents, Professor Walsh vowed to bring him back to life and placed <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>in</b> her 314 Project. However, due to the complex nature of the Buffyverse, this chain of events may not, in fact, be canonical.|$|E
5|$|Bhagavata Purana further {{states that}} Prithu {{performed}} ninety-nine ashwamedha yagnas (horse-sacrifices), but Indra, kings of the demi-gods, disturbed Prithu's hundredth one.

It also {{states that the}} Four Kumaras, the four sage-incarnations of Vishnu, preached Prithu about devotion to Vishnu. After governing his kingdom for a long time, Prithu left with his wife Archi, to perform penance in the forest in his last days. He experienced Samadhi and voluntarily gave up <b>his</b> <b>body</b> <b>in</b> the forest, and Archi went Sati on his funeral pyre.|$|E

In his efforts to renew the Roman Empire, Justinian dangerously stretched its resources while failing {{to take into account the}} changed realities of 6th-century Europe.|$|E
