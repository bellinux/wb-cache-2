It is also available at: [URL] dimer method with the Ackland EAM potential has been used to determine the diffusion mechanisms of isolated defects in the bulk of α-Fe. Three <b>defect</b> <b>systems</b> were studied, an isolated vacancy, a P-vacancy complex and a P interstitial defect. Using an event table consisting of the transitions found using the dimer method, the kinetic Monte Carlo method has been used to simulate the diffusion of these defects. Periodic boundary conditions were used to simulate Fe crystals with finite concentrations of P atoms between 0. 006 at. % and 0. 038 at. %. At lower temperatures of around 350 K, substitutional P atoms in Fe act as centers of attraction for vacancy defects, such that the defect moves as a P-vacancy complex for most of the time. However, as the temperature is increased, the phosphorus atom and the vacancy spend greater amounts of time dissociated. We found that P interstitial defects can also diffuse through the lattice. Diffusion constants have been calculated for these systems at various temperatures and P concentrations. These showed that an Fe-P dumbbell is the most mobile of these <b>defect</b> <b>systems</b> and a P-vacancy complex the least mobile. For the isolated vacancy and P interstitial <b>defect</b> <b>systems,</b> the diffusion constant was found to satisfy the Arrhenius relation; the P-vacancy complex, however, showed a deviation from this relation...|$|R

The inability to rapidly and effectively passivate boron-oxygen defects is primarily due to the unavailability of the defects for passivation, rather than any “weakness” of the passivation reaction. The theoretical long-term stability of modules in the field is investigated as a worst-case scenario using typical meteorological year data and the System Advisor Model (SAM). With effective mounting of the modules, the modelling indicates that even in desert locations, destabilisation of the passivation is no concern within 40 years.

Novel 'perturbation extrapolation' is utilized to extend the use of the computationally expensive HSE functional to this large-scale <b>defect</b> <b>system.</b> According to calculations, the formation energy of charged phosphorus interstitial defects are very low in n-type $Zn_ 3 P_ 2 $ and act as 'electron sinks', nullifying the desired doping and lowering the fermi-level back towards the p-type regime.

40|$|The {{results for}} {{external}} quantum efficiency degradation of two types of light emitting diodes based on III-nitrides: blue and ultraviolet ones are presented. Existing mechanisms proposed for the degradation are considered briefly. Applying several techniques for studying the light emitting diodes at various stages of the aging test gives the possibility to reveal a new mechanism of defects formations with a help of multi-phonon recombination of carriers in an extended <b>defects</b> <b>system</b> and in local regions of random alloy fluctuations. These techniques include analysis of current voltage characteristics evolution at V< 2 V, the low frequency noise methods, and infrared microscopy. The multi-phonon recombination of carriers is accomplished by generation of native defects, in particular, In- or Ga-atoms and their migration. These processes lead to modification of the extended <b>defects</b> <b>system</b> properties and local composition of InGaN alloys in several regions that result in decreasing of the carriers participating in a radiative recombination and degradation of the {{external quantum efficiency}}.
