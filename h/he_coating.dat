40|$|CoNiCrAlY {{has been}} cold sprayed onto 316 L {{substrate}} using helium and nitrogen as carrier gases. CGDS with helium gas under {{the temperature of}} 400 A degrees C and pressure of 20 bars and CGDS with nitrogen gas under the temperature of 450 A degrees C and pressure of 38 bars were used. The {{purpose of the current}} study was to investigate the microstructure and oxidation behavior of CoNiCrAlY coatings deposited by CGDS technique with both carrier gases. The quality of the as-sprayed and oxidized bond coats was assessed and investigated {{from the point of view}} of microstructural (porosity and oxide concentration) and mechanical properties (hardness) characteristics. Sprayed samples were exposed to isothermal oxidation at 900 A degrees C in air. Oxide growth rates were obtained from a series of mass gain measurement while oxide scale compositions were determined using SEM, XRD and EDX analysis. Helium processing condition displays more compact structure for the coating when compared to N- 2. The oxide scale on the CGDS sprayed with <b>He</b> <b>coating</b> after 1, 000 h of oxidation is composed of alumina without the presence of detrimental fast growing mixed oxides. Results obtained in this study show that CGDS sprayed with N- 2 coating features high levels of visible defects, oxide content, spinal-type oxide and high oxide growth rate, whereas CGDS with He shows low oxide growth rate due to low porosity and oxide content...|$|E
40|$|Polyethylene flame-protected {{coatings}} {{are known}} to have good reliabi-lty, chemical resistance, insulating characteristics and prevent the metal form corrosion. In real use, however, there is a danger of da-mage or eXfoliation of the coating resulting in a clearance between t <b>he</b> <b>coating</b> and the metal. Atmosphere-induced wa~hout of the coating components in this case stimUlate their agg~ega(ion on the metal sur face which may cause. its corrosion. The POS~ibility of reducitig cor-rosivity of the polyethylene coating containing the product of inter-action of polyvinyl alcohol and methylphosphonic acid as a. f l ame retadant additive by means of heterocyclic amine is studied in the paper. To,s t i rnu l a t. e the corrosive processes on a metal coating inter-face corrosive and polarisation measurements have been performed. It has been found ~hat the degree of extract coating corrosion is deter-mined by the t on c en t r a t i on of methylphosphonic acid facilitating anode and cathode pr~cesses. The introduction of heterocyclic amine into a flame-retardant polyethylene promotes the retardation of both electrode processes, its ifluence on the anodic process being greater. The inhibiting effect of heterocyclic amine is supposed to be connected With the appearance of an additional absorption potential. In this case the effectiveness of heterocyclic amine decreases With pH icrease and this 'ma y be connected with the concurrence in the adsorption of hydroxyl and amine on the surface of iron [...] The conclusion of the possibilty to use the inhibito~s of acid corrosion for the decrease of flame retardant coating corrosivity has been made.

50|$|Guerrero batted without wearing batting gloves, {{a custom}} rarely seen in modern baseball. In an {{interview}} with Yahoo!

Plasma treatment was used to improve binding of coatings over the surface. He investigated in detail, the factors responsible for adhesion improvement using XPS, AFM, SEM, contact angle, abrasion tests and conductivity measurements. Different plasma gases, plasma power and plasma modes were investigated to get optimum bonding data. His investigations pointed towards improved surface oxygen functionalization and suitable surface morphology for improved bonding...|$|R
50|$|According to Pucher's {{records of}} his {{photographic}} process, <b>he</b> <b>coated</b> a small glass {{plate with a}} layer of light-sensitive sulfur, exposed it to iodine vapors, and inserted the prepared plate into a camera. He then poured mercury into a metal container, placed the mercury {{at the bottom of the}} camera, and heated it from below. He exposed the prepared plate to light for 15 seconds, and mercury vapors coated the exposed places on the picture. Pucher strengthened the picture with bromine steam and fixed it by wrapping it with alcohol. Finally, he preserved the photo with varnish.|$|R
