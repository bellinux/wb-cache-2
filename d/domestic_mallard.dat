50|$|Though in {{many ways}} similar, the Australian Poultry Standard Committee {{considers}} the Call ducks present in Australia a separate breed to the Call duck {{of the rest of}} the world, citing evidence of its independent development in South Australia as a mutation in <b>domestic</b> <b>Mallard</b> flocks belonging to Hamish Russel. The committee therefore put into motion a renaming of the breed for the 2nd edition, 2011, of their standard. The Australian Poultry Standards states in its introduction of the Australian Call that the breed is noticeable larger and has a different colour range to North American Calls.|$|E
40|$|Domestic duck {{production}} plays {{a very important}} role in producing meat, eggs and down. To support the conservation of closely related species of wild Mallard as well as Muscovy ducks and to understand the origin, domestication process, genetic diversity as well as differentiation of domestic ducks, the partial D-loop sequence of mitochondrial DNA has been employed as the most popular molecular marker. In this study, a total of four pairs of primers located in different D-loop portions were used to amplify and sequence the partial D-loop fragment from definite <b>domestic</b> <b>Mallard</b> and Muscovy ducks together with domestic duck samples of unknown species of origin. Intensive sequencing profiles identified a homoplasmic D-loop in domestic Muscovy ducks but ‘heteroplasmic’ mtDNA D-loop fragments in <b>domestic</b> <b>Mallard</b> ducks. The results supported the presence of Numts in blood samples of <b>domestic</b> <b>Mallard</b> duck. This phenomenon has not been recognized or reported before and it can certainly confound the application of D-loop sequence as a molecular marker to genetic study of <b>domestic</b> <b>Mallard</b> duck. Further investigation on tissue specificity of the Numts and establishment of specific primers to generate the true D-loop sequences are warranted for an accurate genetic characterization and species identification of domestic ducks...|$|E

40|$|Hybridisation between closely-related {{species is}} an ongoing threat to many species that can be {{exacerbated}} by anthropogenic practices. The Pacific Black Duck (Anas superciliosa) is a dabbling duck native to the southwest Pacific that is currently under threat of hybridisation with introduced Mallard (A. platyrhynchos). Mallard are known to hybridise with and threaten many other dabbling duck species throughout the world.

40|$|ABSTRACT Contraception {{may provide}} a useful nonle-thal {{management}} tool to reduce wild bird populations. We tested the efficacy of nicarbazin (NCZ) as a contracep-tive for waterfowl and assessed health effects of NCZ, using <b>domestic</b> <b>mallards</b> (Anas platyrhynchos) {{as a model for}} Canada geese (Branta canadensis). Mallards were given gelatin capsules containing 0, 8. 5, 17. 0, or 33. 75 mg of NCZ/kg of BW perorally once daily for 14 d. Fecal 4, 4 ′-dinitrocarbanilide (DNC) and fluorescein were evaluated as potential markers of plasma and egg DNC levels. Plasma, egg, and fecal DNC levels differed among treat-ment groups in a dose response relationship. There were no significant effects on the numbers of eggs laid per female per day, proportion of fertile eggs, proportion of eggs hatching, or egg yolk mottling.

We tested the efficacy of nicarbazin (NCZ) as a contraceptive for waterfowl and assessed health effects of NCZ, using <b>domestic</b> <b>mallards</b> (Anas platyrhynchos) {{as a model for}} Canada geese (Branta canadensis). Mallards were given gelatin capsules containing 0, 8. 5, 17. 0, or 33. 75 mg of NCZ/kg of BW perorally once daily for 14 d. Fecal 4, 4 ′- dinitrocarbanilide (DNC) and fluorescein were evaluated as potential markers of plasma and egg DNC levels. Plasma, egg, and fecal DNC levels differed among treatment groups in a dose response relationship. There were no significant effects on the numbers of eggs laid per female per day, proportion of fertile eggs, proportion of eggs hatching, or egg yolk mottling. Hatchability was 0. 55 ± 0. 1 in the control group compared with 0. 26 ± 0. 1 in the 33. 75 mg/kg of BW group. Degeneration of the vitelline membrane was evident at all treatment levels; severity was dose-related and greater in the outer vitelline membrane than the inner vitelline membrane. No significant health effects were observed for birds treated with NCZ. The heterophil:lymphocyte ratio was elevated during the treatment and posttreatment periods in all groups, indicating birds were experiencing stress due to handling. Fecal DNC levels did not correlate well with plasma DNC levels, likely due to NCZ being administered as a bolus dose rather than being fed ad libitum. Fluorescein correlated well with plasma DNC levels during the treatment period and can therefore be used successfully as a noninvasive marker to determine the approximate amount of NCZ a bird is consuming. As a contraceptive, NCZ likely would have minimal adverse health effects on the target animal, although field studies with the species of interest need to be conducted. Further research using higher NCZ levels needs to be conducted to determine whether NCZ can inhibit reproduction in waterfowl...|$|R

5|$|Mallard {{have had}} a long {{relationship}} with humans. Almost all domestic duck breeds derive from the mallard, {{with the exception of}} a few Muscovy breeds. Mallards are generally monogamous while domestic ducks are mostly polygamous. Domestic ducks have no territorial behaviour and are less aggressive than <b>mallards.</b> <b>Domestic</b> ducks are mostly kept for meat, as their eggs have a strong flavor. They were first domesticated in Southeast Asia at least 4000 years ago, during the Neolithic Age, and were also farmed by the Romans in Europe, and the Malays in Asia. It is also common for mallards to mate with domestic ducks and produce hybrid offspring that are fully fertile. Due to this, mallards have been found to be contaminated with the genes of the domestic duck.|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} removal of seabird {{carcasses}} by scavengers after the M/V Kure oil spill in California and the M/V New Carissa spill in Oregon. The experimental design consisted of placing carcasses in randomized locations along the shoreline and returning at daily intervals to evaluate their condition. We placed 25 carcasses at each of four sites in Oregon near Coos Bay and Waldport and six sites in California in and around Humboldt Bay, {{for a total of}} 250 carcasses distributed along 25 km of coastline. Small birds (≤ 521 g) disappeared significantly faster than did large birds (> 521 g) at the California sites, where the carcass removal rate over the first 24 hours ranged from 66 % to 78 %. Carcass removal rates varied significantly between sites in California, but not in Oregon. The daily rate of carcass removal tended to change over time, decreasing for small birds, but increasing for large birds. <b>Domestic</b> waterfowl (<b>Mallard</b> Ducks Anas platyrhynchos) were removed more rapidly than were seabirds, but removal of wild passerines did not appear to differ from that of seabirds in that regard.

40|$|International audienceAbstract Today one of {{the most}} {{convenient}} methods for the identification of animal species in processed meat products is examination of the DNA sequence. Especially real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) techniques are suitable because even small fragments of DNA formed during heat processing of the meat can still be amplified and identified. In this study a real-time PCR method has been developed and evaluated for the identification of processed meat products. In test mixtures containing beef, pork, horse, mutton, chicken and turkey it was possible to identify these species down to a level of 0. 05 %. By adjusting the number of cycles it was possible to detect levels as low as 0. 01 % of these species. Cross-reactivity between these species was not found, except for pure horsemeat (250 ng DNA) in the assay for turkey meat. Cross-reactivity of deer, roe, ostrich, kangaroo, goat, <b>domestic</b> duck, <b>mallard,</b> goose, pigeon, guinea fowl, quail and pheasant was also investigated and it was found that amounts as high as 250 ng DNA of these species in the reaction vial did not result in (false) positive signals except for amounts higher than 125 ng deer DNA and higher than 50 ng pigeon DNA in the determination of respectively chicken and beef. More than 150 meat samples were examined using DNA-hybridization and the real-time PCR.

40|$|An {{outbreak}} of highly pathogenic avian influenza, {{caused by a}} novel reassortant influenza A (H 5 N 8) virus, occurred among poultry and wild birds in South Korea in 2014.

Three of the viruses had similar pathogenicity among infected domestic ducks: the H 5 N 8 viruses were moderately pathogenic (0 %- 20 % mortality rate); in wild mallard ducks, the H 5 N 8 and H 5 N 1 viruses did not cause severe illness or death; viral replication and shedding were greater in H 5 N 8 -infected mallards than in H 5 N 1 -infected mallards. Identification of H 5 N 8 viruses in birds exposed to infected <b>domestic</b> ducks and <b>mallards</b> indicated that the viruses could spread by contact.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with two strigeid genera which utilise fish as their second intermediate host and piscivorous birds as a definitive host, i. e. Apatemon (Apatemon) Sudarikov, 1959 and Ichthyocotylurus Odening, 1969. Although the lifecycle has been ascertained for most Ichthyocotylurus spp., confusion and disagreement still exist as to the constituent species, while all of the life-stages have been described for only a single member of the subgenus Apatemon (Apatemon). In order to clarify species membership to these taxa and indeed the taxonomic position of the subgenus Apatemon (Apatemon) further information was required on the life-cycles and life-stages of these strigeids. Although, metacercariae from this family have been recorded {{from a variety of}} British fishes, confirmed records, i. e. those supported with life-cycle data, are limited to a single species. It was this lack of confidence in identifying metacercariae recovered from fishes and the lack of known good criteria for distinguishing the adults that prompted the present study. Collections of metacercariae from a variety of hosts and locations were made, from which all subsequent life-cycle stages were obtained. The project aims were to establish the identity of the forms occurring in British fishes, by applying discriminatory techniques to the experimentally reared life-stages. In addition to traditional methods, techniques with little previous application to these genera were used and included, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), chaetotaxy, principal components analysis (PCA), and karyology. Furthermore, behavioural aspects such as the release patterns of cercariae from their molluscan hosts were studied to investigate whether they would prove to be of diagnostic value. Metacercariae obtained from the sampling survey were tentatively identified, using all currently employed methods for their determination, i. e. morphology, nature of cyst, host and site specificities, as Ichthyocotylurus erraticus (Rudolphi, 1809), I. variegatus (Creplin, 1825), Apatemon gracilis (Rudolphi, 1819) and A. annuligerum (Nordmann, 1832). Material collected from Finland was considered to contain both Ichthyocotylurus spp. recovered in the U. K., as well as I. platycephalus (Creplin, 1825) and I. pileatus (Rudolphi, 1802). The Ichthyocotylurus spp. were found to be more host specific than A. gracilis, although A. annuligerum was considered oioxenic to perch Perea fluiatilis L. Records of I. erraticus from gwyniad Coregonus lavaretus (L.) and grayling Thymallus thymallus (L.), and A. gracilis from arctic charr Salvelinus alpinus (L.) constitute first listings from Britain. The large number of sensilla present on the body surface of these metacercariae, observed by SEM and chaetotaxy, precluded their diagnostic use. PCA was, however, found to be of value for distinguishing between species and determining morphological variation within a species. I. erraticus, I. variegatus and A. gracilis adults were successfully reared in experimental hosts using metacercariae from a variety of fish hosts, sites within a single fish host and geographical sites. The adults obtained enabled clarification of the identities assigned to the metacercariae. Those metacercariae believed to represent I. pileatus and A. annuligerum failed to establish in experimental hosts. Herring gulls and lesser black-backed gulls proved to be extremely good experimental hosts for both Ichthyocotylurus spp., with the vast majority of infections establishing and providing high yields of eggs and adults. These infections yielded information on the establishment, development, fecundity, site specificity, longevity and morphological variability of the adults. Aspects of the morphology and biology of I. variegatus adults recorded were found to support its validity as a species discrete from I. platycephalus which was in some doubt. The experimental hosts used for A. gracilis infections, <b>domestic</b> and <b>mallard</b> ducklings, were found to be less satisfactory. Challenges were performed with A. gracilis metacercariae from three sources, rainbow trout, salmon parr and stone loach. The latter source was the only one to result in egg producing adults, with specimens exhibiting normal morphology and demonstrating an increased longevity over adults raised from salmonid metacercariae. These findings suggest that the metacercarial host may affect the successful completion of the life-cycle. Eggs of known origin were collected for all three cultured strigeid species, enabling further life-cycle studies, these were incubated and miracidia successfully raised. Developmental periods were found to be temperature dependent and differed for the three species at 20 °C: A. gracilis < I. erraticus < I. variegatus. Light microscopy revealed the morphology of all three species to be identical, as were the epidermal plate formulae and chaetotaxy, indicated by silver-staining. The nomenclature for the distribution of miracidial sensilla derived by Dimitrov et al. (1989) was amended to enable a full description of these species. Osmotic shock resulted in an improved deciliation of the miracidia compared to sonication and subsequent SEM observation confirmed the arrangement of body surface structures, while revealing sensilla forms. Behavioural aspects of I. variegatus miracidia were examined, with a maximum longevity (< 11 hours) recorded at the lowest temperature studied (l 0 degrees C), and host finding demonstrated to occur by an increased turning response in the presence of substances emitted from the susceptible snail host, following an initial unresponsive dispersal phase. Ichthyocotylurus cercariae were found in naturally infected Valvata piscinalis which constitutes the first record in Britain of cercariae of this genus. Cercariae of I. erraticus and I. variegatus were successfully raised experimentally from miracidia of known identity and origin within naive, experimentally raised V. piscinalis hosts, while A. gracilis cercariae were obtained from laboratory reared Lymnaea peregra. Cercarial developmental periods within the molluscan host were found to be temperature dependent and markedly different for the strigeid genera investigated, as were their behaviour and morphology. The Ichthyocotylurus spp. exhibit a distinct diurnal emergence rhythm from their molluscan host, being shed during the hours of daylight, while A. gracilis cercariae demonstrate a reciprocal pattern, emerging during the hours of darkness. Behavioural contrasts were also observed in longevities, emergence strategies (route of exit) and swimming behaviour. The two Ichthyocotylurus spp. were extremely similar, the only cercarial features found to be of diagnostic use were: {{the presence or absence of}} eye-spots; their differing developmental periods from miracidium to cercaria; the number and distribution of sensilla when compared by PCA; and their differing longevities at 20 degrees C. Characters considered to be of value in differentiating between strigeid cercariae at the species level, including the armature, chaetotaxy pattern and resting posture, did not differ between these two species. SEM observations enabled descriptions of the variety and structure of sensilla present on different life-stages, while transmission electron microscopy revealed the internal structure of cercarial sensory structures. Experimentally raised cercariae were found to be infective and the life-cycle was completed for the three strigeid species. Host specificities were observed for I. erraticus and A. gracilis, being particularly stringent for the latter species, while site specificities recorded were as observed in natural infections. Metacercarial maturation periods (for encystment) were highly temperature dependent, being comparable for the two Ichthyocotylurus spp. and more rapid than for A. gracilis specimens. Karyological studies were performed on the cercariae-releasing parthenitae of I. erraticus, I. variegatus and A. gracilis, the identity of which was confirmed through lifecycle studies. The chromosome number and morphology for the three species was described and enabled the ready discrimination of I. erraticus and I. variegatus cercariae which had proved to be problematical using comparisons of gross morphology. The strigeids described here and from all other sources have been found to possess 20 chromosomes in diploid sets. Behavioural and developmental characteristics were found to be of taxonomic value for the separation of morphologically similar species at all life-stages. The fine surface structures of the strigeids investigated using SEM and chaetotaxy revealed many similarities at the species level, but provided evidence for their use in the separation of higher taxa. All comparisons of morphology were enhanced by the ability of PCA to discern subtle variation while karyological investigations provided precise species determinations. The two latter techniques in particular may greatly aid systematicians investigating taxonomic problems within other digenean families...|$|R
