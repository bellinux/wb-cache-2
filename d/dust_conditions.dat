The distributions were measured under different <b>dust</b> <b>conditions</b> (background, floating dust, blowing dust, and dust storm) and statistical analyses were performed. The results showed that, under different <b>dust</b> <b>conditions,</b> the instantaneous number concentrations of dust particles differed widely.

40|$|Metal dusting {{leads to}} {{disintegration}} of such alloys as iron and nickel-based into a “dust” of particulate metal, metal carbide, carbon, and/or oxide. It occurs in strongly carburising environments at 400 - 900 °C. Literature survey {{has shown that}} alloys behave differently in metal <b>dusting</b> <b>conditions</b> based on their composition and the environment. Metal dusting mechanisms for iron and nickel-based alloys have been proposed but, nevertheless, have not been agreed upon and numerous modifications to them have been suggested. Further adding to the complexity, the mechanisms {{were found to have}} differed due to operating condition alterations. In view of that, this research was carried out {{to gain a better understanding}} of metal dusting process(s) by evaluating the performance of heat-resistant alloys, namely KHR 35 C HiSi© (HP), KHR 45 A LC© (35 Cr- 45 Ni), and UCX©, in metal <b>dusting</b> <b>conditions.</b> HP, which is an iron-based alloy, was modified by adding more silicon in order to improve its resistance through the development of SiO 2 at the surface. The carbon content in the nickel-based alloy, 35 Cr- 45 Ni, was lowered to delay the attack onset by accommodating more diffused carbon. UCX©, however, has the highest nickel and chromium levels. The alloys were exposed to a gas containing 80 vol% CO+ 20 vol% H 2 at 650, 750, and 850 ºC for 100, 500, and 1000 h. Analyses including visual inspection, XRD, and SEM/EDX revealed that the alloys suffered localised attacks at the three temperatures but to varying degrees and in different shapes. In general, the attack initiated at the matrix rather than the primary carbides and also progressed through the matrix. Increasing the exposure temperature caused less carbon deposition and more oxides formation on the alloy surfaces leading to a reduction in the attack aggressiveness. UCX© exhibited the highest resistance to metal dusting whilst HP suffered the severest attack. The presence of high concentrations of chromium at the surface catalysed a quick formation of Cr 2 O 3 scale that reduced the extent of metal dusting. Also, the increase in nickel content might have slowed down the carbon diffusion into the alloy. In addition, the presence of other oxide and carbide-forming elements such as silicon and tungsten might well have enhanced the alloy performance. Diffused carbon binds with free tungsten, niobium, and chromium to form carbides prolonging the incubation period prior to the attack initiation.
