25|$|Various {{experiments}} {{document that}} changes in {{the conditions under which}} the dance is performed lead to characteristic changes in recruitment to <b>external</b> <b>resources,</b> {{in a manner consistent with}} von Frisch's original conclusions. Experiments with robotic dummies were indeed to induce some recruitment, which should not have been possible if the dance contains no information. Various experimental results demonstrate that the dance does convey information, but the use of this information may be context-dependent, and this may explain why the results of earlier studies were inconsistent. Researchers have also discovered other forms of honeybee dance communication, such as the tremble dance.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the elements above, another important feature of SBML is that every entity can have machine-readable annotations attached to it. These annotations {{can be used to}} express relationships between the entities in a given model and entities in <b>external</b> <b>resources</b> such as databases. A good example of the value of this is in BioModels Database, where every model is annotated and linked to relevant data resources such as publications, databases of compounds and pathways, controlled vocabularies, and more. With annotations, a model becomes more than simply a rendition of a mathematical construct—it becomes a semantically-enriched framework for communicating knowledge.|$|E
2500|$|Cohen {{argues that}} the concept of self-ownership is {{favourable}} to Rawls's difference principle as it ensures [...] "each person's rights over his being and powers" [...] — i.e. that one is treated as an end always and never as a means — but also highlights that its centrality provides for an area of common ground between the Marxist account of justice and the right-libertarianism of Robert Nozick. However, much as Cohen criticises Rawls for treating people's personal powers as just another external resource for which no individual can claim desert, so does he charge Nozick with moving beyond the concept of self-ownership to his own right-wing [...] "thesis" [...] of self-ownership. In Cohen's view, Nozick's mistake is to endow people's claims to legitimately acquire <b>external</b> <b>resources</b> with the same moral quality that belongs to people's ownership of themselves. In other words, proprietarianism allows inequalities to arise from differences in talent and differences in <b>external</b> <b>resources,</b> but it does so because it assumes that the world is [...] "up for grabs", [...] that it can be justly appropriated as private property, with virtually no restriction(s).|$|E

40|$|<b>External</b> <b>resource</b> {{acquisition}} (ERA), {{the strategic}} action to acquire critical resources, {{has been a}} core activity for firm survival. We challenge the resource-based rationale of most current ERA studies that firms’ strategic actions are solely directed by their resource endowments- and propose instead that it is top managers’ interpretations of their competitive environment driving firms to engage in ERA. We draw upon the upper echelons perspective to unpack the processes through which top managers take <b>external</b> <b>resource</b> acquisition decisions when faced with resource-related actions by their competitors. Using insights from the biopharmaceutical industry, we suggest that ERA behavior {{is more complex than}} previously assumed and develop a multi-level conceptual framework that provides firm- and TMT-level explanations of ERA patterns among competing firms...|$|R
