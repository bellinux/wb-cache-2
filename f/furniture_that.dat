5|$|Before the Tang Dynasty (618907 AD), the {{predominant}} sitting {{positions in the}} Han Chinese culture and neighboring cultures such as the Japanese Culture, Korean Culture, Turkic Culture in Central Asia and Tai Kadai Cultures to the southwest were the seiza and lotus position on the floor or sitting mats. The earliest images of chairs in China are from sixth-century Buddhist murals and stele, but the practice of sitting in chairs {{at that time was}} rare. It was not until the twelfth century that chairs became widespread in China. Scholars disagree on the reasons for the adoption of the chair. The most common theories are that the chair was an outgrowth of indigenous Chinese <b>furniture,</b> <b>that</b> it evolved from a camp stool imported from Central Asia, that it was introduced to China by Nestorian missionaries in the seventh century, and that the chair came to China from India as a form of Buddhist monastic furniture. In modern China, unlike Korea or Japan, it is not common to sit at floor level.|$|E

25|$|The Mahantongo Valley {{aesthetic}} {{has been}} explored in various recent studies, {{particularly those of}} Frederick S.

They described the highly distinctive <b>furniture</b> <b>that</b> had been created between 1798 and 1828 along the Schwaben Creek Area of the Mahantongo Valley. The decorative furniture of the region has also been featured in national publications such as Early American Homes.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Weber wrote his essay, he {{believed}} that the religious underpinnings of the Protestant ethic had largely gone from society. He cited the writings of Benjamin Franklin, which emphasized frugality, hard work and thrift, but were mostly free of spiritual content. Weber also attributed the success of mass production partly to the Protestant ethic. Only after expensive luxuries were disdained could individuals accept the uniform products, such as clothes and <b>furniture,</b> <b>that</b> industrialization offered.|$|E

25|$|Even {{though both}} plants were busy during the war, {{the company did}} not prosper in the forties due to {{shortages}} of lumber and labor as the country's workforce went to war. Minutes of the 1946 stockholders' meeting show the company's lumber inventory had been reduced, from over 3 million board feet in 1942, to just over a million in 1946. After the war, there was pent-up demand not only for boxes and crates, but also for <b>furniture</b> <b>that</b> the Tacoma plant had been producing. The company expanded to produce box-springs, and began an effort to improve handling of lumber to be kiln-dried. Both plants also continued to replace aging steam engines and boilers with electrical mill machinery. But there were no dividends distributed to stockholders for 1946. The trends of the decade were higher wages, shortages of materials, higher prices, and heavy competition, especially from local non-unionized factories.|$|E
500|$|A {{select few}} scenes disrupt the Expressionistic {{style of the}} film, such as in Jane's and Alan's home, which include normal {{backgrounds}} and bourgeois <b>furniture</b> <b>that</b> {{convey a sense of}} security and tranquility otherwise absent from the film. Eisner called this a [...] "fatal" [...] continuity error, but John D. Barlow disagrees, arguing it is a common characteristic for dream narratives to have some normal elements in them, and that the normalcy of Jane's house in particular could represent the feeling of comfort and refuge Francis feels in her presence. Mike Budd argues while the Expressionistic visual style is jarring and off-putting at first, the characters start to blend more harmoniously as the film progresses, and the setting becomes more relegated into the background.|$|E
500|$|There {{were many}} successes for the departments, {{and they were}} to {{influence}} future design thinking. At the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes in Paris, the Soviet pavilion by Konstantin Melnikov and its contents attracted both criticism and praise for its economic and working class architecture. One focus of criticism was the [...] "nakedness" [...] of the structure, in comparison to other luxurious pavilions such as that by Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann. Alexander Rodchenko designed a worker's club, and the <b>furniture</b> <b>that</b> the Wood and Metal Working Faculty (Дерметфак) contributed was an international success. The student work won several prizes, and Melnikov's pavilion won the Grand Prix. As {{a new generation of}} artist/designers, the students and faculty at Vkhutemas paved the way for designer furniture by architects such as Marcel Breuer, and Alvar Aalto later in the century.|$|E

500|$|On Sint Maarten, {{officials}} advised {{residents to}} start all necessary actions {{to prepare for a}} hurricane. Residents were told to clear their yards of any debris or lose <b>furniture</b> <b>that</b> could become airborne during the storm, place shutters over windows and doors and assist elderly neighbors with shuttering their homes, and mariners should find a safe haven. A curfew from 10:00p.m. on October15 to 10:00a.m. on October16 was put in place. Due to the possibility of flash flooding, residents were to unclog and free up all waterways around their homes. Officials also warned people to stay away from areas prone to landslides until the [...] "all-clear" [...] was given. Owners of livestock were advised to have insured that they were secured in holding areas. As a precaution, the water supply would be shut down from 8:00p.m. October15 to 8:00a.m. October16. Four public areas, St. Peters Community Center, Dutch Quarter Community Center, Genevieve de Weever School, and the Salvation Army building would be used as emergency shelters.|$|E
500|$|George V {{continued}} {{a process}} of more gradual modernisation, assisted by his wife, Mary of Teck, who had {{a strong interest in}} furniture and decoration. Mary sought out and re-acquired items of <b>furniture</b> <b>that</b> had been lost or sold from the castle, including many dispersed by Edward VII, and also acquired many new works of art to furnish the state rooms. Queen Mary was also a lover of all things miniature, and a famous dolls' house was created for her at Windsor Castle, designed by the architect Edwin Lutyens and furnished by leading craftsmen and designers of the 1930s. George V was committed to maintaining a high standard of court life at Windsor Castle, adopting the motto that everything was to be [...] "of the best". A large staff was still kept at the castle, with around 660servants working in the property during the period. Meanwhile, during the First World War, anti-German feeling led the members of the Royal Family to change their dynastic name from the German House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha; George decided to take the new name from the castle, and the Royal Family became the House of Windsor in 1917.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} the first to be filmed, in September 2010. It was mainly filmed on a council estate in Bath, Somerset, while the scenes in the dollhouse were filmed in Dyrham Park. The Bristol estate was chosen because of its [...] "crisp architecture". The country house of Dyrham Park was chosen because of its {{staircase}} and checked flooring. The antiques were stripped out of the building and replaced with [...] "child-like" [...] <b>furniture</b> <b>that</b> was placed to look {{as though it had been}} played with. Several designs of the dolls were made, trying to achieve the desired balance of a normal doll and a scarier, more [...] "crude"-looking one. The actors portraying the dolls were choreographed to move with stiff legs but swing their arms. In the scene in which Alex and the Doctor are in the kitchen they open and close the fridge as they are talking; this was not in the script, but improvised by Smith and Mays on set. Mays was invited to guest-star in the episode, and was drawn to the story because of the family element; he has a young son like George. The scene in which Purcell sinks into the carpet was filmed with actor Andrew Tiernan on a hydraulic platform that lowered him into green-coloured liquid.|$|E
