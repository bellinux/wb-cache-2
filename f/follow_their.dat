5|$|In his preface, Merrifield {{noted that}} while archaeologists {{studying}} prehistoric periods have paid increasing {{attention to the}} evidence for ritual and magic in the archaeological record, their counterparts working in later historical periods have failed to <b>follow</b> <b>their</b> lead. Presenting this book as a rectifier, he outlines his intentions and the study's limitations.|$|E
5|$|Surf Ninjas is a 1993 American family comedy film {{involving}} martial arts, {{directed by}} Neal Israel and written by Dan Gordon. The film stars Ernie Reyes, Jr., Rob Schneider, Nicolas Cowan and Leslie Nielsen. Surf Ninjas follows two teenage surfers from Los Angeles who {{discover that they}} are crown princes of the Asian kingdom Patusan and reluctantly <b>follow</b> <b>their</b> destinies to dethrone an evil colonel that rules over the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The 2003–04 Slovenian Cup was {{the last}} trophy won by Maribor before the darkest era of the club began. Between 2004 and 2008, the club was plagued by {{financial}} difficulties, and Maribor even came close to being disbanded at one point. However, the club did not <b>follow</b> <b>their</b> rivals Olimpija and Mura on that path.|$|E

5|$|The common {{soldiers}} fought bravely at first, {{but they}} were saddled with low pay (with which they had to purchase their own food and medical care), ammunition shortages, and mixed equipment. Due to the pay system, there were no allotments for their families, who were, therefore, forced to <b>follow</b> <b>their</b> husbands/sons into the battle zones. These problems (exacerbated by continuously declining morale) only increased over time.|$|E
5|$|Today, {{football}} is played at a professional level {{all over the}} world. Millions of people regularly go to football stadiums to <b>follow</b> <b>their</b> favourite teams, while billions more watch the game on television or on the internet. A {{very large number of}} people also play football at an amateur level. According to a survey conducted by FIFA published in 2001, over 240 million people from more than 200 countries regularly play football. Football has the highest global television audience in sport.|$|E
5|$|Cornwall, {{represented}} by the Cornwall Commonwealth Games Association (CCGA), sent a bid {{for participation in the}} 2006 Commonwealth Games, however, their application was rejected by the CGF, who stated that the constitutional status of Cornwall was not an issue that should be resolved through this medium. However, in 2010, the CCGA sought to launch a legal challenge to the decision of the CGF, stating that the Cornish bid of 2006 fulfilled the entire criterion of the CGF, and by rejecting the bid, the CGF had violated their own code, failing to <b>follow</b> <b>their</b> own criteria for participation. The Cornwall team will therefore seek competition in the 2014 games.|$|E

5|$|From the nationalists' {{point of}} view, the Assyrian Levies were British proxies {{to be used}} by their 'masters' to destroy the new Iraqi state whose {{independence}} the British had consistently opposed. The British allowed their Assyrian auxiliary troops to retain their arms and granted them special duty and privileges: guarding military air installations and receiving higher pay than the Iraqi Arab recruits. Under British protection, the Assyrian Levies did not become Iraqi citizens after until 1924. The nationalists believed the British were hoping for the Assyrians to destroy Iraq's internal cohesion by becoming independent and by inciting others such as the Kurds to <b>follow</b> <b>their</b> example.|$|E
5|$|In 1884 and 1885, {{through the}} {{influence}} of Archer, Shaw was engaged to write book and music criticism for London papers. When Archer resigned as art critic of The World in 1886 he secured the succession for Shaw. The two figures in the contemporary art world whose views Shaw most admired were William Morris and John Ruskin, and he sought to <b>follow</b> <b>their</b> precepts in his criticisms. Their emphasis on morality appealed to Shaw, who rejected the idea of art for art's sake, and insisted that all great art must be didactic.|$|E
5|$|In the Politburo Podgorny {{could count}} on the support of Gennady Voronov and Petro Shelest. Podgorny was {{constantly}} in conflict with Kosygin over policy issues in the Politburo. When Podgorny and Kosygin actually agreed on something Brezhnev would find himself in the minority, and forced to <b>follow</b> <b>their</b> decisions. However, Podgorny was pleased about his position within the leadership, and even more pleased by the extension of powers given to the Supreme Soviet. As head of state, Podgorny saw little threat to his position, even if a Central Committee resolution from 1971 had called {{for the expansion of}} Party activities in the Soviets.|$|E

5|$|Kidnapping is also {{a common}} theme in such folklore. Encantados {{are said to be}} fond of abducting humans with whom they fall in love, {{children}} born of their illicit love affairs, or just about anyone near the river who can keep them company, and taking them back to the Encante. The fear of this is so great among {{people who live in the}} Amazon river area that both children and adults are terrified of going near the water between dusk and dawn, or entering water-bodies alone. Some who supposedly have encountered encantados while out in their canoes have been said to have gone insane, although in fact, the creatures seem to have done little more than <b>follow</b> <b>their</b> boats and nudge them from time to time.|$|E
5|$|Songs {{from the}} Black Hole is an unfinished, {{unreleased}} album by the American alternative rock band Weezer recorded between 1994 and 1996. Intended to <b>follow</b> <b>their</b> 1994 self-titled debut album, {{it was to}} be a science fiction rock opera that expressed songwriter Rivers Cuomo's mixed feelings about rock and roll success. Its six characters were to be voiced by Cuomo, guitarist Brian Bell and bassist Matt Sharp of Weezer, Rachel Haden of That Dog and the Rentals, Joan Wasser of the Dambuilders, and Weezer collaborator Karl Koch.|$|E
5|$|The {{boys and}} Candace {{return to a}} muddy area where the T. rex has left a massive footprint, which they {{recognize}} will eventually be {{on display in the}} museum in the present. Phineas leaves a message in the footprint for Isabella and the Fireside Girls to save them. The girls—in the present—immediately spot the footprint and the message and <b>follow</b> <b>their</b> handbook to create a new time machine. They use the machine to travel back in time and rescue the three. Upon arrival in the present, though, they realize a T. rex returned with them, so Candace flees and tries to expose it to her parents. A stray ray from Doofenshmirtz's machine freezes the creature, so her parents merely believe it is an exhibit.|$|E

5|$|The chicks are fed worms, insects, and berries. Waste {{accumulation}} {{does not}} occur in the nest because adults collect and take it away. Chicks are fed, and then raise tails for elimination of waste, a solid white clump that is collected by a parent prior to flying off. All chicks in the brood leave the nest within two days of each other. Even after leaving the nest, the juveniles will <b>follow</b> <b>their</b> parents around and beg food from them. Juveniles become capable of sustained flight two weeks after fledging.|$|E
5|$|The {{extensive}} campaigning abroad by Rome, and the rewarding {{of soldiers}} with plunder from those campaigns, {{led to the}} trend of soldiers becoming increasingly loyal to their commanders {{rather than to the}} state, and a willingness to <b>follow</b> <b>their</b> generals in battle against the state. Rome was plagued by several slave uprisings during this period, in part because in the past century vast tracts of land had been given to veterans who farmed by use of slaves and who came to greatly outnumber their Roman masters. In the last century BC, at least twelve civil wars and rebellions occurred. This pattern did not break until Octavian (later Caesar Augustus) ended it by becoming a successful challenger to the Senate's authority, and was made princeps (emperor).|$|E
5|$|The {{plan called}} for the units to {{maintain}} strict radio silence and secrecy {{in order to maintain}} surprise. Maps were also only half complete, identified only enemy installations, and left out flight paths, lest the document fall into Allied hands enabling them to trace the whereabouts of German fighter bases. Most commanders were also refused permission to brief their pilots until moments before take-off. This created operational confusion. Commanders only managed to get across the bare essentials of the plan. When the operation got under way, many German pilots still did not understand what the operation was about, or what exactly was required of them. They were convinced it was just a reconnaissance in force over the front, and were happy to <b>follow</b> <b>their</b> flight leaders on this basis.|$|E

5|$|The {{point at}} which chicks fledge varies dramatically. The chicks of the Synthliboramphus murrelets, like the ancient murrelet, leave the nest the night after they hatch, {{following}} their parents out to sea, where they are raised away from terrestrial predators. Some other species, such as ducks, move their chicks away from the nest at an early age. In most species, chicks leave the nest just before, or soon after, {{they are able to}} fly. The amount of parental care after fledging varies; albatross chicks leave the nest on their own and receive no further help, while other species continue some supplementary feeding after fledging. Chicks may also <b>follow</b> <b>their</b> parents during their first migration.|$|E
5|$|The trial {{ended with}} Lhermitte {{receiving}} the maximum sentence {{for the murder}} of her five children. The court and the jury did not take any extenuating circumstances into account. In her closing argument, Lhermitte said she would accept any punishment the court gave her and showed remorse for her actions. Earlier in the trial, psychiatrists had found that Lhermitte was not of sound mind when she committed the acts and should not be held accountable for her actions. They felt that she should be admitted into a psychiatric institution rather than going to prison, but the jury did not <b>follow</b> <b>their</b> opinions. Lhermitte had been battling with depression for many years. She concluded that she saw the murder of her children and committing suicide as her only way out.|$|E
5|$|The urban {{expansion}} of Gateshead makes exact overall boundaries difficult to define. Although administratively considered one area, official documentation has split Felling into three distinct neighbourhoods: North, Central and High Felling. Felling North is roughly {{comparable to the}} old settlement at Felling Shore, bounded to the north by the River Tyne and the south by Sunderland Road. The other neighbourhoods also broadly <b>follow</b> <b>their</b> historical boundaries; the central area includes Felling town centre and the surrounding streets, while High Felling incorporates Coldwell Lane and the adjoining streets moving south towards Windy Nook.|$|E
