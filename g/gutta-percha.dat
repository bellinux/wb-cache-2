5|$|The {{crinoline}} {{needed to}} be rigid enough to support the skirts in their accustomed shape, but also flexible enough to be temporarily pressed out of shape and spring back afterwards. Other materials used for crinolines included whalebone, <b>gutta-percha</b> and vulcanised caoutchouc (natural rubber). The idea of inflatable hoops was short-lived as they were easily punctured, prone to collapse, and due {{to the use of}} brimstone in the manufacture of rubber, they smelled unpleasant. Although hard rubber hoops of <b>gutta-percha</b> worked satisfactorily at first, they were brittle and easily crushed without recovering their form. Despite objections that the sharp points of snapped steels were hazardous, lightweight steel was clearly the most successful option. It reduced the number of petticoats and their weight, and offered increased freedom of movement of the legs. However, hasty or careless movements in a hoop skirt could lead to accidentally revealing more than intended. An advertisement published in The Lady's Newspaper in 1863 for a cage crinoline with waved hoops attempted to reassure the potential customer that while wearing it, activities such as climbing stairs, passing to her theatre seat, dropping into armchairs and leaning against furniture would be possible without hindrance either to herself or to others around her.|$|E
5|$|The steel-hooped cage crinoline, first {{patented}} in April 1856 by R.C. Milliet in Paris, and {{by their}} agent in Britain a few months later, became extremely popular. Steel cage crinolines were mass-produced in huge quantity, with factories across the Western world producing tens of thousands in a year. Alternative materials, such as whalebone, cane, <b>gutta-percha</b> and even inflatable caoutchouc (natural rubber) were all used for hoops, although steel was the most popular. At its widest point, the crinoline could reach a circumference of up to six yards, although by the late 1860s, crinolines were beginning to reduce in size. By the early 1870s, the smaller crinolette and the bustle had largely replaced the crinoline.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} first {{successful}} telegraph systems were operational, the possibility of transmitting messages across the sea by way of submarine communications cables was first mooted. One of the primary technical challenges was to insulate the submarine cable sufficiently to prevent the current from leaking out into the water. In 1842, a Scottish surgeon William Montgomerie introduced <b>Gutta-percha,</b> the adhesive juice of the Palaquium gutta tree, to Europe. Michael Faraday and Wheatstone soon discovered the merits of <b>gutta-percha</b> as an insulator, and in 1845, the latter suggested {{that it should be}} employed to cover the wire which was proposed to be laid from Dover to Calais. It was tried on a wire laid across the Rhine between Deutz and Cologne. In 1849, C.V. Walker, electrician to the South Eastern Railway, submerged a two-mile wire coated with <b>gutta-percha</b> off the coast from Folkestone, which was tested successfully.|$|E
25|$|The {{hydrogen}} {{attached to}} carbon in chloroform participates in hydrogen bonding. Worldwide, chloroform {{is also used}} in pesticide formulations, as a solvent for fats, oils, rubber, alkaloids, waxes, <b>gutta-percha,</b> and resins, as a cleansing agent, grain fumigant, in fire extinguishers, and in the rubber industry. CDCl3 is a common solvent used in NMR spectroscopy.|$|E
25|$|From {{the first}} half of the twentieth century, {{physicians}} used other substances as breast implant fillers—ivory, glass balls, ground rubber, ox cartilage, Terylene wool, <b>gutta-percha,</b> Dicora, polyethylene chips, Ivalon (polyvinyl alcohol—formaldehyde polymer sponge), a polyethylene sac with Ivalon, polyether foam sponge (Etheron), polyethylene tape (Polystan) strips wound into a ball, polyester (polyurethane foam sponge) Silastic rubber, and teflon-silicone prostheses.|$|E
25|$|As {{with metal}} casting and stereotyping, a mold is first formed from the model. Since {{electrotyping}} involves wet chemical processes and is done near room temperature, the molding material can be soft. Materials such as wax, <b>gutta-percha</b> (natural latex), and ultimately ozokerite were used. The mold's surface is made electrically conducting by coating it very thinly with fine graphite powder or paint. A wire {{is attached to}} the conducting surface, and the mold is suspended in an electrolyte solution.|$|E
25|$|From 1836–7 Wheatstone {{had thought}} {{a good deal}} about {{submarine}} telegraphs, and in 1840 he gave evidence before the Railway Committee of the House of Commons on the feasibility of the proposed line from Dover to Calais. He had even designed the machinery for making and laying the cable. In the autumn of 1844, with the assistance of Mr. J. D. Llewellyn, he submerged a length of insulated wire in Swansea Bay, and signalled through it from a boat to the Mumbles Lighthouse. Next year he suggested the use of <b>gutta-percha</b> for the coating of the intended wire across the English Channel.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{limitations}} of plaster of Paris, surgeons have also experimented {{with other types of}} materials for use as splints. An early plastic like material was <b>gutta-percha</b> obtained from the latex of trees found in Malaya. It resembled rubber, but contained more resins. When dry it was hard and inelastic, but when warmed it became soft and malleable. In 1851 Utterhoeven, described the use of splints made from this material for the treatment of fractures. In the 1970s, the development of fibreglass casting tape made it possible to produce a cast that was lighter and more durable than the traditional plaster cast and also resistant to water (although the bandages underneath were not) allowing the patient to be more active.|$|E
25|$|Many {{other plants}} produce forms of latex rich in {{isoprene}} polymers, {{though not all}} produce usable forms of polymer as easily as the Pará. Some of them require more elaborate processing to produce anything like usable rubber, and most {{are more difficult to}} tap. Some produce other desirable materials, for example <b>gutta-percha</b> (Palaquium gutta) and chicle from Manilkara species. Others that have been commercially exploited, or at least showed promise as rubber sources, include the rubber fig (Ficus elastica), Panama rubber tree (Castilla elastica), various spurges (Euphorbia spp.), lettuce (Lactuca species), the related Scorzonera tau-saghyz, various Taraxacum species, including common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) and Russian dandelion (Taraxacum kok-saghyz), and perhaps most importantly for its hypoallergenic properties, guayule (Parthenium argentatum). The term gum rubber is sometimes applied to the tree-obtained version of natural rubber in order to distinguish it from the synthetic version.|$|E
500|$|Latex is {{a sticky}} {{defensive}} secretion that protects plants against herbivores. Many trees produce it when injured {{but the main}} source of the latex used to make natural rubber is the Pará rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis). Originally used to create bouncy balls and for the waterproofing of cloth, natural rubber is now mainly used in tyres for which synthetic materials have proved less durable. The latex exuded by the balatá tree (Manilkara bidentata) is used to make golf balls and is similar to <b>gutta-percha,</b> made from the latex of the [...] "getah perca" [...] tree Palaquium. This is also used as an insulator, particularly of undersea cables, and in dentistry, walking sticks and gun butts. It has now largely been replaced by synthetic materials.|$|E
500|$|Pulp {{sensitivity}} tests, usually {{carried out}} with a cotton wool [...] sprayed with ethyl chloride {{to serve as a}} cold stimulus, or with an electric pulp tester. The air spray from a three-in-one syringe may also be used to demonstrate areas of dentin hypersensitivity. Heat tests can also be applied with hot <b>Gutta-percha.</b> [...] A healthy tooth will feel the cold but the pain will be mild and disappear once the stimulus is removed. [...] The accuracy of these tests has been reported as 86% for cold testing, 81% for electric pulp testing, and 71% for heat testing. [...] Because of the lack of test sensitivity, a second symptom should be present or a positive test before making a diagnosis.|$|E
500|$|In the {{interests}} of public safety, the Minister can make a [...] "clearance order" [...] concerning land that is within [...] of any railway, public road or perimeter fence within a security area, or land in a security area that is [...] "used for or {{in connection with the}} cultivation of rubber, oil palm, <b>gutta-percha,</b> coconut, bananas or any other fruit growing on trees, or any other agricultural or food crops". Such an order directs the owner or occupier of the land, their agent, or any person living in the area surrounded by a perimeter fence to clear away [...] "all herbage, bush and undergrowth and any other object mentioned in the order, other than permanent buildings", prevent the undergrowth from growing higher than , and maintain the cleanliness of the land. Failure to comply with a clearance order is a criminal offence.|$|E
500|$|Willis defended Catharine, who {{maintained}} her innocence, in the Home Journal {{and suggested}} that Forrest was merely jealous of her intellectual superiority. On June 17, 1850, shortly after Forrest had filed for divorce in the New York Supreme Court, Forrest beat Willis with a <b>gutta-percha</b> whip in New York's Washington Square, shouting [...] "this man is the seducer of my wife". Willis, who was recovering from a rheumatic fever at the time, was unable to fight back. His wife soon received an anonymous letter with an accusation that Willis was in an adulterous relationship with Catherine Forrest. Willis later sued Forrest for assault and, by March 1852, was awarded $2,500 plus court costs. Throughout the Forrest divorce case, which lasted six weeks, several witnesses made additional claims that Catherine Forrest and Nathaniel Parker Willis were having an affair, including a waiter who claimed {{he had seen the}} couple [...] "lying on each other". As the press reported, [...] "thousands and thousands of the anxious public" [...] awaited the court's verdict; ultimately, the court sided with Catherine Forrest and Willis's name was cleared.|$|E
2500|$|Latex is {{the polymer}} cis-1,4-polyisoprene – with a {{molecular}} weight of 100,000 to 1,000,000 daltons. Typically, {{a small percentage}} (up to 5% of dry mass) of other materials, such as proteins, fatty acids, resins, and inorganic materials (salts) are found in natural rubber. Polyisoprene can also be created synthetically, producing what is {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "synthetic natural rubber", but the synthetic and natural routes are different. Some natural rubber sources, such as <b>gutta-percha,</b> are composed of trans-1,4-polyisoprene, a structural isomer that has similar properties.|$|E
2500|$|As Ariel Roguin {{describes}} in his paper [...] "Stent: The Man and Word Behind the Coronary Metal Prosthesis", the current acceptable {{origin of the}} word stent is that it derives from {{the name of a}} dentist. Charles Thomas Stent, notable for his advances in the field of denture-making. He was born in Brighton, England, on October 17, 1807. He was a dentist in London and is most famous for improving and modifying the denture base of the <b>gutta-percha,</b> creating the Stent's compounding that made it practical as a material for dental impressions.|$|E
2500|$|Continental AG, {{commonly}} known as Continental, is a leading German automotive manufacturing company specialising in tyres, brake systems, interior electronics, automotive safety, powertrain and chassis components, tachographs, and other parts for the automotive and transportation industries. Continental is based in Hanover, Lower Saxony, Germany. Continental is the world's fourth-largest tyre manufacturer. Continental was founded in 1871 as a rubber manufacturer, Continental-Caoutchouc und <b>Gutta-Percha</b> Compagnie.

2500|$|Randolph B. Marcy, an Army {{officer who}} wrote a 1859 guide, advised taking less bacon than the earlier guides had recommended. [...] He advised emigrants to drive cattle instead {{as a source of}} fresh beef. Marcy also {{instructed}} emigrants to store sides of bacon in canvas bags or in boxes surrounded by bran to protect against extreme heat, which could make bacon go rancid. Marcy instructed emigrants to put salt pork on the bottom of wagons to avoid exposure to extreme heat. Marcy also recommended the use of pemmican, as well as the storage of sugar in India-rubber or <b>gutta-percha</b> sacks, to prevent it from becoming wet.|$|E
2500|$|O'Shaughnessy's {{experimental}} set-up of 1851–52 consisted of both overhead and underground lines; the latter included underwater ones that crossed two rivers, the Hooghly and the Haldi. [...] The overhead line was constructed by welding uninsulated iron rods, 13½ {{feet long and}} 3/8inch wide, end to end. [...] These lines, which weighed 1,250 pounds per mile, were held aloft by fifteen-foot lengths of bamboo, planted into the ground at equal intervals—200 to the mile—and covered with a layer each of coal tar and pitch for insulation. [...] The underwater cables had been manufactured in England and consisted of copper wire covered with <b>gutta-percha.</b> [...] Furthermore, {{in order to protect}} the cables from dragging ship anchors, the cables were attached to the links of a [...] chain cable. An underwater cable of length 2,070 yards was laid across the Hooghly river at Diamond Harbour, and another, 1,400 yards long, was laid across the Haldi at Kedgeree.|$|E
2500|$|Travis was not {{hesitant}} {{about trying}} new equipment {{in his efforts}} to improve his game. [...] He was the first to win a major event using the Haskell rubber-cored golf ball—the 1901 U.S. Amateur. [...] As reported in the Travis biography, [...] "The Old Man", Travis had [...] "dabbled with predecessors of the Haskell ball, but kept his involvement under wraps until shortly before the tournament" [...] and he [...] "had developed a feel for this type of ball with practice and was not afraid to debut it at the championship". [...] As Labbance reports, [...] "Travis's bold move had not only prompted a change in golf balls but a change in golf as well". [...] It sounded the death knell for the <b>gutta-percha</b> ball, created the need for inserts in the face of wooden clubs to prevent splitting, and soon led to calls for the lengthening of golf courses due to the longer shots made possible by the Haskell.|$|E
2500|$|Two days later, on the {{afternoon}} of May 22, Brooks confronted Sumner as he sat writing at his desk in the almost empty Senate chamber: [...] "Mr. Sumner, I have read your speech twice over carefully. [...] It is a libel on South Carolina, and Mr. Butler, who is a relative of mine." [...] As Sumner began to stand up, Brooks beat Sumner severely on the head before he could reach his feet, using a thick <b>gutta-percha</b> cane with a gold head. Sumner was knocked down and trapped under the heavy desk, which was bolted to the floor, but Brooks continued to strike Sumner until Sumner ripped the desk from the floor. [...] By this time, Sumner was blinded by his own blood, and he staggered up the aisle and collapsed, lapsing into unconsciousness. Brooks beat the motionless Sumner until his cane broke, at which point he continued to strike Sumner with the remaining piece. Several other Senators attempted to help Sumner, but were blocked by Keitt who brandished a pistol and shouted, [...] "Let them be!" ...|$|E
60|$|Siphons.--A {{flexible}} tube of some kind, whether of india-rubber, <b>gutta-percha,</b> or, still better, of macintosh, strained over rings, {{would be very}} valuable as a siphon: both for filling large kegs out of buckets and for emptying them again. Vulcanised india-rubber becomes rotten after short use, and <b>gutta-percha</b> will stand no extremes of temperature.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the process}} of construction, the central wire of the copper core was first covered with a {{semi-liquid}} coating of <b>gutta-percha,</b> mixed with tar--known as [...] "Chatterton's Compound." [...] This was laid on so thick that when the other wires were wound round it all air was excluded. Then a coating of the same compound was laid over the finished conductor, and thus the core was solidified. Next, the core was surrounded with a coating of the purest gutta-percha--a splendid non-conductor, impervious to water--which, when pressed to it, while in a plastic state, formed the first insulator or tube to the core. Over this tube was laid a thin coat of Chatterton's Compound {{for the purpose of}} closing up any small flaws or minute holes that might have escaped detection. Then came a second coating of <b>gutta-percha,</b> followed by another coating of compound, and so on alternately until four coats of compound and four of <b>gutta-percha</b> had been laid on.|$|E
