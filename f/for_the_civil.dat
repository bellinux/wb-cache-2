Under the threefold classification of the broad grounds of judicial review set out in Council of Civil Service Unions v.

The first attempt to march on March 7, 1965, was aborted because of mob and police violence against the demonstrators. This day {{has become known as}} Bloody Sunday and was a major turning point in the effort to gain public support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> Rights Movement. It was the clearest demonstration up to that time of the dramatic potential of King's nonviolence strategy. King, however, was not present.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{no records}} survive of the Norman {{market in the}} 11th to 13thcenturies. It is known that shortly after the market's establishment, a tollhouse was built nearby, which served as a {{collection}} point for taxes on trade. Although the precise location of the tollhouse is not recorded, it was immediately north of the market on part of the site now occupied by the Guildhall. At some point soon after its construction, the tollhouse also became the centre <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> administration of the city. Although the Tombland market retained its charter to host an annual horse fair, over time the market at Mancroft supplanted that at Tombland as the principal market of the area. At {{the end of the}} 11thcentury, the Tombland market was removed during construction work on Norwich Cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Although {{sections}} 8 and 10 of the ISA concern {{matters of}} national security, the Court held that this concern {{does not preclude}} the objective review of executive discretion. Following the case of Council of Civil Service Unions v.

Similarly, it should also be within the court's purview to determine whether the matters relied upon in exercising powers under the ISA fall within the scope of purposes specified by sections8 and 10.|$|E

Like all modern Prime Ministers, Brown {{concurrently}} served as the First Lord of the Treasury and the Minister <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> Service, {{and was a member}} of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom. Until his resignation from the post in May 2010 he was Leader of the Labour Party. He was Member of Parliament for the constituency of Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath until he stepped down in 2015. He was the sixth post-war Prime Minister, of a total of 13, to assume the role without having won a general election.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Cooper was loaned out to MGM <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War drama film Operator 13 with Marion Davies, about a {{beautiful}} Union spy who {{falls in love}} with a Confederate soldier. Despite Richard Boleslawski's imaginative direction and George J. Folsey's lavish cinematography, the film did poorly at the box office. Back at Paramount, Cooper appeared in his first of seven films by director Henry Hathaway, Now and Forever, with Carole Lombard and Shirley Temple. In the film, he plays a confidence man who tries to sell his daughter to the relatives who raised her, but is eventually won over by the adorable girl. Impressed by Temple's intelligence and charm, Cooper developed a close rapport with her, both on and off screen. The film was a box-office success.|$|E
5|$|Indiana was {{the first}} of the country's western states to {{mobilize}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War. When news reached Indiana of the attack on Fort Sumter, South Carolina, on April 12, 1861, many Indiana residents were surprised, but their response was immediate. On the following day, two mass meetings were held in Indianapolis, the state capital of Indiana, and the state's position was decided: Indiana would remain in the Union and would immediately contribute men to suppress the rebellion. On April 15, Indiana's governor, Oliver P. Morton, issued a call for volunteer soldiers to meet the state's quota set by President Abraham Lincoln.|$|E

5|$|Milner-Barry {{joined the}} Treasury in 1945 with the grade of Principal. In 1947, he married Thelma Tennant Wells, {{with whom he}} had a son and two daughters. The same year, he was {{promoted}} to Assistant Secretary, and Under-secretary in 1954. Apart from a stint in the Ministry of Health from 1958–60, he remained with the Treasury until 1966, when, aged 60, he had reached the normal retirement age <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> service. He was persuaded instead to carry on as a ceremonial officer administering the honours system. In this role, he supported the knighthoods of P. G. Wodehouse and Noël Coward. Milner-Barry eventually retired in 1977. He was appointed OBE in 1946 for his work in World War II, CB in 1962, and KCVO in 1975.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeal {{held that}} the scope of review of the {{discretion}} conferred by sections 8 and 10 of the ISA {{is limited to the}} traditional administrative law grounds of illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety as established in the House of Lords decision Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> Service (1984), also known as the GCHQ case. The Court noted that the scope of judicial review depends on whether a jurisdictional or precedent fact is involved. Where no jurisdictional fact is involved, the scope of review is limited to the GCHQ grounds. Where a jurisdictional fact issue arises, the scope of review extends to deciding whether the precedent fact has been established. Whether a particular discretionary power is subject to any jurisdictional fact depends on the construction of the legislation which creates that power.|$|E
5|$|There {{are fewer}} records of {{elephants}} {{being used as}} straightforward executioners <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> population. One such example is mentioned by Josephus and the deuterocanonical book of 3 Maccabees {{in connection with the}} Egyptian Jews, though the story is likely apocryphal. 3 Maccabees describes an attempt by Ptolemy IV Philopator (ruled 221–204 BC) to enslave and brand Egypt's Jews with the symbol of Dionysus. When the majority of the Jews resisted, the king is said to have rounded them up and ordered them to be trampled on by elephants. The mass execution was ultimately thwarted, supposedly by the intervention of angels, following which Ptolemy took an altogether more forgiving attitude towards his Jewish subjects.|$|E
