If energy, range and hardware capabilities are different in various nodes in the network than these types of network are mainly known as heterogeneous network.

Only concise information should be delivered to the sink nodes to reduce communications energy which help to increase the effective network lifetime with optimal data <b>delivery</b> <b>to</b> base <b>station</b> and end user. An inefficient use of the available energy of nodes leads to unreliable performance and short life cycle of the sensor network.

A key aspect {{of this study is}} the modeling of a fair-access criterion that requires sensors to have an equal rate of underwater frame <b>delivery</b> <b>to</b> the base <b>station.</b> Tight upper bounds on network utilization and tight lower bounds on the minimum time between samples are derived for fixed linear and grid topologies. The significance of these bounds is two-fold: First, they hold for any MAC protocol under both single-channel and half-duplex radios; second, they are provably tight. For underwater sensor networks, under certain conditions, we derive a tight upper bound on network utilization and demonstrate a significant fact that the utilization in networks with propagation delay is larger than that in networks with no propagation delay.

40|$|International audienceThe most {{protocols}} {{designed for}} {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs) {{have been developed for}} an ideal environment represented by unit disc graph model (UDG) in which the data is considered as successfully received if the communicating nodes are within the transmission range of each other. However, these protocols do {{not take into account the}} fluctuations of radio signal that can happen in realistic environment. This paper aims to adapt LEACH protocol for realistic environment since LEACH is considered as the best cluster-based routing protocol in terms of energy consumption for WSNs. We have carried out an evaluation of LEACH based on two models; lognormal shadowing model (LNS) in which the probability of reception without error is calculated according to the Euclidian distance separating the communicating nodes and probabilistic model in which the probability of reception is generated randomly. In both models, if the probability of successful reception is lower than a predefined threshold, a multi-hop communication is incorporated for forwarding data between cluster-heads (CHs) towards the base station instead of direct communication as in original version of LEACH. The main aims of this contribution are minimizing energy consumption and guaranteeing reliable data <b>delivery</b> <b>to</b> the base <b>station.</b> The simulation results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the original LEACH for both models in terms of energy consumption and ratio of successful received packets...|$|R
