5|$|<b>Dendritic</b> cells (DC) are phagocytes in tissues {{that are}} {{in contact with the}} {{external}} environment; therefore, they are located mainly in the skin, nose, lungs, stomach, and intestines. They are named for their resemblance to neuronal dendrites, as both have many spine-like projections, but <b>dendritic</b> cells are in no way connected to the nervous system. <b>Dendritic</b> cells serve as a link between the bodily tissues and the innate and adaptive immune systems, as they present antigens to T cells, one of the key cell types of the adaptive immune system.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dendritic</b> {{cells are}} {{specialized}} antigen-presenting cells {{that have long}} outgrowths called dendrites, that help to engulf microbes and other invaders. <b>Dendritic</b> cells {{are present in the}} tissues that are in contact with the external environment, mainly the skin, the inner lining of the nose, the lungs, the stomach, and the intestines. Once activated, they mature and migrate to the lymphoid tissues where they interact with T cells and B cells to initiate and orchestrate the adaptive immune response.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dendritic</b> cells {{bridge the}} {{innate immune system}} and {{adaptive}} immune system. They are increased in psoriatic lesions and induce the proliferation of T cells and type 1 helper T cells (Th1). Targeted immunotherapy as well as psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy can {{reduce the number of}} <b>dendritic</b> cells and favors a Th2 cell cytokine secretion pattern over a Th1/Th17 cell cytokine profile. Psoriatic T cells move from the dermis into the epidermis and secrete interferon-γ and interleukin-17. Interleukin-23 is known to induce the production of interleukin-17 and interleukin-22. Interleukin-22 works in combination with interleukin-17 to induce keratinocytes to secrete neutrophil-attracting cytokines.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{the cause}} of the {{spectrum}} of disease known as HIV/AIDS. HIV is a retrovirus that primarily infects components of the human immune system such as CD4+ T cells, macrophages and <b>dendritic</b> cells. It directly and indirectly destroys CD4+ T cells.|$|E
5|$|Melanocytic nevi and {{neoplasms}} {{are caused}} by either a proliferation of (1) melanocytes, or (2) nevus cells, a form of melanocyte that lack <b>dendritic</b> processes.|$|E
5|$|Once {{inside the}} skin, dengue virus binds to Langerhans cells (a {{population}} of <b>dendritic</b> {{cells in the}} skin that identifies pathogens). The virus enters the cells through binding between viral proteins and membrane proteins on the Langerhans cell, specifically the C-type lectins called DC-SIGN, mannose receptor and CLEC5A. DC-SIGN, a non-specific receptor for foreign material on <b>dendritic</b> cells, {{seems to be the}} main point of entry. The <b>dendritic</b> cell moves to the nearest lymph node. Meanwhile, the virus genome is translated in membrane-bound vesicles on the cell's endoplasmic reticulum, where the cell's protein synthesis apparatus produces new viral proteins that replicate the viral RNA and begin to form viral particles. Immature virus particles are transported to the Golgi apparatus, the part of the cell where some of the proteins receive necessary sugar chains (glycoproteins). The now mature new viruses are released by exocytosis. They are then able to enter other white blood cells, such as monocytes and macrophages.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebellar}} cortex {{is divided into}} three layers. At the bottom lies the thick granular layer, densely packed with granule cells, along with interneurons, mainly Golgi cells but also including Lugaro cells and unipolar brush cells. In the middle lies the Purkinje layer, a narrow zone that contains the cell bodies of Purkinje cells and Bergmann glial cells. At the top lies the molecular layer, which contains the flattened <b>dendritic</b> trees of Purkinje cells, along with the huge array of parallel fibers penetrating the Purkinje cell <b>dendritic</b> trees at right angles. This outermost layer of the {{cerebellar cortex}} also contains two types of inhibitory interneuron: stellate cells and basket cells. Both stellate and basket cells form GABAergic synapses onto Purkinje cell dendrites.|$|E
5|$|The {{long-term}} {{stabilization of}} synaptic changes is also {{determined by a}} parallel increase of pre- and postsynaptic structures such as axonal bouton, <b>dendritic</b> spine and postsynaptic density.|$|E
5|$|HIV can infect <b>dendritic</b> cells (DCs) by this CD4-CCR5 route, {{but another}} route using mannose-specific C-type lectin receptors such as DC-SIGN {{can also be}} used. DCs {{are one of the}} first cells {{encountered}} by the virus during sexual transmission. They are currently thought {{to play an important role}} by transmitting HIV to T-cells when the virus is captured in the mucosa by DCs. The presence of FEZ-1, which occurs naturally in neurons, is believed to prevent the infection of cells by HIV.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the signaling pathways described above, hippocampal LTP may be altered {{by a variety of}} modulators. For example, the steroid hormone estradiol may enhance LTP by driving CREB phosphorylation and subsequent <b>dendritic</b> spine growth. Additionally, β-adrenergic receptor agonists such as norepinephrine may alter the protein synthesis-dependent late phase of LTP. Nitric oxide synthase activity may also result in the subsequent activation of guanylyl cyclase and PKG. Similarly, activation of dopamine receptors may enhance LTP through the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway.|$|E
5|$|Leukocytes (white blood cells) {{act like}} independent, {{single-celled}} organisms {{and are the}} second arm of the innate immune system. The innate leukocytes include the phagocytes (macrophages, neutrophils, and <b>dendritic</b> cells), innate lymphoid cells, mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, and natural killer cells. These cells identify and eliminate pathogens, either by attacking larger pathogens through contact or by engulfing and then killing microorganisms. Innate cells are also important mediators in lymphoid organ development and the activation of the adaptive immune system.|$|E
5|$|Sex-specific {{responses}} to stress {{have also been}} demonstrated in the rat, {{to have an effect}} on the hippocampus. Chronic stress in the male rat showed <b>dendritic</b> retraction and cell loss in the CA3 region but this was not shown in the female. This was thought to be due to neuroprotective ovarian hormones.|$|E
5|$|Snow {{develops}} in clouds that themselves {{are part of}} a larger weather system. The physics of snow crystal development in clouds results from a complex set of variables that include moisture content and temperatures. The resulting shapes of the falling and fallen crystals can be classified into a number of basic shapes and combinations, thereof. Occasionally, some plate-like, <b>dendritic</b> and stellar-shaped snowflakes can form under clear sky with a very cold temperature inversion present.|$|E
5|$|The {{watershed}} of Abrahams Creek {{is continuing}} to become more developed, but at a slower rate than {{it has in the}} past. The lower reaches of the watershed are the most heavily urbanized, while the upper reaches are still largely rural. This has been the case as early 1893. The upper reaches of the watershed have a <b>dendritic</b> drainage system.|$|E
5|$|Virotherapy {{involves}} the use of genetically modified viruses to treat diseases. Viruses have been modified by scientists to reproduce in cancer cells and destroy them but not infect healthy cells. Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC), for example, is a modified herpes simplex virus that has had a gene, which is required for viruses to replicate in healthy cells, deleted and replaced with a human gene (GM-CSF) that stimulates immunity. When this virus infects cancer cells, it destroys them and in doing so the presence the GM-CSF gene attracts <b>dendritic</b> cells from the surrounding tissues of the body. The <b>dendritic</b> cells process the dead cancer cells and present components of them to other cells of the immune system. Having completed successful clinical trials, this virus is expected to gain approval for the treatment of a skin cancer called melanoma in late 2015. Viruses that have been reprogrammed to kill cancer cells are called oncolytic viruses.|$|E
5|$|Cerebellar granule cells, in {{contrast}} to Purkinje cells, are among the smallest neurons in the brain. They are also easily the most numerous neurons in the brain: In humans, estimates of their total number average around 50 billion, which means that about 3/4 of the brain's neurons are cerebellar granule cells. Their cell bodies are packed into a thick layer {{at the bottom of}} the cerebellar cortex. A granule cell emits only four to five dendrites, each of which ends in an enlargement called a <b>dendritic</b> claw. These enlargements are sites of excitatory input from mossy fibers and inhibitory input from Golgi cells.|$|E
5|$|HIV infects vital {{cells in}} the human immune system such as helper T cells (specifically CD4+ T cells), macrophages, and <b>dendritic</b> cells. HIV {{infection}} leads to low levels of CD4+ T cells {{through a number of}} mechanisms, including pyroptosis of abortively infected T cells, apoptosis of uninfected bystander cells, direct viral killing of infected cells, and killing of infected CD4+ T cells by CD8 cytotoxic lymphocytes that recognize infected cells. When CD4+ T cell numbers decline below a critical level, cell-mediated immunity is lost, and the body becomes progressively more susceptible to opportunistic infections.|$|E
5|$|Larrys Creek is in {{a narrow}} valley formed by {{mountains}} and hills, with steep to moderate slopes. The channel pattern is regular, with a <b>dendritic</b> drainage pattern. South of its source, the creek turns to flow southwest along {{the northern edge of}} Green Mountain, turns south into the State Game Lands at Buckhorn Mountain, and flows south along the western edge of Coal Mountain. The only named peak on the west bank of Larrys Creek itself is Harris Point, where it leaves the dissected Allegheny Plateau.|$|E
5|$|Purkinje {{cells are}} among the most {{distinctive}} neurons in the brain, and one of the earliest types to be recognized—they were first described by the Czech anatomist Jan Evangelista Purkyně in 1837. They are distinguished by the shape of their <b>dendritic</b> tree: The dendrites branch very profusely, but are severely flattened in a plane perpendicular to the cerebellar folds. Thus, the dendrites of a Purkinje cell form a dense planar net, through which parallel fibers pass at right angles. The dendrites are covered with <b>dendritic</b> spines, each of which receives synaptic input from a parallel fiber. Purkinje cells receive more synaptic inputs than any other type of cell in the brain—estimates of the number of spines on a single human Purkinje cell run as high as 200,000. The large, spherical cell bodies of Purkinje cells are packed into a narrow layer (one cell thick) of the cerebellar cortex, called the Purkinje layer. After emitting collaterals that affect nearby parts of the cortex, their axons travel into the deep cerebellar nuclei, where they make on the order of 1,000 contacts each with several types of nuclear cells, all within a small domain. Purkinje cells use GABA as their neurotransmitter, and therefore exert inhibitory effects on their targets.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dendritic</b> cell {{apoptosis}} – {{immune system}} cells called <b>dendritic</b> cells present antigens to active lymphocytes. <b>Dendritic</b> {{cells that are}} defective in apoptosis can lead to inappropriate systemic lymphocyte activation and consequent decline in self-tolerance.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dendritic</b> cell therapies {{include the}} use of {{antibodies}} that bind to receptors on the surface of <b>dendritic</b> cells. Antigens can be added to the antibody and can induce the <b>dendritic</b> cells to mature and provide immunity to the tumor. <b>Dendritic</b> cell receptors such as TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 or CD40 have been used as antibody targets.|$|E
25|$|All eczemas are {{characterized}} by spongiosis which allows inflammatory mediators to accumulate. Different <b>dendritic</b> cells subtypes, such as Langerhans cells, inflammatory <b>dendritic</b> epidermal cells and plasmacytoid <b>dendritic</b> cells {{have a role to}} play.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dendritic</b> {{cell therapy}} provokes anti-tumor {{responses}} by causing <b>dendritic</b> cells to present tumor antigens to lymphocytes, which activates them, priming them to kill other cells that present the antigen. <b>Dendritic</b> cells are {{components of the}} immune system called antigen presenting cells (APCs). In cancer treatment they aid cancer antigen targeting. The only approved cellular cancer therapy based on <b>dendritic</b> cells is sipuleucel-T.|$|E
25|$|A <b>dendritic</b> spike is {{initiated}} {{in the same}} manner as that of an axonal action potential. Depolarization of the <b>dendritic</b> membrane causes sodium and potassium voltage-gated ion channels to open. The influx of sodium ions causes an increase in voltage. If the voltage increases past a certain threshold, the sodium current activates other voltage-gated sodium channels transmitting a current along the dendrite. <b>Dendritic</b> spikes can be generated through both sodium and calcium voltage-gated channels. <b>Dendritic</b> spikes usually transmit signals at a much slower rate than axonal action potentials. Local voltage thresholds for <b>dendritic</b> spike initiation are usually higher than that of action potential initiation in the axon; therefore, spike initiation usually requires a strong input.|$|E
25|$|Initiation of a <b>dendritic</b> spike {{through a}} single strong {{synaptic}} input {{does not guarantee}} that the spike will propagate reliably over long distances. If multiple synapses are simultaneously activated, <b>dendritic</b> spikes may be formed through spatial summation. Spatial summation involves the addition of multiple input signals resulting in a larger signal and possibly a <b>dendritic</b> spike. Hippocampal CA1 neurons {{have been shown to}} produce reliable <b>dendritic</b> spike propagation through spatial summation of multiple synaptic inputs. In the hippocampus, the CA1 neurons contain two distinctive regions that receive excitatory synaptic inputs: the perforant path (PP) through the apical <b>dendritic</b> tuft (500-750 μm from soma) and the Schaffer-collateral (SC) through the basal and apical dendrites (250-500 μm from soma). Studies show that individual stimulation of either the PP or SC was not sufficient enough to allow a <b>dendritic</b> spike to initiate an action potential. However, it was shown that when a <b>dendritic</b> spike occurred due to PP stimulations, the presence of a SC stimulation determined whether or not the signal would propagate to the soma.|$|E
25|$|The {{transient}} A-type voltage-gated {{potassium channel}} {{is a specific}} channel that {{plays a key role}} in <b>dendritic</b> spike initiation. The density of voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels is similar in both dendrites and axons; however, the <b>dendritic</b> membrane is far less excitable than the axonal membrane. The difference in excitability can be attributed to the presence of these voltage-gated potassium channels. Voltage-gated potassium channels inhibit the ability of dendrites to generate action potentials and decrease the amplitude of <b>dendritic</b> spikes with increasing distance from the soma. The ability of voltage-gated potassium channels to modulate <b>dendritic</b> signaling may have significant effects on synaptic plasticity.|$|E
25|$|The {{dendrites}} of a neuron are cellular extensions {{with many}} branches. This overall shape and structure {{is referred to}} metaphorically as a <b>dendritic</b> tree. This is {{where the majority of}} input to the neuron occurs via the <b>dendritic</b> spine.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to controlling {{the efficacy of}} GABAergic synapses through chloride homeostasis, KCC2 {{play a critical role}} in the morphogenesis and function of glutamatergic synapses within the central nervous system. Studies on hippocampal tissue in KCC2 knockout animals showed that neurons lacking KCC2 have stunted <b>dendritic</b> growth and malformed <b>dendritic</b> spines. Recent studies demonstrate that KCC2 plays a critical role in the structure and function of <b>dendritic</b> spines which host most excitatory synapses in cortical neurons. Through an interaction with actin cytoskeleton, KCC2 forms a molecular barrier to the diffusion of transmembrane proteins within <b>dendritic</b> spines, thereby regulating the local confinment of AMPA receptors and synaptic potency.|$|E
25|$|Proteins in the PSD are {{involved}} in anchoring and trafficking neurotransmitter receptors and modulating the activity of these receptors. The receptors and PSDs are often found in specialized protrusions from the main <b>dendritic</b> shaft called <b>dendritic</b> spines.|$|E
25|$|Distribution of {{voltage-gated}} sodium channels {{along the}} <b>dendritic</b> membrane plays {{a crucial role}} in a dendrites ability to propagate a signal. High <b>dendritic</b> membrane thresholds often make it harder for initiation of <b>dendritic</b> spikes. However, increased density of voltage-gated sodium channels may reduce the amplitude of a signal needed to initiate a spike. Clustering of voltage-gated sodium channels have been observed at the synapses of the globus pallidus neuron. It has also been demonstrated through <b>dendritic</b> computational models that the threshold amplitude of a synaptic conductance needed to generate a <b>dendritic</b> spike is significantly less if the voltage-gated sodium channels are clustered at the synapse. The same type of voltage-gated channels may differ in distribution between the soma and dendrite within the same neuron. There seems to be no general pattern of distribution for voltage-gated channels within dendrites. Different neuronal dendrites exhibit different density patterns which are subject to change during development and can be modulated by neurotransmitters.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{vaccination}} generates {{an effective}} immune memory via {{the display of}} antigen-antibody complexes on follicular <b>dendritic</b> cells (FDC), which are potent B-cell stimulators. T-cells can be stimulated by similar, germinal centre <b>dendritic</b> cells. FDC are able to generate an immune memory because antibodies production “overlaps” long-term expression of antigen, allowing antigen-antibody immunocomplexes to form and be displayed by FDC.|$|E
25|$|The {{dependence}} of post-synaptic depolarization in STDP indicates {{the importance of}} <b>dendritic</b> spikes. In general, post-synaptic depolarization occurs coincidentally with pre-synaptic activity when a backwards propagating signal reaches the post-synaptic membrane. <b>Dendritic</b> spikes allow backward propagating signals to reach and depolarize the post-synaptic membrane. The strengthening and weakening of synaptic connections is one proposed method of memory formation and learning.|$|E
25|$|Another {{strategy}} is to remove <b>dendritic</b> cells from the blood of a patient and activate them outside the body. The <b>dendritic</b> cells are activated {{in the presence of}} tumor antigens, which may be a single tumor-specific peptide/protein or a tumor cell lysate (a solution of broken down tumor cells). These cells (with optional adjuvants) are infused and provoke an immune response.|$|E
25|$|Voltage-gated {{potassium}} {{channels are}} {{another set of}} voltage-gated channels that {{play a significant role}} in the initiation of <b>dendritic</b> spikes. Voltage-gated potassium channels, similar to voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels, facilitate the movement of cations across the plasma membrane. But unlike voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels, the voltage-gated potassium channel moves cations out of the cell thereby having an inhibitory effect on <b>dendritic</b> spike initiation.|$|E
25|$|In the substantia nigra, DAT is {{localized}} to axonal and <b>dendritic</b> (i.e., pre- and post-synaptic) plasma membranes.|$|E
25|$|Spine {{plasticity}} is {{implicated in}} motivation, learning, and memory. In particular, long-term memory is mediated {{in part by}} the growth of new <b>dendritic</b> spines (or the enlargement of pre-existing spines) to reinforce a particular neural pathway. Because <b>dendritic</b> spines are plastic structures whose lifespan is influenced by input activity, spine dynamics may {{play an important role in}} the maintenance of memory over a lifetime.|$|E
