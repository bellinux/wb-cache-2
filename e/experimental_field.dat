5|$|Astronomy {{classes at}} the University of Illinois date to its {{earliest}} days. The first courses focused on measurement {{of the night sky}} and was taken by civil engineering students to sharpen their surveying skills. A small observatory consisting of a 4-inch refractor and a small transit telescope was constructed by 1872. The astronomy courses were typically taught by the mathematics department and by the early 1890s, several mathematics instructors wanted to do more with astronomy. An expanded astronomy curriculum would require a new larger facility. The Illinois state legislature voted in 1895 to fund a new teaching observatory at the University of Illinois, providing $15,000 for construction. The site chosen was a grass knoll between Matthews Avenue and Burrill Avenue, just north of the Morrow Plots, a National Historic Landmark that is the nation's oldest <b>experimental</b> <b>field.</b> Contracts were extended to Charles A. Gunn, the architect and an instructor on campus, and Bevis and Company in Urbana as the general contractor with construction beginning in April 1896. The building was completed by August at a total cost of $6,800. The principle telescope was installed in November and the final telescope was in place by February 1897.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the project}} was to monitor the {{influence}} of cultivation on the quality of surface- and grundwater within selected agricultural areas. The project consisted of sixteen <b>experimental</b> <b>fields</b> with measuring devices for regular sampling of drainage water and continous registration of discharge. The <b>experimental</b> <b>fields</b> were included in the farmers normal management and covered various soil types, cropping and ferlilizer regimes. Information concerninge cultivation practices were collected regularly. The size of the fields varied between 4 and 34 ha. Grundwater samples were taken and grondwater pressure measured in eleven fields. Groundwater pressure was meassured once a month and samples were taken every other month. Samples of drainage water were taken every other week, or in some cases every week during periods of large discharge. During the year´of review 1991 - 92 there was a large variation in nitrogen losses from 1 to 130 kg Tot-N/ha. Twelve of the <b>experimental</b> <b>fields</b> had smaller nitrogen losses compared to average losses during the period 1977 / 91 (table 1). Mostly this was due to lower nitrogen concentration (table 2 and 3). Also this year most of the fields with lower nitrogen concentrations were cropped during the winter. Phosphorus losses variated from 0, 01 to 1, 24 kg Tot-P/ha (table 1) and two of the <b>experimental</b> <b>fields</b> had larger losses compared to their long term average. In one of the <b>experimental</b> <b>fields</b> there was a decrease in nitrogen concentration in groundwater. In the remaining fields, the nitrate concentration in groundwater had changed negligible. One of the best fields had nitrate concentrations in groundwater above the headlimit for drinkin water...|$|R
25|$|The {{increased}} CO2 levels deactivated three genes {{within the}} soybean plant that normally create chemical defenses against pest insects. One of these defenses is a protein that blocks digestion of the soy leaves in insects. Since this gene was deactivated, the beetles {{were able to}} digest a much higher amount of plant matter than the beetles in the control field. This led to the observed longer lifespans and higher egg-laying rates in the <b>experimental</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other natural historians, such as Buffon, {{accepted}} adaptation, {{and some}} also accepted evolution, without voicing their opinions {{as to the}} mechanism. This illustrates the real merit of Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, and secondary figures such as Henry Walter Bates, for putting forward a mechanism whose significance had only been glimpsed previously. A century later, <b>experimental</b> <b>field</b> studies and breeding experiments by people such as E. B. Ford and Dobzhansky produced evidence that natural selection {{was not only the}} 'engine' behind adaptation, but was a much stronger force than had previously been thought.|$|E
25|$|Oppenheimer had {{predicted}} that the field-induced tunneling of electrons from atoms (the effect now called field ionization) would have this i(V) dependence, had found this dependence in the published <b>experimental</b> <b>field</b> emission results of Millikan and Eyring, and proposed that CFE was due to field-induced tunneling of electrons from atomic-like orbitals in surface metal atoms. An alternative Fowler–Nordheim theory explained both the Millikan-Lauritsen finding and the very weak dependence of current on temperature. Fowler–Nordheim theory predicted both to be consequences if CFE were due to field-induced tunneling from free-electron-type states in what we would now call a metal conduction band, with the electron states occupied in accordance with Fermi–Dirac statistics.|$|E

25|$|Neuropsychology is {{the study}} of the {{structure}} and function of the brain as they relate to specific psychological processes and behaviours. It is an <b>experimental</b> <b>field</b> of psychology that aims to understand how behavior and cognition are influenced by brain functioning and is concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of behavioral and cognitive effects of neurological disorders. Whereas classical neurology focuses on the physiology of the nervous system and classical psychology is largely divorced from it, neuropsychology seeks to discover how the brain correlates with the mind. It thus shares concepts and concerns with neuropsychiatry and with behavioral neurology in general. The term neuropsychology has been applied to lesion studies in humans and animals. It has also been applied to efforts to record electrical activity from individual cells (or groups of cells) in higher primates (including some studies of human patients). It makes use of neuroscience, and shares an information processing view of the mind with cognitive psychology and cognitive science.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his other teachings, {{he was able to}} teach a psychological test and measurement course. Because he loved the mathematical portion of the course, he changed the class to aptitude testing, which focused on scientific basis of vocational guidance. On the side, Hull also conducted research to build a machine that could perform all the correlational work for him automatically. After teaching the aptitude testing class, Clark went on to teaching an introductory class for premedical students. While teaching this class he particularly took notice of suggestion and hypnosis. This was the starting point of his experimental testing in this field in which Clark focused on the quantitative methodology in experimental psychology. After ten years of in-depth research, he wrote the book Hypnosis and Suggestibility in 1933. After writing the book, he decided to continue in <b>experimental</b> <b>field</b> by teaching this course in {{addition to}} the premedical course. Clark had a great desire to teach this course and felt as though this specific type of science was the foundation of true psychology. In 1929 he was called to the Institute of Psychology at Yale University as a research professor of psychology where he worked on the problems concerning systematic behavior theory. In 1930, he came to several conclusions about psychology: the first was that he believed that psychology is a true natural science. The second was that its primary laws are expressed quantitatively by moderate number equations and that all complex behavior or single individuals will be derived as second laws. The third was that the primary laws with the behavior (based on the condition) can also be derived as quantitative laws from the same primary equation. he and other psychologists (Neal E. Miller, John Dollard, and O.H Mower) looked into these ideas more, they sought to understand what underlined conditioned reflex and behavior while also seeking to understand Freud and others like him. This eventually led to his work that he is primarily known for: Principles of Behavior.|$|E
500|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} (AD), {{the breaking}} down of biodegradable material by microorganisms {{in the absence}} of oxygen, is recognised as an effective method of waste disposal, with the potential to address the food waste problem nationally. AD technology has a small environmental impact, producing less greenhouse gas emissions than composting. However, although the process is well established in the water industry, it is less so within the waste sector. Despite this, the AD industry is being (and planned to be further) expanded by local councils and retailers to deal with food waste; several local authorities in the UK are planning to build anaerobic digestion plants, with the largest, to be located in Selby, due to operate from 2010. Supermarket chains Tesco and Sainsbury's are both adopting AD technology to dispose of their waste, while Tesco's head of waste and recycling said: [...] "As renewable energy technologies now become mainstream, there is no excuse for sending waste to landfill that could actually be put to positive use." [...] AD technology remains an <b>experimental</b> <b>field</b> though, and there is potential for advancements to increase efficiency. In July 2014 Sainsbury's began powering one of its stores using anaerobic digestion.|$|E

Accordingly this experiment investigated the benefit of foliar applied copper fertilizer on romaine lettuce (Lactuca Sativa Longifolia) grown in low soil Copper (Cu) concentration in the coastal Santa Maria, California. The various rates of Cu fertilizer applied include untreated (control), 100, 200, 400 and 800 grams per acre of CuSO 4. 5 H 2 O, using a one time and a split application methods. Three consecutive individual <b>experimental</b> <b>fields</b> were established starting in late spring through the fall of 2008.
