5|$|About 20,000 protein coding {{genes are}} {{expressed}} in human cells and 70% of these genes are <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> normal thyroid. Some 250 of these genes are more specifically <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thyroid with about 20 genes being highly thyroid specific. The corresponding specific proteins are mainly involved in thyroid hormone synthesis, such as thyroglobulin, TPO and IYD, and expressed in follicular cells. Other proteins elevated in the thyroid are calcitonin related proteins such as CALCA and CALCB, <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> parafollicular c-cells.|$|E
5|$|Thehuman genomeincludes {{approximately}} 20,000 protein coding {{genes and}} 70% of thesegenes are expressedin the normal, adult adrenal glands.Only some 250 genes are more specifically <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> adrenal glands {{compared to other}} organs and tissues.The adrenal gland specific genes with highest level of expression include members of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. Corresponding proteins are <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> different compartments of the adrenal gland, such as CYP11A1, HSD3B2 and FDX1 involved in steroid hormone synthesis and expressed in cortical cell layers, and PNMT and DBH involved in noradrenalin and adrenalin synthesis and <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> medulla.|$|E
5|$|Troponin I, slow {{skeletal}} muscle is a protein that in humans is encoded by the TNNI1 gene.

5|$|About 20,000 protein-coding {{genes are}} {{expressed}} in human cells and nearly 70% of these genes are <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> normal esophagus. Some 250 of these genes are more specifically <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> esophagus with less than 50 genes being highly specific. The corresponding esophagus-specific proteins are mainly involved in squamous differentiation such as keratins KRT13, KRT4 and KRT6C. Other specific proteins that help lubricate the inner surface of esophagus are mucins such as MUC21 and MUC22. Many genes with elevated expression are also shared with skin and other organs that are composed of squamous epithelia.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{there are}} two other isoforms of the {{catalytic}} subunit of PKA called Cβ and Cγ arising from different genes but have similar functions as Cα. Cβ is found abundantly in the brain and in lower levels in other tissues, while Cγ is most likely <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> testis.|$|E

5|$|A {{revival of}} {{interest}} in Hazlitt, as a thinker, began in the mid-20th century. His thoughts on Shakespeare's plays as a whole (particularly the tragedies), his discussions of certain characters such as Shylock, Falstaff, Imogen, Caliban and Iago and his ideas {{about the nature of}} drama and poetry in general, such as <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> essay on Coriolanus, gained renewed appreciation and influenced other Shakespearean criticism.|$|E
5|$|Although greatly {{obstructed}} by Ranavalona's policies, French and British {{political interests}} in Madagascar remained undiminished. Divisions between traditionalist and pro-European factions at the queen's court created opportunities that European intermediaries exploited {{in an attempt}} to hasten the succession of Ranavalona's son, Radama II. The young prince disagreed with many of his mother's policies and was amenable to French proposals for the exploitation of the island's resources, as <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lambert Charter he concluded with a French representative in 1855. These plans were never successful, however, and Radama II was not to take the throne until 1861, when Ranavalona died aged 83.|$|E
5|$|As it is {{constructed}} using tensors, general relativity exhibits general covariance: its laws—and further laws formulated within the general relativistic framework—take {{on the same}} form in all coordinate systems. Furthermore, the theory does not contain any invariant geometric background structures, i.e. it is background independent. It thus satisfies a more stringent general principle of relativity, namely that {{the laws of physics}} are the same for all observers. Locally, as <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> equivalence principle, spacetime is Minkowskian, and the laws of physics exhibit local Lorentz invariance.|$|E

5|$|As of 2017, {{just under}} 20,000 protein-coding genes {{are seen to}} be <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> human, and some 400 of these genes are brain-specific. The data that has been {{provided}} on gene expression in the brain has fuelled further research {{into a number of}} disorders. The long term use of alcohol for example, has shown altered gene expression in the brain, and cell-type specific changes that may relate to alcohol use disorder. These changes have been noted in the synaptic transcriptome in the prefrontal cortex, and are seen as a factor causing the drive to alcohol dependence, and also to other substance abuses.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} on, Louis XVIII {{realised}} that France would never accept {{an attempt to}} return to the Ancien Régime. Accordingly, he created another policy in 1805 with a view toward reclaiming his throne: a declaration that was far more liberal than his former ones. It repudiated his Declaration of Verona, promised to abolish conscription, retain Napoleon I's administrative and judicial system, reduce taxes, eliminate political prisons, and guarantee amnesty to everyone who did not oppose a Bourbon Restoration. The opinions <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> declaration were largely those of the Count of Avaray, Louis's closest associate in exile.|$|E
5|$|Dualism {{is a set}} {{of views}} about the {{relationship}} between mind and matter (or body). It begins with the claim that mental phenomena are, in some respects, non-physical. One of the earliest known formulations of mind–body dualism was <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eastern Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy (c. 650 BCE), which divided the world into purusha (mind/spirit) and prakriti (material substance). Specifically, the Yoga Sutra of Patanjali presents an analytical approach {{to the nature of the}} mind.|$|E

5|$|Eric Foner (2010) {{contrasts}} the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast who saw slavery as a sin, {{with the}} conservative Republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress. Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the republicanism principles of the Founding Fathers, especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Declaration of Independence.|$|E
5|$|Feuchtwanger {{was horrified}} and incensed {{at the way}} in which his work had been {{manipulated}} and distorted, calling Harlan's film a Schandwerk ("a shameful work"). In 1941, he wrote an open letter to seven actors.

5|$|Germany is a federal, parliamentary, {{representative}} democratic republic.
