500|$|The set {{was already}} being broken down {{the day after}} filming finished. Debra Messing, who plays Grace, said it was [...] "cordoned off like an {{accident}} scene. It {{was a shock to}} see parts of it gone already." [...] Each cast member was allowed to keep their favorite souvenir from the set. Messing took the door to Grace's office; she wanted to lean it up against the wall at her house as a piece of modern art. Sean Hayes was given a couple of pieces from Will's apartment: [...] "There's a leather box that was on Willâ€™s desk that <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a place for." [...] Mullally chose a simple portrait from one of the walls, and McCormack took a small ceramic dog, though he said he would have taken everything if he could.|$|E
500|$|As Frances Cleveland {{left the}} White House, {{she told a}} staff member, [...] "Now, Jerry, I {{want you to take}} good care of all the {{furniture}} and ornaments in the house, for <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> everything just as it is now, when we come back again." [...] When asked when she would return, she responded, [...] "We are coming back four years from today." [...] In the meantime, the Clevelands moved to New York City where Cleveland took a position with the law firm of Bangs, Stetson, Tracy, and MacVeigh. This affiliation was more of an office sharing arrangement, though quite compatible. Cleveland's law practice brought only a moderate income, perhaps because Cleveland spent considerable time at the couple's vacation home Gray Gables at Buzzard Bay, where fishing became his obsession. While they lived in New York, the Clevelands' first child, Ruth, was born in 1891.|$|E

"It's a {{song about}} a guy and a girl, and the concept is, at the {{beginning}} of the video, I find one of Sabi's photos, and she's feeling the same way that I'm feeling, which is incomplete without each other," [...] he said. [...] "We're sharing feelings, and that's what I realize, so I'm like, 'Wow, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> this girl.' So I look all over the world for her, and our world is the nightclub. The video is about the photo booth. It's just not any photo booth; it's a photo booth that tells you how you're really feeling. That's the main star of the video." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. That {{was what}} frightened me, and then {{interested}} me. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{out what they}} were like. But that isn't the secret." ...|$|R

6000|$|He looked splendidly helpless. [...] "That's {{just what}} <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out. Don't {{you keep the}} old ones?--can't you look it up?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] said Tom calmly. [...] "I was a chump <b>to</b> remain behind--only <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> you. <b>I</b> {{got hold}} of a letter by accident." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. I am from Maine, and I knew a Guardley {{up there}} who came <b>to</b> these diggings. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{out if it}} was the same man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] said Ichabod, [...] "oh, no, {{of course}} not; {{but you are}} here, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> you; a sugar {{plantation}} would be of no use without you." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes;--by chance," [...] said Lady Laura. [...] "But {{every one}} at Loughlinter always comes up here. If any one ever were missing whom <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>find,</b> {{this is where}} I should look." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} his name; that is just what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out <b>I</b> might have found his tailor's name on the coat, and then have {{discovered}} for whom the coat was made." ...|$|R
6000|$|Gerald smiled. [...] "I'm {{not going}} to give Askew a hint, if that is what you mean. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out if you'd shrink from him as you shrink from Alan, and I think I know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "First <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out {{if there}} is any truth in these letters," [...] {{answered}} Colonel Colby. [...] "Very frequently anonymous communications cannot be relied upon." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't know him--at least, I don't think I do. I've {{never seen}} him close enough to make sure. Maybe he's some fellow who belongs around here. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out about him--just as {{everybody}} else <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out, that's all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{aftermath}} of a contested election is a thing to escape from," [...] he said. [...] "I felt that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get {{as far away as}} possible, and then again <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out who it was who had sent that telegram." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It was not {{on earth}} at all," [...] he said; [...] "I came by water. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out if what I {{had heard of the}} horrors of a {{coastwise}} voyage were true; and I found that it was absolutely correct." ...|$|R

After finding out how the substance was addictive <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be able to classify what type of addiction each substance produced. I did this by analyzing many different articles and compiling my findings. My hypothesis was that both drugs produce physical addictions. Instead it was found that marijuana addictions are different than caffeine addictions. Marijuana addictions may start by being psychologically addictive and after continual usage develops into a physical addiction, whereas caffeine is physically addictive...|$|R

6000|$|... "That's what he said. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{out what}} he meant, but Larkspur stopped him from talking {{and told him to}} shut up. But, Dick, I feel sure they mean something, and all of you fellows better be on your guard," [...] added Stanley earnestly.|$|R
