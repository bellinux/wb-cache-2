40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis Applying the second-order <b>elections</b> {{model on}} the European Parliament <b>elections</b> in the Czech Republic {{deals with the}} theory of second-order <b>elections</b> {{and the possibility of}} its application to the European Parliament <b>elections</b> in the Czech Republic, which took place in 2004 and 2009. The first part of the work attends to origin and development of theories of second-order <b>elections.</b> The basis of the research of this theory was the first direct <b>elections</b> to the European Parliament in 1979. Based on the analyses of these <b>elections</b> the first comprehensive theory of second order <b>elections</b> was created by Karlheinz Reif and Hermann Schmitt. This theory was subsequently modified in consideration of the increasing <b>elections.</b> The second part of the work analyzes <b>elections</b> to the European Parliament in the Czech Republic in terms of the theory of second-order <b>elections,</b> i. e. verifies hypotheses resulting from this theory to the <b>elections</b> in 2004 and consequently in 2009. The final chapter is the comparison of obtained results, which verifies whether <b>elections</b> in 2004 show the same results as the <b>elections</b> in 2009. The aim is to verify the validity of hypotheses and based on that assess whether the European Parliament <b>elections</b> in the Czech Republic correspond to second-order <b>elections...</b>|$|R
