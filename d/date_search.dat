In machine learning, most methods to <b>date</b> <b>search</b> for maximum a posteriori sparse solutions and neglect to represent posterior uncertainties. In this paper, we address problems of Bayesian optimal design (or experiment planning), for which accurate estimates of uncertainty are essential. To this end, we employ expectation propagation approximate inference for the linear model with Laplace prior, giving new insight into numerical stability properties and proposing a robust algorithm. We also show how to estimate model hyperparameters by empirical Bayesian maximisation of the marginal likelihood, and propose ideas in order to scale up the method to very large underdetermined problems. We demonstrate the versatility of our framework on the application of gene regulatory network identification from micro-array expression data, where both the Laplace prior and the active experimental design approach are shown to result in significant improvements. We also {{address the problem of}} sparse coding of natural images, and show how our framework can be used for compressive sensing tasks. Part of this work appeared in (Seeger et al., 2007 b).

Objective: Aim {{of the present study}} is to detect a prognostic marker for neonatal sepsis. Material and methods: The present study was conducted on neonates admitted to pediatric ward of Desun Hospital and IPGME&R, Kolkata for a period of six months from January to July, 2014. Before and after administration of antibiotic course blood samples were collected and hematological parameters (MicroESR, total WBC count) were investigated. Serum procalcitonin (PCT) and C reactive protein (CRP) were also estimated by immunoassay kits as per manufactures protocol. Antibiotic sensitivity and blood culture for isolation of microorganisms were also performed. Results were expressed as mean ± SEM and analysis was done by SPSS version 12. Results: Out of 54 neonates, 40. 7 % have shown criteria of proven sepsis, 27. 7 % suspected sepsis and 31. 4 % clinical sepsis. 15 out of 22 neonates with proven sepsis have been reported with strongly positive serum PCT values. However, after 5 days antibiotic treatment, more than 60 % neonates have shown reduced PCT levels while no change in serum CRP and micro ESR were detected. Conclusions: Though procalcitonin has been well reported as a diagnostic marker for neonatal sepsis, it is however not well established as a prognostic marker. In the present study, we have reported serum PCT as a good prognostic marker for newborn sepsis. However, these results should be further validated with a large sample size...|$|E

Overview Peer-to-peer (or “P 2 P”) networks are emerging as a significant vehicle for providing distributed services (e. g., search, content integration and administration) both on the Internet [4, 5, 6, 7] and in enterprises. The idea is simple: rather than have a centralized service (say, for search), each node in a distributed network maintains its own index and search service. Queries no longer go to a central server; instead they fan out over the network, and results are collected and propagated back to the originating node. This allows for search results that are fresh (in the extreme, admitting dynamic content assembled from a transaction database, reflecting – say in a marketplace – real-time pricing and inventory information). Such freshness is not possible with traditional static indices, where the indexed content is a...|$|E

40|$|Feedback {{provided}} by the Antarctic community has proven instrumental in positively influencing {{the direction of the}} GCMD's development. For example, in response to requests for a stand alone metadata authoring tool, a new shareable software package called docBUILDER solo will be released to the public in March 2006. This tool permits researchers to document their data during experiments and observational periods in the field. The international polar community has also {{played a key role in}} encouraging support for the foreign language character set in the metadata display and tools (10 % of the records in the AMD hold foreign characters). In the upcoming release, the full ISO character set, which also includes mathematical symbols, will be supported. Additional upgrades include the ability for users to search for data sets based on pre-selected temporal and spatial resolution ranges. Data providers are strongly encouraged to populate the resolution fields for their data sets, although these fields are not currently required. In prior versions, browser incompatibilities often resulted in unreliable performance for users attempting to initiate a spatial search using a map based on Java applet technology. The GCMD will offer an integrated Google map and <b>date</b> <b>search,</b> replacing the applet technology and enhancing the geospatial and temporal searches. It is estimated that 30 % of the records in the AMD have direct access to data. A growing number of these records can be accessed through data service links. Related data services are therefore becoming valuable assets in facilitating the use and visualization of data. Users will gain the ability to refine services using the same options as those available for data set searches. Data providers are encouraged to describe available data-related services through the directory. Future plans include offering web services through a SOAP interface and extending semantic queries for the polar regions through the use of ontologies. The Open Archives Initiative's (OAI) Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (PMH) has been successfully tested with several organizations and appears to be a prime candidate for sharing metadata within the community. The GCMD anticipates contributing to the design of the data management system for the International Polar Year and to the ongoing efforts in the years to come.

Feedback provided through the international community has proven instrumental in positively influencing the direction of the IDN s development. The international community was instrumental in encouraging support for using the IS 0 international character set that is now available through the directory. Supporting metadata descriptions in additional languages encourages extended use of the IDN. Temporal and spatial attributes often prove pivotal in the search for data. Prior to the new software release, the IDN s geospatial and temporal searches suffered from browser incompatibilities and often resulted in unreliable performance for users attempting to initiate a spatial search using a map based on aging Java applet technology. The IDN now offers an integrated Google map and <b>date</b> <b>search</b> that replaces that technology. In addition, one of the most defining characteristics in the search for data relates to the temporal and spatial resolution of the data. The ability to refine the search for data sets meeting defined resolution requirements is now possible. Data set authors are encouraged to indicate the precise resolution values for their data sets and subsequently bin these into one of the pre-selected resolution ranges. New metadata authoring tools have been well received. In response to requests for a standalone metadata authoring tool, a new shareable software package called "docBUILDER solo" will soon be released to the public. This tool permits researchers to document their data during experiments and observational periods in the field. interoperability has been enhanced through the use of the Open Archives Initiative s (OAI) Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (PMH).

40|$|The {{information}} {{environment of}} {{the first decade of}} the XXIst century is unprecedented. The physical barriers limiting access to the knowledge are disappearing as traditional methods of accessing information are being replaced or enhanced by computer systems. Digital systems are able to manage much larger sets of documents, confronting information users with the deluge of documents related to their topic of interest. This new situation created an incentive for the rapid development of Data Mining techniques and to the creation of more efficient search engines capable of limiting the search results to a small subset of the most relevant ones. However, most of the up to <b>date</b> <b>search</b> engines operate using the text descriptions of the documents. Those descriptions can either be extracted from the content of the document or be obtained from the external sources. The retrieval based on the non-textual content of documents is a subject of ongoing research. In particular, the retrieval of images and unlocking the information carried by them attracts a lot of attention of the scientific community. Digital libraries hold a special position amongst the systems allowing the access to knowledge. They serve the role of repositories of documents which share some common characteristics (e. g. belonging to the same area of knowledge or produced in the same institution) and as such, contain documents selected as interesting for a particular group of users. In addition, they provide retrieval facilities on top of the managed collections. Typically, scholarly publications are the smallest units of information managed in scientific digital libraries. However, there are different types of artifacts produced and used in the scientific process, among others: figures and datasets. Figures play a particularly important role in the process of scholarly publishing. Representing data in a graphical manner allows showing patterns in large datasets and to make complicated ideas easier to understand. The existing digital library systems enable the access to figures only as part of the files used for the serialisation of the entire publication. The objective of this thesis is to propose a set of methods and techniques in order to transform figures into first-class products within the scientific publication process, allowing researchers to get the maximum benefit from the search and review of bibliography. The proposed methods and techniques are oriented towards the acquisition, semantic annotation and search of figures contained in scholarly publications. Leveraging the completeness of the field and the existing community, we illustrated the described theory with examples from High-Energy Physics (HEP). At every place requiring more focused considerations, we concentrated on the type of figures that appear more frequently in the corpus of HEP publications: the plots. The described prototypes capable of processing figures have been partially integrated with the Invenio digital library software and INSPIRE - one of the largest digital libraries in the world on High-Energy Physics and created by the collaboration of the main laboratories and research centres in this domain (CERN, SLAC, DESY and Fermilab) ...|$|E
