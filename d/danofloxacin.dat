40|$|Mycoplasma gallisepticum is the causative {{agent of}} chronic {{respiratory}} disease (CRD), a prevalent disease of poultry, {{which is responsible for}} significant economic losses in farms. Although several antimicrobial agents are currently recommended for the treatment and prevention of M. gallisepticum infections, investigations of M. gallisepticum have been hampered by their fastidious growth requirements and slow growth rate. As such, little work has been conducted concerning the PK/PD relationship and mechanisms of antibiotic resistance between antimicrobials against M. gallisepticum. In the present study, <b>danofloxacin</b> was orally administrated to the infected chickens once daily for 3 days by an established in vivo M. gallisepticum infection model. Not only the concentrations of <b>danofloxacin</b> in plasma and lung tissues were analyzed, but also the counting of viable cells and changes in antimicrobial susceptibility in air sac and lung were determined. The PK and PD data were fitted by WinNonlin to evaluate the PK/PD interactions of <b>danofloxacin</b> against M. gallisepticum. PCR amplification of quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) and DNA sequencing were performed to identify point mutations in gyrA, gyrB, parC, and parE of the selected resistant mutant strains. In addition, susceptibility of enrofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, and norfloxacin against these mutant strains were also determined. The PK profiles indicated that <b>danofloxacin</b> concentration in the lung tissues was higher than plasma. Mycoplasmacidal activity was achieved when infected chickens were exposed to <b>danofloxacin</b> at the dose group above 2. 5 mg/kg. The ratios of AUC 24 /MIC (the area under the concentration-time curve over 24 h divided by the MIC) for 2 log 10 (CFU) and 3 log 10 (CFU) reduction were 31. 97 and 97. 98 L h/kg, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Mycoplasma mycoides {{subspecies}} mycoides Small Colony (MmmSC) is the causative {{agent of}} Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia (CBPP), {{a disease of}} substantial economic importance in sub-Saharan Africa. Failure of vaccination to curtail spread of this disease has led to calls for evaluation {{of the role of}} antimicrobials in CBPP control. Three major classes of antimicrobial are effective against mycoplasmas, namely tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones and macrolides. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to determine the effector kinetics of oxytetracycline, <b>danofloxacin</b> and tulathromycin against two MmmSC field strains in artificial medium and adult bovine serum. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined for oxytetracycline, <b>danofloxacin</b> and tulathromycin against MmmSC strains B 237 and Tan 8 using a macrodilution technique, and time-kill curves were constructed for various multiples of the MIC over a 24 hour period in artificial medium and serum. Data were fitted to sigmoid E(max) models to obtain 24 hour-area under curve/MIC ratios for mycoplasmastasis and, where appropriate, for mycoplasmacidal activity and virtual mycoplasmal elimination. RESULTS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations against B 237 were 20 -fold higher, 2 -fold higher and approximately 330 -fold lower in serum than in artificial medium for oxytetracycline, <b>danofloxacin</b> and tulathromycin, respectively. Such differences were mirrored in experiments using Tan 8. Oxytetracycline was mycoplasmastatic against both strains in both matrices. <b>Danofloxacin</b> elicited mycoplasmacidal activity against B 237 and virtual elimination of Tan 8; similar maximum antimycoplasmal effects were observed in artificial medium and serum. Tulathromycin effected virtual elimination of B 237 but was mycoplasmastatic against Tan 8 in artificial medium. However, this drug was mycoplasmastatic against both strains in the more physiologically relevant matrix of serum. CONCLUSIONS: Oxytetracycline, <b>danofloxacin</b> and tulathromycin are all suitable candidates for further investigation as potential treatments for CBPP.

Subsequent tylosin treatment increased proportion of isolates with non-wild type MICs for erythromycin in both group A and B (< 0. 01) and, interestingly, proportion of isolates with non-wild type MICs for ciprofloxacin in group B (< 0. 001) with high MICs (128 μg/ml). PFGE analysis revealed treatments selecting predominant genotypes with variable resistance patterns and decreasing initial diversity of genotypes. The most common genotype had mainly high MICs for ciprofloxacin among danofloxacin-treated pigs but wild type MICs (below the ECOFF) among the controls housed in the same pens. This suggests that the non-wild type isolate was rarely transmitted or outcompeting wild type genotype in the control pigs without selection pressure.

Therapeutic treatment of animal diseases is necessary to reduce morbidity and mortality, {{as well as to}} decrease econom-ic losses to farmers. The fluoroquinolones are a class of anti-microbial agents uniquely suited for use in treatment of animal diseases due to their activity against a broad range of veteri-nary pathogens, particularly the gram-negative bacilli (1, 3). Several fluoroquinolones are approved or under development for animal health use in the United States or Europe, including enrofloxacin, <b>danofloxacin,</b> sarafloxacin, and marbofloxacin (1 – 3, 7).

40|$|Three {{studies are}} {{described}} in this report. In the first study, the effects of <b>danofloxacin</b> and tilmicosin on neutrophil function were examined in healthy mixed-breed weaned beef heifers. Neutrophils were isolated from peripheral blood samples pre- and post-treatment. The neutrophil function assays performed were: random migration under agarose, Cytochrome C reduction, iodination, Staphylococcus aureus ingestion, chemotaxis under agarose, and antibody-independent and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The results suggest that at therapeutic drug concentrations, <b>danofloxacin</b> and tilmicosin have little clinically significant effect on bovine neutrophil function. In the second study, a model was developed for the induction of pneumonic pasteurellosis (using 6 x 109 CFU of a log-phase culture of Pasteurella haemolytica intrabronchially) in weaned, pre-conditioned beef calves that consistently produced rectal temperatures of at least 40 °C 24 hours after bacterial challenge, a clinical score of ≥ 1, and measurable lung consolidation. In the third study, Pasteurella pneumonia was induced in weaned beef heifer calves using the model from the second study, and calves were treated with <b>danofloxacin</b> or tilmicosin. Neutrophils were collected at 3, 24 and 48 hours after treatment. Neutrophil function assays were as performed in study 1, and apoptosis was determined using a cell death detection kit. The results suggest that <b>danofloxacin</b> and tilmicosin have no clinically significant effects on neutrophil function or apoptosis. There were also {{no significant differences in}} percent lung consolidation among treatments. Significant differences were found between non-challenged calves and the challenged non-treated calves in several neutrophil assays, which were attributed to an effect of the Pasteurella infection. Body temperature was also examined in this study via intravaginally implanted radiotransmitters. Temperatures were monitored prior to challenge until necropsy at 72 hours after treatment. The areas under the curve of the temperature-time plot (and over a baseline temperature established for each animal) calculated for 3 -hour intervals were not significantly different for any of the time intervals when challenged animals were compared. Analysis of the mean 3 -hour interval temperatures showed significantly higher temperatures for saline-treated as compared to antimicrobialtreated animals {{for the majority of the}} time intervals, but no differences were found between the danofloxacin- or tilmicosin-treated animals...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{an experimental}} {{model of the}} pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relation-ship of <b>danofloxacin</b> against Mannheimia haemolytica infection, using subcutaneously implanted tissue cages in calves. Methods: Tissue cages implanted subcutaneously in calves were infected with M. haemolytica and different concentration–time profiles of <b>danofloxacin</b> were simulated. Drug concentrations and bacterial counts were monitored over time and various PK/PD parameters calculated. Results: By using different types of cage and various doses, a range of PK/PD indices were simulated. The PK/PD index that best predicted the antimicrobial effect was the AUC/MIC ratio. The magnitude of this index needed for near-maximum effect (80 %), assessed using the area under the bacterial kill curve to 48 h, was 244 h. Conclusions: The model described enabled different concentration–time profiles to be simulated, and PK/PD interactions to be studied {{in the presence of}} the host’s defences. The validity of this model needs to be confirmed by clinical studies, but the results suggest that it may be a useful intermediary step between in vitro and clinical studies...|$|E

The use of veterinary medicines may be cause of the presence of drug residues in animal food products if appropriate withdrawal periods are not respected or if contaminated feeds are used. This work presents the development of an high performance liquid chromatography with postcolumn fluorescence derivatization (HPLC-FLD) method for the quantitative detection of eight quinolones – norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, <b>danofloxacin,</b> enrofloxacin, difloxacin, oxolinic acid, nalidixic acid, and flumequine – in bovine milk. After deproteination and extraction with a metaphosphoric acid 1 % w/v/methanol/acetonitrile (60 / 20 / 20 v/v/v) solution, the sample is partially evaporated and cleaned up on a reversed phase solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridge. The extract is analyzed using an HPLC-FLD. Mean recovery ranged between 65 - 88 %. The method is validated as a confirmatory method according to Decision 2002 / 657 /EC.

40|$|International audienceCurrent {{knowledge}} about the expression of ABC transport proteins suggests that their expression is regulated {{by a variety of}} factors, including pathological conditions, and in particular inflammatory reactions to infection. As ABC transporters are major determinants of absorption, distribution and excretion of many antimicrobials, modulation of their activity may result in increased or decreased tissue levels of drugs, affecting the efficacy of treatment. As fluoroquinolones have been identified as modulators and substrates of a number of drug transporters, we evaluated the effect of <b>danofloxacin</b> mesylate and enrofloxacin treatment on the levels of expression of MDR 1 and MRP 2 mRNA in the intestines and livers of broilers with experimentally induced colibacillosis. MDR 1 mRNA expression was significantly decreased in infected animals and was partly restored over five days of treatment with orally administered <b>danofloxacin</b> mesylate or enrofloxacin. Changes in the level of expression of MRP 2 mRNA were less prominent. This study suggests that the treatment of colibacillosis with fluoroquinolones, which resulted in a significant clinical improvement of the animals, also restored the expression of drug transporters. This is of clinical importance as these ABC transporters significantly contribute to the functionality of important biological barriers, protecting the bird and specific tissues from pathogens and bacterial toxins...|$|E
