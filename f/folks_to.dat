5|$|The {{original}} {{set of rules}} prescribed that all games were to be played for ante. Garfield was partly inspired by the game of marbles and wanted <b>folks</b> <b>to</b> play with the cards rather than collect them. For Magic, each player removed a card at random from the deck they wished to play with and the two cards would be set aside as the ante. At {{the end of the}} match, the winner would take and keep both cards. Early sets included a few cards with rules designed to interact with this gambling aspect, allowing replacements of cards up for ante, adding more cards to the ante, or even permanently trading cards in play.|$|E

25|$|In 1948, Schulz {{tried to}} have Li'l Folks {{syndicated}} through the Newspaper Enterprise Association, a firm run by the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain. Schulz {{would have been an}} independent contractor for the syndicate, unheard of in the 1940s, but the deal fell through. Li'l Folks was dropped in early 1950. Later that year, Schulz approached the United Feature Syndicate - also operated by Scripps-Howard - with his best work from Li'l Folks. When his work was picked up by United Feature Syndicate, they decided to run the new comic strip he had been working on. This strip was similar in spirit to the panel comic, but it had a set cast of characters, rather than different nameless little folk for each page. The name Li'l Folks was too close to the names of two other comics of the time: Al Capp's Li'l Abner and a strip titled Little <b>Folks.</b> <b>To</b> avoid confusion, the syndicate settled on the name Peanuts, after the peanut gallery featured in the Howdy Doody TV show.|$|E

[...] Uber has defended this [...] "surge pricing" [...] on its website, arguing that without dynamic pricing, there would not be enough drivers to enable riders to get a ride immediately upon request. Uber cited an example of the aftermath of a sold out concert at Madison Square Garden when pricing was increased. During this event, the number of people who opened the Uber app increased 400%, but, due to the higher prices, the actual ride requests only rose slightly, enabling ride requests to be completed within the usual timeframe.|$|E

2500|$|Collider.com's Kayti Burt {{felt the}} episode of Arrow [...] "gets enough nostalgic hits {{in to make}} it work, while also giving us an {{exciting}} (batshit crazy) final act to launch us into the final part of the superhero crossover... Though the shared hallucination gimmick might lack long-term narrative consequence and feel like {{a bit of a}} 'Look, It's The 100th Episode!' plot device, it works because of the performance of all of the actors (including many returning ones) and the sentiment that this show has genuinely inspired in people." [...] Conversely, Burt [...] "was a bit sad that Arrow was robbed the opportunity of having a 100th episode outside of the already considerable demands of the crossover event, which were sometimes at odds with what this episode was trying to do... This episode was trying to do far too much and was therefore a bit of a mess, but it's hard to dislike an hour of TV that is earnestly trying to please its fans in so many different ways." [...] She gave the episode 3 stars out of 5. Sara Netzley, for Entertainment Weekly praised the episode, awarding it an [...] "A", saying [...] "Lots of Arrow action here, and not as much for The Flash/Supergirl <b>folks</b> <b>to</b> do. Still, it all worked beautifully. We get enough cross-team action to make it a treat for viewers of the Berlanti-verse while still forwarding the invasion story line – and honoring the characters, plots, and themes that have made Arrow such a satisfying show over the last four and a half seasons. It was a tall order, but the episode pulled it off." ...|$|E
