25|$|A second mostly {{complete}} skeleton (AMNH5886) {{was found}} in 1904 in Hell Creek Formation rocks at Crooked Creek in central Montana by Oscar Hunter, a rancher. Upon finding the partially exposed specimen, he and a companion argued {{about whether or not}} the remains were recent or fossil. Hunter demonstrated that they were brittle and thus stone by kicking the tops off the vertebrae, an act later lamented by the eventual collector Barnum Brown. Another cowboy, Alfred Sensiba, bought the specimen from Hunter for a pistol, and later sold it to Brown, who excavated it for the American Museum of Natural History in 1906. This specimen had a nearly complete vertebral column, permitting the restoration of Cope's specimen. In 1907, these two specimens were mounted side-by-side in the American Museum of Natural History, under the name Trachodon mirabilis. Cope's specimen is positioned on all fours with its head down, as if feeding, because it has the better skull, while Brown's specimen, with a less perfect skull, is posed bipedally with the head less accessible. Henry Fairfield Osborn described the tableau as representing the two animals feeding along a marsh, the standing individual having been startled by the approach of a Tyrannosaurus.

The most significant extract obtained from <b>Ginkgo</b> biloba <b>leaves</b> has been EGb 761, a widely used phytopharmaceutical product in Europe. EGb 761 is a well-defined mixture of active compounds, which contains two main active substances: flavonoid glycosides (24 – 26 %) and terpene lactones (6 – 8 %). These compounds have shown antiapoptotic effects through the protection of mitochondrial membrane integrity, inhibition of mitochondrial cytochrome c release, enhancement of antiapoptotic protein transcription, and reduction of caspase transcription and DNA fragmentation. Other effects include the reduction of oxidative stress (which has been related to the occurrence of vascular, degenerative, and proliferative diseases), coupled to strong induction of phase II-detoxifying and cellular defense enzymes by Nrf 2 /ARE activation, {{in addition to the}} modulation of transcription factors, such as CREB, HIF- 1 α, NF-κB, AP- 1, and p 53, involved in the apoptosis process.

The compound eyes are prominent and occupy most of the lateral head that was originally exposed. The legs are extremely long and gracile, and are covered by numerous circular pubescence. Up to eight segments of the abdomen are preserved, but the terminal ones are missing making it impossible to determine the sex. The most important diagnostic features are the wings, the branches and venation of which are strikingly {{similar to those of the}} ginkgoean leaves.

50|$|Dr McLoughlin is a palaeobotanist {{with the}} Department of Palaeobiology, Swedish Museum of Natural History who has carried out {{research}} on the fossil floras of the Winton Formation since the mid-1990s. In recent years he has studied bennettitalean, conifer and horsetail fossils from Belmont Station held in the AAOD Museum collection. The significance of the Winton Formation fossil flora is that it represents the youngest major assemblage of plant fossils from the Cretaceous of Australia. Stratigraphically, the next major plant assemblage on the continent is from the late Paleocene - some 35 million years later. The Winton Formation plant assemblage marks the transition from gymnosperm to angiosperm dominance in the Australian floras. The Winton Formation flora is now known to contain over 50 macrofossil plant taxa. Significantly, this assemblage contains the youngest Australian fossils of equisetaleans, pentoxylaleans, and possibly bennettitaleans - all groups that appear to have succumbed to competition from the rapidly diversifying angiosperms of this time. One of the youngest records of <b>Ginkgo</b> <b>leaves</b> from Australia also comes from the Winton Formation. Araucarian, cupressacean and podocarp conifers are all well represented in the fossil flora. The flowering plants represented in this flora have mostly toothed or lobed leaf types and are of possible fagaceous or betulaceous affinities but their precise relationships remain unclear. The oldest Australian monocot angiosperms are also known from this formation. The composition of the flora and morphological characters of the leaves and woods attest to growth in a cool seasonal climate without extremes of precipitation.|$|E

Based on the experimental results of kinetics of <b>Ginkgo</b> biloba <b>leaves</b> extraction with supercritical carbon dioxide, modeling of the extraction system of Ginkgo biloba-supercritical CO 2 was done.

To better understand the impacts of fertilization on Ginkgo productivity, the effects of fertilization treatments (single fertilizer and combined fertilizer) on growth, nutrient content in <b>Ginkgo</b> <b>leaves,</b> and photosynthesis characteristics were studied in a 10 -year-old Ginkgo plantation over two years. The single factor experiments suggested that DBH (diameter at breast height), H (height), NSL (length of new shoots), and V (trunk volume) showed significant differences between the different levels of single nitrogen (N) or phosphate (P) fertilizer application. Orthogonal test results showed that the nine treatments all promoted the growth of Ginkgo, and the formula (N: 400 g·tree− 1, P: 200 g·tree− 1, potassium (K) : 90 g·tree− 1) was the most effective.

40|$|The {{effect on}} methanogens {{attached}} {{to the surface of}} rumen ciliate protozoa by the addition of plant extracts (pine needles and <b>ginkgo</b> <b>leaves)</b> was studied with particular reference to their effectiveness for decreasing methane emission.

The microbial population including bacteria, ciliated-associated methanogen, four different groups of methanogens and Fibrobacter succinogenes were quantified by using the real-time PCR. Gas profiles including methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen, and runinal fermentation characteristics were observed in vitro. The methane emission from samples with an addition of individual juices from pine needles, <b>ginkgo</b> <b>leaves</b> and 70 % ethanol extract from ginko leaves was significantly lower (p< 0. 05, 27. 1, 28. 1 and 28. 1 vs 34. 0 ml/g DM) than that of the control, respectively. Total VFAs in samples with an addition of any of the plant extracts were significantly lower than that of the control (p< 0. 05) as well. The order Methanococcales and the order Methanosarcinales were not detected by using PCR in any incubated mixtures. The ciliate-associated methanogens population decreased from 25 % to 49 % in the plant extacts as compared to control. We speculate that the supplementation of juice from pine needles and <b>ginkgo</b> <b>leaves</b> extract (70 % ethanol extract) decreased the protozoa population resulting in a reduction of methane emission in the rumen and thus inhibiting methanogenesis. The order Methanobacteriales community was affected by addition of all plant extracts and decreased to less than the control, while the order Methanomicrobiales population showed an increase to more than that of the control. The F. succinogenes, the major fibrolytic microorganism, population in all added plant extracts was increased to greater than that of the control. In conclusion, pine needles and <b>ginkgo</b> <b>leaves</b> extracts appear to have properties that decrease methanogenesis by inhibiting protozoa species and may have a potential for use as additives for ruminants...|$|E
