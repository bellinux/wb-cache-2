Meanwhile, Senator Mobina Jaffer argued in debates of the Senate, [...] "Amanda Todd's and Rehtaeh Parsons’ lives would have been no different if this bill had been enacted earlier". This legislation will make it illegal to distribute images of a person, in any way without their consent. It is said this could also violate people's privacy by giving authorities more power to watch what they are doing online. Police now only need [...] "reasonable grounds for suspicion" [...] to get a warrant. These warrants can now include allowing police to access online data, phone records and <b>digital</b> <b>tracking.</b> [...] "The bill also grants immunity to telecoms that voluntarily hand over data, a sticking point raising privacy concerns."

40|$|We {{describe}} <b>digital</b> <b>tracking,</b> {{a method}} for asteroid searches that greatly increases the sensitivity of a telescope to faint unknown asteroids. It has been previously used to detect faint Kuiper Belt objects using the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based instruments, and to find a small, fast-moving asteroid during a close approach to Earth. We complement this earlier work by developing <b>digital</b> <b>tracking</b> methodology for detecting asteroids using large-format CCD imagers. We demonstrate that the technique enables the ground-based detection {{of large numbers of}} new faint asteroids. Our methodology resolves or circumvents all major obstacles to the large-scale application of <b>digital</b> <b>tracking</b> for finding main belt and near-Earth asteroids. We find that for both asteroid populations, <b>digital</b> <b>tracking</b> can deliver a factor of ten improvement over conventional searches. <b>Digital</b> <b>tracking</b> has long been standard practice for deep Kuiper Belt surveys, but even there our methodology enables deeper integrations than have yet been attempted. Our search for main belt asteroids using a one-degree imager on the 0. 9 m WIYN telescope on Kitt Peak validates our methodology, delivers sensitivity to asteroids in a regime previously probed only with 4 -meter and larger instruments, and leads to the detection of 156 previously unknown asteroids and 59 known objects in a single field. <b>Digital</b> <b>tracking</b> has the potential to revolutionize searches for faint moving objects ranging from the Kuiper Belt through main belt and near-Earth asteroids, and perhaps even anthropogenic space debris in low Earth orbit.

40|$|Methods for {{measuring}} the health and performance of Communities of Practice (CoP) have traditionally been limited to surveys and interviews of the membership. Practically, this means that assessments can only be done infrequently, having {{to be mindful of}} “survey fatigue ” as the enthusiasm for participation in surveys drops off with each subsequent application. As communities begin to make greater use of electronic support tools, the potential for using digitally tracked activities i. e. digital footprints, as proxy measures for actual CoP activity, is increasing. Two experiments with <b>digital</b> <b>tracking</b> of community activities are presented. The first experiment uses electronic discussion group data fed into a Social Network Analysis (SNA) visualisation tool to analyse activity patterns over a two year period. The second experiment compares a traditional SNA of a Global Network with an electronically derived sociogram using usage data collected from the web based CoP support tool used by the Network. The results were encouraging, confirming the potential for <b>digital</b> <b>tracking.</b> In particular, active discussion group analysis using SNA tools to help visualise the interactions, told quite plausible stories of what was actually happening in the networks. <b>Digital</b> <b>tracking</b> of community activity is seen as a useful adjunct to the more traditional CoP metrics. As we move more actively into the electronic age, the value and validity of non-intrusive methods like <b>digital</b> <b>tracking,</b> will become much more widespread...|$|E

40|$|To {{design a}} high {{resolution}} spectrum estimation module {{as part of}} a <b>digital</b> <b>tracking</b> array system, the theory and mathematical formulations of several high resolution spectrum estimation methods are presented. In the implementation of a spectrum estimation system, the received signal is first down-converted to baseband frequency using single channel or in-phase (I) and quad phase (Q) channel down-converter before it is digitized using an analog-to-digital (ADC) converter. Three distinct frequency estimation methods, namely multiple signal classification (MUSIC), estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT) and multi-resolution spectrum sensing (MRSS), are simulated to detect the inherent frequencies of a test signal. The performances, such as estimation accuracy, frequency resolution, processing speed, observation time, and resilience to noise, are measured and evaluated. Comparing the simulation results, the MRSS out-performs the MUSIC and ESPRIT in terms of spectral resolution, estimation accuracy, and robustness to noise. Though the MRSS requires a higher observation time and processing time, the values remain significantly low at 13 us and 2. 4 us, respectively for SNR equals to - 10 dB. Hence, the MRSS is proposed as the frequency estimation algorithm in the <b>digital</b> <b>tracking</b> array to provide accurate, robust, and high resolution spectrum estimation.

40|$|A {{digital signal}} {{processor}} and processing method therefor for use in receivers of the NAVSTAR/GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS) employs a digital carrier down-converter, digital code correlator and <b>digital</b> <b>tracking</b> processor. The digital carrier down-converter and code correlator consists of an all-digital, minimum bit implementation that utilizes digital chip and phase advancers, providing exceptional control and accuracy in feedback phase and in feedback delay. Roundoff and commensurability errors {{can be reduced to}} extremely small values (e. g., less than 100 nanochips and 100 nanocycles roundoff errors and 0. 1 millichip and 1 millicycle commensurability errors). The <b>digital</b> <b>tracking</b> processor bases the fast feedback for phase and for group delay in the C/A, P. sub. 1, and P. sub. 2 channels on the L. sub. 1 C/A carrier phase thereby maintaining lock at lower signal-to-noise ratios, reducing errors in feedback delays, reducing the frequency of cycle slips and in some cases obviating the need for quadrature processing in the P channels. Simple and reliable methods are employed for data bit synchronization, data bit removal and cycle counting. Improved precision in averaged output delay values is provided by carrier-aided data-compression techniques. The signal processor employs purely digital operations in the sense that exactly the same carrier phase and group delay measurements are obtained, to the last decimal place, every time the same sampled data (i. e., exactly the same bits) are processed...|$|E

40|$|Radiation {{therapy with}} protons {{as of today}} {{utilizes}} information from x-ray CT in order to estimate the proton stopping power of the traversed tissue in a patient. The conversion from x-ray attenuation to proton stopping power in tissue introduces range uncertainties {{of the order of}} 2 – 3 % of the range, uncertainties that are contributing to an increase of the necessary planning margins added to the target volume in a patient. Imaging methods and modalities, such as Dual Energy CT and proton CT, have come into consideration in the pursuit of obtaining an as good as possible estimate of the proton stopping power. In this study, a <b>Digital</b> <b>Tracking</b> Calorimeter is benchmarked for proof-of-concept for proton CT purposes. The <b>Digital</b> <b>Tracking</b> Calorimeter was originally designed for the reconstruction of high-energy electromagnetic showers for the ALICE-FoCal project. The presented prototype forms the basis for a proton CT system using a single technology for tracking and calorimetry. This advantage simplifies the setup and reduces the cost of a proton CT system assembly, and it is a unique feature of the <b>Digital</b> <b>Tracking</b> Calorimeter concept. Data from the AGORFIRM beamline at KVI-CART in Groningen in the Netherlands and Monte Carlo simulation results are used to in order to develop a tracking algorithm for the estimation of the residual ranges of a high number of concurrent proton tracks. High energy protons traversing the detector leave a track through the sensor layers. These tracks are spread out through charge diffusion processes. A charge diffusion model is applied for acquisition of estimates of the deposited energy of the protons in each sensor layer by using the size of the charge diffused area. A model fit of the Bragg Curve is applied to each reconstructed track and through this, estimating the residual range of each proton. The range of the individual protons can at present be estimated with a resolution of 4 %. The readout system for this prototype is able to handle an effective proton frequency of 1  MHz by using 500 concurrent proton tracks in each readout frame, which is at the high end range of present similar prototypes. A future further optimized prototype will enable a high-speed and more accurate determination of the ranges of individual protons in a therapeutic beam...|$|E
