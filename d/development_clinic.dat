40|$|In {{speaking}} about “impact” clinical legal education, {{it is almost}} always exclusively as litigation—innocence projects, representing Guantanamo detainees, human rights concerns, environmental issues. Though these clinical efforts target different societal ills, all try to use the legal system {{as a catalyst for}} change. Rarely do clinicians invoke the word “impact” in the same manner in discussing transactional legal work much less transactional clinics. Yet transactional clinics can and do perform impact work. This article describes the current landscape of transactional clinics, the distinct evolution of community economic <b>development</b> <b>clinics</b> from small business and organizations clinics and argues that both can expand their vision of impact and employ new strategies to affect change. The article discusses the importance of clinic design in assuring that impact work is not undertaken at the expense of students’ educations. It argues that clinic design is comprised of three separate dimensions—service, skills development, and pedagogy—each of which influences and is influenced by the type of work that a clinic undertakes. The article suggests that clinicians should deliberately assess each dimension in determining its effect by an impact strategy. The article concludes by describing particular impact strategies the author employs in the clinic he directs, {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} such strategies, and encourages transactional clinicians to expand their conception of “impact” transactional work...|$|R

50|$|Newson {{first began}} to look at PDA as a {{specific}} syndrome in the 1980s when certain children referred to the Child <b>Development</b> <b>Clinic</b> at Nottingham University appeared to display and share {{many of the same}} characteristics. These children had often been referred because they seemed to show many autistic traits but were not typical in their presentation like those with classical autism or Asperger's syndrome. They had often been labelled as 'atypical autism' or PDD-NOS. Both of these terms were felt by parents to be unhelpful. She wrote up her findings in several papers based on increasingly larger groups of children. In 2003 this culminated in a proposal published in Archives of Diseases in Childhood for PDA to be recognised as a separate syndrome within the pervasive developmental disorders.|$|E
50|$|The Baylor Teen Health Clinic traces {{its roots}} {{back to the}} Joyce Goldfarb <b>Development</b> <b>Clinic,</b> {{established}} in 1969 as a one-day per week maternity clinic located in the Jefferson Davis Hospital. Jefferson Davis Hospital was delivering over 10,000 babies per year, {{at a time when}} Texas had an infant mortality rate of over 20 deaths per 1,000 live births. When Dr. Goldfarb died unexpectedly in 1972, the clinic lost its Rockefeller Grant funding. Dr. Peggy Smith was hired with the intention to shut down the clinic, but she decided to revive the clinic in 1971 and shifted its focus to reproductive care, serving males and females ages 13-22. Dr. Smith has since established outreach clinics beyond the Texas Medical Center in community locations and high school campuses with low-income, uninsured, indigent populations. The Teen Health Clinics serve neighborhoods known for high rates of infant mortality, sexuality transmitted infections and teen pregnancy.|$|E

40|$|There is some {{evidence}} that rates of out of hours calls in army general practices are higher than the average for the NHS. In an attempt to reduce out of hours demand a programme of preventive and educational initiatives for patients was introduced at an army practice in Hohne, West Germany early in 1985. This included regular child <b>development</b> <b>clinics,</b> well woman clinics, a practice booklet and leaflets about the management of simple illnesses, a library of books and videos for patients and health education videos in the waiting room. The project was complemented by an audit of doctors' prescribing habits followed by drawing up agreed protocols for the treatment of common disorders such as sore throat. Annual attendance rates per registered patient were recorded for 1984 - 86 to compare use of out of hours services by patients before and after the introduction of the project. Out of hours attendance rates fell by 35 % (from 0. 17 per annum to 0. 11 per annum) overall and by 61 % in young children. The total annual attendance rate dropped by 14 % (from 5. 13 to 4. 43) during the same period, but fell by only 1 % over the same period at a similar practice in Osnabruck. The decrease was particularly marked for out of hours attendances which the doctor classified as lower urgency: attendances classed as very low urgency decreased by 78 % between 1984 and 1986 but those classed as medium urgency decreased by only 2 %.
