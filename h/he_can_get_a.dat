By irradiating his groin with a microwave oven, Randy successfully gives himself testicular cancer, making his testicles so large that he has to use a wheelbarrow to carry them.

500|$|To {{voice the}} central {{character}} of the series, Hillenburg turned to Tom Kenny, whose career in animation had started alongside Hillenburg's on Rocko's Modern Life. Elements of Kenny's own personality were employed in further developing the character. Initially, Hillenburg {{wanted to use the}} name SpongeBoy— the character would have had no last name, and the series would have been called SpongeBoy Ahoy! However, the Nickelodeon legal department discovered— after voice acting had been completed for the original seven-minute pilot episode— that the name [...] "SpongeBoy" [...] was already in use for a mop product. A {{character of the}} same name was also already trademarked by Flaming Carrot Comics creator Bob Burden. In choosing a replacement name, Hillenburg felt that he still had to use the word [...] "Sponge", so that viewers would not mistake the character for a [...] "Cheese Man". He settled on the name [...] "SpongeBob". [...] "SquarePants" [...] was then chosen as a family name after Kenny saw a picture of the character and remarked, [...] "Boy, look at this sponge in square pants, thinking <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> job in a fast food place." [...] Hillenburg loved the phrase upon hearing Kenny say it and felt that it would reinforce the character's nerdiness.|$|E

Pam points out that {{if she were to}} get a new computer for one sales rep, she would have to get one for every sales rep. Unwilling to let it go, Andy convinces Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) into trading computers with him. Pam is angry when she finds out, and forces him to switch the computers back. In addition to continue pushing for a new computer, Andy confronts Pam about humiliating him in front of the office. In order to make it up to him, she tells him that the only way <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> new computer is if his breaks. To accomplish this, he accepts all cookies, intentionally opens pop-up ads, and places food in the disc drive. Pam then buys Andy a new computer, but they scratch it up to make it not look brand new. When they pretend to argue about {{it in front of the}} office, Pam claims that she found it in the warehouse. Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) confronts Pam later regarding finding the computer in the warehouse. As he knows everything that is in the warehouse and where it is stored, he leverages Pam into giving him more sick days. Pam gleefully tells the interviewers that she is now [...] "full-on corrupt".|$|E

2500|$|When Simmons {{first started}} his website, he wrote {{what he thought}} friends would enjoy reading because he never {{understood}} how people could be sportswriters while claiming they did not care which team won, {{in the name of}} journalistic objectivity. Since Simmons was writing on the web he figured that [...] "in order to get people to read it, it had to be different from what people got in newspapers and magazines." [...] He believes his job is not to get into the heads of the players, but into the heads of his readers.
