50|$|Russian Post {{operates}} 13 {{points of}} customs clearance of postal items. Until 2013, the Moscow MMPO processed up to 80% of all <b>incoming</b> <b>international</b> shipments to Russia which created much {{stress on the}} Russian Post. In order {{to speed up the}} time for delivery of international parcels, the Russian Post opened two new <b>international</b> postal <b>exchange</b> points in Yekaterinburg and Novosibirsk. The latter one can process up to two thousand international EMS-daily departures, with an area more than 2,000 square meters. The Yekaterinburg Koltsovo <b>international</b> postal <b>exchange</b> point is the first <b>international</b> postal <b>exchange</b> in the Urals Federal District. It can handle up to 20,000 parcels and small packets per day in the 3,700m facility. Until the end of 2014 Russian Post expects to reduce the Moscow point of exchange share to 55%. In addition there are exchange points in Bryansk, Samara, Orenburg, Petrozavodsk and Vladivostok.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a {{suggested}} framework for improving the understanding of consumer receptiveness to <b>incoming</b> <b>international</b> retailers. The consumer perception of country of origin against consumer receptiveness index (CRI) is proposed as a method to explore the receptiveness of consumers in the host market to <b>incoming</b> <b>international</b> retailers. This paper reviews the international retailing literature, highlighting the need for specific knowledge regarding consumer receptiveness to <b>incoming</b> <b>international</b> retailers. A method is proposed to explore how consumers in the host market respond to <b>incoming</b> <b>international</b> retail firms. The literature review indicates that the majority of the extant work investigates the process from the perspective of the internationalising retailer, while consumer receptiveness to the international retailer has not been fully considered. This paper does not present an empirical study. The consumer perception of country of origin against CRI is presented as a means to suggest and guide future research in the area. The paper makes a practical contribution by suggesting a method to explore how consumers in the host country receive <b>incoming</b> <b>international</b> retailers. This paper is unique because previous research has provided limited knowledge of consumer receptiveness to international retailers...|$|R

There is no public discussion of the adoption of IBAN identifiers for <b>incoming</b> <b>international</b> transactions. Any process towards IBAN would involve considerable changes to bank software and computer systems, and the requirement for financial institutions to adopt defined length account numbers. Outgoing international transfers must use either the SWIFT or IBAN system in use in the destination country, which would incorporate that country's format for BBAN.|$|R

50|$|The IMP mentors are student {{volunteers who}} {{use their own}} {{experience}} as international students to advise the <b>incoming</b> <b>international</b> freshmen about life at Brown. Students {{who want to be}} mentors apply for a position during spring. This is a fairly competitive process as 60-80 students apply for 22 places as a mentor. When the mentors are selected, they begin their work in the summer. The mentors are assigned a region of the world and they communicate with students in the respective regions via email.

5000|$|As {{the number}} of <b>incoming</b> <b>international</b> freshmen {{increase}} at Brown, the IMP is looking {{for new ways to}} assist the students in their transitions. The IMP may employ more mentors to accommodate the rising number of <b>incoming</b> <b>international</b> students. In 2011, the IMP introduced new events by collaborating with the Writing Center to make students aware of academic writing and plagiarism at Brown. The IMP also plans to start having mentors contact all accepted international students before the summer, instead of only the ones who have enrolled into Brown. The IMP plans to do this in order to make all accepted international freshmen feel a part of the Brown community before they decide to enroll into the university.|$|R
40|$|Universities in Malaysia are {{reaching}} out to international students. These students need access to information for their academic needs. Due to unfamiliarity with the new information environment, <b>incoming</b> <b>international</b> students often face barriers associated with information acquisition that may hinder their academic success. To better serve these students, academic libraries need {{a better understanding of}} the nature of barriers that the students face in meeting their information needs. The purpose of this study was to examine the main information channels of <b>incoming</b> <b>international</b> students at three major public universities in Malaysia and to identify the main barriers in meeting their information needs. A questionnaire-based survey method was used for data collection. The sample comprised 115 randomly selected <b>incoming</b> <b>international</b> students from University Malaya, University Putra Malaysia and University Kebangsaan Malaysia.
