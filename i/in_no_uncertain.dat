5|$|His writing {{style is}} best {{described}} as equal parts anger, confidence, and pageantry. Scalia has a taste for garish analogies and offbeat allusions—often very funny ones—and he speaks <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>uncertain</b> terms. He is highly accessible and tries not to get bogged down in abstruse legal jargon. But most of all, Scalia's opinions read like they're about to catch fire for pure outrage. He does not, in short, write like a happy man.|$|E

Ray, an {{officer who had}} escaped from the Philippines with him in 1942. Ray had been appointed to command the battleship , and Tarbuck was chosen to replace him. En route to Australia, Tarbuck met with Admiral Chester Nimitz, who told him <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>uncertain</b> terms that anti-Army and anti-MacArthur sentiments had no place in his command. As it was, Tarbuck became a loyal supporter of MacArthur.|$|E
5000|$|The {{term was}} used in 1998 by author and {{economist}} Daniel Yergin in a Newsweek article that described the end-state of the globalization process, and in his book, Commanding Heights: The Battle for the World Economy. Though Yergin was credited with having coined it, the word is in fact much older. William Safire traces the etymology of “globality” <b>in</b> his book <b>No</b> <b>Uncertain</b> Terms and identifies a range of citations {{as far back as}} 1942, when it was used as a synonym for “global.” Current use of “globality” as it applies to business - as a description of the current competitive state of world commerce - was not adopted until recently. The book: Globality: Competing with Everyone from Everywhere for Everything, Hal Sirkin Jim Hemerling Arindam Bhattacharya June 11, 2008, elaborates on how 'challenger' businesses from rapidly developing economies abroad are aggressively and inventively overtaking existing 'incumbent' nations.|$|R

5|$|Returning to naval service {{some months}} after the action, Harvey was given the 80-gun HMS Tonnant as his first flagship, in which he {{remained}} until 1809. Serving under Lord Gambier in the Channel Fleet, Harvey was outraged not to be given command of the British ships in action at the Battle of Basque Roads. Harvey expressed his disgust that command {{had been given to}} the more junior Lord Cochrane <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>uncertain</b> terms to Gambier, and was dismissed from the admiral's council as a result. When the operation was initially successful, Gambier refused to support Cochrane and as a result an opportunity to annihilate the French Atlantic Fleet was lost. The ensuing dispute lasted years and involved a court martial that eventually acquitted Gambier, and only ended with Cochrane's dismissal from the service five years later.|$|E
5|$|Turner had his {{own reasons}} for wanting Alderson gone, {{following}} the Battle of St-Eloi in April 1916. After British troops had taken a large crater near {{the ruins of the}} Belgian town of St Eloi, a brigade of Turner's division was ordered to hold the gain against German counter-attacks. Due to dreadful management of the Canadian forces by Turner and Brigadier-General Huntly Ketchen, German soldiers overran the crater, causing 1,400 Canadian casualties and retaking the land around the crater, negating the gains made at heavy cost just a few days before. Sir Herbert Plumer, the commander of British 2nd Army who had overall responsibility for the front, demanded Ketchen's immediate dismissal and when Turner claimed that if Ketchen was dismissed he would resign, Alderson sought his dismissal as well. Both officers were supporters of Sam Hughes, who made it clear <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>uncertain</b> terms to Commander in Chief Sir Douglas Haig that if Turner went then Haig could no longer rely on Canadian support.|$|E

At last, having defeated many hostile knights along the way, Ipomadon, the maiden and her dwarf arrive near the city where the Proud is being besieged. Lyoline is on horseback outside the city wall, shouting great boasts. Ipomadon removes himself to a forest nearby, while the maiden enters the city. Ipomadon sends his cousin out to discover what colour armour Lyoline is wearing. He is wearing black armour and is riding a black horse. Ipomadon dons black armour and rides out on a black horse, to challenge Lyoline to single combat for the hand of the Proud.|$|E

6000|$|The {{culmination}} {{of all this}} confusion we see in Proclus. The unfortunate Hypatia, who {{is the most important}} personage between him and Iamblichus, has left no writings to our times; we can only judge of her doctrine by that of her instructors and her pupils. Proclus was taught by the men who had heard her lecture; and the golden chain of the Platonic succession descended from her to him. His throne, however, was at Athens, not at Alexandria. After the murder of the maiden philosopher, Neoplatonism prudently retired to Greece. But Proclus is so essentially the child of the Alexandrian school that we cannot pass him over. Indeed, according to M. Cousin, as I am credibly informed, he is the Greek philosopher; the flower and crown of all its schools; in whom, says the learned Frenchman, [...] "are combined, and from whom shine forth, <b>in</b> <b>no</b> irregular or <b>uncertain</b> rays, Orpheus, Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, Zeno, Plotinus, Porphyry, and Iamblichus;" [...] and who [...] "had so comprehended all religions in his mind, and paid them such equal reverence, that he was, as it were, the priest of the whole universe!" ...|$|R

60|$|Thus at {{fourteen}} she {{had made}} up her mind about me, and <b>in</b> <b>no</b> timorous or <b>uncertain</b> terms had set down her reasons for her opinion. Fifteen years were to pass before any other critic--except Mr. Howells, I think--was to reutter that daring opinion and print it. Right or wrong, it was a brave position for that little analyser to take. She never withdrew it afterward, nor modified it. She has spoken of herself as lacking physical courage, and has evinced her admiration of Clara's; but she had moral courage, which is the rarest of human qualities, and she kept it functionable by exercising it. I think that in questions of morals and politics she was usually on my side; but when she was not she had her reasons and maintained her ground. Two years after she passed out of my life I wrote a Philosophy. Of the three persons who have seen the manuscript only one understood it, and all three condemned it. If she could have read it, she also would have condemned it, possibly,--probably, in fact--but she would have understood it. It would have had no difficulties for her on that score; also she would have found a tireless pleasure in analyzing and discussing its problems.|$|R
