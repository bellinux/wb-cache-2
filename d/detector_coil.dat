In view of the shortages of sensors fixed inside the pipeline and sensors fixed in the side hole of pipeline, a new detection device is designed, which is installed outside the pipeline and doesn’t destroy the pipeline in the sensors installation and maintenance. The detection fundamentals, sensor structure, signal handling system and ball-passing judgment method are described in detail. The detection system includes two parts: detection sensor and signal handling unit. The sensor is composed of two semicircular parts, each part consists of one exciter <b>coil</b> and two <b>detector</b> <b>coils</b> connected differentially. The signal handling unit utilizes direct digital synthesis (DDS) technique, ultrahigh speed phase/frequency discriminator and amplitude detector, so the ball-passing signal can be clearly picked-up.

40|$|One of {{the primary}} instabilities {{limiting}} {{the performance of the}} plasma in advanced tokamak operating regimes is the resistive wall mode (RWM) [1]. The most common RWM seen in the DIII-D tokamak is originated by an n= 1 ideal external kink mode which, {{in the presence of a}} resistive wall, is converted to a slowly growing RWM. The mode causes a reduction in plasma rotation, a loss of stored energy, and sometimes leads to plasma disruption. It routinely limits the performance of a tokamak operating near reactor relevant parameter levels. A system designed to actively control the RWM has recently been installed on the DIII-D tokamak for the control of low m n= 1 modes. In initial experiments, the control system has been capable of delaying the onset of RWMs in energetic discharges for several hundred milliseconds. The feedback control system consists of <b>detector</b> <b>coils</b> connected via control software to high power current amplifiers driving the excitation coils.

To address the sensitivity of NMR for mass-limited samples it is worthwhile to miniaturize this <b>detector</b> <b>coil.</b> Although making smaller coils seems a trivial step, the challenges {{in the design of}} microcoil probeheads are to get the highest possible sensitivity while maintaining high resolution and keeping the versatility to apply all known NMRexperiments. This means that the coils have to be optimized for a given sample geometry, circuit losses should be avoided, susceptibility broadening due to probe materials has to be minimized, and finally the B 1 -fields generated by the rf coils should be homogeneous over the sample volume. This contribution compares three designs that have been miniaturized for NMR detection: solenoid coils, flat helical coils, and the novel stripline and microslot designs.

40|$|Ultrasonic waves which {{propagate}} {{along the}} surface of a plate can be described by the Rayleigh-Lamb frequency equation. Considerable simplification of the theoretical analysis occurs when the plate thickness is either much greater or much smaller than the ultrasonic wavelengths. In the short wavelength case, ultrasound propagates as a non-dispersive, surface-travelling (Rayleigh) wave. When all the wavelength components are much greater than the plate thickness, the zero-order Lamb wave modes are the most prominent features. In this paper; we present the results of a series of experiments on aluminium plate samples, examining the transition between the two extremum forms as the plate thickness was decreased. The broad bandwidth (10 ns rise-time) surface-travelling waves were generated using a Nd:YAG laser. They were detected, 20 mm from the source, by broadband electromagnetic acoustic transducers (EMATs), sensitive either to the normal, or the tangential, velocity of the sample surface. On thin foils, the prominent antisymmetric zero-order Lamb mode is highly dispersive, the high-frequency components of the signal arriving first. Effects observed {{at the front of the}} signal seem to derive from the finite (1 mm) width of the <b>detector</b> <b>coil.</b> Hence, for comparison, a homodyne laser interferometer approximating to a point detector was also used. For aluminium plate with thickness greater than 6 mm, the non-dispersive Rayleigh wave was clearly distinguishable from the reverberating bulk waves.

On intermediate plates, the waveforms appeared inherently complicated, comprising an inextricable combination of bulk-reverberating and Lamb waves...|$|E
40|$|Imaging {{speed in}} {{conventional}} {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) {{is limited by the}} performance of magnetic field gradients and the rate of power deposition in tissue. Parallel MRI techniques overcome these constraints by exploiting information stored within the spatial sensitivity patterns of radiofrequency detector arrays to substitute for some of the spatial information that would normally be obtained using magnetic field gradients. Parallel MRI strategies have been applied clinically to increase patient comfort, enhance spatial resolution, expand anatomical coverage, and reduce image artifacts. The effectiveness of parallel MRI techniques is largely determined by the amount of spatial information that is stored in the <b>detector</b> <b>coil</b> sensitivities. This dissertation investigates the spatial encoding properties of coil arrays from three practical and fundamental perspectives. First, a novel array design is presented that enables spatial encoding in multiple directions simultaneously. Second, the impact of inductive coupling between array elements in parallel MRI is investigated theoretically and experimentally. Finally, electromagnetic calculations are described that permit computation of the ultimate intrinsic signal-to-noise ratio available to any physically realizable coil array for parallel MR. These calculations help to establish fundamental limits to the image accelerations that may be achieved using parallel MRI techniques. These limits are intrinsically related to the wavelengths of the electromagnetic fields at MR imaging frequencies. The sensitivity patterns that correspond to the ultimate intrinsic SNR also represent potential starting points for new coil designs. by Michael A. Ohliger. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Imaging {{speed is}} a crucial {{consideration}} for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The speed of conventional MRI is limited by hardware performance and physiological safety measures. "Parallel" MRI is a new technique that circumvents these limitations by utilizing arrays of radiofrequency <b>detector</b> <b>coils</b> to acquire data in parallel, thereby enabling still higher imaging speeds. In parallel MRI, coil arrays are used to accomplish part of the spatial encoding that was traditionally performed by magnetic field gradients alone. MR signal data acquired with coil arrays are spatially encoded with the distinct reception patterns of the individual coil elements. T[he quality of parallel MR images is dictated by the accuracy and efficiency of an image reconstruction (decoding) strategy. This thesis formulates the spatial encoding and decoding of parallel MRI as a generalized linear inverse problem. Under this linear algebraic framework, theoretical and empirical limits {{on the performance of}} parallel MR image reconstructions are characterized, and solutions are proposed to facilitate routine clinical and research applications. Each research study presented in this thesis addresses one or more elements in the inverse problem, and the studies are collectively arranged to reflect three progressive stages in solving the inverse problem: 1) determining the encoding matrix, 2) computing a matrix inverse, 3) characterizing the error involved. First, a self-calibrating strategy is proposed which uses non-Cartesian trajectories to automatically determine coil sensitivities without the need of an external scan or modification of data acquisition, guaranteeing an accurate formulation of the encoding matrix. (cont.) Second, two matrix inversion strategies are presented which, respectively, exploit physical properties of coil encoding and the phase information of the magnetization. While the former allows stable and distributable matrix inversion using the k-space locality principle, the latter integrates parallel image reconstruction with conjugate symmetry. Third, a numerical strategy is presented for computing noise statistics of parallel MRI techniques which involve magnitude image combination, enabling quantitative image comparison. In addition, fundamental limits on the performance of parallel image reconstruction are derived using the Cramer-Rao bounds. Lastly, the practical applications of techniques developed in this thesis are demonstrated by a case study in improved coronary angiography. Thesis (Ph. D.)

The principle {{and performance of}} the method was demonstrated by measuring the levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) present in urine. The test format was a sandwich assay using two distinct monoclonal antibodies directed against hCG. The first anti-hCG antibody was labeled with superparamagnetic particles whereas the second was immobilized as a narrow detection zone on a porous membrane. The human urine sample was mixed with superparamagnetic particles coated with the first anti-hCG antibody, and the mixture was allowed to migrate past the detection zone containing the second anti-hCG antibody. Capillary forces facilitated migration of the immune complexes along the porous membrane. The amount of superparamagnetic particle-labelled monoclonal anti-hCG bound to the detection zone was directly proportional {{to the amount of}} hCG present in the sample as detected by measuring magnetization in the <b>detector</b> <b>coil.</b> The method had a practical detection limit of 20 U/l (54 nM) of hCG per 5 &mu;l of human urine and a linear range of three decades from 20 U/l to 10 000 U/l.

The high filling factor obtained using this approach provides very high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and image quality, but the overall procedure is much less invasive than surgical intrabiliary MRI. In this thesis, two models are proposed. The first has a multi-turn spiral with integrated tuning and matching capacitors as a <b>detector</b> <b>coil,</b> and a photonic bandgap structure with a periodically patterned ground plane as a transmission line. Commercial electromagnetic modelling software (AWR Microwave Office) is used to perform a detailed analysis of a complete detector system. Coil and cable are both modelled using Axiem, a method of moments solver. Analysis of the reflection and transmission coefficient is used to extract parameters such as characteristic impedance and propagation loss. Parameters are chosen for operation at 63. 8 MHz (1 H MRI at 1. 5 T) with a 50 Ω system impedance. Because the first design was implemented without considering MR-safety, a second-generation system was developed. This design uses a figure-of-eight shaped coil used as a detector and also as the resonant element in a magneto-inductive transmission line.

An active vibration control system is hereby established to attenuate vibration by using laser displacement <b>detectors</b> and voice <b>coil</b> motors (VCMs). In this paper, we reveal that the vibration attenuation problem can be theoretically formulated as an output regulation problem subject to saturated actuation of VCMs. Within the formulation, a saturated output regulation algorithm is successfully implemented and its effectiveness is extensively examined by experiments...|$|R
25|$|MEG signals {{were first}} {{measured}} by University of Illinois physicist David Cohen in 1968, before {{the availability of}} the SQUID, using a copper induction <b>coil</b> as the <b>detector.</b> To reduce the magnetic background noise, the measurements were made in a magnetically shielded room. The <b>coil</b> <b>detector</b> was barely sensitive enough, resulting in poor, noisy MEG measurements that were difficult to use. Later, Cohen built a better shielded room at MIT, and used one of the first SQUID detectors, just developed by James E. Zimmerman, a researcher at Ford Motor Company, to again measure MEG signals. This time the signals were almost as clear as those of EEG. This stimulated the interest of physicists who had been looking for uses of SQUIDs. Subsequent to this, various types of spontaneous and evoked MEGs began to be measured.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method for a {{ubiquitous}} sensor to detect the position and direction on the Two-Dimensional Signal Transmission sheet (2 DST sheet), and conducts several basic experiments. First, we propose the algorithm to code the position information on the 2 DST sheet, and prove that the room-sized 2 DST sheet is covered by using this algorithm. Next, we perform simulations of the electromagnetic field modulation by the coding pattern, and confirm the vertical direction magnetic field is useful to detect the coding pattern because it is especially strong {{along the edge of}} the conductor pattern. Finally, we design a <b>coil</b> <b>detector</b> which sense this vertical-direction magnetic field and conducted the experiments. The results show that our method is useful for position detection on the 2 DST sheet...|$|R
