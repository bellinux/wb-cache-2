40|$|The {{world today}} faces many {{challenges}} {{in terms of}} sustainability and how {{the world will be}} able to continue to meet demands of future generations. Sustainability aspects are considered by customers and organizations to a greater extent today than ever before. Businesses need to find new ways forward to encourage sustainable consumption to be able to exist in the future. The increasing amount of food waste represents one of many sustainability challenges and is a stated problem in developed countries. In Sweden, the households stand for the biggest amount of food waste along the entire supply chain. Producing something that is later wasted is an inefficient use of resources. This study aims to identify barriers for consumers to act pro-environmentally when consuming products of low involvement and find ways for the industry to overcome them. The thesis is commissioned for a large bread company in Sweden, who is in the starting blocks of start selling <b>frozen</b> <b>bread,</b> something that is not done to a great extent today. <b>Frozen</b> <b>bread</b> is a more environmentally sustainable alternative than substitute products and it will serve as the low-involvement product in focus of this study. The theoretical framework is built on theories regarding consumer decision-making, consumer behavior, sustainability and sustainable consumption. Through in-store observations of customers accompanied by follow-up interviews, a solid amount of data was gathered which allowed the authors to address the gap between intentions and behavior. Semi-structured interviews with the manager of the grocery store and the commissioned company give insights to the industry perspective of sustainability and consumer behavior. The empirical findings are presented from each data collection instance and are later analyzed and discussed with regard to four sub-purposes and the theoretical framework. The results have shown that existing barriers relate to customers’ habits, inertia, attitudes and lack of knowledge. The industry has the opportunity to bring forward sustainable products without tradeoffs, to create a win-win situation. By appealing to the customers’ hedonic needs and informing them about environmental benefits it is possible to influence customer norms to achieve a pro-environmental behavioral change. ...|$|E

40|$|Ice {{crystals}} in <b>frozen</b> <b>bread</b> {{are substantially}} {{shaped by the}} complex pore structures of crumb. In this study we inspected the breadcrumb porosity of ice-filled pores from the profiles of ice crystals mapped by differential scanning calorimetry and nuclear magnetic resonance. Two types of wheat bread containing different amounts of dietary fiber and sugar were studied after frozen storage at - 18 A degrees C for 3 weeks. Both pore sizes and pore size distributions were derived via comparing the measurements to those of water-saturated mesoporous silica (MCM- 41 C 18) with a well-defined pore size distribution. Good consistency was shown for the crumb pore structures obtained using the two techniques. Both bread types featured broad nanometer ranges of pore sizes characterized with largely bimodal size distributions. Besides, the frozen high-fiber bread displayed {{a higher proportion of}} large pores and a broader pore size distribution than the high-sugar bread. By comparing such pore size distributions with those obtained previously for the corresponding fresh bread, it can be concluded that structural differences between the two bread types were produced during the frozen storage, manifesting the disparate freezing performances of bread with different formulations...|$|E
40|$|The storage {{stability}} of unproved lean yeasted <b>frozen</b> <b>bread</b> dough was studied using test baking, physical dough testing, protein analysis and microscopy techniques. Doughs {{with and without}} yeast were prepared according to commercial procedures and stored at - 10 'C, - 20 'C, - 30 'C or under cycling temperatures (between - 10 and - 20 'C) for periods between 1 day and 20 weeks. Test baking results showed that loaf quality (loaf volume and total loaf score) gradually decreased with storage time. Doughs stored at - 1 ooc had higher loaf volumes than doughs stored at - 20 or - 30 'C, but had a poorer appearance and a lower total loaf score. Test baking could not explain the reason for quality loss. However, it established appropriate storage treatments (temperature and time) for other tests aimed at determining the cause of dough deterioration, such as loss of yeast viability, ice recrystallization, or other factors. Physical changes in frozen dough were investigated using a modified Extensograph test. Dough strength was affected by time and storage at - 10 'C or by cycling temperatures.

This study intended to develop a formulation of <b>frozen</b> <b>bread</b> in advanced stages of cooking, left a few minutes in the microwave, it is presented to the consumer as freshly baked. Cooking with microwave technology presents problems that can be overcome with technological adjuvants or enhancers. The enhancer used in the baking test samples was the Fermaid® MW, developed by Lallemand Baking Solutions Boulangerie, DK, in order to provide a good dough stability and good texture of the final product. The Fermaid® MW incorporation and the cooking time period in micro-waves, were determined by the Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The studied samples, were cooked in the micro-wave oven, involved in a semi-discontinued aluminum susceptor, a special packaged with the intention that the cooking could be made from the outside {{to the inside of the}} bread, inducing the browning of the bread crust. After cooking, the samples were cooled for 5 minutes and the hardness of both the crust and the crumb were analyzed by penetration and compression tests and Texture Profile Analysis (TPA), carried out in the texturómeter. The results were not very conclusive, because the variability of the samples was very high and the susceptor applied did not work as intended, but it was clear that the presence of the enhancer decreased the hardness of the breads, however the formulation that was closer to standard values was the formulation of the central point of the experimental design, with concentration of 1. 5 % Fermaid® MW and 6 minute heating in microwave oven, with a mean weight of 68. 9 g...|$|E

From 1998 to 2010, ten outbreaks implicated undercooked not-ready-to-eat entrées. In each outbreak, affected individuals prepared entrées in a microwave oven, did not follow recommended cooking instructions, and failed to take the internal temperature of the cooked product. This dissertation surveyed grocery stores for product availability, evaluated consumers’ preparation practices of raw, <b>breaded,</b> <b>frozen</b> chicken entrées, and validated on-package label instructions. The survey of retail revealed that several manufacturers fail to provide consumers clear preparation instructions. A video capture system was used to observe food preparation practices of 41 consumers– 21 primary meal preparers and 20 adolescents–in a mock domestic kitchen using uncooked, <b>frozen,</b> <b>breaded</b> chicken products, and determined if differences exist between consumers’ reported safe food handling practices and actual food handling behavior as prescribed on product labels. Differences between self-report and observed food safety behaviors were identified between groups. Many participants reported owning a food thermometer (73 percent) and reported using one when cooking raw, breaded chicken entrées (19. 5 percent); however, only five participants (12. 2 percent) were observed measuring the final internal temperature with a food thermometer despite instructions on the product packaging to do so. Food handling errors identified during the meal preparation sessions were then mimicked in a controlled laboratory setting to determine the impact of such deviations on end-product temperature. For all products, highly variable internal temperatures were recorded across entrées when prepared in a 600 W microwave oven. Microwave cooking of raw breaded poultry products is unpredictable in achieving uniform target end-point temperatures; however, a 1000 W microwave oven consistently produced a safe end product. Data collected through direct observation more accurately reflected consumer food handling behaviors than data collected through self-reported surveys. Low wattage microwave ovens failed to produce a safe end product. Processors should validate instructions for not-ready-eat entrées using a range of microwave ovens rather than a single wattage, develop a unique set of instructions for entrées, and provide consumers clear cooking instructions that result in a safe end product...|$|R
