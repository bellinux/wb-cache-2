500|$|DR's Per Juul Carlsen {{declared}} {{that although the}} film is visually beautiful, he is not sure it should be this way: [...] "Had it not been better and more correct {{to tell the story}} really ugly and blurry in the rain instead of sunshine... with realism instead of polished exquisiteness". He also criticized it for sharing too much of the American gangster and spy film clichés. The most critical review was done by Georg Metz of Dagbladet Information, who criticized its historicity and thought the characters were psychologically underdeveloped and uninteresting. Metz wrote, [...] "The nicest [...] one can say about this film, if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>nice,</b> is that it celebrates the naïve view of history" [...] and described it as [...] " [...] neo-nationalistic panopticon of predominantly cardboard figures that will be suitable for evening entertainment for the Danish People's Party and the Liberal Party congresses. Quite apart from that {{about a third of the}} dialogue is hard to understand, because the players do not articulate appropriately." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviews of Bookends {{upon its}} release in 1968 were largely positive. Allen Evans of the British {{publication}} New Musical Express (NME) gave the record {{four out of}} five stars and called it [...] "inspiring, descriptive music," [...] while noting the album is [...] "Imaginative and at times confusing to know what the composer is getting at, if anything." [...] Rival newspaper Melody Maker did not use a ratings system, but called Bookends a [...] "thoughtful, clever and well-produced album." [...] Reviewer Chris Welch criticized the songs as [...] "not particularly tuneful," [...] but performed with [...] "Beatles fervour and Beatles conviction," [...] praising the lyricism, opining that [...] "The words capture part of America today, a lot of its sickness and tragedy." [...] In the US, Rolling Stone reviewer Arthur Schmidt wrote that [...] "The music is, for me, questionable, but I've always found their music questionable. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>nice</b> enough, and I admit to liking it, but it exudes a sense of process, and it is slick, and nothing too much happens." ...|$|E
500|$|Kapoor {{followed}} her success in Bodyguard and Ra.One with {{a role in}} Shakun Batra's directorial debut Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu (2012) opposite Imran Khan. Set in Las Vegas, the romantic comedy follows {{the story of two}} strangers who get married one night after getting drunk. She played Riana Braganza, a carefree young woman, and was particularly drawn to the qualities of her character: [...] "Riana knows what she is doing. Even though she does not have a house or a job, she is a positive person [...] very similar to the way I am." [...] The film received positive reviews and was an economic success, grossing a total of [...] in India and abroad. The Hollywood Reporter found her [...] "endearingly natural"; Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com asserted that [...] "after doing ornamental roles in films like Bodyguard and Ra.One, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>nice</b> to see the spunky actress in her element again since Jab We Met." [...] She next appeared in Agent Vinod, an espionage thriller directed by Sriram Raghavan. Kapoor was enthusiastic about the project, but it met with a tepid response and she was described as miscast. When asked why she had taken the role, Kapoor described it as an opportunity to attempt something she had never done before.|$|E
500|$|Burton {{insisted that}} the film be bloody, as he felt stage {{versions}} of the play which {{cut back on the}} bloodshed robbed it of its power. For him, [...] "Everything is so internal with Sweeney that [...] is like his emotional release. It's more about catharsis than it is a literal thing." [...] Producer Richard D. Zanuck said that [...] " [...] had a very clear plan that he wanted to lift that up into a surreal, almost Kill Bill kind of stylization. We had done tests and experiments with the neck slashing, with the blood popping out. I remember saying to Tim, 'My God, do we dare do this?'" [...] On set, the fake blood was colored orange to render correctly on the desaturated color film used, and crew members wore bin liners to avoid getting stained while filming. This macabre tone made some studios nervous, and it was not until Warner Bros., DreamWorks and Paramount had signed up for the project that the film's $50 million budget was covered. Burton said [...] "the studio was cool about it and they accepted it because they knew what the show was. Any movie is a risk, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>nice</b> {{to be able to do}} something like that that doesn't fit into the musical or slasher movie categories." ...|$|E

500|$|Contemporary reviews were mixed. Chris Welch of Melody Maker {{praised the}} musicianship {{of the band}} and Anderson's flute playing, writing also that [...] "the joke {{at the expense of}} a local {{newspaper}} wears thin rather rapidly, but should not detract from the obvious amount of thought and work that has gone into the production of Thick"; he described the music as a creative effort where [...] "the ideas flow in super abundance" [...] but that [...] "needs time to absorb" [...] and [...] "heard out of context of their highly visual stage act... does not have such immediate appeal". Tony Tyler in his review for New Musical Express generally appreciated the construction of the suites and the arrangements, but he had doubts about the album's possible success. He called Thick as a Brick [...] "Jethro Tull's own stand-or-fall epic after the lines of Tommy" [...] and [...] "an assault on the mediocrity and harshness of lower-middle-class existence in '70s Britain". Ben Gerson in Rolling Stone magazine called Thick as a Brick [...] "one of rock's most sophisticated and ground-breaking products". Going further, the reviewer stated: [...] "Martin Barre's guitar and John Evan's keyboards especially shine, and Ian's singing is no longer abrasive. Whether or not Thick As A Brick is an isolated experiment, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>nice</b> to know that someone in rock has ambitions beyond the four- or five-minute conventional track, and has the intelligence to carry out his intentions, in all their intricacy, with considerable grace." [...] Rolling Stones Dave Marsh gave it 2 out of 5 stars in The Rolling Stone Record Guide, judging it had [...] "relatively undifferentiated movements". American critic Robert Christgau disliked the album, calling it [...] "the usual shit: rock (getting heavier), folk (getting feyer), classical (getting schlockier), flute (getting better because it has no choice)".|$|E

2500|$|In a 2000 {{interview}} with the Sunday Mirror Taylforth commented further on her decision to leave the serial: [...] "I left EastEnders because after 13 years I felt I really needed a break. I wanted {{to do other things}} and I knew I wasn't getting any younger. But throughout everything that has happened in my life I have had tremendous support from the people in EastEnders. I love them so dearly. I still keep in touch with some of them, and my line when I left the show was, 'I won't say goodbye, just au revoir', and that is how I feel. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>nice</b> that they have left the door open for Kathy to return." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{live for}} today, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>nice</b> {{sometimes}} {{to look back}} to yesterday. We {{did not know that}} we were living through an era - the Big Band Era - that would last only 10 years or so and be remembered and revered for ever...it's hard to believe, but the best times were packed into a five-year period from the late 1930s through the early 1940s when I sang with the bands of Artie Shaw, Benny Goodman, and Harry James. The most dramatic moments of my life were crammed into a couple of years from the fall of 1941 to the end of 1943. They seem to symbolize my life...that was when the music of the dance bands was the most popular music in the country, and I was the most popular female band singer in the country and Harry had the most popular band in the country. It didn't last long, but it sure was something while it lasted. Everyone should have something like it at least once in their lives. I'm grateful I did." [...] - Helen Forrest (circa 1982) ...|$|E
2500|$|Pop Justice praised Scherzinger's {{choice to}} release [...] "Don't Hold Your Breath" [...] as her second single. They said [...] "For the {{follow-up}} [...] Nicole {{has taken the}} controversial move of recording a song that is also basically brilliant... <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>nice</b> to have a decent song about love because love is the official topic of pop and anyone who tries to tell you otherwise is a fool to themselves and {{needs to have a}} long sit down." [...] A review from Rap-Up agreed saying that on [...] "Don't Hold Your Breath", Scherzinger takes it the club with the [...] "empowering pop jam" [...] and declares her independence. Robbie Daw from Idolator praised the song, based just on its demo. He said [...] "Well, okay—we will allow that this song already sounds better than every Pussycat Dolls single combined." [...] Robert Copsey from Digital Spy praised the song awarding it five out of five stars. In his review, Copsey said [...] "That said, we found ourselves mildly red-faced on a recent excursion while listening to Nicole Scherzinger's latest chart assault... Who could blame us though?" [...] He went on the praise the Gloria Gaynor-like conviction displayed by Scherzinger as well as the song's overall production. Ben Norman from About.com, in a review for Killer Love said that, [...] "'Don't Hold Your Breath' is an absolute standout {{and one of the best}} tracks she has offered in any association she's had. Bradley Stern of MTV Buzzworthy described the song's production as [...] "gorgeous". In July 2013, The Huffington Post ranked [...] "Don't Hold Your Breath" [...] at number 23 on its list of the top 50 number ones of the last ten years. Cosmopolitan listed the song at number 9 on the magazine's [...] "Best Breakup Songs". The article also included [...] "I Don't Need a Man" [...] at number two which Scherzinger wrote for her former girl group, The Pussycat Dolls. BecomeGorgeous.com acknowledged the song as one of the best break up songs for girls saying, [...] "Nicole Scherzinger truly understands what you're going through and suggests a pretty good line to address your ex when he thinks you're coming home to make up: Don't Hold Your Breath." ...|$|E
