40|$|Before the 1970 s, {{registers}} {{were primarily}} used for individual reference, for which purpose paper registers are quite adequate. The first <b>electronic</b> <b>registers</b> rationalised {{the collection and}} availability of information and improved the possibilities of collecting statistics. In the 1970 s, advanced statistics and prognoses were prerequisites for centralised social planning. From 1979 onwards, law regulated the use of <b>electronic</b> <b>registers.</b> This prevented the misuse of personal information concerning individuals. In the 1980 s, processes and results {{that had previously been}} viewed as immeasurable, became better defined and were becoming measurable. At the same time as <b>electronic</b> <b>registers</b> were adapting to their new functions, they were still being used for individual references. The study includes four case studies, each illustrating distinctive features in the history of <b>electronic</b> <b>registers.</b> With the registration of university students’ examinations, the Ministry was able to build up a result-orientated basis for the distribution of funds to the university, that is, the new register met new political needs. Establishing the Central Civil Registration meant that every citizen was given his/her own number which was used as an identi­fier in any state register concerning the citizens. Hence, pieces of information in different <b>electronic</b> <b>registers</b> could be combined. The <b>Electronic</b> Aliens <b>Register</b> replaced a huge paper register and made access to the register much easier for regional and state authorities than it had been previously. And finally, municipal autonomy made it difficult to establish the National Patient Registry. Local registers that referred to common guidelines had to be accepted in order for the registry to become functional...|$|R

U radu se prikazuje uloga javnih bilježnika u razvoju elektroničkog pravnog prometa i naglašava njihova nužna povezanost sa suvremenim oblicima elektroničke komunikacije. Kao ključni problemi obrađuju se elektronička ovjera, elektronički registar skrbništva i elektronički arhiv isprava te daju prijedlozi za preuzimanje odgovarajućih rješenja u Republici Hrvatskoj. Participation of notaries {{public in}} {{electronic}} legal transaction {{is present in}} various aspects of their activity - <b>electronic</b> authentication, <b>electronic</b> <b>registers</b> and archiving of electronic documents. The author compares the regulation {{of the role of}} notaries public in electronic legal transactions in German, Austrian and Croatian law with regard to their similarities and differences, and points to the need to regulate certain unregulated issues in Croatian law. The inadequate regulation of electronic authentication, dealt with only in the Court Register Act, is far from sufficient for the development of this useful manner of authenticating electronic documents, so the author stresses the need for more specific rules. Considering the selected line of development, which follows the German legal tradition, the idea of electronic authentication should follow the premise that electronic signature reflects both the notary 2 ̆ 7 s capacity and signature. The unquestionable significance of guardian proxy <b>registers,</b> as unique <b>electronic</b> systems managed by central notarial chambers in Germany and Austria, should encourage the establishment of similar registers in Croatia. The benefits would be manifold - citizens could select a guardian {{to take care of them}} in the event of their incapacity, thus preventing procedures which may arise in the appointment of guardians. Experience of Croatian notaries public with <b>electronic</b> <b>registers</b> could be of great value in the setting up of the above mentioned registers. Finally, the legal obligation for <b>electronic</b> <b>registers</b> to archive data could serve as the basis of the setting up of a unique archiving system in which documents could be stored and revoked, in line with the solutions found in Austrian law...|$|R

Now that it has received the PMO approval, it will be put up before the Union Cabinet and will finally be introduced in Parliament for its final nod, sources said. The NCHRH is proposed to be established by the health ministry as an overarching regulatory authority in the country to reform the current regulatory framework in medical education and enhance the supply of skilled personnel to the healthcare sector in the country. Once in place, the NCHRH will be the overarching regulatory body for all the premier medical educational institutions and autonomous regulatory bodies like Medical Council of India (MCI), Pharmacy Council of India (PCI), Nursing Council of India (NCI), Dental Council of India (DCI) and the proposed Central Councils for Paramedical and Allied Medical Sciences Education. It will prescribe standards with a view to have proper planning and co-coordinated development of medical and allied health education throughout the country and maintain national live <b>electronic</b> <b>register</b> of medical and allied health professionals. The expert group of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the task force of the Ministry of Human Resource Development (HRD) broadly agreed to settle their turf war over the jurisdiction of medical education. The National Commission for Human Resources in Health (NCHRH) will get tolay down the minimum standards of medical education, while all health-related research will comeunder the purview of the National Commission for Higher Education and Research (NCHER), promoted by the HRD Ministry. The NCHRH and the NCHER draft Bills — proposed as regulatory bodies — have been pending for the past several months as the two ministries were involved in a tussle over the jurisdiction of medical education As per the draft bill, the administration of the Council will consist of a Secretariat headed by a Secretary-General who will be appointed by the Council for a fixed term of three years. Under this secretariat, seven departments, each for separate categories like Medicine, Pharmacy, Nursing, Dentistry, Rehabilitation & Physiotherapy, Public Health & Hospital Management and Allied Health Sciences, will be established and headed by a director for regulatory purposes. In every state, there will be separate bodies constituted by the Council for each administrative department which will be known as Registration and Ethics Board with name of the state in front and the department's name in the end. These bodies will replace the existing State Councils. These boards have to maintain a live <b>electronic</b> <b>register</b> of professionals {{in the state of the}} respective Department to be known as 'State Register of (name of the Department) and which will be linked to the National Register of Human Resources in Health maintained by the Council. Each Board will comprise a president, a vice-president and not less than 10 members out of which three will be women candidates. There will be a nominee of the state government also.|$|E
