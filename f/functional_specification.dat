500|$|Davies {{wanted a}} {{building}} [...] "to capture {{the imagination of}} the Welsh people." [...] The criteria of the competition was that the building should have a <b>functional</b> <b>specification</b> and a price tag of no more than £12M including fees. In total, 55 architects had shown interest in the project, nine came from Wales, 38 coming {{from the rest of the}} UK and the remaining eight from the rest of the world. The Design Competition Advisory Panel selected 12 architects for interview in August 1998, from those a shortlist of six architects were chosen to submit concept designs, they were: Benson & Forsyth, Eric Parry Associates, Niels Torp and Stride Treglown Davies, Richard Rogers Partnership (now known as Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners), Itsuko Hasegawa Atelier and Kajima Design Europe, and MacCormac Jamieson Prichard.|$|E

5000|$|When {{the team}} agrees that <b>functional</b> <b>specification</b> {{consensus}} is reached, the functional spec is typically declared [...] "complete" [...] or [...] "signed off". After this, typically the software development and testing team write source code and test cases using the <b>functional</b> <b>specification</b> as the reference.

40|$|Design is an {{important}} but little understood intelligent activity. Conceptual design is the transformation of <b>functional</b> <b>specifications</b> to an initial concept of an artifact that achieves them. Human designers rely heavily {{on the use of}} sketches, which {{can be thought of as}} qualitative models of a device. An appealing model of conceptual design is that of a mapping from qualitative <b>functional</b> <b>specifications</b> to a corresponding qualitative object model...|$|R
40|$|<b>Functional</b> <b>specifications</b> {{have been}} used to specify and verify designs of a number of reactive, {{discrete}} systems. In this paper we extend this specification style to deal with real-time and hybrid systems. As mathematical foundation we employ Banach's fixed point theory in metric spaces. The goal is to show that the theory used for discrete <b>functional</b> <b>specifications</b> smoothly carries over to real-time and hybrid systems. An example of a thermostat specification illustrates the method...|$|R

40|$|Testing is a {{standard}} method of assuring that software performs as intended. In this paper, we extend the category-partition method, which is a specification-based testing method. An important aspect of category-partition testing is the construction of test specifications as an intermediate between <b>functional</b> <b>specifications</b> and actual tests. We define a minimal coverage criterion for category-partition test specifications, identify a mechanical process to produce a test specification that satis es the criterion, and discuss the problem of resolving infeasible combinations of choices for categories. Our method uses formal schema-based <b>functional</b> <b>specifications</b> and is shown to be feasible with an example study of a simple file system...|$|R

40|$|Software {{correctness}} {{is usually}} {{viewed as a}} relationship between specification and implementation, but our analysis of colloquial usage shows that a third process, certification, {{plays a key role}} in establishing correctness. Just as poorly implemented systems can be untestable, so too badly specified systems can be difficult to test. Certification can be viewed as a set of industrial standards for <b>functional</b> <b>specifications,</b> where failure to meet these standards renders <b>functional</b> <b>specifications</b> unacceptable from a testability point of view. Moreover, even though certification addresses issues in testability, it is the responsibility not of the test crew but of the specification team. We provide examples to motivate our observations on specification technique, and conclude by demonstrating the existence of uncertifiable systems...|$|R
