Also examined is {{the question of}} whether joint Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries have a more difficult time being placed than do other patients. The principal conclusions are first, that the nursing home bed supply and the type of Medicaid payment system affect the ability of hospitals to discharge patients to nursing homes. Joint Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries have a more difficult time being placed in nursing homes in States with fewer beds and more restrictive Medicaid payment policies, and <b>joint</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> do not appear to have longer stays in hospitals. Rather, they have a greater likelihood of being discharged to home...|$|R

For example, {{a person with a}} hallux rigidus (stiff big toe) may use a rocker bottom shoe to replace the flexion lost at the metatarsal joint. Rocker bottom shoes are also used to compensate for the lost range of motion, however caused, at the tibiotalar joint (ankle joint). In such cases, the wearer maintains solid and stable footing while standing, but the rock of the heel assists with the propulsive phase of gait, making walking more natural and less painful to the affected <b>joints.</b> <b>Beneficiaries</b> of this type of sole modification include people suffering from arthritis or any other disorder or injury causing pain and/or loss of motion in foot joints.|$|R
40|$|International audienceEffective sharing {{mechanisms}} of <b>joint</b> costs among <b>beneficiaries</b> {{of a project}} are a fundamental requirement for the sustainability of the project. Projects that are heterogeneous {{both in terms of}} the landscape of the area under development or the participants (users) lead to a more complicated set of allocation mechanisms than homogeneous projects. The analysis presented in this paper uses cooperative game theory to develop schemes for sharing costs and revenues from a project involving various beneficiaries in an equitable and fair way. The proposed approach is applied to the West Delta irrigation project. It sketches a differential two-part tariff that reproduces the allocation of total project costs using the Shapley Value, a well-known cooperative game allocation solution. The proposed differential tariff, applied to each land section in the project reflecting their landscape-related costs, contrasts the unified tariff that was proposed using the traditional methods in the project planning documents...|$|R

In addition, by strengthening mental flexibility (Bauer-Wu 2010) and consciousness in decision-making (Nash and Newberg 2013), meditation influences individual decision-making styles (McNaughton 2003). In addition, meditation plays a stewardship role 2 to improve individual decisions without disciplining the individualâ€™s mind and emotions to align {{objectives of the}} last will, power of attorney, <b>beneficiaries,</b> <b>joint</b> tenancy, and appointment of a trustee with the personal interests of the estate holder. Thus, meditation is among the important factors {{that can lead to}} sound estate planning decisions of individuals related to the distribution of assets among family members and society for noble causes; therefore, this study concentrates on the relationship between meditation and the estate planning decisions of individuals with the aim of answering the following research question.|$|R
