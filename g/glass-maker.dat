In the same year, he {{returned}} to Reval where his stepfather, the <b>glass-maker</b> Diderick van Katwijk had seized his parents' houses, as Michael's mother had died in 1501. Van Katwijk had journeyed to Brabant in 1501 and offered a property settlement to Sittow that the latter refused. As the local court did not support Sittow's claim for inheritance, {{he had to go}} to the Court of Higher Instance in Lübeck. He won the case in Lübeck, but could not officially register his parents' houses as his property until the death of his stepfather in 1518.|$|E
6000|$|I daresay I {{thought the}} rough manners of a cheap school, as my {{grandfather}} Yeats had {{those of a}} chance companion, typical of all England. At any rate I had a harassed life & got many a black eye and had many outbursts of grief and rage. Once a boy, {{the son of a}} great Bohemian <b>glass-maker,</b> and who was older than the rest of us, and had been sent out of his country because of a love affair, beat a boy for me because we were [...] "both foreigners." [...] And a boy, who grew to be the school athlete and my chief friend, beat a great many. His are the face and name that I remember--his name was of Huguenot origin and his face like his gaunt and lithe body had something of the American Indian in colour and lineament.|$|E

50|$|Broad {{sheet glass}} was first {{made in the}} UK in Sussex in 1226. This glass was of poor quality and fairly opaque. Manufacture slowly {{decreased}} and ceased by the early 16th century. French <b>glass-makers</b> and others were making broad sheet glass earlier than this.|$|R

5000|$|Conditioned by the gusto of {{recovery}} and revival which had decreed {{the nineteenth century}} re-launching, modern glass-making on Murano was born relatively late on, that is, {{in the first years}} of the century while it gave original results only in the second decade at the time when the great foreign Art Nouveau <b>glass-makers</b> had already given their best works.|$|R

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, new stained glass was made to replace that which had been damaged. The artist Francisco Sánchez Martínez (one of the last <b>glass-makers</b> of the cathedral) was one of the better restorers, even though no new designs were produced and the old motifs were repeated. During the Spanish Civil War the glass deteriorated badly, but in the latter years of the 20th century a great restoration effort was undertaken and some of the brilliance of former periods was revived.|$|R
50|$|The modern {{furniture}} {{market was}} covered almost completely by Swedish production {{for the whole}} of the 1950s. The rationalists produced furnishing objects which were practical and simple, even programmatically modest. The rationalist instances were generally ignored in Murano, while the attempt was made to stylistically renew the product. In this way the <b>glass-makers,</b> exploiting traditional manual techniques, shaped vases in elementary forms, often square, in bright and provocative colors, with schematic motifs, sometimes geometrical whilst others were inspired by abstract painting. This was an exasperated and provocative affirmation of modernity which, shortly after, would be resolved in more meditated ways.|$|R

50|$|During {{the latter}} part of the 18th century, the monarchy slowly extricated itself from Belém-Ajuda. In 1794, a fire in Ajuda {{destroyed}} the 'Royal Tent' (Tenda Real), forcing the royal family to abandon the location and take residence in the Queluz National Palace. A lack of funds had delayed completion of the Ajuda National Palace, so with the French Invasion in 1807, the royal family fled to Rio de Janeiro. When they returned to Portugal in 1821, King John VI installed them in the Necessidades and Bemposta Palaces. Belém gradually evolved into an industrial zone, particularly around Pedrouços and Bom Sucesso, attracting factories of various kinds such as tanneries, metal-stampers, <b>glass-makers,</b> earthenware manufacturers, textile-makers and woollenware producers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{dichroic}} {{effect is}} achieved by making the glass with tiny proportions of nanoparticles of gold and silver dispersed in colloidal form throughout the glass material. The process used remains unclear, {{and it is likely}} that it was not well understood or controlled by the makers, and was probably discovered by accidental [...] "contamination" [...] with minutely ground gold and silver dust. The <b>glass-makers</b> may not even have known that gold was involved, as the quantities involved are so tiny; they may have come from a small proportion of gold in any silver added (most Roman silver contains small proportions of gold), or from traces of gold or gold leaf left by accident in the workshop from other work. The very few other surviving fragments of Roman dichroic glass vary considerably in their two colours.|$|R
6000|$|The first mirrors {{used were}} of {{polished}} metal, and for ages nobody knew of anything better. But {{there came a}} time when the idea entered the mind of man that [...] "glass lined with a sheet of metal will give back the image presented to it," [...] for these are the exact words of a writer who lived four centuries before Christ. And you may be sure that <b>glass-makers</b> took advantage of this suggestion, if they had not already found out the fact for themselves. So we know that the ancients did make glass mirrors. It is matter of history that looking-glasses were made in the first century of the Christian era, but whether quicksilver was poured upon the back, as it is now, or whether some other metal was used, we do not know.|$|R
5000|$|Then the refined mixture was taken, {{heated and}} shaped into blocks called frit. The frit was then taken and {{remelted}} and skimmed {{once again in}} order to remove impurities. The batch then had manganese added to the mixture at this time. The addition of manganese helps to rid the cristallo of any color tints. This step is repeated until the <b>glass-maker</b> is satisfied.|$|E
50|$|The {{expansion}} of this <b>glass-maker</b> family over many European countries is unparalleled. Its hut master dynasties made glass history in Bohemia, Silesia, Austria, Tyrol and Slovenia. Its glass-makers proved their artistic skills and technological experience in Brandenburg, Saxony, Thuringia, Bavaria, Styria, Slovakia, Croatia and so on. The well-known glass artist Friedrich Egermann also {{ranked among the}} family’s descendants as the natural historian and explorer of South America Thaddäus Haenke.|$|E
50|$|A legend {{says that}} the first known faceted glass was given as a present to Tsar Peter the Great from a <b>glass-maker</b> called Yefim Smolin, living in Vladimir Oblast. He boasted to Tsar that his glass couldn't be broken. Tsar Peter liked the present, however, after {{drinking}} some alcoholic beverage from it, he said loudly Let the glass be! (Стакану быть! - literally the glass be), threw the glass {{on the ground and}} managed to break it. But Peter didn't punish the <b>glass-maker,</b> and the production of such glasses continued. According to the legend, people present during this episode misinterpreted the Tsar's words and thought that Peter called to break the glasses (Стаканы бить! - literally beat glasses or break glasses), that's how a tradition of breaking drinkware on certain occasions appeared in Russia. Glasses were broken after especially important toasts or just during the especially cheerful parties. Russian restaurants even held a special prices for breaking the glasses. Breaking of drinkware, or, in wider context, any tableware, is believed in Russia to bring luck and happiness.|$|E
50|$|The Germanic {{peoples of}} the Migration period imitated glass {{drinking}} horns from Roman models.One fine 5th century Merovingian example found at Bingerbrück, Rhineland-Palatinate made from olive green glass is kept at the British Museum.Some of {{the skills of the}} Roman <b>glass-makers</b> survived in Lombardic Italy, exemplified by a blue glass drinking-horn from Sutri, also in the British Museum.The two Gallehus Horns (early 5th century), made from some 3 kg of gold and electrum each, are usually interpreted as drinking horns, although some scholars point out that it cannot be ruled out that they may have been intended as blowing horns. After the discovery of the first of these horns in 1639, Christian IV of Denmark by 1641 did refurbish it into a usable drinking horn, adding a rim, extending its narrow end and closing it up with a screw-on pommel. These horns are the most spectacular known specimens of Germanic Iron Age drinking horns, but they were lost in 1802 and are now only known from 17th to 18th century drawings.|$|R
60|$|I {{have told}} you how the Venetians kept glass-making a secret, and how, at last, the Germans learned it, and then the French, and their work came to be better liked {{than that of the}} Venetians. But these last still managed to keep the process of making mirrors a {{profound}} secret, and the French were determined to get at the mystery. Several young <b>glass-makers</b> went from France to Venice, and applied to all the looking-glass makers of Venice for situations as workmen, that they might learn the art. But all positively refused to receive them, and kept their doors and windows tightly closed while they were at work, that no one might see what they did. The young Frenchmen took advantage of this, and climbed up on the roofs, and cautiously made holes through which they could look; and thus they learned the carefully-kept secret, and went back to France and commenced the manufacture of glass mirrors. Twenty years after, a Frenchman invented founding glass, which gave France such a great advantage that the trade of Venice in looking-glasses was ruined.|$|R
2500|$|Contrary to {{legend and}} popular belief, Dom Pérignon did not invent {{sparkling}} wine, {{though he did}} make important contributions to the production and quality of both still and sparkling Champagne wines. The oldest recorded sparkling wine is Blanquette de Limoux, which was apparently invented by Benedictine Monks in the Abbey of Saint-Hilaire, near Carcassonne in 1531. They achieved this by bottling the wine before the initial fermentation had ended. Over a century later, the English scientist and physician Christopher Merret documented the addition of sugar to a finished wine to create a second fermentation, six years before Dom Pérignon {{set foot in the}} Abbey of Hautvillers and almost 40 years before it was claimed that the famed Benedictine monk invented Champagne. Merret presented a paper at the Royal Society, in which he detailed what is now called , in 1662. Merret's discoveries coincided also with English glass-makers' technical developments that allowed bottles to be produced that could withstand the required internal pressures during secondary fermentation. French <b>glass-makers</b> at this time could not produce bottles of the required quality or strength. As early as 1663 the poet Samuel Butler referred to [...] "brisk champagne".|$|R
