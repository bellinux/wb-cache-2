25|$|After the Karnaugh map {{has been}} constructed, {{it is used}} to find one of the {{simplest}} possible forms — a canonical form — for the information <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> table. Adjacent 1s in the Karnaugh map represent opportunities to simplify the expression. The minterms ('minimal terms') for the final expression are found by encircling groups of 1s in the map. Minterm groups must be rectangular and must have an area that is a power of two (i.e., 1,2,4,8…). Minterm rectangles should be as large as possible without containing any 0s. Groups may overlap in order to make each one larger. The optimal groupings in the example below are marked by the green, red and blue lines, and the red and green groups overlap. The red group is a 2×2 square, the green group is a 4×1 rectangle, and the overlap area is indicated in brown.|$|E

500|$|Kant's Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten (1785) expounded a moral {{system based}} on the {{categorical}} imperative, one formulation of which is: [...] "Act only according to that maxim through which you can {{at the same time}} will that it become a universal law." [...] Rational agents must act on [...] "principles of pure rational agency," [...] writes Moore; that is, principles that regulate all rational agents. But Williams distinguished between thinking and acting. To think rationally is to think in a way compatible with belief <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth,</b> and [...] "what is takes for one to believe the truth is the same as what it takes for anyone else to believe the truth," [...] writes Moore. But one can act rationally by satisfying one's own desires (internal reasons for action), and what it takes to do that may not be what it takes for anyone else to satisfy theirs. Kant's approach to treating thinking and acting alike is wrong, according to Williams.|$|E

500|$|The {{libretto}} {{was written}} by the court poet, Salomon Franck, and published in [...] in 1715. The opening refers to Jesus' words in John 3:5: [...] "Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." [...] (...) The second movement, a recitative, reflects upon birth in the Spirit as baptism through God's grace: [...] "" [...] (In the bath of spirit and water he becomes a child of blessedness and grace). Movement 3, an aria for alto, considers that the bond has to be renewed throughout life, {{because it will be}} broken by man, reflected in movement 4.

500|$|Rutherford's {{confrontation}} with four Watch Tower Society directors who opposed him in 1917 highlighted both the forcefulness {{of his personality}} and his determination to fight for what he believed was right. Penton claims Rutherford played [...] "hard-fisted church politics" [...] and Rogerson accuses Rutherford of using The Watchtower as a propaganda medium to attack his opposers in what was effectively a battle for his position as president. At {{the heart of his}} opponents' complaints was his [...] "autocratic" [...] behavior as he strove to [...] "exercise complete management of the Society and its affairs." [...] Penton similarly describes Rutherford's actions in his first year of presidency—including his appointment of new directors, refusal to allow the Society's accounts to be examined, and his unilateral decision to publish The Finished Mystery—as high-handed and secretive. In contrast, Rutherford claimed, [...] "It was my duty to use the power the Lord had put into my hands to support the interests of the shareholders and all others interested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Truth</b> throughout the world ... to be unfaithful to them would be unfaithful to the Lord." [...] Macmillan, who supported Rutherford throughout the crisis, claimed the president was extremely patient and [...] "did everything that he could to help his opposers see their mistake, holding a number of meetings with them, trying to reason with them and show them how contrary their course was to the Society's charter".|$|E
