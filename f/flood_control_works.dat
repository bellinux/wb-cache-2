These reforms included outlawing slavery, nationalizing land to equally distribute between households, and introducing new currencies, a change which debased the value of coinage. Although these reforms provoked considerable opposition, Wang's regime met its ultimate downfall with the massive floods of c. 3 AD and 11 AD. Gradual silt buildup in the Yellow River had raised its water level and overwhelmed the <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> <b>works.</b> The Yellow River split into two new branches: one emptying {{to the north and}} the other to the south of the Shandong Peninsula, though Han engineers managed to dam the southern branch by 70 AD.|$|E
5|$|Starting in the 1850s {{during the}} California Gold Rush, {{the city of}} Sacramento rapidly grew around the {{confluence}} of the Sacramento River and its tributary the American River, near the middle of the Central Valley of California. The city's increasing population necessitated the construction of an extensive system of levees on the two rivers to prevent flooding. These early <b>flood</b> <b>control</b> <b>works</b> were insufficient; in 1862, the city was inundated so completely that the state government was temporarily moved to San Francisco. In 1956, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built the Folsom Dam at {{the confluence of the}} North and South Forks of the American River to provide flood control for the Sacramento metropolitan area. However, the Folsom Dam with a capacity of just 1 million acre feet (1.2 km3) compared to the annual American River flow of 2.7 million acre feet (3.3 km3) proved inadequate. A flood in 1955 filled the Folsom Reservoir to capacity, before the dam was even completed; it has also overflowed many times since.|$|E

He directed the efforts of conscripted corvée laborers until this duty was transferred to the ministry of the newly created Excellency of Works in 8 BC. The Court Architect's subordinates were responsible for gathering timber for carpenters and stone for masons. Although his office existed at the establishment of Eastern Han, it was abolished in 57 AD and his duties were transferred to an Internuncio in the Ministry of the Household. However, the post was reinstated in 76 AD with the original salary-rank, yet many of his subordinates remained abolished. Since most buildings were constructed from wood, with ceramic roof tiles, a large workforce was needed to maintain buildings that fell into disrepair. The restoration of the Imperial University during Emperor Shun's (r. 125–144 AD) reign required 100,000 laborers to work for a year under the supervision of the Court Architect.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has been conducted on vegetation such as dense layered grasses and on the rigid blockage of cylindrical tree trunks. However, little has been studied on the resistance effects of plants and shrubs that are either submerged or partially submerged by turbulent flows. The flexible stems and varying shapes of the plant 2 ̆ 7 s leaf mass greatly complicate the understanding of resistance. The deformation of plant shape with flow precludes the use of a constant blockage or plant density in predicting resistance. This paper presents laboratory tests of vegetation with different plant types, sizes, densities, and combinations of plants. Testing included variation in flow depths, variation in velocity, the effect of plants with and without leaves, and variation in the submergence of the plants. A methodology for determining vegetation resistance was developed for application with field data, estimated plant characteristics, and compound channels. Additional field tests were later conducted to verify the methodology and set of equations developed from the laboratory tests. This abstract is based on a research project funded by the U. S. Army Engineers Waterways Experiment Station, Vicksburg, MS.

The agreement is, she need not give him the 'Puttu' which is in good shape, but only the left-overs. The old lady agreed. But Lord Shiva, with his magical powers, made each of the 'Puttu' she cooked as a shapeless unsellable left-over and ate every thing. And worse, he didn't do any work in the river Vaigai either but he chose to sleep under a tree. The King, who was supervising the work, found the lazy man and beat him at the back with a stick. As per the myth, everyone including the king felt the pain in their back. Then the king came to know that the lazy man is none other than lord Shiva and apologised. Even now, to mark this event, on September 4 of every year, a function is held in the river bank of Arappalayam and 'Puttu' is cooked in every household.|$|R
