40|$|This paper {{responds}} to the recent backlash against AIDS-specific funding by setting out the key claims and examining the evidence to determine which criticisms are justified, and which are not. The backlash against international funding for AIDS has taken a number of forms, with some suggesting that {{the extent of the}} problem (the HIV epidemic) has been exaggerated and others arguing that UNAIDS programme efforts have been misdirected. A key claim however, is that AIDS-related funding has undermined health systems in developing countries. A primary contributor to the backlash has been Roger England, who asserts that the international AIDS response has produced “the biggest vertical programme in history” and that this funding “could be more effective if used to strengthen public health” (England, 2007 : 344). The reasoning behind this argument has been that the sheer scale of international funding for AIDS has not only been unwarranted, but that it has damaged health systems in developing countries by diverting resources from other areas of the health sector (see argument summarised in Nattrass and Gonsalves (2009 : 1)). Ultimately the recommendation is that AIDS-specific funding must be curtailed and the resources instead channelled through sector-wide <b>general</b> <b>budget</b> arrangements to <b>support</b> health systems more generally and to allow domestic priorities to direct spending decisions...|$|R

40|$|New modern aid was {{initiated}} {{during the latter}} half of the 1990 s by most of the leading actors within the international donor community to make the whole aid-procedure more effective, more lucid and more on the receiving states’ conditions. <b>Budget</b> <b>Support</b> is a tool within this “partnership-aid” transformation where the distribution goes directly to the receiver state’s governmental budget and thus strengthens the institutions of the state. As the governmental institutions gain more power, other actors might gain less power than before. It is problematic if Civil Society gains less power because one prerequisite to obtain <b>Budget</b> <b>Support</b> is to have a well functioning Civil Society. So if <b>Budget</b> <b>Support</b> leads to a weaker Civil Society it undermines the initial prerequisites to obtain <b>Budget</b> <b>Support</b> in the first place. The core of this thesis is to see whether this possible paradox is a reality. The target for this thesis is Uganda, a country which has been a pioneer in implementing new aid initiatives by the donor community, with an elaborate <b>Budget</b> <b>Support</b> framework. The study focuses on effects from <b>Budget</b> <b>Support</b> on Anti-Corruption Organizations (AC-CSOs) within Civil Society. To make the effects visual, the AC-CSOs’ relation to donors and the Government of Uganda (GoU) after the <b>Budget</b> <b>Support</b> implementation is investigated. Qualitative research interviews are made with 16 AC-CSOs. The findings show that most of the interviewed AC-CSOs are marginalized by the GoU after <b>Budget</b> <b>Support</b> implementation and almost half of them are marginalized by donors. Thus, <b>Budget</b> <b>Support</b> tends to be a part of the marginalization process for AC-CSOs. The direct distribution of funds to the GoU increases the government’s power and the process tends to lead to a position/object relation with AC-CSOs. Also, donors tend not to give AC-CSOs the support to stop this process. In addition, donors favour Watchdog Organizations over Service Delivery Organizations. As Civil Society tends to be weakened with <b>Budget</b> <b>Support</b> implementation, the structure of <b>Budget</b> <b>Support</b> could be considered as unsustainable in Uganda...|$|R

This paper argues that donors may exercise selectivity over the aid modality.

We test this for European Commission and World Bank <b>budget</b> <b>support</b> over 1997 – 2009 and find some support. Both donors have given <b>budget</b> <b>support</b> to almost half of the countries they give aid, and it is usually a significant share of their aid.

These variables did not, however, influence the amount of <b>budget</b> <b>support</b> given.
