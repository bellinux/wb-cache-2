5|$|Edward II succeeded as king of England on 7 July 1307, on {{the death}} of his father Edward I. The {{expectations}} of the new king were high, and he initially enjoyed a good relationship with the leading magnates of the realm. There were, however, some issues of contention remaining from the reign of his father. Edward I's incessant wars had put a great <b>fiscal</b> <b>burden</b> on the country, and his confrontational style had led to conflict with some of the leading lay and ecclesiastical lords. This had culminated in the drafting of the so-called Remonstrances in 1297, a set of complaints about royal government. By Edward I's death in 1307, most of these issued had been resolved. It was nevertheless in the interest of the leading men of the country to make sure that the new king did not act the way his father had, and ignored the opinions of his councillors.|$|E
25|$|The {{power sector}} in the Dominican Republic has {{traditionally}} been, and still is, a bottleneck to the country's economic growth. A prolonged electricity crisis and ineffective remedial measures {{have led to a}} vicious cycle of regular blackouts, high operating costs of the distribution companies, large losses including electricity theft through illegal connections, high retail tariffs to cover these inefficiencies, low bill collection rates, a significant <b>fiscal</b> <b>burden</b> for the government through direct and indirect subsidies, and very high costs for consumers as many of them have to rely on expensive alternative self-generated electricity.

Using a daily measure of inflation expectations extracted from nominal and indexed-linked government bonds, or inflation swaps, we test whether these react to alternative measures of <b>fiscal</b> <b>burdens.</b> These include rescue package announcements, credit default swap (CDS) spreads and changes in either the outlook or the credit rating of governments.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{municipalities}} in Japan has decreased from 3, 232 in 1999 to 1, 820 in 2006 because of municipal mergers, called Heisei-no-Daigappei. This paper estimates the political choices of local council members in Japan’s municipal mergers. In Japan, being a local council member {{is a full-time}} job. The local council has “veto powers” over local administration. Since the wage for a local council member is quite high, council members like to keep their seats. The jobs of local council members are affected by municipal mergers, as preferential treatment and penalties are delivered by the central government to the local government in municipal mergers. In our results, merged municipalities apply “Special Provisions” for local council members {{because of the size}} of the municipality. The choice of municipality is also affected by the national government’s political power. In addition, Special Provisions lead to additional <b>fiscal</b> <b>burdens.</b> These <b>fiscal</b> <b>burdens</b> will transfer to the whole country because “the Local Allocation Tax grants system” (abbreviated as LAT grants), a national grants system, works well in Japan. The municipalities that choose the Special Provisions exploit the benefits from other municipalities without any additional costs. Our results show that the central government induces the free-rider problem in Japan. ...|$|R

Their calculations suggest that, despite recent changes, U.
