30|$|In each interim or annual {{financial}} statement, FAS 159 requires {{firms to}} disclose their reasons for electing the fair value option for each item. Firms also need to disclose which balance sheet items contain liabilities for which the FVOL has been elected. FAS 159 further requires firms to disclose gains and losses from fair value changes for each income statement line item included in earnings. Generally, gains and losses from changes in fair values for which the FVOL has been elected {{do not need to}} be <b>disclosed</b> <b>separately</b> from other fair value changes in the same line item. As an exception, firms need to <b>separately</b> <b>disclose</b> gains and losses from fair value changes that are attributable to changes in firms’ own credit risk. For example, if a firm’s ability to meet its outstanding debt decreases, the market value of its issued debt decreases simultaneously. On the other hand, if markets assume that a firm’s solvency improved, its liabilities’ market values increase. Such value changes are called DVAs—debt valuation adjustments due to a change in own credit risk.|$|R

40|$|Materiality {{thresholds}} are {{the dividing}} line between material and immaterial information. Recognition materiality thresholds are {{the dividing line}} between what is recorded {{and what is not}} recorded in the accounts. Disclosure materiality thresholds are the dividing line between what is <b>separately</b> <b>disclosed</b> in the financial statements and what is not <b>separately</b> <b>disclosed.</b> Auditors materiality thresholds are important because they have a significant influence on what information is recorded in the accounts and disclosed in financial statements and hence available for decision making by external parties. However, there are no research findings about recognition thresholds, and those in relation to disclosure thresholds show a lack of consensus. Hence the motivation for this research. The objective of the research is to study auditors' recognition and disclosure thresholds within the context of industry, which is divided into the industry of the firm and the industry specialization (experience) of the auditor. The results of the study show that: (1) Recognition thresholds are significantly lower than disclosure thresholds. (2) The mean thresholds are 5 緥 (recognition) and 8 緥 (disclosure). These are in the 5 % to 10 % guideline provided by Australian accounting standards. (3) The thresholds appear to vary with industry market risk. (4) Auditors appear to use the thresholds from the industry in which they specialize, in an industry in which they do not specialize. The paper discusses the implications of these findings.

40|$|How {{components}} of profit should be classified and displayed in financial reports {{has been the}} subject of much debate and has been given considerable attention by accounting standard-setters. The debate has centred on distinguishing profit from ordinary operations and profit arising from events outside the ordinary operations of the business, identifying which {{components of}} profit from ordinary operations should be <b>disclosed</b> <b>separately,</b> and the form those disclosures should take. Over time, Australian accounting standards have changed in their requirements for distinguishing between extraordinary items and operating profit, and for separate disclosure of certain components of operating profit. Until 1989, Australian companies frequently reported extraordinary items, distinguishing them from profit from ordinary operations. Perceptions of companies opportunistically classifying income and expense items as extraordinary led to the standard-setters tightening the definition to the extent that items would meet the definition only in very rare cases. In examining reporting practices before and after this change, Houghton (1994) observed a significant increase in the frequency of profit and loss (P&L) items being classified as 'abnormal items' after 1989, and found that they were, on average, losses, whereas they were previously, on average, gains. Classification of P&L items as abnormal attracted the attention of regulators and the media in the late 1990 s, and concerns were raised that items that should have been classified as part of profit from normal operations were being classified as abnormal to improve reported 'normal' earnings (see McLean 1999). When the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) proposed to remove the abnormal items classification from accounting standards, some respondents to the exposure draft supported the move, while others argued that it inhibited companies' ability to indicate the underlying transitory nature of some items. Revisions to accounting standards nevertheless proceeded and, from 2001, Australian companies were no longer permitted to classify P&L items as abnormal. The controversy surrounding the perceived abuses of classifying P&L items as abnormal, and the opposition to removal of the abnormal classification from accounting standards, raises the question of whether the change was justified. This paper addresses this question by examining whether there was an increase in the frequency and magnitude of abnormal items over the seven-year period up to the removal of the 'abnormal' classification from accounting standards.

40|$|Accounting {{textbooks}} develop separate frameworks {{to compute}} the gross profit for profitable and unprofitable contracts under the percentage completion method. The {{reason for this is}} the necessity to recognize the future losses as part of the costs of construction. This paper proposes a method that captures the economic consequences of the contract and uses the same framework for the calculation of the gross profit regardless of the financial outcome. This is achieved by disclosing the actual costs incurred as the costs of construction and then recognizing separately the provision for future losses after the gross profit. It is argued that any provision for future losses should be <b>separately</b> <b>disclosed</b> as this is viewed as important information regarding management’s performance...|$|R
40|$|Forestry {{has been}} {{monitored}} in agricultural profitability book-keeping {{as a separate}} business area since 1912 by the Economic Research of the MTT Agrifood Research Finland. At present, the monitoring {{is based on the}} accounting data collected annually from approximately 1050 book-keeping farms. The monitoring is grounded on the profitability book-keeping application, MARTTI, and an Internet based reporting system, EconomyDoctor. Since 1995, the Finnish data for the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) of the member states of the European Union (EU) has also been supplied by MTT Economic Research, which is the authorized Finnish Agency in the FADN network. The book-keeping data collected from farms is used to calculate the closing of accounts, i. e. the profit and loss statement and balance sheet, as well as key economic ratios for each production line. Forestry incomes and expenditures are collected, as well as labour and property data. The key element of developments forest accounting is the availability of the forest inventory contained in the forest management plan (FMP) of a forest holding. Moreover, owners report all updates, such as fellings and silvicultural activities, after the forest inventory. Using the updated forest inventory, the MELA FMP software of the Finnish Forest Research Institute (Metla) provides the values of the growing stock and bare land and returns these to the MARTTI accounting system. These information systems have been integrated via the Internet using the XML protocol and service procedures, firewalls, etc. information and communication technologies (ICT). The established forestry book-keeping procedure provides reliable information for the purpose of financial statements. The financial statements have been drawn up using the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and especially its International Accounting Standards (IAS) 41 - Agriculture for the growing stock and IAS 16 - Property, Plant and Equipment for the bare land. The key IAS notion of fair value as the evaluation basis can, in the case of forestry be interpreted loosely as net present value (NPV). The fair value of the growing stock fluctuates annually according to the impact of the net increase and fellings. Both physical and price changes affect the net profit according to IAS 41. The key aspect of the development is the evaluation of the IAS fair value of the growing stock, classified as mature and immature biological assets, and their annual changes. The changes due to stumpage price and physical change in the growing stock are also to be <b>disclosed</b> <b>separately.</b> Moreover, the fair value of bare land is also estimated annually for each stand. The {{purpose of this study is}} to apply all relevant IAS/IFRS statutes and relevant theoretical contributions to determine whether the international accounting standards (IASs) are applicable in profitability book-keeping for forest holdings in order to support rural entrepreneurship. The structure of the financial statement reports accords to the IAS standards. The applicability of the IAS standards have been tested with the data and technical framework of the profitability book-keeping system of the MTT Economic Research. vo...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis study {{investigates the}} extent to which three key summary {{accounting}} income figures, namely operating income (OPI), net income (NI) and comprehensive income (CI), provide value-relevant information to investors in major EU capital markets. Using a large sample over the pre-IAS-compliance period (1992 - 2004), we find that all these three figures are statistically associated with share returns in any of the countries under analysis although disparities in the degree of 'usefulness' appear across samples. Our main results are then threefold. We first provide evidence that CI is less value-relevant than both NI and OPI in all the sample countries. Second, our results show that aggregate OCI is value-relevant and generally provides incremental price-relevant information beyond NI. This finding is rather different from the existing US literature that suggests OCI is usually not value-relevant especially when not <b>separately</b> <b>disclosed</b> in financial statements. Finally, considering early adoption firms, we find that increased transparency on reporting OCI as required by the UK FRS 3 and US SFAS 130 standards may have warranted a stronger statistical association between share returns and CI.

40|$|Materiality {{is a key}} {{concept in}} {{accounting}} theory and practice. Yet differing views exist {{in regard to the}} practical application of the materiality concept amongst preparers, auditors, users of financial reports and regulators (ESMA/ 2011 / 373). Unlike International Accounting Standards, in Australia AASB 1031 Materiality addresses materiality thresholds. The pre- 2000 period, when Australian firms were required to <b>separately</b> <b>disclose</b> abnormal items in their financial reports, provides a unique opportunity to explore how the concept of materiality was applied. Abnormal items were considered abnormal by reason of their size and effect on operating earnings. We investigate whether immaterial or marginally material items were classified as abnormal, and whether materiality thresholds were consistently applied to different types of abnormal items and over time. Findings show almost a quarter (22. 94 %) of abnormal items were immaterial for which the overall mean was only 2. 54 % of the baseline earnings before abnormal items. Results are consistent when abnormal items are classified into the four predominant types by which described in financial reports and when further dissected into the forty categories by which they were themed. The outcomes of this analysis inform the current regulatory debate concerning the inclusion of immaterial items in financial reports which may mislead users (FRRP 2013) and the IASB materiality project (2013).

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the extent of Malaysian directors’ remuneration disclosure in the annual reports. In addition, this research seeks {{to examine the relationship}} between corporate governance structure and the disclosure practices of directors’ remuneration. We measure the extent of directors’ remuneration disclosure by the following four measures – the disclosure of individual pay for each director, band of pay, linkage to performance, and components of pay. Drawing on agency theory, we expect that the extent of directors’ remuneration disclosure is positively associated with the independence of boards of directors, audit committees and remuneration committees. In addition, we expect an inverse relationship between directors’ remuneration disclosure and ownership structure. The annual reports of 376 companies listed on Bursa Malaysia are randomly selected and analyzed. The results reveal that most of the sampled firms communicate information about the directors’ pay in bands of RM 50, 000, together with the narration of linkages between the directors’ pay and performance in their annual reports. Not many companies disclose information about individual directors’ pay, or <b>separately</b> <b>disclose</b> the salary and bonus components. In addition, the regression results suggest that the independent of board of director and remuneration committee are associated with disclosure of directors’ pay bands. Bigger firms are more likely to communicate individual director’s pay, and disclose salary and bonus components separately in their annual reports. The findings have important implication in understanding the disclosure practices of companies in relation to the directors’ remuneration...|$|R
