40|$|Si–air batteries, {{unlike other}} {{resource}} efficient metal–air batteries that were subject of investigations {{for quite a}} long time, came to the focus of research only recently. When operated with alkaline electrolyte, severe limitations of the discharge capacities were reported, which were attributed to a passivation layer on the anode. As a consequence, only small fractions of the surface from Si-anodes could be used for discharge. The objective of the present work is to reconsider the discharge behavior of Si–air cells with KOH electrolyte and to point out how a discharge process can be put forward until the complete anode is exhausted. Operating Si–air cells with alkaline electrolyte causes substantial corrosion, which produces also hydrogen gas as a reaction product. Moreover, along with the dissolution of Si in KOH, condensation of silicate structures in the electrolyte has been observed. Both effects accelerate electrolyte loss in the cell. Therefore, appropriately balancing the <b>electrolyte</b> <b>supply</b> of the Si–air cell is a precondition for ongoing discharge. Specifically, cells with As-doped Si-wafer anodes with 0. 6 mm and 3. 0 mm thickness were discharged in 5 M KOH electrolyte at current densities up to 0. 05 mA/cm 2 for 260 and 1100 hours, respectively. The drawback is that a minimum amount of electrolyte is required in order not to exceed 4 M Si content, which otherwise leads to a gelation of the electrolyte.

40|$|International audienceEtching is a {{key process}} in the {{fabrication}} of silicon (Si) microstructures that are essential for several component families used in microelectronics, photonics and photovoltaics, among others. A large variety of microstructuring technologies exists nowadays (e. g. wet/dry etchings based on photo/electron beam lithography patterning). Their remarkable efficacy comes {{at the expense of}} several lithography (masking) /etching steps that are not suitable for all industries, i. e. when reduced cost and manufacturing time are key aspects (e. g. Si solar cells manufacturing). Hence, the development of a maskless technique with direct imprinting of patterns would dramatically simplify the fabrication process. However, eliminating the use of masks and move towards micromachining techniques has turned to be extremely challenging. Only a few achievements in the field of (electro) chemistry {{have been reported in the}} literature [1 - 4]. The most recent development is an electrochemical version of the metal assisted chemical etching method used to produce high aspect ratio nanostructures: a noble metal electrode is put in contact with a Si sample in a HF solution and polarized against a counter electrode; in the contacted areas the metal plays the role of etching tool by oxidizing/dissolving Si atoms [2, 3]. The major problem encountered with this configuration lies in the intimate Si/metal contact, which hinders <b>electrolyte</b> <b>supply</b> over macroscopic distances. Hence, etching is very slow, starting from the edge of the metal tool and progressing laterally. An efficient pattern transfer has been recently demonstrated in the case of porous Si etching with a gold coated stamp, the porous Si network allowing the electrolyte to reach the Si/Au interface [4]. In this work, we present a new strategy to achieve pattern transfer into Si by a single step electrochemical (EC) contact etching with large dimension metal tools, as schemed in Figure 1 a. Figure 1. a) Scheme of the electrochemical contact etching process; b, c) optical and SEM images of a n-type (100) Si surface after imprinting a pattern of inverted pyramids with d) a nanoporous Au electrode. The problematic diffusion of the electrolyte is solved by using for the first time nanoporous metal electrodes, which give access for the electrolyte to the whole Si/metal interface. Thus, etching is achieved with a priori no restriction on the dimensions of the treated surfaces. Our first results demonstrate the transfer of a well-defined array of square inverted pyramids over a treated area of approximately 1 mm 2 (Figure 1 b and 1 c) in a single step and without any prior lithography or masking process of the substrate. The etched pyramids are not aligned with the [001] and [010] directions of the (100) oriented sample (21 ° off) which clearly indicate that the pattern transfer is independent of the crystallographic orientation. This is a proof of concept for EC contact etching with nanoporous metal imprints, with a high potential for Si surface texturization (e. g. solar cells) [5]...|$|E
40|$|The {{manufacturing}} technology electrochemical machining (ECM) finds numerous applications in industrial production. Especially for shaping and surface structuring of metals by controlled anodic dissolution {{the process is}} used. The advantages of ECM are mainly the high removal rates, the slight influence on the work piece material structure and the independence of material strength and hardness. Thus ECM is advantage compared to metal cutting manufacturing processes. Precise electrochemical machining (PEM) is an innovative machining technology which results from further development of the electrochemical sinking. PEM works with pulsed low frequency direct current and oscillation of the tool electrode. It enables the manufacturing of tools and machine elements with high precision requirements and reproduction accuracy. [1, 2] With PEM actually the manufacturing of structure sizes < 1 mm and flatness < 5 µm by front surface machining is possible. As {{part of the project}} ‘Electrochemical machining of internal precision and micro-geometries with high aspect ratios by process-state-dependent electrolyte management‘ (ElAs) the aim is to develop a new combination of high pressure flush and a flexible electrode concept. Filigreed electrodes with structure elements smaller than 0. 2 mm are targeted for the aimed manufacturing of big aspect ratios. Moreover inner micro structures are obstacle by them self for the needed electrolyte flush in the working cap. Due to this the manufacturing process has to be qualified to a non-flux of electrolyte at the dissolution process. Interaction between conduction and the geometry of the electrodes should be avoided. Therefore a closed process device has to be developed which is able to admit a defined pressure charge. By concerted modifications the oscillation inducted effect of compression should become accessible as input parameter for the process. Experimental research of model geometries regarding to the electrode shape, the inducted compression, the precision, the surface and the current efficiency are content of the project. Multiphysics simulations are applied to characterise the modified process. For the simulation of the electrolyte flow in the closed device COMSOL MultiphysicsTM is used. To get use of the simulation software a suitable model geometry had to be deducted and initial values were defined. The closed device has a cylindrical shape with connections for the <b>electrolyte</b> <b>supply.</b> Thus the device isn’t rotationally symmetric. The electrolyte flow results from interaction of the transverse flow and the tool electrode oscillation. One challenge is to develop a model which fits the geometric requirements of the closed device and even the requirements for simulation. The numerical simulations of high turbulent flows are really sophisticated and a lot of computing power is needed [3]. Therefore the simulation was designed in a 2 -dimensional environment and the geometric specifications were adjusted accordingly to comply with these claims. By solving a transient model of turbulent flow the field of velocity in the closed device could be shown. It can be recognized that the field of velocity in the closed device is highly turbulent with many random vortexes. This is due to the interaction of oscillating velocity at the upper edge of the model and the transverse flux in the closed device...|$|E

Therefore, there is a broad interest in reducing the operating temperatureof SOFCs. The key to development of low-temperature SOFCs (LTSOFCs) is to explorenew electrolyte materials with high ionic conductivity at such low temperature (300 - 600 °C). Recently, ceria-based composite electrolyte, consisting of doped cerium oxide mixedwith a second phase (e. g. Na 2 CO 3), has been investigated as a promising electrolyte forLTSOFCs. The ceria-based composite electrolyte has shown a high ionic conductivityand improved fuel cell performance below 600 °C. However, at present the developmentof composite electrolyte materials and their application in LTSOFCs are still at an initialstage. This thesis aims at exploring new composite systems for LTSOFCs with superiorproperties, and investigates conductivity behavior of the electrolyte. Two compositesystems for SOFCs have been studied in the thesis. In the first system, a novel concept of non-ceria-salt-composites electrolyte, LiAlO 2 -carbonate (Li 2 CO 3 -Na 2 CO 3) composite electrolyte, was investigated for SOFCs. TheLiAlO 2 -carbonate electrolyte exhibited good conductivity and excellent fuel cellperformances below 650 oC. The ion transport mechanism of the LiAlO 2 -carbonatecomposite electrolyte was studied. The results indicated that the high ionic conductivityrelates to the interface effect between oxide and carbonate. In the second system, we reported a novel core-shell samarium-doped ceria(SDC) /Na 2 CO 3 nanocomposite which is proposed for the first time, since the interface isdominant in the nanostructured composite materials. The core-shell nanocompositeparticles are smaller than 100 nm with amorphous Na 2 CO 3 shell. The nanocompositeelectrolyte was applied in LTSOFCs and showed excellent performance. Theconductivity behavior and charge carriers have been studied. The results indicated that H+conductivity in SDC/Na 2 CO 3 nanocomposite is predominant over O 2 - conductivity with 1 - 2 orders of magnitude in the temperature range of 200 - 600 °C.

In this thesis, we are aiming at exploring nanostructured composite materials for LTSOFCs with superior properties, investigating the detailed conduction mechanism for their enhanced ionic conductivity, and extending more suitable composite system and nanostructure materials. In the first part, core-shell samarium doped ceria-carbonate nanocomposite (SDC/Na 2 CO 3) was synthesized for the first time. The core-shell nanocomposite was composed of SDC particles smaller than 100 nm coated with amorphous Na 2 CO 3 shell. The nanocomposite has been applied in LTSOFCs with excellent performance. A freeze dry method was used to prepare the SDC/Na 2 CO 3 nanocomposites, aiming to further enhance its phase homogeneity. The ionic conduction behavior of the SDC/Na 2 CO 3 nanocomposite has been studied. The results indicated that H+ conductivity in the nanocomposite is predominant over O 2 - conductivity with 1 - 2 orders of magnitude in the temperature range of 200 - 600 °C, indicating the proton conduction in the nanocomposite mainly accounts for the enhanced total ionic conductivity. The influence of Na 2 CO 3 content to the proton and oxygen ion conductivity in the nanocomposite was studied as well. In the second part, both the proton and oxygen ion conduction mechanisms have been studied. It is suggested that the interface in the nanocomposite <b>electrolyte</b> <b>supplies</b> high conductive path for the proton, while oxygen ions are probably transported by the SDC grain interiors. An empirical “Swing Model” has been proposed as a possible mechanism of superior proton conduction, while oxygen ion conduction is attributed to oxygen vacancies through SDC grain in nanocomposite electrolyte.

In particular, it is currently not possible to adjust the flow coefficient and the cavitation point independent of each other. The flow coefficient significantly influences the atomization, while the cavitation is necessary to prevent coking of the injection holes. One way to decouple the flow coefficient and cavitation behavior is a functional edge rounding of the borehole. This cannot be represented by the previous ly applied hydroerosive rounding.

The {{fuel cell stack}} (10) comprises multiple elements (62, 63, 64, 70) stacked together, wherein {{at least some of the}} elements (62, 63, 64) comprise a plate having a surface that is intended to abut a surface of an adjacent element (70). The plate (62, 63, 64) defines a first surface portion that is to be sealed to the adjacent element, the first surface portion defining a groove with a sealing element of resilient polymeric material (72, 73, 74) moulded into the groove and projecting out of the groove. The plate also defines a second surface portion that is exposed, such that when stacked and compressed together the resilient polymeric material (72, 73, 74) is compressed entirely into the surface groove and seals onto the surface of the adjacent element (70) whereas the second surface portion is in direct contact with the surface of the adjacent element (70). When the stack (10) is compressed, the length of the stack is well-defined. The sealing takes place only where sealing is required, and is more reliable...|$|R

RESULTS Several carbon felts were characterized for their electrode activity. A commercially <b>supplied</b> <b>electrolyte</b> of unknown composition was analysed and was shown to contain a VO 2 +: V 3 + ratio of 4. 8 : 1 (total vanadium species = 1. 5 mol dm− 3) in 4 mol dm− 3 H 2 SO 4. A battery (100 cm 2) was assembled using three-dimensional carbon felts and planar carbon feeders as the electrodes with a Nafion® 115 proton exchange membrane. Performance was examined using electrolytes of varying vanadium ion concentration at volumetric flow rating from 0. 5 – 3 mL min 1. A suitable volumetric flow rate of electrolyte through each half-cell was found to be in the range 1. 5 – 2. 0 mL min− 1, corresponding to a mean linear electrolyte velocity of 1. 0 – 10. 1 cm s− 1 through the carbon felt electrode.

40|$|In the Collaborative Research Centre (CRC) 692 HALS at TU Chemnitz {{numerous}} {{academic institutions}} work on high-strength particle reinforced aluminium matrix composites (AMCs). AMCs consist of an aluminium matrix, which {{is reinforced by}} SiC or Al 2 O 3 particles with dimensions less or equal 1 µm. The Finishing machining of AMCs by electrochemical machining (ECM) is one main task of the CRC. ECM {{is based on a}}nodic dissolution and has a slight influence on the work piece material structure. The material removal depends on the electrochemical dissolution characteristics and is independent of material strength and hardness. Because the electrochemical dissolution characteristics are hardly to predict, especially in composites like AMCs, a new experimental analysis method was developed. To realize this new experimental analysis method a special analysing device was designed and manufactured. The analysing device is based on a flow cell which is integrated in an existing prototype system for ECM. The self-built prototype system consists of the necessary periphery for the analysing process, such as power <b>supply,</b> <b>electrolyte</b> pump or control-PC [1]. Besides this a multiphysics model was developed to study the ECM process and to detect settings {{for the use of the}} analysing device [2]. In this study the new experimental analysis method is applied to analyse the electrochemical dissolution characteristics of AMCs. The experimental results will be presented referring to results of multiphysics simulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of chemical ground improvement using the electrokinetic stabilisation (EKS) method {{has the potential}} to overcome problems soft highly compressibility soil. This technique {{has the potential to}} enhance the strength and reduce compressibility {{of a wide range of}} soils. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of EKS as an effective method to strengthen soft clay soils. A detailed laboratory programme of work was conducted using the initial base model developed by Liaki (2006). This study was conducted in two stages using laboratory scale models, using an inactive kaolinite clay. The test model using reusable Electrokinetic Geosythentics (EKG) developed at the Newcastle University to apply a constant voltage gradient of 50 Vlm across a soil sample approximately 400 rnrn. The first stage involved testing of a 'pure' system with distilled water as the main pore <b>electrolyte</b> fluid <b>supplied</b> under zer,o hydraulic gradient conditions $ for periods of 3, 7 and 14 days. The second stage repeated test using calcium chloride and distilled water (CaC 1 -DW), DW and sodium silicate (DW-NaSiO) and CaC 1 -NaSiO, at the anode and cathode, respectively. Throughout both physical and chemical characteristics were measured. This enabled assessment of the design and configuration that could be used in the field together with a number of key limitations. The data presented herein enables a fuller understanding of the mechanisms contributing to the improvements achieved and how effective monitoring through the use of relatively simple test, e. g. pH and Atterberg Limits, can be achieved. Specifically cation exchange was considered to be the main mechanism causing a significant increase in shear strength observed for the CaCl-DW system with the increase seen to be more uniform across the soil sample for a period up to 14 days. This was supported by results of Atterberg limits, pH, electrical conductivity and chemical concentrations. Precipitation and cation exchange are the main contributors to the increase of shear strength for the CaC 1 -NaSiO system after 7 and 14 days treatment. However, precipitation of CSH gels has greater influence on the shear strength at the near proximity of cathode followed by cation exchange at the near proximity of anode and at the remainder of the soil sample...|$|R

40|$|SSCI-VIDE+CARE+PVEInternational audienceElectrochemical Promotion of Catalysis (EPOC), {{also called}} Non-Faradaic Electrochemical Modification of Catalytic Activity (NEMCA), is a {{promising}} concept for boosting catalytic processes and advancing {{the frontiers of}} catalysis [1]. This innovative field aims to modify in-operando both the activity and the selectivity of catalysts, in a reversible and controlled manner. EPOC utilizes solid electrolyte materials (ionically conducting ceramics) as catalytic carriers. Ions contained in these <b>electrolytes</b> are electrochemically <b>supplied</b> to the catalyst surface and act as promoting agents to modify the catalyst electronic properties {{in order to achieve}} optimal catalytic performance. It thus provides a unique means of varying promoter levels at the metal surface under reaction conditions by simply changing the potential of the catalyst film. The main advantage of EPOC is that the electrochemical activation magnitude is much higher th an that predicted by Faradayâs law. Therefore, EPOC requires low currents or potentials. Moreover, promoting species such as O 2 - cannot be formed via gaseous adsorption and cannot be easily dosed by chemical ways. The EPOC technology consists in the implementation of catalysis in an electrochemical cell by using electrochemical catalysts which consist of a catalytic layer interfaced on an ionically conducting ceramic support. The latter serves as an electrically controlled source or sink of ionic promoter species that activate and modulate the behavior of the catalytic surface. Figure 1 a displays a typical EPOC reactor. The catalytic layer, typically 40 nm to 10 ï­m thick, is deposited on a dense solid electrolyte membrane (Figure 1 a). This catalytic layer must be electronic conductor to allow the polarization. Therefore, the catalyst is also an electrode and is then named catalyst-electrode. A counter-electrode and a reference electrode, both catalytically inert, are dep osited {{on the other side of}} the membrane (Figure 1 a). An electrical current density (1 - 500 ÂµA/cm 2) or potential (ï± 2 V) is applied between the catalyst and the counter electrode. The reactants are co-fed over the porous electrochemical catalytic layer. Figure 1 b displays a typical example of an EPOC experiment for the propane deep oxidation. The electrochemical catalyst was composed of a Pt thin film deposited by Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) on a dense membrane of Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ), an O 2 - ionic conductor. A positive current (from + 10 up to + 500 ÂµA) can strongly increase the propane conversion with a non-Faradaic manner, since the activation is up to 300 times higher than that predicted by the Faradayâs law through the electrochemical oxidation of propane. This lecture will give an overview of recent advances of EPOC for environmental applications, such as hydrocarbon oxidation, soot combustion and NOx abatement...|$|R
