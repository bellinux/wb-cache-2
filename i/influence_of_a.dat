5|$|After briefly {{moving over}} land, Keith turned north under the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{trailing}} frontal trough. The storm became disorganized while recurving northeast {{because of increased}} vertical wind shear {{and the presence of}} cool dry air from its north. On November23, Keith made landfall near Sarasota, Florida, with winds of 65mph (100km/h), while most of its convection was well {{to the north of the}} center. Its landfall was the second latest on record for the Continental United States, only behind a hurricane in the 1925 season. The storm quickly weakened as it crossed Florida, and within hours the winds dropped to 40mph (65km/h). Reaching the Atlantic Ocean eight hours after moving ashore, Keith began to gradually re-intensify, and under the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> very large upper-level low pressure area over Newfoundland, the storm accelerated northeast. On November24, the storm again reached its peak intensity of 70mph (110km/h), shortly before becoming an extratropical cyclone near Bermuda. Keith restrengthened and deepened into a powerful extratropical cyclone, attaining hurricane-force winds and a minimum pressure of 945mbar (27.92inHg). The extratropical storm turned westward and was last observed on November26 northeast of Newfoundland.|$|E

5|$|A large {{tropical}} wave, {{which eventually}} became Erika, moved {{off the coast}} of Africa on August 31. Shortly after leaving the coast, it displayed a large low-level circulation, though as it tracked westward, the circulation failed to contract significantly. It slowly organized, and by September 3 the convection within the circulation had sufficiently organized for the system to be classified as Tropical Depression Six, while located about 1150miles (1850km) east of the southernmost Lesser Antilles. The depression moved west-northwestward at approximately 20mph (32km/h) under the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> well-established subtropical ridge, and late on September 3 the system intensified into a tropical storm. At that time, the National Hurricane Center in Miami gave the storm the name of Erika.|$|E

5|$|A low {{pressure}} area that developed over the southern Andaman Sea late in April moved north into the Bay of Bengal becoming the first depression of the year on May 2. The depression intensified under the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> high-level anticyclone and became a cyclonic storm the next day. The storm {{then turned to the}} northeast and strengthened into a severe cyclonic storm on May 4. Soon after this, it peaked with winds of 150km/h (90mph) and a well-defined eye formed. The storm made its landfall near Cox's Bazar in easternmost East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) early in the morning of May 7 and dissipated over western Burma that evening.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} depression developed from a tropical wave approximately 1,000mi (1,609.3km) east of Barbados on August 24. After forming, the depression moved westward {{and on the}} next day intensified into a tropical storm on the following day. After becoming a tropical storm, Gustav continued to intensify as it headed west-northwestward. Intensification into a hurricane occurred on August 26, as the storm began slowly curving northward under the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> trough. After reaching Category 2 intensity, Gustav was affected by wind shear, and weakened, but eventually re-intensified. The hurricane ultimately peaked as a Category 3 hurricane on August 31, and was also the most intense tropical cyclone of the season, in addition to being the only major hurricane in the Atlantic that year. Around the time of attaining peak intensity, Gustav began a fujiwhara interaction with nearby Tropical Storm Hortense. After attaining peak intensity on August 31, Gustav weakened back, at nearly the same rate as it had intensified, and deteriorated to a tropical storm on September 2. By September 3, Gustav transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, 230mi (370km) south of Iceland.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa on September10. Tracking westward, the wave split into two portions, with the slower-moving northern portion ultimately developing into Atlantic Tropical Depression Nine on September16. The southern portion crossed Venezuela and Colombia and emerged into the Pacific, where a large area of deep convection began to form. A well-defined low pressure area developed on September26, and organized into a tropical depression by 18:00UTC (1p.m.CDT) the same day while situated about 335mi (540km) southwest of Acapulco, Guerrero. Six hours later, after banding features became more defined and intensity estimates using the Dvorak technique showed a slight increase in intensity, the depression was classified as a tropical storm and was accordingly named Marty by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). At the time, the storm was moving slowly northward due to the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large mid- to upper-level trough.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on September16 with copious convection. It tracked westward, developing into Tropical Depression Twelve on September21 while located {{a few hundred miles}} west of Cape Verde. Without intensifying further, the depression turned northward, due to a weakness caused by the deepening of a 200 mbar cut-off low near the Iberian Peninsula. Under the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> building high pressure area, the depression turned to a northwest and later westward drift. It into Tropical Storm Josephine on September24, although increased wind shear from a trough weakened the storm back to a tropical depression on September26. It remained weak for several days, gradually turning to the north due to a weak trough over the northwestern Atlantic. On October1, another high pressure area halted its northward movement, causing Josephine to turn to the east. That day, it re-intensified into a tropical storm as it began to execute a small cyclonic loop. An approaching trough caused Josephine to accelerate north-northeastward, and with favorable conditions it intensified into a hurricane on October5, after existing nearly two weeks.|$|E

5|$|Celestial bodies {{interior}} to {{the orbit}} of Mercury have been hypothesized, and searched for, for centuries. The German astronomer Christoph Scheiner thought he had seen small bodies passing {{in front of the}} Sun in 1611, but these were later shown to be sunspots. In the 1850s, Urbain Le Verrier made detailed calculations of Mercury's orbit and found a small discrepancy in the planet's perihelion precession from predicted values. He postulated that the gravitational <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small planet or ring of asteroids within {{the orbit of}} Mercury would explain the deviation. Shortly afterward, an amateur astronomer named Edmond Lescarbault claimed to have seen Le Verrier's proposed planet transit the Sun. The new planet was quickly named Vulcan but was never seen again, and the anomalous behaviour of Mercury's orbit was explained by Einstein's general theory of relativity in 1915. The vulcanoids take their name from this hypothetical planet. What Lescarbault saw was probably another sunspot.|$|E
5|$|Crossing Madagascar {{for a third}} time, Elita closely {{followed}} the trajectory of its second passage, emerging into the Indian Ocean near Manakara on February3. Despite initial forecasts of re-intensification, Elita accelerated southeastward and lost its remaining convection, leaving its center exposed under the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> strong upper-level trough. The structure resembled a subtropical cyclone as the surface circulation became broader. Late on February4, the JTWC discontinued advisories, and the MFR classified Elita as an extratropical cyclone on the next day. For the next week, the remnants of Elita meandered to the southeast of Madagascar. On February11, the residual circulation tracked southwestward, only to accelerate southeastward away from the region on February13, when the MFR ceased monitoring the system.|$|E

Whilst under the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> subtropical ridgeâ€“or a belt of high pressureâ€“it slowly meandered southwestward and arrived into the Gulf of Mexico on July20. A weak surface circulation was observed near 1900EST (0100UTC on July21) which was affected by an inverted trough as they turned westward. The system's circulation remained indistinct until July23 as winds of 22â€“30knots consorted with squalls adjacent to the coasts of Louisiana and Texas.|$|E
