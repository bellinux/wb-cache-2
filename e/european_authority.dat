25|$|Systems {{of colonial}} rule {{can be broken}} into the binary classifications of direct and {{indirect}} rule. During the era of colonisation, Europeans were faced with the monumental task of administrating the vast colonial territories around the globe. The initial {{solution to this problem}} was direct rule, which involves the establishment of a centralized <b>European</b> <b>authority</b> within a territory run by colonial officials. In a system of direct rule, the native population is excluded from all but the lowest level of the colonial government. Mamdani defines direct rule as centralized despotism: a system where natives were not considered citizens. By contrast, indirect rule integrates pre-established local elites and native institutions into the administration of the colonial government. Indirect rule maintains good pre-colonial institutions and fosters development within the local culture. Mamdani classifies indirect rule as “decentralized despotism,” where day-to-day operations were handled by local chiefs, but the true authority rested with the colonial powers.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} {{interact}} with each other on the voyage, slaves created a communication system unbeknownst to Europeans: They would construct choruses on the passages using their voices, bodies, and ships themselves; the hollow design of the ships allowed slaves to use them as percussive instruments and to amplify their songs. This combination of “instruments” was both a way for slaves to communicate as well as create a new identity since Europeans attempted to strip them of that. Although most slaves were from various regions around Africa, their situation allowed them to come together and create a new culture and identity aboard the ships with a common language and method of communication:Call and response soundings allowed men and women speaking different languages to communicate about the conditions of their captivity. In fact, on board the Hubridas, what began as murmurs and morphed into song erupted before long into the shouts and cries of coordinated revolt.This communication was a direct subversion of <b>European</b> <b>authority</b> and allowed slaves to have a form of power and identity otherwise prohibited. Furthermore, such organization and coming together enabled revolts and uprisings to actually be coordinated and successful at times.|$|E
5000|$|The map {{itself is}} quite detailed, {{covering}} such vast areas as New France, Greenland, Labrador, Hudson Bay, Baffin Bay, and the Great Lakes and Arctic regions. [...] Delisle {{did not attempt}} to fill in areas of white space where his knowledge was insufficient, rather he let these spaces remain, a decision indicative of cartographical renewal in France in that period. In despite of these holes and the scientific nature of his map, Delisle’s 1703 Carte still contains a large amount of information from Indians and considerations on imperial influence. In at least one instance, Delisle employed information from Indians that was not necessarily confirmed by a <b>European</b> <b>authority.</b> For example, on the map, Lake Winnipeg - marked as Lac des Assenipoils - is shown with its water communication down to the Hudson Bay, information taken from an Indian report rather than one of European discovery. Furthermore, although hundreds of Indian tribes were identified in Delisle’s earlier sketches, he consolidated a number of related bands under one heading in his final map. In other instances, information about certain traditional grounds provided in earlier maps, such as those of the Mistassini Cree, was omitted in Delisle’s 1703 map either due to famine, disease, or collapse of hunting grounds.|$|E
5000|$|At its apex, {{it was one}} of {{the largest}} empires in history. Including {{metropolitan}} France, the total amount of land under French sovereignty reached 11500000 km2 in 1920, with a population of 110 million people in 1939. In World War II, Charles de Gaulle and the Free French used the overseas colonies as bases from which they fought to liberate France. Historian Tony Chafer argues: [...] "In an effort to restore its world-power status after the humiliation of defeat and occupation, France was eager to maintain its overseas empire at the end of the Second World War." [...] However, after 1945 anti-colonial movements began to challenge <b>European</b> <b>authority.</b> The French constitution of October 27, 1946 (Fourth Republic), established the French Union which endured until 1958. Newer remnants of the colonial empire were integrated into France as overseas departments and territories within the French Republic. These now total altogether 119,394 km² (46,098 sq. miles), which amounts to only 1% of the pre-1939 French colonial empire's area, with 2.7 million people living in them in 2013. By the 1970s, says Robert Aldrich, the last [...] "vestiges of empire held little interest for the French."

40|$|Social Europe’ has various meanings.

But social Europe may also refer to a political project, aiming at increasing the power of <b>European</b> <b>authorities</b> in social areas: there would be a social Europe like there is today an economic or monetary Europe. This social Europe would lead to unify gradually European social systems.

At the same time the explicit recognition that Social Europe exists and that it should be managed in an open and democratic way, could be a progress as compared to a situation of constrained convergence. Last, Social Europe may refer to a political project aiming at deepening the European Social Model, by unifying social protection, redistribution and employment legislation towards the top.

50|$|The Anglo European School is a self-governing {{state school}} for {{children}} of all abilities with 1,277 pupils aged 11 to 19. It was the first state school in Britain to offer the International Baccalaureate Diploma, {{and the first to}} become a Language College. The school was founded in 1977 with a distinct European ethos. It was declared a specialist language school in 1955 and was the first state school to achieve this. The Anglo European School was in the top 10 most improved schools in Essex for GCSE results in 2009. This year 12% more of the pupils gained five more GCSEs at A* level. The school had been there since 1959 and was almost completely unaltered until 1979 when an extension was built. The first Headteacher, Norman Pitt (1979-1990), decided to make major changes to the school. He built and improved a new language laboratory, a sixth form block, an additional teaching space and a new science laboratory. The Anglo was in competition with the local grammar schools and was finding it hard to find enough pupils. The <b>European</b> <b>authority</b> declared the school was not viable but after local protests the Authority decided to establish this as a school with distinct European dimension.

5000|$|This {{testimony}} {{by the two}} Plymouth plantation leaders has been challenged by ethnologist Lynn Ceci in the late 20th century. She did not dispute that Squanto taught the early English settlers how to manure their corn crop with fish (which she conceded [...] "is an excellent fertilizer for corn") but rather that Squanto was teaching them an [...] "Indian" [...] technology, rather than one he acquired, during his years of bondage, from European sources. Her argument rests on (i) the conclusion that in places other than southern New England the condition for fish fertilization by natives did not exist and therefore was not a [...] "common and widespread practice {{in any part of}} Native North America," [...] (ii) the absence of English sources that attest to Native use of fish fertilizer (iii) that some early English settlers testified that they had not seen Natives use fertilizer and that they were [...] "too lazy to catch fish," [...] (iv) that fertilization was an [...] "advanced trait" [...] and one that was unnecessary (and overly burdensome given the manpower available to Native societies and their lack of draught animals) since Natives could simply leave their fields fallow as was observed by early explorers and (v) there is scattered <b>European</b> <b>authority</b> that shows that southern Europeans used marine fertilizers for crops and occasional examples of English use of fish fertilizer, one of which Squanto may have come into contact with. Various historians have disputed Ceci's analysis, arguing that she (i) ignored evidence pointing to the aboriginal origins of the fish fertilization practice; (ii) failed to consider the ulterior motives settlers had for denigrating native husbandry and work ethic; namely, that land-hungry settlers used the principle of vacuum domiciliun to claim that Natives never [...] "used" [...] their lands (in prescribed English manner) and therefore had no title, (iii) failed to consider the considerably greater pre-epidemic population which would have made changing plots (requiring tree-clearing) less easy {{and at the same time}} provided manpower for widespread fertilization when she speculated that it was easier for Natives to abandon established fields and obtain new ones. (iv) betrayed ignorance of the fact that the English had no draft animals or wagons until 1624, when she assumed that the English settlers could more easily fertilize fields because of the Indians lacked draft animals and even wagons, (v) ignored the fact that the Natives had more available manpower than the Plymouth settlers and produced crops of higher yield when she calculated the amount of labor required to fertilize, and (vi) did not consider the difference between native American agriculture and European (and even Newfoundland) farming (which did not grow maize and the famers did not plant seeds in mounds over fish deposited as manure) when reviewing the possible, but scanty, evidence of European fertilization by fish. An additional suggestive piece of evidence for aboriginal use of fish fertilizer is the use of the same Algonquian word for certain small fish and fertilizer. A recent writer who has reviewed all the literature has concluded that Ceci's claim has been [...] "authoritatively refuted." [...] However that dispute turns out, neither Ceci nor anyone else has ever challenged the facts that it was Squanto who showed the Plymouth settlers how to plant native foods, that his method yielded better results than their own planting of English crops and that Squanto's assistance was crucial to the fledgling settlement's survival during its first year.|$|E
