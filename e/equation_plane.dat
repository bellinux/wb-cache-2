40|$|International audienceThe {{propagation}} of finite amplitude sound waves is of fundamental interest in nonlinear acoustics. In the simplest model of propagation in fluids these waves are {{described by the}} well-known Burgers <b>equation</b> (<b>plane</b> waves).

In case of noise-type initial disturbance, the analytical calculation the velocity field is very complicated mathematical problem. The Fast Legendre Transform Algorithm should be applied to solve the problem. In the present paper we consider the numerical simulation of evolution of complex pulses which are characterized by two scales. For such signals the generation of a low-frequency component or a non-zero mean field takes place. It has also been shown that, for a pulse with random carrier, the parameters of the asymptotic waveform depend weakly on the fine structure of the initial pulse, but that the old-age behaviour is very sensitive to the properties of the carrier...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{construction}} and comprehensive electromagnetic {{analysis of a}} novel class of WLAN layouts is presented in this paper. The main purpose is to construct a wireless system according to the 802. 11 a/b/g standards, which enables significantly larger and more reliable data transfer rates, making use of a new large-scale field prediction technique, based on the parabolic equation with finite differences. Thus, four distinct structures, based on two different operating systems and two different hardware architectures, are proposed and elaborately examined. On the other hand, for the prediction algorithm a 3 D wide-angle parabolic equation scheme is devised and a recursive approximation of the forward wave equation is accomplished. Unlike existing methods that characterize obstacles by means of surface impedance boundary conditions, a more rigorous approach, by treating them as penetrable objects with known material features is utilized. In this manner, the “interface ” problem is systematically formulated {{and high levels of}} accuracy are attained. Moreover, the proposed technique is proven to be sufficiently faster and numerically more efficient, as the lattice, so constructed, along with the numbering of degrees of freedom remain unchanged from a parabolic <b>equation</b> <b>plane</b> to another. Extensive results and measurements certify the aforementioned merits for various realistic exterior and interior configurations...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the results}} of the thermo-elastic {{analysis}} performed on the stereo channel of the imaging system Integrated Observatory System for the BepiColombo European Space Agency mission to Mercury are presented. The aim of the work is {{to determine the effects of}} ambient parameter variations on the equipment performance; the optical performance is changing during the mission lifetime primarily because of the optics misalignments and deformations induced by temperature variations. The camera optics and their mountings are modeled and processed by a thermo-mechanical finite element model (FEM) program, which reproduces the expected optics and structure thermo-elastic deformations in the instrument foreseen operative temperature range, i. e., between − 20 °C and 30 °C. The FEM outputs are elaborated using a MATLAB optimization routine: an algorithm based on nonlinear least square data fitting is adopted to determine the surface <b>equation</b> (<b>plane,</b> spherical, nth polynomial) which best fits the deformed optical surfaces. The obtained surfaces are then directly imported into a ZEMAX code for sequential ray-tracing analysis.

40|$|Abstract. A {{class of}} {{differentiable}} solutions is proved for the isentropic Euler equations in three space dimensions. The solutions are explicitly given {{in terms of}} three solutions to the inviscid Burgers equation, and three directions of propagation. The relative orientation of the directions is critical. Within the directional constraints, the Burgers solutions are arbitrary. These solutions cannot exist beyond the time when shocks develop {{in any of the}} Burgers solutions. One example corresponds to the shallow water wave model. The solutions in this case show that three shallow water plane waves may evolve without interfering with each other, provided the angles between any two are exactly 120 degrees, until the time that one of them breaks. They are not solitons, since each evolves independently. Key words. Euler equations, Burgers <b>equation,</b> <b>plane</b> wave, isentropic, shock AMS subject classifications. 35 Q 31, 76 N 15 1.
