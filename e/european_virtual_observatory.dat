SIMBAD, VizieR, Aladin, and the ‘Dictionary of Nomenclature’, integrate heterogeneous, selected information from observatory archives, sky surveys and publications. Each service organizes information {{in a different way}} (astronomical objects, tables, images with overlays, nomenclature), and the CDS hub allows versatile information retrieval, e. g. looking for known information in a given region of the sky, including observations of ground- and space-based instruments, or searching by criteria in large data sets. Links among the CDS services, and with other reference on-line information systems, such as observatory and survey archives and publications, permit comprehensive searches {{in a wide variety of}} resources. Shared exchange standards and generic tools such as the GLU are essential for the building of links.

Recently, four institutes of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences launched a joint project called “Astroinformatics” and aimed at {{the development of the}} necessary methods and techniques. As a truly interdisciplinary area Astroinformatics has arisen from the need of ICT methods for preservation and exploitation of the scientific, cultural and historic heritage of astronomical observations. The Wide-Field Plate Data Base is an ICT project of the Institute of Astronomy, which has been launched in 1991, by the Working Group “Wide-Field Sky Surveys” of the International Astronomic Union (IAU) and is unique by its nature at the international level. So far 150, 000 plates have been already digitized through several European research programs. As a result, image-data is collected with about 2 TB size and it tends to rise up to 1 PB.
