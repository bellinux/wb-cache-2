500|$|There {{are other}} {{dimensions}} to the lyrics, with Gaga playing off her image of self-promotion and criticisms directed {{at her with}} the line [...] "I try to sell myself, but I am really laughing because I <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> music not the bling". In a review for Artpop, Simon Chandler from Tiny Mix Tapes gave {{a detailed analysis of}} the lyrical composition. According to him, Gaga wanted to portray her music as boundless in its meaning with [...] "Artpop", but it appeared to be arrogant since most of the conclusions derived about her music is from her public persona created and its media coverage. Chandler believed that the lyrics wanted to drive home a point about Gaga being the center for any discussion. With the previous lyrics, the implication is that Gaga's impassive personality utilizes her music to sell her brand name to the general crowd, and primarily fuels the public interest in her.|$|E
500|$|A President Aaron Bay-Schuck at Interscope Records asked songwriters and {{producers}} J.R. Rotem, Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels {{to work with}} Stefani on the album. Stefani recalled saying the following to them during a recording session: [...] "'Listen, I don’t care about anything. I don’t care about hits. I don’t care about anything except for coming in this room right now…all I {{want to do is}} just say the truth. I <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> truth to come out'." [...] Michaels, revealed that [...] "Gwen had written down of all of these things she was feeling at that moment. There was this one phrase that read, 'I don't know why I cry but I think it's because I remembered {{for the first time since}} I hated you that I used to love you.' I said, 'Whoa, what a crazy line that is.' She just goes, 'Cool, make it a melody. Let's go." [...] The song was written after Stefani was told by her label that the album was too personal to release; she rebelled against their advice and continued writing personal songs. The next day she ended up writing what she thought was the least commercial song on the album, [...] "Used to Love You", and they approved it.|$|E

He {{got out of his}} deal with Universal , which wasn’t a good situation for either of them,” revealed Dawson. “Him and I have an active producer agreement that is now null and void because they got caught in the legal shuffle, but I’m like, ‘I <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> music to come out. Let’s {{find a way to make}} it happen.’ I was emailing him stuff back and forth when I was [...] in Hawaii. Some big stuff will be coming out this next year, so I’m stoked to see it going.” Chamillionaire also tweeted that he’ll be doing a Ustream session on January 14 to discuss his future plans.|$|E

2500|$|... "Adieu" [...] ("Farewell"), is a 1960s-inspired pop song, {{featuring}} a double bassline and [...] "stomping" [...] percussion in the vein of Bo Diddley. It was released as the album's first single on September 19 and topped CBC Radio 3's The R3-30 singles chart for two consecutive weeks in November. Lyrically, [...] "Adieu" [...] deals with what Martin {{describes as the}} phase of [...] "the break-up where you really <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> other person to disappear... {{you want to stop}} thinking about them", though she also clarifies that [...] "it's a general break-up song, it doesn't talk about one person in particular". A music video for the song, directed by Jérémie Saindon, features Niels Schneider as Martin's boyfriend whose infidelity provokes her to enact revenge on his various partners, and eventually him as well. The concept was inspired by the 1960s sitcom Bewitched and styled with touches of both retro and modern.|$|E

[...] In {{an interview with the}} Jewish Telegraph, Hafeez said: [...] "It's not about being pro-Israel or pro-truth, I <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> facts to be heard. Israel is a democratic state. Muslims in Israel have more rights than possibly most Muslims in the Arab world {{and then there is the}} reality of the actual conflict.

You'd better take an axe with you to open their skulls; there is no other way." [...] How this legend started I don't know, but I think it is because the English are jealous of the Scotch. They got into the Union with them in 1707 and they can't get out. The Scotch don't want Home Rule, or Swa Raj, or Dominion status, or anything; they <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>the</b> English. When they want money they go to London and make it; if they want {{literary}} fame they sell their books to the English; and to prevent any kind of political trouble they take care to keep the Cabinet well filled with Scotchmen. The English for shame's sake can't get out of the Union, so they retaliate by saying that the Scotch have no sense of humour. But there's nothing in it.
