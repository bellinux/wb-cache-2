5|$|Michael J. Fox was {{the first}} choice to play Marty McFly, but he was {{committed}} to the show <b>Family</b> <b>Ties.</b> <b>Family</b> <b>Ties</b> producer Gary David Goldberg felt that Fox was essential to the show's success. With co-star Meredith Baxter on maternity leave, he refused to allow Fox time off {{to work on a}} film. Back to the Future was originally scheduled for a May 1985 release and it was late 1984 when it was learned that Fox would be unable to star in the film. Zemeckis' next two choices were C. Thomas Howell and Eric Stoltz. Stoltz impressed the producers enough with his earlier portrayal of Roy L. Dennis in Mask (which had yet to be released) that they selected him to play Marty McFly. Because of the difficult casting process, the start date was pushed back twice.|$|E
5|$|The Convention delegates were {{a younger}} {{generation}} raised in the Second American Party System of Democrat Jefferson Davis and Whig Henry Clay. Unlike the three generation Convention of 1829–30, the delegates were primarily in their twenties and thirties {{at the beginning of}} their careers in the professions and industry, without large land holdings, and without gentry <b>family</b> <b>ties.</b>|$|E
5|$|The gods' complex {{characteristics}} were expressed in myths and in intricate relationships between deities: <b>family</b> <b>ties,</b> loose groups and hierarchies, and combinations of separate gods into one. Deities' diverse appearances in art—as animals, humans, objects, and combinations of different forms—also alluded, through symbolism, to their essential features.|$|E
50|$|Fabio Buzzi {{was born}} in Lecco in 1943, from a <b>family</b> <b>tied</b> for centuries {{to the art of}} {{building}} and design.|$|R

60|$|He {{spoke in}} short half {{sentences}} of intense feeling, and Mrs. Edmonstone was much moved by such affection in one {{said to have}} been treated with an excess of strictness, much compassionating the lonely boy, who had lost every <b>family</b> <b>tie</b> in one.|$|R
5|$|In December, Kan Ek' {{despatched}} AjChan {{to negotiate}} peace with Spain, with three Itza companions. They were accompanied to Mérida {{by a small}} number of Mopans from the Tipuj region. AjChan, through <b>family</b> <b>ties</b> and marriage, had a key role as a middleman between the Itza, Yalain and Kowoj; he also had <b>family</b> <b>ties</b> with the semi-Christianised Maya at Tipuj, and his mother was from Chichen Itza in the northern Yucatán. His marriage to a Kowoj woman had been an attempt, ultimately unsuccessful, to defuse Itza–Kowoj hostility. Kan Ek' sent AjChan to Mérida with a message of peaceful submission to the Spanish Empire in an attempt to solidify his own position as sole ruler of the Itza, even if this meant sacrificing Itza independence from Spain. The Itza king's uncle and the Kowoj were fundamentally opposed to any negotiations with the Spanish and viewed AjChan's embassy as treachery. The Spanish were unaware of the tensions between different Maya factions in central Petén, which by now had escalated into a state of inter-Maya warfare. AjChan was baptised as Martín Francisco on 31 December 1695, with Martín de Ursúa, governor of Yucatán, acting as his godfather.|$|E
5|$|Nauru {{does not}} have any formal {{structure}} for political parties, and candidates typically stand for office as independents; fifteen of the 19members of the current Parliament are independents. Four parties that have been active in Nauruan politics are the Nauru Party, the Democratic Party, Nauru First, and the Centre Party. However, alliances within the government are often formed on the basis of extended <b>family</b> <b>ties</b> rather than party affiliation.|$|E
5|$|Although Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter, was {{of royal}} blood, he was {{commonly}} {{viewed as a}} criminal, prone to violence and stupidity. A proven enemy of the Nevilles, Exeter bore a grudge particularly against Warwick for displacing him from his hereditary role of Lord High Admiral in 1457. Nonetheless, when Warwick joined the Lancastrians, Exeter obeyed Margaret and served under the Earl during the invasion of England. Although he supported the Lancastrian cause, Exeter had <b>family</b> <b>ties</b> to the House of York; he was husband to Anne of York, Edward's sister.|$|E
5000|$|Palmerston North Boys' High School {{is divided}} into six 'clubs'. On {{enrolment}} students are placed in a club at random, or into {{a house with a}} <b>family</b> <b>tie</b> (the same as his brothers, father, grandfather or uncles). Staff are also placed in clubs, {{with the exception of the}} Rector.|$|R

50|$|His heraldic {{career was}} started {{thanks to his}} <b>family's</b> <b>ties</b> to Sir Nicholas Bacon. On 18 July 1618, Chitting was {{appointed}} Chester Herald of Arms in Ordinary after purchasing the position from his predecessor. In this capacity he visited Berkshire and Gloucestershire in 1623 for William Camden, Clarenceux King of Arms.|$|R
5|$|Deligiannis mobilized the Hellenic Army, and the British Royal Navy {{blockaded}} Greece. The admiral {{in charge}} of the blockade was Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, who had been the first choice of the Greeks to be their king in 1863, and the First Lord of the Admiralty at the time was Lord Ripon, whose brother-in-law had been murdered in Greece 16 years before. This was not the last time that King George discovered that his <b>family</b> <b>ties</b> were not always to his advantage. Deligiannis was forced to demobilize and Trikoupis regained the premiership. Between 1882 and 1897, Trikoupis and Deligiannis alternated the premiership as their fortunes rose and fell.|$|E
5|$|During {{high school}} and college, Shehri was deeply {{religious}} and attended Al-Seqley Mosque, which his family had built as the local mosque. Shehri also frequented government-supported religious camps in Saudi Arabia. At this time, there were strong religious feelings in Saudi Arabia, especially in the Asir region. Many {{young people in the}} region idolized Osama bin Laden, who had <b>family</b> <b>ties</b> to the area. Wail's father was a friend of Bin Laden's father, Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden. Ahmed al-Nami and Saeed al-Ghamdi, who were both hijackers on United Airlines Flight 93, came from the same area in Saudi Arabia as the Shehri family.|$|E
5|$|It is {{uncertain}} as to exactly why John emigrated to Serbia instead of assuming a high-ranking position in Bulgaria, as his ancestry and <b>family</b> <b>ties</b> would suggest. Bulgarian historian Ivan Bozhilov {{is of the}} opinion that John was not seeking political refuge in Serbia. Instead, it is most likely that he moved to that country with the belief that Serbia's territorial expansion and political influence in that period would secure him better career opportunities. Presumably, John accompanied his sister Helena when she moved to Serbia to marry Stephen Dušan in 1332.|$|E
50|$|He {{married his}} niece, Margravine Elisabeth Louise of Brandenburg-Schwedt, on 27 September 1755. She was a {{daughter}} of his older sister Sophia Dorothea and her husband Margrave Frederick William of Brandenburg-Schwedt. Despite this <b>family</b> <b>tie,</b> she was only eight years younger than he, due to the significant age difference {{between him and his}} sister.|$|R
25|$|The {{group is}} so angular, so Cubist, so ugly {{according}} to accepted notions, that few look {{long enough to}} see what the sculptor means; yet strange as the group was it undeniably gave a powerful impression of the binding, the blending character of the <b>family</b> <b>tie,</b> a much more powerful impression than groups in conventional academic pose could give.|$|R
5000|$|Daddy: Mama's {{deceased}} husband; Sassafrass, Cypress, and Indigo's father. Although Daddy {{is already}} {{dead at the}} start of the novel, he maintains a strong presence in the family's home life and serves as Mama's confidante, strengthening the <b>family's</b> <b>ties</b> to more spirit-filled worlds. Notably, his distinct absence allows the family's home to be a strictly female space.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Black Hawk {{learned that}} the Ho-Chunk and Potawatomi tribes were less {{supportive}} than anticipated. As in other tribes, different bands of these tribes often pursued different policies. The Ho-Chunks who lived along the Rock River in Illinois had <b>family</b> <b>ties</b> to the Sauks; they cautiously supported the British Band while trying not to provoke the Americans. Ho-Chunks in Wisconsin were more divided. Some bands, remembering their loss to the Americans in the 1827 Winnebago War, decided to stay clear of the conflict. Other Ho-Chunks with ties to the Dakotas and Menominees, most notably Waukon Decorah and his brothers, were eager {{to fight against the}} British Band.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side is her uncle, King Leopold I of the Belgians, who wishes to use his {{influence}} through <b>family</b> <b>ties</b> to secure an alliance between Britain and his kingdom. He decides to have his nephew Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha seduce Victoria and he is coached in her likes and dislikes. The Duchess invites the Coburg brothers, Albert and Prince Ernest of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, to visit the household. Victoria and Albert develop an early fondness for each other, despite Victoria knowing that Albert was sent by their uncle to win her favours. They begin writing to one another after Albert returns home.|$|E
5|$|Riel was {{the eldest}} of eleven {{children}} in a locally well-respected family. His father, who was of Franco-Ojibwa Métis descent, had gained prominence in this community by organizing a group that supported Guillaume Sayer, a Métis imprisoned for challenging the HBC's historical trade monopoly. Sayer's eventual release due to agitations by Louis Sr.'s group effectively ended the monopoly, and the name Riel was therefore {{well known in the}} Red River area. His mother was the daughter of Jean-Baptiste Lagimodière and Marie-Anne Gaboury, one of the earliest white families to settle in the Red River Settlement in 1812. The Riels were noted for their devout Catholicism and strong <b>family</b> <b>ties.</b>|$|E
5|$|Overmars {{was born}} in Emst, Gelderland, growing up on a family farm with his parents and {{assisting}} his grandfather with the potato harvest each year. There were no machines or tractors, so {{when the time came}} to extract the potatoes, his <b>family</b> <b>tied</b> a rope around Overmars' waist, connected it to a cart and made him run while they pulled the crop out.|$|R
50|$|The league had a fluid structure, but {{its members}} shared some characteristics; {{most of the}} Hansa cities either started as {{independent}} cities or gained independence through the collective bargaining power of the league, though such independence remained limited. The Hanseatic free cities owed allegiance directly to the Holy Roman Emperor, without any intermediate <b>family</b> <b>tie</b> of obligation to the local nobility.|$|R

5|$|Robert Zemeckis, the director, {{originally}} wanted Fox to play Marty, but Gary David Goldberg {{the creator}} of <b>Family</b> <b>Ties,</b> which Fox was working on at the time, refused to allow Zemeckis even to approach Fox as he felt that as Meredith Baxter was on maternity leave at the time, Fox's character Alex Keaton was needed to carry the show in her absence. Eric Stoltz was cast and was already filming Back to the Future, but Zemeckis felt that Stoltz was not giving the right type of performance for the humor involved. Zemeckis quickly replaced Stoltz with Fox, whose schedule was now more open {{with the return of}} Meredith Baxter. He was considered for the role of Mark Kendall in Once Bitten, but it eventually went to Jim Carrey. During filming, Fox would rehearse for <b>Family</b> <b>Ties</b> from 10 a.m to 6 p.m, then rush to the Back to the Future set where he would rehearse and shoot until 2:30a.m. This schedule lasted for two full months. Back to the Future was both a commercial and critical success. The film spent 8 consecutive weekends as the number-one grossing movie at the US box office in 1985 and eventually earned a worldwide total of $381.11 million. Variety applauded the performances, stating that Fox and his co-star Christopher Lloyd imbued Marty and Doc Brown's friendship with a quality reminiscent of King Arthur and Merlin. The film was later followed by two similarly-successful sequels, Back to the Future Part II (1989) and Back to the Future Part III (1990).|$|E
5|$|Soon after Berkman turned 12, {{his father}} died. The {{business}} {{had to be}} sold, and the family lost the right to live in Saint Petersburg. Yetta moved the family to Kovno, where her brother Nathan lived. Berkman had shown great promise {{as a student at}} the gymnasium, but his studies began to falter as he spent his time reading novels. One of the books that interested him was Ivan Turgenev's novel Fathers and Sons (1862), with its discussion of nihilist philosophy. But what truly moved him was Nikolay Chernyshevsky's 1863 novel, What Is to Be Done?, and Berkman felt inspired by Rakhmetov, its puritanical protagonist who is willing to sacrifice personal pleasure and <b>family</b> <b>ties</b> in single-minded pursuit of his revolutionary aims.|$|E
5|$|Stela 11 was {{originally}} an interior column from Temple 18, the funerary shrine of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat. When it was found, {{it was broken}} in two parts {{at the base of}} the temple. It portrays the king as the elderly Maya maize god and has imagery that seems to deliberately parallel the tomb lid of the Palenque king K'inich Janaab' Pakal, probably because of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat's close <b>family</b> <b>ties</b> to that city. The text of the column formed part of a longer text carved onto the interior walls of the temple and may describe the downfall of the Copán dynasty.|$|E
50|$|PCT {{recognized}} {{the existence of}} cognitive schema or mental models that employees and employers use in interacting with each other. The psychological contract is a system of beliefs an individual holds regarding an exchange arrangement with another (e.g., employment, customer/supplier relationship, <b>family</b> <b>tie</b> or marriage). A fundamental feature of the psychological contract is that like cognitive schemata generally, the contract, once established, is relatively resistant to change.|$|R
50|$|Two {{years after}} his father's death in 1675 his mother {{remarried}} Garrett Dillon, a prominent Roman Catholic barrister who under the Catholic King James II of England rose to power, and was appointed Recorder of Dublin. Garrett and his stepson {{seem to have been}} estranged {{by the time of the}} Glorious Revolution, and Susanna's death before 1689 broke any close <b>family</b> <b>tie</b> between them.|$|R
5000|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Christopher's origin, date of birth or death. He is {{identified}} in the sources as the gambros of Emperor Basil I the Macedonian (r. 867-886), a word which usually means [...] "son-in-law", but can imply a more general <b>family</b> <b>tie</b> through marriage. Cyril Mango suggested that Christopher married Basil's eldest daughter, Anastasia, but all the emperor's daughters were eventually confined to a convent.|$|R
5|$|The Darwins had ten children: two died in infancy, and Annie's {{death at}} the age of ten had a devastating effect on her parents. Charles was a devoted father and uncommonly {{attentive}} to his children. Whenever they fell ill, he feared that they might have inherited weaknesses from inbreeding due to the close <b>family</b> <b>ties</b> he shared with his wife and cousin, Emma Wedgwood. He examined this topic in his writings, contrasting it with the advantages of crossing amongst many organisms. Despite his fears, most of the surviving children and many of their descendants went on to have distinguished careers (see Darwin-Wedgwood family).|$|E
5|$|The Netherlands {{provided}} William Bruce {{with many}} of his influences. He was in the Low Countries {{at a time when}} Italian Classicism was the height of fashion, and similarities have been observed between Bruce's work, particularly Holyroodhouse, and such buildings as the Amsterdam City Hall (1648–65), the work of Jacob van Campen, and Maastricht's City Hall (1659–64), by Pieter Post. Alexander Bruce had married a Dutch woman with <b>family</b> <b>ties</b> to the House of Orange, and it seems likely that he provided links to the Dutch artisans who worked on some of Bruce's projects.|$|E
5|$|The {{interpersonal}} {{conflicts and}} feuds {{leading to the}} gunfight were complex. Each side had strong <b>family</b> <b>ties.</b> The brothers James, Virgil, Wyatt, Morgan, and Warren Earp were a tight-knit family, working together as pimps, lawmen, and saloon owners in several frontier towns, among other occupations, and had moved together from one town to another. Virgil served in the Union Army during the American Civil War and in 1877 became {{a police officer in}} Prescott, Arizona. He followed that with a job as a night watchman before he became a constable. Wyatt had held two jobs as a police officer in the cattle-drive towns of Wichita and Dodge City, Kansas.|$|E
5000|$|In 1276 Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Prince of Wales, {{also known}} as Llywelyn the Last, seized the town, declaring it a [...] "free borough" [...] {{independent}} from the diocese of Llanelwy. Although the bishop {{went as far as}} to seek the help of the Pope to overturn this, his attempts failed, Llywelyn pleading a close <b>family</b> <b>tie</b> to the place as a reason for safeguarding it.|$|R
50|$|There is {{also some}} {{confusion}} on {{his name and}} divergence among names used by scholars. He had the same name as his son, Gümüştekin. The father {{is often referred to}} shortly as Danishmend Gazi, while his son is called Emir Gazi, without mentioning the name Gümüştekin common to both. Furthermore, the Danishmend dynasty is also cited as having a <b>family</b> <b>tie</b> to the Seljuk dynasty although the explanations differ.|$|R
