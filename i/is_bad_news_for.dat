40|$|Over {{the last}} four decades the {{literature}} on bond rating changes and its effects on security prices increased significantly with almost all studies not controlling for the respective reason for those. We therefore investigate the impact of rating events on the stock and the credit default swap (CDS) market incorporating rating reviews and rating changes together with the reason mentioned by the rating agency. Our results for the general effects are in line with prior findings but conditioning on the respective reason shows that the markets’ anticipation of rating actions is largely driven by events due to changes in firms’ operating performance. Furthermore, we provide empirical evidence for the hypothesis in prior literature that a surprise downgrade does not necessarily have to <b>be</b> <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> <b>for</b> stockholders when wealth is transferred from bondholders, but negative rating actions <b>are</b> always <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> <b>for</b> bondholders.

50|$|Jaihind is {{the journey}} of five people, linked by one man, who fights for children's rights to education. Parvathi (Yuvina Parthavi), from a very poor family background, gets an {{admission}} {{into one of the}} most affluent schools in the city, but unable to pay the exorbitant fees, the man of the house sells one of his kidneys. They still fall short of a big chunk of money and they finally give up and commit suicide. This disturbs Abhimanyu (Arjun Sarja) deeply, and the computer service engineer becomes a hero over night, by propagandizing a solution for education costing so much. Abhimanyu suggests that all private schools be nationalised, which will compel them to offer services at very little fees compared to that being collected now, while still ensuring that the quality of education is not compromised. This <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> <b>for</b> the private school owners, who make a business out of educating children. And hence Abhimanyu is targeted and pushed to extremes. He is put behind bars and is conspired to be murdered. How he succeeds in his mission, despite all this, forms the crux of the movie.|$|E
50|$|A pore in a microstructure, unless desired, <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> <b>for</b> the properties. In fact, {{in nearly}} all of the materials, a pore will be the {{starting}} point for the rupture of the material. It is the initiation point for the cracks. Furthermore, a pore is usually quite hard to get rid of. Those techniques described later involve a high temperature process. However, even those processes can sometimes make the pore even bigger. Pores with large coordination number (surrounded by many particles) tend to grow during the thermal process. This is caused by the thermal energy being converted to a driving force for the growth of the particles which will induce the growth of the pore as the high coordination number prohibits the growth towards the pore.For many materials, it can be seen from their phase diagram that multiple phases can exist at the same time. Those different phases might exhibit different crystal structure, thus exhibiting different mechanical properties. Furthermore, these different phases also exhibit a different microstructure (grain size, orientation). This can also improve some mechanical properties as crack deflection can occur, thus pushing the ultimate breakdown further as it creates a more tortuous crack path in the coarser microstructure.|$|E
5000|$|Among {{seasonal}} allergies, {{there are}} some allergens that fuse together and produce {{a new type of}} allergy. For instance, grass pollen allergens cross-react with food allergy proteins in vegetables such as onion, lettuce, carrots, celery and corn. Besides, the cousins of birch pollen allergens, like apples, grapes, peaches, celery and apricots, produce severe itching in the ears and throat. The cypress pollen allergy brings a cross reactivity between diverse species like olive, privet, ash and Russian olive tree pollen allergens. In some rural areas there is another form of seasonal grass allergy, combining airborne particles of pollen mixed with mold. Recent research has suggested that humans might develop allergies as a defense to fight off parasites. According to Yale University Immunologist Dr Ruslan Medzhitov, protease allergens cleave the same sensor proteins that evolved to detect proteases produced by the parasitic worms. Additionally, a new report on seasonal allergies called “Extreme allergies and Global Warming”, have found that many allergy triggers are worsening due to climate change. 16 states in the United States were named as “Allergen Hotspots” for large increases in allergenic tree pollen if global warming pollution keeps increasing. Therefore, researchers on this report claimed that global warming <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> <b>for</b> millions of asthmatics in the United States whose asthma attacks are triggered by seasonal allergies. [...] Indeed, seasonal allergies are one of the main triggers for asthma, along with colds or flu, cigarette smoke and exercise. In Canada, for example, up to 75% of asthmatics also have seasonal allergies.|$|E

5000|$|Sterelny then {{outlines}} {{in chapter}} 8 Gould and Eldredge's punctuated equilibrium hypothesis. They {{argued that the}} appearance of stability in species evolution is not a mere effect of the gappiness and imperfection of the fossil record. Rather, it {{is the result of}} discontinuous tempos of change in the process of speciation and the deployment of species in geological time.Sterelny notes that this hypothesis has been misunderstood in two important ways. First, in some early discussions of the idea, the contrast between geological and ecological time was blurred, with Gould and Eldredge interpreted as claiming that species originate more or less overnight in a single step. However, Gould and Eldredge were referring to geological time, in which speciation taking 50,000 years would seem instantaneous relative to a species existence over millions of years. A second misunderstanding relates to further evolutionary change following speciation. They are not claiming that there is no generational change at all. [...] "Lineages do change. But the change between generations does not accumulate. Instead, over time, the species wobbles about its phenotypic mean. Jonathan Weiner's The Beak of the Finch describes this very process." [...] (p. 96) Sterelny notes that {{despite the fact that the}} fossil record represents, for several reasons, a biased sample, [...] "the consensus seems to be shifting Gould's way: the punctuated equilibrium pattern is common, perhaps even predominant". Yet even if stasis is common [...] "why suppose that this <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> <b>for</b> the extrapolationist orthodoxy?" [...] (p. 97) He notes that [...] "the problem is not stasis but speciation. How can events in a local population generate a new species?" [...] (p. 98) In discussing this issue, he notes [...] "any solution to the speciation problem will take us beyond events in local populations observable on human timescales", and [...] "it is likely that whatever explains the occasional transformation of a population into a species will rely on large-scale but rare climatic, biological, geographic or geological events; events which isolate populations until local change is entrenched". (p. 99) He notes that speciation is not just the accumulation of events in a local population, but dependent on the population's embeddedness into a larger whole. [...] "There is a break with a strong version of extrapolationism, but it is not a radical break. Dawkins could, should, and probably would accept it; in The Ancestor's Tale, he has an inclusive view of speciation mechanisms." [...] (p. 100) Thus, while [...] "Gould somewhat overstates the adherence of orthodoxy to strict extrapolationism", punctuated equilibrium is more important than some of the more [...] "ungenerous treatment" [...] that has been meted out.
