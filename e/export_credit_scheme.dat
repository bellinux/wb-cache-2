40|$|M. Com. (Economic Management) South Africa, as a {{developing}} country, {{has an enormous}} need for capital. Between 1980 to 1983, an amount of RBO billion was spent on fixed capital investment alone in this country. A large component of this investment originates from external sources and was financed by way of off-shore loans and other credit facilities. The developed countries, {{in order to promote}} their exports, have long realised that in addition to offering a competitive price and high quality product, competition also required that credit be made available to the importer. Presently the competition between the leading export countries result in the development of subsidised <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> <b>schemes</b> to promote the sale of industrial machinery and equipment. In cases where the fixed export finance rate is lower than market rates, Governments make up the difference between the export finance rate and commercial lending rates. Normally a fixed interest rate for the credit period is available in the exporter's currency. An important consideration when borrowing overseas, is the foreign currency exposure. With continuous fluctuations in the value of currencies the borrower is faced with a foreign exchange risk. This risk can be partially eliminated by hedging on the forward exchange market. In this study an analysis was made of the most important <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> <b>schemes</b> as well as the possible influence of forward exchange considerations. An importer has the option to also make use imported capital goods.

40|$|<b>Export</b> <b>Credit</b> Agencies (ECAs) {{play a role}} {{of central}} {{importance}} in international trade and investment flows. ECAs are {{a vital part of}} the infrastructure supporting trade and have often been considered to be a critical component in a nation's export-led growth strategy. The basic role of an ECA is to support and encourage exports and outward investment by insuring international trade and investment transactions and, in some cases, providing finance directly. One of the most common and most challenging problems that ECAs face is what to do about small exporters. Small exporters are a significant and politically sensitive subject in most countries for various reasons and not necessarily because they make a substantial or potentially substantial contribution to total exports. Facilities tailored to small exporters may be costly to operate largely because of diseconomies of scale: administrative costs per contract may be as high as those for larger exporters, yet income per contract is likely to be lower. The International Financial Institutions (IFIs) have played an increasingly active role in the area of <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance and finance, but the extent and nature has varied significantly between individual IFIs. Helping to establish and support an ECA in the difficult early days has been recognized as an important role for IFIs. Moreover, IFIs can play a part in helping to address gaps in the availability of trade finance and working capital -especially for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) - which can exist and which can be helped by trade facilitation arrangements of various kinds. IFIs have been active in developing programs to assist in national and regional trade development and facilitation efforts. Access to and availability of appropriate financial tools, including <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> facilities, have been components of some of these efforts. IFIs, even with their relatively modest involvement in supporting the <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> field, have taken a variety of different approaches. With trade a key agenda item for IFIs, it seems inevitable that there will be a continuing and even growing focus on trade finance systems, including <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> <b>schemes.</b> Looking at the experience of other IFIs, it seems that the most successful facilities and initiatives were designed to meet specific rather than general objectives problems; and worked with existing market practices and documentation and did not seek to reinvent mechanisms or to apply unduly complicated documentation or practices...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to show not only how <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> {{insurance}} <b>schemes</b> may offset the credit risks of the individual exporter and promote a revival of trade, but, also, in what manner such schemes under government sponsorship may become concealed political mechanisms that distort the pattern of trade to serve nationalistic ends.

However, while some low-income countries can rely on a specific exception on the prohibition on export subsidies, all WTO Members can, {{on the basis of}} the Illustrative List of Export Subsidies, justify certain subsidized <b>export</b> <b>credits</b> that are in accordance with the interest rate provisions of the OECD Arrangement. But, as the case law and the OECD Arrangement currently stand, subsidized <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> guarantees and insurance as well as subsidized short-term <b>export</b> <b>credits</b> cannot rely on this safe haven. Hence, the article shows that <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> agencies, except for those of some low-income countries, cannot play a complementary role to the private market in offering such support. Moreover, this contribution demonstrates that <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> support in accordance with the safe haven might still be countervailable and actionable.

40|$|The use of officially {{supported}} <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> programs {{for agricultural products}} has been a widely debated issue at the World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations in recent years.

In light of this debate, we analyze the impact of a reduction in the repayment period to 180 days on importing countries and examine the subsequent effects on U.

However, the benefits are reduced when the <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> repayment period is limited to 180 days.

40|$|Companies face various risks when {{participating}} in international business. Even though exporting {{has been argued}} to represent low level of international commitment, exporters still face more risks in comparison to companies with purely domestic business activities. Among different risks lies credit risk which refers to possible non-payment or late payment of a customer. While exporters’ credit management is responsible for controlling credit risk, credit management in an international environment requires exporters to cope with incomplete information about customers’ creditworthiness and risks related to customers’ home countries. Even though there are various ways to conduct credit management, exporters may choose to acquire <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance to support their credit management practices. By acquiring <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance, exporters can hedge credit risk to credit insurers. This mitigates exporters’ {{exposure to credit risk}} if their customers fail to pay for purchased goods or services i. e. in case when credit risk realizes. This study explored exporters’ views on the value that <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance provides for credit management practices. In this study, value refers to the benefit or benefits that <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance provides. Theoretical background of the study includes literature relating to themes such as <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance, credit management and risks related to internationalization. The study applied a qualitative research approach through five expert interviews from two Finnish exporters and one private <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurer. Expert interviews were considered as the most suitable method to collect data in order to create in-depth understanding of an underresearched topic, compare interviewees’ perceptions with current literature as well as to reveal new perceptions towards the value that <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance provides for exporters and their credit management. Based on the existing literature and empirical research, it can be concluded that exporters see that <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance provides value mainly through risk transfer. Risk transfer may also enable exporters to gain additional benefits such as expanding export sales to destinations where they have not sold before. In addition, <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance can enable exporters to outsource a part of their credit management to credit insurers and to provide clear guidelines for exporters that have sufficient resources for independent credit management practices. On the contrary, it seems that exporters’ value perceptions towards <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance are dependent on the extent of insurance coverage that exporters have for their customer base. At the same time, exporters may easily question the premise of <b>export</b> <b>credit</b> insurance if the level of customer non-payments is low...|$|R
