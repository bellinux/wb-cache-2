500|$|There is much {{agreement}} among historians and analysts that Lansbury was never self-serving and, guided by his Christian socialist principles, was consistent {{in his efforts}} on behalf of the poorest in society. [...] Shepherd believes that [...] "there could have been no better leader for the Labour Party at the collapse of its political fortunes in 1931 than Lansbury, a universally popular choice and a source of inspiration among Labour ranks". In the House of Commons on 8 May 1940, the day following Lansbury's death, Chamberlain said of him: [...] "There were not many hon. Members who felt convinced of the practicability of the methods which he advocated for the preservation of peace, but there was no one who did not realise his intense conviction, which arose out of his deep humanitarianism". Attlee also paid tribute to his former leader: [...] "He hated cruelty, injustice and wrongs, and felt deeply for all who suffered... e was ever the champion of the weak, and... {{to the end of his}} life he strove <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> which he believed".|$|E
500|$|Chris Stamp {{designed}} {{the cover of}} the UK version of Are You Experienced, which featured a picture of Hendrix, Mitchell, and Redding by Bruce Fleming. The image shows Hendrix wearing a long dark cape while standing over Mitchell and Redding, striking what Egan described as a [...] "Dracula-esque pose". Chandler contacted Fleming based on the photographer's previous work with the Hollies, the Dave Clark Five, and the Animals. The photo shoot took place in February after Fleming had attended several recording sessions and Experience gigs. Chandler made a point of requesting that the band member's faces be clearly visible in the photograph; Fleming explained: [...] " [...] got much more esoteric as time went on, but to establish the artist we had to get their faces across so the kids would recognize them." [...] He took monochrome and color shots of the band; Track selected an image from the latter group. Fleming had indicated which picture he preferred they use, marking the shot with a cross, but after the album's release he realized that they had selected another, less desirable image. According to Fleming, the shot that he chose was [...] "more sinister; more interesting". Stamp hired graphic artist Alan Aldridge to design the sleeve's psychedelic lettering. Track inexplicably put only the album's title on the cover, omitting the band's name; Polydor issued the release throughout Europe with Hendrix's name printed at the top in matching font. The cover art's combination of dull green and brown tones, juxtaposed with the jocular nature of the subject's pose, created a weak overall visual impression; Stamp commented: [...] "It's not a great cover at all. Hopefully, we made up <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> all the other covers." ...|$|E

The first direct link between Wellington and Asia proves that direct links are commercially viable, and furthers the case for a runway extension. The 777-200 is able to use Wellington Airport because the fuel needed to fly between Wellington and Canberra is relatively small; it couldn't takeoff from Wellington Airport if it carried the fuel required to fly non-stop to Singapore. The Deputy Mayor of Wellington believes Singapore Airlines' commitment to the capital helps the case for an airport runway extension, and that it shows airlines are looking to fly to Wellington and the extension will cater <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the future.|$|E

She did not at first feel able to sing the soprano part in Elijah, which he had written for her. She finally did so at a performance in London's Exeter Hall in late 1848, which raised £1,000 to fund a musical scholarship as a memorial to him; it was her first appearance in oratorio. The original intention had been to found a school of music in Mendelssohn's name in Leipzig, but {{there was not enough}} support <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> Leipzig, {{and with the help of}} Sir George Smart, Julius Benedict and others, Lind eventually raised enough money to fund a scholarship [...] "to receive pupils of all nations and promote their musical training".

2500|$|He {{maintained}} that God {{was always a}} creator, {{and there was not}} a time when he was non-creative (u-rā ṣonʿ nabud) before He turned into being creative. [...] According to him, it is requisite that He always be creator, then it is necessary <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> which His creation appeared to be eternal (qadim). [...] His creation makes its appearance (padid-āyanda ast) in Matter (hayulā), and therefore, Matter, a sign of the apparent power of God, is eternal; and since Matter, which is eternal, requires the existence of Space (makān), it follows that Space should be eternal too. [...] His ideas on time were that [...] time, world, and duration (zamān dahr wa moddat) are names whose meanings are derived from the same substance (jawhar). [...] He also philosophized that Time, a substance in motion and restless (jawhar-e ravanda wa biqarār), is the sign of God’s knowledge, {{in the same way that}} Space is the sign of His power; motion is the sign of His action, and the being (jesm) is the sign of His ability, and every one of these signs is infinite and eternal.|$|E

Republic of Macedonia's new name negotiator Zoran Jolevski told the mediator and the Greek negotiator that if the Republic of Macedonia would receive a NATO membership invitation at the Alliance's next summit in April, this would be positive for the name talks. One week before the fresh name talks, Macedonian foreign minister Antonio Milošoski told German newspaper [...] "die Tageszeitung" [...] that a solution could be found [...] "only on bilateral basis".

2500|$|The {{spread of}} {{partnership}} minyanim, according to Kaplowitz, {{does not follow}} a pattern based on proportionality to size of Orthodox populations. Rather, there are certain regions with clusters and other places with none at all. In his 2008 thesis, he noted: [...] "The Los Angeles area, with around two times as many Jews as the Chicago area, has one partnership minyan to Chicago’s three; Southeast Florida, with about twice as many Jews as Chicago, has none. [...] New Haven has a partnership minyan, but Philadelphia, with around twelve times as many Jews, does not. Ann Arbor has a partnership minyan but neither Detroit, Cleveland, nor Baltimore, each with over twelve times as many Jews, does (United Jewish Communities, 2002). [...] In fact, {{it is worth noting}} that there are no partnership minyanim in the Sunbelt except <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> Los Angeles; none west of the Atlantic seaboard and east of Michigan; and only one west of Chicago." [...] In his research of this sprawl, Kaplowitz concluded that this is because the partnership minyan is a culture that is transferred one person at a time. The culture does not spread evenly; it spreads when one activist moves and decides to lead the new community towards change. The culture is carried by individuals who have developed an unwavering commitment to the model. In other words, the culture of partnership minyan is spreading because Orthodox people who participate in these kinds of prayer services often find that they can no longer be part of Orthodox services where women are relegated to [...] "traditional" [...] roles.|$|E
