40|$|World Surface {{temperatures}} {{have increased}} 20 {{times faster than}} they rose {{at the end of}} the last ice age, and they will continue to rise due to the volume of greenhouse gases already released into the troposphere. This paper explores the damage done to building occupants as widespread sealing is carried out for energy-efficient buildings in a warming world, with reduced ventilation to a point where toxic moulds <b>grow</b> <b>in</b> <b>houses</b> and offices and occupants develop sick-building-syndrome symptoms. Tools are also discussed to assist designers in accommodating rising indoor temperatures, and novel approaches are considered to improve ventilation, particularly providing guidance on the specific air gust frequency for increased cooling at low power...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We examine {{interactions}} among explicit and implicit contracting practices for {{a sample of}} 385 intermediaries in California fruit and vegetable markets. Explicit practices are measured with an indicator {{for the existence of}} a formal contract, and with indicators for various contract specifications (e. g., target delivery date, volume, acreage). Implicit practices are measured directly with a question about the existence of an “implicit understanding, ” and indirectly with questions about the extent of informal involvement in farm-level decision making. Firms that manufacture processed foods, and that <b>grow</b> <b>in</b> <b>house</b> a portion of their total farm input, are significantly more likely to report use of explicit and implicit contracting practices. Additionally, unobserved factors that influence the use of explicit and implicit contracting are positively correlated. These findings suggest a complementary relationship between formal and informal contracts...|$|R
