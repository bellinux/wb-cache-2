The Living Girdle was advertised with images of mobility and comfort, such as women playing tennis or leaping while wearing it, though the solid rubber girdle was actually very uncomfortable.|$|E
5|$|The British {{army was}} {{defeated}} by an army {{under the direction of}} Santiago de Liniers, and Spanish authority was restored. It was expected that the British would return, and the whole city started to prepare for that possibility. Belgrano returned to Buenos Aires after the reconquest, and put himself under the command of Liniers. He was appointed sergeant of the Patricians Regiment, under the command of Cornelio Saavedra, and started to study military strategy. After some conflicts with other officials, he resigned as sergeant and served again under the command of Liniers. A new British attack took place in July 1807. During the battle he served as field assistant to a division commanded by Balbiani. After a successful resistance against the British, Belgrano resumed his work in the Consulate and discontinued his military studies. Because of his knowledge of French he had a brief interview with the defeated Robert Craufurd, who proposed British support for an independentist movement. Belgrano rejected the offer, considering that Britain would readily remove their support <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> more lucrative option in Europe, and in such case the revolutionaries would be helpless against a Spanish counterattack.|$|E

In July 1946 he {{spoke in a}} debate on the introduction of bread rationing, claiming that the Master Bakers' Association was only opposing out of concern for their own profits.|$|E

25|$|Born in London, Harper began elocution {{lessons at}} the Italia Conti Academy {{as a child}} in 1955, at the {{encouragement}} of his mother who was worried that he was developing a cockney accent. This led to him being cast as Master Bardell in an adaptation of Charles Dickens' novel The Pickwick Papers for the independent television company Associated-Rediffusion, when the company approached the Academy asking <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> boy with bright red hair for the role, and they recommended Harper.|$|E
25|$|Caesar {{describes}} the Suebi as pressing the German tribes of the Rhine, {{such as the}} Tencteri, Usipetes and Ubii, from the east, forcing them from their homes. While emphasizing their warlike nature he writes as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> settled homeland somewhere between the Cherusci and the Ubii, and separated from the Cherusci by a deep forest called the Silva Bacenis. He also {{describes the}} Marcomanni as a tribe distinct from the Suebi, and also active within the same alliance. But he does not describe where they were living.|$|E

25|$|Other {{indication}} of his passionate nature concerns an affair he {{is believed to}} have had with the English socialite Lady Ottoline Morrell, beginning when they first met in July or August 1898. Ottoline was then an unmarried 25-year-old member of the privileged London social scene, while being at the same time slightly contemptuous of it. Her intellectual and spiritual interests drew her to more mature men, such as Herbert Asquith, particularly <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> reputation for iconoclasm. She and Axel Munthe were drawn to each other, and managed to spend significant private time together on Capri.|$|E
25|$|The social {{composition}} of Soviet society changed drastically during the war. There was {{a burst of}} marriages in June and July 1941 between people about to be separated by the war {{and in the next}} few years the marriage rate dropped off steeply, with the birth rate following shortly thereafter to only about half of what it would have been in peacetime. For this reason mothers with several children during the war received substantial honours and money benefits <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> sufficient number of childrenâ€”mothers could earn around 1,300 roubles for having their fourth child and earn up to 5,000 roubles for their 10th.|$|E
25|$|The Finnish {{ice class}} rules {{published}} in 1932 introduced the ice classes 1A, 1B and 1C for ships strengthened for navigation in ice, ice class 2 for ships classified for unrestricted service but not strengthened for navigation in ice and ice class 3 for other vessels. Ice class 2 was further divided to two subclasses, 2A and 2B, and vessels {{were eligible for}} the former <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> radio. Detailed minimum requirements, again as an additional percentage of the open water requirement, were given for the stem, shell plating at the waterline, stiffeners, rudder and rudder bearings, and the propulsion machinery. In the lowest ice class, 1C, the requirements were limited to {{the bow of the}} vessel.|$|E

25|$|There is an {{abandoned}} donkey engine {{in the forest}} near {{the west bank of}} the Clearwater River at Marcus Falls. It can be seen from the viewpoint in late fall when leaves are off the trees, but otherwise it is not accessible. It was moved here in the winter of 1912-13 when the Canadian Northern Railway was being planned and some loggers figured they could get the contract for the Clearwater River bridge at Bailey's Chute <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> donkey on site. The 10-ton machine was skidded over the ice of Canim Lake, rafted along Mahood Lake in the spring, then winched to this location. The men had already cut 9000 cubic meters of timber when the railway was confirmed along a different route.|$|E
25|$|When the revolts began, Reynolds {{was asleep}} in her home in San Juan. At 2 A.M. she was awakened when more than forty armed policemen and National Guardsmen showed up at her doorstep. Even though {{they did not have}} a search warrant they {{proceeded}} to search the house, and confiscated her papers and speeches. When she asked them <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> search warrant they answered that they didn't but that they did have an order to arrest her. The police claimed that their actions were justified under the provisions of the Gag Law (Law 53) of Puerto Rico, known as the Ley de la Mordaza. Reynolds was taken into custody along with Carmen MarÃ­a PÃ©rez Roque and Olga Viscal Garriga. She was held for various days at police headquarters before she was transferred to La Princesa Prison.|$|E
25|$|Some {{the activists}} {{said that they}} were beaten during interrogations. Mattias Gardell also said there was sleep {{deprivation}} and that he was beaten several times. They also said that treatment depended on their skin colour, ethnicity and <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> Muslim-sounding name. One activist said they were not allowed to contact lawyers and were videotaped throughout. According to Henning Mankell, Israeli authorities confiscated their money, credit cards, mobile phones, laptops, cameras, and personal belongings including clothes. They were only allowed to keep papers. Several passengers had charges made to their confiscated debit cards and cell phones. Israel pledged to investigate the issue. An IDF officer and three soldiers were subsequently arrested by Israeli military police and charged with stealing laptops and mobile phones from passengers. Turkish journalist Adem Ã–zkÃ¶se, who was aboard the Marmara, said Israel's prison was like a 5-star hotel compared to Syria's jails.|$|E

25|$|There {{are eight}} {{boarding}} houses, nine {{including the one}} no longer in operation, on the campus. The houses are run by a small team of teachers. The House Master (HM) has overall responsibility and is helped by the Assistant House Master (AHM). Either or both of these will be present at the daily house meeting and will oversee homework to make sure pupils are studying. The HM will organise any special house events, decide who the house captain {{will be for the}} term as well as choosing a captain to take care of other house related goings on. The HM is also the person who most pupils would talk to <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> problem although all teachers are available for help. Both the HM and the AHM normally have residences within the houses and so are very much part of the house. Each house has a matron who helps the pupils through their daily routine as well as a tutor to help the pupils in their studies. The year a pupil is in, and the amount of rooms in the house decides which pupils are allowed a room of their own, although it is normally decided that younger years share whilst senior pupils get their own rooms. All pupils rotate rooms each term.|$|E
