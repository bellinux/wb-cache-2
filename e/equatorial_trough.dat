5|$|The {{origins of}} Typhoon Pamela {{were from a}} {{tropical}} disturbance that persisted in {{the eastern end of}} the <b>equatorial</b> <b>trough</b> on May13. At the time, it was located about 425km (265mi) north of Chuuk in the Federated States of Micronesia. The disturbance was initially difficult to locate as it tracked generally to the south and southwest, a motion caused by a southward-moving tropical upper tropospheric trough. On May14, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) indicated that the system developed into a tropical cyclone. That same day, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) followed suit and classified it as Tropical Depression 06W. The next day, data from the Typhoon Chasers indicated that the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Pamela. It was able to intensify after the trough receded northward, developing outflow. The storm turned to the south and east, gradually executing a counterclockwise loop through the FSM. This was due to a building ridge between Pamela and Typhoon Olga to its west. On May16, observations from Satawan in the Caroline Islands indicated that Pamela attained typhoon status, which is a tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds of at least 118km/h (74mph). This was confirmed the next day by the Typhoon Chasers.|$|E

40|$|NASA's Dawn {{spacecraft}} {{arrived at}} the asteroid 4 Vesta in July 2011 and is now collecting imaging and spectroscopic data during its one-year orbital mission. The maps we present are based on information obtained by the Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer VIR-MS and the multi-color Framing Camera FC. VIR covers the wavelength range between 0. 25 to 5. 1 µm while FC covers the range 0. 4 to 1. 0 µm. The VIR instrument has a significant higher spectral resolution than FC but the latter achieves higher spatial resolution data. As part of the geological and mineralogical analysis of the surface, a series of 15 quadrangles have been defined covering the entire surface of Vesta. We report about the mapping results of quadrangle Av- 6 (Gegania) and Av- 7 (Lucaria). The Gegania quadrangle is dominated by old craters showing no ejecta blankets and rays while several small fresh craters do. The most obvious geologic features are a set of <b>equatorial</b> <b>troughs,</b> {{a group of three}} ghost craters of similar diameter (~ 57 km), an ejecta mantling of the Gegania crater and three smaller craters showing bright and dark ejecta rays. The quadrangle contains two main geologic units: 1) the northern cratered trough terrain and 2) the <b>equatorial</b> ridge and <b>trough</b> terrain. The quadrangle shows moderate variation in Band II center wavelength and Band II depth. FC color ratio variations of some recent craters and their ejecta are linked to the bright and dark material. The bright material is possibly excavated eucritic material while the dark material could be remnants of a CM 2 impator(s) or an excavated subsurface layer of endogenic origin. The most prominent geologic features in the Lucaria quadrangle are the 40 km long hill Lucaria Tholus, a set of <b>equatorial</b> <b>troughs,</b> some relatively fresh craters with bright and dark material and mass wasting. The quadrangle contains three main geologic units: 1) the northern cratered trough terrain, 2) the <b>equatorial</b> ridge and <b>trough</b> terrain, and 3) the equatorial cratered terrain. The quadrangle exhibits moderate variation in Band II center wavelength and only small variation in Band II depth. FC ratio maps show a distinct variation of the pseudo 1 -µm band depth. Ejecta material showing steeper VIS spectral slope is located {{in the western part of}} the quadrangle...|$|R

50|$|A low {{pressure}} area developed within an <b>equatorial</b> <b>trough</b> centered over the southeastern Bay of Bengal on November 22. After tracking northwestward for about twenty-four hours, the system developed into Tropical Cyclone 05B, while located about 815 km (505 mi) east-southeast of Chennai, Tamil Nadu. While moving northward, it intensified into a deep depression at 1800 UTC on November 23. Strengthening continued and early on November 24, the deep depression was upgraded to a cyclonic storm. Later that day, the storm turned northwestward and later curved westward.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Ivan {{originated}} {{from an area}} of disturbed weather near the equator {{during the first week}} of October 1997. Two <b>equatorial</b> <b>troughs,</b> one in the Northern Hemisphere and one in the Southern Hemisphere developed from this system. Three resultant areas of low pressure formed; one in the Southern Hemisphere developed into Tropical Cyclone Lusi on October8, and two north of the equator steadily tracked westward. The eastern low developed into Typhoon Joan, while the western cyclone became the system that would intensify into Typhoon Ivan. Situated in an environment without significant convective activity, this system initially struggled to become organized. However, the disturbance began to mature, and by October11, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) discovered a low-level circulation center, prompting the issuance of a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert the following day.|$|R

40|$|We have modeled plasma {{transport}} in the low-latitude and equatorial ionosphere {{during the}} great magnetic storm of March 1989. Our goal {{was to provide a}} consistent explanation for the DMSP (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program) observations of dramatic decreases in ion density and rapid ion drifts in the low latitude ionosphere over South America during the storm. The modeling effort supports the hypothesis that abnormally large upward drifts lifted F region plasma above the satellite's altitude and created the density depletions observed by DMSP. Modeled O(+) densities at the satellite's altitude have a strong qualitative resemblance to DMSP observations. Both the model and the observations indicate a deep density trough with extremely sharp boundaries surrounding the equator. The widths of both the modeled and the observed <b>equatorial</b> <b>troughs</b> increase with time. Vertical ion drifts predicted by the model also have been compared with DMSP measurements. Like the observed vertical drifts, the modeled drifts reversed sign near the trough boundaries. The modeled vertical drifts are of the same order and direction as the vertical component of E x B convection near the equator, but of opposite direction (downward) near the trough boundaries and outside of the trough...|$|R
40|$|The {{morphology}} of the landslides in the Martian <b>equatorial</b> <b>troughs,</b> the {{geologic structure}} of the troughs, the time of emplacement, the similarity to terrestrial landslides, and the origin and mechanism of transport are analyzed. About 35 large landslides well-resolved on Viking images were examined, and {{it is found that}} the major landslides cover 31, 000 sq km of the trough floors, and individual slides range in area from 40 to 7000 sq km. The morphologic variations of the landslides can be attributed mainly to their degree of confinement on trough floors. Many prominent landslides appear to be of similar age and were emplaced after a major faulting that dropped the trough floors. Most sliding occurred after the created scarps were dissected into spurs, gullies, and tributary canyons. Emplacement of the landslides approximately coincided with a late episode of major eruptive activity of the Tharsis volcanoes, and it is suggested that the slides may have originated as gigantic mudflows with slump blocks at their heads. The large size of many landslides is due to the fault scarps as high as 7 km on which they formed in the absence of vigorous fluvial erosion. The landslides suggest that Mars is earthlike in some respects, which may be important for further evaluations...|$|R
50|$|A {{low-level}} <b>equatorial</b> <b>trough</b> {{developed an}} area of convection on May 4. The low strengthened as it became more organized {{over the next two}} days. Late on May 5, the JTWC issued a TCFA and the system was declared Tropical Depression 04W shortly after. The depression slowly intensified and was upgraded to a Tropical Storm early on May 8 and was named Kelly. Kelly was able to intensify slightly before strong vertical wind shear displaced the center, weakening Kelly. Kelly was downgraded to a Tropical Depression on May 10 and the remnant circulation dissipated the next day.|$|E

Robyn turned more to the northwest, where it reached a peak intensity of 135 mi/h km/h winds on the 7th. It weakened to a 100 mi/h km/h typhoon before hitting southwestern Japan on the 9th, and became extratropical on the 10th over the Sea of Japan. Robyn caused 45 fatalities, 39 of which were from traffic related accidents, and $68 million in damage (1993 USD).|$|E
50|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance formed along the near <b>equatorial</b> <b>trough</b> on April 20 {{well to the}} south of Guam.

The system reached its peak intensity on April 28. The subtropical ridge built to its northwest, steering Ken to the west. South-westerly vertical wind shear led to a weakening trend to begin on April 29. On April 30, Ken's low level circulation was exposed, no longer having any thunderstorms near the center. The remnant low drifted westward, dissipating by May 3.|$|E
40|$|NASA's Dawn {{spacecraft}} is collecting {{a variety}} of imaging, spectral, and elemental abundance data to characterize the geology, geochemistry, shape and internal structure of Vesta. Geologic mapping of Vesta's surface is being conducted at the global scale and {{as a series of}} 15 regional quadrangles. We report results from the mapping of quadrangle Av- 10 (Oppia). A mosaic of monochrome (clear filter) Framing Camera (FC) images from the High Altitude Mapping Orbit (HAMO) (70 m/pixel) serves as the base image with additional information about the surface gathered from Visible and Infra-Red (VIR) hyperspectral images, FC color ratio images, and a Digital Terrain Model (DTM: lateral spacing of 450 m/pixel and vertical accuracy of ~ 30 meters) derived from FC images. Quadrangle Av- 10 Oppia is located within the equatorial region of Vesta, and covers 22 °S to 22 °N latitude and 288 ° to 0 °/ 360 °E longitude. The four global units in Av- 10 are 1) cratered terrain in the north, 2) a broad, topographic low (Feralia Planitia) that dominates the central portion of the quadrangle and 3) a topographically higher area towards the south, and 4) <b>equatorial</b> <b>troughs</b> and ridges that cut across the quadrangle between 10 °S and 10 °N latitude. The northern cratered terrain is one of the older geologic units in Av- 10. A portion of this terrain was excavated by the impact that formed Feralia Planitia, one of the larger basin-like features on Vesta. Feralia Planitia is 270 km across and ~ 15 km deep in relation to the surrounding topographically higher terrain. This topographic low, which is bound by Vestalia Terra to the west (see quadrangle Av- 9 Numisia), has been reshaped by Oppia crater on the southern basin boundary, an unnamed crater (50 km) on the northern basin boundary, and by the ridge and trough terrain. A portion of a large northern trough (Saturnalia Fossa) is present in the northwest corner of the quadrangle (see quadrangles Av- 4 Domitia and Av- 9 Numisia) and E-W-trending <b>equatorial</b> <b>troughs</b> (Divalia Fossa) are located in the eastern half of the (see quadrangle Av- 6 Gegania). Oppia crater (D= 34 km, 8 °S, 309 °E) has a sharp rim and a smooth ejecta blanket with a low abundance of impact craters that indicates the crater is relatively young. In FC color-ratio images using approximations of Clementine ratios (Red: 750 / 430 nm; Green: 750 / 920 nm; Blue: 430 / 750 nm), the ejecta blanket has a distinct coloration in comparison to the surrounding terrain. Further study is underway to better understand the nature of this ejecta blanket. The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the Dawn Instrument, Operations, and Science Teams.

40|$|A global {{observational}} study of atmospheric conditions associated with tropical disturbance and storm development is presented. This study primarily uses upper air observations {{which have become}} available over the tropical oceans in the last decade. Climatological values of vertical stability, low level wind, tropospheric vertical wind shear and other parameters relative to the location and seasons of tropical disturbance and storm development are discussed. Individual storm data are also presented in summary form for over 300 development cases (with over 1, 500 individual observation times) for four tropical storm genesis areas. Results show that most tropical disturbances and storms form in regions equatorward of 20 " lat. on the poleward side of doldrum <b>Equatorial</b> <b>Troughs</b> where the tropospheric vertical shear of horizontal wind (Le., baroclinicity) is a minimum or zero. Storm development occurring on the poleward side of 20 " lat. in the Northwest Atlantic and Northwest Pacific takes place under significantly different environmental conditions, which are described. These latter developments make up but {{a small percentage of}} the global total. Observations are also presented which indicate that over the tropical oceans where disturbances and storms form, there is a distinct Ekman or frictional veering of the wind in the subcloud layer (surface to 600 m.) of approximately 10 ".

40|$|We {{produced}} a geologic {{map of the}} Av- 9 Numisia quadrangle of asteroid Vesta using Dawn spacecraft data {{to serve as a}} tool to understand the geologic relations of surface features in this region. These features include the plateau Vestalia Terra, a hill named Brumalia Tholus, and an unusual "dark ribbon" material crossing the majority of the map area. Stratigraphic relations suggest that Vestalia Terra {{is one of the oldest}} features on Vesta, despite a model crater age date similar to that of much of the surface of the asteroid. Cornelia, Numisia and Drusilla craters reveal bright and dark material in their walls, and both Cornelia and Numisia have smooth and pitted terrains on their floors suggestive of the release of volatiles during or shortly after the impacts that formed these craters. Cornelia, Fabia and Teia craters have extensive bright ejecta lobes. While diogenitic material has been identified in association with the bright Teia and Fabia ejecta, hydroxyl has been detected in the dark material within Cornelia, Numisia and Drusilla. Three large pit crater chains appear in the map area, with an orientation similar to the <b>equatorial</b> <b>troughs</b> that cut the majority of Vesta. Analysis of these features has led to several interpretations of the geological history of the region. Vestalia Terra appears to be mechanically stronger than the rest of Vesta. Brumalia Tholus may be the surface representation of a dike-fed laccolith. The dark ribbon feature is proposed to represent a long-runout ejecta flow from Drusilla crater...|$|R

While heading southwestward towards the Philippines, Manny rapidly intensified to a 135 mi/h km/h typhoon before hitting the Philippines late on the 9th. It weakened over the islands, and upper level winds kept it from restrengthening much over the South China Sea. Manny dissipated on the 16th over the Malay Peninsula, after causing 230 deaths, only one week after Lola hit the same area.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone to form in the northwest Pacific basin in January in six years. Forming along the near <b>equatorial</b> <b>trough,</b> two circulations formed {{on either side of}} Guam. Elsie formed from the eastern circulation, appearing southwest of Pohnpei on January 4. On January 5, further convective development occurred which formed a low level circulation on January 6. Becoming a tropical depression late that day and a tropical storm on January 7, the system moved northwest, reaching its peak intensity late in the day. Thereafter, strong southerly winds aloft arrested development, and weakening began. Tropical depression status was regained on January 8, and its circulation dissipated early January 9.|$|E

Taking a day to recover, the system attempted to reorganize and became a tropical storm early on December 3. Southerly vertical wind shear limited its development for much of its life cycle. Turning eastward, it reached its maximum intensity late on the 3rd before shearing apart on December 4. Early on December 5, the system degenerated into a weak area of low pressure.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{maps of the}} {{asteroid}} Vesta were derived from albedo and elevation (Hubble Space Telescope, 38 - 52 km/pixel), and color data and Earthbased spectroscopy were utilized to generate mineralogic and lithologic maps [1 - 6]. The Dawn spacecraft has acquired images of Vesta at resolutions up to 500 x higher, allowing us to advance from simple identification of the largest spatial and spectral features to complex geologic mapping of morphologic units and features, including stratigraphic and structural relationships. We here report on a 1 : 500, 000 -scale preliminary global map of Vesta, {{based on data from}} the High- Altitude Mapping Orbit (HAMO). This map is part of an iterative mapping effort; the geologic map is refined with each improvement in resolution [e. g., 7]. Geologic Setting: Vesta is an ellipsoidal asteroid with an equatorial radius of 283 km. It has been identified as the parent body for the Vestoids and the HED (howardite-eucrite-diogenite) family of meteorites. By dating HEDs, Vesta has been determined to be 4. 56 by old [8 - 10]. Previous data revealed that it has a surface composed of pyroxene-bearing minerals [e. g. 1 - 3]. Vesta has a heavily-cratered surface, with large basins evident in numerous locations. The south pole in particular is dominated by an impact basin so large it was identified before Dawn’s arrival; this basin has been named Rheasilvia. The surface is also characterized by a system of deep, globe-girdling <b>equatorial</b> <b>troughs</b> and ridges, as well as an older system to the north.

50|$|Like Typhoon Joe, Kim {{formed from}} the near <b>equatorial</b> monsoon <b>trough</b> on July 19. It tracked quickly westward-northwest {{underneath}} a subtropical ridge, reaching tropical storm strength on the July 21 and typhoon strength on July 23. After developing an eye, Kim began to rapidly intensify, {{and during the}} afternoon of July 24, peaked in intensity as a super typhoon. Several hours later, Kim made landfall over the Philippines, but the storm had weakened considerably by this time. Throughout the Philippines, 40 people were killed, two via drownings, and 19,000 others were directly affected. A total of 12,000 homes were destroyed and 5,000 villages received flooded. Less than a week earlier, the same areas were affected by Joe; however, Kim was considered the more damaging of the two typhoons. Land interaction took toll on Kim, and upon entering the South China Sea, was down below typhoon intensity. Kim continued northwestward, but with its disrupted circulation, it remained a tropical storm until hitting southern China July 27 to the northeast of Hong Kong, where damage was minor.

The latter system organized into Tropical Disturbance B1 on December 27, but wind shear in the region prevented significant development and dislocated the center from the thunderstorms. A ridge to the southeast steered the disturbance slowly southwestward toward Madagascar. As it neared the country, the system turned westward and intensified into a tropical depression after developing a spiral band of convection. On January 2, the depression made landfall near Antalaha in northeastern Madagascar, and quickly weakened over land.|$|E
50|$|A broad surface low {{formed in}} the near <b>equatorial</b> <b>trough</b> on August 7 about 1225 km south of Guam.

Late on August 11, the low became a tropical depression, which was named Edeng by PAGASA and designated 09W by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. It then moved west-northwest along the northern side of the monsoon trough as a sheared system due to moderate southerly flow aloft. A new circulation center developed, which led to PAGASA renaming the system Gloring as it neared the southern coast of Taiwan. The depression ultimately merged with a low pressure area over the South China Sea, which would develop into Tropical Storm Gerald.|$|E
50|$|Toward {{the end of}} March, an area of {{convection}} {{increased over}} the southern Bay of Bengal from an active <b>equatorial</b> <b>trough.</b> The system progressed northward, with a weak center between Sri Lanka and Sumatra by March 25.

However, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on March 29, a signal of further organization. That day, the IMD upgraded the system to a cyclonic storm, and early on March 30 the storm attained winds of 85 km/h (50 mph) while curving to the north-northeast. Increased wind shear from the westerlies imparted rapid weakening, causing the convection to dwindle to the northeast. According to the IMD, the storm rapidly dissipated on March 30.|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} a {{preliminary}} global geologic map of Vesta, {{based on data from}} the Dawn spacecraft's High- Altitude Mapping Orbit (HAMO) and informed by Low-Altitude Mapping Orbit (LAMO) data. This map is part of an iterative mapping effort; the geologic map has been refined with each improvement in resolution. Vesta has a heavily-cratered surface, with large craters evident in numerous locations. The south pole is dominated by an impact structure identified before Dawn's arrival. Two large impact structures have been resolved: the younger, larger Rheasilvia structure, and the older, more degraded Veneneia structure. The surface is also characterized by a system of deep, globe-girdling <b>equatorial</b> <b>troughs</b> and ridges, as well as an older system of troughs and ridges to the north. Troughs and ridges are also evident cutting across, and spiraling arcuately from, the Rheasilvia central mound. However, no volcanic features have been unequivocally identified. Vesta can be divided very broadly into three terrains: heavily-cratered terrain; ridge-and-trough terrain (equatorial and northern); and terrain associated with the Rheasilvia crater. Localized features include bright and dark material and ejecta (some defined specifically by color); lobate deposits; and mass-wasting materials. No obvious volcanic features are evident. Stratigraphy of Vesta's geologic units suggests a history in which formation of a primary crust was followed by the formation of impact craters, including Veneneia and the associated Saturnalia Fossae unit. Formation of Rheasilvia followed, along with associated structural deformation that shaped the Divalia Fossae ridge-and-trough unit at the equator. Subsequent impacts and mass wasting events subdued impact craters, rims and portions of ridge-and-trough sets, and formed slumps and landslides, especially within crater floors and along crater rims and scarps. Subsequent to the formation of Rheasilvia, discontinuous low-albedo deposits formed or were emplaced; these lie stratigraphically above the equatorial ridges that likely were formed by Rheasilvia. The last features to be formed were craters with bright rays and other surface mantling deposits. Executed progressively throughout data acquisition, the iterative mapping process provided the team with geologic proto-units in a timely manner. However, interpretation of the resulting map was hampered by the necessity to provide the team with a standard nomenclature and symbology early in the process. With regard to mapping and interpreting units, the mapping process was hindered by the lack of calibrated mineralogic information. Topography and shadow {{played an important role in}} discriminating features and terrains, especially in the early stages of data acquisition...|$|R

On December19, the southern component was classified as Tropical Depression 03F by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in Nadi, Fiji (Fiji Meteorological Service); at this time the depression was situated just east of the Solomon Islands. The northern component eventually developed into Typhoon Faxai, an extremely powerful Category 5 equivalent cyclone. Unlike Faxai, the precursor to Cyclone Waka developed slowly, mainly because of moderate wind shear in the region. Moving southeastward, the system gradually became more organized. On two occasions, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert; however, the agency later canceled them both times. By December27, the depression had entered a region of lesser shear, favoring significant development of the system. The following day, the JTWC classified the system as Tropical Depression 07P, when the storm was situated roughly [...] northwest of Pago Pago, American Samoa.|$|R
