50|$|Cylinders {{look like}} pumps, {{but they are}} the outputs of the energy, rather than the inputs. There are five {{versions}} of cylinders. The Generation 1 cylinders came in two lengths, only had one input and worked on pressure or vacuum. The Generation 2 cylinders have 2 inputs (and come in studded, studless, and small versions), and work on pressure in both directions. They allow pushing and pulling, depending on which <b>input</b> <b>air</b> is pumped into.|$|E
50|$|There is {{currently}} research {{being done in}} firing fossil-fueled power plants with an oxygen-enriched gas mix instead of air. Almost all of the nitrogen is removed from <b>input</b> <b>air,</b> yielding a stream that is approximately 95% oxygen. Firing with pure oxygen would result in too high a flame temperature, so the mixture is diluted by mixing with recycled flue gas, or staged combustion. The recycled flue gas {{can also be used}} to carry fuel into the boiler and ensure adequate convective heat transfer to all boiler areas. Oxy-fuel combustion produces approximately 75% less flue gas than air fueled combustion and produces exhaust consisting primarily of CO2 and H2O (see figure).|$|E

5000|$|Fuel gas for {{industrial}} use was made using producer gas technology. Producer gas {{is made by}} blowing air through an incandescent fuel bed (commonly coke or coal) in a gas producer. The reaction of fuel with insufficient air for total combustion produces carbon monoxide (CO); this reaction is exothermic and self-sustaining. It was discovered that adding steam to the <b>input</b> <b>air</b> of a gas producer would increase the calorific value of the fuel gas by enriching it with CO and hydrogen (H2) produced by water gas reactions. Producer gas has a very low calorific value of because the calorific gases CO/H2 are diluted with lots of inert nitrogen (from air) and carbon dioxide (CO2) (from combustion) ...|$|E
5000|$|During {{development}} it {{was decided}} to further improve the basic design by adding another feature then becoming common, a [...] "two spool" [...] compressor arrangement. Earlier engines generally consisted of a series of compressor stages connected via a shaft to one or more turbine stages, with the burners between them arranged around the shaft. Although this arrangement is mechanically simple, it has the disadvantage of lowering the efficiency of the compressor. Compressor stages run at their maximum efficiency when spinning at a specific speed for any given <b>input</b> <b>air</b> pressure - in a perfect compressor each stage would run at a separate speed. The multi-spool design, first used on the Bristol Olympus turbojet, is a compromise, the compressor being separated into [...] "spools" [...] designed to operate closer to most efficient speed, driven by separate turbines via concentric shafts. Two- and three-spool designs are common; beyond that the mechanical complexity is too great.|$|E
50|$|A {{rack and}} pinion with two racks and one pinion is used in actuators. An example is {{pneumatic}} {{rack and pinion}} actuators {{that can be used}} to control valves in pipeline transport. The actuators in the picture on the right are used to control the valves of large water pipeline. In the top actuator, a gray control signal line can be seen connecting to a solenoid valve (the small black box attached to the back of the top actuator), which is used as the pilot for the actuator. The solenoid valve controls the air pressure coming from the <b>input</b> <b>air</b> line (the small green tube). The output air from the solenoid valve is fed to the chamber in the middle of the actuator, increasing the pressure. The pressure in the actuator's chamber pushes the pistons away. While the pistons are moving apart from each other, the attached racks are also moved along the pistons in the opposite directions of the two racks. The two racks are meshed to a pinion at the direct opposite teeth of the pinion. When the two racks move, the pinion is turned, causing the attached main valve of the water pipe to turn.|$|E

To obtain good performance of a small hydraulic system, <b>input</b> <b>air</b> flow and output oil flow characteristics of the air-driven hydraulic pump should be properly understood. In this paper, based on a mathematical model which has been experimentally verified, the model of an air-driven hydraulic pump is proposed. Using the software MATLAB/Simulink for simulation, the dynamic characteristics of the pumps are obtained. To set a foundation for the optimization of the pump, the influence of key parameters on the output characteristics of the pump was studied.

Moreover, when the output oil pressure was fixed, an energy-saving method to enhance the output oil flow is to enlarge the area ratio of the pump.

Through the traditional economic models, {{it is found that}} on average Hong Kong experiences a higher accelerator effect but lower multiplier effect in airport investment compared to Singapore.

5000|$|CMAQ is {{an acronym}} for the Community Multi-scale Air Quality Model, a {{sophisticated}} atmospheric dispersion model developed by the US EPA to address regional air pollution problems. An example of a regional air pollution problem is a multi-state area where ozone or fine particulate levels exceed the US health standards. In addition to simulating the emission, advection, diffusion, and deposition of air pollutants, CMAQ treats {{a wide array of}} chemical reactions that occur throughout the lower atmosphere. For example, ozone forms in the atmosphere when nitrogen oxides interact with volatile organic compounds in the presence of sunlight. Ammonium sulfate is formed in fine particulate matter when sulfuric acid (formed largely in cloud water) interacts with gas-phase ammonia. [...] Meteorological conditions such as subsidence inversions, decrease the amount of fresh air available for dilution of air emissions, and increase the rate of production of secondary air pollutants. CMAQ has the capability to accurately predict air pollution concentrations resulting from secondary formation. Like any air dispersion model, CMAQ <b>inputs</b> <b>air</b> pollutant emissions and meteorological data and outputs air pollutant concentrations and deposited totals. Its particular strength is in assessing the efficacy of regional emissions control strategies in reducing regional air pollution levels.|$|R

The filter was tested for VOC reduction efficiencies in a PVC portable inflatable bubble provided with an air purifier system called Airbox II Phase by Zonair 3 d, as described hereinafter. The filter was placed in the Airbox II Phase of the bubble, between a pre-filter and a particulate HEPA H 14 filter. Simultaneous duplicate samples were taken from the <b>input</b> <b>air</b> duct before the driving system and from the bubble. VOC were dynamically sampled during 2 -h control periods by connecting custom packed glass multi-sorbent cartridge tubes (Carbotrap, Carbopack X and Carboxen 569) to air pump samplers. A validated analytical method based on TD-GC/MS was used to quantify a wide variety of VOC families (alkanes, aromatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, ketones, halocarbons, aldehydes, esters, terpenes, ethers, glycols and nitrogenated compounds). VOC family removal efficiencies ranged from 51 ± 19 % to 78 ± 22 % with input indoor air, and from 42 ± 16 % to 91 ± 18 % with input outdoor air. No significant differences in reduction efficiencies (t-test; p < 0. 05) were observed between using indoor or outdoor air.
