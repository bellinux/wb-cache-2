5|$|For {{his efforts}} in {{protecting}} British trade out of Oporto, the merchants there {{presented him with}} a letter of thanks, {{and a piece of}} plate valued at £50. As a reward for his <b>good</b> <b>service,</b> Downman was advanced to post-captain on 26December1798 and appointed commander of the 32-gun , a frigate that had recently been captured from the Spanish in the Action of 15July1798.|$|E
5|$|In 1776 Bewick {{became a}} partner in Beilby's workshop. The joint {{business}} prospered, becoming Newcastle's leading engraving service with an enviable reputation for high quality work and <b>good</b> <b>service.</b> In September 1776 he went to London for eight months, finding the city rude, deceitful and cruel, and much disliking the unfairness of extreme wealth and poverty side by side. He returned to his beloved Newcastle {{as soon as he}} could, but his time in the capital gave him a wider reputation, business experience, and an awareness of new movements in art.|$|E
5|$|By September 1997, Cracker Barrel had 314 restaurants, {{and aimed}} to {{increase}} the number of stores by approximately 50 per year over the following five years. The firm closed its Corner Market operations in 1997 and refocused on its restaurant and gift store locations. Its then president, Ron Magruder, stated that the chain was concentrating on strengthening its core theme, offering traditional foods and retail in a country store setting, with <b>good</b> <b>service</b> and country music. The chain opened its first restaurant and gift store not located near a highway in 1998, in Dothan, Alabama. In the 2000s, in the wake of incidents including charges of racial discrimination and controversy over its policy of firing gay employees, the firm launched a series of promotional activities including a nationwide book drive and a sweepstakes with trips to the Country Music Association Awards and rocking chairs among the prizes.|$|E
50|$|A light <b>goods</b> <b>service</b> continued, {{sustained}} {{in later years}} by the upgrading of RAF Edzell for a US Air Force base; however finally on 7 September 1964 the <b>goods</b> <b>service</b> ceased, and the Edzell branch closed completely.|$|R

50|$|Until {{the early}} 1990s, there were active <b>goods</b> <b>services</b> {{along the lines}} to Varese, and the station had a goods yard. Since then, {{following}} the termination of <b>goods</b> <b>services,</b> that yard has been transformed, with the agreement of FS, into a car parking station.|$|R
5|$|In the Rhineland, Custine {{continued}} the revolution by proclamation, and levied heavy {{taxes on the}} nobility and clergy. During the winter a Prussian army forced him to evacuate Frankfurt, re-cross the Rhine and fall back upon Landau. This occurred during Charles François Dumouriez's treasonous collaboration with the Austrians. Summoned to Paris to account for himself, Custine was accused of treason, but was ably defended by Robespierre, the French revolutionary and lawyer, who declared Custine an honest man who gave his country <b>good</b> <b>service.</b> With Robespierre's defense, he was cleared of all charges, and later given command of the Army of the North.|$|E
5|$|Scholar-officials {{who entered}} civil service through {{examinations}} acted as executive officials {{to a much}} larger body of non-ranked personnel called lesser functionaries. They outnumbered officials by four to one; Charles Hucker estimates that they were {{perhaps as many as}} 100,000 throughout the empire. These lesser functionaries performed clerical and technical tasks for government agencies. Yet they {{should not be confused with}} lowly lictors, runners, and bearers; lesser functionaries were given periodic merit evaluations like officials and after nine years of service might be accepted into a low civil service rank. The one great advantage of the lesser functionaries over officials was that officials were periodically rotated and assigned to different regional posts and had to rely on the <b>good</b> <b>service</b> and cooperation of the local lesser functionaries.|$|E
5|$|The Bilbie {{family of}} bell founders and clockmakers {{lived and worked}} in Chew Stoke for more than 200 years, from the late 17th century until the 19th century. They {{produced}} more than 1,350 church bells, which were hung in churches all over the West Country. Their oldest surviving bell, cast in 1698, is still giving <b>good</b> <b>service</b> in the local St Andrew's Church. The earliest Bilbie clocks date from 1724 and are highly prized. They are mostly longcase clocks, the cheapest with 30-hour movements in modest oak cases, but some have high quality eight-day movements with additional features, such as showing the high tide at Bristol docks. These latter clocks were fitted into quality cabinet maker cases and command high prices.|$|E

50|$|Passenger {{services}} ceased in 1952, but <b>goods</b> <b>services</b> {{continued until}} 1973, {{due in part}} to milk train services to the Co-op later Dried Milk Products creamery co-located at the station, which produced cheese. After the closure of <b>goods</b> <b>services,</b> the lines were removed and the station demolished.|$|R

5|$|Command of the Amazon {{then passed}} to Captain Samuel Sutton, who was succeeded the {{following}} year by Captain William Parker. Under Parker, Amazon captured the 16-gun privateer Felix on 26 July 1803, and survived a brush with a French fleet off Cape Capet on 2 May 1804. Amazon {{was one of the}} ships {{to take part in the}} Trafalgar Campaign {{the following year}}, serving with Nelson in the Mediterranean. On one occasion in December 1804 Nelson ordered Parker to bring a consignment of live bullocks to supply the fleet off Toulon. The Amazon was a notably smart ship, and had just been repainted, so presumably the instruction to convert his ship into a floating farmyard was not received with much enthusiasm. Parker duly returned with a shipment, prompting Nelson to enquire with gentle humour 'Well, Parker, of course you would not dirty the Amazon for much for anything; have you brought a dozen and a half, or a dozen?' Parker had in fact brought sixty bullocks and thirty sheep, prompting Nelson to promise a reward for his <b>good</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E
5|$|For {{nine weeks}} Riou and his small crew navigated the Guardian, by now {{little more than}} a raft, across the 400 leagues to the Cape of Good Hope. The Cape of Good Hope was sighted on 21 February 1790, and whalers were {{despatched}} from Table Bay to help the battered ship to safety. Riou ran her aground to prevent her sinking, but a gale struck the coast shortly afterwards, completing the wreck of the Guardian. The voyage was described by J. K. Laughton in the Dictionary of National Biography as 'almost without parallel'. Those who remained with the Guardian were among the few survivors of the accident. Of the boats sent out on 25 December, only the launch with 15 people survived, having been rescued by a French merchant. The launch had witnessed the sinking of the jolly-boat, before losing contact with the two cutters and the long-boat. Riou arranged for the surviving convicts who had helped to save the ship to be pardoned for their <b>good</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{the group}} {{arrives at the}} picturesque hotel, they find an {{energetic}} young manager Sonny (Dev Patel) but a dilapidated facility, not yet what he had promised. Overwhelmed by the cultural changes, Jean often stays inside at the hotel, while her husband Douglas explores the sights. Graham finds that the area has greatly changed since his youth and disappears on long outings every day. Muriel, despite her xenophobia, starts to appreciate her doctor for his skill and the hotel maid for her <b>good</b> <b>service.</b> Evelyn gets a job advising the staff of a call centre on how to interact with older British customers. Sonny struggles to raise funds to renovate the hotel and sees his girlfriend Sunaina (Tena Desae), despite his mother's disapproval.

40|$|This paper {{identifies}} {{and defines}} ecosystem <b>goods</b> and <b>services</b> provided by marine biodiversity. Case {{studies have been}} used to provide an insight into the practical issues associated with the assessment of marine ecosystem <b>goods</b> and <b>services</b> at specific locations. The aim of this research was to validate the definitions of <b>goods</b> and <b>services,</b> and to identify knowledge gaps and likely difficulties of quantifying the <b>goods</b> and <b>services.</b> A validated theoretical framework for the assessment of <b>goods</b> and <b>services</b> is detailed, and examples of the <b>goods</b> and <b>services</b> at a variety of case study areas are documented. These results will enable future assessments of marine ecosystem <b>goods</b> and <b>services.</b> It is concluded that the utilisation of this <b>goods</b> and <b>services</b> approach has the capacity to play a fundamental role in the Ecosystem Approach, by enabling the pressures and demands of society, the economy and the environment to be integrated into environmental management...|$|R
