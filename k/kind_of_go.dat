500|$|... "Empty Orchestra"—the name {{of which}} is a literal {{translation}} of the Japanese word karaoke—was written by Pemberton and Shearsmith, and was directed by Guillem Morales. It was originally intended as a wholly musical episode. The resulting episode, for Pemberton, was [...] "a kind of musical", in that [...] "there's music all the way through it". While he would be interested in doing [...] "a proper La La Land-style musical" [...] in the future, [...] "Empty Orchestra" [...] serves to [...] " [...] that box to some degree". The idea of a love story, which is how Pemberton characterised [...] "Empty Orchestra", was also [...] "very appealing". Pemberton ultimately chose the episode as his favourite of the series, calling it very different to other episodes of Inside No. 9. At the series launch, speaking in reference to the previous episode [...] "The Riddle of the Sphinx", Pemberton said that [...] "When you’ve cut someone's bum off and eaten it, you <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>go,</b> well, better try something different!" [...] One influence on the episode was Shane Meadows's This Is England; Pemberton drew inspiration from the way that characters' enjoyment of music events was portrayed in the film.|$|E
500|$|During a 2001 {{interview}} with Gary Graff from Wall of Sound Magazine, Maida recounted {{the inspiration for}} the lyrics of [...] "Are You Sad". He was in New York recording [...] "In Repair" [...] at the old Hit Factory studio, which was later known as Avatar Studios. Following those sessions, Maida attempted to call his younger brother from his hotel room but couldn't get through. [...] "When you're making a record, you <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>go</b> into hiding, especially when I'm writing lyrics or writing music; I tend not {{to keep in touch with}} any friends or family or stuff. But my brother and I have a good relationship, and I want to keep it good. I couldn't get a hold of him for, like, a week, and I knew he was going through a shitty time — typical young-20s, no job, having a tough life. I wanted to talk to him desperately, and this song just came out of me, [...] "Are You Sad?" [...] It came out really quickly on a shitty travel guitar". The meaning of [...] "If You Believe" [...] was revealed in a 2001 {{interview with}} Cleveland.com, [...] "That song's about having an out-of-body experience and seeing that the afterlife is real," [...] Maida confirms, [...] "and telling people that there's something machines can't have, and we've got it.|$|E
2500|$|Whilst on tour, {{the band}} became reacquainted with Claritys {{producer}} Mark Trombino, {{and decided to}} work with him once again for their forthcoming album. Trombino also produced the band's second studio album, Static Prevails (1996), and their commercial breakthrough, Bleed American (2001). Jimmy Eat World subsequently began recording tracks at their home studio and rehearsal space, Unit 2 in Tempe, Arizona. After [...] "taking [...] songs as far as [...] could," [...] the band emailed them to Trombino, who was based in Los Angeles. Jim Adkins remarked, [...] " [...] would do a mix of it and add production ideas and we would just <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>go</b> back and forth like that. [...] is the wizard at computers, and the history that we have working with him we don't have with anybody else, so it made sense on the familiarity level and the ease of working level." [...] Although the band and Trombino spent little time together in the studio, Trombino joined Jimmy Eat World [...] "a couple of times", with Adkins travelling to Los Angeles to join Trombino during the mixing process. Regarding the overall recording process, Adkins stated: [...] "I could definitely see our approach being a standard working method in the future for a lot of people. It frees up a lot of our geographic restrictions for both the producer and the band; it's not just someone next door." ...|$|E

She began writing songs before entering Australian Idol, but stated that she had [...] "stopped and just did the projects I was told to do," [...] referring to her first two albums released through Sony BMG. Paulini had no songwriting credits on her debut album One Determined Heart (2004), and co-wrote only two tracks on her second album Superwoman (2006). In an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald, Paulini revealed that she felt manufactured with her first two albums, saying: [...] "You kind of actually feel trapped because when they would ask you to make an album, they'd {{have a list of}} songs ready for you to choose from. It was like a massive list of just songs that other people have written that you can just <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>go,</b> 'Oh yeah. I like that one. I like the sound of this.' It just didn't seem real. I mean, it wasn't real for me. They were all great songs and written by awesome writers. But, they weren't my words and my experiences; I didn't feel like it belonged to me." [...] Paulini was heavily involved with the songwriting on her third album Come Alive (2015), having co-written all but two tracks on the album. She referred to Come Alive as her first real album as she took her time working on it, explaining that with [...] "this one, this is me. Every experience in there is me, it's what I've gone through, or what I’ve interpreted {{from my point of view}} with other situations with my friends and family." ...|$|E

5000|$|Regarding Noctourniquets aesthetic, Rodriguez-Lopez noted, [...] "For myself, it was {{definitely}} keeping things concise. At first, I had a rule that I was only gonna play four notes per song, but that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>went</b> away after a while. But it {{was definitely}} about limiting the guitar, and just taking all those parts and arranging them for other instruments—mainly the keyboard." ...|$|R

5000|$|As {{early as}} 1924, Lofting was editorializing about the {{negative}} effects of war on children. In an article written for The Nation, Lofting railed against what he called “tin-soldierism,” a state of mind common at the time that glorified war and “heroic deaths”. He attacked the so-called children’s classics about heroes galloping across battlefields. “That <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> battlefield has <b>gone</b> for good,” he wrote, “it is still bloody, but you don’t gallop. And since that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> battlefield has <b>gone,</b> that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> book—for children—should <b>go</b> too.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Regarding {{the writing}} process for her lyrics, Holter noted, [...] "I {{basically}} just write stream of consciousness to a certain extent, I let the song <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>go</b> where it wants to go. I don't think that's a new idea, at all, but I think that maybe I do it to an extreme." [...] Both [...] "Sea Calls Me Home" [...] and [...] "Betsy on the Roof" [...] were written years prior to recording and often performed during Holter's live performances. [...] "Lucette Stranded on the Island" [...] was influenced by Colette's novella, Chance Acquaintances, while novelist Christopher Isherwood's recurring fictional character, Sally Bowles, was an influence in writing [...] "How Long?".|$|E

The controversial ending of The Amazing Spider-Man #700 was leaked on December 14, 2012, twelve {{days before the}} issue's December 26 release date and four days before retailers were to receive the issue. Slott responded to the leak by asking readers {{to wait for the}} full comic and experience the ending in context.

5000|$|Williams is an ideas-driven author: {{the idea}} comes first. “Usually {{for me the}} trigger is an idea more than a {{character}} or a title.

(Well, I help.)” In an interview with Heiner Wittmann for Klett-Cotta, Williams explains, “Almost every book starts out as {{maybe one or two}} or three small ideas and then they <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>go</b> into the mix and I wait.
