5|$|Biological {{structures}} or sequences {{in different}} taxa are homologous {{if they are}} derived from a common ancestor. Homology thus implies divergent evolution. For example, many insects (such as dragonflies) possess two pairs of flying wings. In beetles, the first pair of wings has <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> a pair of hard wing covers, while in Dipteran flies the second pair of wings has <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> small halteres used for balance.|$|E

50|$|This game {{features}} two Sinnoh related Pokémon {{species from}} the Diamond and Pearl generation introduced in Pokémon: Destiny Deoxys, {{both of which}} <b>evolve</b> <b>into</b> previous species. They are Munchlax, which <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> Snorlax, and Bonsly, which <b>evolves</b> <b>into</b> Sudowoodo. However, they cannot be obtained in the Advanced series titles, because they lack the Sinnoh Pokédex, although the player can temporarily use Bonsly during one minigame.|$|R
5|$|Another {{model of}} the {{evolution}} of this genus, also proposed by Casier in 1960, is that the direct ancestor of the Carcharocles is the shark Otodus obliquus, which lived from 60 mya to 13 mya during the Paleocene and Miocene epochs. In this model, O. obliquus <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> O. aksuaticus, which <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> C. auriculatus, and then into C. angustidens, and then into C. chubutensis, and then finally into C. megalodon. The evolution of this lineage is characterized by the increase of serrations, the widening of the crown, the development of a more triangular shape, and the disappearance of the lateral cusps. The genus Otodus is ultimately derived from Cretolamna, a shark from the Cretaceous period.|$|E

50|$|This is {{the most}} common method of {{evolution}} across all Pokémon Generations, and involves Pokémon acquiring experience points through battling other Pokémon (both wild and captured).

5|$|Pratchett's {{earliest}} Discworld novels {{were written}} largely to parody classic sword-and-sorcery fiction (and occasionally science-fiction); as the series progressed, Pratchett dispensed with parody almost entirely, and the Discworld series <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> straightforward (though still comedic) satire.|$|E

5|$|Although writing first {{appeared}} during the very late 4th millennium BC, it was only used to convey short names and labels; connected strings of text did not appear until about 2600 BC, {{at the beginning of}} the Old Kingdom. This development marked the beginning of the first known phase of the Egyptian language: Old Egyptian. Old Egyptian remained a spoken language until about 2100 BC, when, during the beginning of the Middle Kingdom, it <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> Middle Egyptian. While Middle Egyptian was closely related to Old Egyptian, Late Egyptian was significantly different in grammatical structure. Late Egyptian possibly appeared as a vernacular language as early as 1600 BC, but was not used as a written language until c. 1300 BC during the Amarna Period of the New Kingdom. Late Egyptian <b>evolved</b> <b>into</b> Demotic by the 7th century BC, and although Demotic remained a spoken language until the 5th century AD, it was gradually replaced by Coptic beginning in the 1st century AD.|$|E
5|$|Another project, {{which aims}} to {{overhaul}} the game and improve upon the gameplay and graphics to better resemble the original PlayStation version, was released in 2013 {{by members of the}} Romhacking.net community.
