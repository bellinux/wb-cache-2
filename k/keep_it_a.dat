25|$|Dextromethorphan was {{excluded}} from the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) of 1970 and was specifically {{excluded from the}} Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. As of 2010, Dextromethorphan was still excluded from U.S. scheduling of controlled substances; however, officials have warned that it could still be added if increased abuse warrants its scheduling. The motivation behind its exclusion from the CSA was that, under the CSA, all optical isomers of listed Schedule II opiates are automatically Schedule II substances. Since dextromethorphan is an optical isomer of the Schedule II opiate levomethorphan (but does not act like an opiate), an exemption was necessary to <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> non-controlled substance. The Federal Analog Act {{does not apply to}} dextromethorphan because a new drug application has been filed for it.|$|E
