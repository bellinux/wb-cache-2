5|$|For many {{communities}} {{the existence of}} buildings that formerly housed residential schools are a traumatic reminder of the system's legacy, and there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> discussion about demolition, heritage status and how the possibility of incorporating sites into the healing process.|$|E
5|$|There <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> {{speculation}} {{over the}} functions of Triceratops head adornments. The two main theories have revolved around use in combat, or display in courtship, with the latter thought now {{to be the most}} likely primary function.|$|E

5|$|It is {{also found}} in brackish-water {{habitats}} and is sometimes seen swimming in salt water. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> more successful at colonizing Atlantic and Gulf coast barrier islands than the copperhead. However, even on these islands, it tends to favor freshwater marshes. A study by Dunson and Freda (1985) describes it as not being particularly salt-tolerant.|$|E
5|$|Reconstruction of the {{historical}} development of Vithoba worship <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> debated. In particular, several alternative theories have been proposed regarding the earliest stages, as well as the point at which he came to be recognised as a distinct deity. The Pandurangashtakam stotra, a hymn attributed to Adi Shankaracharya of the 8th century, indicates that Vithoba worship might have already existed at an early date.|$|E
5|$|Regarding air transport, Aarhus {{is served}} by the Aarhus Airport in Tirstrup about 35km {{northeast}} of the city centre. There <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> discussion about constructing a new airport closer to the city for many years, but so far, no plans have been realised. In August 2014, the city council officially initiated a process to assert the viability of a new international airport. A small seaplane now operates four flights daily between Aarhus harbour and Copenhagen harbour.|$|E

5|$|The Peruvian pelican {{is listed}} as Near Threatened because, {{although}} the population is estimated by BirdLife International to exceed 500,000 mature individuals, and is possibly increasing, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> higher in the past. It declined dramatically during the 1998 El Niño event and could experience similar declines in the future. Conservation needs include regular monitoring throughout the range to determine population trends, particularly after El Niño years; restricting human access to important breeding colonies; and assessing interactions with fisheries.|$|E
5|$|The filters were {{designed}} by Campbell {{for the purpose of}} separating multiplexed telephone channels on transmission lines, but their subsequent use <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> more widespread than that. The design techniques used by Campbell have largely been superseded. However, the ladder topology used by Campbell with the constant k is still in use today with implementations of modern filter designs such as the Tchebyscheff filter. Campbell gave constant k designs for low-pass, high-pass and band-pass filters. Band-stop and multiple band filters are also possible.|$|E
5|$|Though Thomas wrote {{exclusively}} in the English language, he has been acknowledged {{as one of the}} most important Welsh poets of the 20th century. He is noted for his original, rhythmic and ingenious use of words and imagery. His position as one of the great modern poets <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> discussed, and he remains popular with the public.|$|E

5|$|A Quistclose {{trust is}} a trust created where a {{creditor}} has lent {{money to a}} debtor for a particular purpose. In {{the event that the}} debtor uses the money for any other purpose, it is held on trust for the creditor. Any inappropriately spent money can then be traced, and returned to the creditors. The name and trust comes from the House of Lords decision in Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd (1970), although the underlying principles can be traced back further. There <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> academic debate over the classification of Quistclose trusts in existing trusts law: whether they are resulting trusts, express trusts, constructive trusts or, as Lord Millett said in Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley, illusory trusts.|$|E
5|$|Alfred Eisenack's {{original}} {{description of}} the Chitinozoans placed them in three families, spanning seven genera, based on morphological grounds. Further genera were identified, at first on an annual basis, as time progressed. Since its publication in 1931, Eisenack's original classification <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> honed by these additional discoveries, as well as advances in microscopy. The advent of the scanning electron microscope in the 1970s allowed the improved detection of surface ornamentation which is hugely important in identification - as can be appreciated by {{a comparison of the}} images on this page. Even the light microscope image here is of far greater quality than could have been achieved earlier in the century, using poorly preserved specimens and less advanced microscopes.|$|E
5|$|Although {{classified}} as poisonous, reports of human deaths resulting from its ingestion are extremely rare. After parboiling—which weakens its toxicity and {{breaks down the}} mushroom's psychoactive substances—it is eaten in parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. Amanita muscaria is noted for its hallucinogenic properties, with its main psychoactive constituent being the compound muscimol. The mushroom {{was used as an}} intoxicant and entheogen by the peoples of Siberia, and has a religious significance in these cultures. There <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> speculation on possible traditional use of this mushroom as an intoxicant in other places such as the Middle East, Eurasia, North America, and Scandinavia.|$|E

5|$|Another very ancient seat is the {{so-called}} “Chair of Dagobert” in the Louvre. It is of cast bronze, sharpened with the chisel and partially gilt; it is of the curule or faldstool type and supported upon legs terminating in the heads and feet of animals. The seat, which was probably of leather, has disappeared. Its attribution depends entirely upon the statement of Suger, abbot of St Denis in the 12th century, who added a back and arms. Its age <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> discussed, but Viollet-le-Duc dated it to early Merovingian times, and it may in any case be taken as the oldest faldstool in existence.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the vague}} {{language}} of the document, there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> scholarly debate over {{how it should be}} interpreted. John Maddicott saw the wording as a hostile warning to the new king to avoid the mistakes of his father, or face the consequences. J. R. S. Phillips, on the other hand, took the signatories to be positively inclined towards Edward II. There were others who were more intrinsic in their opposition to the king and Gaveston, primarily the Earl of Warwick. The purpose of the document, in Phillips view, was to present the king with a warning, and hopefully protect him against the more antagonistic members of the nobility.|$|E
5|$|By 3 May 1975, North Vietnamese forces {{controlled}} all of South Vietnam, just 55 {{days after}} opening their attack on Buôn Ma Thuột. During that time period, {{an army of}} approximately three-quarters of a million men was defeated by a force one-fourth its size. Since {{the end of the}} war, there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> historical recrimination and discussion as to how and why such a lopsided victory had occurred. Four main lines of thought have remained particularly viable, all of which possess some validity, but all are also open to argument.|$|E

5|$|Crawley's oldest {{church is}} St John the Baptist's, between the High Street and the Broadway. It {{is said to}} have 13th-century origins, but there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> {{rebuilding}} (especially in the 19th century) and the oldest part remaining is the south wall of the nave, which is believed to be 14thcentury. The church has a 15th-century tower (rebuilt in 1804) which originally contained four bells cast in 1724. Two were replaced by Thomas Lester of London in 1742; but in 1880 a new set of eight bells were cast and installed by the Croydon-based firm Gillett, Bland & Company.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{were divided}} in their reviews of The Turn of the Screw. The acting and {{tone of the}} {{production}} were generally praised, but the plot's divergences from the original story were less well received. A particular disagreement concerned the film's horrific elements; some critics considered it to be genuinely scary, while others suggested that the horror was not fully effective. The original story <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> analysed owing to its ambiguity, and critics disagreed {{about the extent to}} which the film succeeded in portraying this trait. Academic analyses found the film considerably less ambiguous than the novella. The Turn of the Screw was released on DVD on 1 March 2010 in the UK and on 28 April 2015 in North America.|$|E
5|$|Following Llywelyn's {{death in}} 1240, Gwynedd's power {{declined}} {{and many of}} its eastern lands were taken by Henry III of England in 1247. Llywelyn's grandson, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, took power in 1255 and imprisoned his brother Owain ap Gruffudd before extending his power across Wales. Owain was eventually released in 1277 and there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> historical debate over which castle he was held in. Hywel Foel ap Griffri wrote a famous poem describing Owain's long imprisonment in a round tower; historians believe that this refers to the keep at Dolbardarn.|$|E
