We develop a chronology for the Weddell Sea sector of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet that, combined with ages from other Antarctic ice-sheet sectors, indicates that the advance to and retreat from their maximum extent was within dating uncertainties synchronous with most sectors of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets. Surface climate forcing of Antarctic mass balance would probably cause an opposite response, whereby a warming climate would increase accumulation but not surface melting.

On her death-bed, tortured, at last, with a sense of the dreadful guilt which she had taken upon her soul, the wicked countess sent for Elizabeth, revealed the story of the ring, and besought forgiveness for her treachery. But the queen, still obdurate, even while remorse for past obduracy was tugging at her heart-strings, shook the dying woman in her bed, as if struggling with death for the privilege of wreaking her revenge and spite. The spirit of the countess passed away, to undergo the justice, or receive the mercy, of a higher tribunal; and tradition says, that the fatal ring was found upon her breast, where it had imprinted a dark red circle, resembling the effect of the intensest <b>heat.</b> The <b>attendants,</b> who prepared the body for burial, shuddered, whispering one to another, that the ring must have derived its heat from the glow of infernal fire.

A closed-form solution for the motion, heating, and the variation of drag loading parameter m/C(D) A has been obtained for the case of constant maximum resultant deceleration during nonlifting entries. This solution requires certain simplifying assumptions which do not compromise the accuracy of the results.

40|$|The {{maintenance}} of variance and <b>attendant</b> <b>heat</b> flux in linear, forced dissipative baroclinic shear flows subject to stochastic excitation is examined. The baroclinic problem, is intrinsically nonnormal and its stochastic dynamics {{is found to}} differ significantly from the more familiar stochastic dynamics of normal systems. When the shear is sufficiently great in comparison to dissipative effects, stochastic excitation supports highly enhanced variance levels in these nonnormal systems compared to variance levels supproted by the same forcing and dissipation in related normal systems. The eddy variance and associated heat flux are found to arise in response to transient amplification of a subset of forcing functions that obtain energy from the mean flow and project this energy on a distinct subset of response functions (EOFs) that are in turn distinct from the set of normal modes of the system. A method for obtaining the dominant forcing and response functions {{as well as the}} distribution of heat flux for a given flow is described...|$|R

40|$|Ridge {{subduction}} is an inescapable plate tectonic process, but {{has only}} been documented in modern circum-Pacific environments and not yet been recognized from suture zones associated with supercontinent assembly, likely because its imprint is obliterated by later collision. The formation of the Pan-African Damara Belt of central Namibia involved northward subduction of the Khomas Sea underneath the Congo Craton, prior to final suturing of the Congo and Kalahari Cratons. The accretionary history of the Belt is preserved in the Southern and Southern Marginal Zones, which consist of turbiditic metasedimentary and intercalcated mafic rocks with MORB affinity. Two localities in the Kuiseb and Gaub canyons reveal that aluminous metapelites contain a fabric-defining assemblage of fine-grained muscovite, chlorite, biotite, quartz and graphite that is overprinted by randomly oriented porphyroblasts and poikiloblasts of garnet, staurolite, kyanite and biotite. Associated metamafic rocks consist of hornblende, chlorite, epidote, rutile and quartz, with actinolite cores preserved in amphibole porphyroblasts. Metamorphic conditions for the fabric-defining assemblage are estimated at ∼ 10 kbar and 540 – 560 inline imageC, whereas peak metamorphism likely occurred at 10 – 10. 5 kbar and 600 inline imageC. Consequently, these rocks preserve a two-stage prograde metamorphic history, where initial tectonic burial was followed by relatively rapid, near-isobaric <b>heating</b> without <b>attendant</b> deformation to peak metamorphic conditions. We propose that initial burial occurred through subduction and underplating to the accretionary prism, before ridge subduction and opening of a slab window heated the rocks to peak metamorphic conditions. The exceptional preservation of the tectono-thermal imprint of the accretionary orogenic stage {{is due to the}} relatively soft, largely aborted collision that characterized the Damara orogeny, which {{can be attributed to the}} confined extent of the Khomas Sea...|$|R

Under the same operating conditions, the amount of condensate retention on a specimen is significantly reduced after a hydrophilic surface treatment (up to 43. 5 % lower). Due to more filmwise manner of retention and a reduced possibility of bridging, a super-hydrophilic surface shows improved drainage performance for these tested heat exchangers, over the entire range of fin spacing (more than 30 % mass reduction for all cases of Fs = 1. 1 mm, Fs = 2. 0 mm, and Fs = 5. 2 mm).

40|$|Mineral deposit types {{commonly}} have {{a distinctive}} temporal distribution with peaks at specific periods of Earth history. Deposits of less redox-sensitive metals, such as gold, show long-term temporal patterns {{that relate to}} first-order changes in an evolving Earth, {{as a result of}} progressively declining <b>heat</b> production and <b>attendant</b> changes in global tectonic processes. Despite abundant evidence for plate tectonics in the early Pre-cambrian, it is evident that plume events were more abundant in a hotter Earth. Episodic growth of juvenile continental crust appears to have been related to short-lived (< 100 m. y.) cata-strophic mantle-plume events and formation of supercontinents, whereas shielding mantle-plume events cor-related with their breakup. Different mineral deposit types are associated with this cycle of supercontinent for-mation and breakup. Broadly synchronous with juvenile continental crust formation was the development of subcontinental lithospheric mantle, which evolved due to progressively declining heat flow and decreasing plume activity. Archean subcontinental lithospheric mantle has a distinct mineralogical composition and is buoyant, whereas later lithosphere was progressively more dense. Changes in the buoyancy of both oceanic lithosphere and subcontinental lithospheric mantle led to evolution of tectonic scenarios in which buoyant, roughly equidimensional, early Precambrian cratons were rimmed by Proterozoic or Phanerozoic linear elon...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{results are}} {{presented}} {{for a series of}} experiments that addressed the effect of small pinhole defects on the potential lifetime of a Venus superpressure balloon. The experiments were performed on samples of a candidate balloon envelope material through which a single small hole of 80 to 300 microns in diameter was deliberately made in each one by puncturing with a metal pin. The material was mounted horizontally in a test apparatus and then a 2 - 3 mm thick layer of sulfuric acid was placed on top to mimic balloon wetting at Venus. Acid penetration and damage manifested itself as a darkening of the aluminum metal and adhesive layers around the hole in the balloon material. There were no test conditions under which the acid simply fell through the pinhole due to gravity because the surface tension forces always compensated at this size. Very little acid-damaged material was observed for the smallest 80 micron pinholes while gas flowed through the hole due to balloon-like pressurization: the black spot size was approximately 0. 2 mm in diameter after 6 days with 86 % sulfuric acid. The damage area grew more quickly in the absence of gas flowing out of an 80 micron hole, namely at a rate of 2 mm/day. It was concluded that the flow of escaping gas out of the hole provides a substantial reduction of the rate of acid penetration and damage. Larger diameter pinholes of approximately 300 micron diameter showed larger growth rates of 0. 7 mm/day with gas flow and 1. 7 mm/day without. The pinhole size did not change over the duration of these experiments because the material has an outer layer of fluoropolymer film that remained intact during the process and thereby held the hole size constant. None of the damage rates measured in these experiments pose a threat to the lifetime of the balloon over the projected course of a 30 day mission because the affected area is too small to cause a structural failure either through direct damage or increased solar <b>heating</b> and <b>attendant</b> balloon pressurization leading to burst...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEvidence from {{geologic}} archives {{suggests that}} there were large changes in the tropical hydrologic cycle associated with the two prominent northern hemisphere deglacial cooling events, Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS 1; ∼ 19 to 15 kyr BP; kyr BP= 1000 yr before present) and the Younger Dryas (∼ 12. 9 to 11. 7 kyr BP). These hydrologic shifts have been alternatively attributed to high and low latitude origin. Here, we present a new record of hydrologic variability based on planktic foraminifera-derived δ 18 O of seawater (δ 18 Osw) estimates from a sediment core from the tropical Eastern Indian Ocean, and using 12 additional δ 18 Osw records, construct a single record of the dominant mode of tropical Eastern Equatorial Pacific and Indo-Pacific Warm Pool (IPWP) hydrologic variability. We show that deglacial hydrologic shifts parallel variations in the reconstructed interhemispheric temperature gradient, suggesting a strong response to variations in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and the <b>attendant</b> <b>heat</b> redistribution. A transient model simulation of the last deglaciation suggests that hydrologic changes, including a southward shift in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) which likely occurred during these northern hemisphere cold events, coupled with oceanic advection and mixing, resulted in increased salinity in the Indonesian region of the IPWP and the eastern tropical Pacific, which is recorded by the δ 18 Osw proxy. Based on our observations and modeling results we suggest the interhemispheric temperature gradient directly controls the tropical hydrologic cycle on these time scales, which in turn mediates poleward atmospheric heat transport...|$|R

For a very wide fin spacing, a hydrophobic treatment may also help decrease the retention due to reduced droplet size, but it is not as effective as the hydrophilic treatment. It is also observed that hydrophilic treatment causes a slight heat-transfer degradation (a trend within the experimental uncertainty), due to the filmwise mode of condensation, and the degradation is relatively lager for specimens with wide fin spacing because the benefits of dropwise condensation are more pronounced under conditions of little or no bridging (~ 15 % Colburn j factor degradation for specimens with Fs = 5. 2 mm). Nevertheless, pressure drop across the heat exchanger is more sensitive to the enhancement of surface wettability (~ 40 % reduction for Fs = 1. 1 mm and ~ 20 % reduction for wider fin spacing). The results suggest that the advantages of hydrophilic treatment should be fully exploited for compact heat exchangers, {{due to the fact that}} the pressure drop and pumping power consumption can be managed while heat-transfer performance does not deteriorate. As part of the effort to understand the underlying mechanisms for condensate retention, a model for predicting the mass of retained condensate is proposed based on laminar filmwise condensation assumptions. The model suggests that mass retention on a heat exchanger increases with latent heat transfer rate (Ql) and decreases with air-side Reynolds number (Redh), which are also reflected by the experimental data. The model is successful in predicting the magnitude and trends of condensate retention for the heat exchanger specimens over a wide range of tested conditions. A surface embossing technique that can inexpensively impart micro-grooved topographical features on aluminum fin stock to enhance water drainage is introduced, as another direction to explore for manipulating fin wettability. The parallel-groove surface features serve to increase the apparent contact angle of water droplets placed onto the surface. A consistent reduction of critical sliding angle is observed on these embossed surfaces (grooves were aligned to the direction of gravity), which is due to the contact line discontinuities and contact line pinning effects induced by groove structure on the surface. Water droplets exhibit an elongated shape along with the direction of micro-grooves, and this anisotropic wetting is attributed solely to the roughness anisotropy...|$|R
