5000|$|Beginning in 2012, Rodgers {{held his}} Big <b>Fan</b> <b>Bracket</b> tournament, {{in which he}} pitted all the things of which he {{considered}} himself a [...] "big fan:" [...] mostly, but not exclusively, models and actresses. The first winner was Dominique Sachse.|$|E
60|$|The {{scene was}} a drawing-room, with old-fashioned heavy sash windows opening {{on a narrow}} brick-walled town-garden sloping down to a river, and neatly kept. The same might {{be said of the}} room, where heavy old-fashioned furniture, {{handsome}} but not new, was concealed by various flimsy modernisms, knicknacks, <b>fans,</b> <b>brackets,</b> china photographs and water-colours, a canary singing loud in the window in the winter sunshine.|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, SoBe Lifewater {{partnered with}} AOL FanHouse to bring college {{basketball}} <b>fans</b> a <b>bracket</b> challenge {{where they could}} play their bracket against the brackets of celebrities, including Kendra Wilkinson, Brooklyn Decker, Jerry Rice and Kenny [...] "The Jet" [...] Smith. Those <b>fans</b> whose <b>bracket</b> beat a celebrity bracket {{had a chance to}} meet them. If a fan had a perfect bracket, they could win up to $10,000,000.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2006, {{his second}} album Player was {{released}} topping the French chart. For producing the new album, he collaborated with Belgian producers Bionix, Rachid Mir and Christian Dessart mixing R & B with pop and crunk'n b, and artists Red Rat and Zoxea and geared toward the younger and feminine <b>fan</b> <b>brackets.</b> He also enjoyed great popularity with gay audiences. The first single from his second album {{was the very}} successful [...] "De retour" [...] featuring Tyron Carter. That was followed with single [...] "Oh la la la (Sexy Miss)" [...] with Red Rat.|$|R
5000|$|Pappas {{previously}} {{hosted the}} AOL Original Series, 2 Point Lead ( [...] a sports comedy show). He was the Co-Anchor, alongside journalists, Marianna Antonio and Pedro Andrade, of Fusion Live, a live, primetime, one-hour news magazine program {{which focused on}} current events, pop culture and satire. Fusion network launched in September 2013 as a joint venture of ABC and Univision. Yannis’ Half Hour Comedy Central Special aired in June 2014. He was also the co-host, along with comedian Chris Distefano, of MSG’s sports <b>fan</b> show, The <b>Bracket.</b> He has also been featured doing stand up on AXS TV twice, TRUTV’s How To Be a Grown Up, VH1’s “Best Week Ever”, Fox Business' Kennedy and Good Morning America on ABC. He was the first comedian to ever do stand-up comedy on the new Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. It was a test show and did not air. Alongside his standup comedy, Pappas had previously partnered up with lifelong friend and director Jesse Scaturro to create the production company Ditch Films. The comedy production team produced live and filmed comedy. He {{is known for his}} popular internet characters Maurica and Mr. Panos.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} regular refraction (where regular implies all waves meet at a single point) of a shock at an oblique planar contact discontinuity separating conducting fluids of different densities {{in the presence of}} a magnetic field aligned with the incident shock velocity. Planar ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations indicate that the presence of a magnetic field inhibits the deposition of vorticity on the shocked contact. We show that the shock refraction process produces a system of five to seven plane waves that may include fast, intermediate, and slow MHD shocks, slow compound waves, 180 ^∘ rotational discontinuities, and slow-mode expansion fans that intersect at a point. In all solutions, the shocked contact is vorticity free and hence stable. These solutions are not unique, but differ in the types of waves that participate. The set of equations governing the structure of these multiple-wave solutions is obtained in which fluid property variation is allowed only in the azimuthal direction about the wave-intersection point. Corresponding solutions are referred to as either quintuple-points, sextuple-points, or septuple-points, depending on the number of participating waves. A numerical method of solution is described and examples are compared to the results of numerical simulations for moderate magnetic field strengths. The limit of vanishing magnetic field at fixed permeability and pressure is studied for two solution types. The relevant solutions correspond to the hydrodynamic triple-point with the shocked contact replaced by a singular structure consisting of a wedge, whose angle scales with the applied field magnitude, bounded by either two slow compound waves or two 180 ^∘ rotational discontinuities, each followed by a slow-mode expansion <b>fan.</b> These <b>bracket</b> the MHD contact which itself cannot support a tangential velocity jump {{in the presence of a}} non-parallel magnetic field. The magnetic field within the singular wedge is finite and the shock-induced change in tangential velocity across the wedge is supported by the expansion fans that form part of the compound waves or follow the rotational discontinuities. To verify these findings, an approximate leading-order asymptotic solution appropriate for both flow structures was computed. The full and asymptotic solutions are compared quantitatively. © Cambridge University Press 201...|$|R
