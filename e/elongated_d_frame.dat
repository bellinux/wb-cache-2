In this study, the additional {{degrees of freedom}} available in five-phase permanent magnet motors {{have been used for}} three purposes: 1) enhancing the torque producing capability of the motor, 2) improving the reliability of the system, and 3) better adjusting of the torque and flux linkages of the five-phase direct torque controlled system. 1) Due to the fact that space and time harmonics of the same orders will contribute positively to output torque, a five-phase permanent magnet motor with quasi-rectangular back-EMF waveform is supplied with combined fundamental and third harmonic of currents. For modeling and analysis of the motor a 0 3 3 1 1 q <b>d</b> q <b>d</b> <b>frame</b> of reference is defined where 1 1 q d rotates at the synchronous speed and 3 3 q d rotates at the three times synchronous speed. Based on the mathematical model in the 0 3 3 1 1 q <b>d</b> q <b>d</b> <b>frame</b> of reference, it is shown that this system while having a higher torque density with respect to a conventional permanent magnet synchronous machine, is also compatible with vector control algorithm. 2) A resilient current control of the five-phase permanent motor with both sinusoidal and trapezoidal back-EMF waveforms under asymmetrical fault condition is proposed. In this scheme, the stator MMF is kept unchanged during healthy and faulty condition. Therefore, the five-phase permanent magnet motor operates continuously and steadily without additional hardware and just by modifying the control algorithm in case of loss of up to two phases. The feature is of major importance in some specific applications where high reliability is required. 3) High torque and flux ripple are the major drawbacks of a three-phase direct torque controlled system. The number of space voltage vectors directly influences the performance of DTC system. A five-phase drive, while benefiting from other advantages of high order phase drives, has inherently 32 space voltage vectors which permits better flexibility in selecting the switching states and finer adjustment of flux and torque. A sensorless direct torque control of five-phase permanent magnet motor is implemented. Speed information is obtained based on the position of stator flux linkages and load angle. Experiments have been conducted on a 5 kW five-phase surface mount permanent magnet motor and a 3 kW five-phase interior permanent magnet motor by using TMS 320 C 32 DSP. The results obtained are consistent with theoretical studies and simulation analysis, which further demonstrate the feasibility and practical significance of the five-phase permanent magnet motor drives...|$|R

Using Reference Frame Transformation, the current is transformed from a − b − c stationery frame to rotating 0 − <b>d</b> − q <b>frame.</b> Using the PI controller, the current in the 0 − <b>d</b> − q <b>frame</b> is controlled to get the desired reference signal. A controller with integral action combined with an actuator that becomes saturated can give some undesirable effects. If the control error is so large that the integrator saturates the actuator, the feedback path becomes ineffective because the actuator will remain saturated even if the process output changes. The integrator being an unstable system may then integrate to a very large value, the phenomenon known as integrator windup. Implementing the integrator anti-windup circuit turns off the integrator action when the actuator saturates, hence improving {{the performance of the}} SAPF and dynamically compensating harmonics in the power network.

40|$|An {{automated}} {{vision system}} performs critical tasks in video surveillance, while decreasing costs and increasing efficiency. It can provide high quality scene monitoring without {{the limitations of}} human distraction and fatigue. Advances in embedded processors, wireless networks, and imager technology have enabled computer vision systems to be deployed pervasively in stationary surveillance monitors, hand-held devices, and vehicular sensors. However, the size, weight, power, and cost requirements of these platforms present a great challenge in developing real-time systems. This dissertation explores the development of background modeling algorithms for surveillance on embedded platforms. Our contributions are as follows: - An efficient pixel-based adaptive background model, called multimodal mean, which produces results comparable to the widely used mixture of Gaussians multimodal approach, at a much reduced computational cost and greater control of occluded object persistence. - A novel and efficient chromatic clustering-based background model for embedded vision platforms that leverages the color uniformity of large, permanent background objects to yield significant speedups in execution time. - A multi-scale temporal model for midground analysis which provides a means to "tune-in" {{to changes in the}} scene beyond the standard background/foreground framework, based on user-defined temporal constraints. Multimodal mean reduces instruction complexity with the use of fixed integer arithmetic and periodic long-term adaptation that occurs once every <b>d</b> <b>frames.</b> When combined with fixed thresholding, it performs 6. 2 times faster than the mixture of Gaussians method while using 18 % less storage. Furthermore, fixed thresholding compares favorably to standard deviation thresholding with a percentage difference in error less than five percent when used on scenes with stable lighting conditions and modest multimodal activity. The chromatic clustering-based approach to optimized background modeling takes advantage of the color distributions in large permanent background objects, such as a road, building, or sidewalk, to speedup execution time. It abstracts their colors to a small color palette and suppresses their adaptation during processing. When run on a representative embedded platform it reduces storage usage by 58 % and increases runtime execution by 45 %. Multiscale temporal modeling for midground analysis presents a unified approach for scene analysis that can be applied to several application domains. It extends scene analysis from the standard background/foreground framework to one that includes a temporal midground object saliency window that is defined by the user. When applied to stationary object detection, the midground model provides accurate results at low sampling frame rates (~ 1 fps) while using only 18 Mbytes of storage and 15 Mops/sec processing throughput.

40|$|This study {{concerns}} the formulation and validation of a 3 <b>d</b> <b>frame</b> element {{that accounts for}} the inelastic response under the interaction of axial, flexural, shear and torsional effects. The proposed finite element addresses {{the need for a}} general beam element capable of accurately simulating the global as well as the local response of slender structural elements. The new element accounts for the warping of arbitrary cross sections due to shear and torsion by introducing warping degrees of freedom at each section in order to accommodate higher order strain kinematics. The warping profile at a section uses the necessary number of Lagrange interpolation functions for the desired accuracy of local response. The warping distribution along the element axis is described by either Lagrange polynomials or spline interpolation functions. The number of interpolation parameters can be adjusted to control the accuracy of the local and global response. The 3 d beam element formulation is derived from a mixed Hu-Washizu variational potential, with the inclusion of the warping displacements as independent variables. In the proposed formulation the section response is coupled through the interpolation of the stress resultants and the warping displacements along the element axis. Because the stress resultants satisfy the element equilibrium exactly with the use of suitable force interpolation functions, the element is free of shear-locking. Non-uniform warping is accommodated by the warping displacement distributions, so that the proposed element can represent the stresses arising from local warping constraints. The element is incorporated in a general purpose finite element analysis program with the consistent linearization of the governing equations for warping force equilibrium and for element compatibility resulting in a robust algorithm for the element state determination. The element is validated with several examples of linear and nonlinear material response of steel members. The linear elastic response is validated with analytical results, finite element models and some available experimental measurements. The inelastic response under monotonic and cyclic load conditions involves shear link specimens with wide flange and box section under high shear. The accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed element is demonstrated by comparing the numerical results with available experimental measurements from eccentrically braced steel frames and with local response results from solid and shell finite element models. The study concludes with the investigation of the axial, flexural and torsion interaction under large displacements. The corotational formulation is derived from a general hypothesis that establishes the accuracy and scope of application of this method. Several numerical examples are used for the illustration of key nonlinear geometry aspects of slender elements under the interaction of axial, flexural and torsional effects...|$|R
