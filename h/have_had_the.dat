5|$|A leucistic Coragyps atratus brasiliensis was {{observed}} in Piñas, Ecuador in 2005.

5|$|Amanita australis {{mushrooms}} {{that have}} lost their warts and <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> colours faded may resemble another New Zealand species, A.nothofagi.

5|$|According to the Hittite inscriptions, {{it appears}} that the Ahhiya were a {{powerful}} empire, at the same scale as contemporary Egypt, Assyria and the Hittite Empire. Moreover, {{based on the fact that}} Attarsiya launched a military campaign in Anatolia and fielded one hundred chariots, in addition to infantry, Dutch researcher Jorrit Kelder suggested that Ahhiya must <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> military capacity of at least three times the size of the Mycenaean kingdom of Pylos, based on the information recorded on the Linear B tablets unearthed from the specific palace. Based on this view, the Achaeans under Attarsiya may have formed some kind of alliance which included several Mycenaean kingdoms.|$|E

5|$|As {{originally}} {{proposed in}} 1925, the line's junction with the IND Crosstown Line in Long Island City {{would have been}} a T-junction, allowing trains from Manhattan to travel south to Brooklyn via the Crosstown line. A map from June of that year shows a proposed alternate routing for the Queens Boulevard Line, that would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> line turn via Kew Gardens Road after the Union Turnpike station instead of continuing via Queens Boulevard. After proceeding via Kew Gardens Road the line would have turned via Hillside Avenue. The map also shows a two-track line continuing from the Van Wyck Boulevard station to 94th Avenue (Atlantic Avenue) in Richmond Hill via Van Wyck Boulevard (today's Van Wyck Expressway). During construction only bellmouths were built for the line, however they were eventually used for the IND Archer Avenue Line. As documented by the map, the Queens Boulevard Line, as originally planned, would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> express trains travel on a more direct route, via Broadway and Queens Boulevard, while the local trains would take a less direct route hitting larger population centers. There were to be two such instances, however only one was actually completed. The first one, which was not constructed, would have gone through Winfield (now Woodside), west of the existing Elmhurst Avenue station, and the local tracks would have diverged, continuing via Queens Broadway before turning onto 69th Street (Fisk Avenue), rejoining the express tracks at Broadway in Woodside. The second instance, the one that was built, was planned to have the local tracks continue via Broadway west of the 65th Street station, and then it would turn south via Steinway Street before rejoining the express tracks at the 36th Street station. The express tracks here would take the more direct route, via Northern Boulevard.|$|E
5|$|Daurises, {{who seems}} to <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> largest army, {{initially}} took his army to the Hellespont. There, he systematically besieged and took the cities of Dardanus, Abydos, Percote, Lampsacus and Paesus, each {{in a single day}} according to Herodotus. However, when he heard that the Carians were revolting, he moved his army southwards to attempt to crush this new rebellion. This places the timing of the Carian revolt to early 497 BC.|$|E
5|$|Despite the uncertainly {{surrounding}} {{the inception of}} his reign, the chronicle reveals that Lǫgmaðr faced continued opposition from within his own family {{in the form of}} an ongoing rebellion by his brother, Haraldr.

Afterwards, if the chronicle is to be believed, Lǫgmaðr repented the cruelty that he had inflicted upon Haraldr, and remorsefully resigned his kingdom, before setting off to Jerusalem, where he died.|$|E

5|$|During the Permian, the dragonflies Odonata {{were the}} {{dominant}} aerial predator and probably dominated terrestrial insect predation as well. True Odonata {{appeared in the}} Permian and all are amphibian. Their prototypes are the oldest winged fossils, {{go back to the}} Devonian, and are different from other wings in every way. Their prototypes may <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> beginnings of many modern attributes even by late Carboniferous and it is possible that they even captured small vertebrates, for some species had a wing span of 71cm. The earliest beetle-like species during the Permian had pointed, leather like forewings with cells and pits. Hemiptera, or true bugs had appeared in the form of Arctiniscytina and Paraknightia having forewings with unusual venation, possibly diverging from Blattoptera.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1940, Steinbeck and Ricketts hired a Monterey Bay sardine fishing boat, the Western Flyer, with a four-man crew, {{and spent}} six weeks {{travelling}} {{the coast of}} the Gulf of California collecting biological specimens.
