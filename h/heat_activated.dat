Spc 1 /StyI {{is activated}} by Wis 1, a MAPK kinase (MEK), which is itself activated by Wik 1 /Wak 1 /Wis 4, a MEK kinase (MEKK). Spc 1 /StyI is inactivated by the tyrosine phosphatases Pyp 1 and Pyp 2. Inhibition of Pyp 1 was recently reported {{to play a}} crucial role in the oxidative stress and heat shock responses. These conclusions were based on three findings: 1) osmotic, oxidative, and <b>heat</b> stresses <b>activate</b> Spc 1 /StyI in wis 4 cells; 2) oxidative stress and <b>heat</b> shock <b>activate</b> Spc 1 /StyI in cells that express Wis 1 AA, in which MEKK consensus phosphorylation sites were replaced with alanine; and 3) Spc 1 /StyI is maximally activated in �pyp 1 cells.

There is a clear link between temperature sensation and pain—painful temperature sensations occur acutely and are a hallmark of inflammatory and chronic pain disorders of the nervous system.
