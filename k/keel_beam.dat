50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is built}} from wood. The fuselage is a monocoque design, while {{the wings and}} tail surfaces are a wooden frame covered in doped aircraft fabric covering. The fuselage is of a hexagonal section forward and a diamond section aft. The fuselage is built upon a main <b>keel</b> <b>beam</b> that also contains the control runs.

50|$|In the mid 1980s, the Omsk OKB started {{developing}} the TV-O-100, a light 650 hp engine {{designed specifically for}} the Mi-44. The engine would increase the aircraft's take-off weight to 1800 kg and allow a maximum speed of up to 260 km/h. Studies conducted by Mil in 1986 and 1987 concluded that replacing the Mi-34's original M-14V26 piston engine with the TV-O-100 gas turbine engine would require changing the airframe. The resultant new airframe mockup incorporated many changes, including the relocating the fuel tank to under the gearbox and relocating the stabilizer to the <b>keel</b> <b>beam</b> in the tail.|$|E
40|$|A {{lightweight}} energy-absorbing keel-beam {{concept was}} developed and retrofitted in a general aviation type aircraft to improve crashworthiness performance. The energy-absorbing beam consisted of a foam-filled cellular structure with glass fiber and hybrid glass/kevlar cell walls. Design, analysis, fabrication and testing of the <b>keel</b> <b>beams</b> prior to installation and subsequent fullscale crash testing of the aircraft are described. Factors such as material and fabrication constraints, damage tolerance, crush stress/strain response, seat-rail loading, and post crush integrity, which influenced {{the course of the}} design process are also presented. A theory similar to the one often used for ductile metal box structures was employed with appropriate modifications to estimate the sustained crush loads for the beams. This, analytical tool, coupled with dynamic finite element simulation using MSC. Dytran were the prime design and analysis tools. The validity of the theory as a reliable design tool was examined against test data from static crush tests of beam sections while the overall performance of the energy-absorbing subfloor was assessed through dynamic testing of 24 " long subfloor assemblies...|$|R

50|$|In 1952, {{the airline}} {{reported}} its first annual profit: $36,410.12. The airline's market share rose to 30% that year, up from 10% in 1950, {{the year the}} airline adopted the name TPA-The Aloha Airline. However, {{the introduction of the}} Convair 340 at Hawaiian Airlines halted further growth of TPA's market share for over five years. In 1958, real estate developer Hung Wo Ching, whose family held a sizable stake in the airline and following overtures by Tongg, was elected president of the airline. In November of that year, the company changed its name again, becoming Aloha Airlines. On April 15, 1959, Aloha took delivery of its first Fairchild F-27 turboprop aircraft. These aircraft were unique to Aloha, built with a stronger <b>keel</b> <b>beam</b> and thicker belly skin to satisfy concerns about ditching the high-wing aircraft. That summer, Aloha's market share jumped to 42%.|$|E
5000|$|The B-24's spacious, slab-sided {{fuselage}} (which {{earned the}} aircraft the nickname [...] "Flying Boxcar") was built around two central bomb bays that could accommodate up to 8,000 lb of ordnance in each compartment (but rarely did, as this decreased range and altitude). The forward and aft bomb bay compartments were further split longitudinally with a centerline ventral catwalk just nine inches (23 cm) wide, which also functioned as the fuselage's structural <b>keel</b> <b>beam.</b> An unusual four-panel set of all-metal, tambour-panel [...] "roller-type" [...] bomb bay doors, which operated {{very much like}} the movable enclosure of a rolltop desk, retracted into the fuselage, creating a minimum of aerodynamic drag to keep speed high over the target area, and also allowed the bomb bays to be opened while on the ground; the low ground clearance prevented the use of normal bomb bay doors. The occasional need for crewmen to move around inside from fore to aft within the B-24's fuselage during a mission over the narrow catwalk was a drawback shared with other designs.|$|E
5000|$|The 727 was {{designed}} for smaller airports, so independence from ground facilities was an important requirement. This led {{to one of the}} 727's most distinctive features: the built-in airstair that opens from the rear underbelly of the fuselage, which initially could be opened in flight. Hijacker D. B. Cooper parachuted from the back of a 727 as it was flying over the Pacific Northwest. Boeing subsequently modified the design with the Cooper vane so that the airstair could not be lowered in flight. [...] Another innovation was the auxiliary power unit (APU), which allowed electrical and air-conditioning systems to run independently of a ground-based power supply, and without having to start one of the main engines. An unusual design feature is that the APU is mounted in a hole in the <b>keel</b> <b>beam</b> web, in the main landing gear bay. The 727 is equipped with a retractable tail skid that is designed to protect the aircraft {{in the event of an}} over-rotation on takeoff. The 727's fuselage has an outer diameter of 148 in. This allows six-abreast seating (three per side) and a single aisle when 18 in wide coach-class seats are installed. An unusual feature of the fuselage is the 10 in difference between the lower lobe forward and aft of the wing as the higher fuselage height of the center section was simply retained towards the rear.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{crashworthiness}} of the energy-absorbing <b>keel</b> <b>beam</b> {{that could}} be used for sub-floor of an aircraft was numerically studied using finite element software (ABAQUS/EXPLICIT). Effects of various parameters, i. e. web thickness, radius of everting stringer, and friction coefficient, were investigated and the conditions under which the <b>keel</b> <b>beam</b> could produce progressively crushing deformation were explored. The results show that web thickness, t, and radius of everting stringer, r, have great influence on the performance of the <b>keel</b> <b>beam.</b> When the ratio of r/t is in the range of 4 - 6, a low peak force (peak force reduction of 50 %), stable and relative high stress plateau, and progressively crushing deformation mode can be produced from the energy-absorbing <b>keel</b> <b>beam.</b> By selecting appropriates parameters, energy absorption behavior has been significantly improved comparing with the traditional <b>keel</b> <b>beam.</b> Finally, a new energy-absorbing <b>keel</b> <b>beam</b> with variable web thickness was proposed. It has been demonstrated that the <b>keel</b> <b>beam</b> with variable web thickness is an ideal crashworthiness structure. It could not only significantly reduce the peak force, but also remain the stable and effective force plateau: meanwhile avoid web buckling. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Neural networks {{are not only}} asked to return some meaningful indices of the structural behavior but also to reproduce load–time curves during crash phenomena. To contain the number of examples required for the training process, parallel subsystems of small neural networks are designed. Design points for the training process are obtained by explicit finite element analyses performed by PAMCRASH. The settlement of the points in the design domain is defined using a maximum distance concept. The procedure is applied to different typical absorption structures made of aluminum alloy: riveted tubes, honeycomb structures, longitudinal <b>keel</b> <b>beam</b> and intersection elements of helicopter subfloors...|$|E
40|$|A {{full-scale}} {{crash test}} was successfully conducted in March 2010 of an MD- 500 helicopter at NASA Langley Research Center s Landing and Impact Research Facility. The reasons for conducting this test were threefold: 1 To generate {{data to be}} used with finite element computer modeling efforts, 2 To study the crashworthiness features typically associated with a small representative helicopter, and 3 To compare aircraft response to data collected from a previously conducted MD- 500 crash test, which included an externally deployable energy absorbing (DEA) concept. Instrumentation on the airframe included accelerometers on various structural components of the airframe; and strain gages on <b>keel</b> <b>beams,</b> skid gear and portions of the skin. Three Anthropomorphic Test Devices and a specialized Human Surrogate Torso Model were also onboard to collect occupant loads for evaluation with common injury risk criteria. This paper presents background and results from this crash test conducted without the DEA concept. These results showed accelerations of approximately 30 to 50 g on the airframe at various locations, little energy attenuation through the airframe, and moderate to high probability of occupant injury for a variety of injury criteria...|$|R

40|$|The {{crashworthy}} {{behavior of}} composite materials and generic structural elements is investigated. Cruciform structural elements are crushed {{in order to}} determine their energy absorption capability to rotorcraft crash-type loads, and quasi-static compression tests are conducted on a series of aluminum and composite cruciform elements. These elements are representative of <b>keel</b> <b>beam</b> and bulkhead intersections in the subfloor of rotorcraft. Various designs of 'trigger mechanisms' reducing initial peak failure loads and initiating stable crushing failure modes are considered. It is shown that a carbon-fiber-composite/aramid-fiber-composite hybrid element with a columnlike midsection behaves more like a well-designed tubular composite element.

40|$|A {{study of}} {{applications}} of filamentary composite materials to aircraft fuselage structure was performed. General design criteria were established and material studies conducted using the 727 - 200 forebody {{as the primary}} structural component. Three design approaches {{to the use of}} composites were investigated: uniaxial reinforcement of metal structure, uniaxial and biaxial reinforcement of metal structure, and an all-composite design. Materials application studies for all three concepts were conducted on fuselage shell panels, <b>keel</b> <b>beam,</b> floor beams, floor panels, body frames, fail-safe straps, and window frames. Cost benefit studies were conducted and developmental program costs estimated. On the basis of weight savings, cost effectiveness, developmental program costs, and potential for early application on commercial aircraft, the unaxial design is recommended for a 5 -year flight service evaluation program...|$|E
40|$|Free-piston linear {{generators}} (FPLGs) have attractive application {{prospects for}} hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) owing to their high-efficiency, low-emissions and multi-fuel flexibility. In {{order to achieve}} long-term stable operation, the hybrid system design and full-cycle operation strategy are essential factors that should be considered. A 25 kW FPLG consisting of an internal combustion engine (ICE), a linear electric machine (LEM) and a gas spring (GS) is designed. To improve the power density and generating efficiency, the LEM is assembled with two modular flat-type double-sided PM LEM units, which sandwich a common moving-magnet plate supported by a middle <b>keel</b> <b>beam</b> and bilateral slide guide rails to enhance the stiffness of the moving plate. For the convenience of operation processes analysis, the coupling hybrid system is modeled mathematically and a full cycle simulation model is established. Top-level systemic control strategies including the starting, stable operating, fault recovering and stopping strategies are analyzed and discussed. The analysis results validate that the system can run stably and robustly with the proposed full cycle operation strategy.
