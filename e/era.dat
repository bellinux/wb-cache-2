40|$|<b>ERas,</b> {{a unique}} {{member of the}} Ras family, was {{initially}} found only in embryonic stem (ES) cells, where it {{plays a crucial role}} in the transformation of transplanted ES cells to teratomas. <b>ERas</b> is involved in ES cell survival, and unlike other Ras family members, is constitutively active without any mutations. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and role of <b>ERas</b> in human gastric cancer. To test whether <b>ERas</b> played a significant role in human cancer cells, we examined its expression and function in gastric cancer. <b>ERas</b> was expressed in gastric cancer cell lines at different levels. Induction of <b>ERas</b> expression activated the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI 3 K) /Akt axis and then enhanced anchorage-independent growth and <b>ERas</b> knockdown by siRNA suppressed cell invasion. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that <b>ERas</b> was expressed in 38. 7 % (55 / 142) of human gastric carcinoma tissues, and its expression was significantly associated with metastasis to the liver (P < 0. 0001) and lymph nodes (P < 0. 05). <b>ERas</b> up-regulated transcription regulatory factors including ZFHX 1 A, ZFHX 1 B, and TCF 3, which repress E-cadherin. These data suggest that <b>ERas</b> is activated in a significant population of gastric cancer, where it may play a crucial role in gastric cancer cell survival and metastases to liver via down-regulation of E-cadherin...|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a {{molecular beam epitaxy}} growth technique to create intentionally textured interfaces between semimetallic <b>ErAs</b> and GaAs that result in interface orientations that {{are different from the}} substrate. To grow the textured interfaces, <b>ErAs</b> is deposited on (100) GaAs and islands form in an island growth mode. Enough GaAs is then deposited to fill the space between islands with semiconductor. More <b>ErAs</b> is deposited on the ErAs/GaAs surface and the new <b>ErAs</b> islands are thought to nucleate on the exposed top surface of the partially covered islands. The process is repeated to "stack" the islands. By quadratically increasing the amount of <b>ErAs</b> deposited in each repetition, the islands form into cones/pyramids that coalesce into a complete film with an intentionally roughened interface. Compared to a smooth interface between <b>ErAs</b> and GaAs, the Schottky barrier height between textured <b>ErAs</b> and n-GaAs can be reduced from similar to 0. 81 to similar to 0. 52 eV, and the Schottky barrier height between <b>ErAs</b> and p-GaAs can be increased from similar to 0. 38 to similar to 0. 63 eV.

40|$|Agency {{creation}} at the European Union (EU) level {{differs from}} that at the national one. European regulatory agencies (<b>ERAs)</b> have limited formal powers and separation from other actors, resembling networks rather than stand-alone agencies. <b>ERAs</b> for economic regulation have been created later and in smaller numbers than for social regulation. Using a historical rational analysis, this paper argues that past delegations to other non-majoritarian institutions at the EU and national levels condition the creation of European agencies. The Commission has defended its existing role and powers, accepting <b>ERAs</b> when they aid its strategy to increase its own reach and ensuring that it has many controls over them. When member states have created independent regulatory agencies (IRAs), those IRAs have defended their autonomy and resisted strong <b>ERAs.</b> Formalized EU networks of IRAs have hindered the establishment of powerful <b>ERAs</b> and when created, <b>ERAs</b> have involved layering and conversion of those networks. Hence formal delegation to <b>ERAs</b> has been limited and uneven...|$|R

40|$|The molecular-beam {{epitaxial}} overgrowth of GaAs on single <b>ErAs</b> {{layers of}} varying thickness is studied, {{as well as}} the growth of, and strain accommodation in, ErAs/GaAs multilayer films on GaAs substrates. Resonant Raman scattering and Rutherford backscattering are used to characterize the crystal quality of overgrown GaAs layers, while Fourier-transform infrared absorption spectra of the crystal-field-split Er high 3 + intra 4 f-shell transitions, at 1. 54 mym, are exploited as a novel probe of strain accommodation in the <b>ErAs</b> layers. Overgrowth of GaAs of good crystal quality on <b>ErAs,</b> as well as growth of ErAs/GaAs multilayer structures, are both demonstrated, but only for <b>ErAs</b> layers less than about 5 monolayers in thickness.

40|$|A {{detailed}} study is presented of the structural, electrical, and optical properties of <b>ErAs</b> films grown on GaAs by {{molecular beam epitaxy}} (MBE). <b>ErAs</b> layers 1500 A thick were grown successfully over a relatively wide range of substrate temperatures (420 - 580 degrees C), although overgrowth of GaAs on <b>ErAs</b> {{was found to be}} difficult. In-situ reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED), x-ray diffraction, and Rutherford backscattering (RBS) measurements all indicate single crystal growth. Analysis of X-ray rocking curves reveals that, over the range of substrate temperatures studied, strain due to the lattice mismatch between <b>ErAs</b> and GaAs is completely inelastically relieved in the 1500 A thick <b>ErAs</b> layers. Variable-temperature Hall measurements reveal metallic behaviour in all samples, with no pronounced dependence on substrate temperature. Spectrally narrow (0. 6 meV) intra 4 f-shell transitions of Er(high 3 +), at 1. 54 m um, have been observed in <b>ErAs</b> epitaxial layers both in abso rption (by Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy, FTIR) and in emission (by cathodoluminescence).

Key findingsTwo orally active <b>ERAs</b> are currently approved for the treatment of PAH — the dual receptor antagonist bosentan, and the more selective ETA receptor antagonist ambrisentan-based on multicenter randomized clinical trials demonstrating efficacy and safety. Long-term experience with both agents supports maintenance of therapeutic effects in most patients.
