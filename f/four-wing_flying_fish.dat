30|$|Flying {{fish are}} {{important}} traditional fisheries resources in various Caribbean, South East Asian, and Southern Pacific regions and countries (Huang and Ou 2012). In the past, <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> were economically important species for coastal fisheries, with the catch amount reaching the top twenty {{in terms of}} fisheries production in Taiwan. Darkwinged <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> (Cypselurus cyanopyerus), Limpidwing <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> (Cheilopogon unicolor), Spotwing <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> (Cypselurus poecilopterus), and Stained <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> (Cheilopogon spilonotopterus) are the main edible species caught in Taiwan (Huang and Ou 2012). Recently, Staphylococcus xylosus strain Q 2 isolated from dried <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> was a halotolerant histamine-former capable of producing > 500  ppm of histamine in culture broth without shaking at 35  °C for 24  h (Kung et al. 2015). So far, <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> have never been implicated in the outbreaks of scombroid poisoning in the world. However, if the <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> muscle is contaminated with Gram-positive histamine former, such as S. xylosus, and stored at improper temperatures, {{it is important to}} be aware that <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> muscle could become a hazardous food vehicle for histamine poisoning. Currently, no information is available concerning histamine formation in contaminated <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> muscle. This work was undertaken to study the effect of S. xylosus proliferation in <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> muscle on histamine formation and total volatile basic nitrogen (TVBN) under the controlled storage temperatures of − 20, 4, 15, 25, and 35 °C.|$|R
50|$|The ornamented <b>flying</b> <b>fish,</b> or beautyfin <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> (Cypselurus callopterus) , is {{a species}} of <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> of the genus Cypselurus in the family Exocoetidae. The British {{ichthyologist}} Albert Günther first described it in 1866 in his eight-volume Catalogue of Fishes (1859-1870).|$|R
30|$|The {{cultural}} {{characteristics of}} the Tao tribe, such as the <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> festival, canoes, and underground houses, are unique to the Tao tribe in Taiwan; other indigenous tribes in Taiwan do not have such cultural features. The <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> season represents {{the core of the}} life and culture of the Tao tribe; the annual rituals and lifestyles are operated according to the <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> season. The <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> season spans from February to August each year, with several important ceremonies taking place during this period, such as mivanwa (<b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> attracting festival) and manoigoyin (end of eating <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> festival). During the <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> season, the people are not allowed to catch other than the <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> and the common dolphinfish; they also have specific regulations for fishing gear and the number of people allowed to fish. During this period, all tribe members must follow traditional norms and avoid violating the related taboos, i.e., must not interfere with the tribe peoples’ lifestyle or affect their personal social status.|$|R
50|$|The California <b>flying</b> <b>fish,</b> Cheilopogon pinnatibarbatus californicus, is a {{subspecies}} of Pacific <b>flying</b> <b>fish.</b> It {{may grow}} up to 15 inches (38 cm) in length and is the largest member of the <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> family. It {{is found in the}} Eastern Pacific Ocean, from Oregon to Baja California. As with all other <b>flying</b> <b>fish,</b> the California can not actually fly, but it can launch itself into the air, using its specially adapted fins to glide along the surface.|$|R
50|$|Because <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> are {{primarily}} aquatic animals, their body density must {{be close to}} that of water for buoyancy stability. This primary requirement for swimming, however, means that <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> are heavier than other habitual fliers, resulting in higher wing loading and lift to drag ratios for <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> compared to a comparably sized bird. Differences in wing area, wing span, wing loading, and aspect ratio {{have been used to}} classify <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> into two distinct classifications based on these different aerodynamic designs.|$|R
2500|$|Some {{aquatic animals}} also {{regularly}} use gliding, for example, <b>flying</b> <b>fish,</b> octopus and squid. [...] The flights of <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> are typically around 50meters (160ft), though {{they can use}} updrafts {{at the leading edge}} of waves to cover distances of up to [...] [...] To glide upward out of the water, a <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> moves its tail up to 70 times per second.|$|R
40|$|The {{high price}} of <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> eggs in Japan {{encourages}} South Sulawesi fishermen in Indonesia to harvest increasing quantities of eggs every year. Similarly, the increasing local demand for <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> encourages Indonesian fishermen to use gill nets to catch more fish. As a consequence of this increasing quantity of eggs harvested and fish caught, Indonesia has become concerned about the overexploitation of the <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> population. Thus far policy suggestions concerning {{the management of the}} <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> fishery have been based on a static biological model, since the data needed to construct a dynamic bioeconomic model are very limited. This paper presents a method for constructing a dynamic bioeconomic model of the Indonesian <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> fishery with very limited data on the fish population. A calibration technique is developed to build the dynamic biological model. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
50|$|The Australasian <b>flying</b> <b>fish,</b> Cheilopogon pinnatibarbatus melanocercus, is a {{subspecies}} of flyingfish of {{the family}} Exocoetidae, found off New South Wales of Australia, and around New Zealand, in surface waters. The Australasian <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> feeds mainly on plankton and small crustaceans.|$|R
30|$|In this study, it {{demonstrated}} that hazardous levels of histamine could be formed by S. xylosus in <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> meat when stored at temperatures above 15 °C. Flying fish {{may become a}} hazardous food if the <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> meat is contaminated with histamine formers, such as S. xylosus, and exposed to temperatures above 15  °C. However, the formation of histamine by S. xylosus in samples stored at 4 °C after 96  h was negligible. Although histamine was not detected in any frozen samples, it accumulated rapidly in the previously frozen <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> meat and once thawed and stored at 25 °C. It is suggested that <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> meat should be stored below 4  °C to control histamine production.|$|R
30|$|Histamine is {{the main}} causative agent of scombroid poisoning. However, unlike scombroid fish, {{histamine}} poisoning due to consumption of <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> has never been reported. In this study, the white muscle of <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> had high levels of free histidine at approximately 423.9  mg/ 100  g, and was inoculated with Staphylococcus xylosus Q 2 isolated from dried <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> at 5.0 log CFU/g and stored at − 20 to 35 °C to investigate histamine-related quality. The histamine contents quickly increased to higher than 50  mg/ 100  g in samples stored at 25 and 35 °C within 12  h as well as stored at 15 °C within 48  h. However, bacterial growth and histamine formation were controlled by cold storage of the samples at 4 °C or below. Once the frozen <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> samples stored at − 20 °C for 2  months were thawed and stored at 25 °C after 24  h, histamine started to accumulate rapidly (> 50  mg/ 100  g of <b>fish).</b> Therefore, <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> muscle was a good substrate for histamine formation by bacterial histidine decarboxylation at elevated temperatures (> 15 °C) when it is contaminated with S. xylosus. In conclusion, since the improperly contaminated <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> muscle with S. xylosus could lead to production of hazardous levels of histamine over time when stored at temperatures > 15 °C, the <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> should be stored below 4  °C or below to control proliferation of S. xylosus, and TVBN and histamine production.|$|R
60|$|When I {{should have}} headed the Snark {{south-west}} for Hawaii, I still held her south. I {{was going to}} find those <b>flying</b> <b>fish.</b> Finally the time came when, if I wanted to go to Honolulu, I should have headed the Snark due west, instead of which I kept her south. Not until latitude 19 degrees did we encounter the first <b>flying</b> <b>fish.</b> He was very much alone. I saw him. Five other pairs of eager eyes scanned the sea all day, but never saw another. So sparse were the <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> that nearly a week more elapsed before the last one on board saw his first <b>flying</b> <b>fish.</b> As for the dolphin, bonita, porpoise, and all the other hordes of life--there weren't any.|$|R
50|$|In recent times, <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> {{have also}} been gaining in {{popularity}} in other islands, fueling several maritime disputes. In 2006, the council of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea fixed the maritime boundaries between Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago over the <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> dispute, which gradually raised tensions between the neighbours. The ruling stated both countries must preserve stocks for the future. Barbadian fishers still follow the <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> southward. Flying fish remain {{an important part of}} Barbados' main national dish.|$|R

40|$|The author {{observed}} the flying time of <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> Cypselurus agoo {{on board the}} Nagasaki-maru, the training ship of Nagasaki University, {{during the period from}} 4 July to 19 September, 1969. The observation was carried out three times a day, namely 8 - 9 h, 12 - 13 h and 16 - 17 h. Standing on the left corner of bridge and looking at the quarter part (from bow to left midship), the flying time of <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> was counted by stopwatch. Sometimes many fishes flew out from the sea at the same time, and in such a case only one fish was followed. The result is shown in Tables 1, 2 and Fig. 1. It is concluded from Tables 1 and 2 that <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> is distributed more numerously in northern part of the South China Sea and Sulu Sea than in other sea areas. Fig. 1 shows that the peak of flying time of <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> is between 5 - 8 seconds. The average flying time of all <b>flying</b> <b>fishes</b> observed was 6. 5 second...|$|R

40|$|To {{describe}} {{the short term}} relationship between oceanographic conditions and <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> catches and to visualize a spatial pattern of potential fishing grounds in the Flores sea, remotely sensed satellite images of sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll-a concentration, fishing depth and absolute geostrophic current together with catch data were used. Results indicated that the highest <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> catch per unit efforts (CPUEs) occurred in areas of SST 27. 5 - 29. 5 ??C, chlorophyll-a 0. 25 - 0. 70 mg. m- 3 and current velocities 25. 0 - 42. 5 m. s- 1. The fishing depth locations have no significant correlation with the CPUEs. The three preferred oceanographic ranges provided a good indicator for spatially detecting the potential <b>flying</b> <b>fish</b> fishing grounds particularly in the peak season. The predicted potential fishing areas were located in the southwestern Takalar waters approximately 118 ?? 45 ???E- 119 ?? 40 ???E and 5 ?? 30 ???S- 6 ?? 10 ???S and were confirmed by the fishing data. It {{is likely that the}} potential fishing grounds correspond to the occurrence of the oceanographic structures such as upwelling and frontal zones which may be responsible for concentrating the fish schools.
