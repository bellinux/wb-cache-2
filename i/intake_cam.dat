2500|$|There {{were three}} major {{variants}} of the SR20DE {{used in the}} G20. The first, used from July 1990 to December 1993, was the highport, in which the injectors and fuel rail were located above the intake plenum. In January 1994, due to tightening emissions restrictions, Nissan switched to a lowport design, in which the injectors and fuel rail switched places with the intake plenum. This design also featured a milder intake camshaft. (Switching it out for the highport <b>intake</b> <b>cam</b> is a popular upgrade to gain more power.) [...] This design was used from 1994 to 1996 and again in 1998. In 1999 Nissan replaced the valvetrain with a roller-rocker arm lifter design {{in place of the}} hydraulic rocker arm previously used, but kept the lowport intake design; many performance parts are not interchangeable between roller-rocker and highport/lowport engines, most notably camshafts.|$|E
5000|$|This {{ratio is}} higher with more {{conservative}} (i.e., earlier, soon after BDC) <b>intake</b> <b>cam</b> timing, and lower with more radical (i.e., later, long after BDC) <b>intake</b> <b>cam</b> timing, but always {{lower than the}} static or [...] "nominal" [...] compression ratio.|$|E

50|$|The bike {{comes in}} three {{equipment}} levels, the base, the S-Sport and the S-Touring. The S models include ABS (optional on standard model) and electronically adjustable suspension, called DES (Ducati Electronic Suspension). The S Sport model features carbon fiber air <b>intakes,</b> <b>cam</b> belt covers and rear hugger, while the S Touring model comes with heated grips, hard luggage and a center stand.|$|R
5000|$|The Coyote {{features}} all new 4V DOHC {{cylinder heads}} that have shifted the camshafts outboard, which {{allowed for a}} compact roller finger follower setup with remote hydraulic valve lash adjusters and improved (raised) intake port geometry. The result is an intake port that outflows the Ford GT intake port by 4 percent and the Yates D3 (NASCAR) intake port up to 0.472" [...] (12 mm) lift, which is the maximum lift of the Coyote's <b>intake</b> <b>cams.</b> Engine redline is 7000 rpm.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Holley {{continued}} new product introductions with the HP Pro Series race-ready carburetors. During this time Holley also introduced SysteMAX® engine kits that included matched cylinder heads, <b>intakes</b> and <b>cams.</b> The Dominator also {{evolved in the}} 1990s into the HP Dominator; huge billet electric fuel pumps were introduced, and retrofit EFI kits evolved into digital Pro-Jection 4D and 4Di.|$|R
5000|$|Significant {{changes from}} the prior 3200 GT engine were the larger {{displacement}} resulting from an increased cylinder bore diameter and {{the move to}} a naturally aspirated intake that replaced the twin-turbo approach Maserati had used for the previous 20 years, fundamentally because the powertrain is now Ferrari based. [...] The engine operates at a compression ratio of 11.1:1 with the cylinders configured in a 90° V8. The cylinder bore diameter is 92 mm and piston stroke length is 80 mm. [...] The engine shares many of the design features of modern racing engines, including dry sump lubrication, a pump assembly located outside the crankcase, and four valves per cylinder. [...] The 32-valve DOHC utilizes chain-driven, twin-overhead camshafts that provide valve actuation in less than 0.15 seconds, with the <b>intake</b> <b>cams</b> being controlled by variable valve timing. [...] The crankcase and cylinder heads are made from an aluminum and silicon alloy, giving the engine a relatively light weight of 405 lb.|$|R
5000|$|The B5244T4 is a 2.4 L (2,435 cc) straight-five. It is {{turbocharged}} and intercooled with a {{power output}} of [...] at 5000 rpm with 285 Nm of torque at 1500 rpm. It features VVT for both <b>intake</b> and exhaust <b>cam.</b>|$|R
50|$|The engine {{originally}} used {{a two-state}} Variable Valve Timing system to switch the <b>intake</b> <b>cam</b> timing by 30°. Newer variants use {{a more sophisticated}} system which can vary intake timing incrementally up to 48°. The Lincoln version {{was made in the}} United States.|$|E
5000|$|The B4184S2 is a 1.8 L (1,783 cc) straight-four. Bore is 83 mm {{and stroke}} is 82.4 mm. It is {{naturally}} aspirated {{with a power}} output of [...] at 5800 rpm with 170 Nm of torque at 4000 rpm. It features <b>intake</b> <b>cam</b> VVT.|$|E
50|$|Control of a Multiair engine's intake valves works via a {{valve tappet}} (cam follower), moved by a {{mechanical}} <b>intake</b> <b>cam,</b> which {{is connected to}} the intakevalve through a hydraulic chamber, controlled by a normally open on/off solenoid valve.The system allows optimum timing of intake valve operation.|$|E
50|$|The 4B1 {{engine family}} {{is the first to}} have the {{continuously}} variable valve timing MIVEC system applied not only to its intake valves but also to its exhaust valves. The <b>intake</b> and exhaust <b>cam</b> timing is continuously independently controlled and provide four optimized engine operating modes.|$|R
5000|$|The B5244T5 is a 2.4 L (2,401 cc) straight-five. Bore is 81 mm {{and stroke}} is 93.2 mm. It is {{turbocharged}} and intercooled {{with a power}} output of [...] at 5500 rpm with 350 Nm of torque at 2100 rpm. It features VVT for both <b>intake</b> and exhaust <b>cam.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The 23EW {{was built}} in Chihuahua, Mexico for {{transverse}} installation in several front-drive Ford/Mercury/Mazda vehicles through the 2009 model year. [...] "EW" [...] in the Ford designation code denotes East-West configuration, or transverse mounting. Three versions of the 23EW have been produced. A standard DOHC 16V version {{was used in the}} North American Focus producing [...] at 5750 rpm with [...] of torque at 4250 rpm. An iVCT (<b>intake</b> variable <b>cam</b> timing)-equipped DOHC 16V version was used in the 2006-2009 Ford Fusion/Mercury Milan, and several generations of CD2-based crossovers.|$|R
5000|$|The B4164S2 is a 1.6 L (1,587 cc) straight-four. Bore is 81 mm {{and stroke}} is 77 mm with a {{compression}} ratio of 10:1. It is naturally aspirated {{with a power}} output of [...] at 5800 rpm with 145 Nm of torque at 4000 rpm. It features <b>intake</b> <b>cam</b> VVT.|$|E
5000|$|The B5244S4 is a 2.4 L (2,435 cc) straight-five. Bore is 83 mm {{and stroke}} is 90 mm with a {{compression}} ratio of 10.3:1. It is naturally aspirated {{with a power}} output of [...] at 6000 rpm with 230 Nm of torque at 4400 rpm. It features <b>intake</b> <b>cam</b> VVT.|$|E
50|$|A {{dramatic}} {{new look}} was introduced for the 2000 model, with distinctive twin headlights {{and a separate}} ram-air intake replacing the single headlight and integrated intake of the C-model. The engine gained a few horsepower from slightly shorter length CVRD 40 mm carburettors, a compression ratio increase from a lower duration <b>intake</b> <b>cam,</b> which increased cranking compression. Further improvements were aimed primarily at handling.|$|E
50|$|Variable cam timing: Allows {{for control}} {{variable}} <b>intake</b> and exhaust <b>cams</b> (V.V..T), mapping the exact advance/retard curve positioning the camshafts for maximum benefit at all load/rpm {{positions in the}} map. This functionality {{is often used to}} optimize power output at high load/R.P.M.s, and to maximize fuel efficiency and emissions as lower loads/R.P.M.s.|$|R
50|$|One {{difference}} from Hondas VTEC {{system is that}} NEO VVL engages the change of <b>intake</b> and exhaust <b>cams</b> independently for a flatter, more consistent power band. On the SR20VE, the intake camshaft is switched at 5000 rpm, and the exhaust at 6500 rpm. However this trait was not included on the newer 20V version, as both camshafts engage at the same RPM.|$|R
5000|$|The 4GR-FSE is a 2.5 L (2499 cc) version. Bore is 83.0 [...] mm while stroke {{is reduced}} to 77.0 [...] mm with a {{compression}} ratio of 12.0:1. Output is [...] at 6,400 RPM and [...] at 3,800 RPM. This version also features Dual VVT-i, variable valve timing on both the <b>intake</b> and exhaust <b>cams</b> and an improved D4 direct injection system.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the changes}} from the {{previous}} iteration of the Lancer Evolution, was {{the change in the}} engine, the new 4G63 came with MIVEC, Mitsubishi's variable valve lifting technology, which drastically improves the fuel consumption by changing the valve timing on the <b>intake</b> <b>cam.</b> The MIVEC system is similar to Honda's i-VTEC system only that it doesn't change valve lift, only intake valve timing.|$|E
5000|$|The F8-DOHC is a DOHC F8 and {{basically}} a de-stroked {{version of the}} FE-DOHC displacing 1789 cc - 1.8L. It uses the same exhaust cam, but a different <b>intake</b> <b>cam</b> with less lift and a long, single-runner intake manifold. The F8 is usually identified by its unpainted cam cover. Output was 113 hp (84 kW) at 6000 rpm and [...] at 5000 rpm. It is usually found in wagon variants.|$|E
5000|$|The economy i-VTEC K20A3/K24A4 engines is {{more like}} the SOHC VTEC-E in that the <b>intake</b> <b>cam</b> has only two lobes, one very small and one larger, as well as no VTEC on the exhaust cam. The two types of(K20A2)engine are easily {{distinguishable}} by the factory rated power output: the performance engines make around [...] or more in stock form and the economy(K20A3)engines do not make much more than [...] from the factory.|$|E
5000|$|The B5244T7 2.4 L (2,401 cc) straight-five. Bore is 83 mm {{and stroke}} is 90 mm with a {{compression}} ratio of 9.0:1. It is turbocharged and intercooled {{with a power}} output of [...] at 5700 rpm with 285 Nm of torque between 1800-5000 rpm. It features VVT for both <b>intake</b> and exhaust <b>cam.</b> It is equipped with Bosch ME7 engine management.|$|R
50|$|The Coyote is Ford's first {{implementation}} of its cam-torque-actuated (CTA) Twin Independent Variable Cam Timing (Ti-VCT) in a V8 engine, {{which allows the}} power-train control module (PCM) to advance and retard <b>intake</b> and exhaust <b>cam</b> timing independently of each other, providing improved power, fuel economy and reduced emissions. The engine is assembled in Ford's Essex Engine Plant in Windsor, Ontario, using existing Modular tooling.|$|R
5000|$|RennTech Rally Racer is {{a hybrid}} vehicle based on GLK 350 4Matic, built by Renntech, {{inspired}} by the winged, unlimited-class rally cars of Pikes Peak Hill Climb. The engine power was increased to [...] via special <b>intake</b> manifold, <b>cams</b> and cylinder heads, long-tube headers, composite air intake, Renntech ECU software. It also included hybrid system with 72 volt electric motor, 12 volt plug-in batteries. Other features include custom coil-over suspension from KW, Renntech brake combo with 412mm 2-piece rotors with 8-piston front callipers at the front and 356mm discs with 4-pot rear callipers, 20 inch 3-piece, 5-spoke Renntech Sniper Gray wheels with NT05 275/40 20 Nitto front and NT05 315/35 20 rear tires, aerodynamically-tuned body kit.|$|R
