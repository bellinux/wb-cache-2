5|$|In a 2015 study, {{high-quality}} genome sequences {{from three}} Asian elephants and two woolly mammoths were compared. Approximately 1.4 million DNA nucleotide {{differences were found}} between mammoths and elephants, which affect the sequence of more than 1,600 proteins. Differences were noted in genes for a number of aspects of physiology and biology that would be relevant to Arctic survival, including development of skin and hair, storage and metabolism of adipose tissue, and perceiving temperature. Genes related to both sensing temperature and transmitting that sensation to the brain were altered. One of the <b>heat-sensing</b> genes encodes a protein, TRPV3, found in skin which also affects hair growth. When inserted into human cells, the mammoth's version of the protein was found to be less sensitive to heat than the elephant's. This is consistent with a previous observation that mice lacking active TRPV3 are likely to spend more time in cooler cage locations than wild type mice, and have wavier hair. There were also several alterations in circadian clock genes, perhaps needed to cope with the extreme polar variation in length of daylight. Similar mutations are known in other Arctic mammals, such as reindeer.|$|E
2500|$|The {{adults are}} not large, ranging from [...] in length. The color pattern {{consists}} of a grey or tan ground color with a row of large rounded brown/black blotches or spots {{down the center of}} the back and three smaller rows of alternating spots down each side. Solid black melanistic examples are also known, as well as cases where the back blotches join with those on the sides. Young massasauga are well-patterned but paler than the adults. It has <b>heat-sensing</b> pits on each side of its smallish head, the scales are keeled and the anal scale is single.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ability to}} sense {{infrared}} thermal radiation evolved independently in various families of snakes. Essentially, it allows these reptiles to [...] "see" [...] radiant heat at wavelengths between 5 and 30 μm {{to a degree}} of accuracy such that a blind rattlesnake can target vulnerable body parts of the prey at which it strikes. It was previously thought that the organs evolved primarily as prey detectors, but it is now believed that {{it may also be}} used in thermoregulatory decision making. The facial pit underwent parallel evolution in pitvipers and some boas and pythons, having evolved once in pitvipers and multiple times in boas and pythons. The electrophysiology of the structure is similar between the two lineages, but they differ in gross structural anatomy. Most superficially, pitvipers possess one large pit organ {{on either side of the}} head, between the eye and the nostril (Loreal pit), while boas and pythons have three or more comparatively smaller pits lining the upper and sometimes the lower lip, in or between the scales. Those of the pitvipers are the more advanced, having a suspended sensory membrane as opposed to a simple pit structure. Within the family Viperidae, the pit organ is seen only in the subfamily Crotalinae: the pitvipers. The organ is used extensively to detect and target endothermic prey such as rodents and birds, and it was previously assumed that the organ evolved specifically for that purpose. However, recent evidence shows that the pit organ may also be used for thermoregulation. According to Krochmal et al., pitvipers can use their pits for thermoregulatory decision making while true vipers (vipers who do not contain <b>heat-sensing</b> pits) cannot.|$|E
5|$|The {{human brain}} is {{provided}} with information about light, sound, the chemical composition of the atmosphere, temperature, head orientation, limb position, the chemical composition of the bloodstream, and more. In other animals additional senses are present, such as the infrared <b>heat-sense</b> of snakes, the magnetic field sense of some birds, or the electric field sense of some types of fish.|$|R
50|$|Sensory {{deprivation}} (Sendep) or {{perceptual isolation}} is the deliberate reduction or removal of stimuli {{from one or}} more of the senses. Simple devices such as blindfolds or hoods and earmuffs can cut off sight and hearing, while more complex devices can also cut off the sense of smell, touch, taste, thermoception (<b>heat-sense),</b> and 'gravity'. Sensory deprivation has been used in various alternative medicines and in psychological experiments (e.g. with an isolation tank).|$|R
50|$|It is {{the only}} snake, found in Pakistan, with a pit (<b>heat-sensing</b> loreal pit) between the eye and nostril.|$|E
50|$|It is both {{terrestrial}} and arboreal, {{using its}} prehensile tail {{to hold onto}} branches. The <b>heat-sensing</b> loreal pits are used to locate warm-blooded prey.|$|E
50|$|Water snakes are non-venomous and {{harmless}} to humans, but superficially {{resemble the}} venomous Water Moccasin {{and are often}} killed un-necessarily {{as a result of}} this mistaken identity. The two can be easily distinguished by morphological traits: the water snake has a longer, more slender body and a flattened head the same width as the neck with round pupils and no <b>heat-sensing</b> pits. The Water Moccasin has a fatter body, a wedge-shaped head with prominent venom glands that is wider than the neck, cat-like pupils and <b>heat-sensing</b> pits between the eyes and the nostrils.|$|E
50|$|Using its <b>heat-sensing</b> facial pits {{to locate}} prey, C. oreganus eats birds, bird eggs, and small mammals, from mice {{up to and}} {{including}} rabbits. It also eats small reptiles and amphibians. The juveniles eat insects.|$|E
50|$|Police {{departments}} and {{other law enforcement}} agencies use helicopters to pursue suspects. Since helicopters can achieve a unique aerial view, they are often {{used in conjunction with}} police on the ground to report on suspects' locations and movements. They are often mounted with lighting and <b>heat-sensing</b> equipment for night pursuits.|$|E
50|$|Adult corn snakes have a {{body length}} of 61 - 182 cm. In the wild, they usually live around 6-8 years, but in captivity can live to an age of 23 years or more. They can be {{distinguished}} from Copperhead snakes by their brighter colors, slender build and lack of <b>heat-sensing</b> pits.|$|E
50|$|In June 2014, the Canadian National Aerial Surveillance Program DHC-8M-100 {{aircraft}} {{mounted with}} infrared sensors {{was instrumental in}} the search for Justin Bourque, a fugitive who had killed three Royal Canadian Mounted Police members in Moncton. The plane's crew used its advanced <b>heat-sensing</b> camera to discover Bourque's heat signature in the deep brushwoods at midnight.|$|E
50|$|The Viperinae, or viperines, are a {{subfamily}} of venomous vipers {{endemic to}} Europe, Asia and Africa. They are distinguished by {{their lack of}} the <b>heat-sensing</b> pit organs that characterize their sister group, the subfamily Crotalinae. Currently, 12 genera and 66 species are recognized. Most are tropical and subtropical, although one species, Vipera berus, even occurs within the Arctic Circle.|$|E
50|$|William T. Kane (September 8, 1932 - September 23, 2008) was a {{physicist}} for Corning Incorporated, formerly Corning Glass Works, Inc., in Corning, New York, who held patents in crystallography and <b>heat-sensing</b> technology—developments which {{contributed to the}} early processing and manufacture of fiber optics. He was also the Corning representative {{for the establishment of}} international standards in the use of fiber optics in communications.|$|E
5000|$|Like all pit vipers, rattlesnakes {{have two}} organs that can sense {{radiation}}: their eyes, {{and a set}} of <b>heat-sensing</b> [...] "pits" [...] on their faces that enable them to locate prey and move towards it, based on the prey's thermal radiation signature. These pits have a relatively short effective range of about 1 ft, but give the rattlesnake a distinctive advantage in hunting for warm-blooded creatures at night.|$|E
50|$|Rainbow boas, {{like all}} boas in the Boidae family, are non-venomous snakes that subdue their prey with constriction. Like most Boids, they have special <b>heat-sensing</b> pits {{on their faces}} {{that allow them to}} detect the body heat of their warm-blooded prey. While nocturnal, they may bask during the day when night-time {{temperatures}} are low. They are active at dawn and dusk and feed on small mammals, birds and lizards using their <b>heat-sensing</b> abilities to hunt in the low light. Most rainbow boas will never need a prey item larger than a large rat, as with most snakes, rainbow boas can expand their jaw to allow the consuming of items larger than the jaw would normally open (see snake skull). Wild rainbow boas may bite when they feel threatened, as a defense. This bite can be painful, but is not dangerous. Care must still be taken against infection. Like all snakes, when in a shed cycle they will be more unpredictable and irritable due to the added stress of shedding and clouded sight.|$|E
50|$|A {{species of}} the family Pythonidae, non-venomous snakes that traps and asphyxiates prey. It is {{contained}} by a group without well developed <b>heat-sensing</b> pits, these are only found at the lips. Small and terrestrial, adults grow up to about 110 cm in length. They have 35-49 rows of dorsal scales at midbody, 240-305 ventral scales and 30-45 subcaudal scales. The subcaudals are mostly or entirely divided, while the anal scale is single.|$|E
50|$|Condensed aerosol {{devices are}} {{designed}} to provide a controlled discharge. The aerosol-forming compound is installed inside of the device, which is then fitted with an electric or mechanical initiator. The electric initiator is interfaced with a fire detection control unit or panel, which can be remotely operated by physical means such as by cable, hand operated with a fuse mechanism such as those used in smoke dispensing grenades, or automatic and self-triggering when outfitted with an integral <b>heat-sensing</b> device.|$|E
50|$|Adults grow to {{an average}} snout-vent length (SVL) of 65-70 cm (25.6-27.6 inches). Scalation {{includes}} 23 rows of dorsal scales at midbody, an average of 157 ventral scales, and an average of 41 paired subcaudal scales. Also, the second supralabial scale is low and does not form the anterior margin of the <b>heat-sensing</b> loreal pit. The color pattern consists of a grayish brown ground color overlaid {{with a series of}} dark brown X-shaped markings. A postocular stripe is present that is very narrow and very dark in color.|$|E
50|$|The {{adults are}} not large, ranging from 60 to 75 cm in length. The color pattern {{consists}} of a grey or tan ground color with a row of large rounded brown/black blotches or spots {{down the center of}} the back and three smaller rows of alternating spots down each side. Solid black melanistic examples are also known, as well as cases where the back blotches join with those on the sides. Young massasauga are well-patterned but paler than the adults. It has <b>heat-sensing</b> pits on each side of its smallish head, the scales are keeled and the anal scale is single.|$|E
5000|$|Tiger rattlesnakes are {{terrestrial}} {{snakes and}} are nocturnal during the hot summer (June-August), but become diurnal and crepuscular {{during the fall}} season. They hibernate during the late fall and winter in rock crevices or animal burrows. In spite of being ground-dwelling, their activity is not restricted to the ground. They swim readily and {{have been found in}} bushes 60 cm above the ground. [...] Little information is available concerning communication and perception among tiger rattlesnakes. However, like other pit vipers, tiger rattlesnakes have <b>heat-sensing</b> pits (located {{on each side of the}} face between the eye and nostril) to detect warm-blooded predators and prey.|$|E
50|$|Having {{been told}} by Harry about the access tunnel, Catherine visits the storage {{facility}} under the pier to look around just as Harry brings Piantadosi with him to investigate. They find all 16 of the creature's partially eaten victims, including Ruth's severed head, parts of Marie's body and Hoagy's fresh corpse. Captain Pearson arrives with the police, who remove all of the bodies. Pearson orders the officers to use a backhoe and equipment to track the monster down. Increased attention from the local news media lead the police to attempt to kill the creature as quickly as possible, and Pearson orders the installation of motion detectors, <b>heat-sensing</b> cameras and explosives.|$|E
50|$|Many {{essential}} oils affect {{the skin and}} mucous membranes {{in ways that are}} valuable or harmful. Many {{essential oils}}, particularly tea tree oil, may cause contact dermatitis. They are used in antiseptics and liniments in particular. Typically, they produce rubefacient irritation at first and then counterirritant numbness. Turpentine oil and camphor are two typical examples of oils that cause such effects. Menthol and some others produce a feeling of cold followed by a sense of burning. This is caused by its effect on <b>heat-sensing</b> nerve endings. Some essential oils, such as clove oil or eugenol, were popular for many hundred years in dentistry as antiseptics and local anesthetics.|$|E
50|$|Although the <b>heat-sensing</b> pits that {{characterize}} the Crotalinae are clearly lacking in the viperines, a supernasal sac with sensory function has been described {{in a number of}} species. This sac is an invagination of the skin between the supranasal and nasal scales and is connected to the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve. The nerve endings here resemble those in the labial pits of boas. The supernasal sac is present in the genera Daboia, Pseudocerastes and Causus, but is especially well developed in the genus Bitis. Experiments have shown that strikes are not only guided by visual and chemical cues, but also by heat, with warmer targets being struck more frequently than colder ones.|$|E
50|$|Assistance from {{firefighting}} agencies as {{far north}} as the Oregon state line, as far south as Bakersfield and as far east as the Nevada state line were quickly mobilized and sent to the fire zone. The California Department of Forestry (CDF) dispatched several air tankers, which doused the fire with tons of fire retardant all day long. The CDF established a base at the Naval Air Station in Alameda. Additionally, the Naval Air Station itself sent its own firefighting equipment and material {{to the scene of the}} fire. The next morning, before full control had been gained, satellite photographs, especially infrared (<b>heat-sensing)</b> photographs, were provided with the help of NASA Ames Research Center's Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team (DART) to aid firefighters in plotting the extent of the fire and spotting hidden hot spots.|$|E
50|$|The Crotalinae, {{commonly}} known as pit vipers, crotaline snakes (named for the κρόταλον krotalon castanet/rattle of a rattlesnake's tail), or pit adders, are a subfamily of venomous vipers found in Eurasia and the Americas. They are distinguished {{by the presence of}} a <b>heat-sensing</b> pit organ located between the eye and the nostril {{on either side of the}} head. Currently, 18 genera and 151 species are recognized: seven genera and 54 species in the Old World, against a greater diversity of 11 genera and 97 species in the New World. These are also the only viperids found in the Americas. The groups of snakes represented here include rattlesnakes, lanceheads, and Asian pit vipers. The type genus for this subfamily is Crotalus, of which the type species is the timber rattlesnake, C. horridus.|$|E
50|$|On September 9, 2009, Dell previewed a thinner Adamo XPS laptop design, {{which was}} 9.99 mm (0.39 inches) thick. It was {{released}} on November 5, 2009 and priced at USD 1,799. The laptop's bottom half, containing the keyboard, is smaller than {{the top half of}} the laptop containing the screen. The screen half is concave, so when shut the keyboard embeds itself into the screen. It is designed, that when open, the bottom of the screen half and the edge of the keyboard, make contact with the surface on which it is resting. The Adamo XPS has a <b>heat-sensing</b> strip on the lip of its lid which, when touched, opens the lid. Internally, it has either a 128 GB solid-state drive or a 180 GB hard drive. It uses 4GB of DDR3 memory and a 1.4 GHz Intel ULV (ultra low voltage) processor. The battery can run either 4 or 5 hours, depending on configuration.|$|E
5000|$|Proponents {{argue that}} {{government}} has sufficient safeguards in place so that individuals can challenge seizures if the need arises. Justice William H. Rehnquist {{said in a}} Supreme Court decision that federal forfeiture in drug-related cases was not a punishment but served nonpunitive purposes such as encouraging people to be careful that their property was not used illegally. A lobbyist for the Maryland State Police named Thomas Williams argued that bills to require police to keep better records of seized property would cost law enforcement more time and money, and that trying to track seizures by multi-agency task forces would not be easy. Proponents say that when claimants contest the seizures, they rarely win back their money, suggesting that the [...] "system is working properly." [...] Proponents say the system is monitored to make sure seizures are properly done. In addition, the funds enable police forces to equip themselves further for more effective crime prevention; for example, a $3.8 million drug bust let officers equip their cars with $1,700 video cameras and <b>heat-sensing</b> equipment for a seven-member force.|$|E

5000|$|Timor pythons are {{a fairly}} long (7 + feet) but {{relatively}} thin python species from the Lesser Sunda Islands in Indonesia. Ironically, {{there are no}} known records of Timor Pythons from the Island of Timor. This probably stems from the misidentification of a Macklot's Python (Liasis mackloti) that is similar in appearance and does occur on that island. This is a very fast-moving, highly defensive snake that spends {{a great deal of}} time in the trees hunting for prey. Like many python species, Timor pythons have a series of <b>heat-sensing</b> pits between their nostrils and mouth used to find warm-blooded prey in total darkness. They are egg-layers, but instead of laying the eggs and leaving, they remain coiled around the clutch for the entire incubation period. This maternal incubation serves two purposes: protection of the eggs is one, and temperature regulation is the other. Through a series of twitches and contractions many python species can raise the temperature of their bodies by as much as eight degrees F. Loosening the coils and exposing the eggs to more air circulation does the opposite. This is a fairly remarkable achievement given that snakes are [...] "cold-blooded", meaning that their body temperature is dictated by their surroundings.|$|E
