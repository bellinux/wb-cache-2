5|$|After his inauguration, Obama {{announced}} {{to a joint}} session of Congress in February 2009 his intent to work with Congress to construct a plan for <b>healthcare</b> <b>reform.</b> By July, a series of bills were approved by committees within the House of Representatives. On the Senate side, from June to September, the Senate Finance Committee held a series of 31 meetings to develop a <b>healthcare</b> <b>reform</b> bill. This group—in particular, Democrats Max Baucus, Jeff Bingaman and Kent Conrad, along with Republicans Mike Enzi, Chuck Grassley and Olympia Snowe—met for more than 60 hours, and the principles that they discussed, in conjunction with the other committees, became the foundation of the Senate <b>healthcare</b> <b>reform</b> bill.|$|E
5|$|By 2008 many Democrats were {{considering}} this approach {{as the basis}} for <b>healthcare</b> <b>reform.</b> Experts said that the legislation that eventually emerged from Congress in 2009 and 2010 bore similarities to the 2007 bill and that it was deliberately patterned after Romney's state healthcare plan.|$|E
5|$|Negotiations were {{undertaken}} {{attempting to}} satisfy moderate Democrats {{and to bring}} Republican senators aboard; particular attention was given to Republicans Bennett, Enzi, Grassley and Snowe. On July 7 Franken was sworn into office, providing a potential 60th vote. On August 25 Ted Kennedy—a longtime <b>healthcare</b> <b>reform</b> advocate—died. Paul Kirk was appointed as Senator Kennedy's temporary replacement on September 24.|$|E

5|$|As First Lady of the United States, Clinton was an {{advocate}} for gender equality and <b>healthcare</b> <b>reform.</b> Her marital relationship came under public scrutiny during the Lewinsky scandal, which led to her issuing a statement reaffirming her commitment to the marriage. In 2000, Clinton was elected as the first female Senator from New York. She was re-elected to the Senate in 2006. Running for president in 2008, she won far more delegates than any previous female candidate, but lost the Democratic nomination to Barack Obama.|$|E
5|$|Health care {{delivery}} in Nigeria is a concurrent {{responsibility of the}} three tiers of government in the country, and the private sector. Nigeria has been reorganising its health system since the Bamako Initiative of 1987, which formally promoted community-based methods of increasing accessibility of drugs and health care services to the population, in part by implementing user fees. The new strategy dramatically increased accessibility through community-based <b>healthcare</b> <b>reform,</b> resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of services.|$|E
5|$|<b>Healthcare</b> <b>reform</b> {{was a major}} topic {{during the}} 2008 Democratic presidential primaries. As the race narrowed, {{attention}} focused on the plans presented by the two leading candidates, Hillary Clinton and the eventual nominee, Barack Obama. Each candidate proposed a plan to cover the approximately 45million Americans estimated to not have health insurance at some point each year. Clinton's proposal would have required all Americans to obtain coverage (in effect, an individual mandate), while Obama's proposal provided a subsidy but rejected {{the use of an}} individual mandate.|$|E

25|$|A 'White Paper' on {{proposed}} <b>healthcare</b> <b>reforms</b> {{had been}} prepared by the previous government, and resulted in the 1947 Health Act. In February 1948 Browne became Minister for Health and started the reforms advocated by the Paper and introduced by the Act.|$|R
5|$|President Bill Clinton {{proposed}} a <b>healthcare</b> <b>reform</b> bill in 1993 {{that included a}} mandate for employers to provide health insurance to all employees through a regulated marketplace of health maintenance organizations. Republican Senators {{proposed a}}n alternative that would have required individuals, but not employers, to buy insurance. Ultimately the Clinton plan failed amid an unprecedented barrage of negative advertising funded by politically conservative groups and the health insurance industry and due to concerns that it was overly complex. Clinton negotiated a compromise with the 105th Congress to instead enact the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) in 1997.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} mandate {{coupled with}} subsidies for private insurance {{as a means}} for universal healthcare was considered the best way to win the support of the Senate because it had been included in prior bipartisan reform proposals. The concept goes back to at least 1989, when the conservative The Heritage Foundation proposed an individual mandate as an alternative to single-payer health care. It was championed for a time by conservative economists and Republican senators as a market-based approach to <b>healthcare</b> <b>reform</b> on the basis of individual responsibility and avoidance of free rider problems. Specifically, because the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires any hospital participating in Medicare (nearly all do) to provide emergency care to anyone who needs it, the government often indirectly bore the cost of those without the ability to pay.|$|E
5|$|Mathews {{began her}} career in 1990 as an {{associate}} at the New York consulting firm McKinsey & Company. In 1992 Mathews joined Bill Clinton's presidential campaign and led the economic team for the president-elect. Following Clinton's inauguration, Mathews, with Robert Rubin, helped set up the National Economic Council (NEC). She served as Staff Director of the NEC from 1993 to 1995. While Mathews was at NEC, the White House pushed for <b>healthcare</b> <b>reform.</b> Mathews was among those in the administration who advocated for finding ways, apart from legislation, to curb healthcare costs. When Rubin became Secretary of the Treasury in 1995, Mathews became his Chief of Staff. She testified before a Senate Committee during the Whitewater investigations regarding her search of Vince Foster's garbage {{and the fate of}} the documents she discovered. Mathews told the committee she had been looking for an indication as to why Foster had committed suicide and denied ordering any documents destroyed.|$|E

5|$|The Senate {{began work}} on its own {{proposals}} while the House was still working. The United States Constitution requires all revenue-related bills to originate in the House. To formally comply with this requirement, the Senate used H.R. 3590, a bill regarding housing tax changes for service members. It had been passed by the House as a revenue-related modification to the Internal Revenue Code. The bill became the Senate's vehicle for its <b>healthcare</b> <b>reform</b> proposal, discarding the bill's original content. The bill ultimately incorporated elements of proposals that were reported favorably by the Senate Health and Finance committees. With the Republican Senate minority vowing to filibuster, 60 votes {{would be necessary to}} pass the Senate. At the start of the 111th Congress, Democrats had only 58 votes; the Senate seat in Minnesota ultimately won by Al Franken was still undergoing a recount, while Arlen Specter was still a Republican (he became a Democrat in April, 2009).|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} {{policy of the}} Barack Obama administration was characterized by moderate tax increases on higher income Americans designed to fund <b>healthcare</b> <b>reform,</b> reduce the federal budget deficit, and improve income inequality. His first term (2009–2013) included measures designed to address the Great Recession and Subprime mortgage crisis, which began in 2007.

40|$|This article {{considers}} the United States Supreme Court’s ruling in National Federation of Independent Business et al v Sebelius, which questioned {{the constitutionality of}} President Obama’s signature <b>healthcare</b> <b>reforms</b> of 2009, which have become colloquially known as ‘Obamacare’. Although the Supreme Court upheld the Act as constitutional, this article contends that the Supreme Court’s reasoning {{can be read as}} another battle in the long-standing debate in American politics over the correct size and limits of the Federal Government. In upholding the <b>healthcare</b> <b>reforms</b> as a tax, rather than under the Constitution’s Commerce Clause, the Supreme Court has endorsed a view of limited government in line with the principles of classical liberalism. This has the potential to greatly restrict the scope of the Federal Government to pursue large scale expansive social welfare programmes in the future...|$|R

25|$|A CNN {{report has}} stated that the {{proposed}} public option is a 'lightning rod' in American public opinion about <b>healthcare</b> <b>reform.</b> Republicans, people with the insurance industry, and employer groups have discussed the concern that {{the availability of a}} public plan would make it difficult for private insurers to compete. This may then lead to a situation where most people end up being covered by the public insurance option.|$|E
25|$|The cost of {{insurance}} has been a primary motivation in the reform of the US healthcare system, and many different explanations have been proposed in the reasons for high insurance costs and how to remedy them. One critique and motivation for <b>healthcare</b> <b>reform</b> has been {{the development of the}} medical–industrial complex. This relates to moral arguments for health care reform, framing healthcare as a social good, one that is fundamentally immoral to deny to people based on economic status. The motivation behind <b>healthcare</b> <b>reform</b> in response to the medical-industrial complex also stems from issues of social inequity, promotion of medicine over preventative care. The medical-industrial complex, defined as a network of health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, and the like, plays a role in the complexity of the US insurance market and a fine line between government and industry within it. Likewise, critiques {{of insurance}} markets being conducted under a capitalistic, free-market model also include that medical solutions, as opposed to preventative healthcare measures, are promoted to maintain this medical-industrial complex. Arguments for a market-based approach to health insurance include the Grossman model, which is based on an ideal competitive model, but others have critiqued this, arguing that fundamentally, this means that people in higher socioeconomic levels will receive a better quality of healthcare.|$|E

40|$|The paper compares <b>healthcare</b> <b>reforms</b> in China, South Korea, Singapore and Thailand {{with the}} purpose of drawing useable lessons about the {{appropriate}} role of the state in the sector. It argues that <b>healthcare</b> <b>reforms</b> in China and Korea offer many negative lessons for healthcare reformers while Singapore and Thailand offer positive lessons that may be considered for emulation elsewhere. The fundamental lesson to emerge from the successful reform experiences is that a large and active state role in various aspects of healthcare provision and financing is essential for containing expenditures and maintaining access. Public ownership of providers and prospective payments are particularly effective in controlling expenditures while direct government financing promotes equitable access. The cases also show that political economy matters: the Singapore and Thai states' strong presence in the healthcare sector is a vital reason for their superior performance. © 2008 Policy and Society Associates (APSS). link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This article aims {{to compare}} {{statutory}} health insurance policy during the dental <b>healthcare</b> <b>reforms</b> in Germany and Japan. Germany and Japan have categorized their statutory health insurance systems. People {{in both countries}} have been provided with a wide coverage of dental treatment and prosthetics. To compare the trends of the indicators of oral healthcare systems over time, {{it has been suggested}} that the strategic allocation of dental expenditure is more important than the amount of expense. German dental healthcare policy has shifted under political and socio-economic pressures towards a cost-effective model. In contrast, Japanese <b>healthcare</b> <b>reforms</b> have focused on keeping the basic statutory health insurance scheme, whereby individuals share more of the cost of statutory health insurance. As a result, Germany has succeeded in dramatically decreasing the prevalence of dental caries among children. On comparing the dental conditions of both countries, the rate of decline in replacement of missing teeth among adults and the elderly in Germany and Japan has been interpreted as indicating the price-conscious demands of prosthetics. The difference in the decline of DMFT in 12 -year-olds in Germany and Japan could be described as being due to the dental health insurance policy being shifted from treatment-oriented to preventive-oriented in Germany. These findings suggest that social health insurance provides people with equal opportunity for dental services, and <b>healthcare</b> <b>reforms</b> have improved people's oral health. A mixed coverage of social health insurance coverage for dental care should be reconsidered in Japan...|$|R
