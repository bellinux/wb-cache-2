50|$|The Swedish {{approach}} {{is different from}} purely self-administered self-help since it combines the advantages of structured self-help materials with the provision of guidance by an identified therapist. In particular, {{the role of the}} therapist is highlighted in the treatment trials conducted by Professor Andersson and his group. The therapist provides support, encouragement, motivation, and answers to patient's questions. Hence, the cognitive-behavioural treatment resembles rather a live treatment than a pure self-help treatment, but is provided via the Internet. A similar way to deliver Internet treatment has been endorsed by other researchers across the world. Despite the important role of the therapist, Internet-delivered treatments require much less therapist time than conventional CBT. Furthermore, Internet-based CBT allows patients to work at their own pace whenever they find the time to work on the material. This procedure gives a lot of responsibility to the patient, which can be helpful for the final treatment outcome. Several studies conducted by Andersson and his colleagues show a high efficacy of the <b>Internet-based</b> <b>treatment</b> approach for very different disorders, e.g. depression, social anxiety, and tinnitus.Current studies of the group compare the efficacy of Internet-delivered CBT with traditional CBT approaches, e.g. face-to-face treatment, group therapy. Due to Andersson's studies on Internet-based approaches to deliver psychotherapy, Sweden is world leading in online-based treatments. The research has generated quite a lot of media attention in Sweden, but also in other countries. Research on psychological treatments on the Internet is available from several other research groups as well.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the major}} reasons that internet-based {{psychological}} treatments are strongly advocated {{is the belief that}} they may enable consumers to overcome many of the barriers to treatment otherwise encountered in seeking face to face treatment. A corollary to this belief is the assumption that many consumers may then be more likely to prefer to receive treatment via the internet because of the reduced barriers to care offered by internet-based treatments. However, there has been no formal examination of the barriers perceived by consumers to internet-based treatments in comparison to face to face treatment to ascertain whether these hypothesized differences impact on treatment preferences. This study compared consumer perceptions of barriers to treatment for both internet and face-to-face psychological treatments for depression. Of interest was whether consumers continue to report a preference for face-to-face treatment over <b>internet-based</b> <b>treatment,</b> even if perceptions of barriers to care were deemed greater for traditional than internet based delivery of services. Potential consumers of a structured online psychological program for workplace depression were targeted. An online survey was accessed by fifty-three employed individuals (female = 35, male = 18) with ages ranging from 18 to 60 (M = 35. 57, SD = 12. 15). Results indicated that participants perceived that <b>internet-based</b> <b>treatment</b> was associated with fewer barriers than face-to-face treatment for depression. Participants perceived that time constraints and participation restrictions would {{make it more difficult to}} access face-to-face treatment than <b>internet-based</b> <b>treatment.</b> However, the participants reported that they would be more likely to access face-to-face treatment for depression than <b>internet-based</b> <b>treatment.</b> These results suggest that there is a need to further investigate ways in which consumers can be encouraged to consider engaging in <b>internet-based</b> <b>treatment.</b> Griffith Health, School of Applied PsychologyNo Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{effectiveness}} of <b>Internet-based</b> <b>treatments</b> for depression has been demonstrated; their cost-effectiveness, however, {{has been less}} well researched. Objective: Evaluating the relative cost-utility and cost-{{effectiveness of}} (1) Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy, (2) Internet-based problem-solving therapy, and (3) a waiting list for adults with depressive symptoms. Methods: A total of 263 participants with clinically significant depressive symptoms were randomized to Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (n = 88), Internet-based problem-solving therapy (n = 88), and a waiting list (n = 87). End points were evaluated at the 12 -week follow-up. Results: Cost-utility analysis showed that cognitive behavioral therapy and problem-solving therapy had a 52 % and 61 % probability respectively of being more acceptable than waiting when the willingness to pay is € 30, 000 for one quality-adjusted life-year. When society is prepared to pay € 10, 000 for a clinically significant change from depression, the probabilities of cognitive behavioral therapy and problem-solving therapy being more acceptable than waiting are 91 % and 89 %, respectively. Comparing both <b>Internet-based</b> <b>treatments</b> showed no clear preference for {{one or the other}} of the <b>treatments.</b> Conclusions: Both <b>Internet-based</b> <b>treatments</b> have a high probability of being cost-effective with a modest value placed on clinically significant change in depressive symptoms...|$|R

40|$|Background: Obsessive-compulsive {{disorder}} (OCD) is a disabling anxiety disorder, {{but most}} individuals delay seeking treatment. Internet-based {{cognitive behavioural therapy}} (iCBT) is an innovative service delivery method that may help to improve access to care, but the acceptability to consumers of such programs {{has not yet been}} established. Methodology: People with symptoms of OCD were invited to complete an online survey enquiring about demographic characteristics, symptom severity, and acceptability of <b>Internet-based</b> <b>treatment.</b> Demographic and symptom severity data were compared with people with OCD identified in a national epidemiological survey and with a sample of patients with OCD from a specialist outpatient anxiety clinic. Participants: 129 volunteers to an online Internet survey, 135 patients at a specialist anxiety disorders outpatient clinic, and 297 cases identified in a national epidemiological survey. Main Measures: Demographic characteristics, and severity of symptoms as measured by the Kessler 10 -Item scale, the 12 -item World Health Organisation Disability Assessment Schedule - Second Edition and the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale - Self Report Version. Principal Findings: The Internet sample was similar demographically but reported more severe symptoms than the comparison groups, although had similar severity of symptoms of OCD compared with other clinical samples reported in the literature. Participants reported <b>Internet-based</b> <b>treatment</b> for OCD would be highly acceptable. Conclusions: <b>Internet-based</b> <b>treatment</b> may reduce barriers to accessing treatment to people with OCD.

30|$|Another {{limitation}} of <b>Internet-based</b> <b>treatments</b> for psychological disorders, delivered via computers, {{is that they}} tend to be text-based, often reaching close to 200 pages of reading ([Bendelin et al. 2011]). Smartphone applications tend to be more user-friendly and condensed than regular web pages (for example the difference between a smartphone application for a newspaper and web pages for the same newspaper), which could be an attractive feature for persons with low-literacy skills, who need encouragement to work through the program ([Andersson et al. 2007]). The encouraging aspect is important, as guidance appear to be crucial in order to prevent dropout from guided self-help treatments ([Christensen et al. 2006 a 2006 b]), which was recently confirmed in a meta-analysis ([Cuijpers et al. 2010]). The current intervention is based on our previous experiences with <b>Internet-based</b> depression <b>treatment</b> ([Cuijpers et al. 2010]; [Andersson et al. 2011]; [Andersson et al. 2005]; [Bendelin et al. 2011]; [Holländare et al. 2011]; [Meyer et al. 2009]; [Vernmark et al. 2010]).

The objective of the present systematic review is to evaluate internet-based interventions for persons with chronic pain. The specific aims are to do an updated review with a broad inclusion of different chronic pain diagnoses and to assess disability and pain and also measures of catastrophizing, depression and anxiety. A systematic search identified 891 studies and 22 trials were selected as eligible for review. Two of the selected trials included children/youth and five included individuals with chronic headache and/or migraine. The most frequently measured domain reflected in the primary outcomes was interference/disability, followed by catastrophizing. Result across the studies showed a number of beneficial effects. Twelve trials reported significant effects on disability/interference outcomes and pain intensity. Positive effects were also found on psychological variable such as catastrophizing, depression and anxiety. Several studies (n =  12) were assessed to have an unclear level of risk bias.

40|$|Background: Recent studies provide {{evidence}} for the effectiveness of <b>Internet-based</b> maintenance <b>treatments</b> for mental disorders. However, it is still unclear which participants {{might or might not}} profit from this particular kind of treatment delivery. Objective: The study aimed to identify moderators of treatment outcome in a transdiagnostic <b>Internet-based</b> maintenance <b>treatment</b> (TIMT) offered to patients after inpatient psychotherapy for mental disorders in routine care. Methods: Using data from a randomized controlled trial (N= 400) designed to test the effectiveness of TIMT, we performed secondary analyses to identify factors moderating the effects of TIMT (intervention) when compared with those of a treatment-as-usual control condition. TIMT involved an online self-management module, asynchronous patient-therapist communication, a peer support group, and online-based progress monitoring. Participants in the control condition had unstructured access to outpatient psychotherapy, standardized outpatient face-to-face continuation treatment, and psychotropic management. Self-reports of psychopathological symptoms and potential moderators were assessed at the start of inpatient treatment (T 1), at discharge from inpatient treatment/start of TIMT (T 2), and at 3 -month (T 3) and 12 -month follow-up (T 4). Results: Education level, positive outcome expectations, and diagnoses significantly moderated intervention versus control differences regarding changes in outcomes between T 2 and T 3. Only education level moderated change differences between T 2 and T 4. The effectiveness of the intervention (vs control) was more pronounced among participants with a low (vs high) education level (T 2 -T 3 : B=- 0. 32, SE 0. 16, P=. 049; T 2 -T 4 : B=- 0. 42, SE 0. 21, P=. 049), participants with high (vs low) positive outcome expectations (T 2 -T 3 : B=- 0. 12, SE 0. 05, P=. 02) and participants with anxiety disorder (vs mood disorder) (T 2 -T 3 : B=- 0. 43, SE 0. 21, P=. 04). Simple slope analyses revealed that despite some subgroups benefiting less from the intervention than others, all subgroups still benefited significantly.

40|$|Introduction: An {{important}} {{concern in}} <b>Internet-based</b> <b>treatments</b> (IBTs) for emotional disorders {{is the high}} dropout rate from these protocols. Although dropout rates are usually reported in research studies, very few studies qualitatively explore the experiences of patients who drop out of IBTs.

Method: A Consensual Qualitative Research study was applied in 10 intentionally-selected patients who dropped out of a transdiagnostic IBT. Results: 22 categories were identified within 6 domains. Among the clients an undeniable pattern arose regarding the insufficient support due to the absence of a therapist and the lack of specificity of the contents to their own problems. Conclusions: The analyzed content has direct impact on the clinical application of IBTs. A more tailored manage of expectations as well as strategies to enhance the therapeutic relationship in certain clients are identified as the two key elements in order to improve the dropout in IBTs. Going further, in the mid and long run, ideographic interventions would be vital.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Social anxiety {{disorder}} (SAD) {{is one of}} the most common mental disorders and causes subjective suffering and economic burden worldwide. Although effective treatments are available, a lot of cases go untreated. Internet-based self-help is a low-threshold and flexible treatment alternative for SAD. Various studies have already shown that internet-based self-help can be effective to reduce social phobic symptoms significantly. Most of the interventions tested include therapist support, whereas the role of peer support within internet-based self-help has not yet been fully understood. There is evidence suggesting that patients' mutual exchange via integrated discussion forums can increase the efficacy of <b>internet-based</b> <b>treatments.</b> This study aims at investigating the added value of therapist-guided group support on the <b>treatment</b> outcome of <b>internet-based</b> self-help for SAD. METHODS/DESIGN: The study is conducted as a randomized controlled trial. A total of 150 adults with a diagnosis of SAD are randomly assigned to either a waiting-list control group or one of the active conditions. The participants in the two active conditions use the same internet-based self-help program, either with individual support by a psychologist or therapist-guided group support. In the group guided condition, participants can communicate with each other via an integrated, protected discussion forum. Subjects are recruited via topic related websites and links; diagnostic status will be assessed with a telephone interview. The primary outcome variables are symptoms of SAD and diagnostic status after the intervention. Secondary endpoints are general symptomology, depression, quality of life, as well as the primary outcome variables 6 months later. Furthermore, process variables such as group processes, the change in symptoms and working alliance will be studied. DISCUSSION: The results of this study should indicate whether group-guided support could enhance the efficacy of an <b>internet-based</b> self-help <b>treatment</b> for SAD. This novel treatment format, if shown effective, could represent a cost-effective option and could further be modified to treat other conditions, as well...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Smartphone {{technology}} has recently gained atten-tion {{in the field}} of E-Mental Health research and mobile appli-cations for measuring health-related aspects as well as mobile mental health interventions have emerged. However, little work has been done on leveraging mobile technology in combination with internet-based interventions. We argue, that mobile applica-tions can not only enrich mental health treatments but also foster the commercial success of E-Mental Health applications. To this end, we have developed GET. ON PAPP, a mobile application for panic disorder that integrates an <b>internet-based</b> <b>treatment</b> into daily life. In this work, we present the development and structure of GET. ON PAPP and a perspective for its evaluation. I...|$|E
40|$|Background. Subthreshold {{depression}} {{is a highly}} prevalent condition and {{a risk factor for}} developing a major depressive episode. Internet-based cognitive behaviour therapy may be a promising approach for the treatment of subthreshold depression. The current study had two aims: (1) to determine whether an internet-based cognitive behaviour therapy intervention and a group cognitive behaviour therapy intervention are more effective than a waiting-list control group; and (2) to determine whether the effect of the internet-based cognitive behaviour therapy differs from the group cognitive behaviour therapy intervention. Method. A total of 191 women and 110 men with subthreshold depression were randomized into <b>internet-based</b> <b>treatment,</b> group cognitive behaviour therapy (Lewinsohn's Coping With Depression course), or a waiting-list control condition. The main outcome measure was treatment response after 10 weeks, defined as the difference in pre- and post-treatment scores on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Missing data, a major limitation of this study, were imputed using the Multiple Imputation (MI) procedure Data Augmentation. Results. In the waiting-list control group, we found a pre- to post-improvement effect size of 0. 45, which was 0. 65 in the group cognitive behaviour therapy condition and 1. 00 within the <b>internet-based</b> <b>treatment</b> condition. Helmert contrasts showed {{a significant difference between the}} waiting-list condition and the two treatment conditions (p= 0. 04) and no significant difference between both treatment conditions (p= 0. 62). Conclusions. An internet-based intervention may be at least as effective as a commonly used group cognitive behaviour therapy intervention for subthreshold depression in people over 50 years of age. © 2007 Cambridge University Press...|$|E
40|$|Major {{depression}} can {{be treated}} by means of cognitive behavior therapy, delivered via the Internet as guided self-help. Individually tailored guided self-help treatments have shown promising results {{in the treatment of}} anxiety disorders. This randomized controlled trial tested the efficacy of an Internet-based individually tailored guided self-help treatment which specifically targeted depression with comorbid symptoms. The treatment was compared both to standardized (non-tailored) <b>Internet-based</b> <b>treatment</b> and to an active control group {{in the form of a}} monitored online discussion group. Both guided self-help treatments were based on cognitive behavior therapy and lasted for 10 weeks. The discussion group consisted of weekly discussion themes related to depression and the treatment of depression. A total of 121 participants with diagnosed major depressive disorder and with a range of comorbid symptoms were randomized to three groups. The tailored treatment consisted of a prescribed set of modules targeting depression as well as comorbid problems. The standardized treatment was a previously tested guided self-help program for depression. From pre-treatment to post-treatment, both treatment groups improved on measures of depression, anxiety and quality of life. The results were maintained at a 6 -month follow-up. Subgroup analyses showed that the tailored treatment was more effective than the standardized treatment among participants with higher levels of depression at baseline and more comorbidity, both in terms of reduction of depressive symptoms and on recovery rates. In the subgroup with lower baseline scores of depression, few differences were seen between treatments and the discussion group. This study shows that tailored <b>Internet-based</b> <b>treatment</b> for depression is effective and that addressing comorbidity by tailoring may be one way of making guided self-help treatments more effective than standardized approaches in the treatment of more severe depression.

40|$|Abstract Background Depression is {{a highly}} {{prevalent}} condition, affecting more than 15 % {{of the adult population}} at least once in their lives. Guided self-help is effective in the treatment of depression. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the effectiveness of two <b>Internet-based</b> guided self-help <b>treatments</b> with adults reporting elevated depressive symptoms. Other research questions concern the identification of potential mediators and the search for subgroups who respond differently to the interventions. Methods This study is a randomized controlled trial with three conditions: two treatment conditions and one waiting list control group. The two <b>treatment</b> conditions are <b>Internet-based</b> cognitive behavior therapy and Internet-based problem-solving therapy. They consist of 8 and 5 weekly lessons respectively. Both interventions are combined with support by e-mail. Participants in the waiting list control group receive the intervention three months later. The study population consists of adults from the general population. They are recruited through advertisements in local and national newspapers and through banners on the Internet. Subjects with symptoms of depression (≥ 16 on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale) are included. Other inclusion criteria are having sufficient knowledge of the Dutch language, access to the Internet and an e-mail address. Primary outcome is depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes are anxiety, quality of life, dysfunctional cognitions, worrying, problem solving skills, mastery, absence at work and use of healthcare. We will examine the following variables as potential mediators: dysfunctional cognitions, problem solving skills, worrying, anxiety and mastery. Potential moderating variables are: socio-demographic characteristics and symptom severity. Data are collected at baseline and at 5 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks and 9 months after baseline. Analyses will be conducted on the intention-to-treat sample. Discussion This study evaluates two <b>Internet-based</b> <b>treatments</b> for depression, namely cognitive behavioral therapy and problem-solving therapy. The effectiveness of Internet-based problem-solving therapy suggest that this may be a worthwhile alternative to other more intensive treatment options. Strengths and limitations of this study are discussed. Trial registration Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN 16823487 </p...|$|R

40|$|Information {{technology}} is increasingly used in healthcare. New methods, such as apps and computer programs and <b>Internet-based</b> <b>treatments</b> {{are introduced to}} treat various medical diagnoses. Increased demand for help in mental illness means {{that it is necessary}} to develop alternative assessment and treatments to traditional treatments that may be offered by primary care and specialist psychiatry. Government and Local Authorities and Regions (SKL) have agreed to support, and treatment on the web is part of that development. The work is all about, and how Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (Bup), use psychological e- services, and apps for the treatment of adolescents and the types of psychological e-treatments for adolescents are available in Sweden today.   Methods used are interviews and literature studies, where I examined the use of computerized psychological treatments in Västernorrland and Stockholm County Council. What is there to provide young people with mental health problems for various forms of internet treatments? There are a number of psychological e- treatments on the market in Sweden, which has proven beneficial effect. Most of them are not used specifically for young people. Research on psychological e- treatments for children and adolescents is still in its infancy, but the potential benefits have already been seen. This has also thrown light upon the advantages and disadvantages of psychological e- treatment in general. There are a lot of interesting research on the subject Internet psychiatric treatment and several ongoing projects conducted around the Swedish county councils, so in the future there will hopefully be more psychological internet treatment to offer adolescents...|$|R
