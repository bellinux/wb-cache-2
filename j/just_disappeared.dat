2500|$|On January 9, 1996, Raduyev, {{allegedly}} copying Shamil Basayev's 1995 Budyonnovsk attack, led {{a large-scale}} Kizlyar hostage taking raid into neighbouring Russian region of Dagestan, where his men took hostage at least 2,000 civilians. The raid, which made Raduyev world-famous, escalated into the all-out battle {{and ended with}} the complete destruction of the border village of Pervomayskoye, and other Chechen leaders criticised Raduyev. In March 1996, {{he was shot in}} the head and incorrectly reported dead; Russian special forces claimed to have [...] "killed" [...] him in revenge for the Kizlyar attack, while the other sources said he was shot in a Chechen feud. On March 7, 63 out of 101 deputies of the Parliament of Estonia sent condolences to Dudayev expressing [...] "deep sympathy with the Chechen people" [...] on [...] "the loss of commander Raduyev," [...] sparking a row with the Russian Duma.

2500|$|While Ossie and Alice {{were great}} at {{creating}} an image and drawing {{in the rich}} and famous, they were less successful at managing a business. Many garments were given away to celebrities or <b>just</b> <b>disappeared</b> from the shop. By 1967, Quorum, the partnership between Alice Pollock and Ossie, was deeply in debt and Alice's financial backer, Mike Armitage, a stockbroker, decided there was little possibility of Quorum ever making a profit and he and Alice agreed to sell Quorum to a large UK fashion house, Radley (run by Alfred Radley). Radley took over Quorum's debts and put the management onto a sound basis. Alfred Radley was keen to maintain what made Ossie special and so he continued to support Ossie's aspirations by developing the Ossie Clark brand and funding large annual fashion shows, expanding Quorum's retail business and distributing Ossie's dresses to leading retailers around {{the world through the}} introduction of the [...] "Ossie Clark for Radley" [...] collections.|$|E
2500|$|After Nero's {{death in}} 68 AD, Rome saw a {{succession}} of short-lived emperors (Galba, Otho and Vitellius) and a year of civil wars until Vespasian eventually took control in 69 AD. The Roman Empire destabilized so greatly that Tacitus reported: [...] "Many believed {{the end of the}} empire was at hand" [...] (Histories 4:5:4) According to Suetonius, to the surprise of the world, [...] "the empire which for a long time had been unsettled and, as it were, drifting through the usurpation and violent death of three emperors, was at last taken in and given stability by the Flavian family" [...] (Vespasian 1: 1). This may be a reference to the mortal wound on one of the heads of the beast [...] "inflicted by the sword" [...] which was later healed (Rev. 13:3, Rev. 13: 14). Scholar Daniel K. Wong wrote that the [...] "healing of the wound" [...] alludes to the so-called Nero Redivivus legend or the [...] "revival of Nero" [...] myth.

2500|$|On January 26, 2011 (Australia Day), Buffett was {{performing}} {{a concert in}} Australia at Sydney's Hordern Pavilion and fell off the stage after an encore. A concert-goer said, [...] "He just {{went over to the}} edge of the stage, like he had numerous times through the night, just to wave, and people were throwing stuffed toys and things at him. And he just took one step too many and <b>just</b> <b>disappeared</b> in a flash. He didn't have time to put his arms out to save himself or anything, he just dropped." [...] Coincidentally, one of Australia's leading trauma surgeons was at the concert and close to the stage; Dr. Gordian Fulde treated Buffett at the scene. Fulde said, [...] "I thought he'd broken his neck.... I heard the clunk of his head on a metal ledge, he has a deep gash on his scalp, which is all right now.... But at first I thought: this guy is going to be a spinal injury." [...] Dr Fulde turned him on his side so he could breathe and administered first aid. Buffett regained consciousness within a few minutes. He was then transported to St Vincent's Hospital Emergency centre for treatment and was released the next day. Buffett returned to Australia in 2012 for two shows in Brisbane and Melbourne, and made much fun of the incident during those shows. In the Melbourne show in the historic Palais Theatre in the Melbourne beachside suburb of St. Kilda he presented additional verses of [...] "Margaritaville" [...] in which he made humorous references to the accident, much to the audience's delight.|$|E
