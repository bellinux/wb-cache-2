40|$|Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL) is an {{uncommon}} chronic B cell Lymphoproliferative disorder {{characterized by the}} accumulation of a small mature B cell lymphoid cells with abundant cytoplasm and “hairy” projections within the peripheral blood smear, bone marrow and splenic red pulp. Most patients with HCL present with symptons related to splenomegaly or cytopenias, including some constitucional symptons, however one quarter of them is asymptomatic and is referred due to incidental findings. The authors decided to report a clinical case of <b>hairy</b> <b>cells</b> <b>leukemia</b> in an asymptomatic patient due to the rarity of this neoplasia (2 % of all leukemias and less than 1 % of limphoids neoplasms) and because it corresponds to the most successfully treatable leukemia...|$|E

40|$|<b>Hairy</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukemia</b> {{is a rare}} chronic {{lymphoproliferative}} disorder with indolent but progressive clinical course. Patients require treatment when they have significant cytopenia or recurrent infections. The gold standard treatment are purine nucleoside analogues (cladribine and pentostatine), with these agents the rate of complete remission can approach even 95 %. The differential diagnosis between classical <b>hairy</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukemia</b> and other, rare splenic lymphomas that can mimic this disease might be really challenging. Splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes and other new, provisional WHO entities share some, but not all immunophenotypical features with <b>hairy</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukemia.</b> The correct diagnosis is of an extreme importance as these entities require different treatment. Thus further investigation in the pathogenesis of <b>hairy</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukemia</b> is {{required in order to}} solve this challenge. Discovery of the BRAF V 600 E mutation as a disease-defining genetic event in <b>hairy</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukemia</b> can be helpful in both differential diagnosis and treatment of this disease.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the possible direct effects of alpha-interferon (IFN-alpha) in <b>hairy</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukemia,</b> IFN-alpha receptor expression by <b>hairy</b> <b>cells</b> (11 cases) {{was measured by}} a radiolabeling technique and {{compared with that of}} MOLT- 4, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (15 cases), and various other leukemic and normal cell types.

Thirty-three of 34 samples from other hematologic malignancies were negative for BRAF mutations. A BRAF K 601 E mutation was detected in a patient with splenic marginal zone lymphoma. Our data support the recent finding of a disease defining point mutation in <b>hairy</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukemia.</b> Furthermore, high resolution melting with confirmatory Sanger sequencing are useful methods that can be employed in routine diagnostic laboratories to detect BRAF mutations in patients with <b>hairy</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukemia</b> and related lymphoproliferative disorders...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Distinction between mature B-cell {{neoplasms}} can {{be difficult}} due to overlapping of immunologic features and clinical manifestations. This study investigated whether quantifying mean fluorescence intensity of four monoclonal antibodies in a flow cytometry panel is useful for the differential diagnosis and characterization of these disorders. Methods The expressions of CD 52, CD 200, CD 123 and CD 43 were analyzed in samples from 124 patients with mature B-cell neoplasms. The quantitative estimation of these antigens was assessed by mean fluorescence intensity. Results The cases included were 78 chronic lymphocytic leukemias, three atypical chronic lymphocytic leukemias, six marginal zone lymphomas, 11 splenic marginal zone lymphomas, nine lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas, six mantle <b>cell</b> lymphomas, two <b>hairy</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukemias,</b> two <b>hairy</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukemias</b> variant, five follicular lymphomas, one Burkitt lymphoma and one diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The mean fluorescence intensity of CD 200 was higher in atypical chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic <b>leukemia</b> and <b>hairy</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukemia</b> cases. CD 123 showed higher mean fluorescence intensities in <b>hairy</b> <b>cell</b> <b>leukemia</b> <b>cells.</b> Chronic lymphocytic <b>leukemia,</b> atypical chronic lymphocytic <b>leukemia</b> and mantle <b>cell</b> lymphoma had higher expression of CD 43 and all follicular lymphoma cases had very low mean fluorescence intensity values.
