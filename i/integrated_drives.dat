40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: Machines dynamic {{performance}} depends not only upon the mechanical structure and components {{but also the}} drives and control system. However, {{the design of the}} machines is still at the nascent stage by working on an individual machine basis, hence lacks generic scientific approach and design guideline. Approach: Using computer models <b>integrated</b> <b>drives</b> and control system to predict the {{dynamic performance}} of ultra-precision machine tools can help manufacturers substantially reduce the lead time and cost of developing new machine. This study proposed a holistic integrated dynamic design and modeling approach, which supports analysis and optimization of the overall machine dynamic performance at the early design stage. The modeling and simulation process on an ultra-precision lathe machine tool is presented using the proposed approach. Results: Model of an ultra precision machine tool is established and used to predict the overall machine performance of the configuration. Deformations of base and fixed sideways in motion are calculated to demonstrate the valid of the method. Conclusion: Excellent accuracy on motion deformation is achieved. The designed and implemented integrated time-domain dynamic analysis and modeling system can predict the static and dynamic performance of ultra-precision machine tools, which can reduce the lead time and the cost of developing new machine...|$|E
40|$|At the Fraunhofer IPA, {{the limits}} of what is {{currently}} possible using rapid processes are being examined and increasingly approved for practical applications. Rapid technologies are generative manufacturing methods already familiar {{in the area of}} "Rapid Prototyping" in which CAD data is used to develop items directly layer-by-layer without necessitating any of the diversions represented by tools or semi-finished products. Tool-free construction also means the ability to build without any geometric restrictions. Thanks to developments by machine manufacturers both in terms of processes and material development, a wide variety of materials is available today for manufacturing using rapid technologies. From various plastics, through elastic materials to high-quality titanium alloys for medical applications: this new design freedom is examined in the area of "Design for Rapid Manufacturing" at the Fraunhofer IP and incorporated in the development processes of industrial partners' consulting projects and in the ideas of the product designers they employ. In the form of a demonstration of what is technically possible, the IPA presented {{for the first time a}} fully-functional robot grip at its annual in-house "User Forum Rapid Product Development" event in autumn 2005. Built from a piece of polyamide using rapid manufacturing processes, it could be put into operation without requiring any additional assembly. As a new demonstration item for the Automatica 2006, a robot arm study was developed in which various gripping possibilities were realised using five <b>integrated</b> <b>drives.</b> This robot arm study was also developed in a single manufacturing process directly from CAD and is extremely lightweight as well as being fully functional...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{deaerator}} is {{a mechanical}} device {{that is used}} to separate air from oil. The deaerator is a component of the <b>Integrated</b> <b>Drive</b> Generator (IDG). The <b>Integrated</b> <b>Drive</b> Generator is used in aircrafts as the main power generator. Oil is used in the IDG as a lubricant and coolant. Air is trapped in the oil due to high suction forces of the oil pumps. The entrained air adversely affects the lubricative and thermal properties of oil. Centrifugal forces inside the deaerator are used to remove this entrained air from the oil. Hamilton Sundstrand has several different deaerator models, but has been unable to evaluate the efficiency of oil separation for different designs. Our goal is to evaluate the efficiency of two deaerator models. The evaluation will be based on experimental and theoretical data. The experimental data will be collected using an actual deaerator setup. The theoretical data will be collected using computational fluid dynamic (CFD) software models. ANSYS CFX software will be used for CFD models. The experimental results will then be compared to the theoretical results.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Electrical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. The McTronX {{research}} {{group at the}} North-West University is currently researching self-sensing techniques for Active Magnetic Bearings (AMB). The {{research is part of}} an ongoing effort to expand the knowledge base on AMBs in the School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering to support industries that make use of the technology. The aim of this project is to develop an integrated co-processor based power electronic drive with the emphasis placed on the ability of the co-processor to execute AMB self-sensing algorithms. The two primary techniques for implementing self-sensing in AMBs are state estimation and modulation. This research focuses on hardware development to facilitate the implementation of the modulation method. Self-sensing algorithms require concurrent processing power and speed that are well suited to an architecture that combines a digital signal processor (DSP) and a field programmable gate array (FPGA). A comprehensive review of various power amplifier topologies shows that the pulse width modulation (PWM) switching amplifier is best suited for controlling the voltage and current required to drive the AMB coils. Combining DSPs and power electronics to form an integrated co-processor based power electronic drive requires detail attention to aspects of PCB design, including signal integrity and grounding. A conceptual design is conducted and forms {{part of the process of}} compiling a subsystem development specification for the <b>integrated</b> <b>drive,</b> in conjunction with the McTronX Research Group. Component selection criteria, trade-off studies and various circuit simulations serve as the basis for this essential phase of the project. The conceptual design and development specification determines the architecture, functionality and interfaces of the <b>integrated</b> <b>drive.</b> Conceptual designs for the power amplifier, digital controller, electronic supply and mechanical layout of the <b>integrated</b> <b>drive</b> is provided. A detail design is performed for the power amplifier, digital controller and electronic supply. Issues such as component selection, power supply requirements, thermal design, interfacing of the various circuit elements and PCB design are covered in detail. The output of the detail design is a complete set of circuit diagrams for the integrated controller. The <b>integrated</b> <b>drive</b> is interfaced with existing AMB hardware and facilitates the successful implementation of two self-sensing techniques. The hardware performance of the integrated coprocessor based power electronic drive is evaluated by means of measurements taken from this experimental self-sensing setup. The co-processor performance is evaluated in terms of resource usage and execution time and performs satisfactorily in this regard. The integrated co-processor based power electronic drive provided sufficient resources, processing speed and flexibility to accommodate a variety of self-sensing algorithms thus contributing to the research currently underway in the field of AMBs by the McTronX {{research group}} at the North-West University.

Deaerator is a component of <b>integrated</b> <b>drive</b> generator (IDG), which is used to separate air from oil. <b>Integrated</b> <b>drive</b> generator is the main power generation unit used in aircrafts to generate electric-power and must be cooled to give maximum efficiency. Mob Jet Oil II is used in these IDGs as a lubricant and coolant. So, in order to get high-quality oil, a deaerator is used to remove trapped air from this Mob Jet Oil II using the centrifugal principle. The reason for entrapment of air may be due to operation of vacuum and high-pressure pumps. In this study, 75 / 90 IDG generic and A 320 classic deaerator performance evaluation was done based on both experimental and numerical techniques. Experimental data was collected from deaerator test rig and numerical data was attained using CFD simulations (software used for CFD simulation is ANSYS CFX). Both experimental and numerical results were compared and also deaerator 75 / 90 generic and A 320 classic was compared in this study.
