5|$|Coal {{balls in}} North America were first found in Iowa coal seams in 1894, {{although}} {{the connection to}} European coal balls was not made until Adolf Carl Noé (whose coal ball was found by Gilbert Cady) drew the parallel in 1922. Noé's work renewed interest in coal balls, and by the 1930s had drawn paleobotanists <b>from</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>to</b> the Illinois Basin in search of them.|$|E
5|$|On 29 November 2007, it was {{announced}} that the 16th Sustainment Brigade would be deployed to Iraq in summer of 2008. It would be part of a force of 8,000 soldiers from US Army Europe to deploy. The brigade was just one of over 20 major units <b>from</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>to</b> deploy to the Middle East in 2008; most of these units came from the 21st Theater Sustainment Command and V Corps. Throughout the Spring of 2008, the unit prepared for the deployment by conducting training exercises in Germany.|$|E

5|$|The Action of 22 January 1809 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} {{fought off}} the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe during the Napoleonic Wars. The action was fought {{as part of the}} blockade of Guadeloupe and neighbouring Martinique by a large British Royal Navy squadron, which was seeking to cut the islands off from contact and supplies from France by preventing the passage of shipping <b>from</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>to</b> the islands. The British blockade was part of their preparation for planned invasions during the next year.|$|E

5|$|Cheetah fossils {{found in}} the lower beds of the Olduvai Gorge site in {{northern}} Tanzania {{date back to the}} Pleistocene. The extinct species of Acinonyx are older than the cheetah, with the oldest known from the late Pliocene; these fossils are about three million years old. These species include Acinonyx pardinensis (Pliocene epoch), notably larger than the modern cheetah, and A.intermedius (mid-Pleistocene period). While the range of A.intermedius stretched <b>from</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>to</b> China, Apardinensis spanned over Eurasia as well as eastern and southern Africa. A variety of larger cheetah believed to have existed in Europe fell to extinction around half a million years ago.|$|E
5|$|During mid-July the USAAF {{strategic}} bomber {{forces in the}} Pacific were reorganized. On 16July, XXIBomber Command was re-designated the Twentieth Air Force and LeMay appointed its commander. Two days later the United States Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific (USASTAF) was established at Guam {{under the command of}} General Carl Spaatz. USASTAF's role was to command the Twentieth Air Force as well as the Eighth Air Force, which at the time was moving <b>from</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>to</b> Okinawa. The Eighth Air Force was led by James Doolittle (who had been promoted to general) and was being reequipped with B-29s. The Commonwealth Tiger Force, which was to include Australian, British, Canadian and New Zealand heavy bomber squadrons and attack Japan from Okinawa, was also to come under the command of USASTAF when it arrived in the region during late 1945.|$|E

5|$|In 1521, Portuguese {{explorer}} Ferdinand Magellan {{became the}} first person <b>from</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>to</b> reach Asia by sailing west, a voyage of which he would meet an untimely death in the island of the Philippines. Spain sent expeditions to colonize the East Indies in their competition with Portugal to seize control over the spice trade. However, all of these expeditions failed. It was not until Miguel López de Legazpi, sailing from Mexico with five ships and five hundred men, reached the Philippines in 1565 and a Spanish settlement was established. López de Legazpi was greeted by hostile Muslim tribes opposing a foreign invasion. His attempt {{to land on the}} island of Cebu resulted in the death of one of his soldiers prompting him to explore another island and seek trade with various tribes.|$|E
5|$|In 1803, Egan {{became one}} of the pastors of St. Mary's Church at Philadelphia. The move coincided with a yellow fever {{outbreak}} in Philadelphia. Though less virulent than Philadelphia's famous 1793 outbreak of the disease, there were nonetheless many deaths, and Egan presided over many funerals that year—St. Mary's had 77 interments between June and November 1803. In 1804, Egan received permission to establish a province of Franciscans in the United States for the first time, independent of the Irish Franciscans who were then supervising the American mission. Two years later, a parishioner willed Egan some land along the Yellow Creek in Indiana County, {{for the establishment of a}} Franciscan church. Due to the order's vows of poverty, Egan asked Carroll to hold the land in his name. Egan's dream was never realized, as he was unable to attract Franciscans <b>from</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>to</b> establish the planned church.|$|E
5|$|On 4 February 1941, Müncheberg was {{informed}} by Gruppenkommandeur Schöpfel that the 7. Staffel had {{to relocate to}} Sicily in support of X. Fliegerkorps, {{under the command of}} General der Flieger (General of the Flyers) Hans Geisler, for actions against the strategically important island of Malta. With the opening of a new front in North Africa in mid-1940, British air and sea forces based on the island could attack Axis ships transporting vital supplies and reinforcements <b>from</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>to</b> North Africa. To counter this threat the Luftwaffe and the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Royal Air Force) were tasked with bombing raids in an effort to neutralise the RAF defences and the ports.|$|E

5|$|Siboney {{then began}} her peacetime mission of {{returning}} American veterans <b>from</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>to</b> the United States. After embarking 513 wounded men at Saint-Nazaire, {{she moved to}} Brest on the 15th and took on 600 more passengers. She sailed the same day under escort and reached New York on 24November. During the next ten months, Siboney made ten more round trips between the United States and France, returning over 3,000troops per trip when fully loaded. On one such return trip in August 1919, Siboney carried Admiral Henry T. Mayo and Congressman Thomas S. Butler home from France.|$|E
5|$|The Invasion of the Cape Colony was a British {{military}} expedition {{launched in}} 1795 against the Dutch Cape Colony at the Cape of Good Hope, {{the southern tip}} of Southern Africa. The Dutch colony at the Cape, established in the seventeenth century, was at the time the only viable South African port for ships making the journey <b>from</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>to</b> the European colonies in the East Indies. It therefore held vital strategic importance, although it was otherwise economically insignificant. In the winter of 1794, during the French Revolutionary Wars, French troops entered the Dutch Republic, which was reformed into the Batavian Republic. In response, Great Britain launched operations against the Dutch Empire to use its facilities against the French Navy.|$|E

5|$|The bee-eaters have an Old World distribution, {{occurring}} <b>from</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>to</b> Australia. The {{centre of}} {{diversity of the}} family is Africa, although a number of species also occur in Asia. Single species occur in each of Europe, (the European bee-eater), Australia (the rainbow bee-eater) and Madagascar (the olive bee-eater, also found on mainland Africa). Of the three genera, Merops, which has {{the majority of the}} species, occurs across the entirety of the family's distribution. Nyctyornis is restricted to Asia, ranging from India and southern China to the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Borneo. The genus Meropogon has a single species restricted to Sulawesi in Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|The {{search by}} Europeans for a western {{shortcut}} by sea <b>from</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>to</b> Asia {{began with the}} voyages of Christopher Columbus in 1492 and continued through the mid-19th century with {{a long series of}} exploratory expeditions originating mainly in England. These voyages, when to any degree successful, added to the sum of European geographic knowledge about the Western Hemisphere, particularly North America, and as that knowledge grew larger, attention gradually turned toward the Arctic. Voyagers of the 16th and 17th centuries who made geographic discoveries about North America included Martin Frobisher, John Davis, Henry Hudson, and William Baffin. In 1670, the incorporation of the Hudson's Bay Company led to further exploration of the Canadian coasts and interior and of the Arctic seas. In the 18th century, explorers included James Knight, Christopher Middleton, Samuel Hearne, James Cook, Alexander MacKenzie, and George Vancouver. By 1800, their discoveries showed conclusively that no Northwest Passage navigable by ships lay in the temperate latitudes between the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans.|$|E
5|$|A factory was {{established}} {{soon after the}} fort was constructed and it minted coins that bore the initials TB or DB, indicating Dansborg. The fort acted as the important gateway in the trade route <b>from</b> <b>Europe</b> <b>to</b> Coramandel. Protestant missionaries were sent from Denmark by king Fredric IV, who was also the head of Lutheran Church of Denmark. Two of them, namely, Bartholomäus Ziegenbalg and Heinrich Plutschua came to Tranquebar on 9 July 1706, established the Tranquebar Mission, learnt Tamil {{in a few years}} and were the first to translate and print The New Testament of the Bible in Tamil in the printing press inside the fort. The Danish mission was the first Protestant mission in India and from its inception, was staffed by German missionaries trained at Pietist schools and seminary founded by Francke at the end of 17th century. A Tamil-Latin dictionary containing 9000 words was compiled there by a medical missionary named Friedrich Koenig in 1778, whose source letters are stored in the royal archives. The fort is featured in a large number of videos, films and commercials. After India's independence in 1947, the fort was used as an inspection bungalow by the state government till 1978 when the State Department of Archaeology of the Government of Tamil Nadu took over the control of the fort. The fort is now used as a museum, housing a collection of major artifacts of the fort and the Danish empire. The fort {{is one of the most}} visited tourist landmarks in the region.|$|E
