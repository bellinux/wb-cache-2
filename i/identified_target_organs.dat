The no observed adverse effect level was determined to be> 5 but < 25 mg/kg/d and the maximum tolerated dose 100 mg/kg/d. The highest dose, 200 mg/kg/d, resulted in significant toxicity and mortality, leading to euthanization of the main study animals in this group after 7 days. Oxfendazole did not exhibit genetic toxicology signals in standard Ames bacterial, mouse lymphoma, or rat micro-nucleus assays nor did it provoke safety concerns when evaluated for behavioral effects in rats or cardiovascular safety effects in dogs. These results support the transition of oxfendazole to First in Human safety studies preliminary to its evaluation in human helminth diseases...|$|E
30|$|Generally, the {{observed}} effects of metformin in brown trout concerning body weight, liver glycogen and the intestinal microbiome {{did not follow}} a linear concentration-effect relationship. However, a profound mechanistic explanation for this finding cannot be provided since the pharmaceutical action of the drug is still not fully elucidated. Scheen [60] and Graham et al. [27] indicated that metformin shows nonlinear pharmacokinetics caused by a reduced bioavailability at higher doses. Moreover, Chung et al. [11] revealed that effects on glycaemia did not linearly increase with higher doses of metformin in humans. The results of these studies led to the assumption that a similar phenomenon could have been possible in our study. Thus, metformin did not show an effect at the highest concentration. However, it would be favourable to complement our results of liver glycogen increase, the intestinal microbiome shift and body weight reduction {{and focus on the}} uptake of metformin at different concentrations in the <b>identified</b> <b>target</b> <b>organs</b> of the liver, intestine and brain to validate the assumptions for the nonlinearity of the obtained results.|$|E

40|$|The {{currently}} available methods of assessing ocular toxicity are discussed. Manifestations of ocular toxicity are best described clinically; histopathological {{examination of the}} eye is beset with problems of preparing the eye for morphological examination. Electron microscopy is essential to look for chemically induced side effects at the cellular level. Mechanisms of ocular toxicity are poorly understood, and the limitation of animal studies in predicting side effects in man must be appreciated. The concept of chemical damage to the eye, with effects on vision, {{is one of the}} sensitive areas of current toxicology. Because of the problems of adverse reactions it is now required that new chemicals are tested for safety before their general release. Animal studies are essentially comparative, in that spontaneous and induced pathological manifestations are compared in control and treated animals, respectively. The purpose is to identify variations from normal and to define underlying disturbances of physiological mechanisms. The conventional procedure for toxicity studies is to have a control group and three groups of animals given different dose levels of a compound, in order to <b>identify</b> <b>target</b> <b>organ</b> systems and to define no observable effect levels. The regulatory authorities stipulate that these studies must be carried out in a rodent and a nonrodent species. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to outline the methods for assessing ocular damage in the commonly used laboratory species, following systemic administration of chemicals, with particular reference to underlying mechanisms of toxicity, and to draw attention to the limitations both in the use of, and understanding of, these approaches to safety evaluation.

30|$|Ravi River is {{perceived}} {{to be one of the}} most polluted rivers in Pakistan. There are over seven municipal sewage outlets and two drains which discharge their untreated effluents when the river passes through Lahore, the capital of the Punjab province of Pakistan (Saeed and Bahzad 2006; Shakir et al. 2013). Freshwaters such as the Ravi River are highly vulnerable to different sorts of pollutions, since they act as immediate sinks for the outputs of anthropogenic activities. Fishes are one of the richest sources of an essentially healthy diet. Therefore, it is important to know the impacts of water pollution on the health and growth of these animals. Indeed, different changes in aquatic medium can cause several physiological and compositional changes in fish. Industrial and municipal effluents are the main culprits for undesirable changes in the quality of water and its inhabiting fish (Wilson and Taylor 1993; Shakir et al. 2013). Alterations in biochemical composition of muscles in response to exposure to numerous pollutants have been reported by researchers (Bhathar et al. 2004; Yousafzai and Shakoori 2009). Biochemical profiles are commonly used as stress indicators because most biochemical defenses respond to cellular injury through self-regulating signal transduction mechanisms (Safahieh et al. 2010). Investigation of biochemical parameters can be helpful in <b>identifying</b> <b>target</b> <b>organs</b> of toxicity as well as general health status of animals because it has been advocated for presenting early warning of potentially damaging changes in stressed organisms (Jacobson-Kram and Keller 2001).|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Oestrogenic {{contaminants}} are {{widespread in}} the aquatic environment and {{have been shown to}} induce adverse effects in both wildlife (most notably in fish) and humans, raising international concern. Available detecting and testing systems are limited in their capacity to elucidate oestrogen signalling pathways and physiological impacts. Here we developed a transient expression assay to investigate the effects of oestrogenic chemicals in fish early life stages and to <b>identify</b> <b>target</b> <b>organs</b> for oestrogenic effects. To enhance the response sensitivity to oestrogen, we adopted the use of multiple tandem oestrogen responsive elements (EREc 38) in a Tol 2 transposon mediated Gal 4 ff-UAS system. The plasmid constructed (pTol 2 _ERE-TATA-Gal 4 ff), contains three copies of oestrogen response elements (3 ERE) that on exposure to oestrogen induces expression of Gal 4 ff which this in turn binds Gal 4 -responsive Upstream Activated Sequence (UAS) elements, driving the expression of a second reporter gene, EGFP (Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein). Results The response of our construct to oestrogen exposure in zebrafish embryos was examined using a transient expression assay. The two plasmids were injected into 1 – 2 cell staged zebrafish embryos, and the embryos were exposed to various oestrogens including the natural steroid oestrogen 17 ß-oestradiol (E 2), the synthetic oestrogen 17 α- ethinyloestradiol (EE 2), and the relatively weak environmental oestrogen nonylphenol (NP), and GFP expression was examined in the subsequent embryos using fluorescent microscopy. There was no GFP expression detected in unexposed embryos, but specific and mosaic expression of GFP was detected in the liver, heart, somite muscle and some other tissue cells for exposures to steroid oestrogen treatments (EE 2; 10 [*]ng/L, E 2; 100 [*]ng/L, after 72 [*]h exposures). For the NP exposures, GFP expression was observed at 10 [*]μg NP/L after 72 [*]h (100 [*]μg NP/L was toxic to the fish). We also demonstrate that our construct works in medaka, another model fish test species, suggesting the transient assay is applicable for testing oestrogenic chemicals in fish generally. Conclusion Our results indicate that the transient expression assay system {{can be used as a}} rapid integrated testing system for environmental oestrogens and to detect the oestrogenic target sites in developing fish embryos. </p...|$|R

To <b>identify</b> possible <b>target</b> <b>organs,</b> we used in situ hybridization to study the distribution of androgen receptor (AR) RNA in the developing zebra finch brain. The first brain expression domain of AR mRNA is in the hindbrain. From embryonic day 7 (E 7) onward, when the hypoglossal motor nucleus (nXII) has just formed, there was AR mRNA expression in both its lingual (nXIII) and its tracheosyringeal (nXIIts) parts, {{and this was the}} major site of hindbrain expression at all embryonic stages and in both sexes. From E 8 onward, we also found AR mRNA in the supraspinal motor nucleus (nSSp), which innervates neck muscles. Furthermore, the syrinx, the target of the nXIIts, contained AR mRNA by E 10, localized principally in the perichondria. Muscle was first evident in the syringeal region at E 9, but no AR was detected in syringeal muscles until after hatching. The expression pattern of AR in the zebra finch embryo suggests that maternal androgens act via AR in the brainstem and syrinx to influence hatching as well as acoustic and visual components of food-begging behavior. Maternal androgens seem unlikely to function in the development of sexual dimorphisms in the zebra finch nXIIts and syrinx, insofar as these are not evident until between 10 and 20 days posthatching. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

This acute oral toxicity study was conducted in accordance to OECD 423 guidelines by using male Swiss albino mice weighing 25 - 35 g. First group was served as control group which received distilled water (vehicle) while second and third group were orally treated with single daily dose of 0. 9 g/kg and 1. 8 g/kg of methanol leaves extract of C. nutans, respectively. All the animals were closely observed for 14 days. Body weight for each mouse was recorded at day- 0, day- 3, day- 7 and day- 14. Relative organ weights for liver, kidney, spleen, lung and heart were also determined. All the results were presented as mean ± standard deviation and analyzed using Dunnett’s Test after ANOVA test. From the results obtained, no mortality was observed in both treatment groups either post 24 hours or 14 days of oral administration of C. nutans. Body weight for each mouse and relative organ weight showed insignificant difference when compared to the control group. In conclusion, acute exposure of 1. 8 g/kg of C. nutans was safe in male mice without causing any adverse effects or mortality.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 1015 urban civil servants aged > or = 25 years from seven central government ministries in Accra, Ghana. Participants diagnosed to have hypertension were examined for <b>target</b> <b>organ</b> involvement. Hypertensive <b>target</b> <b>organ</b> damage {{was defined as the}} detection of any of the following: left ventricular hypertrophy diagnosed by electrocardiogram, reduction in glomerular filtration rate, the presence of hypertensive retinopathy or a history of a stroke. RESULTS: Of the 219 hypertensive participants examined, 104 (47. 5 %) had evidence of <b>target</b> <b>organ</b> damage. The presence of <b>target</b> <b>organ</b> damage was associated with higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels. The odds of developing hypertensive <b>target</b> <b>organ</b> damage was five to six times higher in participants with blood pressure (BP) > or = 180 / 110 mmHg compared to those with BP < 140 / 90 mmHg, and there was a trend to higher odds of <b>target</b> <b>organ</b> damage with increasing BP (p = 0. 001).

DNA single-strand breaks (SSB) were measured by the SCG assay 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min after the exposure. Fifteen min after the animals were exposed for 1 min to a 6 -fold dilution of smoke, SSB appeared in the lungs, stomach, and liver; the damage in the lung...|$|R
