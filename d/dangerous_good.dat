40|$|Despite the {{relative}} recent move towards inherent safe materials, the relentless drive of consumerism requires increased quantities of dangerous goods to be manufactured, transported, stored and used year on year. The {{safety and effectiveness}} of road transport systems is {{to be considered a}} strategic goal in particular in those countries, like Italy, in which 80 % of goods are transported by this means. In this paper, we face the risk from <b>dangerous</b> <b>good</b> transport by presenting a site-oriented framework for risk assessment and developing a theoretical approach for emergency planning and optimization. In the first step, we collected field data on a pilot highway and developed a database useful to allow a realistic evaluation of the accident frequency on a given route, by means of multivariate statistical analysis. To this end, we considered both inherent factors (such as tunnels, bend radii, height gradient, slope etc), meteorological factors, and traffic factors (traffic frequency of tank truck, <b>dangerous</b> <b>good</b> truck etc.) suitable to modify the standard national accident frequency. By applying the results to a pilot area, making reference to flammable and explosive scenarios, we performed a risk assessment sensitive to route features and population exposed. The results show that the risk associated to the transport of hazardous materials, in some highway stretches, can be at the boundary of the acceptability level of risk set down by the well known F/N curves established in the Netherlands. On this basis, in the subsequent step, we developed a theoretical approach, based on the graph theory, to plan optimal emergency actions. The effectiveness of an emergency planning can normally be evaluated in term of system quickness and reliability. As a case study, we applied the developed approach to identify optimal consistency and localisation in the pilot area of “prompt action vehicles”, properly equipped, quick to move and ready for every eventuality. Applying this method results in an unambiguous and consistent selection criterion that allows reduction of intervention time, in connection with technical and economic optimisation of emergency equipment...|$|E
30|$|At {{the end of}} an EVB’s first (automotive) life, battery {{redemption}} {{takes place}} (Gohla-Neudecker et al. 2015; Bräuer 2016). European law poses the legal obligation for this take-back on the automotive OEMs, respectively, collaborating car dealers or workshops (e.g., Directive 2000 / 53 /EC 2000; Directive 2006 / 66 /EC 2006). To prevent non-authorized third parties from performing maintenance work on the battery systems or accessing the battery systems’ usage and status data, automotive OEM’s employ proprietary components that demand for OEM-specific equipment and that use encryption on battery-specific data streams and stored battery data (CBR:PE°# 2; SPR:MD°# 1,°# 3, CEI:M 1 °# 1, BRC:BR 2 °# 1) (Ahmadi et al. 2014; Monhof et al. 2015; Neubauer et al. 2015). Moreover, strong legal and regulatory requirements that result from an EVB’s hazard potential and its labeling as a <b>dangerous</b> <b>good</b> set high knowledge and equipment barriers for handling and transporting used EVBs (CRL:CR 1 °# 1, ATI:MD°# 5, BRC:BR 2 °# 1), which especially prevents most EV owners from performing maintenance work or the battery exchange on their own.|$|E
40|$|Since {{dangerous}} goods have special {{physical and chemical}} properties, they can easily produce explosion, fire, poisoning and other accident due to a traffic collision or hazardous leak under a complex transport condition.

40|$|AbstractMost of the {{positioning}} functions in railways today rely on track side sensors that are efficient, but offer mainly discrete positioning, lead to high maintenance costs and differ between countries.

However, no current evaluation methods are able to consider the signal degradations of wireless communications caused by the railway environment.

40|$|Hazardous {{material}} transportation poses obvious hazards to environment, {{general public}} and response personnel. In this context, risk reduction {{can be achieved}} by analyzing and designing correctly the routing of shipments, by proper risk assessment procedure. HazMat transportation risk management must include appropriate emergency response services, limiting accident consequences. This paper presents a quantitative risk assessment approach to HazMat transportation, starting from an historical statistical analysis on road accidents. A methodological approach for the assessment of standard vehicle and <b>dangerous</b> <b>good</b> truck flows was applied to a pilot area in the North of Italy, allowing a statistical reinforced evaluation of route intrinsic enhancing/mitigating parameters. The results evidence the distribution of the risk along the different routes and the localization of high spots, with good accuracy and precision. Preventive and mitigating risk measures are discussed in depth, with particular reference to the optimization of emergency equipment (number of prompt action vehicles) by means of an unambiguous and consistent selection criterion that allows reduction of intervention time. Different risk mitigation options, based on changing route or designing alternative slip roads, in transport corridors or tunnels, are investigated as well. The presented approach can represent a useful tool not only to estimate transport risk, but also to define strategies for the reduction of risk (i. e. distribution and limitation of ADR road traffic, improvement of highway section, design of alternative routes) and emergency management...|$|E
40|$|Objectives of {{this work}} are: the {{assessment}} of a proposed methodology for design of safe transport of dangerous goods through road tunnels in Greece, {{the development of an}} integrated training system for dangerous goods vehicles drivers and their trainers that will include effective response to incidents with involvement of dangerous goods {{and the development of a}} relevant Emergency Response plan. To implement these objectives the methodology used was: (a) Started with extended bibliographic review of dangerous goods road transport design principles and guidelines, review of response systems for road incidents where / when dangerous goods are involved and review of available technologies that support incident management systems. From this review concluded to basic principles and guidelines that are included in the proposed Emergency Response Plan. (b) Modern technologies that contribute to safe operation and successful handling of emergency incidents on road or in tunnels were analyzed. Specifically were analyzed technologies that support drivers of dangerous goods vehicles and help them to exhibit safe behaviors and to prevent accidents. Analyzed available technology included systems that help tracking of vehicle and monitoring of <b>dangerous</b> <b>good</b> conditions as well vehicle drivers’ conditions. (c) The proposed risk assessment methodology was applied on large number of different types of Greek road tunnels; there was research to determine the required field or bibliography data. Results were analyzed in order to prove that this method is applicable to Greek conditions, helping effective and transparent decision making. The proposed methodology will support decisions on the use or not of tunnels for road transport of dangerous goods, will support with quantitative estimates proposals for improving safety conditions of road tunnels and effective measures or actions for successful handling of incidents with dangerous goods on road or in tunnels. (d) Available training systems and courses for dangerous goods drivers in Greece, Europe, US and Canada were reviewed. The main elements of these programs were examined: content, duration, supporting material, praxis, on job testing, assessment, certification aiming to identify best practices, gaps and opportunities. The proposed new training program is closing gaps while using the most effective practices. Results conclusions {{of this work}} are: (ι) The assessed and proposed methodology to estimate and assess risks for transport of <b>dangerous</b> <b>good</b> through road tunnels is applicable in Greece.
