500|$|Burton chose Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania as {{his primary}} filming {{location}} for Metropolis, while start dates for filming were pushed back. A minor {{piece of the}} Krypton set was constructed but then destroyed, and Cage had even attended a costume fitting. The studio was also considering changing the title Superman Lives back to Superman Reborn. Deeming Wesley Strick's script too expensive, Warner Bros. {{enlisted the help of}} Dan Gilroy to rewrite it into something more economically feasible. Gilroy lowered the $190million budget set by Strick's draft to $100million. However, the studio was still less willing to fast track production, due to financial reasons with other film properties, having Gilroy turn in two drafts. Ultimately, Warner Bros. chose to put the film on hold in April 1998, and Burton left to direct Sleepy Hollow. At this point in production, Warner Bros had spent $30million on developing the film. Burton, citing various differences with Peters and the studio, said, [...] "I basically wasted a year.

500|$|After a 20-year {{retirement}} {{from the film}} industry, O'Hara returned to the screen in 1991 to star opposite John Candy in the romantic comedy-drama Only the Lonely. She played Rose Muldoon, the domineering Irish mother of a Chicago cop (Candy), who has an indifference to Sicilians. The film reunited her with Anthony Quinn who plays her brief love interest, Nick the Greek. O'Hara stated of her return: [...] "Twenty years <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> but it was surprising how little changed. The equipment is lighter now, and they work a bit faster, but I hardly felt like I'd been away". She described Candy as [...] "one of my all-time favorite leading men", and {{was surprised by the}} extent of his talent, remarking that he was a [...] "comedic genius but an actor with an extraordinary dramatic talent" [...] who very much reminded her of Charles Laughton. In the following years, she continued to work, starring in several made-for-TV films, including The Christmas Box, Cab for Canada and The Last Dance, the latter her last film in which she played a retired teacher who suffers a heart attack, released on television in 2000.|$|E
500|$|Hideaki Sorachi's {{main focus}} in Gin Tama {{is the use}} of gags; during the manga's second year of {{serialization}} he started to add more drama to the story while still keeping the comedy. Various jokes from the manga are comments regarding clichés from other shōnen series. For example, in the first chapter after Gintoki fights a group of aliens to protect Shinpachi and Tae, Shinpachi complains that he only fought for [...] "one page" [...] and Gintoki replies, [...] "Shut up! One page <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> for a manga artist!" [...] Gintoki's exaggerated desire to read the Weekly Shōnen Jump (which causes him to fight other readers in order to get it) also makes fun of shōnen, since during those parts characters [...] quote them. Other types of comic situations are more general, so that the reader must know about Japanese culture [...] to understand them. The humour is described by publications as being [...] "bizarre" [...] and [...] "weird". It is also described as being divided between two categories: [...] "sci-fi comedy" [...] and a [...] "samurai comedy" [...] with the former referring to the aliens. It [...] tends to point out [...] "an irritating foible about modern society" [...] including celebrations days or famous mythical figures. Additionally, there are references to several historical figures with a few characters from the story being based on them. Besides the series' comedy, the aliens' invasion in Japan bring several social issues between them and the humans with the most recurring one being the lack of social equality. As a result, one of the main themes involves society trying to preserve their own way of living rather than fulfilling a dream like in other shōnen series.|$|E

2500|$|Wilson {{coined the}} term 'Selsdon Man' {{to refer to the}} anti-interventionist {{policies}} of the Conservative leader Edward Heath, developed at a policy retreat held at the Selsdon Park Hotel in early 1970. This phrase, intended to evoke the 'primitive throwback' qualities of anthropological discoveries such as Piltdown Man and Swanscombe Man, was part of a British political tradition of referring to political trends by suffixing 'man'. Other memorable phrases attributed to Wilson include [...] "the white heat of the [...] revolution", and [...] "a week <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> in politics", meaning that political fortunes can change extremely rapidly. In his broadcast after the 1967 devaluation of the pound, Wilson said: [...] "This {{does not mean that the}} pound here in Britain – in your pocket or purse – is worth any less...", and the phrase [...] "the pound in your pocket" [...] subsequently took on a life of its own.|$|E
2500|$|Masterson {{joined the}} D'Oyly Carte Opera Company as a {{principal}} soprano in 1964. After a performance as Mabel in The Pirates of Penzance, The Guardian commented, [...] "It is Valerie Masterson's Mabel that makes one revise ideas on D'Oyly Carte standards. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> since the company had so strong a soprano lead." [...] Other critics agreed: The Times criticised D'Oyly Carte vocal standards in 1968 but called Masterson and Kenneth Sandford [...] "shining exceptions." [...] She remained with D'Oyly Carte for five years, where her major roles were Mabel; Josephine in H.M.S. Pinafore; Phyllis in Iolanthe; Lady Psyche, and subsequently the title role, in Princess Ida; Yum-Yum in The Mikado; Elsie Maynard in The Yeomen of the Guard; and Casilda in The Gondoliers. She appeared as Yum-Yum in the company's 1966 film version of The Mikado. She left the company in 1969 but often returned for guest appearances.|$|E

The film was shown in competition at the 63rd Berlinale in February 2013 where Panahi won the Silver Bear for Best Script.|$|E

2500|$|The show {{received}} favourable reviews. The Observer, though {{noting that}} an Arcadian theme {{was bound to}} provoke comparisons with Gilbert, found that the new piece [...] "stands out among other plays of its class" [...] with [...] "moments to be remembered with joy". The Manchester Guardian, commenting that the piece would be [...] "welcomed by patrons of musical comedy who had had their full dose of the Merry Widow", praised the originality of the writing, and called the score [...] "simple and unpretentious, but melodious and pleasing". The Times said that Monckton and Talbot had surpassed themselves in their music, and that Courtneidge's production [...] "showed ingenuity, care {{and to some extent}} originality, so that familiar elements took on an unfamiliar look and that new things had their full effect." [...] The Daily Express observed, [...] "surely it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time</b> since an audience enjoyed a first night as much as this … [...] has achieved the seemingly impossible. He has produced a 'new' musical comedy which really is new." [...] The paper singled out for praise the songs, [...] "The pipes of Pan", [...] "Light is my heart", [...] "The Girl with a Brogue", [...] "Sweet Simplicitas", and [...] "My motter".|$|E
2500|$|In October 2009, Clarkson {{announced}} that the album would be released in Fall 2010. In January 2011, Clarkson stated that the album would be released in March 2011.

[...] Producer Darkchild told The Hollywood Reporter that it was a [...] "smart decision", while Claude Kelly remarked that the move could work in her favor, citing [...] "I will say that I'd be willing to bet that the reason it was pushed back was not for anything as horrible or earth-shattering as people think — it's probably (sic) a better setup". It was also reported that the delay was caused by the internal restructuring at Sony Music with the former Universal Music Group chairman Doug Morris entering as its new CEO. On July 11, 2011, several demo songs that Clarkson recorded, ranging from 50 to 70, were leaked into the internet, some of which were recorded in 2002 while Clarkson was still recording Thankful, and for Stronger. RCA immediately issued warnings to infringing websites, and leaked tracks were soon removed from such sites. Clarkson, who came home after spending a vacation in Tahiti, released a statement, saying [...] "I get back in the States from a vacation and somehow 50 of my songs are leaked on the Internet?! There's no point in getting angry because there's nothing I can do. I can't wait for everybody to hear my actual finished fifth album."
