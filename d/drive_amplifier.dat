50|$|The {{innermost}} loop {{regulates the}} current in the torque motor. This type of motor creates torque that is nearly {{proportional to the}} rotor current, {{even if it is}} forced to turn backward. Because of the action of the commutator, there are instances when two rotor windings are simultaneously energized. If the motor was driven by a voltage controlled voltage source, the current would roughly double, as would the torque. By sensing the current with a small sensing resister (RS) and feeding that voltage back to the inverting input of the <b>drive</b> <b>amplifier,</b> the amplifier becomes a voltage controlled current source. With constant current, when two windings are energized, they share the current and the variation of torque is on the order of 10%.|$|E

The special case of an equal-amplitude two-tone input signal is considered in detail. The results show that unless the input signal can <b>drive</b> the <b>amplifier</b> into its nonlinear region, no gain expansion or minimum intermodulation performance can be achieved.
