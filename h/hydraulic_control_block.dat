Obtaining {{experimental}} {{data on the}} nature of the percolation transition processes in hydraulic drive on the basis of discrete-regulated axial-piston hydraulic machines; the comparison of {{experimental data}} with the results of numerical calculation. Methodology. The study of transient processes was carried out by means of a using a hydraulic drive on the basis of axial piston hydromachines of 403 series, with volume of 112 cubic centimetres on an experimental stand with a capacity recuperation. Pressure in pressure line and <b>hydraulic</b> motor <b>control</b> line, speed of pump rotation and flow rate through overload relief valve continuously registered. The experimental data were compared with results of numerical calculation. Scope of the results. The obtained results can be used when designing more efficient and reliable hydraulic drives of road-building machines. Conclusions. Comparison of experimental data and results of numerical calculation shows that the proposed by authors a mathematical model of hydraulic drive on the base of discrete-controlled axial piston hydromachines with cylinder?s tilting block, adequately reflects basic physical processes that determine the operation of hydraulic drive. For further improvement of the model it?s necessary to specify the model of <b>hydraulic</b> machine?s <b>control</b> <b>block</b> and consider wave effects in the pipelines of pressure line and hydraulic cylinders of pumping unit. ??????????? ?????????? ???????? ? ?????????????, ?? ?????? ????????? ???????????? ?????????-????????? ?????????? ? ????????? ?????? ?????????, ??????????? ??? ????????? ? ????????? ?????? ?????? ????????????. ???????????? ?????????? ?????????????????? ???????????? ????????? ???????? ? ???????? ????? ? ????? ?????????? ??????? ??????? ????????????. ?????????? ??????????? ???????? ???????? ? ????? ???????????? ??????? ?????????? ????????? ???????? ?????? ? ?????? ????????? ????. ????????? ????????? ????????????????? ?????? ? ???????????? ????????? ???????? ? ?????? ?????????????? ?????? ???????? ????????? ???????? ?????? ?????????-????????? ??????????? ? ????????? ?????? ?????????...|$|R

40|$|Control of Solids Retention Time (SRT) in the {{activated}} sludge process {{is critical for}} ensuring effective wastewater treatment. SRT sets {{the growth rate of}} microorganisms in the {{activated sludge}} process, thereby selecting the microbial composition of the mixed liquor and its settling and treatment properties. The industry has developed various methods to control activated sludge. This study evaluated seven (7) methods to calculate SRT and implemented a simple, straightforward <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> of SRT method. The study was conducted at the 34 mgd Seneca WWTP in Eagan, MN, which operates a plug-flow nitrifying activated sludge process with reduced air-flows in initial zones to enhance phosphorus removal. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> of SRT is based on a solids mass balance over the aeration tanks and clarifiers. Specifically, it depends on the influent wastewater forward flow rate into the aeration tanks, the clarifier underflow rate, the waste sludge flow rate and aeration tank volume in service. It eliminates the need for costly TSS sampling at various points in the process, along with its associated measurement variation and time lags. During this study, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> produced an SRT that agreed with conventional estimation methods, i. e. mass under aeration divided by mass flow rate wasted, when the conventional methods were corrected for solids inventory in the clarifiers. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> of SRT provides a simple, real-time calculation to adjust wasting flow rates of return sludge to maintain a target SRT and a stable microbial population. At the Seneca WWTP, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> of SRT, combined with gently air-mixed inlet aeration zones, simplified process control, reduced O&M costs, and produced an excellent effluent quality that averaged 4. 6 mg/l TSS, 3. 6 mg/l BOD, 0. 58 mg / l total phosphorus and 0. 14 mg/l ammonia...|$|R

40|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> {{systems of}} {{butterfly}} valves are presently valve-controlled and pump-controlled. Valve-controlled hydraulic systems have serious power loss and generate much heat during throttling. Pump-controlled hydraulic systems have no overflow or throttling losses but {{are limited in}} the speed adjustment of the variable-displacement pump, generate much noise, pollute the environment, and have motor power that does not match load requirements, resulting in low efficiency under light loads and wearing of the variable-displacement pump. To overcome these shortcomings, this article designs a closed <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> system in which an AC servo motor drives a quantitative pump that controls a spiral swinging hydraulic cylinder, and analyzes and calculates the structure and parameters of a spiral swinging hydraulic cylinder. The hydraulic system adjusts the servo motor’s speed {{according to the requirements}} of the control system, and the motor power matches the power provided to components, thus eliminating the throttling loss of hydraulic circuits. The system is compact, produces a large output force, provides stable transmission, has a quick response, and is suitable as a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> system of a large butterfly valve...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the development of}} a condition monitoring procedure for mechanical parts which involves time series higher-order spectra analysis. Several approaches based on autoregressive (AR) bispectrum, trispectrum and its slices are investigated as data mining techniques in the fault diagnosis of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> valves. The characteristics of vibration signals obtained from the control valves have been extracted by means of analyzing the 2 -dimensional and diagonal slices of bispectrum and trispectrum, with the main goal of detecting a possible working condition including the normal and fault conditions. The experimental analysis shows that there are distinct bump values {{in the center of the}} two-dimensional slices of trispectrum space in the fault conditions, on the contrast, the bump values disappear in normal condition. Comparisons have been done between trispectrum and bispectrum. Results show the slices of the trispectrum reveal the corresponding bispectrum and its slices for diagnosing the faults of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> valves. The experimental and theoretical results have indicated that trispectrum is a more suitable tool for diagnosing the faults of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>control</b> valves. ...|$|R
