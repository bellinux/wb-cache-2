5|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} and depression {{are the most}} common mental health issues for women. <b>Depression</b> <b>is</b> reported among lesbians at a rate similar to heterosexual women, although generalized anxiety disorder is more likely to appear among lesbian and bisexual women than heterosexual women. <b>Depression</b> <b>is</b> a more significant problem among women who feel they must hide their sexual orientation from friends and family, or experience compounded ethnic or religious discrimination, or endure relationship difficulties with no support system. Men's shaping of women's sexuality has proven to have an effect on how lesbians see their own bodies. Studies have shown that heterosexual men and lesbians have different standards for what they consider attractive in women. Lesbians who view themselves with male standards of female beauty may experience lower self-esteem, eating disorders, and higher incidence of depression. More than half the respondents to a 1994 survey of health issues in lesbians reported they had suicidal thoughts, and 18% had attempted suicide.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 24–45% {{of people}} with SCI suffer disorders of depression, and the suicide rate is as much as six {{times that of the}} rest of the population. The risk of suicide is worst in the first five years after injury. In young people with SCI, suicide is the leading cause of death. <b>Depression</b> <b>is</b> associated with an increased risk of other complications such as UTI and pressure ulcers that occur more when self-care is neglected.|$|E
5|$|Anxiety {{associated}} with <b>depression</b> <b>is</b> responsive to alprazolam. Clinical {{studies have shown}} that the effectiveness is limited to 4 months for anxiety disorders. However, the research into antidepressant properties of alprazolam is poor and has only assessed its short-term effects against depression. In one study, some long term, high-dosage users of alprazolam developed reversible depression. In the US, alprazolam is FDA-approved for the management of anxiety disorders (a condition corresponding most closely to the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder) or the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety. In the UK, alprazolam is recommended for the short-term treatment (2–4 weeks) of severe acute anxiety.|$|E

5|$|In late August, a {{tropical}} wave exited {{the west coast}} of Africa, developing into {{a tropical}} depression developed near Cape Verde on August28. It moved west-southwestward for two days before turning to the west. The <b>depression</b> <b>is</b> estimated to have intensified into a tropical storm on August31, and subsequently it turned to the west-northwest. On September2, the S.S. Umatilla reported winds up to force12 on the Beaufort scale, or hurricane strength; the ship also reported very high seas and a rapidly decreasing pressure. Based on the report, the Miami Weather Bureau office initiated advisories on Hurricane Carol about 750miles (1200km) east-northeast of Barbados.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Anxiety and <b>depression</b> <b>are</b> highly {{prevalent}} {{in patients with}} {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) and their informal carers, and associated with numerous risk factors. However, few studies have investigated these in primary care or the link between patient and carer anxiety and depression. We aimed to determine this association, and factors associated with anxiety and depression in patients, carers, and both in a dyad, in a population-based sample. Methods: Prospective, cross-sectional analysis of data from 119 advanced COPD patients and their carers. Patient and carer scores ≥ 8 on the Hospital Anxiety and <b>Depression</b> Scale <b>were</b> defined as cases of anxiety and depression; Chi-square, independent-t and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to determine variables significantly associated with these. Patient-carer dyads were categorised into four groups relating to the presence of anxiety or depression: (1) in both the patient and carer, (2) patient only, (3) carer only and (4) neither; factors associated with dyad anxiety or <b>depression</b> <b>were</b> determined with Chi-square, one-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results: Prevalence of anxiety and <b>depression</b> <b>was</b> 46. 4 % (n= 52) and 42. 9 % (n= 48) in patients, and 46. 0 % (n= 52) and 23. 0 % (n= 26) in carers, respectively. Patient and carer anxiety and <b>depression</b> <b>were</b> significantly associated. Patient anxiety and <b>depression</b> <b>was</b> also significantly associated with younger age, more physical co-morbidities, more exacerbations, greater dyspnoea, greater fatigue, and poor mastery. Carer anxiety and <b>depression</b> <b>was</b> significantly associated with younger age, being female and separated/divorced/widowed, higher educational level, more physical co-morbidities, unmet support needs, greater subjective caring burden and poor patient mastery. Dyad anxiety or <b>depression</b> <b>was</b> significantly associated with greater patient fatigue. Conclusion: Anxiety and depression of patients and carers are associated. Dyad anxiety or <b>depression</b> <b>was</b> associated with greater patient fatigue. It is necessary to identify and address patient, carer and dyad psychological morbidity in advanced COPD...|$|R

5|$|No <b>Depression</b> <b>is</b> {{the first}} studio album by {{alternative}} country band Uncle Tupelo, released in June 1990. After its {{formation in the}} late 1980s, Uncle Tupelo recorded the Not Forever, Just for Now demo tape, which received a positive review by the College Media Journal in 1989. The review led to the band's signing with what would become Rockville Records later that year. The album was recorded with producers Sean Slade and Paul Q. Kolderie at Fort Apache Studios, on a budget of US$3,500.|$|E
5|$|When the {{pressure}} within the skull (intracranial pressure, abbreviated ICP) rises too high, {{it can be}} deadly. Signs of increased ICP include decreasing level of consciousness, paralysis or weakness {{on one side of}} the body, and a blown pupil, one that fails to constrict in response to light or is slow to do so. Cushing's triad, a slow heart rate with high blood pressure and respiratory <b>depression</b> <b>is</b> a classic manifestation of significantly raised ICP. Anisocoria, unequal pupil size, is another sign of serious TBI. Abnormal posturing, a characteristic positioning of the limbs caused by severe diffuse injury or high ICP, is an ominous sign.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast on September1. Due to entrainment of dry air, the wave struggled to maintain convection as it progressed westwards. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not begin monitoring the system in its Tropical Weather Outlooks until a concentrated {{area of low pressure}} developed about 350mi (560km) east of the Leeward Islands on September8. The convection quickly diminished and mainly consisted of only sporadically bursts of shower and thunderstorm activity. Little change in organization took place as the disturbance tracked through the Bahamas on September11 and September12. However, the disturbance quickly organized and developed more thunderstorm activity while approaching Florida. A tropical <b>depression</b> <b>is</b> estimated to have formed at 06:00UTC on September13, around the time it was making landfall in Jensen Beach, Florida. Within a few hours, a strong band of deep convection formed in the northeast quadrant of the cyclone, though westerly wind shear prevented any significant convection from developing on the western side of the storm.|$|E

5|$|A wake low, or wake <b>depression,</b> <b>is</b> a {{mesoscale}} low-pressure {{area which}} trails the mesoscale high following a squall line. Due to the subsiding warm air {{associated with the}} systems formation, clearing skies {{are associated with the}} wake low. Once difficult to detect in surface weather observations due to their broad spacing, the formation of mesoscale weather station networks, or mesonets, has increased their detection. Severe weather, in the form of high winds, can be generated by the wake low when the pressure difference between the mesohigh preceding it and the wake low is intense enough. When the squall line {{is in the process of}} decay, heat bursts can be generated near the wake low. Once new thunderstorm activity along the squall line concludes, the wake low associated with it weakens in tandem.|$|E
5|$|Almost 25% {{of women}} will {{experience}} {{mental health issues}} over their lifetime. Women are at higher risk than men from anxiety, depression, and psychosomatic complaints. Globally, <b>depression</b> <b>is</b> the leading disease burden. In the United States, women have depression twice as often as men. The economic costs of depression in American women {{are estimated to be}} $20 billion every year. The risks of depression in women have been linked to changing hormonal environment that women experience, including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth and the menopause. Women also metabolise drugs used to treat depression differently to men. Suicide rates are less in women than men (<1% vs. 2.4%), but are a leading cause of death for women under the age of 60.|$|E
5|$|Behavior {{and mood}} {{alterations}} {{are more common}} in PD without cognitive impairment than in the general population, and are usually present in PD with dementia. The most frequent mood difficulties are depression, apathy, and anxiety. Establishing the diagnosis of <b>depression</b> <b>is</b> {{complicated by the fact}} that the body language of depression may masquerade as PD including a sad expressionless anxious face, a hang dog appearance, slow movement, and monotonous speech. Up to 30% of people with PD may experience symptoms of anxiety, ranging from a generalized anxiety disorder to social phobia, panic disorders and obsessive compulsive disorders. They contribute to impaired quality of life and increased severity of motor symptoms such as on/off fluctuations or freezing episodes.|$|E

5|$|Fatigue: fatigue is {{very common}} and {{disabling}} in MS, {{and at the same}} time it has a close relationship with depressive symptomatology. When <b>depression</b> <b>is</b> reduced fatigue also tends to improve, so patients should be evaluated for depression before other therapeutic approaches are used. In a similar way, other factors such as disturbed sleep, chronic pain, poor nutrition, or even some medications can contribute to fatigue; medical professionals are therefore encouraged to identify and modify them. A few medications have been studied to treat MS-related fatigue, such as amantadine pemoline (which is a psychostimulant also used for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy), or modafinil, as well as psychological interventions of energy conservation, but the effects of all of them are small. Fatigue is therefore a very difficult symptom to manage for which no drugs are recommended.|$|E
5|$|Major {{depressive}} disorder (MDD), {{also known}} simply as <b>depression,</b> <b>is</b> a mental disorder characterized by {{at least two weeks}} of low mood that is present across most situations. It is often accompanied by low self-esteem, loss of interest in normally enjoyable activities, low energy, and pain without a clear cause. People may also occasionally have false beliefs or see or hear things that others cannot. Some people have periods of depression separated by years in which they are normal while others nearly always have symptoms present. Major depressive disorder can negatively affect a person's personal, work, or school life, as well as sleeping, eating habits, and general health. Between 2–7% of adults with major depression die by suicide, and up to 60% of people who die by suicide had depression or another mood disorder.|$|E
5|$|Tertiary sexual {{dysfunction}} results from {{psychological and social}} factors. Reduced libido, desire, or experience of arousal {{could be due to}} psychological or situational factors such as depression, anxiety, and changes in relationships. Both sexes experience reduced sexual desire after SCI, and almost half of men and almost three quarters of women have trouble becoming psychologically aroused. <b>Depression</b> <b>is</b> {{the most common cause of}} problems with arousal in people with SCI. People frequently experience grief and despair initially after the injury. Anxiety and drug and alcohol abuse may increase after discharge from a hospital as new challenges occur, which can exacerbate sexual difficulties. Drug and alcohol abuse increase unhealthy behaviors, straining relationships and social functioning.|$|E

5000|$|In [...] "World Peace - The Transition", Author Edward Tilley {{presents}} {{research to}} suggest that these economic booms and <b>depressions</b> <b>are</b> the natural result of climbing inequity and normal Capitalism. As opportunity wains {{near the end of}} a long wave cycle, deep recessions and <b>depressions</b> <b>are</b> created which in history have resulted in either a war or revolution in approximately 20% of cases; 80% of the time, however, <b>depressions</b> <b>were</b> ended when inequity was reset by government policy and wealth distributions. The Great Depression of 1935 for example, was ended by the California Gold Rush; an event which multiplied the gold reserves of the U.S. by 10-times. Perhaps a dozen <b>Depressions</b> <b>were</b> averted by the Hammurabi Code's Economic Control of 50-year Jubilees in history, but this tool worked within a Monarchy. In a Democracy, all voters would have to be trained to insist on and vote for these economic controls that reset inequity, or <b>depressions</b> must <b>be</b> inevitable. Tilley composed a Civics Course designed to give Grade 10 students this training as well.|$|R
5|$|Difficulty delaying {{gratification}} {{also plays}} a role in internalizing disorders like anxiety and depression. A hallmark behavior in anxiety is avoidance of feared or anxiety-provoking situations. By seeking the immediate relief that comes with avoidance, a person is succumbing to the pull of instant gratification over the larger reward from overcoming the fear and anxiety that caused the avoidance. Procrastination, which is often a reflection of anxiety, is a clear example: a person avoids a dreaded task by engaging in a more enjoyable immediate activity instead. Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a more jarring case of this anxiety-related struggle to delay gratification; someone with OCD is unable to resist compulsions that temporarily mitigate the torture of obsessive thoughts, even though these compulsions do not banish the obsessions in the long run. One experiment, however, did not find any significant differences between samples with OCD and healthy controls in delayed gratification, while finding substantially improved delayed gratification among those with obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. <b>Depression</b> <b>is</b> also associated with lower capacity to delay gratification, though the direction of cause and effect is not clear. A depressed person who has difficulty pushing him or herself to engage in previously enjoyed activities is (deliberately or not) prioritizing short-term comfort and is demonstrating an impaired ability to delay gratification. There is evidence that individuals who engage in deliberate self-harm (i.e., cut themselves) are less able to tolerate emotional distress but are more able to tolerate physical pain. Thus it is argued that they injure themselves because they cannot delay gratification and need a way to end emotional pain quickly.|$|E
