We use data from a Eurobarometer Survey conducted in November 2014 to assess the determinants of <b>individual</b> <b>approval</b> or disapproval of TTIP by European citizens. By means of a mixed-level logit regression it can be shown that disapproval is highly correlated with a lack of trust in European institutions and in large companies.

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the credit}} process in banks. Specifically, it describes the credit process {{running from the}} very beginning when a client asks for a bank loan to the final moment when he/she pays the last installment. In addition, the author explains individual steps made by banks throughout the entire repayment period and their measures adopted at the moment when a client is unable to settle his/her loan. The thesis also includes calculations used in assessing the profitability of granted credits. Furthermore, it deals with methods of distributing credits to <b>individual</b> <b>approval</b> levels, i. e. if a credit can be approved directly in a client's branch or whether the approval must be given at a nationwide level. It offers a hypothesis that the standard method of determining these approval levels is ineffective and proposes a new distribution method.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this Master's Thesis is a {{description}} of administrative and similar proceedings leading to issue of permits, consents, statements and expert opinions needed {{for the implementation of}} entrepreneurial plans that could potentially have negative impacts on the environment. This Thesis describes the process of environmental impact assessment (so called EIA) and its specifics, as well as its relevance for further administrative proceedings. Other subject of analyses is the integrated permit, a document that substitutes selected individual administrative deeds, and also the very permits, consents and statements intended to protect the individual environmental departments (such as air, water, landscape) or to regulate environmentally relevant activities (e. g. waste treatment). Subject of analyses are also the permission procedures pursuant to the Construction Act that ensure the protection of the common public interest on environment protection by the means of so called binding opinions of environmental protection authorities necessary in the land-use and construction permit issue proceedings as well as in other land-use planning activities. The aim of this Thesis is to describe specific aspects of the <b>individual</b> <b>approval</b> proceedings and their mutual procedural and factual correlation in order to eliminate interpretation difficulties caused by the fragmented legal regulation in the area of environmental protection legislation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractVoting power {{theories}} {{measure the}} ability of voters to influence the outcome of an election under a given voting rule. In general, each theory gives a different evaluation of power, raising the question of their appropriateness, and calling for the need to identify classes of rules for which different theories agree. We study the ordinal equivalence of the generalizations of the classical power concepts–the influence relation, the Banzhaf power index, and the Shapley–Shubik power index–to multi-choice organizations and political rules. Under such rules, each voter chooses a level of support for a social goal from a finite list of options, and these individual choices are aggregated to determine the collective level of support for this goal. We show that the power theories analyzed do not always yield the same power relationships among voters. Thanks to necessary and/or sufficient conditions, we identify a large class of rules for which ordinal equivalence obtains. Furthermore, we prove that ordinal equivalence obtains for all linear rules allowing a fixed number of <b>individual</b> <b>approval</b> levels {{if and only if}} that number does not exceed three. Our findings generalize all the previous results on the ordinal equivalence of the classical power theories, and show that the condition of linearity found to be necessary and sufficient for ordinal equivalence to obtain when voters have at most three options to choose from is no longer sufficient when they can choose from a list of four or more options...|$|E

40|$|Although recent FDA {{approvals}} on ipilimumab and sipuleucel-T represent major milestones, {{the ultimate}} success of immunotherapy approaches will likely benefit from appropriate combinations with other immunotherapeutic and/or non-immunotherapeutic approaches. However, implementation of ideal combinations {{in the clinic}} may still face formidable challenges in regulatory, drug-availability and intellectual property aspects. The 2011 SITC annual meeting hosted a workshop on combination immunotherapy to discuss: 1) the most promising combinations found in the laboratory; 2) early success of combination immunotherapy in clinical trials; 3) industry perspectives on combination approaches, and 4) relevant regulatory issues. The integrated theme was how to accelerate the implementation of efficacious combined immunotherapies for cancer patients. Rodent animal models are providing many examples of synergistic combinations that typically include more than two agents. However, mouse and human immunology differ in {{a significant number of}} mechanisms and hence we might be missing opportunities peculiar to humans. Nonetheless, incisive animal experimentation with deep mechanistic insight remains the best compass that we can use to guide our paths in combinatorial immunotherapy. Combination immunotherapy clinical trials are already in progress and preliminary results are extremely promising. As a key to translate promising combinations into clinic, real and “perceived” business and regulatory hurdles were debated. A formidable step forward would be to be able to test combinations of investigational agents prior to <b>individual</b> <b>approval.</b> Taking together the FDA and the industrial perspective on combinatorial immunotherapy, the audience was left with the clear message that this is by no means an impossible task. The general perception is that the road ahead of us is full of combination clinical trials which hopefully will bring clinical benefit to our cancer patients at a fast pace...|$|E
40|$|Using Tinto's {{longitudinal}} {{model of}} institutional departure as the theoretical {{basis for this}} research, {{the purpose was to}} determine what extent selected motivational factors measured by the College Student Inventory (CSI) predict academic success and persistence of at-risk students at the University of North Texas (UNT). The study focused on United States citizens and permanent residents entering UNT as at-risk first-time freshmen admitted via <b>individual</b> <b>approval</b> for the fall 1994 semester. The 409 subjects were enrolled in a developmental course titled Personal and Academic Effectiveness where the CSI was administered during the first 2 weeks of class. Selected predictor variables were tested in relation to the separate criterion variables of grade point average and enrolled status during the 2 nd and 4 th years of the study. Grade point averages and enrollment data for the 1995 - 96 and 1997 - 98 academic years were extracted from the student information management system. The research design employed appropriate multiple regressions, multiple correlations, multiple discriminant analyses, and bivariate correlations. Findings confirmed the ability of five CSI factors to predict grade point average (p <. 05) of at-risk students over the time frames used in this study. Nine factors predicting enrolled status were also significant at the. 05 level; however, results were not meaningful in the 2 nd year as factors classified 95 % of all subjects as persisters. By the end of the 4 th year, the factors were able to predict correct classification of both persisters and nonpersisters approximately 24 % better than chance. This research provides support for Tinto's institutional departure model, particularly associated with pre-entry attributes and goals/commitments over time. The CSI is a viable instrument for use with at-risk first-time freshmen at a metropolitan university; however, required enrollment in a developmental course likely confounded the ability of selected variables to meaningfully predict enrolled status during the 2 nd year...|$|E
40|$|TRACER (Tracing and Control of Engineering Requirements) is a database/word {{processing}} system created to document {{and maintain the}} order of both requirements and descriptive material associated with an engineering project. A set of hierarchical documents are normally generated for a project whereby {{the requirements of the}} higher level documents levy requirements on the same level or lower level documents. Traditionally, the requirements are handled almost entirely by manual paper methods. The problem with a typical paper system, however, is that requirements written and changed continuously in different areas lead to misunderstandings and noncompliance. The purpose of TRACER is to automate the capture, tracing, reviewing, and managing of requirements for an engineering project. The engineering project still requires communications, negotiations, interactions, and iterations among people and organizations, but TRACER promotes succinct and precise identification and treatment of real requirements separate from the descriptive prose in a document. TRACER permits the documentation of an engineering project's requirements and progress in a logical, controllable, traceable manner. TRACER's attributes include the presentation of current requirements and status from any linked computer terminal and the ability to differentiate headers and descriptive material from the requirements. Related requirements can be linked and traced. The program also enables portions of documents to be printed, <b>individual</b> <b>approval</b> and release of requirements, and the tracing of requirements down into the equipment specification. Requirement "links" can be made "pending" and invisible to others until the pending link is made "binding". Individuals affected by linked requirements can be notified of significant changes with acknowledgement of the changes required. An unlimited number of documents can be created for a project and an ASCII import feature permits existing documents to be incorporated. TRACER can automatically renumber section headers when inserting or deleting sections of a document and generate sign-off forms for any approval process as well as a table of contents. TRACER was implemented on an IBM PC under PC-DOS. The program requires 640 K RAM, a hard disk, and PC-DOS version 3. 3 or higher. It was written in CLIPPER (Summer ' 87). TRACER is available on two 5. 25 inch 1. 2 Mb MS-DOS format diskettes. The executable program is also provided with the distribution. TRACER is a copyrighted work with all copyright vested in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. IBM PC and PC-DOS are registered trademarks of International Business Machines.
