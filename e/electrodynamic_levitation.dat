50|$|Magnetic {{river is}} a <b>electrodynamic</b> {{magnetic}} <b>levitation</b> (maglev) system designed by Fredrick Eastham and Eric Laithwaite in 1974. It {{consists of a}} thin conductive plate on an AC linear induction motor. Due to the transverse flux and the geometry, this gives it lift, stability and propulsion {{as well as being}} relatively efficient. The name refers to the action that provides stability along the longitudinal axis, which acts similar to the flow of water in a river.|$|R

This occurs in single sided motors, and levitation will not usually occur when an iron backing plate is used on the secondary, since this causes an attraction that overwhelms the lifting force.|$|E

40|$|As known <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>levitation</b> occurs without {{active control}} due to motion induced eddy currents. There {{are two main}} {{drawbacks}} related to electromagnetic bearings: 1) the presence of losses caused by the eddy currents, and 2) the onset of instability in undamped supercritical rotor systems. Accurate analysis of these devices, especially when the axial symmetry cannot be assumed, can be performed by numerical methods only. This paper {{presents a comparison between}} the experimental data taken on a prototype of an electrodynamic bearing and the numerical simulations obtained by a research code. The good agreement envisages the use of this code for the reduction of losses and for a better characterization of the instability conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis was to {{investigate}} the effect that droplet surface potential has upon nucleation of a solute from levitated solution droplets; there being virtually no such investigations thereof in the current literature. An increase in droplet surface potential resulted in significant promotion to solute nucleation, as determined by the number of crystals observed, for sodium chloride, ammonium nitrate, α-cyano- 4 -hydroxycinnamic acid, and 2, 4, 6 -trihydroxyacetophenone monohydrate solution droplets that were individually levitated using an <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>levitation</b> trap. A change in NaCl crystal habit was also observed for a population of levitated droplets once a surface charge density threshold of ~ 9 × 10 - 4 e•nm- 2 was surpassed; but was not observed for individually levitated droplets. Since the effects of surface potential and the presence of an external electric field on solute nucleation cannot be differentiated using an <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>levitation</b> trap as a means of levitation, an acoustic levitator was designed and constructed for this purpose. For acoustically levitated NaCl solution drops, both the presence of drop surface potential (SCDmax ~ ± 3. 44 x 10 - 4 e•nm- 2) and an external electric field (Eext = 6. 0 x 105 Vm- 1) were each found to promote solute nucleation as determined by {{the increase in the number}} of crystals observed in each drop relative to the number of crystals observed in the absence of drop surface potential and Eext. The effect of both drop surface potential and the presence of Eext on the crystallization of the concomitant dimorphic m-nitrophenol and trimorphic anthranilic acid systems with respect to polymorphic fraction were investigated for acoustically levitated solution drops. For anthranilic acid trials conducted in n-butanol under conditions of negative drop surface potential, the polymorphic ratio changed from approximately 0 : 100 : 0 to 0 : 91 : 9 (form I : form II : form III). A more dramatic shift to approximately 0 : 68 : 32 was observed for the same solution drops in the presence of Eext. The enhancement of form III appeared correlated to the decreases observed in drop supersaturation. No change in polymorphic ratio was observed for m-nitrophenol drops under similar conditions...|$|E
40|$|Thermophoretic, diffusiophoretic and radiometric {{forces on}} microparticles are being {{measured}} {{over a wide}} range of gas phase and particle conditions using <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>levitation</b> of single particles to simulate microgravity conditions. The thermophoretic force, which arises when a particle exists in a gas having a temperature gradient, is measured by levitating an electrically charged particle between heated and cooled plates mounted in a vacuum chamber. The diffusiophoretic force arising from a concentration gradient in the gas phase is measured in a similar manner except that the heat exchangers are coated with liquids to establish a vapor concentration gradient. These phoretic forces and the radiation pressure force acting on a particle are measured directly in terms of the change in the dc field required to levitate the particle with and without the force applied. The apparatus developed for the research and the experimental techniques are discussed, and results obtained by thermophoresis experiments are presented. The determination of the momentum and energy accommodation coefficients associated with molecular collisions between gases molecules and particles and the measurement of the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and small particles are of particular interest...|$|E
40|$|Combustion {{of metals}} in {{carbon dioxide is}} a {{promising}} source of energy for propulsion on Mars. This approach {{is based on the}} ability of some metals (e. g. Mg, Al) to burn in CO 2 atmosphere and suggests use of the Martian carbon dioxide as an oxidizer in jet or rocket engines. Analysis shows that CO 2 /metal propulsion will reduce significantly the mass of propellant transported from Earth for long-range mobility on Mars and sample return missions. Recent calculations for the near-term missions indicate that a 200 -kg ballistic hopper with CO 2 /metal rocket engines and a CO 2 acquisition unit can perform 10 - 15 flights on Mars with the total range of 10 - 15 km, i. e. fulfill the exploration program typically assigned for a rover. Magnesium is currently recognized as a candidate fuel for such engines owing to easy ignition and fast burning in CO 2. Aluminum may be more advantageous if a method for reducing its ignition temperature is found. Coating it by nickel is one such method. It is known that a thin nickel layer of nickel on the surface of aluminum particles can prevent their agglomeration and simultaneously facilitate their ignition, thus increasing the efficiency of aluminized propellants. Combustion of single Ni-coated Al particles in different gas environments (O 2, CO 2, air) was studied using <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>levitation</b> and laser ignition. It was shown that the combustion mechanisms depend on the ambient atmosphere. Combustion in CO 2 is characterized by the smaller size and lower brightness of flame than in O 2, and by phenomena such as micro-flashes and fragment ejection. The size and brightness of flame gradually decrease as the particle burns...|$|E
40|$|This project {{seeks to}} develop a {{prototype}} system {{for the analysis of}} single levitated micrometre-sized particles captured from an ambient aerosol. The system is designed to use Raman scattering to establish chemical nature of the particle, whilst simultaneously recording spatial elastic light scattering data from which an assessment of particle size, shape, and physical structure may be achieved. This multi-parametric approach should provide a means of discriminating atmospheric particles whose toxicity is determined by morphology as well as chemical composition. Areas of application could include environmental monitoring, source apportionment, occupational air-quality investigation, and potentially as part of a strategy for bio-aerosol detection. The prototype SPaRS comprises several distinct sub-systems: a particle charging unit to allow sufficient charging of particles down to micrometre-sizes for their entrainment and capture from a sample aerosol flow; an <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>levitation</b> chamber capable of holding the captured particle essentially stationary whilst measurements are recorded; a diode laser particle illumination system; a Raman scattering spectrometer; and a spatial light scattering acquisition sub-system. Integration of the sub-systems to complete a laboratory prototype is underway {{and the use of the}} system will continue under a DSTL funded studentship (Dalley). Particle Charging and Trapping Single particles drawn from the ambient air are held still in an electrodynamic balance (EDB) for analysis. To capture and hold them adequately, particles must be charged sufficiently to enable them to be trapped in the EDB’s electric field. The AC unipolar charger used in this instrument provides a very effective method of charging particles. Initially, the charged particles will be collected on a grounded plate, and then selected with a tungsten needle and launched through a hole in the top of the trap.

40|$|Magnetic {{bearings}} are systems {{capable of}} supporting rotors in absence of mechanical contact. Among many advantages {{with respect to}} ball and roller bearings are the possibilities of operating at extremely high rotational speeds and free of maintenance. Nevertheless, classical active magnetic bearings (AMB) are costly systems and may suffer from reliability problems. The most common types of passive magnetic bearings (PMB) based {{on the use of}} permanent magnet and reluctance forces are robust and relatively cheap but are affected by an intrinsic stability problem related to negative stiffness. The alternative of superconducting bearings has to deal with the difficulties for guaranteeing low temperatures for the superconducting materials to work; this represents a barrier for this technology. In the last decades an alternative for obtaining stable passive magnetic levitation has been searched, leading to the development of electrodynamic bearings. These systems, capable of realizing electrodynamic suspension for rotors using regular materials at room temperature, may be an alternative for the suspension of high rotational speed machines in the near future. The technological solutions proposed are still unable of devising a system capable of demonstrating the feasibility of this concept. Introduced in this context, this doctoral dissertation aims at developing models and design procedures to bring <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>levitation</b> of rotors closer to industrial applications. To this end, {{a large portion of the}} work is devoted to develop a unified model for representing the electromechanical interaction between rotor and stator generated by electrodynamic bearings of different types, namely homopolar and heteropolar configurations. The electromechanical model is developed taking advantage of the complex coordinate representation, typical in rotordynamics, in order to enable easy integration of the bearing's model with different rotordynamic models. An experimental validation of the model is carried out for homopolar configurations. The study of the dynamics of rotors on electrodynamic bearings is probably one of the most important aspects that must be dealt with before the bearings can reach the technological development needed to become industrially available. Bearing this in mind, the dynamics of a Jeffcott rotor and that of a four degree of freedom rotor are studied devoting special attention to the study of stability demonstrating the presence of unstable cylindrical and conical modes. The unbalance and frequency responses of the rotor on electrodynamic bearings are used to evidence the advantages and drawbacks between homopolar and heteropolar configurations. The studies are conduced using the state space formalism to obtain easy to manipulate system models. The modelling of the suspension evidences the strong coupling between the subsystems, showing that the influence of each subsystem on the rotordynamic stability is not obvious, thus complicating the design of the whole suspension. Considering an iterative design approach, the design of a test rig is presented. It is designed to test the validity of the models and the feasibility of radial electrodynamic suspension. A the mechanical layout of the test rig is developed to deal with the stability aspects introduced by the use of electrodynamic bearings...|$|E
40|$|Small {{particles}} {{suspended in}} non-isothermal gas and/or in an isothermal gas mixture with concentrations gradients of chemical species, experience a force, that is induced by thermal or concentration gradients. The particle motion is commonly termed thermophoresis and diffusiophoresis, respectively. Such phenomena are of considerable importance {{in a variety}} of engineering fields (coating of surfaces, gas cleaning, optical fiber production, advanced ceramics, nanophase materials, combustion processes, microcontamination control in the electronics industry, etc.). They certainly {{play a crucial role in}} the scavenging of aerosol particles in clouds, when droplets and/or ice crystals grow or evaporate, and below clouds, during the fall of hydrometeors. Experiments to measure the thermophoretic force or velocity have mainly been performed in normal gravity employing several different experimental methods: the modified Millikan cell with heated upper and cooled lower electrodes, the deflection of a particle suspended from a small wire, the penetration method, the <b>electrodynamic</b> <b>levitation</b> and the deflection of particles moving in a jet formed by a slit. 1),While in the free-molecule regime (Knudsen Waldmann’s theory (Waldmann, 1959) seems to be in good agreement with the experimental results, in the 0. 1) and in the transition regionslip-flow regime (Kn 10) previously published measurementsKn (0. 1 are contradictory. Talbot et al. (1980) observed that Brock’s thermal, is identical toforce (Brock, 1962), when Kn Waldmann’s equation, except for the multiplicative factor cs/cm, where cs is the thermal-slip coefficient and cm is the velocity-slip coefficient. As this ratio should be about unity, Talbot proposes an equation that should be valid throughout the entire interval 0 <Kn<, and suggests for cs, ct, cm the values 1. 17, 2. 18 and 1. 14, respectively. The transition regime is difficult to analyse. Numerical solutions of the integral transport equation for the BGK model have been attempted. The solutions of Yamamoto and Ishihara (1988), Loyalka (1992), and Ohwada and Sone (1992), all predict negative thermophoresis for sufficiently large values of the ratio between thermal conductivities of the particle and gas and for Kn< 0. 2. In normal gravity the thermophoretic effect cannot be studied alone, as particles move due to gravity force and eventually owing to natural convection. These difficulties can be avoided by utilizing a microgravity environment. Up to now only Toda et al. (1996, 1998) and Oostra (1998) have performed experiments in microgravity, in the drop tower facilities of JAMIC (10 - 5 g 0, t= 10 s) and Zarm, in Bremen (10 - 6 g 0, t= 4. 7 s), respectively. Concerning diffusiophoresis, a case of great interest occurs when vapour molecules are diffusing through resting air, i. e. when a Stephan flow exists. This phenomenon was studied theoretically and experimentally by Waldmann (1959), Schmitt and Waldmann (1960), Derjaguin et al. (1966), Kousaka and Endo (1993). As in the case of thermophoresis, the microgravity environment simplifies the problem, as it eliminates the continuous renewal of the vapour concentration field. So far there are no published data concerning diffusiophoretic velocities in microgravity...|$|E
