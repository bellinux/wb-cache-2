5000|$|One of Sturtevant’s {{principal}} contributions was {{his introduction}} to the concept that the frequency of crossing-over between two genes could help determine their proximity on a linear genetic map. His experiments determined that the frequency of double crossing over {{can be used to}} deduce gene order. He demonstrated this concept by constructing crosses of three segregating genes, called [...] "three-factor crosses". He found that using three genes as opposed to two provided most accurate information about gene order on chromosome. With this system, Sturtevant discovered that <b>double</b> <b>crossing-over</b> occurs at frequency of equal to or less than product of two single crossing over frequencies. He also surmised that unequal crossing-over was possibly a main force of evolution. [...] "Sturtevant... elaborated on these ideas by incorporating the conception of linear arrangement and by constructing the first chromosome map. Double crossing over and interference were deductions that arose from this result" [...] (Sturtevant, An Introduction to Genetics p. 361).|$|E

Marais, J. M. Bové, S. F. Dallo, J. B. Baseman, and J. Renaudin, J. Bacteriol. 175 : 2783 - 2787, 1993). We have now studied the structural instability of the recombinant RF leading to loss of the DNA insert. Analyses of viral clones with deletions have shown that both illegitimate and homologous recombination were involved in deletion formation. For one such clone, deletion has occurred via a <b>double</b> <b>crossing-over</b> exchange between the circular free viral RF and SpV 1 viral sequences present in the S. citri host chromosome. The homologous recombination process usually requires the RecA protein. However, characterization of the recA gene of the S. citri R 8 A 2 host strain revealed that over two-thirds of the open reading frame of the recA gene was deleted from the C-terminal part, indicating that this particular strain is probably RecA deficient...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} whether recurrent mutation {{has contributed to}} the high frequency of the beta E-globin gene in Southeast Asia, we used the haplotypes at three polymorphic restriction sites within and to the 3 ' side of the beta-globin gene to predict the framework of 23 beta E-globin genes. These haplotypes suggested that beta E-globin genes are present in two different beta-globin gene frameworks. DNA sequence determination of one gene representing each framework demonstrated that the same mutation (GAG leads to AAG at codon 26) was present in both frameworks. Moreover, the frameworks differed at three nucleotide positions known to be polymorphic in Mediterraneans. These polymorphic sites are located 70 nucleotides to the 5 ' side of the beta E mutation and 382 and 1032 nucleotides to the 3 ' side of it. The existence of the beta E mutation in these two beta-globin gene frameworks can be explained by (i) recurrent mutation giving rise to beta E-globin, (ii) a <b>double</b> <b>crossing-over</b> event, or (iii) two single crossing-over events. Mathematical analysis suggests that the first alternative, recurrent mutation of G leads to A at the first nucleotide of codon 26, is most likely...|$|E
40|$|A {{model to}} explain {{the high degree of}} {{polymorphism}} at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is described. The model incorporates domain transfer between the different loci in a supergene family by either gene conversion or <b>double</b> unequal <b>crossing-over.</b> Population genetics theory is used to formulate changes in the probabilities of allelic and nonallelic gene identities and equilibrium values are obtained. The observed degree of allelic and nonallelic homology in the complex can be explained by assuming that a domain is converted at a rate of 10 (- 5) to 10 (- 6) per generation and reasonable values of other parameters. This rate of domain transfer is compatible with the observed high mutation rate at marker loci in the major histocompatibility complex...|$|R
40|$|The {{nucleotide}} {{sequences of}} the constant portions of mouse immunoglobulin gamma 1 and gamma 2 b genes were compared. A remarkable homology {{was found in a}} long (about 500 nucleotides) continuous segment including the entire CH 1 coding region and about {{the first half of the}} first intervening sequence. Furthermore, comparison of amino acid sequences of four gamma-class chains revealed that the CH 1 domain shows limited divergence among gamma 1, gamma 2 a, and gamma 2 b. Interestingly, the homology region extends to the CH 2 domain in gamma 2 a and gamma 2 b. These findings suggest that, during their evolution, a <b>double</b> unequal <b>crossing-over</b> event has taken place at different intervening sequences, resulting in the transfer of the DNA segment coding for the CH 1 domain or CH 1 -CH 2 domains. A possible evolutionary implication for such an "intervening sequence-mediated domain transfer" event is discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} clarify the {{mechanisms}} responsible for the observed linkage disequilibrium, such as that found between markers in the major histocompatibility complex of man and mouse, linkage disequilibrium between two linked loci was studied for a finite population with a subdivided structure. The infinite allele model was used. In analogy with the subdivision of the inbreeding coefficient, the linkage disequilibrium coefficient was subdivided, and various variance components of disequilibrium were defined. It {{was found that the}} disequilibrium components may get very large when migration is limited if the correlation of alleles at the two loci within a colony is taken relative to that of the entire population. In other words, with limited migration, random genetic drift of gamete types prevails in each colony. A possible test in which the variance components of disequilibrium are compared is suggested; the test discriminates between epistatic natural selection and limited migration, showing the former as the main cause of the observed linkage disequilibrium. It is pointed out that the major histocompatibility complex polymorphism is in accord with the population genetics model of multigene families that incorporate gene conversion or <b>double</b> unequal <b>crossing-over</b> between the loci in the supergene family...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{describe}} a new cloning-free strategy to delete {{genes in the}} opportunistic pathogenic yeast Candida lusitaniae. We first constructed two ura 3 Δ strains in C. lusitaniae for their use in transformation experiments. One was deleted for the entire URA 3 coding sequence; the other possessed a partial deletion within the coding region, which {{was used to determine}} the minimum amount of homology required for efficient homologous recombination by <b>double</b> <b>crossing-over</b> of a linear DNA fragment restoring URA 3 expression. This amount was estimated to 200 bp {{on each side of the}} DNA fragment. These data constituted the basis of the development of a strategy to construct DNA cassettes for gene deletion by a cloning-free overlapping PCR method. Two cassettes were necessary in two successive transformation steps for the complete removal of a gene of interest. As an example, we report here the deletion of the LEU 2 gene. The first cassette was constituted by the URA 3 gene flanked by two large fragments (500 bp) homologous to the 5 ' and 3 ' non-coding regions of LEU 2. After transformation of an ura 3 Δ recipient strain and integration of the cassette at the LEU 2 locus, the URA 3 gene was removed by a second transformation round with a DNA cassette made by the fusion between the 5 ' and 3 ' non-coding regions of the LEU 2 gene. The overall procedure takes less than 2 weeks and allows the creation of a clean null mutant that retains no foreign DNA sequence integrated in its genome...|$|E
40|$|The {{nucleotide}} {{sequences of}} the immunoglobulin heavy-chain constant region genes of mouse, C gamma 3, C gamma 1, C gamma 2 b and C gamma 2 a, together {{with that of}} a human equivalent C gamma 4 were compared. All the six pairs of genes within the mouse C gamma gene family contain DNA segments that exhibit marked homology, whereas no such segmental homology was found in interspecies comparisons. This result indicates that the four C gamma genes of the mouse evolved concertedly by exchanging parts of their genetic information with each other either by gene conversion or by <b>double</b> unequal <b>crossing-over.</b> Another example of such concerted evolution was found in gene regions encoding membrane domains of the mouse C gamma chains. We also searched for such segmental homologies in other mammalian C gamma gene families and found at least two more examples in man and guinea-pig. In the mouse C gamma gene family, the silent positions of an exon encoding the third domain of C gamma chains show much greater divergence in sequence than other regions, indicating that the genetic information encoded by this gene region was least scrambled during recent evolution. A phylogenetic tree constructed from the nucleotide differences of this exon demonstrates that at least two C gamma genes had already existed before mammalian radiation. Based on these results, evolution of mammalian C gamma gene families is discussed...|$|R
40|$|From {{comparisons}} of homologous DNA sequences for many different genes, {{it was shown}} that the silent positions of protein-encoding regions and introns evolve at high and remarkably similar rates for different genes. In addition, both silent positions and introns behave like clocks; they accumulated base substitutions at approximately constant rates with respect to geological time. The rates of evolution were estimated to be 5. 5 X 10 (- 9), 3. 7 X 10 (- 9), and 5. 3 X 10 (- 9) per site per year for silent positions, short introns (less than approximately equal to 300 base pairs), and long introns (more than approximately equal to 500 base pairs), respectively. Contrary to expectation from the evolutionary clocks, DNA sequence comparison between pHLA 12. 4 (a cloned HLA sequence) of man and Ld together with other H- 2 genes of mouse, the class I genes of the major histocompatibility complex, revealed a surprisingly small amount of base substitution for both the introns and the silent positions; the degree of divergence is only about 60 % of that of standard genes in the same species comparison. Furthermore, several segmental homologies have been observed between the class I genes of mouse, suggesting the frequent occurrence of gene conversion or <b>double</b> unequal <b>crossing-over</b> in evolution. Interrelations between the extreme polymorphism of the class I genes, the low evolutionary drift of the introns and the silent positions, and the frequent gene conversion or unequal crossing-over within the mouse genes are discussed...|$|R
