I wanted it for myself. The lyric to 'Cocoon' was a whole diary, then I had to edit 90 per cent of it out. It's very hard to explain, but when I read it and the other person it's about reads it, we don't feel abused or anything. I think there's songs where I've been more... scruffy about what I'm expressing. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> music that's too indulgent.
