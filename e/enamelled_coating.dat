40|$|The {{protective}} {{performance of}} a sand particle-modified <b>enamel</b> <b>coating</b> on reinforcing steel bars was evaluated in 3. 5 wt% NaCl solution by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Seven percentages of sand particles by weight were investigated: 0 %, 5 %, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 50 % and 70 %. The phase composition of the <b>enamel</b> <b>coating</b> and sand particles were determined with the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. The surface and cross-sectional morphologies of the sand particle-modified <b>enamel</b> <b>coating</b> were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). XRD tests revealed three phases of sand particles: SiO 2, CaCO 3 and MgCO 3. SEM images demonstrated that the <b>enamel</b> <b>coating</b> wetted well with the sand particles. However, a weak <b>enamel</b> <b>coating</b> zone was formed around the sand particles due to concentrated air bubbles, leading to micro-cracks as hydrogen gas pressure builds up and exceeds the tensile strength of the weak zone. As a result, the addition of sand particles into the <b>enamel</b> <b>coating</b> reduced both the coating and corrosion resistances...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effects of}} using enamel as a {{protection}} against corrosion on external surfaces of thermosyphon economizers were studied. The thermosyphons used in the experiment were made of standard and <b>enamel</b> <b>coated</b> steel, and standard and <b>enamel</b> <b>coated</b> copper. Three different thicknesses of enamel were employed on the evaporator section. Thermosyphons with an OD of 25. 4 mm, with an evaporator and condenser section length of 0. 7 and 0. 3 m respectively, were installed in a modified economizer measuring 1. 2 x 1. 3 x 1. 5 m. The test was conducted using flue gas burned at a temperature of 225 C. generated from a mixture of heavy grade A fuel and diesel oil {{at a ratio of}} 4 : 1 by volume. Data was collected while monitoring the corrosion levels of the thermosyphons. Fouling with its thermal resistance was also recorded at 250, 500, 750 and 1, 000 hours respectively. It was found that, neither the direction of the flow of the flue gas nor the thickness of the <b>enamel</b> <b>coating</b> significantly affected the rate of corrosion, the fouling thickness, or the average rate of fouling. The average corrosion of 3 different thicknesses of <b>enamel</b> <b>coated</b> tubes for both the steel and copper tubes were 0. 038 mm. At the completion of 1, 000 hours the corrosion of the mild steel tube was 4. 9 times higher than the <b>enamel</b> <b>coated</b> tube and the corrosion of the standard copper tube was 4. 45 times higher than the <b>enamel</b> <b>coated</b> tube.

40|$|Abstract. Vitreous enamel is a glassy coating {{formed on}} a metal {{substrate}} by firing at temperatures above 800 °C. The quality of vitreous <b>enamel</b> <b>coating</b> depends on the pre-treatment of the steel substrate surface {{and the quality of}} enamel slip. The main aim {{of this study was to}} characterize the composition of the steel substrate surface after firing with double finish, to explain the effect of steel substrate surface pre-treatment (blasting, acid pickling) on forming the phase interface of the steel substrate – vitreous coating system, and on its final microhardness, fracture strength and the adhesive properties of the coating. To achieve these aims, the following experimental methods were used: Mössbauer spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, electron analyzer, and EDAX. Based on the chemical composition of the initial enamel slip and the firing technology, the metal- enamel system interface exhibited various ratios of layers of magnetite, hematite, nonstoichiometric wüstite, and crystals of faylite. The measuring results indicate that the quality and age of enamel slip influences the brittle fracture properties of vitreous <b>enamel</b> <b>coating...</b>|$|R

40|$|Using {{the distal}} molar of a minipig as a model, we studied {{changes in the}} {{microstructural}} characteristics of apatite crystallites during enamel maturation (16 - 23 months of postnatal age), and their effects upon the mechanical properties of the <b>enamel</b> <b>coat.</b> The slow rate of tooth development in a pig model enabled us to reveal essential heterochronies in particular components of the maturation process. The maturation changes began along the enamel-dentine junction (EDJ) of the trigonid, spreading subsequently to the outer layers of the <b>enamel</b> <b>coat</b> to appear at the surface zone with a 2 -month delay. Correspondingly, at the distal part of the tooth the timing of maturation processes is delayed by 3 - 5 month compared to the mesial part of the tooth. The early stage of enamel maturation (16 - 20 months), when the <b>enamel</b> <b>coat</b> is composed almost exclusively of radial prismatic enamel, {{is characterized by a}} gradual increase in crystallite thickness (by a mean monthly increment of 3. 8 nm); and an increase in the prism width and thickness of crystals composed of elementary crystallites. The late stage of maturation (the last two months prior to tooth eruption), marked with the rapid appearance of the interprismatic matrix (IPM) during which the crystals densely infill spaces between prisms, is characterized by an abrupt decrease in microstrain and abrupt changes in the micromechanical properties of the enamel: a rapid increase in its ability to resist long-term load and its considerable hardening. The results suggest that in terms of crystallization dynamics the processes characterizing the early and late stage of mammalian enamel maturation represent distinct entities. In regards to common features with enamel formation in the tribosphenic molar we argue that the separation of these processes could be a common apomorphy of mammalian amelogenetic dynamics in general...|$|R
