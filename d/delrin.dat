5|$|While blank {{variety is}} the {{defining}} demarcation between one Balabushka cue and another, {{there are some}} shared features spanning Balabushka's fleeting 16-year career. Cue forearms were characteristically made with straight-grained maple, based on Balabushka's belief that a single-direction maple grain provided superior integrity to that of curly maple or birdseye maple. He used stainless steel joints and <b>delrin</b> butt caps almost exclusively. A small number of his cues feature ivory joints and ivory butt caps, making them highly valued collector's items. Balabushka used a distinguishing reddish-brown bumper, and employed Cortland Irish linen for many of his wraps, with the highly sought after leather wrap a rare departure for him and a distinct value enhancer. Unless a different length was specified, Balabushka made all his cues to a standard 57½ inches in length.|$|E
25|$|In the jack, a {{plectrum}} juts {{out almost}} horizontally (normally the plectrum is angled upwards a tiny amount) and passes {{just under the}} string. Historically, plectra were made of bird quill or leather; many modern harpsichords have plastic (<b>delrin</b> or celcon) plectra.|$|E
25|$|The Solar Challenger was {{designed}} to be sturdier, more powerful, and more maneuverable than the Gossamer Penguin so as to be able to withstand sustained high-altitude flight and normal turbulence. It was over three times as heavy (without pilot) as the Gossamer Penguin and had a shorter wingspan, but was proportionately more powerful, with electricity supplied by 16,128 solar cells powering two three-horsepower motors. The solar panels were directly affixed to the wing and large horizontal stabilizer, both of which had to be flat on top to accommodate them. The two motors, each 3inches wide and 17inches long and incorporating samarium-cobalt permanent magnets, operated in tandem on a common shaft to drive a single, controllable-pitch propeller. The design incorporated advanced synthetic materials with very high strength to weight ratios, including Kevlar, Nomex, <b>Delrin,</b> Teflon, and Mylar, all supplied by the aircraft's sponsor, Dupont.|$|E
2500|$|Plastic {{materials}} {{played a}} very important part in the development and progress of electronic keyboards. Until [...] "monoblocks" [...] came along, GE's [...] "self-lubricating" [...] <b>Delrin</b> was the only plastic material for keyboard switch plungers that could withstand the beating over tens of millions of cycles of lifetime use. Greasing or oiling switch plungers was undesirable because it would attract dirt over time which would eventually affect the feel and even bind the key switches (although keyboard manufacturers would sometimes sneak this into their keyboards, especially if they could not control the tolerances of the key plungers and housings well enough to have a smooth key depression feel or prevent binding). But <b>Delrin</b> was only available in black and white, and was not suitable for keytops (too soft), so keytops use ABS plastic. [...] However, as plastic molding advanced in maintaining tight tolerances, and as key travel length reduced from 0.187-inch to 0.110-inch (4.75mm to 2.79mm), single-part keytop/plungers could be made of ABS, with the keyboard monolocks also made of ABS.|$|E
2500|$|In 1970, after tooling {{purchased}} from the Lionel Corporation {{was moved to}} a new factory in Mt. Clemens, Michigan, limited production of Lionel trains as a new product line under MPC began. Rolling stock debuted with [...] "fast-angle wheels" [...] with needlepoint bearings. This new wheel design, coupled with the use of <b>Delrin</b> plastic trucks, reduced rolling friction that allowed for longer trains to be run and is still in use by Lionel today. Lionel also began to offer trains in a wider variety of roadnames and colors and with improved graphics that were not previously available during the postwar period.|$|E
50|$|Excellent Finish: The {{injection}} molding of <b>Delrin</b> delivers a finely finished product. It {{does not need}} further coatings for shine enhancements. Therefore, <b>Delrin</b> zippers have a more natural finish that makes the overall appearance of the clothing and other items superb.|$|E
50|$|<b>Delrin</b> zipper has {{a perfect}} {{combination}} of physical properties {{that is not}} seen {{in any of the}} metals and most other plastics. <b>Delrin</b> is a thermoplastic engineering polymer manufactured by the polymerization of formaldehyde. Reliable performance of this plastic zipper (<b>Delrin</b> zipper) has gained it a wide-spread recognition all across the world. The main highlight of the zipper, <b>Delrin</b> was commercially introduced in 1960. Since then, it is continuously being used in various appliance, automotive, hardware and consumer goods industries. It is actually considered as the material of construction because it offers innumerable opportunities to the designers. It delivers a relatively longer life, improvised performance and increased freedom of styling to the common zippers.|$|E
50|$|Reduced Weight: <b>Delrin</b> zippers {{are strong}} and lightweight. They are {{extraordinarily}} good at weight savings than metal designs. It has all become {{possible because of}} the high strength and low weight ratio of <b>Delrin.</b> The finished zipper has a relatively lower weight than all other zippers manufactured from metals and other plastics.|$|E
50|$|Integral Colors: <b>Delrin</b> zippers {{are more}} {{colorful}} {{and can be}} easily manufactured in the required colors. The wide range of color availability in <b>Delrin</b> zippers is made possible because of using pre-colored molding resins. The high availability of varied colors has made these zippers the topmost choice of many items like outdoor tents, fancy wear for kids etc.|$|E
5000|$|Tobacco products: Electronic {{cigarettes}} and lighters. The BIC Group uses <b>Delrin</b> for their lighters.|$|E
50|$|Self-lubricated: <b>Delrin</b> has an {{inherent}} lubricity that {{eliminates the need}} for lubrication as faced with many metals and plastics. It ensures good wear life and effectually reduces the requirements for driving power. The low friction characteristics of these <b>Delrin</b> zippers offer smooth operation in whatever product they are integrated. This also diminishes the possibilities of contamination that usually occurs during the lubrication procedures.|$|E
5000|$|Acetal. Acetal is {{a highly}} durable class of plastics. <b>Delrin</b> is DuPont's trademarked name for a type of acetal. <b>Delrin</b> is hard, glossy and durable, and can also be doped to produce a matte texture. The {{friction}} between a steel or nickel guitar string, and smooth, glossy acetal is very low. Glossy <b>delrin</b> picks literally glide across the string and therefore have a fast release, producing very little pick noise, while delivering a rounded tone emphasizing the lower order harmonics. Matte finish acetal picks like the Clayton Acetal generate a bit more pick noise, and a more aggressive attack, but the additional friction of the matte surface helps the guitarist hold the pick more securely. Delrex is a variation of Tortex, which is by itself <b>Delrin.</b> It was invented to replace tortoiseshell since the trade of tortoiseshell was banned in 1973. Delrex is used as the material for Dunlop's [...] "gator" [...] picks.|$|E
50|$|In racing cars, {{bushings}} {{tend to be}} made of harder {{materials such}} as brass or <b>delrin.</b>|$|E

50|$|As when {{compared}} to nylon zipper, plastic zipper (<b>delrin</b> zipper) features higher strength. Therefore, they are extensively used for heavy-duty sportswear, girl’s wear, children’s wear, vehicle covers and storage bags. These zippers tend to handle water and impurities more efficiently and thus they are also considered an ideal choice for outdoor applications. Therefore, almost all the tents, boats and other such outdoor sources also use <b>Delrin</b> zippers. Plastic zipper chain is specifically designed {{in such a way}} that it offers two-way functionality. The sliders can be integrated on either side and they function flawlessly. <b>Delrin</b> has a wide gauge range from 3 to 30 where the increasing numbers denote a heavy weighing zipper with several pounds per yard.|$|E
50|$|Well-known {{makers in}} other {{materials}} include Doug Tipple (PVC), Des Seery (<b>Delrin)</b> and William (Billy) Miller (bamboo).|$|E

50|$|The {{remarkable}} {{attributes of}} <b>Delrin</b> owe {{a lot to}} its chemical composition, {{a high degree of}} crystallinity and regular molecular structure.|$|E
50|$|A plastic zipper, {{also known}} as a <b>Delrin</b> zipper, is a zipper made with {{polyester}} tape and molded POM elements. <b>Delrin</b> is a high-grade plastic that is molded in a form over the individual side of the zipper tape. These zippers are light in weight and can be colored to match the product they are fabricated for. They are more commonly known as molded zippers and have a larger bulk than coil zippers. Individually coupling of the teeth in these zippers interlocks seamlessly. In fact, they are almost similar to metal zippers in design because of the individually positioned teeth along the tape. The teeth are smartly injection molded onto a pre-woven, dyed tape. The degree of self-lubrication and sturdiness of <b>Delrin</b> zippers is far better than an equivalent size of coil zipper.|$|E
50|$|Spyder Xtra: The Xtra is {{an entry}} level {{mechanical}} marker that featured a two-finger trigger, an expansion chamber, {{and a top}} cocking <b>Delrin</b> Bolt.|$|E
5000|$|Delrex {{is used as}} the {{material}} for Dunlop's [...] "gator" [...] picks. The tortoise series are also made from <b>Delrin</b> but with a different surface.|$|E
50|$|All the {{high-end}} benefits of <b>Delrin</b> {{make it a}} picture-perfect choice for plastic zippers. Such zippers last long and perform exceptionally well anywhere they are incorporated.|$|E
5000|$|Typical tap handles are 9-13" [...] tall, but {{can range}} from very short (4") to novelty lengths (>13"). Most taps are {{assembled}} with a 4" [...] <b>delrin</b> handle.|$|E
50|$|Solvent and Chemical Resistance: The <b>Delrin</b> zippers will neither crack nor soften {{because of}} any {{unwanted}} chemical. They have an excellent resistance quality unlike various other kinds of plastic zippers.|$|E
50|$|Injection molding of <b>Delrin</b> {{provides}} {{freedom of}} styling to zipper manufacturers. It {{allows them to}} produce appealing geometric shapes which are otherwise not possible with metals {{and other kinds of}} plastic. Almost all the innovative techniques like snap/press fitting, self-threading screws, ultrasonic welding, riveting, and cold-heading can be effortlessly performed with this plastic. The zippers can also be colored, metallized, painted or printed after they are moulded. The overall success of the <b>Delrin</b> zipper depends on to a large extent on its quality, design and cost-effectiveness. The moulding process also adds some UV resistant polymers to these zippers which enable them to withstand UV degradation effectively.|$|E
50|$|Reels may be {{made from}} a wide variety of materials, but near neutral {{buoyancy}} and resistance to impact damage are desirable features, which are easiest to achieve in engineering polymers such as nylon, acetal (<b>delrin)</b> and polyethylene.|$|E
5000|$|The Promaster comes stock with a 12" [...] ported barrel with Autococker/Intimidator threads. The stock marker {{also comes}} with a four-way {{adjustable}} aluminum double trigger, electronic break-beam eye, <b>delrin</b> bolt, and quick pull pins for field stripping.|$|E
50|$|The core, foot {{deck and}} {{peduncle}} are constructed of anodized CNC machined aluminum. The flukes are {{a composite of}} rubber compression molded around an aluminum core frame. The hinge pin is 316 stainless steel with a <b>delrin</b> bearing.|$|E
50|$|A {{precision}} machined device from food grade Dupont <b>Delrin</b> engineered polymer, with {{a stainless steel}} wire bail. The device is applied with tape, and an elastic strap {{is attached to the}} bail for tugging. Through hole permits easy urination without removal of device.|$|E
5000|$|In the jack, a {{plectrum}} juts {{out almost}} horizontally (normally the plectrum is angled upwards a tiny amount) and passes {{just under the}} string. Historically, plectra were made of bird quill or leather; many modern harpsichords have plastic (<b>delrin</b> or celcon) plectra.|$|E
50|$|To {{prevent such}} damage, RDSO, Lucknow issued a {{guideline}} asking the Railways {{to provide a}} <b>delrin</b> liner below the Hytrel washers. However, it was indicated that these liners are to be provided only on new coaches and in coaches in which new wheels are fitted.|$|E
5000|$|In 1973, {{the trade}} of {{tortoiseshell}} worldwide was banned under CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species). [...] The material was already often imitated in stained horn, plastic and other materials, and this continues. The synthetic <b>Delrin</b> has been used especially for guitar picks.|$|E
50|$|In 1984 John Peters {{redesigned}} the De Martini bag using Cordura nylon, <b>delrin</b> buckles {{and reflective}} stripes {{and finished the}} bags with (industry first) cordura edge binding and hence {{set the stage for}} the messenger bag craze. His designs are now the industry standard for all modern messenger bags.|$|E
50|$|Reduced Noise: The {{mechanical}} {{noise that}} is usually associated with metal zippers is considerably reduced {{with the use of}} plastic zippers. Because of the innate lubrication and low friction, the <b>Delrin</b> zippers slide up and down smoothly and quietly. Thus, reduced noise is another benefit of these high-quality zippers.|$|E
