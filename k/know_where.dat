5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you had never thought of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if we went into Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you <b>know</b> <b>where</b> you begin. You never <b>know</b> <b>where</b> you are going to end.|$|E

60|$|Bertie Stanhope was not {{prone to}} be very diffident of his own {{conversational}} powers, but it did seem {{to him that he}} was about to tax them almost too far. He hardly <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> to begin, and he hardly <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> he should end.|$|R

5|$|As {{opposed to}} film makers, virtual camera system creators {{have to deal}} with a world that is {{interactive}} and unpredictable. It is not possible to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> the player's character {{is going to be in}} the next few seconds; therefore, it is not possible to plan the shots as a film maker would do. To solve this issue, the system relies on certain rules or artificial intelligence to select the most appropriate shots.|$|E

I just wanted to have that energy and have people going crazy. So I knew the fusion was putting R with trance.|$|E

5|$|It's about obsession, {{and that}} can be scary because you're not in control and you don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> it's going to stop. It says that, at any point in {{somebody}}'s life, when they loved somebody strongly enough and that person returns, a certain touch, a certain physical gesture can turn them from being defiant and disgusted with this person to being subservient again. And it's not just a pleasurable feeling that comes back, it's the complete terror and loss of control that comes back. And I think that's ultimately a great weapon.|$|E

5|$|The Mahabharata corroborates the Ramayana account. Vishvavasu tells Rama to {{seek the}} help of Sugriva, who would <b>know</b> <b>where</b> Ravana stays. Kabandha also assured Rama that he would {{definitely}} meet Sita again. In the Mahavira-charita, the divine person that leaves the funeral pyre informs Rama that he is Danu and a curse had turned him in a demon, who was manipulated by Malyavan – Ravana's chief adviser – to create havoc in the region. He expresses his gratitude to Rama and cautions him that Malyavan has also set Vali against him.|$|E
5|$|The hoot is a short, soft {{call and}} is {{another form of}} contact call. It is a more {{intimate}} call than the wail and is used exclusively between small family groups or flocks. The common loon hoots to let other family or flock members <b>know</b> <b>where</b> it is. This call is often heard when the adult loon is summoning its chicks to feed.|$|E

Both he and Jeremiah escape on a boat, leaving Scully alone with the seemingly dead Bounty Hunter. When she approaches the body, the Bounty Hunter wakes up and chokes her, demanding to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> Mulder and Smith are heading. He releases her after realizing she has no such knowledge.|$|E

He doesn't necessarily think he's got his friend back, but he thinks the matters are settled. From the look of Shane in that car, I don't know that he's necessarily thinking that. For the most part, this conflict may be put on the back burner for the time being. It definitely seems like Shane still has a bone to pick.|$|E
5|$|Design {{managers}} often {{operate in}} the area of design leadership; however, design management and design leadership are interdependent rather than interchangeable. Like management and leadership, they differ in their objectives, achievements of objectives, accomplishments, and outcomes. Design leadership leads from creation of a vision to changes, innovations, and implementation of creative solutions. It stimulates communication and collaboration through motivation, sets ambitions, and points out future directions to achieve long-term objectives. In contrast, design management is reactive and responds to a given business situation by using specific skills, tools, methods, and techniques. Design management requires design leadership to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> to go and design leadership requires design management to know how to get there.|$|E
