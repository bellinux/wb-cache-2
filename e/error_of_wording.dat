The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to explore the grammatical errors made by the students of SMKN 2 Tegallalang in practicing their English. The theory applied for this paper is Error Analysis, Perspectives on Second Language Acquisition (1974) edited by Jack C. Richards. The data of the analysis of this paper are taken from the compositions by the students of SMKN 2 Tegallalang. Then the errors were collected and classified based on the types <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> according to the theory applied. The finding shows that they made some errors when they made a sentence. Actually they seem to be clever to use English in writing grammatically, however they are lack of knowledge as seen in the errors encountered in their statement. The error found can be classified into <b>error</b> <b>of</b> using singular-plural, <b>error</b> <b>of</b> using <b>word</b> form, <b>error</b> <b>of</b> using <b>word</b> choice, <b>error</b> <b>of</b> using verb tense, <b>error</b> <b>of</b> using add <b>word,</b> <b>error</b> <b>of</b> omit <b>word,</b> <b>error</b> <b>of</b> using <b>word</b> order, <b>error</b> <b>of</b> spelling, <b>error</b> <b>of</b> using punctuation, <b>error</b> <b>of</b> using article, <b>error</b> <b>of</b> meaning not clear, <b>error</b> <b>of</b> run on sentence...|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} to identify the Problem <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> using Chinese <b>words</b> (in Chinese 'cuobiezi'). Its relevance with students' language competence is clear. In China, researches deal with simplified characters. (in Chinese 'jiantizi') and the contributions aims for “standardisation of words”. This paper deals with <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> using original characters (in Chinese 'fantizi') of junior secondary students. The multiple methods have been employed to investigate {{the relationship between the}} frequency <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> and the language competence of students. The results showed that (1) the frequency <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> using Chinese <b>words</b> reflects the language competence of students; and (2) different reasons attribute to the <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> Chinese <b>words.</b> This paper finally suggests that we should (1) change the 'word count' method in marking Chinese compositions; (2) collect the <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> using Chinese words; (3) encourage students to enlarge their vocabulary and to use more words in their compositions; (4) teach 'ci' instead of 'zi'. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

The experiment is carried out on the log of user queries written in Thai. We first discuss the nature of Thai queries that makes the problem of finding related queries much more challenging. Not only are the queries short and ambiguous, the ambiguity <b>of</b> <b>word</b> boundary and ill-written queries also make the fundamental process of Thai text processing like word segmentation problematical. To cope with these problems, we propose the use of results from search engines to expand and enrich the meanings of queries.

40|$|Spontaneous speech {{samples from}} 10 Swedish {{children}} were collected and analyzed grammatically. The subjects consisted of 5 children with SLI and 5 MLU matched controls with normal grammatical development. The children with SLI differed {{significantly from the}} controls in their more restricted usage <b>of</b> <b>word</b> order patterns and in number <b>of</b> grammatical <b>errors.</b> As in studies on English-speaking children with SLI, the Swedish children with SLI had {{a large number of}} omissions of grammatical morphemes. Verb-related errors were more common than noun-related errors. Contrary to reports on children with SLI acquiring other languages, however, word order errors were also very common in the Swedish children with SLI. A restricted usage <b>of</b> <b>word</b> order patterns in combination with <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>word</b> order indicates that not only morphological deficits but also syntactic difficulties can be found in children with SLI relative to MLU controls, depending on the target language.

40|$|Abstract. The {{motivation}} {{of this work}} comes from the need of a Thai web corpus for testing our information retrieval algorithm. Two collections of news web documents are gathered from two different Thai newspaper web sites. Our goal {{is to find a}} simple yet effective method to extract news articles from these web collections. We explore the use of machine learning methods to distinguish article pages from non-article pages, e. g. table of contents, advertisements. Then, the selected web articles are compared in a fine-grained manner in order to find informative structures. Both steps of information extraction utilize the structural features of web documents rather than the extracted keywords or terms. Thus, the inherent <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>word</b> segmentation, one <b>of</b> the major problems in Thai text processing, do not affect to this method. ...|$|R

The Tabulatur dealt with three matters: (1) The kinds of poems and the parts of a meistergesang; (2) permissible rhymes; (3) mistakes to be avoided, including <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> delivery, of melody, of structure and of opinion and, especially, <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> rhyme, <b>word</b> choice, or meter.

40|$|Selected {{spontaneous}} <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>word</b> choice {{made between}} the ages of about 2 and 5 by 2 children whose language development has been followed longitudinally were analyzed for clues to semantic development. The errors involved the children's occasional replacement of a contextually required word by a semantically similar word after weeks or months <b>of</b> using both <b>words</b> appropriately. Because the errors were not present from the beginning and because correct usage prevailed most of the time, the errors cannot be explained by existing accounts of semantic development, which ascribe children's word-choice errors to initial linguistic immaturity. A plausible alternative account likens the errors to adult "slips of the tongue" in which the speaker, in the process of constructing a sentence to express a given meaning, chooses incorrectly among competing semantically related words. Interpreted in this way, the errors indicate that the process <b>of</b> drawing <b>words</b> into structured semantic systems based on shared meaning components begins much earlier than experimental studies have suggested. They also provide evidence for certain differences between children and adults in the planning and monitoring of speech...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} error {{analysis}} on the errors made by grade 9 students of SMP Cita Hati, Surabaya, in constructing sentences by using restrictive adjective clauses. This study {{would like to know}} the types <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> the students made in constructing sentences by using restrictive adjective clause and the sources <b>of</b> the <b>errors.</b> This study was based on Larry Selinker’s theory about interlanguage. Interlanguage is a language which is produced by L 2 learners while learning L 2. Interlanguage can’t be considered as L 2 because its structures are different from L 2 grammatical structures. The subjects of this study are the grade 9 students of SMP Cita Hati, Surabaya. In order to collect the students’ errors in constructing sentences by using restrictive adjective clauses, the writer used a test that ask the students to construct sentences by using restrictive adjective clauses as the instrument of this study. The test, then, was administered to the students. From the data collected, the writer examined the data then classified the errors found into 6 types <b>of</b> <b>errors.</b> They were <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> relative pronouns (11. 78 % <b>of</b> total answers), <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> subjects (0. 7 % <b>of</b> total answers), <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> objects (3. 57 % <b>of</b> total answers), <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>word</b> order (3. 1 % <b>of</b> total answers), <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> prepositions (1. 55 % of total answers) and miscellaneous <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> adjective clauses (12. 13 % of total answers). The total errors were 276 <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> 840 answers or 32. 83 % of total answers. After conducting error classification, the writer predicted some possible sources <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> proposed by Larry Selinker. The writer predicted the sources based on his observation toward the teacher who was teaching restrictive adjective clauses and the students. The possible sources <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> which were predicted as the causes <b>of</b> the students’ <b>errors</b> were language transfer, transfer of training and strategy of second language learning. After predicting some possible sources <b>of</b> the <b>errors,</b> the writer suggested some ways to help the students to learn grammar especially about restrictive adjective clauses...|$|R
30|$|Two {{circumstances}} can {{be treated}} as <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> manual <b>word</b> segmentation; firstly, if a ridiculous segment appears in segmentation results, it {{can be treated}} as an error (type I error); and secondly, if an indivisible segment is divided in segmentation results, {{it can also be}} treated as an error (type II error). These two circumstances are not compatible with our general word intuition even to the least extent because they are simply incomprehensible, and they cannot be explained by variations <b>of</b> <b>word</b> intuition among speakers; normally, when the subjects do word segmentation tasks carefully according to their word intuition, these would not occur and thus we can treat them as errors. Human word segmentation errors will occur when the subjects try to cheat by segmenting randomly or make accidental mistakes.|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} {{number of studies have}} looked at the value of corpus-based data-driven learning (DDL) for second language (L 2) written error correction, with generally positive results. However, a potential conundrum for language teachers involved in the process is how to provide feedback on students’ written production for DDL. The study looks at DDL-mediated error correction across 61 written samples submitted by 32 tertiary students during a series of short DDL courses. Teachers provided feedback on errors present in the samples, and students highlighted corrections made with or without the corpus. The results suggest that students used corpora to correct <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>word</b> choice, word form, collocations and phrasing, but were less likely to use corpora to correct <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> deletion or morphosyntax. When the corpus was used, students were likely to successfully correct <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> collocation but were less successful for <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> morphosyntax. Post-course questionnaires suggested that perception of the usefulness of DDL for grammar learning was less than that for vocabulary and the learning of phrases, and that time and effort spent on analyzing concordance data and understanding the teacher 2 ̆ 7 s feedback on their writing were perceived as difficulties. To explore these findings further, a qualitative analysis of the feedback teachers provided suggests significant difficulties devising appropriate feedback that promotes autonomous, inductive language acquisition for all error types on the one hand, {{and at the same time}} does not eliminate the need for corpus consultation nor is too vague for students to formulate appropriate corpus queries. This study is therefore an initial yet important step in identifying the type <b>of</b> <b>errors</b> that teachers can address in a timely manner with focused feedback leading to corpus consultation, and how such feedback affects the success of this consultation...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the Minimum Exact Word Error (exactMWE) {{training}} criterion to optimise {{the parameters of}} large scale speech recognition systems. The exactMWE criterion {{is similar to the}} Minimum Word Error (MWE) criterion but uses the exact <b>word</b> <b>error</b> instead <b>of</b> an approximation based on time alignments as used in the MWE criterion. It is shown that the exact word error for all word sequence hypotheses can be represented on a word lattice. This can be accomplished using transducer-based methods.

Therefore, to be able to construct wh-question correctly {{is one of the}} important points in learning English. Realizing the fact that the third year students of Stella Maris Junior High School students still had difficulties in constructing correct "Wh-question" arose the writer's curiosity in finding out the most troublesome element of wh-question pattern made by the students. The writer then set up two kinds of instruments to be tested to the students. After the students did the test, the writer collected the work and analyzed the errors encountered. The writer classified the errors based on the elements in wh-question. They are <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> wh-word, <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> auxiliary, <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> subject, <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> verb and <b>errors</b> <b>of</b> <b>word</b> order. The writer divided those errors into sub errors types. For the sub error types, the missuse of wh-word occupied the highest number, followed by the omission of auxiliary and the missuse of verb. However, the most troublesome was the auxiliary. The <b>error</b> <b>of</b> auxiliary was the most troublesome element for the third year students of Stella Maris Junior High School in constructing wh-question. This brings six possible reasons. First, the students were familiar with certain types of wh-questions. Second, the students were not aware of the existence, the usage and the order of auxiliaries in wh-questions. Third, the students did not pay attention to the possessive and subjective personal pronoun of the subjects. Fourth, the students did not realize that the verb form in wh-question must be infinitive without to, except when the wh-question ask for the subject of the statement. Fifth, the students were not aware of the order <b>of</b> the <b>words</b> in constructing wh-questions especially when it comes to subject. Sixth, the students had not mastered the pattern of wh-question well. Based on the findings, she concluded that the most difficult element in constructing wh-question for the third year students of Stella Maris Junior High School is auxiliary. The findings of this study are expected to be used by the English teachers as one of the sources to improve the effectiveness and the techniques of their teaching. about wh-question. Hence, the teacher can help the students minimize their errors.

In this paper, we investigate the problem <b>of</b> <b>word</b> ordering <b>errors</b> in Chinese sentences and propose classifiers to detect this type <b>of</b> <b>errors.</b> <b>Word</b> n-gram features in Google Chinese Web 5 -gram corpus and ClueWeb 09 corpus, and POS features in the Chinese POStagged ClueWeb 09 corpus are adopted in the classifiers. The experimental results show that integrating syntactic features, web corpus features and perturbation features are useful for word ordering error detection, and the proposed classifier achieves 71. 64 % accuracy in the experimental datasets. 協 助 非 中 文 母 語 學 習 者 偵 測 中 文 句 子 語 序 錯...|$|R
