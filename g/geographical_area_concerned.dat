40|$|The present work proposes an {{operational}} {{tool for the}} integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) planning. Our approach {{is based on a}} participative action research. We consider that the implementation and development of an Information System to support knowledge integration and sharing in policy actions, will operate on three different aspects: technical aspect (by giving a “physical” access to the knowledge), a cognitive role (to facilitate the understanding by the different stakeholders) and an organizational function (because such a system can enhance the awareness, and the appropriation by the stakeholders). The methodology proposed consist in several stages from the definition of the limits of the <b>geographical</b> <b>area</b> <b>concerned</b> (the territory), to a systematic identification of the marine resources and the associated uses. A framework for the assessment of economical and ecological impacts of the marine uses is defined on the basis of territorial indicators...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims to {{highlight}} {{the presence of a}} large and varied production of contemporary Italian travel writing and to analyse the reasons for its 'invisibility' in the Italian literary system and critical tradition. Through the use of a comparative approach to genre and of current theories developed in the area of Translation Studies, the thesis will outline the different status attributed to travel writing in the Anglo-American and the Italian literary systems. Such a comparative approach allows the study to escape the narrow confines of a perspective based on the idea of national literature and to adopt a wider view, which, in turn, highlights the presence of phenomena otherwise easily overlooked or discarded as insignificant. The peculiar characteristics of travel writing, a genre mostly based on the representation of the Other for a home audience, are also analysed in order to point out their affinity with translation practices and, ultimately, to underline the 'double translation' implied by translated travel writing. The case studies which make up the remaining part of the thesis are intended to illustrate different aspects of the genre of travel writing; to provide scope for an analysis of its boundaries and connections with other genres (ranging from ethnography to autobiography, from journalism to fiction, from the essay to the novel); and to illustrate the way in which generic expectations influence both the selection of texts for translation and the strategies adopted when translating and marketing them for a new audience. The writings of twentieth-century Italian explorers to Tibet, and their translations into English, constitute a significant case of adaptation of foreign texts to the needs and expectations of a British audience (and to the British interests in the <b>geographical</b> <b>area</b> <b>concerned).</b> The works of Oriana Fallaci and their different reception in Italy with respect to the UK and the USA illustrate the way in which personal biography and generic choices can intersect, determining both the popular image and the critical success of an author and of her work. Calvino's choice to sublimate the genre of travel writing in the stylized fiction of Le citta invisibili is treated {{as an example of the}} way in which a text which is meant to provide an escape from a low-status genre can become an icon of that same genre once it is translated and read in a different cultural context. Finally, the case of Claudio Magris's Danubio and of its English-language translation provides evidence of the complex network of literary references which marks the reception of a text in different cultures, and of the way in which generic affiliation can both promote the recognition of a 'marginal' text and constrain its more idiosyncratic (and original) characteristics...|$|E

40|$|Traditional police boundaries—precincts, patrol districts, etc. —often fail {{to reflect}} the true {{distribution}} of criminal activity and thus do little {{to assist in the}} optimal allocation of police resources. This paper introduces methods for crime incident forecasting by focusing upon <b>geographical</b> <b>areas</b> of <b>concern</b> that transcend traditional policing boundaries. The computerised procedure utilises a geographical crime incidence-scanning algorithm to identify clusters with relatively high levels of crime (hot spots). These clusters provide sufficient data for training artificial neural networks (ANNs) capable of modelling trends within them. The approach to ANN specification and estimation is enhanced by application of a novel and noteworthy approach, the Gamma test (GT) ...|$|R
40|$|In total, 36 litters were {{recorded}} in Scandinavia during the summer 2007 of which 0 in Finland, 24 inSweden and 15 in Norway. In 2001 and 2004, when the small rodent cycle {{was in the same}} increasephase as this year, we had 9 and 28 litters recorded in Scandinavia, respectively, which means thatthe population has increased strongly during the last six years. However, the population increase hasnot been similar all over Scandinavia. In the southern mountain areas, Helagsfjällen and Borgafjäll,the actions of feeding and red fox removal have been very efficient. The number of litters in theseareas has doubled between each rodent increase year. The Norwegian part of Børgefjell has acted asa control area where no actions have been implemented. There, the number of litters has remainedconstant in increase years during the project period 2001 - 2007. In the northern mountain areas,Vindelfjällen and areas in Norrbotten, we have not managed to keep a high intensity of actions. Thenumber of litters in these areas has been stable. The reasons for the large variation in extent ofimplemented actions between the mountain areas are mainly logistical problems due to the extent ofthe <b>geographical</b> <b>areas</b> <b>concerned</b> in combination with harsh winter climate. In the northern areas,due to the geographical distances, field workers would have to stay in the field for several days inorder to perform field actions which can be achieved in a single day in the southern mountain areas...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} safety hazards faced by child pedestrians at rural schools within the Waipa District. The main objectives {{of this research}} were to identify hazards child pedestrians face, to identify current counter-measures to these hazards, and to evaluate the regulations and policies pertaining to these counter-measures and child pedestrian safety. Meeting these objectives then allowed the design of possible counter-measures to the hazards faced by rural child pedestrians. The ultimate goal {{of this research was}} to improve child pedestrian safety at rural schools. To achieve these goals and objectives, case studies were selected. The Waipa District was selected as a case study of a particular <b>geographical</b> <b>area</b> with <b>concerns</b> about pedestrian safety. Within this district Hautapu School was selected as an in-depth study into the specific concerns about child pedestrian safety at rural schools. Various methodologies were applied to obtain specific information from the varying sources. These methodologies and sources included: interviews with key informers, analysis of regulations and policy, a parental survey and a classroom discussion with school children who face the particular hazards.

40|$|The present paper {{explains}} and {{employs a}} new method {{for creating a}} graph that sets up a time frame for the corsair raids of the North African powers on the Spanish coasts in the 17 th and 18 th centuries and especially between 1650 and 1768. This method {{is based on the}} analysis of the information found in the record books kept by the redemptionist orders—the Trinitarians and the Mercedarians. Nearly 10, 000 cases have been examined and it can be hypothesized that the assumption of a decrease in the corsair raids during the 18 th century does not seem to hold water, as far as this precise <b>geographical</b> <b>area</b> is <b>concerned.</b> Furthermore, and using the same sources, it is claimed that a geo-history of these corsair raids makes it possible to find out the areas that were most affected by these attacks as well as their evolution over time. This study sheds new light on the question of captivity, which is not only the fallout of privateering but also of the border wars between the Spanish Empire and the North African powers...|$|R
50|$|However, {{researchers}} at thinks tanks {{such as the}} Overseas Development Institute argue the risks are outweighed by the benefits and that {{what is needed is}} careful regulation. For instance, there is a risk that private providers will ‘skim off’ the most profitable clients and cease to serve certain unprofitable groups of consumers or <b>geographical</b> <b>areas.</b> Yet such <b>concerns</b> could be addressed through regulation and by a universal service obligations in contracts, or in the licensing, to prevent such a situation from occurring. Of course, this bears the risk that this barrier to entry will dissuade international competitors from entering the market (see Deregulation). Examples of such an approach include South Africa's Financial Sector Charter or Indian nurses who promoted the nursing profession within India itself, which has resulted in a rapid growth in demand for nursing education and a related supply response.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} influence of place of residence and diabetic patient's socioeconomic position on their use of health services in a universal health care system. This retrospective cross-sectional population-based study {{is based on the}} joint use of the Health Insurance information systems, an ecological indicator of social deprivation and an indicator of potential spatial accessibility of healthcare provision in the Midi-Pyrénées region. Using French healthcare insurance population-based data on reimbursement of out-of-hospital care during the year 2012, we study the use of health services among patients aged 50 and over (n = 90, 136). We built logistic regression models linking health services use to socioeconomic position by geographic area, adjusted for age, gender, healthcare provision, information regarding patients precariousness, and long-term condition, used as proxy for the state of health. After adjustment for healthcare provision, the lower population density in the <b>geographical</b> <b>area</b> of <b>concern,</b> the lower the access to specialised care, independent of the patients' SEP. General practitioner attendance was higher among the patients with the lowest SEP without being clearly influenced by their living place. We found no clear influence of either patients' SEP or their living place on their access to biological follow-up. This study is an attempt to account for the geographical context and to go further in studying the social determinants of health among diabetes patients...|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} to be able readily to identify major routes of exposure, the most highly exposed individuals or populations and the <b>geographical</b> <b>areas</b> of most <b>concern</b> arising from radioactive contamination. The critical group approach is used to identify sub-sections of the population who are likely to be most exposed. In this paper, the concept of radioecological sensitivity is explored with particular reference to methods of identifying spatial variation in radiation exposure. Radioecological sensitivity analysis attempts to integrate current knowledge on pathways, spatially attribute the underlying processes determining transfer and thereby identify the most radioecologically sensitive areas leading to high radiation exposure. This identifies where high exposure may occur and why, not only for humans, but also for other biota. It can consider single food products or species, or a number of key parameters to identify areas where a number of key pathways coincide. An example of radioecological sensitivity analysis is given for the Arctic. Prior identification of such areas and exposed individuals should improve the focus of emergency preparedness and planning, and contribute to environmental impact assessment for future facilities...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim was to}} {{identify}} <b>geographical</b> <b>areas</b> of <b>concern</b> {{in the process of}} catchment delineation in urban areas in geographic information systems, GIS. The aim was also to develop a new method for the delineation in order to address identified problems. The calculations of the catchment areas are important for subsequent hydraulic modeling, which is performed in order to properly design storm water systems capable of handling the storm water. An object oriented method was developed that took into account the identified, problematic factors in the infrastructure and buildings of the urban area. An alternative algorithm for the preprocessing of the digital elevation model, DEM, was tested to see how the results would differ from a current method for catchment delineation with another algorithm for the preprocessing of the DEM. The two different algorithms for DEM preprocessing were used before the same procedure of catchment delineation was performed on the DEMs in ArcGIS. The delineated catchments from the two different preprocessing algorithms along with the object oriented method, were evaluated against reference catchment areas manually plotted by hydraulic modeling specialists. The object oriented method showed a higher correlation to the reference than the topographic methods for the most important target parameters when performing well. However the object oriented method has to improve in precision and efficiency {{if it is to be}} used for the calculations. The catchment delineation methods with different DEM preprocessing algorithms yields different results. For the DEM preprocessing, an algorithm from Whitebox GAT seemed to performed better in flat areas and in areas where the storm water lines have been lowered into the DEM, than the ArcGIS method did. However the combination of Whitebox GAT and ArcGIS resulted in some problems with the catchment delineation and hence the combined method has to be refined in order to be used...|$|R

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{illustrates the}} results of a research project focused on the creation of an atlas of the ???architectural project for existing buildings???. This inventory aims to present itself as a rational and critical analytical instrument, allowing an overall vision of the various, current philosophical-practical approaches, adopted throughout different <b>geographical</b> <b>areas</b> and <b>concerning</b> projects of rehabilitation and adaptive reuse of historic buildings, through an extensive mapping of case studies, selected from over two hundred projects realised over the last 15 years. This atlas is not, however, merely an instrument of knowledge, but, above all, an opportunity to rethinking of the idea of intervention on the existing building, emphasizing the need to combine the readability and comprehensibility of the building in its historical evidence to the reality and the redefinition of its functional characteristics, with the purpose of an renewed use, with particular attention to his issues of habitable space. For this reason, the Atlas offers a critical reading of the innovative projects that reveal the presence of arrays of recurrent conceptual attitudes identified as "design actions". These actions put highlights in convergent and founding mode, as well as complementary attitudes, sometimes even antithetical, present in the process of the social, cultural and economic buildings revitalizing. These actions are: - ???approach???, an act that implies an awareness of the relation between the original body of the building and its new complementary and/or defining elements; - ???addition??? that reveals a reciprocal need for physical contact that, albeit abolishing the principle of independence, preserves the explicit reading of the added elements, describing the building as a whole generated by the co-presence of original and new portions; - ???insertion??? that is the one most intrinsically connected to internal design, because everything is realised inside the volume of the pre-existing architecture, according to the principle of inclusion. - ???superimposition??? that represents the most intense moment of comparison between the characteristics of the pre-existing building and its reconfiguration through a design voluntarily oriented towards an act of over-writing...|$|R
