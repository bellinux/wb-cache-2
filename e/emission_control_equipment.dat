40|$|Regulators {{have been}} {{concerned}} {{with the impact of}} environmental regulation on the profitability of regulated firms: there have been numerous grants and subsidy programs to reduce the cost of <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> <b>equipment.</b> Intuitively, there should be a monotonically increasing relationship between profits and the amount of subsidization. However, the author shows that this may not be so since regulation may establish a collusive outcome amongst oligopolistic competitors.

The focus is on 1975 and 1979 - 1981, when new standards took effect that led directly to the adoption of costly new <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> <b>equipment.</b> The costs were significant during those time periods — with almost all automakers installing new oxidation catalyst technology in the first time period and three-way catalytic converters in the second. However, prices of new vehicles did not appear to reflect the full costs of emissions control. Other cost and pricing considerations seemed to be even more important. The added compliance costs associated with emissions reduction were just one more factor used by companies in setting prices.

40|$|AbstractPortugal {{is one of}} the {{countries}} facing the problem of carbon costs due to the insufficient preparation to achieve its commitments for the Kyoto Protocol and the EU Burden–Sharing Agreement. With the use (and dependency) on fossil fuels in our present quality of life, and the need of the continuous technological development, the CO 2 levels will still continue to grow. It is, therefore, urgent to take some measures in order to stagnate and even more, to diminish the emissions of this phenomenon to the atmosphere. This study shows the implementation of CO 2 capture as a possibility for CO 2 reductions in the electricity sector in Portugal.

40|$|In this chapter, {{we present}} the {{estimated}} costs and economic impacts associated with {{implementation of the}} proposed ATCM for stationary engines. The expected capital and recurring costs for potential compliance options are presented, {{as well as an}} analysis of the cost effectiveness of the ATCM. The cost effectiveness is calculated two ways, as the cost in dollars per pound of diesel PM reduced and also as the cost in dollars per pound of combined ROG + NOx reduced. The costs and associated economic impacts are presented for private companies, as well as governmental agencies. A. Summary of the Economic Impacts ARB staff estimates the cost of the ATCM to affected businesses and government agencies to be approximately 47 million dollars for the total capital costs. This corresponds to 8. 4 million dollars annually over the useful lift of the control equipment.

The proposed replacement system would be based upon modern design criteria and safety analyses. The replacement AHF supply and distribution system equipment would be located on the existing Dock 8 / 8 A at Building 9212. Utilities would be extended to the dock to service the process equipment. The following process equipment modules would be prefabricated for installation at the modified dock: an AHF cylinder enclosure, an AHF supply manifold and vaporizer module, an AHF sump tank and transfer skid, and an AHF supply off-gas scrubber assembly module. The fluidized-bed reactor system would be constructed in an area adjacent to the existing system in Building 9212.

40|$|We {{report on}} {{long-term}} remote sensing measurements of {{light duty vehicle}} emissions at one site close to Zurich/Switzerland. The time series of annual measurements at the same site between 2000 and 2012, the same season, and virtually the same instrument is unique, probably worldwide. We analyze the development of unit exhaust emissions from model years 1985 until 2012, covering all five Euro emission limit stages in force. NOx emissions from both diesel cars and light commercial vehicles have actually increased in real-driving over time although emission limits have been progressively tightened. This behavior is explained mostly by a significant discrepancy between engine conditions during real-driving and the homologation test procedure. This discrepancy is not important for the other pollutants or for gasoline light duty vehicles, for which the <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> <b>equipment</b> is found working {{over a wide range}} of engine conditions. Our results confirm emission factors from the latest HBEFA model when deterioration and engine load are accounted for. Recent remote sensing measurements of diesel cars and light commercial vehicles in London are at the same or higher levels. However, given that engine load is much lower in London, this coincidence is rather puzzling. A key uncertainty is the amount of primary NO 2 in the exhaust, and potential systematic differences between dominant brands in European countries. Both needs further investigation...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The first {{objective}} of this thesis is to assess NETPLAN effectiveness as a new planning tool for meeting the requirements of power system planning. The second objective is extension of NETLAN {{so that it can}} analyze the impact of existing and proposed EPA regulations on generation portfolios during the next 40 years. In {{the first half of the}} thesis, NEPLAN, NEMS (DOE), and ReEDs (NREL) are introduced. Comparisons among the three models include model design, solution approach, energy and transportation systems elements, objective function, and constraints in the Linear Programming problem. Based on the model comparison, the strengths and weaknesses of NETPLAN, NEMS (DOE), and ReEDs (NREL) are discussed. NETPLAN is assessed as an effective new tool for power system planning due to its uniqueness in multi-sector, multi-objective design. In the second half of the thesis, NETPLAN is improved to enable analysis of impact of proposed environmental regulations. Compliance strategies include establishing new power plants with low emission rates, retrofitting with <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> <b>equipment,</b> modified dispatch strategies, fuel switching, and earlier retirement. A multi-level and multi-arc design approach is applied to model power plants retrofitted with emission-control equipment. Scenarios are developed for examining the impact of existing and proposed environmental regulations. NETPLAN results are compared with research results from NEMS (DOE), ReEDS (NREL), and NERC. The case study results demonstrate an increased need for using natural gas and renewable energy resources to meet environmental regulations...|$|E
40|$|The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) has an {{in-house}} modification of EPA's PART 5 model {{for use in}} estimating respirable particulate matter (PM- 10) from vehicle exhaust. The update is named PART 5 -TX 1 and this paper describes the new model. To create PART 5 -TX 1, the PART 5 model was modified to incorporate the effects of <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> <b>equipment</b> deterioration for most types of vehicles. Relative to PART 5, the revised model provides an improved estimate of "in-use " emissions because only emissions data from "in-use " vehicles were used to develop its predictive equations. The database used for PART 5 -TX 1 is of chassis dynamometer data from over 600 light-duty cars and trucks and over 400 heavy-duty trucks and buses. The database is set up such {{that it can be}} easily updated and incorporated into the model as new in-use data are collected. Only direct exhaust emission factors were changed in PART 5 -TX 1. No attempt was made to change assumptions about secondary particulate formation, brake or tire wear, and dirt re-entrainment. In general, PART 5 -TX 1 predicts higher fleet-average emissions than EPA's PART 5. Other differences between PART 5 and PART 5 -TX 1 include: · updated particle size distribution estimates; · the ability to estimate the effect of fuel sulfur level; · estimates for the effects of a simple, opacity-based inspection and maintenance program for diesels or a "smoking vehicle " program for gasoline vehicles; and, · updated heavy-duty diesel vehicle conversion factors, vehicle registration distributions, and mileage accumulations (all from MOBILE 6) ...|$|E
40|$|Particulate removal devices operate {{basically}} on {{the principle}} that a gas stream contain-ing particles is passed through a region where the particles are acted on by external forces or caused to intercept obstacles, thereby separating them from the gas stream. When acted upon by external forces, the particles acquire a velocity component in a direction {{different from that of the}} gas stream. In order to design a separation device based on particulate separation by external forces, one must be able to compute the motion of a particle under such circumstances. A preliminary selection of suitable particulate emission control systems is gener-ally based on knowledge of four items: particulate concentration in the stream to be cleaned, the size distribution of the particles to be removed, the gas flow rate, and the final allowable particulate emission rate. Once the systems that are capable of providing the required efficiencies at the given flow rates have been chosen, the ultimate selection is generally made on the basis of the total cost of construction and operation. The size of a collector, and therefore its cost, is directly proportional to the volumetric flow rate of gas that must be cleaned. The operating factors that influence the cost of a device are the pressure drop through the unit, the power required, and the quantity of liquid needed (if a wet scrubbing system). In this chapter we concentrate on the design equations that are generally used for calculating efficiencies of various types of particulate <b>emission</b> <b>control</b> <b>equipment.</b> We shall not consider the estimation of capital or operating costs. Devices that remove particles from gas streams rely on one or more of the follow-ing physical mechanisms: 1. Sedimentation. The particle-containing gas stream is introduced into a device or chamber where the particles settle under gravity to the floor of the chamber. De-vices of this type are called settling chambers...|$|E
