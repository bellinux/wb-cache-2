These changes affect the size of Transient, <b>Holdee</b> and Student account (THS). The current Officer Basic Course changes to a two-phased system called Basic Officer Leadership Course (BOLC II and III). A twenty-week Captains' Career Course (CCC) replaces the current CCC and Combined Arms and Service Staff School (CAS 3). Currently, Command and General Staff College (CGSC), where 50 % of a year group attends resident CGSC, shifts to a two-phased approach with a Common Core Course and a Career Field Qualification Course. This thesis includes an Excel simulation model producing monthly predictions for six years for officers in THS account because of schooling. Assignments are Permanent Change of Station (PCS), Temporary Duty (TDY) Enroute, or TDY and Return. Therefore, if 30 % of majors attend Officer Education System (OES) as a PCS or TDY Enroute, the THS account sees a man-year increase of between 166 and 552 personnel. For CCC, if 30 % of captains attend CCC as PCS/TDY Enroute, THS shows a man-year decrease of between 1162 and 1171. When the new BOLC education system was simulated, the THS account showed a man-year increase of between 172 and 242 {{when compared to the}} current OBC.
