40|$|Environmental {{regulation}} {{of oil in}} salt water disposal from oil and gas operations are becoming more stringent and the high value of crude oil makes recovery of any residual oil in the produced water attractive. Most of the current methods used for recovery are older designs and not very efficient, so {{a new and more}} efficient system would be useful in the industry. A test was performed using a coalescing media test system at a disposal well site in West Texas and the oil removal efficiency was very good- enough to suggest the commercial value of a large separation system. A full size system was designed and constructed using a <b>frac</b> <b>tank</b> as the basic structure and utilized coalescing media to perform the separation. The following paper will include information on the initial testing, design of the system, and field operations and performance. Keywords...|$|E
