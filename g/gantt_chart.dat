25|$|Many {{new project}} {{management}} techniques were introduced {{during the development}} of the Polaris missile program, to deal with the inherent system complexity. This includes the use of the Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT). This technique replaced the simpler <b>Gantt</b> <b>chart</b> methodology which was largely employed prior to this program.|$|E
25|$|Event chain {{diagrams}} are visualizations {{that show}} the relationships between events and tasks and how the events affect each other. The simplest way to represent these chains is to depict them as arrows associated with certain tasks or time intervals on the <b>Gantt</b> <b>chart.</b> Different events and event chains can be displayed using different colors. Events can be global (for all tasks in the project) and local (for a particular task). By using event chain diagrams to visualize events and event chains, the modeling and analysis of risks and uncertainties can be significantly simplified.|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} aimed at <b>Gantt</b> <b>charts.</b> Primarily on their use in {{production}} processes, such as planning and scheduling. The thesis also includes an introduction, explaining what are the <b>Gantt</b> <b>charts,</b> for what are using and what is their principle. The thesis also includes analysis and software possibilities for implementing <b>Gantt</b> <b>charts</b> with using OOP. Programmatic and theoretical analysis of the various functions that are characteristic of <b>Gantt</b> <b>charts,</b> including their internal logic and program implementation. These programmed characteristic functions of <b>Gantt</b> <b>charts</b> were composed {{in the form of}} a DLL library, which provides a simple implementation of <b>Gantt</b> <b>charts.</b> By using this library is realized the software for production management. The work is included on the DVD, except the DLL itself software with detailed descriptions of each part of the source code...|$|R

The <b>Gantt</b> <b>charts</b> are assembled by Current based on tasks the user defines as {{being part of a}} project. The tasks are assigned to persons using a scrollable list and linked to a project through a database relationship. While less sophisticated and less graphically interesting than <b>Gantt</b> <b>charts</b> produced by modern software, the output was coherent and usable.|$|R
25|$|As a discipline, project {{management}} developed from several fields of application including civil construction, engineering, and heavy defense activity. Two forefathers of {{project management}} are Henry Gantt, called {{the father of}} planning and control techniques, who is famous for {{his use of the}} <b>Gantt</b> <b>chart</b> as a project management tool (alternatively Harmonogram first proposed by Karol Adamiecki); and Henri Fayol for his creation of the five management functions that form the foundation of the body of knowledge associated with project and program management. Both Gantt and Fayol were students of Frederick Winslow Taylor's theories of scientific management. His work is the forerunner to modern project management tools including work breakdown structure (WBS) and resource allocation.|$|E
2500|$|Taylor is also {{credited}} {{for developing}} stopwatch time study, this combined with Frank and Lillian Gilbreth motion study {{gave way to}} {{time and motion study}} which is centered on the concepts of standard method and standard time. Frank Gilbreth is also responsible for introducing the flow process chart in 1921. Other contemporaries of Taylor worth remembering are Morris Cooke (rural electrification in the 1920s and implementer of Taylor's principles of scientific management in the Philadelphia's Department of Public Works), Carl Barth (speed-and-feed-calculating slide rules [...] ) and Henry Gantt (<b>Gantt</b> <b>chart).</b> Also in 1910 Hugo Diemer published the first industrial engineering book: Factory Organization and Administration.|$|E
50|$|Various charts {{are used}} to help schedulers {{visually}} manage schedules and constraints. The <b>Gantt</b> <b>chart</b> is a display that shows activities on a horizontal bar graph in which the bars represent {{the time of the}} activity. Below {{is an example of a}} <b>Gantt</b> <b>chart</b> for the process in the example described above.Another time chart which is also sometimes called a <b>Gantt</b> <b>chart</b> shows the time during which key resources, e.g. equipment, are occupied. The previous figures show this occupancy-style <b>Gantt</b> <b>chart.</b>|$|E
