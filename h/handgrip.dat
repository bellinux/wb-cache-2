2500|$|The ADE 651 {{consists}} of a swivelling antenna mounted via a hinge to a plastic <b>handgrip.</b> It requires no battery or other power source; its manufacturer claimed that it is powered solely by the user's static electricity. To use the device, the operator must walk {{for a few moments}} to [...] "charge" [...] it before holding it at right angles to the body. After a substance-specific [...] "programmed substance detection card" [...] is inserted, the device is supposed to swivel in the user's hand to point its antenna {{in the direction of the}} target substance. The cards are claimed to be designed to [...] "tune into" [...] the [...] "frequency" [...] of a particular explosive or other substance named on the card. According to Husam Muhammad, an Iraqi police officer and user of the ADE 651, using the device properly is more of an art than a science: [...] "If we are tense, the device doesn't work correctly. I start slow, and relax my body, and I try to clear my mind." [...] The cards were supposedly [...] "programmed" [...] or [...] "activated" [...] by being placed in a jar for a week along with a sample of the target substance to absorb the substance's [...] "vapours". Initially, McCormick reportedly used his own blood to [...] "program" [...] the cards for detecting human tissue, but eventually gave up even the pretense of [...] "programming" [...] them when demand for the devices was at its peak.|$|E

6000|$|This {{characteristic}} scene, {{which has}} delayed me over-long, {{was but a}} moment in that day of exercise and agitation. To fit out a schooner for sea and improvise a marriage, between dawn and dusk, involves heroic effort. All day Jim and I ran and tramped, and laughed and came near crying, and fell in sudden anxious consultations, and were sped (with a prepared sarcasm on our lips) to some fallacious milliner, and made dashes to the schooner and John Smith's, and at every second corner were reminded (by our own huge posters) of our desperate estate. Between-whiles I had found the time to hover at some half a dozen jewellers' windows; and my present, thus intemperately chosen, was graciously accepted. I believe, indeed, {{that was the last}} (though not the least) of my concerns, before the old minister, shabby and benign, was routed from his house and led to the office like a performing poodle; and there, in the growing dusk, under the cold glitter of Thirteen Star, two hundred strong, and beside the garish glories of the agricultural engine, Mamie and Jim were made one. The scene was incongruous, but the business pretty, whimsical, and affecting; the typewriters with such kindly faces and fine posies, Madame so demure, and Jim--how shall I describe that poor, transfigured Jim? He began by taking the minister aside {{to the far end of}} the office. I knew not what he said, but I have reason to believe he was protesting his unfitness, for he wept as he said it; and the old minister, himself genuinely moved, was heard to console and encourage him, and at one time to use this expression: [...] "I assure you, Mr. Pinkerton, that there are not many who can say so much"--from which I gathered that my friend had tempered his self-accusations with at least one legitimate boast. From this ghostly counselling, Jim turned to me; and though he never got beyond the explosive utterance of my name and one fierce <b>handgrip,</b> communicated some of his own emotion, like a charge of electricity, to his best man. We stood up to the ceremony at last, in a general and kindly discomposure. Jim was all abroad; and the divine himself betrayed his sympathy in voice and demeanour, and concluded with a fatherly allocution, in which he congratulated Mamie (calling her [...] "my dear") upon the fortune of an excellent husband, and protested he had rarely married a more interesting couple. At this stage, like a glory descending, there was handed in, ex machinâ, the card of Douglas B. Longhurst, with congratulations and four dozen Perrier-Jouet. A bottle was opened, and the minister pledged the bride, and the bridesmaids simpered and tasted, and I made a speech with airy bacchanalianism, glass in hand, But poor Jim must leave the wine untasted. [...] "Don't touch it," [...] I had found the opportunity to whisper; [...] "in your state it will make you as drunk as a fiddler." [...] And Jim had wrung my hand with a [...] "God bless you, Loudon!--saved me again!" ...|$|E

40|$|Aim: In {{the present}} study the {{response}} of optic nerve head blood flow {{to an increase in}} ocular perfusion pressure during isometric exercise was studied. Based on our previous studies we hypothesized that subjects with an abnormal blood flow response, defined as a decrease in blood flow of more than 10 % during or after isometric exercise, could be identified. Methods: A total of 40 healthy subjects were included in this study. Three periods of isometric exercise were scheduled, each consisting of 2 minutes of <b>handgripping.</b> Optic nerve head blood flow was measured continuously before, during and after <b>handgripping</b> using laser Doppler flowmetry. Blood pressure was measured non-invasively in one-minute intervals. Intraocular pressure was measured at {{the beginning and the end}} of the measurements and ocular perfusion pressure was calculated as 2 / 3 *mean arterial pressure –intraocular pressure. Results: Isometric exercise was associated with an increase in ocular perfusion pressure during all <b>handgripping</b> periods (p < 0. 001). By contrast no change in optic nerve head blood flow was seen. However, in a subgroup of three subjects blood flow showed a consistent decrease of more than 10 % during isometric exercise although their blood pressure values increased. In addition, three other subjects showed a consistent decline of blood flow of more than 10 % during the recovery periods...|$|R

40|$|We {{previously}} {{demonstrated a}} bimodal distribution of forearm vasodilator responsiveness to adenosine (ADO) infusion in the brachial arteries of human subjects. We also demonstrated that ADO receptor antagonism blunted exercise hyperaemia during heavy rhythmic <b>handgripping,</b> but vasodilator responses to exogenous ADO were only blunted in ADO responders. In this study, we continued investigating {{the contribution of}} ADO to exercise hyperaemia and possible differences between responders and non-responders. We hypothesized that ADO transporter antagonism would increase vasodilatation in response to exogenous ADO in responders only, but not effect exercise-mediated vasodilation. To test this hypothesis, we compared forearm vascular conductance (FVC) during infusion of ADO to FVC during <b>handgripping</b> before and after infusion of dipyridamole (DIP) in 20 subjects. In ADO responders, change in FVC above baseline (ml min− 1 (100 mmHg) − 1) for low, medium and high doses of ADO, respectively, was 58 ± 8, 121 ± 22 and 184 ± 38, and after DIP was 192 ± 32, 238 ± 50 and 310 ± 79. For non-responders, these values were 23 ± 2, 43 ± 5 and 66 ± 9, respectively, before DIP (P 0. 20). We found that ADO transporter blockade {{had no effect on}} exercise hyperaemia in either subgroup. We conclude that there may be increased ADO transporter activity in non-responders resulting in reduced ADO-mediated vasodilatation. The failure of DIP to augment exercise hyperemia under these conditions suggests that ADO concentrations may not rise enough during rhythmic <b>handgripping</b> to {{have a major impact on}} these responses...|$|R

Our data confirm previous results indicating that optic nerve head blood flow is autoregulated during an increase in perfusion pressure. In addition, we observed a subgroup of 6 subjects (15 %) that showed an abnormal response, which is in keeping with our previous data. The mechanisms underlying this abnormal response remain to be shown...|$|R
