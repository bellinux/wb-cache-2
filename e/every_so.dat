Lake Vostok, discovered beneath Russia's Vostok Station in 1996, is the largest of these subglacial lakes. It was once believed that the lake had been sealed off for 500,000 to one million years but a recent survey suggests that, <b>every</b> <b>so</b> often, there are large flows of water from one lake to another.|$|E

5|$|<b>Every</b> <b>so</b> often, {{the player}} {{will come to}} a point where he or she is given the chance to choose from {{multiple}} options. The time between these points is variable and can occur anywhere from a minute to much longer. Gameplay pauses at these points and depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress in a specific direction. There are four main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. The plot lines carry on from each other in a linear fashion. The game can end prematurely if the player makes the wrong decisions. When this occurs, the player must go back to a previously saved spot and choose different decisions.|$|E

5|$|Matthews was {{appointed}} general manager at Stoke's rivals Port Vale in July 1965, alongside good friend Jackie Mudie; Matthews was unpaid, though was given expenses. The pair {{had a plan}} of bringing through talented schoolboys and selling one or two off <b>every</b> <b>so</b> often to improve the club's bleak financial picture, whilst {{at the same time}} advancing through the leagues; in his autobiography he said that what Dario Gradi later achieved at Crewe Alexandra is what he had in mind for the Vale. Matthews concentrated his search in North East England and Central Scotland, where he discovered talented striker Mick Cullerton, though overlooked a teenage Ray Kennedy.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the early}} stories were {{completed}} in one issue, but multi-part stories began to appear {{by the middle of}} the series' first year of publication, and there were hints of the ongoing storylines that would later characterize the series. In May 1983, issue #11 introduced many new characters, including most of the 1983 action figure line and the villain Destro, who would become a frequently recurring character. Many subsequent storylines involved the machinations and power struggles between him, Cobra Commander, and the Baroness. Issue #11 established a pattern for the series in which <b>every</b> <b>so</b> often Marvel would publish an issue introducing a group of characters and vehicles that represented the new year's toy offerings.|$|E

He saves the team many times and does know some Japanese but rarely speaks it. He carries Browning Hi-Power and LAR Grizzly handguns or a PP-19 Bizon submachine gun during missions.|$|E

5|$|The {{flight of}} the {{fieldfare}} is slow and direct. It takes several strong beats then closes its wings briefly before flapping on. It is highly gregarious, quite shy and easily scared {{in the winter and}} bold and noisy in the breeding season. When a group is in a tree they all tend to face in the same direction, keeping up a constant chatter. When foraging on the ground, often in association with redwings, the group works its way up wind, each bird pausing <b>every</b> <b>so</b> often to stand erect and gaze around before resuming feeding. When alarmed they fly off down wind and the feeding group reforms elsewhere. In woodland they do not skulk in the undergrowth as do blackbirds or song thrushes, instead they perch in the open on bushes and high branches. They roost socially, sometimes in overgrown hedges and shrubberies but usually on the ground. Common sites are in rough grass among bushes or clumps of rushes, in young plantations, on stubble and in the furrows of ploughed fields.|$|E
5|$|There are six main plot {{lines that}} the player {{will have the}} chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. <b>Every</b> <b>so</b> often, the player will come to a point where he or she is given the chance to choose from {{multiple}} options. Text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. Each scenario is divided into eight episodes, one interlude episode and an epilogue. At the end of an episode, an announcement of the next episode appears showing a preview of what is to consist in the next episode. Each episode takes place within the span of one month between June and March from episode one through the epilogue. The interlude episode is placed between the second and third episodes.|$|E
5|$|As {{they return}} to the human world, Yusuke is {{stripped}} of his detective title as King Enma orders he be captured and executed in fear that Yusuke's demon blood could cause him {{to go on a}} rampage in the human world. Yusuke, unsettled at having been controlled by his ancestor Raizen, accepts an offer by Raizen's followers to return to the Demon Plane. Raizen, desiring a successor to his territory, is on the brink of dying of starvation, a death that would topple the delicate political balance of the three ruling powers of the Demon Plane. Hiei and Kurama are summoned by the other two rulers, Mukuro and Yomi, respectively, to prepare for an inevitable war. The three protagonists train in the realm for one year, during which time Raizen dies and Yusuke inherits his territory. Yusuke takes initiative and proposes a fighting tournament to name the true ruler of the Demon Plane, which is agreed upon by Mukuro and Yomi. During the tournament, Yusuke and Yomi meet in the second elimination round where Yusuke is defeated and knocked unconscious. Yusuke awakens days later to find that the tournament has ended and that a similar competition is to be held <b>every</b> <b>so</b> often to determine the Demon Plane's ruler. Yusuke stays in the Demon Plane for a while longer, but eventually returns to the human world after several years to be with Keiko.|$|E

25|$|Accidents {{and lasting}} damage can {{generally}} {{be avoided by}} very simple security precautions and a rudimentary knowledge of the human anatomy. One very simple safety measure is to ask the subject <b>every</b> <b>so</b> often {{if he or she}} is all right. Another is to check body parts like hands and feet for numbness or coldness, which can happen if nerves have been pinched or blood circulation has been blocked. Another is to check for skin discoloration. Skin that does not get enough oxygen turns bluish. If blood can get in, but cannot get out because one of the veins has been blocked, that part of the body turns purple.|$|E

The two males will clash wings and spiral vertically upwards engaging in an aerial contest for the territory.|$|E

25|$|The most {{significant}} matches {{during the early}} part of Sabu's career in ECW by defeating Terry Funk to win the ECW World Heavyweight Championship and the ECW World Television Championship in a title versus title dream partner tag team match. Also, he was a part in the three way dance for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship at The Night the Line Was Crossed, against Terry Funk and Shane Douglas, which went to a one-hour time limit draw and his tag team feud with The Public Enemy in which Sabu and his partner The Tazmaniac captured the ECW World Tag Team Championship in a double tables match. Another notable event occurred in April 1995 when, after being scheduled for a three-way dance for the ECW World Tag Team title, Sabu no–showed the event to accept a booking in Japan for New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW), which led Paul Heyman to publicly and legitimately fire Sabu at the event. Sabu stated in the Forever Hardcore documentary that he had a career wrestling in Japan yet only wrestled once <b>every</b> <b>so</b> often for ECW; thus, he chose Japan over ECW.|$|E
