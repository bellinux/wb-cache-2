The differences in what scores mean with regard to percentiles are due {{to the content of}} the exam and the caliber of students choosing to take each exam. Subject Tests are subject to intensive study (often {{in the form of an}} AP, which is relatively more difficult), and only those who <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> perform well tend to take these tests, creating a skewed distribution of scores.|$|E
