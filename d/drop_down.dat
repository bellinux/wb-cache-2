5|$|The type of pastry used is not defined, {{as long as}} it {{is golden}} in colour and will not crack during the cooking or cooling, {{although}} modern pasties almost always use a shortcrust pastry. There is a humorous belief that the pastry on a good pasty should be strong enough to withstand a <b>drop</b> <b>down</b> a mine shaft, and indeed the barley flour that was usually used does make hard dense pastry.|$|E
5|$|Magna Carta Holy Grail debuted {{at number}} one on the Billboard 200 and sold 528,000 copies in its first week, which {{bypassed}} its predicted debut in the range of 350,000 to 400,000. The album also debuted at {{number one on}} the Canadian Albums Chart. It is Jay-Z's third straight number one album in Canada. The album debuted at {{number one on the}} UK Album Chart, Jay-Z's first UK number one album. In its second week the album sold 129,000 more copies in the United States. Despite the 76% drop in sales, Magna Carta Holy Grail retained its number one position on the Billboard 200, becoming the first rap album to spend two consecutive weeks on top since Lil Wayne's Tha Carter IV (2011). In its third week the album would <b>drop</b> <b>down</b> to number two, selling 77,000 copies. In its fourth week the album would <b>drop</b> <b>down</b> to number three, selling 62,000 copies. It sold 1,099,000 copies in 2013 in the United States, making it the tenth best-selling album of the year. By February 26, 2014, the album had sold 1,130,000 copies in the United States. As of September 2, 2013, It was announced by Billboard that Magna Carta Holy Grail was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipments of two million copies in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Ronny Deila's first {{competitive}} {{match in}} charge of Celtic was a Champions League qualifying tie away against KR Reykjavik on 15 July 2014, which ended in a 1–0 win with midfielder Callum McGregor scoring the decisive goal on 84 minutes. Celtic eased to a 4–0 win in the return match in Scotland, but were comprehensively beaten and outplayed in the next qualifying round, losing 6–1 on aggregate to Legia Warsaw. Despite this, Celtic were given a reprieve when {{it was discovered that}} Legia had fielded an ineligible player in the second leg, Bartosz Bereszynski coming on as a substitute in the last four minutes. UEFA punished the Polish club by awarding the game a 3–0 to Celtic, levelling the aggregate score at 4–4 and seeing the Scottish champions progress on away goals. Despite this astonishing piece of luck, Celtic failed abjectly to take advantage in the final qualifier against Maribor, losing 2–1 on aggregate to <b>drop</b> <b>down</b> to the Europa League.|$|E
5|$|If {{conditions}} are normal {{and a green}} light is shown, the athlete's coach – who is situated in a coaches' section lower down the inrun with a flag in hand – gives them the final signal to go; coaches may sometimes have to whistle or give a shouted confirmation in low-visibility conditions. Once given this signal, the athlete must commit to their jump within ten seconds or else risk disqualification: {{they are not allowed}} to exit the gate from whence they came. To begin descending the inrun, they <b>drop</b> <b>down</b> from the gate to a crouching position. Speed is rapidly picked up within seconds via built-in tracks, made from porcelain or ceramic, into which the skis are slotted. The athlete's streamlined crouch minimises air resistance along the inrun, and a further effort is made to reduce friction by not allowing the skis (which have wax applied to them) to bump too much against the sides of the tracks. Speed is measured from the table using a speed gun.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Midland Alliance's 20-year existence, the Regional League has {{accepted}} and, after the Midland League was re-formed, continues to accept applications for membership from successful teams in smaller local leagues within its catchment area. Leagues whose clubs {{have joined the}} Regional League include the Shropshire County League, the Herefordshire League, the Wolverhampton Combination, and the Kidderminster & District League. Several ambitious local Sunday league teams have also switched to Saturday play and entered the league. Bewdley Town, Bromyard Town and Ellesmere Rangers have all joined from county leagues since 1994 and subsequently gone on to gain promotion to the Premier Division. Regional League teams could also theoretically be relegated to the local leagues but in practice this almost never happens. The only teams in recent history to <b>drop</b> <b>down</b> to a county league have been Leominster Town, Kington Town and Hinton, who dropped down to the Herefordshire League in 2004, 2006 and 2007 respectively, although all three clubs resigned voluntarily in favour of playing in a more local league {{as opposed to being}} relegated due to finishing {{at the bottom of the}} table.|$|E

5|$|Turning {{into the}} wide sweep of St Ives Bay, where many walkers <b>drop</b> <b>down</b> onto the sands at low tide, the path follows {{the line of}} the sand dunes or Towans as they are known here. This area was used for {{explosives}} manufacture for many years, the sand being ideal for absorbing any accidental explosions. The Towans are interrupted by two rivers, the small Red River at the north end, and the larger River Hayle and its estuary towards the south. Although narrow, the estuary is tidal and fast flowing due to the large expanse of mud flats and docks that lie behind the Towans, so the path turns away from St Ives Bay to go round via Hayle. The water is crossed using an old railway bridge and then the old Hayle Railway is followed into the town centre then the A30 road to Griggs Quay where quieter roads bring the Path around to {{the west side of the}} tidal mud flats. Views of the birdlife can be had from Carnsew Pool at Hayle and from the area around Lelant Saltings railway station, although the official path is slightly inland on the A3074 road through Lelant village, regaining the coast by crossing golf links to reach the last of the Towans above Porth Kidney Sands.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{the album}} debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 84,000 album-equivalent {{units in the}} week ending March 24, {{according}} to Nielsen Music. In addition, This Is What the Truth Feels Like was also the best-selling album of the week, ranking number 1 on Billboards Top Album Sales chart, with pure album sales of 76,000 copies (90% of overall units). It became Stefani's first number 1 and third top five album as a solo artist. The only time she previously reached the top was with her band No Doubt with their third record Tragic Kingdom (1995). With this feat, she became the fifth woman to first reach number 1 {{as part of a}} band or group, and then later earn their own solo leader. However, it also marked the lowest first week sales for one of her albums, with Love. Angel. Music. Baby. and The Sweet Escape selling 309,000 copies and 243,000 copies in their first weeks, respectively. With the release Stefani peaked at number 4 on the Billboard Artist 100 chart, up approximately 557% from her previous peak of 53, the chart's fourth-highest jump ever. The following week, Billboard reported that the album dropped 16 places on the Billboard 200, with sales decreasing 78% to 17,700 copies. For the next five weeks, the album continued to <b>drop</b> <b>down</b> the charts. In its seventh week, it jumped from number 82 to number 59, the same week she appeared on The Late Late Show with James Corden. The record was on the chart for 13 weeks; its final position for the week ending August 6, 2016, was number 114. On May 27, 2016, This Is What the Truth Feels Like was made available on vinyl exclusively at Barnes & Noble in the United States; after its release, it debuted and peaked at number 23 on the Vinyl Albums component chart.|$|E
