5|$|Olga Tufnell (26 January 1905 – 11 April 1985) was a British {{archaeologist}} who assisted on {{the excavation}} {{of the ancient}} city of Lachish in the 1930s. She had no <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> <b>in</b> archaeology, but {{had worked as a}} secretary for Flinders Petrie {{for a number of years}} before being given a field assignment. Olga then went on to join James Leslie Starkey in the expedition to find Lachish in 1929 and remained part of the team for the following seasons.|$|E
5|$|Allen had {{initially}} intended to study {{to become a}} minister, but after his father became too ill to work, he instead went into teaching. He {{became a member of}} Fruitful Vale All-Age's teaching staff at age 17. Two years later, and following the death of his father, Allen went to Moneague Teachers' College to receive <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> <b>in</b> teaching. He became a teacher at an All-Age school in Saint Mary Parish after graduation. Between 1979 and 1983, Allen served as the principal at a succession of schools; Robins Bay All-Age School, Hillside Primary School, and finally Port Maria High School.|$|E
5|$|The melody of {{the song}} is a memorable tune made easy to learn because of its {{combination}} of harmonic repetition and contrast—elements that make music easy to remember while avoiding monotony. The recurrence and dissimilarity within the melody {{is similar to the}} patterns in many popular folk songs. Dresser, however, avoided the common 19th-century practice of using a portion of the refrain's melody in the verse. With little <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> <b>in</b> music theory, it is unlikely that Dresser purposefully made any methodical calculations when he composed the melody.|$|E

5|$|Between 1913 and 1916, Gerhard Heilmann {{published}} {{a series of}} articles in the journal of the Danish Ornithological Society, all heavily illustrated and dealing with the question of the origin of birds. He first proposed the idea of a popular treatise on bird evolution in 1912 to Otto Helms, the editor of the journal of the Danish Ornithological Society. Helms supported the idea but recommended that Heilmann first seek professional advice on the topic. Despite the lack of <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> <b>in</b> zoology, Heilmann succeeded in amassing his research with the help of several others, including the expert in prehistoric animals at the Zoological Museum in Copenhagen, Adolf Herluf Winge, and the biologist D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson of the University of Dundee. Winge, though initially showing interest in Heilmann's work, later proved {{to be a source of}} frustration by refusing to engage Heilmann in depth on various scientific queries. Heilmann eventually broke off contact, expressing some bitterness at the apparent change of heart, which Heilmann later ascribed to Winge's belief in Lamarckism.|$|E
5|$|There was {{no system}} at Port Chicago for making sure {{officers}} {{and men were}} familiar with safety regulations. Two formal lectures and several informal lectures {{were given to the}} enlisted men by commanding officers, but follow-up confirmation of retained knowledge did not take place. Safety regulations were posted at a single location at the pier but not within each of the barracksKinne did not think the enlisted men would be able to comprehend such a list. The International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) responded to word of unsafe practices by offering to bring in experienced men to train the battalion but Navy leadership declined the offer, fearing higher costs, slower pace, and possible sabotage from civilian longshoremen. No enlisted man stationed at Port Chicago had ever received <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> <b>in</b> the handling and loading of explosives into ships. Even the officers did not receive training: Lieutenant Commander Alexander Holman, loading officer at Port Chicago whose duties included officer training, had initiated a search for training materials and samples but failed to organize a training class before disaster struck.|$|E

25|$|As {{a mother}} and a writer who criticized experts in the male-dominated field of urban planning, Jacobs endured scorn from {{established}} figures. She did not have a college degree or any <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> <b>in</b> urban planning, and her lack of such credentials was seized upon as grounds for criticism by some.|$|E
25|$|Hanson {{was able}} to give a number of {{recitals}} of his own compositions in the late 1930s, and had the opportunity to gain some <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> <b>in</b> composition after being awarded the Gordon Vickers Scholarship at the New South Wales State Conservatorium of Music. Unfortunately, his Conservatorium studies would last only two months before the war interrupted them.|$|E
25|$|It was {{for this}} reason that Rolfe never {{undertook}} any <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> <b>in</b> either painting or photography. His paintings and designs, including several for the covers of his own books, were bold and surprisingly accomplished amateur efforts. He executed some of the most impressive of them when he was living in Christchurch in 1890 and 1891, including a small but striking oil painting of St Michael.|$|E

25|$|Cromwell had no <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> <b>in</b> {{military}} tactics, {{and followed}} the common practice of ranging his cavalry in three ranks and pressing forward, relying on impact rather than firepower. His strengths were an instinctive ability to lead and train his men, and his moral authority. In a war fought mostly by amateurs, these strengths were significant {{and are likely to}} have contributed to the discipline of his cavalry.|$|E
25|$|Edmund Blampied (30 March 1886– 26 August 1966) {{was one of}} {{the most}} eminent artists to come from the Channel Islands, yet he {{received}} no <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> <b>in</b> art until he was 16 years old. He was noted mostly for his etchings and drypoints published at the height of the print boom in the 1920s during the etching revival, but was also a lithographer, caricaturist, cartoonist, book illustrator and artist in oils, watercolours, silhouettes and bronze.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, a 10-month-old Newfoundland named Boo saved a hearing-impaired {{man from}} {{drowning}} in the Yuba River in Northern California. The man {{fell into the}} river while dredging for gold. Boo noticed the struggling man {{as he and his}} owner were walking along the river. The Newfoundland instinctively dove into the river, took the drowning man by the arm, and brought him to safety.

25|$|Just {{as quickly}} as he became popular, Rattenbury and his {{architecture}} was out of favour. Perhaps a symptom of his waning popularity, he lost the competition to build the Saskatchewan Legislative Building, built 1908–1912 in Regina, to E. and W.S. Maxwell, two Montreal architects trained at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. In contrast to the Maxwells, Rattenbury had no <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> <b>in</b> architecture and, with the increasing professionalism of the field, was soon outpaced by better-trained and better-educated architects.|$|E

25|$|D.D. Palmer's {{student and}} son, B.J. Palmer, assumed {{control of the}} Palmer School in 1906, and {{promoted}} professionalism and <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> <b>in</b> chiropractic, expanding enrollment to a peak of above 1,000 students in the early 1920s. Chiropractic leaders of the time often invoked religious imagery, and B.J. seriously considered declaring chiropractic a religion, deciding against this partly to avoid confusion with Christian Science. B.J. also worked to overcome chiropractic's initial resistance {{to the use of}} medical technology, by accepting diagnostic technology such as spinal X-rays (which he called spinography) in 1910.|$|E

25|$|As {{a fitness}} instructor, Smith found {{a lack of}} {{appealing}} clothes in which to work and started to sew her own. She had no <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> <b>in</b> garment production, but had been interested in fashion since a teenager, crocheting bikinis from age 16, customising her clothes from age 18, and from age 21 starting to design and make her own clothes. She began by unpicking a favourite swimsuit {{and used it to}} make a pattern out of newspaper, providing the basis for her first leotard design. Her students liked her outfits, and started requesting that Smith make clothes for them too.|$|E
25|$|Pepe Sánchez, born José Sánchez (18561918), {{is known}} as the father of the trova style and the creator of the Cuban bolero. He had no <b>formal</b> <b>training</b> <b>in</b> music. With {{remarkable}} natural talent, he composed numbers in his head and never wrote them down. As a result, most of these numbers are now lost for ever, though some two dozen or so survive because friends and disciples transcribed them. His first bolero, Tristezas, is still remembered today. He also created advertisement jingles before radio was born. He was the model and teacher for the great trovadores who followed him.|$|E
