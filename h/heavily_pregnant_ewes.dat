40|$|Because {{we became}} an {{unintended}} {{world leader in}} the development of multiple anthelmintic resistance, South Africa has had to find, embrace and implement more sustainable and holistic methods of managing helminths in sheep. The problem has been to wean farmers off a heavy reliance on anthelmintics and to use a wide array of measures that require more management, in the face of inertia and attempts by some unscrupulous drug purveyors to block the needed changes. Packaging the available and proven measures into five practical sections helps to make the change more palatable and attractive to farmers. These sections are termed “The Big Five” and consist of firstly, host resistance and resilience: in the past we have concentrated too much on anthelmintic resistance (AR) and not enough on SR (sheep resistance). The motto must be “Stop Selecting Sissy Sheep!” To achieve this we can apply selection of rams by faecal egg counts (FEC) or FAMACHA, culling of ewes based on targeted selective treatment (TST) results, good nutrition, especially protein and trace elements needed to support immunity, enough exposure to worms for immunity to develop, and control of other diseases. Secondly, reducing parasite load: since the outcome of parasitosis is largely determined by numbers, this needs ongoing attention. This can be achieved by reducing the length of stay in a pasture, reducing the grazing pressure if this is not possible, increasing the time of absence from a pasture, especially at danger times, alternation with non-susceptible grazing species where possible, avoiding worm “hot spots” like grassed pens and leaking water troughs. Thirdly, evaluate pasture factors: the farmer and advisor have to consider the height (length) of grazing as it affects its risk for parasite transfer, the type (pasture species) as it will influence risk, the pasture slope affecting run-off and thus the suitability for larval survival, and the aspect (direction facing) should also be used to assess risk. Fourth, monitoring the situation: farm situations can be assessed by regular (monthly or bimonthly) pooled flock FECs, AR assessments using FEC reduction tests (FECRTs) or other measures, measures using TST like the 5 POINT CHECK, a weather watch to predict conditions favourable for larval development (rain, humidity, temperature) and grazing monitoring to assess developing dangers. Fifth, optimise drugs to be used: drug usage must be rationalised and minimised. Implement TST and TT (targeted treatment); read the label, follow instructions and check the spectrum covered; weigh the sheep, set dose according to the heaviest in the group and check the gun for accuracy and repeatability; target the most vulnerable (lambs and lactating or <b>heavily</b> <b>pregnant</b> <b>ewes)</b> for special attention; do not buy on cost alone and do not formulate (mix) own farm mixtures. By emphasising the “Big Five” we can encourage and enable farmers to implement four or more items in each section, and thus minimise the long-term effects of internal parasites on farm profitability. This approach has assisted with getting farmers to use sustainable, holistic internal parasite management (SHIPM) in sheep flocks. A reminder {{in the form of a}} poster to be hung on the wall of the farm office will help encourage continuous implementation. [URL]...|$|E

40|$|Myometrial {{activity}} and plasma progesterone (P) and oxytocin (OT) were measured in early pregnant (n = 5) and cycling (n = 5) ewes. Electromyograph (EMG) leads and jugular and inferior vena cava (IVC) catheters were surgically placed in ewes about I wk before data collection. When ewes returned to estrus, they were bred to either an intact or vasectomized ram. Continuous EMG data were collected, and blood {{samples were collected}} twice daily from day of estrus (Day 0) until Day 18.

40|$|During pregnancy, plasma ACTH and {{cortisol}} are chronically increased; {{this appears}} to occur through a reset of hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity. We have hypothesized that differences in mineralocorticoid receptor activity in pregnancy may alter feedback inhibition of the HPA axis. We tested the effect of MR antagonism in <b>pregnant</b> and nonpregnant <b>ewes</b> infused for 4 h with saline or the MR antagonist canrenoate. Pregnancy significantly increased plasma ACTH, cortisol, angiotensin II, and aldosterone. Infusion of canrenoate increased plasma ACTH, cortisol, and aldosterone in both pregnant and nonpregnant ewes; however, the temporal pattern of these responses differed between these two reproductive states. In nonpregnant ewes, plasma ACTH and cortisol transiently increased at 1 h of infusion, whereas in <b>pregnant</b> <b>ewes</b> the levels gradually increased and were significantly elevated from 2 to 4 h of infusion. MR blockade increased plasma aldosterone from 2 to 4 h in the <b>pregnant</b> <b>ewes</b> but only at 4 h in the nonpregnant <b>ewes.</b> In both <b>pregnant</b> and nonpregnant <b>ewes,</b> the increase in plasma aldosterone {{was significantly related to}} the timing and magnitude of the increase in plasma potassium. The results indicate a differential effect of MR activity in <b>pregnant</b> and nonpregnant <b>ewes</b> and suggest that the slow changes in ACTH, cortisol, and aldosterone are likely to be related to blockade of MR effects in the kidney rather than to effects of MR blockade in hippocampus or hypothalamus...|$|R
40|$|A 2 ha 6 -year {{trial on}} pure stands of {{irrigated}} Grasslands Roa tall fescue compared {{the effect of}} high (600 - 300 kg N/ba/yr as urea) and moderate (300 - 150) nitrogen rates split over either 2 - or 4 - weekly application, on hay production, some summer grazing and autumn regrowth prior to winter and fed to <b>pregnant</b> <b>ewes</b> on the same plots. Annual yields averaged 13. 8 t DM/ba with a 24 % advantage to high N. <b>Pregnant</b> <b>ewes</b> break fed a mixed allowance of hay and grass regrowth lost c. 2. 4 % body weight over a g-week winter period. There was thinning of the stands under high N and long summer regrowth period. It was considered better to forego some of the winter feed potential for some summer grazing, or a further hay cut, to maintain stand density...|$|R

Physiol. 40 (5) : 725 - 728. 1976. -This {{study was designed to}} determine what effect physical training has on heart rate and stroke volume responses to exercise stress and to determine if exercise al-tered the distribution of uterine blood flow. Measurements were made in ten <b>pregnant</b> <b>ewes</b> at rest and immediately following exercise on a treadmill. Five ewes underwent physi-cal training for 3 wk prior to measurement. An increase in heart rate with no change in stroke volume was observed following exercise in both trained and untrained ewes. Total uterine blood flow was not changed following exercise, but distribution was altered in favor of the placenta. Blood flow was evenly distributed within the placenta before and after exercise. The redistribution of flow to the placenta that occur...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of fetal ovarian follicles {{is a critical}} determinant of adult female reproductive competence. Prolonged exposure to environmental chemicals (ECs) can perturb this process with detrimental consequences for offspring. Here {{we report on the}} exposure of <b>pregnant</b> <b>ewes</b> to an environmental mixture of ECs derived from pastures fertilized with sewage sludge (biosolids) : a common global agricultural practice. Exposure of <b>pregnant</b> <b>ewes</b> to ECs over 80 day periods during early, mid or late gestation reduced the proportion of healthy early stage fetal follicles comprising the ovarian reserve. Mid and late gestation EC exposures had the most marked effects, disturbing maternal and fetal liver chemical profiles, masculinising fetal anogenital distance and greatly increasing the number of altered fetal ovarian genes and proteins. In conclusion, differential temporal sensitivity of the fetus and its ovaries to EC mixtures has implications for adult ovarian function following adverse exposures during pregnancy...|$|R
