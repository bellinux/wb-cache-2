5|$|The {{non-magnetic}} {{character of}} zinc and {{its lack of}} color in solution delayed discovery of its importance to biochemistry and nutrition. This changed in 1940 when carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme that scrubs carbon dioxide from blood, was shown to have zinc in its active site. The <b>digestive</b> <b>enzyme</b> carboxypeptidase became the second known zinc-containing enzyme in 1955.|$|E

Scully attempts to perform an autopsy on Lauren's body, only to find that it has liquified with only a skeleton remaining. Scully later discerns that the substance coating the body was a concentrated <b>digestive</b> <b>enzyme,</b> and that the remains are lacking in body fat.|$|E
5|$|Another pitfall trap form {{unrelated}} to the Sarraceniaceae family are the urns of bromeliad leaves that are formed when leaves are tightly packed together in a rosette, collecting water and trapping insects. Unlike Brocchinia reducta, which has been proven to produce at least one <b>digestive</b> <b>enzyme</b> and can therefore be considered carnivorous, the epiphytic Catopsis berteroniana has little evidence supporting the claims that it is carnivorous. It is able to attract and kill prey and the trichomes {{on the surface of}} the leaves can absorb nutrients, but so far no enzyme activity has been detected. It may be that this plant also relies on an internal food web for soft tissue digestion. The same could be said for Paepalanthus bromelioides, though it is a member of Eriocaulaceae and not a bromeliad. It also forms a central water reservoir that has adaptations to attract insects. It, like C. berteroniana, produces no digestive enzymes.|$|E
50|$|Exocrine {{pancreatic}} insufficiency (EPI) is {{the inability}} to properly digest food {{due to a lack}} of <b>digestive</b> <b>enzymes</b> made by the pancreas. EPI is found in humans afflicted with cystic fibrosis and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome. It is caused by a progressive loss of the pancreatic cells that make <b>digestive</b> <b>enzymes.</b> Chronic pancreatitis is the most common cause of EPI in humans. Loss of <b>digestive</b> <b>enzymes</b> leads to maldigestion and malabsorption of nutrients.|$|R
40|$|Abstract A primary {{function}} of the pancreas is to produce <b>digestive</b> <b>enzymes</b> that are delivered to the small intestine for the hydrolysis of complex nutrients. Much of our understand-ing of <b>digestive</b> <b>enzymes</b> comes from studies in animals. New technologies {{and the availability of}} the sequence of the hu-man genome allow for a critical review of older reports and assumptions based on animal studies. This report updates our understanding of human pancreatic <b>digestive</b> <b>enzymes</b> with a focus on new insights into the biology of human proteases, lipases and amylases...|$|R

5|$|Calcium ions may be {{complexed}} by proteins through binding the {{carboxyl groups}} of glutamic acid or aspartic acid residues; through interacting with phosphorylated serine, tyrosine, or threonine residues; or by being chelated by γ-carboxylated amino acid residues. Trypsin, a <b>digestive</b> <b>enzyme,</b> uses the first method; osteocalcin, a bone matrix protein, uses the third. Some other bone matrix proteins such as osteopontin and bone sialoprotein use both {{the first and}} the second. Direct activation of enzymes by binding calcium is common; some other enzymes are activated by noncovalent association with direct calcium-binding enzymes. Calcium also binds to the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane, anchoring proteins associated with the cell surface. As an example of the wide range of solubility of calcium compounds, monocalcium phosphate is very soluble in water, 85% of extracellular calcium is as dicalcium phosphate with a solubility of 2.0mM and the hydroxyapatite of bones in an organic matrix is tricalcium phosphate at 100µM.|$|E
25|$|The {{salivary glands}} in mammals are exocrine glands, glands with ducts, that produce saliva, which is {{composed}} of several components including amylase, a <b>digestive</b> <b>enzyme</b> that breaks down starch into maltose and glucose. In humans and some other mammals the secretion is alpha-amylase, also known as ptyalin.|$|E
25|$|Differentiation {{of cells}} of the {{pancreas}} proceeds through two different pathways, corresponding to the dual endocrine and exocrine functions of the pancreas. In progenitor {{cells of the}} exocrine pancreas, important molecules that induce differentiation include follistatin, fibroblast growth factors, and activation of the Notch receptor system. Development of the exocrine acini progresses through three successive stages. These are the predifferentiated, protodifferentiated, and differentiated stages, which correspond to undetectable, low, {{and high levels of}} <b>digestive</b> <b>enzyme</b> activity, respectively.|$|E
5000|$|Exocrine {{pancreatic}} dysfunction: Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency arises {{due to a}} lack of acinar {{cells that}} produce <b>digestive</b> <b>enzymes.</b> These are extensively depleted and replaced by fat. A lack of pancreatic <b>digestive</b> <b>enzymes</b> leaves patients unable to digest and absorb fat. However, pancreatic status may improve with age in some patients.|$|R

25|$|<b>Digestive</b> <b>enzyme</b> {{supplements}} may {{significantly reduce}} the amount of flatulence caused by some components of foods not being digested by the body and thereby promoting the action of microbes in the small and large intestines. It has been suggested that alpha-galactosidase enzymes, which can digest certain complex sugars, are effective in reducing the volume and frequency of flatus. The enzymes alpha-galactosidase, lactase, amylase, lipase, protease, cellulase, glucoamylase, invertase, malt diastase, pectinase, and bromelain are available, either individually or in combination blends, in commercial products.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{methods of}} opening the zona pellucida have the same success rate because the {{well-being}} of the embryo and/or blastomere may be impacted by the procedure used for the biopsy. Zona drilling with acid Tyrode's solution (ZD) was looked at in comparison to partial zona dissection (PZD) to determine which technique would lead to more successful pregnancies and have less of an effect on the embryo and/or blastomere. ZD uses a <b>digestive</b> <b>enzyme</b> like pronase which makes it a chemical drilling method. The chemicals used in ZD may have a damaging effect on the embryo. PZD uses a glass microneedle to cut the zona pellucida which makes it a mechanical dissection method that typically needs skilled hands to perform the procedure. In a study that included 71 couples, ZD was performed in 26 cycles from 19 couples and PZD was performed in 59 cycles from 52 couples. In the single cell analysis, there was a success rate of 87.5% in the PZD group and 85.4% in the ZD group. The maternal age, number of oocytes retrieved, fertilization rate, and other variables did not differ between the ZD and PZD groups. It was found that PZD led to a significantly higher rate of pregnancy (40.7% vs 15.4%), ongoing pregnancy (35.6% vs 11.5%), and implantation (18.1% vs 5.7%) than ZD. This suggests that using the mechanical method of PZD in blastomere biopsies for preimplantation genetic diagnosis may be more proficient than using the chemical method of ZD. The success of PZD over ZD could be attributed to the chemical agent in ZD having a harmful effect on the embryo and/or blastomere. Currently, zona drilling using a laser is the predominant method {{of opening the}} zona pellucida. Using a laser is an easier technique than using mechanical or chemical means. However, laser drilling could be harmful to the embryo and it is very expensive for in vitro fertilization laboratories to use especially when PGD is not a prevalent process as of modern times. PZD could be a viable alternative to these issues.|$|E
