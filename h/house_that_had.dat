5|$|Melbourne Castle was {{a medieval}} castle in Melbourne, Derbyshire. It {{was built on}} the site of an earlier royal manor <b>house</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> {{provided}} accommodation for noblemen hunting in a nearby royal park in the reign of King John. Construction of the castle was started in 1311 by Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, and continued until 1322, shortly before his execution, but the work was never fully completed.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte's {{paternal}} family {{belonged to}} the House of Hohenzollern, a royal <b>house</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> ruled the German state of Prussia since the seventeenth century. By {{the end of her}} first year, Charlotte's father had become Crown Prince as his father ascended to the Prussian throne as King Wilhelm I. Charlotte's mother, Vicky, was the eldest daughter of the British monarch Queen Victoria and her husband Albert, Prince Consort. Charlotte and her brother, Wilhelm, were the only grandchildren born in Albert's lifetime. He and Victoria visited their daughter and two grandchildren when Charlotte was two months old; Vicky and Frederick in turn brought Wilhelm and Charlotte on a visit to England in June 1861, six months before Albert's death.|$|E
5|$|Hess died on 17 August 1987 {{at the age}} of 93 in {{a summer}} <b>house</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> been set up in the prison garden as a reading room. He took an {{extension}} cord from one of the lamps, strung it over a window latch, and hanged himself. Death occurred by asphyxiation. A short note to his family, thanking them for all they had done, was found in his pocket. The Four Powers released a statement on 17 September ruling the death a suicide. Initially buried at a secret location to avoid media attention or demonstrations by Nazi sympathisers, Hess was re-interred in a family plot at Wunsiedel on 17 March 1988, and his wife was buried beside him when she died in 1995. Spandau Prison was demolished to prevent it from becoming a neo-Nazi shrine.|$|E

5|$|In May 1960, Isser Harel, {{director}} of Mossad (the Israeli intelligence agency), personally led the successful effort to capture Adolf Eichmann in Buenos Aires. He hoped {{to track down}} Mengele as well so he too could be brought to trial in Israel. Under interrogation, Eichmann provided the address of a boarding <b>house</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> {{been used as a}} safe house for Nazi fugitives. Surveillance of the house did not reveal Mengele or any members of his family, and the neighborhood postman said that although Mengele had recently been receiving letters there under his real name, he had since relocated, leaving no forwarding address. Harel's inquiries at a machine shop where Mengele had been part owner did not turn up any leads either, so he had to give up.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Opera is {{a company}} based in central London, {{resident}} at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Along with the English National Opera, {{it is one of}} the two principal opera companies in London. Founded in 1946 as the Covent Garden Opera Company, it was known by that title until 1968. It brought a long annual season and consistent management to a <b>house</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> previously hosted short seasons under a series of impresarios. Since its inception, it has shared the Royal Opera House with the dance company now known as The Royal Ballet.|$|E
5|$|The Selfe family {{landed at}} Sydney's Semi-circular Quay in January 1855, when Norman was 15 years old. One {{of the reasons}} they emigrated to the colony of New South Wales was to enable him and his brother Harry to {{undertake}} engineering apprenticeships without having to pay the heavy premium required by large firms in London. They initially resided in the nearby Rocks district in a small <b>house</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> previously been the first Sydney home of Mary Reibey, a former convict who became Australia's first businesswoman. Selfe's parents had high expectations of their children, particularly of Norman, whose ability in mathematics and draughtsmanship was apparent from a young age. The brothers earned a reputation for innovation during their youth, and were the first to construct a velocipede in the country.|$|E

5|$|Later on {{the evening}} of 7 August, she asked Bamber whether he had done it. He said no, but that a friend of his had, whom he named; the man was a plumber the family had used in the past. Bamber {{allegedly}} said he had told this friend how he could enter and leave the farmhouse undetected, and that one of his instructions had been for the friend to telephone him from the farm on one of the phones in the <b>house</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> a memory redial facility, so that if the police checked it, it would give him an alibi. Everything had gone as planned, he said, except that Nevill had put up a fight, and the friend had become angry and shot him seven times. The friend had allegedly told Sheila to lie down and shoot herself last, Bamber said. The friend then placed the Bible on her chest so she appeared to have killed herself in a religious frenzy. The children were shot in their sleep, he said. Mugford said Bamber claimed to have paid the friend Â£2,000.|$|E

The jail would see various additions throughout the next 70 years, including the construction of more cell blocks as well as a stand-alone power plant. By 1973, the jail employed 220 residents and housed both male and female offenders. The jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street. The original jail cell blocks were subsequently demolished in 1994. Only one building from the complex, as well as the Warden's House, still stands today.|$|E
500|$|Epsilon Kappa Theta ("EKT," [...] "Theta") at Dartmouth College {{was founded}} in January 1982 as the Epsilon Kappa colony of the Kappa Alpha Theta {{national}} sorority. [...] Epsilon Kappa was the 100th colony of the sorority. [...] The sorority initially met {{in a wide variety}} of locations, including the basement of the college president's house. [...] In 1984, the sorority moved into Brewster Hall, a College-owned <b>house</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> previously been used as an International House and later as temporary housing for the Alpha Chi Omega sorority. [...] In 1992, the sisters of the Epsilon Kappa chapter of Kappa Alpha Theta found the strict national rules and the primarily Christian religious readings and rituals of the organization to be antithetical to the spirit of feminism and inclusivity that the chapter desired. [...] The national organization was unhappy with the colony's decision to disobey their rules and their failure to follow the sorority's rituals. [...] On May 4, 1992, the Dartmouth chapter notified the Kappa Alpha Theta national organization of its unanimous vote to disaffiliate and become a local sorority. [...] The national organization revoked the charter of Epsilon Kappa. The Dartmouth women chose the new name Epsilon Kappa Theta. [...] The current Epsilon Kappa Theta residence is a Victorian house over 100 years old.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the influence of access to potable water and sewer services about the attention for acute diarrheal disease (ADD) in centers of Ministry of Health. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ecological study. The geographical unit of analysis was constituted by each of 25 regions of Peru. Information was obtained of the number of attentions reported of ADD in centers of Ministry of Health of each region for 2007. The information of population and the access to potable water and sewer services was obtained of 2007 population census. The attention rate by ADD was calculated in centers of Ministry of Health being registered in a multiple linear regression model with variables of access to potable water and sewer services. RESULTS: In the total population, the percentage of <b>housing</b> <b>that</b> do not <b>have</b> access to potable water (p= 0, 000), the percentage of <b>housing</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> potable water less than 6 hours/day (p= 0, 000), the percentage of <b>housing</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> potable water 6 - 12 hours/day (p= 0, 000) and the percentage of <b>housing</b> <b>that</b> do not <b>have</b> sewer services (p= 0, 000) constituted predictors of attentions for ADD (R 2 = 0. 408). In population under 5 years old, the percentage of <b>housing</b> <b>that</b> do not <b>have</b> access to potable water (p= 0, 000), the percentage of <b>housing</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> potable water less than 6 hours/day (p= 0, 000), the percentage of <b>housing</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> potable water 6 - 12 hours/day (p= 0, 000) and the percentage of <b>housing</b> <b>that</b> do not <b>have</b> sewer services (p= 0, 000) also constituted predictors of attentions for ADD (R 2 = 0, 251). CONCLUSIONS: The access to potable water and sewer services explain the 40, 8 % and 25, 1 % of attentions for ADD in centers of Ministry of Health for the total population and the population under 5 years old respectively...|$|R
