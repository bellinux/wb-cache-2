5|$|The Nemesis of Faith is an epistolary {{philosophical}} {{novel by}} James Anthony <b>Froude</b> published in 1849. Partly autobiographical, the novel depicts {{the causes and}} consequences of a young priest's crisis of faith. Like many of his contemporaries, <b>Froude</b> came to question his Christian faith in light of early nineteenth century developments in history, theology, and science. <b>Froude</b> was particularly influenced by the Catholic teachings of the Oxford Movement and by the new approach to religious scholarship developed by the German Higher Critics.|$|E
5|$|The {{novel was}} {{influenced}} by Goethe's Elective Affinities, which <b>Froude</b> later translated and published anonymously. <b>Froude</b> borrowed much of his novel's ending from Goethe, and also used the scientific metaphor underlying Goethe's novel to illustrate the relation of an individual to the church.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to {{reconcile}} with Oxford, <b>Froude</b> refused to allow republication of The Nemesis of Faith following its second edition, and in 1858 he formally repudiated the novel.|$|E

60|$|Political disquisitions of this kind, and prophecies {{after the}} event, are found all through Mr. <b>Froude's</b> book, and {{on almost every}} second page we come across aphorisms on the Irish character, on the teachings of Irish history and {{on the nature of}} England's mode of government. Some of them {{represent}} Mr. <b>Froude's</b> own views, others are entirely dramatic and introduced for the purpose of characterisation. We append some specimens. As epigrams they are not very felicitous, but they are interesting from some points of view.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, the Oxford Movement, {{headed by}} John Henry Newman {{as well as}} Froude's brother Richard Hurrell <b>Froude,</b> was attacking the Church's move towards {{liberalism}} and secularism, advocating instead {{a greater emphasis on}} Catholic doctrine. The Movement provided a serious challenge to Protestant beliefs, with Newman later converting to Roman Catholicism. Although <b>Froude</b> was devoted to Newman for several years, and maintained a sentimental affection for the man (which he expressed in his essays on Newman and the Oxford Movement), he ultimately repudiated his beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Behind the High Table is a {{portrait}} of Edward II; underneath is a longsword brought to the college in 1902 after being preserved for many years {{on one of the}} college's estates at Swainswick, near Bath. On either side are portraits of Sir Walter Raleigh and Joseph Butler. The other portraits around the hall include other prominent members of Oriel such as Matthew Arnold, Thomas Arnold, James Anthony <b>Froude,</b> John Keble, John Henry Newman, Richard Whately and John Robinson.|$|E
5|$|The 1840s were a {{turbulent}} decade in the Church of England. Following the earlier German Higher Critics, who {{argued for a}} historical approach to religious texts, David Strauss published Leben Jesu or The Life of Jesus, Critically Examined which argued that {{the events of the}} New Testament were not historical but rather mythical. In 1846 George Eliot published an English translation of Leben Jesu which became a source of religious doubts for <b>Froude</b> and many of his contemporaries. Critics have also identified Thomas Carlyle's novel Sartor Resartus and Spinoza as sources of Sutherland's doubts, and those of many of his contemporaries.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{this drama}} the pure {{essentials}} of dramatic writing are rarely blended.... The {{foundation for the}} stirring play is a pathetic episode given in <b>Froude's</b> Henry VIII....|$|R
6000|$|Matters now became clear. Mr. <b>Froude's</b> {{transcript}} and translation had omitted all {{the first}} long paragraph of the letter, which proved that de Quadra went to Windsor, to the Court, on September 6. Next, the passage about 'the third of THIS month' really runs 'I showed her much dissatisfaction about her marriage, in [on?] which {{on the third}} of LAST month [August] she had {{told me she was}} already resolved and that she assuredly meant to marry. Now she has coolly told me that she cannot make up her mind, and that she does not intend to marry.' (Mr. Gairdner's translation, 1898.) So the blot on the Queen's scutcheon as to her foreknowledge and too previous announcement of Amy's death disappears. But how did Mr. Gairdner, in 1886, using Mr. <b>Froude's</b> transcript of the original Spanish, fail to see that it contained no Arch Duke, and no 'third of the month'? Mr. <b>Froude's</b> transcript of the original Spanish, but not his translation thereof, was correct.* ...|$|R
6000|$|Next, from 1886 onwards, the Spanish Government {{published}} five {{volumes of}} the correspondence of Philip with his ambassadors at the English Court.* These papers Major Hume was to condense and edit for our official publication, the Spanish State Papers, in the series of the Master of the Rolls. But Major Hume found the papers in the Spanish official publication in a deplorably unedited state. Copyists and compositors 'seem {{to have had a}} free hand.' Major Hume therefore compared the printed Spanish texts, where he could, with Mr. <b>Froude's</b> transcripts of the same documents in the Museum, and the most important letter in this dark affair, in our Spanish Calendar, follows incorrectly Mr. <b>Froude's</b> transcript, NOT the original document, which is not printed in 'Documentos Ineditos.'** Thus, Major Hume's translation differs from Mr. <b>Froude's</b> translation, which, again, differs from Mr. Gairdner's translation of the original text as published by the Baron Kervyn de Lettenhove.*** ...|$|R
5|$|The nave and chancel {{are carried}} on five pairs of piers and the {{interior}} has a boarded wagon roof coloured in blue, crimson and gold which stretches the whole length of the church. At {{the time of the}} construction of the Bristol and Exeter Railway, William <b>Froude</b> – the engineer given responsibility for this section of the line by Isambard Kingdom Brunel – inserted iron stringers to prevent the walls from spreading as a result of vibrations from the trains. A screen runs across the whole width of the church.|$|E
5|$|The {{valve gear}} that was settled upon was a {{modified}} form of Caprotti valve gear, the novel rotary cam-driven British Caprotti valve gear developed by Heenan & <b>Froude</b> with poppet valves. This {{was based on}} Italian locomotive practice and allowed precise control of steam admission to the cylinders while improving exhaust flow and boiler draughting characteristics {{when compared to the}} more conventional Walschaerts and Stephenson valve gear. On paper this created a free-steaming, hard-working locomotive capable of hauling heavy loads over long distances but, in practice, fundamental design errors and undetected deviations from the drawings made during construction combined to prevent the locomotive from achieving its expected performance during British Railways ownership.|$|E
25|$|<b>Froude</b> {{had been}} a close {{personal}} friend {{as well as an}} intellectual disciple of Thomas Carlyle since 1861, and the two became even closer after the death of Carlyle's wife Jane Welsh on 21 April 1866. Reading Jane's diaries and letters, Carlyle was struck by her unhappiness and his own irritability and inconsideration for her, and he decided to atone by writing her a memorial. In 1871, Carlyle gave <b>Froude</b> this memorial along with a bundle of Jane's personal papers, to be published after Carlyle's death, if <b>Froude</b> so decided. Also, Carlyle appointed <b>Froude</b> one of his own literary executors, although he was (perhaps intentionally) ambiguous in his instructions.|$|E
50|$|The {{term was}} {{converted}} into non-dimensional terms {{and was given}} <b>Froude's</b> name {{in recognition of the}} work he did. In France, it is sometimes called Reech-Froude number after Ferdinand Reech.|$|R
60|$|To {{deepen the}} {{darkness}} and distress, the official, printed, Spanish Documentos Ineditos do not give this abstract of November 20 at all. Major Hume translates it in full, from Mr. <b>Froude's</b> transcript.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Froude's</b> {{mission was}} thus {{ultimately}} considered unsuccessful and caused considerable uproar in southern Africa [...] although Lord Carnarvon nonetheless pushed ahead with his Confederation plan, which predictably failed {{and led to}} the confederation wars.|$|R
25|$|In 1860, Froude's wife Charlotte died; in 1861, {{he married}} her close friend Henrietta Warre, {{daughter}} of John Warre, M.P. for Taunton. Also in 1861 <b>Froude</b> became editor of Fraser's Magazine {{following the death}} of former editor John Parker, who was also Froude's publisher. <b>Froude</b> retained this editorship for fourteen years, resigning it in 1874 at the request of Thomas Carlyle, with whom he was working. In 1869 <b>Froude</b> was elected Lord Rector of St. Andrews, defeating Benjamin Disraeli by a majority of fourteen. In 1870, following the passage of the Clerical Disabilities Act (c. 91, Vict. XXXIII & XXXIV)("Bouverie's Act"), which permitted priests and deacons to resign from Holy Orders, <b>Froude</b> was finally able to officially rejoin the laity.|$|E
25|$|Rewe Skew Bridge, Rewe, Devon by William <b>Froude</b> (Bristol and Exeter Railway, 1844), one of {{possibly}} {{only two}} examples in Britain of the corne de vache method of brick construction pioneered by <b>Froude,</b> the other being at Cowley Bridge Junction {{on the same}} line.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after Carlyle's {{death in}} 1881, <b>Froude</b> {{published}} Carlyle's Reminiscences of Jane Welsh Carlyle. Carlyle's niece, Mrs. Alexander Carlyle, presented a note written by Carlyle in 1866 {{stating that the}} volume should not be published. On {{the basis of this}} note, she accused <b>Froude</b> of misconduct in publishing the volume, even though the fact that Carlyle had given the volume to <b>Froude</b> five years later suggested that he had changed his mind. Mrs. A. Carlyle also made claims of ownership over her uncle's papers, and over the profits from their publication.|$|E
25|$|His plight won him {{the sympathy}} of kindred spirits, such as George Eliot, Elizabeth Gaskell, and later Mrs. Humphrey Ward. Mrs. Ward's popular 1888 novel Robert Elsmere was largely {{inspired}} by {{this era of}} <b>Froude's</b> life.|$|R
25|$|In England, too, <b>Froude's</b> Irish {{history had}} its critics, most notably William Edward Hartpole Lecky in his History of England in the Eighteenth Century, the first volumes {{of which were}} {{published}} in 1878, and in reviews in Macmillan's Magazine.|$|R

25|$|The Ministers of the Cape Parliament went on {{to accuse}} Carnarvon of {{attempting}} to use the Cape to oppress the region and bring upon a war with the neighbouring Xhosa and Boer states. After Merriman confronted <b>Froude</b> in person, at an Uitenhage event which degenerated into fist fights, <b>Froude</b> gave no further public speeches.|$|E
25|$|In certain {{particular}} test cases, other similarity parameters must be satisfied, such as e.g. <b>Froude</b> number.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1864 Edward Augustus Freeman, a High Churchman, {{launched}} a critical campaign against <b>Froude</b> in the Saturday Review {{and later in}} the Contemporary Review, somewhat damaging Froude's scholarly reputation. In 1879, Freeman's review in the Contemporary Review of Froude's Short Study of Thomas Becket incited <b>Froude</b> to respond with a refutation in The Nineteenth Century which largely discredited Freeman's attacks and reaffirmed the value of Froude's manuscript research.|$|E
50|$|After his death, Newman {{and other}} friends edited the Remains, a {{collection}} of <b>Froude's</b> letters and journals. These were later interpreted by Sir Geoffrey Faber in his work Oxford Apostles, published in 1933 for the centenary of the Oxford Movement.|$|R

50|$|John Jacob Thomas, who {{published}} as J. J. Thomas (1841-1889) was a Trinidadian linguist and writer. He wrote a grammar of Trinidadian Creole (1869), but {{is best known}} for Froudacity (1889), a rebuttal of J. A. <b>Froude's</b> 1888 book The English in the West Indies.|$|R

25|$|Froudacity: West Indian Fables by James Anthony <b>Froude</b> is an 1889 polemic {{written by}} John Jacob Thomas as a {{rebuttal}} to James Anthony Froude's 1888 book The English in the West Indies. Froude's travelogue attacked the British West Indian colonies {{for wanting to}} establish self-government, arguing that if the majority black population were allowed to vote on leaders they would choose leaders that would repress the white population. Like many of his West Indian contemporaries, Thomas was outraged at the inaccuracies of Froude's text {{as well as the}} racist arguments that <b>Froude</b> uses as justification for his beliefs. He decided that writing a refutation to <b>Froude</b> was his patriotic duty and that it would act as self-vindication for West Indian blacks.|$|E

6000|$|... *Froude, vi. p. 311. **Relations Politiques, ii. 87, 183, 184. ***Sp. Cal. i. p. 133. Major Hume {{translates}} {{the text}} of Mr. <b>Froude's</b> transcript in the British Museum. It is a mere fragment; in 1883 the whole despatch was printed by Baron Kervyn de Lettenhove.|$|R
60|$|There is, of course, a {{story in}} Mr. <b>Froude's</b> novel. It {{is not simply a}} {{political}} disquisition. The interest of the tale, such as it is, centres round two men, Colonel Goring and Morty Sullivan, the Cromwellian and the Celt. These men are enemies by race and creed and feeling. The first represents Mr. <b>Froude's</b> cure for Ireland. He is a resolute 'Englishman, with strong Nonconformist tendencies,' who plants an industrial colony on the coast of Kerry, and has deep-rooted objections to that illicit trade with France which in the last century was the sole method by which the Irish people were enabled to pay their rents to their absentee landlords. Colonel Goring bitterly regrets that the Penal Laws against the Catholics are not rigorously carried out. He is a 'Police at any price' man.|$|R
5000|$|Fraser's {{background}} was an Inverness family, and he carried on business at 215 Regent Street, London. Fraser published many books, among them Thomas Carlyle's Hero Worship.
