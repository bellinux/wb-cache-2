5|$|As {{early as}} 1857 the Beetons had {{considered}} using the magazine columns {{as the basis}} of a book of collected recipes and homecare advice, Hughes believes, and in November 1859 they launched a series of 48-page monthly supplements with The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine. The print block for the whole series of the supplements was set from the beginning so the break between each edition was fixed at 48 pages, regardless of the text, and in several issues the text of a sentence or recipe is split between the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> instalment {{and the beginning of the}} next.|$|E
5|$|It {{was agreed}} that Broad Street would be closed, with trains {{diverted}} to Liverpool Street once a new connecting chord was built from the North London Line. Until this was done, {{it was possible}} to accommodate this last service from the outer <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> platform, and, in November that year, demolition of the station began. The remaining single platform was used until 27 June 1986. The station was formally closed on 30 June, along with Dalston Junction, the other station operating on the North London Line's City branch. Demolition of the station was completed by the end of 1986. The service from Watford to Liverpool Street was withdrawn on 28 September 1992, with Primrose Hill station, the only station exclusively served by the route from Watford to the City, being closed at the same time.|$|E

40|$|This study among 528 South African {{employees}} {{working in}} the construction industry examined the dimensionality of burnout and work engagement, using the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey, the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory, and the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale. On the basis of the literature, we predicted that cynicism and dedication are opposite <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> underlying attitude dimension (called “identification”), and that exhaustion and vigor are opposite <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> “energy ” dimension. Confirmatory factor analyses showed that while the attitude constructs represent opposite <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> continuum, the energy constructs do not—although they are highly correlated. These findings are also supported by the pattern of relationships between burnout and work engagement on the one hand, and predictors (i. e., work pressure, autonomy) and outcomes (i. e., organizational commitment, mental health) on the other hand. Implications for the measurement and conceptualization of burnout and work engagement are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Probably {{the most}} {{familiar}} form of cellular signaling is synaptic transmission, whereby a nerve impulse that has reached the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> neuron is conveyed to an adjacent neuron via the release of neurotransmitters.

These vesicles fuse with the cell membrane at the pre-synaptic terminal and release its contents to the exterior of the cell. The contents then diffuse across the synapse to the post-synaptic terminal.|$|E

Mickah intervenes and violently attacks Duffy, who is escorted out. Jimmy then goes on stage and introduces the band, which elicits boisterous cheers from the audience.|$|E

On the game's second play, Tech ran 58yards for a touchdown, courtesy of a trick play. After Mississippi fumbled, Tech recovered and scored another quick touchdown. At {{the end of the first}} quarter, Tech added a field goal to the two touchdowns it had already earned, making the score 170 at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> quarter. From that point onward, however, almost nothing would go in Virginia Tech's favor. Tech attempted an onside kick following the field goal, but were unable to successfully recover the ball.

Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) demands that Darryl read them aloud out of voyeuristic interest. Upon hearing them, most of the staff agree that his text messages, particularly an extended ellipsis at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>one,</b> are suggestive of Darryl wanting to be with Val. Val protests that the idea of her being romantically involved with Darryl is ridiculous. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) suggests that he try a bold step, saying that if Jim had not made romantic advances while she was still engaged to Roy, she never would have ended up marrying him. Darryl follows her advice and tells Val that a potential relationship is not ridiculous.|$|E
