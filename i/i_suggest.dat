5|$|Nobody {{could call}} {{the whole nation}} a criminal, nor the {{individuals}} that have aired their political views. If the right of conquest belongs by right to the conquering country, {{it would be fair}} for Spain to quit resisting the French and submit to them, by the same principles for which it is expected that the Americans submit themselves to the peoples of Pontevedra. The reason and the rule must be equal for everybody. Here there are no conquerors or conquered; here there are only Spaniards. The Spaniards of Spain have lost their land. The Spaniards of America are trying to save theirs. Let the ones from Spain deal with themselves as they can; do not worry, we American Spaniards know what we want and where we go. So <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> we vote: that we replace the Viceroy with a new authority that will be subject to the parent state if it is saved from the French, and independent if Spain is finally subjugated.|$|E
25|$|Simply put, this {{legislation}} ensures that we respect our obligations under Geneva, recognizes the President's constitutional authority to interpret treaties, and brings accountability and transparency {{to the process}} of interpretation by ensuring that the executive's interpretation is made public. I would note that there has been opposition to {{this legislation}} from some quarters, including the New York Times editorial page. Without getting into a point-by-point rebuttal here on the floor, I would simply say that I have been reading the Congressional Record trying to find the bill that page so vociferously denounced. The hyperbolic attack is aimed not at any bill this body is today debating, nor even at the Administration's original position. I can only presume that some would prefer that Congress simply ignore the Hamdan decision, and pass no legislation at all. That, <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> to my colleagues, would be a travesty.|$|E
25|$|By {{the will}} of my {{commander}} in chief, I have come to release the ownership over the Talysh regions {{from the hands of}} the Persians and therefore must take Lankaran. Knowing you are a valiant and prudent leader, I consider it necessary to warn that your resistance will be in vain. Even though you may be a great military leader, but you are no better than Abbas Mirza, who lost at Aslanduz and with that ten thousand soldiers, 500 men as prisoners, all the banners, weapons of which the troops don't have to their disposal right now. As it was at Aslanduz, where here barely escaped along with the 20th horsemen regiment and fled to Tabriz, while he had thirty thousand men at his disposal, and we had just two thousand men. Warriors of the great almighty in the world the Russian emperor crashed Abbas Mirza to pieces, and now they are located here, at the Talysh Khanate. So, when Abbas Mirza could not resist our victorious weapons, despite the fact that his troops outnumbered ours by fifteen times, you reflect that you won't be able either to inflict us a mortal blow here; so <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> that you agree to voluntarily surrender the fortress to avoid harmful and unnecessary bloodshed, sparing both Abbas Mirza's as well as my warriors. Consider of what you will reach by following sanity, namely saving lives, dignity, and both your property and all affiliated parties' properties in this conflict; otherwise, you will lose everything, if you won't attend the voice of common sense. But it is my duty to tell you, as you will be the one to choose; only I shall be justified in front of God and humanity. I'm ordered not to bombard yet by this letter until I receive response and receipt within three hours.|$|E

500|$|The opening {{sequence}} {{received a}} generally mixed response. Nelson Shin, {{the founder of}} AKOM, the Korean company that animates The Simpsons, {{said that he and}} his staff did protest being asked to animate the sequence. Shin said that the sequence suggests that animators work in sweatshops, but they actually work in [...] "high-tech workshops". He added, [...] "Most of the content was about degrading people from Korea, China, Mexico and Vietnam. If Banksy wants to criticize these things ... <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> that he learn more about it first." ...|$|E

500|$|In The Scotsman, Graham Leicester {{writes that}} the [...] "overblown rhetoric invites a sceptical reaction. But <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> we just accept this {{extraordinary}} compliment graciously." [...] It was likely influenced by Thomas Cahill's How the Irish Saved Civilization {{and the result of}} a marketing strategy. Several reviewers found that Herman was successful in proving that Scots did have a disproportionate impact on modernity. Herman continued this type of theme with his next book, To Rule the Waves: How the British Navy Shaped the Modern World, published in 2004.|$|E

Felton worked on Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix throughout 2006. Having read more of the Harry Potter books, Felton reflected: [...] "I have had input into Draco.

The document, signed by Heidemann, finished with a veiled threat: [...] "If our company thinks that the risk is too great, <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> that I should seek out a publishing company in the United States which could put up the money and ensure that we get the German publication rights." [...] The pair did not show the prospectus to anyone at Stern, but instead presented it to Gruner + Jahr's deputy managing director, Dr Jan Hensmann, and Manfred Fischer; they also requested a 200,000mark deposit from the publisher to secure the rights with Kujau. After a meeting that lasted {{a little over two}} hours, and with no recourse to an expert or historian, the deposit was authorised. As soon as the meeting ended, at about 7pm, Heidemann travelled to Stuttgart, with the deposit money, to meet Kujau.|$|E

500|$|The {{first act}} of the new rulers of Syria was to {{establish}} the twenty-man National Council for the Revolutionary Command (NCRC), composed of twelve Ba'athists and eight Nasserists and independents. On 9 March, the NCRC ordered Salah al-Din al-Bitar, one of the Ba'ath Party founders, to form a government, and to implement {{the policies of the}} NCRC. Later, six civilians were given membership in NCRC, three Ba'athists (Aflaq, al-Bitar and Mansur al-Atrash) and three Nasserists. However, this did not change the balance of power, and the officers still controlled the country. From the beginning, the military committee members formed state policies behind the backs of other NCRC members – when the civilian leadership found out, [...] al-Atrash said: [...] "Why do not these gentlemen speak? May <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> they appoint a liaison officer to communicate their views to us?" [...] From that day, Umran gave the civilians a faint idea of what the committee members were planning.|$|E
500|$|The first {{shipping}} line to begin regular transatlantic steamer services was the British and North American Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, {{better known as}} the Cunard Line in recognition of its founder, the Canadian Samuel Cunard. It began its operations on July 4, 1840, when [...] left Liverpool for Boston, via Halifax, Nova Scotia. As the principal transatlantic mail carrier, the Cunard Line received subsidies from the British government and from the United States Post Office Department, the latter a point that rankled with some Americans, who felt that a home-owned line should be the beneficiary. [...] Senator James A. Bayard of Delaware was among those urging Congress to subsidize a US steamship line: [...] "America will soon become tired of being informed of British maritime supremacy... <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> that Congress grant a carefully selected American shipping expert a completely free hand to proceed with the absolute conquest of this man Cunard". In 1845 the postmaster general invited tenders for a transatlantic mail contract. The successful bidder, announced on March 3, 1847, was New York shipowner Edward Knight Collins.|$|E
500|$|Nixon {{then called}} for Stevenson {{to give a}} full {{accounting}} of his own fund, and a full list of the donors. He also called for Senator Sparkman, who, as Nixon repeated, had put his wife on the payroll, to state fully any outside income he might have had. [...] "Because, folks, remember, a man that's to be President of the United States, a man that's to be Vice President of the United States must have the confidence of all the people. And that's why I'm doing what I'm doing, and that's why <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> that Mr. Stevenson and Mr. Sparkman since they are under attack should do what I am doing." [...] As the senator made this point, Eisenhower, sitting in the Cleveland office, slammed his pencil down, realizing {{that he would not}} be allowed to be the only major party candidate whose finances would evade scrutiny. Eisenhower had benefited from a favorable Act of Congress, allowing the income from his bestselling memoirs to be considered capital gains.|$|E

500|$|In July 1933, Gernsback {{dismissed}} Lasser as editor. Lasser {{had become}} active in promoting workers' rights and was spending less {{time on his}} editorial duties. According to Lasser, Gernsback told him [...] "if you like working with the unemployed so much, <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> you go and join them". It is likely that cost-cutting was also a consideration, as Lasser was paid $65 per week, a substantial salary in those days. Soon after Lasser was let go, Gernsback received a fanzine, The Fantasy Fan, from a reader, Charles Hornig. Gernsback called Hornig to his office to interview him for the position of editor; Hornig {{turned out to be}} only17, but Gernsback asked him to proofread a manuscript and decided that the results were satisfactory. Hornig was hired at an initial salary of $20 per week. That same year, Gernsback dissolved Stellar Publications and created Continental Publications as the new publisher for Wonder Stories. The schedule stuttered for the first time, missing the July and September 1933 issues; the recent bankruptcy of the company's distributor, Eastern Distributing Corporation, may have been partly responsible for this disruption. The first issue with Continental on the masthead, and the first listing Hornig as editor, was November 1933.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} well {{received}} by film critics {{and even the}} passing mentions in The Moving Picture World remarked {{that it was a}} good offering with good photography. Jack Harvey's debut film as a director was well received by the public due to its [...] "universally appealing" [...] theme. Thanhouser writes that the [...] "loyal dog's attachment to his little girl playmate is treated with pictorial beauty and simple, honest sentiment", and notes that when it was released on October 4, 1914, reviewers praised the [...] "double-exposure passages for their dramatic effectiveness". Louis Reeves Harrison of The Moving Picture World review of the film stated, [...] "This play becomes one of delicate pathos toward the end through some remarkable feats of double exposure, and it is one of beauty throughout because of the acting of a four-year-old tot, Baby Helen, a veritable star in her class. Shep contributes with exceptional intelligence - he is not eternally looking at his master out of scope for a word of command. ... I do not know what director handled this subject, but <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> he apply his thought visualizations to the human characters of future stories. It is the exhibition of what passes in the minds and hearts of characters that brings an audience into closer sympathy with them and makes tense interest possible when melodrama merely brings a laugh. The double exposures are timed with such skill in this instance that all concerned in their production deserve high praise. They give beauty and dignity to a very simple story." ...|$|E
2500|$|On the {{so-called}} [...] "Blainey affair", Australian prime minister John Howard would remark: [...] "Nowhere, <b>I</b> <b>suggest,</b> have the fangs {{of the left}} so visibly been on display {{as they were in}} a campaign based on character assassination and intellectual dishonesty through their efforts to trash the name and reputation of that great Australian historian Geoffrey Blainey." ...|$|E

2500|$|November – Ernest L.
