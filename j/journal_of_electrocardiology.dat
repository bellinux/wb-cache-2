40|$|Robust Generalised Cross-Validation was {{proposed}} {{recently as a}} method for determining near optimal regularisation parameters in inverse problems. It was introduced to overcome {{a problem with the}} regular Generalised Cross-Validation method in which the function that is minimised to obtain the regularisation parameter often has a broad, flat minimum, resulting in a poor estimate for the parameter. The robust method defines a new function to be minimised which has a narrower minimum, but at the expense of introducing a new parameter called the robustness parameter. In this study, the Robust Generalised Cross-Validation method is applied to the inverse problem <b>of</b> <b>electrocardiology.</b> It is demonstrated that, for realistic situations, the robustness parameter can be set to zero. With this choice of robustness parameter, it is shown that the robust method is able to obtain estimates of the regularisation parameter in the inverse problem <b>of</b> <b>electrocardiology</b> that are comparable to, or better than, many of the standard methods that are applied to this inverse problem.

40|$|This book {{covers the}} main {{mathematical}} and numerical models in computational electrocardiology, ranging from microscopic membrane models of cardiac ionic channels to macroscopic bidomain, monodomain, eikonal models and cardiac source representations. These advanced multiscale and nonlinear models describe the cardiac bioelectrical activity from the cell {{level to the}} body surface and are employed in both the direct and inverse problems <b>of</b> <b>electrocardiology.</b> The book also covers advanced numerical techniques needed to efficiently carry out large-scale cardiac simulations, including time and space discretizations, decoupling and operator splitting techniques, parallel finite element solvers. These techniques are employed in 3 D cardiac simulations illustrating the excitation mechanisms, the anisotropic effects on excitation and repolarization wavefronts, the morphology of electrograms in normal and pathological tissue and some reentry phenomena.

40|$|Diagnostics of {{cardiovascular}} system conditions and diseases {{is considered the}} most important task <b>of</b> <b>electrocardiology.</b> The aim <b>of</b> the study is to define geometric parameters of the patient heart and the synthesis of a realistic three-dimensional heart image based {{on a series of}} two-dimensional images obtained by computer tomography. The preparation and further processing of medical image data is an important initial step for further study of the heart electrodynamic activity. The problem is solved with the help of computer tomography method by preparing a series of images of the patient heart. The technique of volumetric rendering is applied to represent certain anatomical structures in a three-dimensional (3 D) graphical form.
