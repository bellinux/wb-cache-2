5|$|This one I had {{the most}} amount of input. I oversaw everything—the {{building}} of the sets, everyone's costumes, I had meetings with make-up and hair and the cinematographer, everybody. Casting, finding the right cat—just every aspect. Kind of like making a little movie. We basically sat down and just threw out all every idea we could possibly conceive of {{and of all the}} things we wanted. All the imagery we wanted—and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> set ideas, for instance the cat and the idea of Metropolis. I definitely wanted to have that influence, that look on all the men—the workers, diligently, methodically working away.|$|E
25|$|I thought I was in with {{a chance}} but I didn't want to build up my hopes. The way I worked it out, {{it was to be}} me or Ken MacLeay and I knew <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years {{experience}} on him, having played Tests and more Sheffield Shield. This is the biggest thrill apart from my 1981 Test selection in England and helping bring back the Sheffield Shield to NSW last year.|$|E
500|$|Eastwood had {{declared}} in that interview, [...] "I’m not {{on either side}} of the aisle. I think most Americans are going, 'What the ... ? Is this all we can do?' ... When there were 17 people on the stage , I thought, well, there are three or four people up there I could see voting for. They seem pretty good. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> …. [...] And then I thought, what the hell happened?" ...|$|E
50|$|Havelock, John Lawrence, Henry Lawrence, Peel and Outram <b>Is.</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> tidal creeks winding {{into their}} interiors; in general {{freshwater}} streams are few.|$|R
6000|$|... “It is,” he said, “a {{thing one}} does not admit in Santa Marta, but if one might reward a {{kindness}} with money <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> dollars.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thank you, sir. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{things to}} get, and I {{would rather not}} report myself until to-morrow afternoon, if you will give me leave." ...|$|R
500|$|After {{defeating}} Nikolay Davydenko at Wimbledon 2012, Murray pointed upwards {{with both}} hands and wagged them back and forth while looking to the sky. Murray declined to reveal the reason, and ever since, he has continued to celebrate his victories with this gesture. Murray marked his first Wimbledon title in 2013 with the same victory salute. Then in his book 'Seventy-Seven; My Path to Wimbledon Glory', released in November 2013, Murray said: “The real reason is that around that time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> friends and family who had various issues affecting them [...] [...] [...] I knew that they would be watching and I wanted to let them know I was thinking of them.” ...|$|E
500|$|Despite {{constant}} thefts, {{particularly of}} livestock, Seacole's establishment prospered. Chapter XIV of Wonderful Adventures describes the meals and supplies provided to officers. They were closed at 8 pm daily and on Sundays. Seacole {{did some of}} the cooking herself: [...] "Whenever <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> leisure moments, I used to wash my hands, roll up my sleeves, and roll out pastry." [...] When called to [...] "dispense medications," [...] she did so. Soyer was a frequent visitor, and praised Seacole's offerings, noting that she offered him champagne on his first visit. The Special Correspondent of The Times newspaper wrote approvingly of her work: [...] "...Mrs. Seacole...doctors and cures all manner of men with extraordinary success. She is always in attendance near the battle-field to aid the wounded, and has earned many a poor fellow’s blessings." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the match, Chelsea manager José Mourinho {{claimed that}} the gesture he made had been {{intended}} for the media and not Liverpool fans: [...] "The signal of close your mouth was not for them but for the press, they speak too much and in my opinion they try to do everything to disturb Chelsea. Wait, don't speak too soon. We lost two matches and in my opinion you (the media) try to take confidence from us and put pressure on us." [...] Mourinho was happy that Chelsea had won but said the victory was not special: [...] "It's just one more. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> before this, I'm very happy to win. It's important for the fans, for the club and especially for the players." [...] Striker Eiður Guðjohnsen said Chelsea's victory was down to their hard work ethic: [...] "It was a very intense and even game {{and it was hard}} to break them down, but hard work pays off in the end." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{is it not}} possible," [...] I urged, [...] "by dint of {{patience}} and exertion, to discover additional evidence? Miss Halcombe and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred pounds----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I shall {{hold you}} as a hostage for the box. Besides, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> words to say to you, boy," [...] he added grimly. [...] "Write." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'To tell yer the truth, <b>I</b> <b>'ad</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{words with}} my old man. But one doesn't like them {{things to get}} abaht; yer won't tell anyone, will yer?' ...|$|R
2500|$|... "The {{team was}} on a {{campaign}} and I didn't want to jeopardise it so I just tried to keep myself up. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> talks with Bob [...] and Bruce [...] but I didn't tell them what I thought it was. I didn't want to worry anyone because we all had a job to do... and we did the job." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{acquired}} the nickname [...] "Temperance Willie" [...] while {{serving in the}} RCAF. His anti-liquor attitudes formed in his early years {{as a result of}} his father's alcoholism as well as his Methodist upbringing and experiences in the military. He admitted to having a few drinks during World War I, [...] "Of course I've had a drink, you cannot go through two world wars without taking a drink," [...] he told the Globe and Mail but added [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> on Nov. 11, 1918, but I don't really remember having any since." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{told him}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> pounds still {{remaining}} to me, but that after that was gone I should be penniless.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} will excuse this intrusion," [...] at last he muttered; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> words of {{business}} to which I will request your attention presently." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{encourage}} me to {{hope for}} the best," [...] Sir Timothy said, rising to his feet. [...] "You will excuse me now? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> final preparations to make." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, yes, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{words to}} say," [...] Easton, {{who had been}} sitting {{on the table and}} had {{hitherto}} not opened his lips, remarked in a quiet voice.|$|R
60|$|That {{sounds very}} formidable. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> minutes to spare while some letters were being {{prepared}} for me to sign. But in any case I'm always at your service.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{of course}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> larks! You cannot expect {{a fellow who}} has been away from England for a year to walk about as soberly {{as if he were}} a Methodist parson!" ...|$|E
60|$|Growing bold, {{and feeling}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> hundred {{thousand}} folk at my back, I demanded whether Tom Sawyer married Judge Thatcher's daughter {{and whether we}} were ever going to hear of Tom Sawyer as a man.|$|E
6000|$|... "No doubt," [...] said Sir Charles. [...] "Shall {{we return}} to the gallery? <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> treasures there that {{photography}} is not likely to surpass for some time yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} glad," [...] he said, [...] "if {{you will come}} in and shut the door. If you are Miss Ruth Lalonde, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{questions}} to ask you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{exceedingly}} {{fortunate to}} find you both here," [...] the newcomer observed, as he removed his cap. [...] "Captain, may <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> minutes' conversation with you and Mr. Dix?" ...|$|R
60|$|Afterwards, while {{pretending to}} give him certain {{articles}} out of the waggon, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> private words with Umslopogaas, {{who told me that}} the arrangement was that he should be allowed to escape at night with his people.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's flattering. But I'm {{not sure}} that I meant as a whole; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{particular}} instances in my mind. Bella Crestwick, for example; I'm curious {{to hear what you}} think of her. She seems quite favorably impressed with you." ...|$|E
60|$|After a {{while the}} gentlemen {{came back to the}} drawing room, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> moments of very pleasant, {{friendly}} conversation with Mr. Dickens. They are both people that one could not know a little of without desiring to know more.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sir; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{questions}} to ask. Now, Mr. Cousins, {{you say that}} you took part in dragging the canal. You are in charge of the drags, are you not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Since we are {{upon the}} subject of dress, may <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> words? You <b>have</b> given {{expression}} to your dislikes quite freely. You will not mind if I do the same?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, a {{horse and}} a camel; but <b>I</b> shall <b>have</b> no {{difficulty}} in managing about them. Excuse my asking, sir, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> stores. Shall <b>I</b> bring them on board?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hate it, but I must do something. I {{could not}} live on charity. If I knew any other way I could make money, I would rather, {{but there is no}} other way. I tried once to give music lessons. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> pupils, but they never paid--they never do pay.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Have patience, Friend {{of all the}} World'--Kim {{started at}} the title. 'Would <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> of the years that so irk thee. I have proved thee in several small ways. This will not be {{forgotten}} when I make my report to the Colonel Sahib.' Then, changing suddenly into English with a deep laugh: ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{sentences}} more {{to add to}} my diary {{before going}} to bed myself, and as I went down again to the drawing-room after leaving Laura for the last time that weary day, I resolved merely to show myself there, to make my excuses, and then to retire an hour earlier than usual for the night.|$|E
6000|$|... "Go {{and find}} Lady Elisabeth," [...] Mr. Foley directed. [...] "She {{was a little}} hurt {{at the idea that}} you were not coming. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> more words to say to Armley." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “No, señor,” {{said the}} other, as Appleby had expected. “Since the war makes pesetas scarce one drinks the thin {{red wine and}} caña here. Still, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> bottles with the seal on.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will see}} you at the Pavilion in half an hour," [...] Mr. Sabin said. [...] "In the meantime, you will please excuse us. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> words to say to my niece." ...|$|R
