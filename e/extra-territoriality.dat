60|$|Sooner or later, the encroachments {{of foreign}} Powers upon the {{sovereign}} rights of China must be swept away. The Chinese must recover the Treaty Ports, {{control of the}} tariff, and so on; they must also free themselves from <b>extra-territoriality.</b> But all this can probably be done, {{as it was in}} Japan, without offending foreign Powers (except perhaps the Japanese). It {{would be a mistake to}} complicate the early stages of Chinese recovery by measures which would antagonize foreign Powers in general. Russia was in a stronger position for defence than China, yet Russia has suffered terribly from the universal hostility provoked by the Bolsheviks. Given good government and a development of China's resources, it will be possible to obtain most of the needed concessions by purely diplomatic means; the rest can wait for a suitable opportunity.|$|E
60|$|In {{regard to}} mines, {{development}} by the Chinese themselves is urgent, since undeveloped resources tempt the greed of the Great Powers, and development by foreigners {{makes it possible}} to keep China enslaved. It should therefore be enacted that, in future, no sale of mines or of any interest in mines to foreigners, and no loan from foreigners on the security of mines, will be recognized as legally valid. In view of <b>extra-territoriality,</b> {{it will be difficult to}} induce foreigners to accept such legislation, and Consular Courts will not readily admit its validity. But, as the example of <b>extra-territoriality</b> in Japan shows, such matters depend upon the national strength; if the Powers fear China, they will recognize the validity of Chinese legislation, but if not, not. In view of the need of rapid development of mining by Chinese, it would probably be unwise to nationalize all mines here and now. It would be better to provide every possible encouragement to genuinely Chinese private enterprise, and to offer the assistance of geological and mining experts, etc. The Government should, however, retain the right (a) to buy out any mining concern at a fair valuation; (b) to work minerals itself in cases where the private owners fail to do so, in spite of expert opinion in favour of their being worked. These powers should be widely exercised, and as soon as mining has reached the point compatible with national security, the mines should be all nationalized, except where, as at Tayeh, diplomatic agreements stand in the way. It is clear that the Tayeh mines must be recovered by China as soon as opportunity offers, but when or how that will be it is as yet impossible to say. Of course I have been assuming an orderly government established in China, but without that nothing vigorous can be done to repel foreign aggression. This is a point to which, along with other general questions connected with the industrializing of China, I shall return in my last chapter.|$|E
6000|$|I drifted {{about with}} him in his gondola, and {{refreshed}} myself, long a-hungered for such talk, with his talk of literary life in London. Through some acquaintance I had made in Venice I was able to be of use to him in getting documents copied for him in the Venetian Archives, especially the Relations of the Venetian Ambassadors at different courts during the period and events he was studying. All such papers passed through my hands in transmission to the historian, though now I do not quite know why they need have done so; but perhaps he was willing to give me the pleasure of being a partner, however humble, in the enterprise. My recollection of him is of courtesy to a far younger man unqualified by patronage, and of a presence of singular dignity and grace. He was one of the handsomest men I ever saw, with beautiful eyes, a fine blond beard of modish cut, and a sensitive nose, straight and fine. He was altogether a figure of worldly splendor; and I had reason to know that he did not let the credit of our nation suffer at the most aristocratic court in Europe for want of a fit diplomatic costume, when some of our ministers were trying to make their office do its full effect upon all occasions in [...] "the dress of an American gentleman." [...] The morning after his arrival Mr. Motley came to me with a handful of newspapers which, according to the Austrian custom at that day, had been opened in the Venetian post-office. He wished me to protest against this on his behalf as an infringement of his diplomatic <b>extra-territoriality,</b> and I proposed to go at once to the director of the post: I had myself suffered in the same way, and though I knew that a mere consul was helpless, I was willing to see the double-headed eagle trodden under foot by a Minister Plenipotentiary. Mr. Motley said that he would go with me, and we put off in his gondola to the post-office. The director received us with the utmost deference. He admitted the irregularity which the minister complained of, and declared that {{he had no choice but}} to open every foreign newspaper, to whomsoever addressed. He suggested, however, that if the minister made his appeal to the Lieutenant-Governor of Venice, Count Toggenburg would no doubt instantly order the exemption of his newspapers from the general rule.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of U.S. pressure, the British {{government}} agreed in early October 1942 {{to enter into negotiations}} with the Chinese government regarding the abrogation of <b>extra-territoriality,</b> and on October 9, the U.S. and British governments officially notified the Chinese government of their initiative to that effect.|$|E
50|$|First {{indication}} for Chinese {{aspirations to}} abolish <b>extra-territoriality</b> came around August 1942, {{in a conversation}} between Wang Beng-shen, advisor to Chiang Kai-shek on Japanese affairs, {{and member of the}} British embassy in Chongqing. The Chinese adviser stated that the Chinese government desired to abolish extra-territorial rights in Shanghai, and was willing to grant some special status to British companies in that city.|$|E
5000|$|The need {{to modify}} the {{conditions}} of extra-territorial rights in China arose from the dire situation of Chinese-British-U.S. military cooperation following the Japanese invasion of China in 1937 and later during the Second World War. On 18 July 1940, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill declared in Parliament his government's intention of relinquishing extra-territorial rights in China once peace was concluded. The issue was raised again following the outbreak {{of war in the}} Pacific in December 1941, and at this point the British position was greatly influenced by the U.S. position. Already in March 1942, agreement was reached among State Department officials regarding the need to modify existing agreements with the Chinese government in the latter's favour in order to improve relations. On 25 April 1942, the British government sounded its positions on the matter in a memorandum to the U.S. government, in which it agreed to abolish extra-territorial jurisdiction in principle, but suggested to postpone negotiations to that effect {{until the end of the}} war. On 6 May 1942, the U.S. government responded to the British memorandum that it was not desirable to abrogate <b>extra-territoriality</b> in China at the moment, but that it would consider doing so in case approached about it by the Chinese government. On 27 August 1942, U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull suggested that in case negotiations for relinquishing <b>extra-territoriality</b> commence, the following provisions should be included in the treaty: ...|$|E

In 1938, Poland participated in the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia by annexing Zaolzie. In 1939, Hitler claimed <b>extra-territoriality</b> for the Reichsautobahn Berlin-Königsberg and a change in Danzig's status, in exchange for promises of territory in Poland's neighbours and a 25-year extension of the non-aggression pact. Poland refused, fearing losing de facto access to the sea, subjugation as a German satellite state or client state, and future further German demands. In August 1939, Hitler delivered an ultimatum to Poland on Danzig's status.|$|E

5000|$|The French {{were well}} aware of China's sensitivities {{regarding}} Japan, and as early as June 1883, in the wake of Rivière's death at Paper Bridge, began angling for an alliance with Japan to offset their precarious military position in Tonkin. The French foreign minister Paul Challemel-Lacour believed that France [...] "ought not to disdain the support which, at an appropriate moment, the attitude of Japan would be able to supply to our actions". In order to court the Japanese government, France offered to support, against British opposition, Japan's pleas for revision of the unequal treaties of the Bakumatsu era, which provided <b>extra-territoriality</b> and advantageous tariffs to foreigners. Japan welcomed the offer of French support, but was reluctant to be drawn into a military alliance. Japan was in effect quite worried of the military might China represented, at least on paper, at that time. As the situation in Annam deteriorated however, France was even more anxious to obtain Japanese help.|$|E
40|$|The geopolitical {{significance}} of Pakistan in the Global War on Terror {{has led to}} multiple instances of the US acting in an extra-territorial manner. Repeated territorial intrusion by the US strains US-Pakistan relations because <b>extra-territoriality</b> {{is viewed as a}} violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty. This study analyzes Pakistani-English political cartoons to examine the ways the US <b>extra-territoriality</b> is represented. Approximately 2940 political cartoons are collected from four Pakistani-English newspapers: Dawn, The Express Tribune, The Nation, and The News. Wallerstein’s world-system theory provides the theoretical backdrop to demonstrate the explicit (military) and implicit (economic, cultural, and political/diplomatic) means a hegemonic-core power can act extra-territorially towards a state in the periphery. A combination of content analysis and social semiotic analysis methodologies is used. Content analysis reveals a total of 323 US-related political cartoons that are classified into themes of economic, cultural, military, and political/diplomatic depictions in political cartoons. A visual social semiotic analysis deconstructs the visual rhetoric of <b>extra-territoriality</b> as expressed in the various themed political cartoons. The outcome of these two methodologies provides a holistic illustration of the ways US <b>extra-territoriality</b> in a sovereign but periphery state like Pakistan is viewed...|$|E
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I argue that, {{since the}} 1980 s, French airports {{have been designed}} to exclude people from legal, human and refugee rights. The particular space where this happens has been successively called “international zone”, “transit zone” and “waiting zone” and its scope has been significantly extended overtime. I contend that French authorities have used the concept of <b>extra-territoriality</b> in concert with the material design of the airport to sustain exclusion. While this research focuses on France, findings bear relevance to the global governance of migrants and refugees. The French case epitomizes how states creatively use the law (or absence thereof) and geography to keep undesirable non-citizens, including asylum claimants, away from their territories. In the 1980 s and early 1990 s, the government established Paris airports’ international zones as non-French, extra-territorial spaces to circumvent domestic and international laws. I use the term “extra-territoriality” with a hyphen to refer to this deliberate excision of territory. When the Law on the Waiting Zone came into existence in 1992, exclusion was reinvented through another form of <b>extra-territoriality,</b> premised on the non-citizen’s legal status at the border. Since then, the term “waiting zone” has assigned both legal and geographical dimensions to this place. This research topic matters as this law established a parallel, less protective legal framework for foreign nationals arriving at the border compared to the one applicable to their counterparts already deemed on French soil - who are either applying for asylum or are to be removed after being caught for staying illegally in the country -. Yet France is a liberal democracy bound by obligations under human rights and refugee conventions at the regional and international levels. Is a less protective system of rights based on the distinction between physical and legal entry necessary? I was drawn to the waiting zone for my research because it is an understudied area; the waiting zone is physically difficult to access, yet important to understand. I chose to focus on Paris Roissy-Charles de Gaulle (CDG) airport’s waiting zone, which detains the greatest number of individuals in France. I sought to answer several research questions. First, how did the Law on the Waiting Zone come to existence? Second, does the Law on the Waiting Zone constitute a break from the initial phase of <b>extra-territoriality?</b> In other words, is the term “extra-territoriality” inappropriate to describe the current situation of non-citizens placed under the waiting zone regime? Third, how do actors working in and on the waiting zone perceive this legal regime and their role therein? Finally, how are foreign nationals being treated in CDG airport’s waiting zone? Do they have access to rights, or do they face barriers? Different research methods were used to answer these questions. I engaged in discourse analysis of a variety of sources and carried out 35 semi-structured expert interviews. Participants were asked to answer questions regarding their perception of the legal framework applying to the border zone, their role and actions therein. Finally, I used the participant observation method at CDG airport...|$|E
40|$|Charter of Rightsimmigration lawsecurity certificatesnational security“The Sovereign Charter” {{takes as}} its {{starting}} point the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in Charkaoui v Canada, which struck down some {{portions of the}} security certiﬁcate process of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act as contrary to s. 7 of the Charter. Although this decision was hailed as a victory, I argue that Charkaoui redraws long-standing divisions along long-standing lines of alleged risk, allegiance and origin. I then explore the emergence of tentative shifts in jurisprudential conceptions of state sovereignty and <b>extra-territoriality</b> {{through a consideration of}} four post-Charkaoui decisions: the two judgments in the Omar Khadr matter, the Amnesty International claim regarding Afghan POWs detained by the Canadian military and a case with respect to an over- seas RCMP investigation. The article then develops three arguments about the dialectical process by which changing notions of sovereignty both determine and are reﬂected in the territorial reach of the Charter, and theorize this process as one in which rights continue to constrain ways of challenging disciplinary power {{at the same time as}} they minimally limit its reach. These three meditations consider rights and sovereignty as a juridical “act”, through the lens of international law and in the context of biopolitics.

International and Comparative Law Quarterly, 63 (03), 665 - 697 The {{almost two}} decade-long bonanza of civil {{litigation}} concerning gross {{human rights violations}} committed by corporations under the US Alien Tort Statute 1789 was scaled back by the US Supreme Court in Kiobel v Royal Dutch Petroleum in April 2013. The court restricted the territorial reach of human rights claims against transnational corporations by holding that the presumption against <b>extra-territoriality</b> applied to the Act. Thus Shell, the Dutch/British defendant, and the role it played in the brutal suppression by the Nigerian military of the Ogoni peoples? protest movement against the environmental devastation caused by oil exploration, lay outside the territorial scope of the Act. Legal accountability must lie in a State with a stronger connection with the dispute. While this article briefly engages with the Supreme Court decision, its main {{focus is on the}} attitude of Western governments to the corporate human rights litigation under the ATS as articulated in their amicus briefs. In these briefs they objected to the statute?s excessive extraterritoriality and horizontal application of human rights to artificial non-State actors. In these two respects corporate ATS litigation created significant inroads into the conventional State-centric approach to human rights and thus provided an opportunity for more effective human rights enjoyment. This article tests the validity of the objections of Western governments to corporate human rights obligations under the ATS against the norms of public international law and against the substantive demands arising out of the shortfalls of the international human rights enforcement. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|E

It has an international profile, participating in art fairs in Basel, Miami, the Armory and Moscow Biennale {{as well as}} curating events at Tate Modern. I was invited by the curator to participate alongside three artists of international standing in the exhibition Surface Wave 2007. Support was provided by Camberwell, and galleries:Art Concept, Paris; Iris Kadel, Karlsruhe; Roslyn Oxley, Sydney; and Michael Lett, Auckland. The exhibition examined {{the way in which}} meaning and significance can be articulated at the borderline between one medium and another. The invitation was a direct consequence of my research over Oct-Dec 2006 during my Abbey Fellowship in Painting at the British School at Rome. This award is a juried, open competition and was additionally supported by winning a research sabbatical from UAL. My research was figured around the epistemology of painting practice, its extensions into architecture, exegetical and temporal orders, with a particular concern for the movement of the image through time and prevailing ideologies, in the Warburgian sense of a ‘Gespenstergeschichte’. My practice has involved the displacement of images between media, with an emphasis on both the place or topos of transition and on the potential for <b>extra-territoriality</b> produced by framing and ordering devices like the cartouche and the crypto-porticus. The BSR facilitated the development of my research within an international, interdisciplinary context. Discussion with classicists, archaeologists and historians around the uses of images as well as study of antique and renaissance imaging systems allowed me to formulate new questions about the movement of the image through time, media and the social constructions of viewing. Outcomes include a lecture and exhibitions at the British School and in Bologna and have been further developed in a solo show, Huis Clos, Five Years, London 2007...|$|E
40|$|Shanghai and Hong Kong {{are very}} much like blood sisters. Shanghai is called the Lustrous Pearl of the Orient; Hong Kong, the Pearl of the East. Like two stars on the China coast, the two cities {{have a lot in}} common, in terms of geography, history, and challenges. Strategically placed {{at the mouth of the}} Yangtze River and Pearl River estuaries, both cities command the {{physical}} and social capital of rich hinterlands. They also bear witness to the turbulent history of China as their destiny is linked to western forays into Qing China on her knees. The momentous stroke that rewrote their history is of course the Opium War and the Treaty of Nanking (1842). Foremost among the humiliations were territorial concessions. Hong Kong was ceded to Britain as a colony, a status that was to last until 1997. The same treaty also turned Shanghai into a treaty port and semicolony, when the principle of <b>extra-territoriality</b> took the physical form of the international settlements. However infamous the past may be, the insulation from the most vicious wars and turmoil that besieged the China heartland was the key to Shanghai and Hong Kong's success. In the process, the twins evolved into the great hubs of trade and industry unmatched by any other Chinese city. Of equal importance has been the absorption of hundreds of thousands of immigrants, among them entrepreneurs, intellectuals, revolutionaries, artisans, and ordinary people. The mixing of the most adventurous and enterprising elements from within China and from all over the world underlaid the fantastic blending of cultures and practices. This not only turned them into great metropolises, but it also gave a big push to China's modernization. At the same time, unbridled growth in the context of cultural bastardy sired many social problemsâdrugs, crime, prostitution, poverty, and exploitationâthat bestowed both with an aura of exotic decadence. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe eighteenth- and nineteenth-century rise of {{an elite}} non-Muslim {{merchant}} community in Aleppo benefitted both the Empire and the community’s three component groups: Europeans, Jews from Livorno or Venice, and local Christian Arabs, Armenians and Greeks. The dramatic financial and social ascent of this Levantine society resulted largely from three economic policies energetically pursued by the Porte to spur trade with the Muslim-suspicious West. First, increasingly broad Imperial capitulations granted Europeans and their non-Muslim local protï¿½gï¿½s tax exemptions {{and the right to}} adjudicate cases in their consular courts. Later, the Ottomans extended these <b>extra-territoriality</b> privileges to any participating local trader, minority or Muslim. Finally, the Empire inaugurated wide-ranging Tanzimat reforms integrating non-Muslim subjects as fully equal. As a result of these policy shifts, even when the nineteenth-century decline in trade led joint stock companies like the English Levant Company, the French Levant Company and the Dutch VOC to abandon Aleppo, individual European merchants [...] traditional mediators for Western enterprises and for Muslim traders [...] could create and expand their family trade networks regionally and could simultaneously serve as European nations’ business representatives and diplomatic consuls. Classic Ottomanists have depicted these Imperial economic decisions as proof of Imperial paralysis, rigidity, and weakness vis-ï¿½-vis the West. But the revisionist view, supported by the archival evidence this dissertation presents, finds that the Porte actively, innovatively, and forcefully enacted these strategies to advance its own international trade and to aid its own traders of any national origin. These far-reaching laws purposively hoisted the status and power of the hybrid Levantine community which could uniquely and usefully bridge East and West by belonging equally to both. As a privileged class, Levantines kept their identity and elevation by fluency in both native and foreign languages and cultures, by establishing clan-based trade networks, and by exclusionary marriage practices. Yet their characteristic cosmopolitanism won them the irreplaceable role as the financial, diplomatic, and cultural link between the Empire and Europe. This connection perpetuated the commercial power of the Porte, in the face of impending Western hegemony, for an impressive period, just as it maintained the Levantine identity until this century...|$|E
40|$|The {{fluidity}} of dislocation as {{an experience}} of transnational identity through moving images ABSTRACT This research project concerns itself with a paradoxical experience of dislocation as a consistent experience of belonging through the increasing global phenomenon known as transnationalism. Central to this sense of non-belonging belonging are the temporal mediums of film and video. They are the key signifiers for locating my own familial connection to place through a family’s process of archiving stories through moving image. The paradoxical nature of this project {{suggests that it is}} through movement (moving image, moving homes) that an ontological experience of being “situated” is discovered. The project questions whether others who experience dislocation (whether they be termed transnationals or not), experience also a sense of belonging through the mediums of the image archive — and further, how this experience becomes articulated through spatial installation practice. This project employs or appropriates existing archival family moving-image footage that has been shot in various locations established as my ‘home’ at one time or another. It is layered with contemporary moving image footage to add a complexity around the question of location in relation to past, present and future situatedness. This work takes up the motif of the island as a topological and allegorical figure. It does so because three locations that establish my trajectory of home-life have been islands. Further, the Island acts allegorically as both a figure of ubiquity whereby islands are generally those spaces that signify floating lives, somehow resort/ing to a life disconnected from the proper flows of larger contemporary and continental progressive urban living. The Island for me becomes an establishing motif governed by water that surrounds it. Its milieu is water and in this sense the fluidity of this condition marks the paradoxical moment of my stability as consistency. This condition finds further currency through critical thinking such as Gilles Deleuze’s notion of the fold and Giorgio Agamben’s <b>Extra-territoriality.</b> Filmic practices such as Claire Denis and Philippe Grandrieux’s sensate cinema provide another conversation of shifting borders for material partipation with moving image. Artists, S. Neshat, Jonas Mekas, Christian Boltanski have concerns and conversations around home and displacement. And, it is H. Naficy that brings together the cinematic and exile as a theoretical question for transnationalism. Language becomes a key inscriptive device in the moving image installation, whereby there exists the hybrid and crypto language of Serbo-Croatian and English that give me my marker’s identity...|$|E
40|$|The {{provision}} {{of education has}} been a core function legitimizing the modern nation-state. Behind education one finds the building of citizenship, between demands for social cohesion and national identification, {{as well as the}} preparation of the labour force for the national economy. The moulding of a working education system remains a key challenge for new states and states emerging from armed conflict. Qualitative and quantitative scholarly literature exploring the causal relationship between education and civil war leaves no doubt about the salience of education systems in conflict-affected states. While a vast body of studies exists on education and violent conflict, less attention has been devoted to the role of education in peacebuilding and statebuilding. Above all, little research has been conducted into how externally promoted efforts at rebuilding education systems may affect (or fail to affect) the consolidation of peace. This study focuses on the ways in which a variety of international actors shape national education systems in states that have emerged out of armed conflict, and how these systems reflect and affect peacebuilding and statebuilding. From these premises, I have conducted fieldwork in Kosovo and East Timor, two recent cases where major statebuilding and peacebuilding interventions have been launched. The research first has mapped education programming and reform by identifying the main actors that {{have been part of the}} process. Second, I have conceptualized the ‘how’ and ‘why’ of these reforms by analysing primary source documents and interviewing key local and international stakeholders. Finally, after identifying the emerging forms of education systems, I have critically analysed the ways in which externally assisted education have reflected and affected processes of building the state and consolidating peace. The research has found that post-war reconstruction in both cases has led to the emergence of externally-driven and hybrid education systems whereby priorities are set in the intersection between local and international actors, often lacking coordination. Presenting features of <b>extra-territoriality</b> and denationalization, such education systems are a combination of global education policies and contextual local agendas. Rather than bringing the education system out of fragility, international interventions have determined and perpetuated a condition of dependency on international assistance. Humanitarian and stability imperatives have determined educational choices and priorities and education has neither addressed nor transformed root causes of the conflicts, missing the opportunity to contribute to social cohesion, change and justice. Overall, education has been a marginal sector within the broader political economy of peacebuilding and statebuilding, and a mere reflection of the principles and practices that underpin them. Rather than impacting on such processes, interventions in education in Kosovo and East Timor have reflected, legitimised and enhanced the prevailing models of peacebuilding and statebuilding, and in doing so, have incorporated their dilemmas, pitfalls and shortcomings. ...|$|E
