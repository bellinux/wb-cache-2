50|$|As wearing shoes {{has long}} been the usual <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance,</b> and going unshod has become {{inadequate}} and socially unaccepted, the semblance of bare feet was avoided by society and rarely seen. The disreputable assessment of displaying bare feet is connected to the tendency for slaves forced to remain shoeless to display their inferior societal rank while regular citizens usually refrained from this <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance</b> and resorted to footwear benefiting their social status. As a practical objective the omitted protection of the feet naturally implicated different environmental obstacles for the detained individuals, which restricted their freedom of action compared to shod individuals, attempts of prison escape were hereby made more difficult. Bare feet also complemented the force of physical restraints which were often applied in the form of shackles or similar devices. Prisoners were rendered more vulnerable to outside influences when they had to remain barefoot, therefore acts of physical resistance were frustrated or more easily overcome as well. As the results were achieved with little effort, this method was common practice to display the state of captivity in most civilizations of the past.|$|E
50|$|As {{shoes in}} their various {{appearances}} have been worn throughout all social classes since earliest human history, forcibly presenting {{a person to}} the public in bare feet usually conveys a shaming effect to the captive. The default of footwear is a customary symbol of subjugation and is, therefore, a common method to showcase a person's loss of status or absence of rights. As bare feet are a highly noticeable visual attribute in almost every social situation, this particular <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance</b> often incidentally raises suspicion or disdain among bystanders.|$|E
50|$|Beauty can {{be defined}} largely as a perception. It {{is a group of}} social norms that {{interpret}} a particular <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance</b> that is valued. Both men and women strive to achieve this beauty which influences them to shape themselves and alter their appearance in order to conform to those norms. These norms are largely derived from the medias presentation of models and well known stars through advertisements for products and magazine covers. As our society is now filled with these advertisements in all aspects of life, such as on TV, billboards, in supermarkets displayed with the products (particularly beauty products) and on social media, children are now viewing this material at a younger age and in turn creating the perception that this is the ideal appearance whilst they are still very impressionable.|$|E

50|$|Forcing {{people to}} go barefoot {{has been used as}} a {{relatively}} effortless and more subtle form of humiliation in most past and present civilized cultures, primarily using the visual contrast to the standard <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance</b> while also creating some level of physical discomfort. The exposure of bare feet often served as an indicator for imprisonment and slavery throughout ancient as well as modern history. Even today prisoners officially have to go barefoot in many countries of the world and are also presented in court and showcased to the public unshod.As shoes are commonly worn by all social classes since antiquity in most civilized societies, showcasing a captive to the public in bare feet traditionally symbolizes the person's loss of social standing and personal autonomy. It usually also causes a considerable degree of humiliation, as this noticeable detail typically sets the prisoner apart from spectators visually and demonstrates the person's vulnerability and general powerlessness.|$|E
50|$|In Topologie der Gewalt (Topology of Violence), Byung-Chul Han {{continues}} his alarming {{analysis of a}} society {{on the edge of}} collapse that he started with ›Müdigkeitsgesellschaft‹ (Fatigue Society). Focusing on the relation between violence and individuality, he shows, that albeit the widespread thesis about its disappearance, violence has only changed its <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance</b> and operates more subtly. The martial form of violence gives way to a more anonymous, desubjectified, systemic one, that does not reveal itself, as it is merging with its antagonist - freedom. Through Sigmund Freud, Walter Benjamin, Carl Schmitt, Richard Sennett, René Girard, Giorgio Agamben, Deleuze/Guattari, Michel Foucault, Michel Serres, Pierre Bourdieu and Martin Heidegger, Han approaches his own concept of violence, that finds to work in free individuality. Driven by the only demand to persevere and not to fail, {{as well as by the}} ambition of efficiency, we become committers and sacrificers at the same time and get into a swirl of demarcation, selfexploitation and collapse. Han's lucid study of violence offers plenty unorthodox thoughts and is not afraid of critical scrutinizing common in modern society concepts of freedom, individuality and self-fulfillment, bringing to light their shady sides.|$|E

5000|$|Shoes {{have been}} {{regarded}} as badges of freedom and signs of empowerment since early human history, while going barefoot designated a rather low social rank, often having the status of an unfree person. Using the symbolic meaning of shoes to display a respectable social status and also being vested with authority, people have ceremonially been issued with footwear as is mentioned in the bible [...] "But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, {{and put it on}} him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet (...) [...] ". Forcing individuals to go barefoot by taking away their shoes and disallowing or hindering them to be worn accordingly has the reversed meaning. While since ancient societies the standard <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance</b> commonly includes footwear as an implicit feature, the imagery or bare feet is often used to indicate submission, subjugation or dependence, in certain contexts also being disarmed or disempowered. Therefore, this detail has become an informal and sometimes even formal law in societies practicing slavery. A barefooted human could be unmistakably identified as unfree and be attributed with the lowest social status on the spot. As a consequence appearing barefooted in any social situation was proscribed for common citizens and strictly avoided. In many US states this perception is prevalent to this day as everyday shoes are typically also worn in the private space and being barefooted is effectively placed under taboo (see above).|$|E
5000|$|Rotterdam's {{paintings}} are generally abstract and mostly monochrome or reduced in color. Three-dimensionality {{is an important}} feature in his work with forms often protruding from the pictorial plane into actual space. The art critic Dore Ashton has written about his style: [...] "His vision of {{the mission of the}} painter is similar to the statement of Rainer Maria Rilke {{in a letter to his}} wife, not a reality that remain in dreams, intentions or moods, but their implementation in real things. Rotterdam is a modern painter (though he doubts its modernity) with images that represent closed, physical entities in themselves. He is forced to put his strong feelings in things." [...] From about 1980 Rotterdam became less minimalist and included more naturalistic forms.Konrad Paul Liessmann in Morbus Metaphysicus 5 : [...] " [...] Without doubt, the seriousness with which Paul Rotterdam’s paintings address the substance of things is directed less toward Nietzsche’s amoral Artist’s Metaphysics than towards concepts that seek a sui generis reality within a pictorial space. What sort of world is this, apprehended through a confrontation with art , that at first sight appears hermetic and only at second sight unveils a finely spun web of connections to the visible world ?" [...] " [...] The relationship of the modern artist to nature is characterized by an attempt to disregard the classical dictates of imitation and create instead a world beyond nature"."In a group of late works, Paul Rotterdam approaches with care and sensitivity a concept that includes both nature as the intrinsic condition of the work and nature as a reminder of a precognizant world. These pictures appear self-evident and mysterious in a forceful manner, impossible to classify as pure abstraction or described as representational in a mimetic sense. They certainly are not figurativ and the expressive element appears more as subtle gesture than as an emotional outburst. While these works depict no landscapes , something seems to be inscribed in their monochrome surfaces that evokes nature from a distance. Here is some grass barely moving in the wind , there a gentle curve of a hill, possibly a horizon, clearings warily coming into view , glints of reflecting water, an endless expanse of sky"." [...] The paintings of Paul Rotterdam lay a path to the phenomenon of nature so that art can find content without compromising its autonomy and natural quality."Alvin Martin in Paul Rotterdam’s new Romanticism 6: [...] "Rotterdam’s new acceptance of nature and history has also created for him a new philosophical attitude toward illusionistic space. Elements of illusionism have long been present in his work. Previously, however, these had been abstract allusions to his own spiritual voyage into an existential void , an eternity of nothingness. His new works still engage cosmic vastness , but now on a level of the romantic notion of the sublime. His metaphysical amalgamation of earth, plants, sky and water, punctuated by indications of temporal man-made things or myths , represents for him an eternal unity not only of man and nature but also of past,present and future. The artist gives himself and thus the viewer access to these mysterious landscapes of the spirit. The observer enters these images like some Berkelean perceiver, giving reality to these entities. He has produced images which are at once abstract, spiritual and humane".Joachim Roessl in L’equilibre mental 7: [...] " [...] I consider it to be at the least a very conservative interpretation, if the label of [...] "new romanticism" [...] (with a bridging link to C.D. Friedrich [...] ) is applied to Rotterdam’s work. Far more important are the positions formulated by Kandinsky and particularly Mondrian. That is where the point of departure lies for Rotterdam’s work. Kandinsky advocated formlessness, Mondrian favored rigid formalism. Both were of the opinion that the task of modern art was to reach the universal through the particular and thus to arrive at a view of the inner being of things. The aim was to overcome the exterior object world. By progressing into an interior zone, potentialities of expression previously inaccessible to painting are to be explored. [...] " [...] If you represent something that can be perceived through the senses, you express something human , because you know these things from within your own self. If you do not represent things, a space will remain for that which is divine". ( [...] Mondrian, Diary, 1914). How,then, are Rotterdam’s visual creations to be interpreted against this theoretical background, and what is their relation to Piet Mondrian’s work? Without a doubt, Rotterdam’s crucial concern is to view the essence of things through the medium of art. This is an attempt at objectification of the metaphysical, in order to make it communicable. Because behind every external <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>appearance</b> stands the reality of an inner essence. At its most extreme consequence, then, the picture is an expression of pure reality. Rotterdam, for this reason, often refers to his works as painting of the real. …..What is fascinating is the splendor of these picture plates as well as their poetic qualities… Rotterdam has carried out the crucial step towards a humanization of the art object. His works, while of a high intellectuality, can be experienced primarily emotionally. This in spite of their formal purism and indeed because of their lack of gestures. These images achieve their effect solely through their very clarity".Manfred Wagner in Paul Rotterdam 8 : [...] " [...] Paul Rotterdam’s thematic interest does not concentrate on representational content but on a substance principally understood as something three-dimensional, manifested or at least projected. His path of development leads from Klimt’s persuasive concept of flatness to the concept of the sublime in a literal sense rather than as a metaphor. Autonomy of the painting is sought by means of a self-contained system of form concerning the entire compass of the work rather than from the limited space within the frame. A visual structure is not only promoted as a new way of transforming nature, but also presents a challenge for the ongoing creation of paintings existing seemingly previous to the hand of the artist - an idea often embraced by African art. A painterly ambience is not the issue, but a psychic state, a kind of enlightenment caused by a pictorial structure unconcerned with figurative content." ...|$|E
