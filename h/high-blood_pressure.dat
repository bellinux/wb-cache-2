50|$|A {{serious or}} chronic illness {{can have an}} {{enormous}} effect on the biological drive and the psychological motivation for sexual desire and sexual behaviour. With poor health, an individual {{may be able to}} experience some desire but does not have the motivation or strength to have sex. Physical and mental well-being is crucial to successful and satisfying sexual expression. Chronic disorders like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, arthritis, enlarged prostates (in men), Parkinson's disease, and cancer can have negative influence over sexual desire, sexual functioning, and sexual response. In the case of diabetes, especially in men, there have been conflicting findings of the effect of the disease on sexual desire. Some studies have found that diabetic men have shown lower levels of sexual desire than healthy, age-matched counterparts. While other researchers have found no difference in level of sexual desire between diabetic men and healthy controls. <b>High-blood</b> <b>pressure</b> has also been found to be related to declining levels of sexual desire in men and women alike.|$|E

In May 2006 a report co-authored by James Banks of the Department of Economics was published which concluded that rates of diseases such as diabetes, lung cancer and <b>high-blood</b> <b>pressure</b> were up to twice as high among Americans aged between 55 and 64 as among English people of the same age group. Between 1997 and 2007 Lindsey Hughes was a Professor of Russian History at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies. In May 2009 a major report on the health risks posed by global warming co-authored by Mark Maslin, the director of the Environment Institute, was published. In January 2010 Simon Corcoran and Benet Salway of the History Department discovered fragments of the Gregorian Codex, an important Roman law code that previously had been thought lost forever.|$|E

40|$|In the United States, the {{prevalence}} of Latino older adults who are obese and suffer from chronic illnesses such as Diabetes, <b>High-Blood</b> <b>Pressure,</b> and Heart disease are a concerning factor to this community. This research study examines {{the prevalence}} of these conditions among the U. S. -born and Foreign-born Latinos residing in the United States using data collected from the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS). Independent variables examined were nativity, age, gender, and health practices such as physical exercising and vegetable consumption. Dependent variables examined were obesity (Body Mass Index (BMI)), and chronic illnesses such as diabetes, <b>high-blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> and heart disease. Results demonstrate that those individuals who self-rated their health very good or excellent had generally a lower BMI. There was significance between nativity and poor health, U. S. -born Latinos rated their health better than foreign-born Latinos. Elderly Latinos who had the most affluent groups were significantly less like to be diagnosed to have diabetes...|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe CONNECT study {{compared}} clinician {{adherence to}} guideline-recommended secondary prevention therapies prescribed at discharge for patients hospitalized for {{acute coronary syndrome}} (ACS) in those managed initially with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI; revascularized) {{and those who did}} not undergo revascularization. MethodsPatients aged greater than or equal to 18 years, hospitalized for a documented ST-segment elevation or non-ST-segment elevation ACS, were enrolled consecutively over 1 month at 238 sites in France. ResultsCompared with revascularized patients (n= 870), non-revascularized patients (n= 706) were significantly older, and a greater proportion were women, had <b>high-blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> type- 2 diabetes or a history of atherothrombotic or cardiac disease, but a smaller proportion had a history of coronary angioplasty. On discharge, non-revascularized patients were prescribed beta-blockers, aspirin, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or adenosine diphosphate receptor antagonists less frequently than revascularized patients. An adherence score greater than or equal to 80 % (at least four of the five recommended agents prescribed at discharge) was found in 96. 7 % of revascularized patients and 74. 4 % of non-revascularized patients (P< 0. 001). ConclusionsDespite a similar or even higher level of cardiovascular risk, non-revascularized ACS patients were prescribed guideline-recommended secondary prevention therapy less frequently than revascularized patients...|$|E
40|$|Adolescence {{period is}} a special period during which fastest growth and {{development}} occur in humans and which includes transition from childhood to adulthood. World Health Organization (WHO) define 10 - 19 age-group individuals as adolescence and 15 - 24 age-group individuals as youthood. That today’s community lacks knowledge of workout, inadequate awareness {{of the benefits of}} workout to human health and acceptance of the continuity of sedentary life gives rise to the incidence of lots of chronic diseases such as <b>high-blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> cardio-pulmonary diseases, obesity and diabetes. In recent years, childhood and adolescence obesity has become an important health problem {{as a result of the}} decline in physical activities. In this context, workout along with balanced diet is one of the precautions that can be suggested in terms of the prevention of obesity. The purpose of this study (compilation) is to provide information on keeping human health by means of an awareness of workout in adolescence period which is the most important stage preceding adulthood; to summarize the issue in relation to the written documents existing in the relevant literature, and to make suggestions about healthy future generations through workout in adolescence period. In conclusion, successful results regarding the treatment of obesity in adolescence can be achieved through aerobics along with low-calorie diet...|$|E
40|$|The general {{regimen of}} French {{healthcare}} (Régime général de l’assurance maladie) undertook a transversal study in 1994 using random selection with 2 % uniform stratification. The main {{objective was to}} measure the instantaneous “medico-social” prevalence of the thirty chronic diseases allowing exemption from patient co-payments (ALD 30). The overall sample, representative of all the ALD 30 diseases, was constituted by 66, 439 individuals. This study analysed a sample of 13, 145 mentally-ill patients {{in order to determine}} the prevalence of other somatic diseases also present and included in the list of disorders exempted from co-payments. In order to compare the prevalence of somatic disorders in the mentally-ill with that occurring in the overall population, the prevalence rates were age-adjusted. Diabetes, peripheral arterial diseases, <b>high-blood</b> <b>pressure,</b> severe respiratory failure and HIV infection are over-represented in the mentally-ill population. In contrast, the prevalence of rhumatoid arthritis and cancer are similar in the two populations (except for cancer in drug-addicts). We discuss a number of hypothesis for explaining the differences in prevalence of certain comorbities between mentally-ill patients and the overall population. Over-medicalization of the mentally-ill may explain an excess in the number of ALD 30 reported. This population, which is already exempt from making co-payments, may also under-report a concomittant, second disorder. Environmental and iatrogenic factors may also play a part in the morbid process. A reduction in their effects could improve the care given to mentally-ill patients...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: evaluate, through active call, {{lifestyles of}} an {{asymptomatic}} population {{in order to}} identify hyperglycaemic subjects and/or <b>high-blood</b> <b>pressure</b> sufferers to dispatch to their GP to perform suitable checking, and subjects to invite to a cardiovascular disease prevention programme because of their lifestyles. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: between January 2009 and July 2012, all healthy residents in the Local Health Authority of Este (ULSS 17 Este) aged 45 - 59 years were invited to join a cardiovascular disease prevention programme. DESIGN: all participants were evaluated through an administered lifestyle questionnaire. Parameters such as blood pressure (BP), glycaemia, waist circumference and body mass index were collected and recorded. Participants also received counseling, informational materials on lifestyle and were invited to individual or group health promotion initiatives in relation to personal risk factors. RESULTS: among the invited, 55. 5 % (3, 922 / 7, 071) adhered. Women (58. 8 %) responded significantly better than men (51. 9 %) (p < 0, 01). Subjects without risks factors were 16. 7 %. Subjects with lifestyle risk factors but normal BP and glycaemia were 49. 4 %, while those adding altered values for BP and glycaemia were 25. 2 %. The 8. 6 % of the respondents were not eligible for the study. CONCLUSIONS: the preliminary results suggest that a preventive programme based on the citizens active call by the Department of Prevention could be an effective tool to identify asymptomatic individuals with unknown hypertension and/or hyperglycaemia and to offer lifestyle interventions to lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases...|$|E
40|$|Information for Action # 2013 - 4 End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) {{is costly}} but preventable. End stage renal disease (ESRD) {{is the most}} severe stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in which the kidneys fail and {{treatment}} with dialysis or transplant is required. 1 • The incidence of ESRD in New York State (NYS) is more than ten times higher among people with diabetes than among the general population (Figure 1). • Diabetes and hypertension (<b>high-blood</b> <b>pressure)</b> are the leading causes of ESRD in NYS. In 2009, of the 6, 967 new cases of ESRD, 42 % (N = 2, 903) were due to diabetes and 25 % (N = 1, 780) were due to hypertension (Figure 2). • In 2008, the per-member, per-year costs for NYS Medicaid enrollees with diabetes and ESRD were approximately $ 65, 200, compared to $ 16, 400 for members with diabetes alone and $ 9, 400 for members without either condition. 2 Improving blood sugar control and lowering blood pressure and cholesterol can prevent CKD and avoid its costly progression to ESRD. 3, 4 Early assessment and treatment of CKD increases {{the success of these}} prevention strategies. However, awareness of CKD among adults with diabetes and primary care providers is low. In one study of adults at high risk for CKD, including those with diabetes, awareness was less than 10 %. Research in primary care has shown that less than 20 % of providers document CKD assessment in patient medical records. 5 Rate per 100, 000 populatio...|$|E
40|$|In this {{installment}} of our ongoing Statistics to English Translation series 1, {{we will look}} at the technical meaning of the term ”significant”. As you might expect, what it means in statistics is not exactly what it means in everyday language. Does too much salt cause high blood pressure, or doesn’t it? That debate has raged for decades, with a slew of studies finding “yes ” and a slew of others finding “no. ” Two new studies out today in the journal Hypertension tip the scales in favor of reducing sodium – particularly for those 1 in 4 Americans who have high blood pressure. One study found that reducing salt intake from 9, 700 milligrams a day to 6, 500 milligrams decreased blood pressure significantly in blacks, Asians, and whites who had untreated mild hypertension. Another study found that switching to a lower-salt diet helped lower blood pressure in folks with treatment-resistant hypertension. – “ 10 salt shockers that could make hypertension worse, ” U. S. News & World Report [Kot 09] “Great! ” you think. “Who needs to spend money on <b>high-blood</b> <b>pressure</b> meds? I can just cut down my salt! ” Well, maybe so, maybe not. To come to that conclusion, you need more information than you were given in that paragraph. What was the “significant ” decrease in blood pressure? What was the “before ” and the “after”? Does “significant ” mean important, or useful? And why has there been so much controversy over this? Let’s discuss the important points with an example...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the impact of}} Primary Health Care (PHC) nursing workforce characteristics and of the clinical practice environment (CPE) perceived by nurses on the control of <b>high-blood</b> <b>pressure</b> (HBP). Design: Cross-sectional analytical study. Setting: Administrative and clinical registries of hypertensive patients from PHC information systems and questionnaire from PHC nurses. Participants: 76 797 hypertensive patients in two health zones within the Community of Madrid, North- West Zone (NWZ) with a higher socioeconomic situation and South-West Zone (SWZ) with a lower socioeconomic situation, and 442 reference nurses. Segmented analyses by area were made due to their different socioeconomic characteristics. Primary outcome measure: Poor HBP control (adequate figures below the value 140 / 90 mm Hg) associated with {{the characteristics of the}} nursing workforce and selfperceived CPE. Results: The prevalence of poor HBP control, estimated by an empty multilevel model, was 33. 5 % (95 % CI 31. 5 % to 35. 6 %). In the multilevel multivariate regression models, the perception of a more favourable CPE was associated with a reduction in poor control in NWZ men and SWZ women (OR= 0. 99 (95 % CI 0. 98 to 0. 99)); the economic immigration conditions increased poor control in NWZ women (OR= 1. 53 (95 % CI 1. 24 to 1. 89)) and in SWZ, both men (OR= 1. 89 (95 % CI 1. 43 to 2. 51)) and women (OR= 1. 39 (95 % CI 1. 09 to 1. 76)). In all four models, increasing the annual number of patient consultations was associated with a reduction in poor control (NWZ women: OR= 0. 98 (95 % CI 0. 98 to 0. 99); NWZ men: OR= 0. 98 (95 % CI 0. 97 to 0. 99); SWZ women: OR= 0. 98 (95 % CI 0. 97 to 0. 99); SWZ men: OR= 0. 99 (95 % CI 0. 97 to 0. 99). Conclusions: A CPE, perceived by PHC nurses as more favourable, and more patient–nurse consultations, contribute to better HBP control. Economic immigration condition is a risk factor for poor HBP control.
