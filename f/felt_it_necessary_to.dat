5|$|Since the {{founding}} of Freemasonry, many Bishops of the Church of England have been Freemasons, such as Archbishop Geoffrey Fisher. In the past, few members of the Church of England would have seen any incongruity in concurrently adhering to Anglican Christianity and practising Freemasonry. In recent decades, however, reservations about Freemasonry have increased within Anglicanism, perhaps due to the increasing prominence of the evangelical wing of the church. The former Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, appeared to harbour some reservations about Masonic ritual, whilst being anxious to avoid causing offence to Freemasons {{inside and outside the}} Church of England. In 2003 he <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> apologise to British Freemasons after he said that their beliefs were incompatible with Christianity and that he had barred the appointment of Freemasons to senior posts in his diocese when he was Bishop of Monmouth.|$|E
5|$|By 360, Gaul was {{sufficiently}} secure to permit Julian to despatch reinforcements of about 3,000 men under magister armorum Lupicinus to Britain, which {{had suffered a}} serious land and sea invasion by the Picts of Caledonia (Scotland) and the Scoti of Hibernia (Ireland). But at the same time, Julian received a demand from Constantius, who {{was unaware of the}} British expedition, that he send 4 auxilia palatina regiments plus select squadrons of cavalry (about 2,500 men) under Lupicinus to the East as reinforcements for the war against the Persians. This triggered a near-mutiny by Julian's soldiers, who again proclaimed him Augustus. He again refused, but this time, the troops insisted, making it clear they would mutiny if he refused and march against Constantius with or without him. Alarmed, but also secretly pleased, Julian accepted the title and wrote an apologetic letter to Constantius explaining why he had <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> bow to his soldiers' wishes and requesting his ratification. But this was refused by Constantius, who replied demanding that Julian revert to Caesar status. Julian ignored the order, but to prove his good faith and also to keep his near-mutinous troops occupied, he crossed the Rhine and attacked the Attuarii tribe of the Frankish confederation.|$|E

5|$|Bagramyan's 11th Guards Army (the renamed 16th Army) was tasked to {{take part}} in the {{offensive}} and was given an additional three infantry divisions and two tank corps, a force composed of fifteen divisions. Bagramyan, however, argued to STAVKA that its planning was too audacious in the hopes of repeating a successful encirclement like that in Uranus. He claimed that his forces would be overstretched and would have difficulty in attacking the entrenched German positions in Bolkhov. To avoid a repetition of the failure in Kharkov the previous year, he instead asked that the 61st Army from the Bryansk Front aid his 11th Guards in destroying the German forces in Bolkhov, thus eliminating the Ninth Army's protection from the north. He appealed to his front commander Vasily Sokolovsky as well the Bryansk's M. A. Reyter, both of whom rejected his proposal. In April, STAVKA recalled the main commanders of the Fronts and Armies to Moscow on a briefing of the preparations for the battle. Against the protestations of Sokolovsky and Reyter, Bagramyan proposed his alternative plan to Stalin, who agreed that it would be the more correct course to follow. Bagramyan was given twenty days to prepare the 11th Guards Army and on 24 May reported that his forces were ready. The 11th Guards now was composed of 135,000 men, 280 armored fighting vehicles, 2,700 artillery pieces and several hundred planes to lend air support for the ground forces. Stalin, however, <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> further wear thin the fighting abilities of the German forces and delayed the offensive.|$|E
5|$|When {{thinking}} {{on how to}} write about true love, Akahori considered laughingly that in normal relationships between boys and girls, it eventually tends towards having sex. In order to avoid this, he chose to have a cast of female main characters, but he felt that audiences have experienced this before and that it thus would not be enough. This is when he thought {{up the idea of}} changing the main character from a boy to a girl. Akahori knew this would be a problem, since normally changing a person's gender would cause complications, one of them being that the now-female character would invariably want to return to being male. He knew that there were a few problems that could not be avoided, but he wanted to remove the desire to turn back into a male. For this reason, Akahori devised that the character would not want to turn back into a male if there was the impact of the entire world already having accepted the fact that his gender had changed. To do this, Akahori decided to have the alien who crashed into the character to not only revive the character as a female, but to broadcast this over the entire world, which is what happens at the beginning of Kashimashi. Afterwards, Akahori <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> expand on the alien's role in the story. At this point in the development process, Akahori felt he could now begin writing the story.|$|E

Almodóvar had already written the script for Dark Habits and was hesitant to cast Pascaul in the leading role due to her limited acting experience.

25|$|The Portuguese {{brought to}} India a {{particularly}} militant brand of Christianity, {{the product of}} several centuries of struggle during the Reconquista, which they hoped to spread across the world. Facilitating this objective was the Padroado Real, a series of treaties and decrees in which the Pope conferred upon the Portuguese government certain authority in ecclesiastical matters in the foreign territories they conquered. Upon reaching India the Portuguese quickly ensconced themselves in Goa and established a church hierarchy; soon they set themselves to bringing the native Christians under their dominion. Towards this goal, the colonial establishment <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> conduct the Saint Thomas Christians fully into the Latin Rite, both in bringing them into conformity with Latin church customs and in subjecting them {{to the authority of}} the Archbishop of Goa.|$|E

25|$|In both Deuteronomy 23:3, and Zechariah 9:6, the Hebrew word mamzer is {{referenced}} {{alongside the}} nations of Ammon and Moab (in Deut 23:3), and the Philistine cities of Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron and Ashdod (in Zech 9:5–6). From such, Karaites have come to consider the most logical understanding of the Hebrew word mamzer, which modern Rabbinical Jews understand to refer to either children born from adultery or from incest (Talmud Bavli, Masekhet Yevamot), to actually speak of a nation or people. Karaites think that such an understanding fits perfectly into the context of both Deuteronomy 23 and Zechariah 9, (and {{this was also the}} understanding of the Rabbinist commentator Yehudah ben Shemu’el ibn Bil‘am). Several Medieval Rabbinite Jewish sages <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> debate this topic with Medieval Karaite Jewish sages.|$|E

An anonymous survey conducted by Wolfire for those who <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> acquire the second Bundle from other illegitimate sources showed that some preferred the option of using peer-to-peer sharing services like BitTorrent to improve the speed and reliability of the download; as a result, Wolfire added the option to download the games through BitTorrent, hoping to entice more people to acquire the game legitimately.|$|E
25|$|The Karonga War was {{minor in}} terms of combatants and {{casualties}} compared to the First or Second Matabele War in Southern Rhodesia but its major significance {{for the history of}} Malawi, particularly the north of the country, was that it forced a change in British government policy.

Like the roughly contemporaneous Abushiri revolt in German East Africa, it represented the end of any political influence of Swahili traders acknowledging the Sultan of Zanzibar’s authority in East and Central Africa, and the end of attempts of Chartered companies to assume or retain control in place of their home governments.|$|E

25|$|Injuries {{to other}} players {{resulted}} in another recall to the England side for the Third Test against New Zealand at Headingley in July 1965, where he scored 310 not out. This innings spanned over eight hours, and included 52 fours and five sixes – 238 runs or 77% of his innings.

Though, when England faced South Africa later in the tour, Peters was not selected. New Zealand rugby teams in particular had done this, and the exclusion of George Nepia and Jimmy Mill from the 1928 All Blacks tour, and the dropping of Ranji Wilson from the New Zealand Army team nine years before that, had attracted little comment at the time.
