5|$|Luminous {{infrared}} galaxies or LIRGs are galaxies with luminosities, {{the measurement}} of brightness, above 1011 L☉. LIRGs are more abundant than starburst galaxies, Seyfert galaxies and quasi-stellar objects at comparable total luminosity.

5|$|Observation of Neptune in the {{radio-frequency}} band {{shows that}} it is a source of both continuous emission and irregular bursts.

5|$|The {{application}} of Blender was supplemented {{by use of}} the IRAC instrument on the Spitzer Space Telescope, which was used on August 30 and November 15, 2010, to further define Kepler-10's light curve {{at the point where}} KOI 072.02 appeared to transit it. It was found that the transiting object did not produce a color, an aspect that is characteristic of stars. This suggested even further that KOI 072.02 was a planet. In addition, the IRAC instrument found no difference in the transit signal when comparing the star's light curve <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>infrared</b> and in visible light; stars that are aligned with Kepler-10 might appear visibly similar, but would appear different <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>infrared.</b>|$|E

5|$|Dust {{particles}} tend {{to stick}} {{to each other in}} the dense disk environment, leading to the formation of larger particles up to several centimeters in size.

Planetesimal formation is another unsolved problem of disk physics, as simple sticking becomes ineffective as dust particles grow larger.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} is to study the changes occurring {{on the surface of}} poplar wood exposed to artificial irradiation in a Solar Box. Colour changes were monitored with a reflectance spectrophotometer. Surface chemical modifications were evaluated by measuring <b>the</b> <b>infrared</b> spectra. Hyperspectral imaging was also applied to study the surface wood changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> visible-near <b>infrared</b> and <b>the</b> short wave <b>infrared</b> wavelength ranges. <b>The</b> data obtained from the different techniques were compared to find <b>the</b> possible correlations <b>in</b> order to evaluate the applicability of the Hyperspectral imaging to investigate wood modifications in a non-invasive modality. The study of colour changes showed an important variation due to photo-irradiation which is the greatest change occurring within the first 24 hours. Infrared spectroscopy revealed that lignin degrades mainly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first 48 hours. Concerning Hyperspectral imaging, <b>the</b> spectral features <b>in</b> <b>the</b> visible-near <b>infrared</b> range are mainly linked to the spectral shape, whereas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> short wave <b>infrared</b> cellulose and lignin affect shape and reflectance levels. The proposed approach showed that a correlation can be established between colour variation and wood degradation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> visible-near <b>infrared</b> range; furthermore <b>in</b> <b>the</b> short wave <b>infrared</b> region surface chemical changes can be assessed. © 2013 Giorgia Agresti et al...|$|R
50|$|Unlike many {{traditional}} astronomical challenges, {{the most serious}} challenge for these missions is not gathering enough photons from the faint planet, but rather detecting a faint planet that is extremely close to a very bright star. For a terrestrial planet, the contrast ratio of planet to its host stars is approximately ~10−6-10−7 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thermal <b>infrared</b> or ~10−9-10−10 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> optical/near <b>infrared.</b> For this reason, Darwin and Terrestrial Planet Finder-I will work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thermal <b>infrared.</b> However, searching for terrestrial planets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> optical/near <b>infrared</b> has <b>the</b> advantage that the diffraction limit corresponds to a smaller angle for a given size telescope. Therefore, NASA is also pursuing a Terrestrial Planet Finder-C mission that will search for and study terrestrial planets using the optical (and near infrared) wavelengths. While Terrestrial Planet Finder-C aims to study the light of extrasolar planets, Darwin and Terrestrial Planet Finder-I will search for thermal infrared light that is reradiated (rather than scattered) by the planet.|$|R

5|$|With the {{exception}} of infrared wavelengths close to visible light, such radiation is heavily absorbed by the atmosphere, or masked, as the atmosphere itself produces significant infrared emission. Consequently, infrared observatories have to be located in high, dry places on Earth or in space. Some molecules radiate strongly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>infrared.</b> This allows {{the study of the}} chemistry of space; more specifically it can detect water in comets.|$|E
5|$|A unique {{window on}} the Universe enabled by Hubble are the Hubble Deep Field, Hubble Ultra-Deep Field, and Hubble Extreme Deep Field images, which used Hubble's {{unmatched}} sensitivity at visible wavelengths to create images of small patches of sky that are the deepest ever obtained at optical wavelengths.

5|$|An owl's {{eyes are}} {{placed at the}} front of the head and have a field overlap of 50–70%, giving it better {{binocular}} vision than diurnal birds of prey (overlap 30–50%). The tawny owl's retina has about 56,000 light-sensitive rod cells per square millimetre (36million per square inch); although earlier claims that it could see <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>infrared</b> part of the spectrum have been dismissed, it is still often said to have eyesight 10 to 100 times better than humans in low-light conditions. However, the experimental basis for this claim is probably inaccurate by at least a factor of 10. The owl's actual visual acuity is only slightly greater than that of humans, and any increased sensitivity is due to optical factors rather than to greater retinal sensitivity; both humans and owl have reached the limit of resolution for the retinas of terrestrial vertebrates.|$|E

5|$|Astronomers may {{be close}} to solving this mystery. They noticed a large plume of gas {{extending}} at least six times its stellar radius indicating that Betelgeuse is not shedding matter evenly in all directions. The plume's presence implies that the spherical symmetry of the star's photosphere, often observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>infrared,</b> is not preserved in its close environment. Asymmetries on the stellar disk had been reported at different wavelengths. However, due to the refined capabilities of the NACO adaptive optics on the VLT, these asymmetries have come into focus. The two mechanisms that could cause such asymmetrical mass loss, were large-scale convection cells or polar mass loss, possibly due to rotation. Probing deeper with ESO's AMBER, gas in the supergiant's extended atmosphere has been observed vigorously moving up and down, creating bubbles {{as large as the}} supergiant itself, leading his team to conclude that such stellar upheaval is behind the massive plume ejection observed by Kervella.|$|E
5|$|Because {{germanium}} is transparent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>infrared</b> wavelengths, it is {{an important}} infrared optical material that can be readily cut and polished into lenses and windows. It is especially used as the front optic in thermal imaging cameras working in the 8 to 14micron range for passive thermal imaging and for hot-spot detection in military, mobile night vision, and fire fighting applications. It is used in infrared spectroscopes and other optical equipment that require extremely sensitive infrared detectors. It has a very high refractive index (4.0) and must be coated with anti-reflection agents. Particularly, a very hard special antireflection coating of diamond-like carbon (DLC), refractive index 2.0, is a good match and produces a diamond-hard surface that can withstand much environmental abuse.|$|E
