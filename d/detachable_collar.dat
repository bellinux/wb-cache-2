25|$|A <b>detachable</b> <b>collar</b> is {{a collar}} {{separate}} from the shirt, fastened to the shirt by studs. Hannah Lord Montague invented the <b>detachable</b> <b>collar</b> in Troy, New York in 1827, after she snipped the collar off one of her husband's shirts to wash it, and then sewed it back on.|$|E
25|$|Shirts {{designed}} to take a <b>detachable</b> <b>collar</b> have a tunic collar, which is a low standing band of fabric around the neck, with a hole at {{the front and back}} for the collar studs.|$|E
25|$|The School {{is known}} for its traditions, {{including}} a uniform of black tailcoat (or morning coat) and waistcoat, false-collar and pinstriped trousers. Most pupils wear a white tie that is effectively a strip of cloth folded over into a starched, <b>detachable</b> <b>collar,</b> but some senior boys are entitled to wear a white bow tie and winged collar ("Stick-Ups"). There are some variations in the school dress worn by boys in authority, see School Prefects and King's Scholars sections.|$|E
50|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, Troy's garment {{industries}} produced over 90% of America's <b>detachable</b> <b>collars</b> {{and many}} of its finest shirts.|$|R
50|$|Outside these situations, <b>detachable</b> <b>collars</b> {{are less}} common. Stiff collars in {{particular}} with daywear {{in the 21st century}} are generally rare, but if one is worn, it is usually a turndown collar, though morning dress is seen still with a wing collar. Older styles, such as the imperial collar (a high collar with no wings last popular with the Edwardians), are not frequently seen now. A more common use of <b>detachable</b> <b>collars</b> is with eveningwear, in which case a high wing collar is worn in America although turn-down collars are preferred for black-tie in Britain as per Edward VII.|$|R

25|$|Christofle Charvet {{created the}} first shirtmaker store in Paris, for which the new term chemisier (shirtmaker) was coined. Previously, shirts were {{generally}} made by linen keepers with fabric provided by the customer, but in this store of a new kind, clients were measured, fabric selected and shirts made on site. The development of this specialty trade was favored by a change in men's fashion, with more importance given to the waistcoat and the shirt collar, which called for more propositions for the shirt front and a technical change. Previously, shirts were cut by linen keepers entirely of rectangles and squares. There were no shaping seams and no need for shirt patterns. The new interest for a closer fitting shirt led to curving the armhole and neckline or adding a shoulder yoke, by application to the shirt of tailoring techniques. The new kind of shirt was called chemise à pièce (yoked shirt). Alan Flusser credits Christofle Charvet with the original design of a collar that could be turned down or folded, much {{in the manner of}} contemporary collars, and the concept of the <b>detachable</b> <b>collar.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{stage was}} set for Troy's industrialization. The {{development}} of the <b>detachable</b> <b>collar</b> by Hannah Lord Montague in 1827 had given the city the product that still lends it its [...] "Collar City" [...] nickname. Plants were built to manufacture them commercially, as well as cuffs and other textile products. Most of these were located {{to the north of}} the downtown area, as it was continuing to grow as the city's commercial district and residential area for the well-to-do of the time along Second Street.|$|E
2500|$|A day {{dress shirt}} is fairly {{similar to a}} normal shirt, and is usually white, with a stiff <b>detachable</b> <b>collar,</b> though other designs, such as a {{vertical}} blue stripe, are also appropriate. [...] Double cuffs are most common. This sort of shirt is also conventionally worn by some barristers and judges.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Detachable</b> <b>collars</b> {{are often}} used by barristers in the UK, Ireland and Canada, many of whom wear a winged collar when in court to allow the use of bands. On the way to and from court, a {{turndown}} collar and tie is worn. Another common use of <b>detachable</b> <b>collars</b> now is a clerical collar (or [...] "Roman Collar"), though these are now often made from flexible plastic for ease of washing, and are not always now attached in the traditional way with studs. Also, at Eton College, all pupils wear stiff collars, mostly turndown collars, while students in positions of authority wear 'stick-ups', which includes a wing collar.|$|R
25|$|There {{are various}} styles of collar, {{which is the}} primary {{indicator}} of the formality of a shirt. Those discussed here are all attached collars, not styles specific to <b>detachable</b> <b>collars.</b> The very top button is number 1.|$|R
2500|$|In British English, [...] "dress shirt" [...] ("formal shirts," [...] or [...] "tuxedo shirts" [...] in American English) means {{specifically}} the more formal evening garment worn with black- or white-tie. Some of these formal shirts have stiff fronts and <b>detachable</b> <b>collars</b> attached with collar studs.|$|R
2500|$|Proper {{accessories}} to wear {{with the}} frock coat included a non-collapsible top {{hat and a}} boutonnière in the lapel. A Homburg hat was considered too informal to wear with proper formal morning dress. During the Victorian and Edwardian era, button boots with a single row of punching across the cap toe were worn along with a cane. [...] On cold days, it was common to wear a frock overcoat, a type of overcoat cut {{exactly the same as}} the frock coat, with the waist seam construction, only a little longer and fuller to permit it to be worn {{over the top of the}} frock coat. Patent leather dress boots were worn up until the Edwardian era with morning dress. The practice of wearing patent leather shoes is today reserved strictly for evening formalwear. [...] Trousers are uncuffed and worn with braces (suspenders in American English) to avoid the top of the trousers from showing underneath the waistcoat. Only white shirts were worn with frock coats. The shirt was worn with a standing <b>detachable</b> <b>collar.</b> The most standard neckwear was a formal cravat (or Ascot in American English). The cravat was tied in the Ascot knot (the entire cravat is called an Ascot in American English) characterised by way the ends cross over in front, or alternatively in a Ruche knot, tied like a four-in-hand knot of a modern necktie. A decorative cravat pin often adorned with a precious stone or pearl was used to keep the cravat tidy. The cravat was usual with a frock coat when worn in more formal occasions through the Victorian and Edwardian eras, although the long necktie came to be worn increasingly after the turn of the century in the same manner as it is today with morning dress. The practice of wearing bow ties as an acceptable alternative with formalwear fell away after the late Victorian to early Edwardian era and became relegated to eveningwear, as remains the case in the twenty-1st century. As with a formal shirt for white tie, cuffs were single (rather than double) cuffed and made to close with cufflinks. The waistcoat was usually double-breasted with double-breasted style (or peaked) lapels. Formal gloves in light grey suede, chamois, or kid leather were also required.|$|E

5000|$|Some [...] {{believe that}} Hannah Montague invented this collar in Troy, New York, in 1827, after she snipped off the collar {{from one of}} her husband's shirts to wash it, and then sewed it back on. The Rev. Ebenezar Brown, a {{businessman}} in town, proceeded to commercialize it. The manufacture of <b>detachable</b> <b>collars</b> and the associated shirts became a significant industry in Troy.|$|R

2500|$|Contrast collar shirts are {{occasionally}} made, {{which are}} white collars on a coloured or patterned shirt. [...] These are worn {{for a variety}} of reasons, such as to offset certain complexions; because of a tradition started by <b>detachable</b> <b>collars,</b> where it is impractical to have many collars in different matching colours; and finally because when a collar is replaced it is unlikely an exact colour match will be found. These collars are generally considered more formal than matching fabric.|$|R
50|$|A <b>detachable</b> <b>collar</b> is a shirt collar {{separate}} from the shirt, fastened to it by studs. The collar is usually made of a different fabric from the shirt, in which case it is almost always white, and, being unattached to the shirt, can be specially starched to a hard cardboard-like consistency.|$|E
5000|$|The {{style of}} shirt was also worn by working-class {{men in the}} United Kingdom during the {{industrial}} era. At this period, {{the lack of a}} turndown or collar [...] "cape" [...] was filled by the use of a <b>detachable</b> <b>collar.</b> The 2010s decade has also seen the garment feature as a mainstream fashion item for men.|$|E

50|$|The {{invention}} of the dickey {{was to make the}} bosom front of a full dress shirt a separate entity in itself, like the <b>detachable</b> <b>collar,</b> so it could be laundered and starched more easily than a traditional shirt with the bosom attached. The use of the dickey was considered bad style by traditionalists and had fallen out of use. Shirts with an attached bosom are now rare in themselves since traditional evening dress is no longer regularly worn.|$|E
50|$|If {{the shirt}} has turn-down collars it usually has sleeves with double cuffs {{fastened}} with cufflinks as standard. If a wing collar is worn {{it should be}} with a single cuff shirt {{as in the past}} a starched stiff fronted shirt was worn with the cuffs also starched stiff as well as a starched detachable wing collar, worn with cufflinks and shirt studs (essentially, the same as the full evening dress shirt). Contemporary shirts often do not have a <b>detachable</b> <b>collar</b> at all.|$|E
50|$|Clerical {{waistcoat}} or rabat: Clerical waistcoats or rabats are {{the most}} traditional and formal item of clerical costume. They are almost always black and are made of worsted wool. Clerical waistcoats generally sport silk backing. They are worn over a neckband shirt and a <b>detachable</b> <b>collar</b> to create a cassock-like appearance about the neck. Unlike the waistcoats that accompany suits, they button {{all the way to}} the collar. The rabat is a late innovation, and exactly mirrors the clerical waistcoat, except that it is backless.|$|E
