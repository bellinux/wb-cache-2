40|$|Great Depression is {{an example}} of a {{macroeconomic}} crisis that produced adverse economic and social effects in all spheres of life. Theoretical arguments about the real effects of the Great Depression on education vary. First is economic hardships, which might force individuals eligible to go to school to work instead.

Following these theoretical notions, this paper explores the impact of the Great Depression on education, on race (whites and blacks) and gender (males and females), during the period 1930 - 1940. Furthermore, I test the effects of state <b>employment</b> <b>indices</b> on education.

50|$|Although the World Bank {{does not}} believe that laissez-faire policies, if they allow large inequalities of wealth to develop, are an {{effective}} way to achieve this goal, it is a strong supporter of the importance of economic growth for reducing poverty. It argues that an overview of many studies shows that: growth is fundamental for poverty reduction, and in principle growth as such does not seem to affect inequality, growth accompanied by a more egalitarian distribution of wealth is better than growth alone, high initial income inequality is a brake on poverty reduction, poverty itself is also likely to be a barrier for poverty reduction, and wealth inequality seems to predict lower future growth rates. In 2011 the IMF Economic Review published an article that found countries with higher economic freedom and more liberal credit market regulation suffered more in output growth during the late-2000s financial crisis. In 2014 a working paper published by the International Labour Organization said some of the methodology used in the Rigidity of <b>Employment</b> <b>index</b> sub-components, was not useful.|$|E

The theoretical arguments about the real effects of the Great Depression on education vary.

40|$|Personal {{consumption}} expenditures {{accounted for}} some 70 percent of GDP {{prior to the}} Great Recession. The normal role of consumers in U.

Much {{of the increase in}} consumer spending was fueled by greater use of debt, through new forms of leverage such as low cost loans secured by home equity. During the recent recession, two forces combined for a perfect storm: the first was untested financial innovation (subprime mortgages) leveraging the second, an asset bubble (housing markets). In addition, revolving credit card borrowing peaked in mid- 2008.
