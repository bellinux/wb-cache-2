5|$|After Charles II was {{restored}} to the throne in 1660, Eyre was dismissed and replaced by Edward Strange. The future of the castle was uncertain; Charles gave orders to demobilise the <b>garrison</b> and briefly considered having the fortress demolished altogether. Instead of maintaining a regular <b>garrison,</b> in 1666 {{it was decided to}} staff the castle using soldiers deployed from the Isle of Wight instead, from a unit belonging to Sir Robert Holmes, the island's governor. Hurst had meanwhile fallen into disrepair, delaying the plans to deploy Holmes' men until 1671. Repairs were carried out and, by 1675, a conventional <b>garrison</b> and almost thirty guns were stationed at Hurst.|$|E

Parker and Stone said they {{went out of their way}} to include the {{reference}} due to their own strong distaste for the film.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the English Civil War in 1642, {{fighting}} broke out around Portsmouth between the Royalist forces, led by Colonel George Goring, and Parliamentarians under the command of Colonel Richard Norton. Southsea Castle was held by the Royalist Captain Challoner, supported by a small <b>garrison</b> of eleven men and 14 guns, and Norton decided to attack the fortification with 400 infantry and two troops of cavalry. The assault took place at {{in the early hours of}} the morning on 5 September; the <b>garrison</b> had positioned their guns to point inland, so the attackers stormed the moat on the seaward side. They then demanded that the <b>garrison</b> surrender but Challoner, who had been drinking heavily with Goring the night before, refused to discuss this and asked them to return later in the day. A fresh assault began and the <b>garrison</b> surrendered without loss of life. The capture of the castle meant left Portsmouth's position untenable and the town surrendered. A significant Parliamentarian <b>garrison</b> was then installed in the castle to keep it from being retaken.|$|E
5|$|By early 1645 the war {{had turned}} decisively against the King, and in February, Parliamentary forces seized the county town of Shrewsbury. This exposed {{the rest of the}} region to attack, and in June a force of 800 Parliamentary {{soldiers}} pushed south towards Ludlow, attacking Stokesay en route. The Royalist <b>garrison,</b> led by Captain Daurett, was heavily outnumbered {{and it would have been}} impossible for them to effectively defend the new gatehouse, which was essentially ornamental. Nonetheless, both sides complied with the protocols of warfare at the time, resulting in a bloodless victory for the Parliamentary force: the besiegers demanded that the <b>garrison</b> surrender, the <b>garrison</b> refused, the attackers demanded a surrender for a second time, and this time the <b>garrison</b> were able to give up the castle with dignity.|$|E

5|$|During the {{off-season}} Vancouver signed defenceman Jason <b>Garrison</b> to a six-year contract worth $27.6 million. While the Canucks brought in <b>Garrison,</b> they lost longtime defenceman Sami Salo. The Canucks wanted to re-sign Salo, {{though they were}} unwilling to sign him to a two-year contract and offered only a one-year deal. Salo chose to leave and signed a two-year $7.5 million contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning. It was believed that <b>Garrison</b> would step in {{and contribute to the}} power play and replace the departed Salo, who had performed a similar role. However, he struggled to adjust with his new team. He was taken off the power play unit and dropped to the third pairing within the first month. After the injuries to Bieksa, <b>Garrison</b> was moved from left defenceman to the right side pairing with Dan Hamhuis. The coaching staff came to consider this pairing to be the best and most trusted. <b>Garrison</b> finished the season with eight goals and eight assists, scoring three goals and three assists on the power play, and registering a +18 rating. His plus-minus was second on the team and led all defenceman.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{returned}} to the castle from Leicester in September, where another 600 Royalist soldiers soon joined him and its 60 man <b>garrison,</b> carrying out raids on Parliamentary convoys and the <b>garrison</b> at Coleorton. Plague broke {{out at the end}} of the year, forcing the besiegers to retreat to Leicester, while the <b>garrison</b> temporarily abandoned the castle buildings and occupied the neighbouring park. Once the epidemic passed, Parliament began to raid the town and Henry worked through Ferdinando to agree the surrender of the castle on good terms: this was achieved in February 1646, and allowed for the release of himself, the <b>garrison</b> and their weapons.|$|E

5|$|Most residents, {{including}} the mayor, supported the parliamentarians during the English Civil War, although its military governor, Colonel Goring, supported the royalists. The town {{became a major}} base for the parliamentarian navy and was blockaded from the sea. Parliamentarian troops were sent to raid it by land in the Siege of Portsmouth; the guns of Southsea Castle were fired at the royalist <b>garrison</b> in the town. Across the harbour, parliamentarians in Gosport joined in the assault, with their guns damaging St Thomas's Church. On 5September 1642, the remaining royalists in the <b>garrison</b> at the Square Tower were forced to surrender after Goring threatened to blow it up with gunpowder. In return, he and his <b>garrison</b> were allowed safe passage.|$|E

5|$|Parliament {{maintained}} a <b>garrison</b> at the castle, but in 1647 it cut {{the levels of}} the armed forces across the country; most soldiers who lost their posts were offered two months pay, but at Pendennis only one month's pay was offered. The <b>garrison,</b> led by Colonel Richard Fortescue, mutinied, seized the visiting Parliamentary commissioners and refused to leave the castle until the additional pay was granted to them. Fearing a wider uprising, Parliament negotiated an end to the confrontation, paying off the <b>garrison</b> in full and offering Fortescue fresh employment elsewhere. A smaller, more reliable <b>garrison</b> was then installed. During the interregnum, the castle was used to imprison the radical pamphleteer William Prynne.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{appointment}} of Abu-Ubaidah as commander in chief, he sent a small detachment to the annual fair held at Abu-al-Quds, modern day Abla, near Zahlé 50km east of Beirut. There was a Byzantine and Christian Arab <b>garrison</b> guarding that fair, however {{the size of the}} <b>garrison</b> was miscalculated by the Muslim informants. The <b>garrison</b> quickly encircled the small Muslim force. Before it would have been completely destroyed, Abu Ubaidah, having received new intelligence, sent Khalid to rescue the Muslim army.

5|$|Soult {{could not}} besiege so strong a {{fortress}} as Badajoz with his reduced force and therefore changed his plans. Sending his light cavalry under Brig. Gen. André Briche to take Mérida and leaving four squadrons of dragoons at Albuera {{to watch the}} <b>garrison</b> at Badajoz, he marched with {{the remainder of his}} army to invest Olivenza. Wellington had previously advised Gen. Pedro Caro de La Romana, commander of the Spanish Army of Extremadura, either to destroy the fortification at Olivenza or to repair its defenses and fully <b>garrison</b> it; La Romana in turn had instructed Mendizabal to slight the fortress, but Mendizabal ignored this order and instead reinforced the <b>garrison</b> with four infantry battalions. Soult, arriving on 11 January, was therefore confronted with a strongly garrisoned—but untenable—fortress. The heavy French artillery finally began to arrive on 19 January, and by 22 January a poorly repaired breach in the fortress' walls had been reopened. The <b>garrison</b> surrendered on 23 January, with over 4,000 Spanish troops from the Army of Extremadura taken captive.|$|E
