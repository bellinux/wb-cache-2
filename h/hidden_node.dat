40|$|Abstract — Optimizing {{spectral}} reuse is a {{major issue}} in large-scale IEEE 802. 11 wireless networks. Power control is an effective means for doing so. Much previous work simply assumes that each transmitter should use the minimum transmit power needed to reach its receiver, and that this would maximize the network capacity by increasing spectral reuse. It turns out that this is not necessarily the case, primarily because of <b>hidden</b> <b>nodes.</b> In a network without power control, {{it is well known that}} <b>hidden</b> <b>nodes</b> give rise to unfair network bandwidth distributions and large bandwidth oscillations. Avoiding <b>hidden</b> <b>nodes</b> (by extending the carrier-sensing range), however, may cause the network to have lower overall network capacity. This paper shows that in a network with power control, reducing the instances of <b>hidden</b> <b>nodes</b> can not only prevent unfair bandwidth distributions, but also achieve higher overall network capacity compared with the minimum-transmit-power approach. We propose and investigate two distributed adaptive power control algorithms that minimize mutual interferences among links while avoiding <b>hidden</b> <b>nodes.</b> In general, our power control algorithms can boost the capacity of ordinary non-power-controlled 802. 11 networks by more than two times while eliminating <b>hidden</b> <b>nodes...</b>|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the relevant and the most influential variables of the forecasting process, a factorial design is employed in this research. The factors include the 27 features given in the Table  1, each with two levels (0 and 1). Level 1 of a factor indicates that the corresponding factor is used as a feature, and level 0 represents the nonexistence of the factor. In addition to the 27 features, the number of <b>hidden</b> <b>nodes</b> is also considered as a potential factor in designing the experiments. Note that experiments with fewer input factors need fewer <b>hidden</b> <b>nodes</b> and vice versa. In other words, the number of <b>hidden</b> <b>nodes</b> of the proposed ANN for experiments on a large number of features should be high enough to have the ability of capturing the patterns. Therefore, the number of <b>hidden</b> <b>nodes</b> is not constant in all experiments and is considered a factor in the experiments. Considering the number of other features, four levels of the number of <b>hidden</b> <b>nodes</b> including 5, 15, 30, and 60 are considered in this research. As a result, the total number of combinations is 229 (four for the number of <b>hidden</b> <b>nodes</b> and 227 for the other features). We also note that only one replicate of this design needs 229 experiments, which is impractical. To make the total number of experiments practical, two approaches are used.|$|R
40|$|Throughput {{improvement}} of the Wireless LANs {{has been a constant}} area of research. Most of the work in this area, focuses on designing throughput optimal schemes for fully connected networks (no <b>hidden</b> <b>nodes).</b> But, we demonstrate that the proposed schemes, though perform optimally in fully connected network, achieve significantly lesser throughput even than that of standard IEEE 802. 11 in a network with <b>hidden</b> <b>nodes.</b> This motivates the need for designing schemes that provide near optimal performance even when <b>hidden</b> <b>nodes</b> are present. The primary reason for the failure of existing protocols in the presence of <b>hidden</b> <b>nodes</b> is that these protocols are based on the model developed by Bianchi. However this model does not hold when <b>hidden</b> <b>nodes</b> exist. Moreover, analyzing networks with <b>hidden</b> <b>nodes</b> is still an open problem. Thus, designing throughput optimal schemes in networks with <b>hidden</b> <b>nodes</b> is particularly challenging. The novelty of our approach {{is that it is not}} based on any underlying mathematical model, rather it directly tunes the control variables so as to maximize the throughput. We demonstrate that this model independent approach achieves maximum throughput in networks with hidden terminals as well. Apart from this major contribution, we present stochastic approximation based algorithms for achieving weighted fairness in a connected networks. We also present a throughput optimal exponential backoff based random access algorithm. We demonstrate that the exponential backoff based scheme may outperform an optimal p-persistent scheme in networks with hidden terminals. This demonstrates the merit of exponential backoff based random access schemes which was deemed unnecessary by results shown by Bianchi. Comment: 16 pages, 13 figure...|$|R
