40|$|Learned {{associations}} between effects of abused <b>drugs</b> <b>and</b> the <b>drug</b> administration environment {{are important in}} <b>drug</b> addiction. Histochemical <b>and</b> electrophysiological studies suggest that these associations are encoded in sparsely distributed nucleus accumbens neurons that are selectively activated by <b>drugs</b> <b>and</b> drug-associated cues. Although correlations have been observed between nucleus accumbens neuronal activity <b>and</b> responsivity to <b>drugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> cues, no technique exists for selectively manipulating these activated neurons and establishing their causal role in behavioral effects of <b>drugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> cues. Here we describe a new approach, which we term the 'Daun 02 inactivation method', that selectively inactivates a minority of neurons previously activated by cocaine in an environment repeatedly paired with cocaine to demonstrate a causal role for these activated neurons in context-specific cocaine-induced psychomotor sensitization in rats. This method provides a new tool for studying the causal roles of selectively activated neurons in behavioral effects of <b>drugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>drug</b> cues <b>and</b> in other learned behavior...|$|R

5|$|Tertiary sexual {{dysfunction}} results from {{psychological and social}} factors. Reduced libido, desire, or experience of arousal {{could be due to}} psychological or situational factors such as depression, anxiety, and changes in relationships. Both sexes experience reduced sexual desire after SCI, and almost half of men and almost three quarters of women have trouble becoming psychologically aroused. Depression is {{the most common cause of}} problems with arousal in people with SCI. People frequently experience grief and despair initially after the injury. Anxiety and <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol abuse may increase after discharge from a hospital as new challenges occur, which can exacerbate sexual difficulties. <b>Drug</b> <b>and</b> alcohol abuse increase unhealthy behaviors, straining relationships and social functioning.|$|E

However, existing data suggest that patients taking bedaquiline in addition to standard TB therapy are five times more likely to die than those without the new drug, which has resulted in medical journal articles raising health policy questions about why the FDA approved the <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> whether financial ties to the company making bedaquiline influenced physicians' support for its use.|$|E
