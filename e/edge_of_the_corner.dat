50|$|Also {{known as}} an {{inverted}} frankensteiner, this is a hurricanrana executed on an opponent sitting on the top turnbuckle. However, unlike a standard frankensteiner, the opponent is facing away from the ring on the top turnbuckle thus the opponent backflips over and lands {{on his or her}} chest rather than his or her back. This move can also be performed to the outside of the ring if the opponent is facing the inside of the ring or sitting on one <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> turnbuckle facing the audience with both legs {{on the outside of the}} ring on the same side. There is also a standing variation of this move in which the wrestler jumps onto the opponent's shoulders from behind and then flips backwards driving the opponent's head and/or chest onto the mat.|$|E
40|$|Trigate Field Effect Transistor (FET) {{is one of}} the {{promising}} devices to overcome MOSFET scaling. However, major problems arised due to <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> which introduced a high leakage current as well as reliability issues. In this work, we have introduced a method to reduce these issues by incorporating a semi-cylindrical channel through simulation. Based on simulated results, it was found that this method can minimize the leakage current. In addition, this structure makes the device less sensitive to temperature effect and more robust. Besides, radius variation can be used to reduce leakage current even smaller. It was found that the maximum drive current of this device is higher compared to reported silicon nanowire trigate MOSFET...|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} the facets of the remaining surfaces, the six smooth prismatic side planes of the rods are identified according to K. S. Chen et al. [23]. They used H implantation and subsequent high temperature annealing on ZnO surface to determine the relative surface formation energies and to construct a Wulff plot. Their {{results indicate that the}} six smooth prismatic side planes are (1010), (0110), (1010), (0110), (1100), and (1100), consistent with the reports from B. Liu et al. [19] and W. Zheng et al. [24]. The six smooth prismatic side planes intersect at six < 1210 > directions. Since the etching started from the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> of top-end hexagonal surface, the remaining surfaces would be those stable facets for the microrod with zone axis along six < 1210 >. Thus, in Fig.  3 g, g', the 12 tilt surfaces can be divided into six groups belonging to six < 1210 > directions. Again K. S. Chen et al. [23] have reported the surface formation energy of ZnO nanowire with zone axis along [1210]. Their data show that the most stable facets are (1014) and (1014). Therefore, 12 tilt surfaces are the (1014) and (1014) facets of each [1210] directions as zone axis.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> {{feasibility}} <b>of</b> using a 45 deg-honeycomb {{for improving}} the flow quality in wind tunnels was investigated. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experiments indicate that the turbulence levels in a wind tunnel using the 45 deg-honeycomb would be comparable to those obtainable using a conventional honeycomb, i. e., a honeycomb which is positioned normal to the mean flow in the settling chamber.

We study pairwise interactions of elliptical quasi-geostrophic vortices as <b>the</b> limiting case <b>of</b> vanishingly thin uniform potential vorticity ellipsoids. In this limit, <b>the</b> product <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vertical extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ellipsoid and the potential vorticity within it is held fixed to a finite non-zero constant. Such elliptical 'lenses' inherit the property that, in isolation, they steadily rotate without changing shape. Here, we use this property to extend both standard moment models and Hamiltonian ellipsoidal models to approximate <b>the</b> dynamical interaction <b>of</b> such elliptical lenses. By neglecting non-elliptical deformations, the simplified models reduce the dynamics to just four degrees of freedom per vortex. For simplicity, we focus on pairwise interactions between identical elliptical vortices initially separated in both the horizontal and vertical directions. <b>The</b> dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> simplified models are compared with the full quasi-geostrophic (QG) dynamics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system, and show good agreement as expected for sufficiently distant lenses. The results reveal <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> families of steadily rotating equilibria in the initial horizontal and vertical separation parameter space. For sufficiently large vertical separations, equilibria with varying shape exist for all horizontal separations. Below a critical vertical separation (stretched by <b>the</b> constant ratio <b>of</b> buoyancy to Coriolis frequencies N/f), comparable to <b>the</b> mean radius <b>of</b> either vortex, a gap opens in horizontal separation where no equilibria are possible.
