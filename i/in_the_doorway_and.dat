John's sitting area is {{revealed}} to be a lift, which they use to leave the factory. The tech team tracks the video's source and Rigg leads his team to a house, where they find VCRs playing previously recorded images. As Kerry realizes the game took place before they found John, the timer expires and a large safe opens, revealing Daniel bound and breathing into an oxygen mask. Eric enters the house alone and eventually locates the bathroom, where he is attacked by a pig-masked figure. He awakens shackled at the ankle to a pipe; a tape recorder left by Amanda reveals that she is John's accomplice and intends to continue his work after he dies.

500|$|But {{there are}} other {{explanations}} for the missing rations. The inexperienced New Guinea Force staff assumed that the supplies they despatched would arrive, but this {{was far from the}} case with air dropping, the techniques for which had yet to be properly developed. Kienzle picked what he thought were good drop zones, but the air crews sometimes found them restricted or dangerous. The aircraft had to fly low over the drop zone, at about , and slow, at about [...] They had to take the wind into account, as it might cause parachuted packages to miss the drop zone. The load would be placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway,</b> <b>and</b> three or four men would push it out when the pilot gave the signal. The pilot would fly level or with the nose slightly down, so that cargo would not hit the tail of the aircraft. The pilot would retract the landing gear if it was down, and climb to gain altitude. Multiple passes over the drop zone might be required. Heavy loads were not practical for air dropping missions, since the aircraft had to arrive low and slow over the drop zone, but higher speed was required for greater weight. Nor could an overloaded aircraft climb or dive quickly. The 21st and 22nd Troop Carrier Squadrons were still based in Queensland and not at Port Moresby, so the aircrew were there on short rotations. Their learning process was therefore fitful and slow. Men from various Army and RAAF units assisted the aircrew in the task of pushing stores out of the aircraft.|$|E

2500|$|In this deposition, Peak {{told the}} County Attorney {{that he wanted}} to [...] "get out of this whole thing." [...] He cannot {{remember}} details of his story, such as the name of a woman who drove him from NCCF headquarters to David Rice's house to pick up the suitcase bomb. The County Attorney provided him Norma Aufrecht's name. Peak repeatedly said that Edward Poindexter got a box of dynamite and a suitcase out of David Rice's basement. At the trial, he would change his testimony to implicate another NCCF member, when his new testimony was that Raleigh House drove Duane with a suitcase full of dynamite to David Rice's house, Edward Poindexter took three sticks to make the bomb and put the remaining sticks in a box, which he took into the basement. Peak also claimed that he put the suitcase {{in the middle of the}} room standing up, and that someone else must have laid it down <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> <b>and</b> armed it to explode. He refused to say that he attached the bomb to the floor, which annoyed Art O'Leary who told him on page 25, [...] "As a practical matter, it doesn't make any difference what the truth is concerning you at all." [...] At other points in the deposition, Peak said that police officers told him Panthers were coming from out of town to eliminate him. He specifically said that Foxall told him he was the last person seen carrying a suitcase at 28th and Ohio that night.|$|E
2500|$|In the evening, {{at around}} 6 or 7pm, Dan and Joe kidnapped and handcuffed Anton Weekes, a German-Australian market {{gardener}} who lived nearby, reassuring {{him that he}} would not be hurt if he obeyed. They pushed him to the Sherritts' back door and Joe asked Weekes to knock, which he did. Sherritts' young wife asked: [...] "Who is there?", repeated by Sherritt. Prompted by Joe, Weekes replied: [...] "It is me, I have lost my way", to which Sherritt's wife opened the door. Aaron stood framed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> <b>and</b> joked with his German neighbor. [...] "You must be drunk, Anton. You know that it's over that way", he laughed. As Sherritt raised his arm to point the way for Weekes, he almost immediately afterwards made a movement backwards and said, [...] "Who's that?". Two shots were then fired into the house and Sherritt staggered back, having been hit in the left side of the neck, severing his jugular. One of the shots narrowly missed Sherritt's wife. Byrne followed him in and fired again, hitting him in the chest, and Sherritt collapsed. Sherritt died within a few minutes without another saying a word. His mother-in-law, Ellen Barry, testified to the commission that at this point she knelt down by her son-in-law's head, and Byrne called her by her name (they were well acquainted, Ellen Barry had been a particular friend of Byrne's mother) and threatened to shoot her and her daughter if they did not reveal who was in the bedroom. She asked to go outside and when she did, Byrne took off Weekes' handcuffs, telling her [...] "I am satisfied now, I wanted that fellow." [...] Ellen Barry said that she responded [...] "Well, Joe, I never heard Aaron say anything against you." [...] And he replied [...] "He would do me harm if he could; he did his best." ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractTemple of Augustus and Rome, also {{referred}} as Monumentum Ancyranum (Ankara Temple), is located near Haci Bayram Mosque <b>in</b> Ulus, Ankara. <b>The</b> temple {{which was built}} on behalf of Phrygian God ‚ÄòMen‚Äô in 2 nd century BC has been destroyed.

The positions of <b>the</b> 4 columns <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorways</b> <b>and</b> 2 columns <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rear sides are recognizable. Currently, only the sidewalls and ornamented door part are remaining. The original testament of Augustus in Temple of Rome, which is written in Latin and Greek and is telling the achievements of Augustus, is imitated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mosque that is neighboring the wall of Monumentum Ancyranum.

25|$|During the Manueline era {{many of the}} {{national}} forals were re-issued, especially after the 11th and 15th century. Between 1513 and 1516, King Manuel I issued a new foral to Mafra, Ericeira and Cheleiros, and in 1519, conceded a foral to Enxara dos Cavaleiros, while confirming a foral to Gradil (then originally donated by Afonso IV of Portugal <b>in</b> 1327). During <b>the</b> Manueline reforms, the municipalities that received these forals constructed pillories or required to refurbished their administrative markers. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> census of 18 September 1527, there was an estimated 191 residents, of which only four couples lived within the village.

The tower has a square-headed south doorway, a small west window, a clock face on the south side, and two-light louvred bell openings. At {{the top of the}} tower is an embattled parapet. To the west of the north aisle is a lean-to structure containing a round-headed west <b>doorway.</b> <b>The</b> south porch is gabled with a round-headed doorway, leading to a pointed-arched <b>doorway</b> into <b>the</b> church. Along the sides of the clerestory on each side are four two-light windows <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nave, and two three-light windows <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chancel.
