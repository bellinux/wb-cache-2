40|$|Cloud Forensics is an {{emerging}} {{topic in the}} Digital Forensics context. It concerns with the management of digital crimes in the Cloud Computing environment. The specific characteristics of Cloud Computing determine new challenges for practitioners and researchers dealing with Cloud crimes. In this paper, we discuss the impact of Cloud Computing into the Digital Forensics field and {{the relation between the}} specific Cloud Computing features with the challenges they provide from the forensics point of view taking into account technical, organizational, and legal dimensions. An approach for conducting proactive investigations {{and at the same time}} improving Cloud security is based on the development of a Cloud Forensic Readiness System, meant to collect and store data coming from the Cloud infrastructure to be then <b>exploited</b> <b>for</b> <b>conducting</b> digital crimes investigations more effectively. A reference architecture for such a system is described...|$|E

40|$|The cold, dry {{and stable}} air above the summits of the Antarctic plateau {{provides}} the best ground-based observing conditions from optical to sub-mm wavelengths to {{be found on the}} Earth. PILOT is a proposed 2 m telescope, to be built at Dome C in Antarctica, able to <b>exploit</b> these conditions <b>for</b> <b>conducting</b> astronomy at optical and infrared wavelengths. While PILOT is intended as a pathfinder towards the construction of future grand-design facilities, it will also be able to undertake a range of fundamental science investigations in its own right. This paper provides the performance specifications for PILOT, including its instrumentation. It then describes the kinds of science projects that it could best conduct. These range from planetary science to the search for other solar systems, from star formation within the Galaxy to the star formation history of the Universe, and from gravitational lensing caused by exo-planets to that produced by the cosmic web of dark matter. PILOT would be particularly powerful for wide-field imaging at infrared wavelengths, achieving near-diffraction limited performance with simple tip-tilt wavefront correction. PILOT would also be capable of near-diffraction limited performance in the optical wavebands, as well be able to open new wavebands for regular ground based observation; in the mid-IR from 17 to 40 micron and in the sub-mm at 200 micron...|$|R
