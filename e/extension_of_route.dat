5|$|In 1953, the {{legislature}} added an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 15 from US 101 at Willits (north of Ukiah) west to SR 1 near Fort Bragg. This was constructed (over an existing county road) and {{became part of}} Sign Route 20 prior to 1964, when the Route 20 designation was legislatively adopted. Subsequent improvements include {{the construction of the}} Golden Center Freeway, connecting Grass Valley with Nevada City, in the late 1960s, and a new alignment of SR 20 west from Grass Valley, bypassing Rough and Ready, in the mid-1980s.|$|E
5|$|King's Highway 148, {{commonly}} referred to as Highway 148, is a provincially maintained highway in Ontario, Canada. The highway acts as an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 148 in Quebec, once connecting it with Highway 17, the Trans-Canada Highway, near Pembroke. It was shortened to its present terminus in 1997, and now connects downtown Pembroke to the provincial border. Highway148 follows a route that was once part of Highway17 and Highway62 until the Pembroke Bypass opened in 1982.|$|E
5|$|The {{intersection}} of Route 14 with Via Princessa in Santa Clarita {{is an unusual}} design, with long flyover ramps for the connections. This {{is the result of}} a freeway revolt by the residents of Santa Clarita, that canceled plans for a freeway <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 126. While the Via Princessa alignment of Route 126 was canceled, a different alignment is being constructed with proposed connections to Route 14.|$|E

50|$|Route 138 is a north - south {{state highway}} in Massachusetts. From {{the state line}} in Tiverton, Rhode Island to Milton, Route 138 runs as an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> Rhode Island <b>Route</b> 138, which is itself an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> Connecticut <b>Route</b> 138.|$|R
5|$|In 1981, {{ten years}} after the eastern <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 37 was canceled, RIDOT began {{planning}} studies for a western extension of the freeway. The expressway was included in a proposal to extend I-84 eastward from Hartford, Connecticut to Providence; more northern alignments for the freeway had been rejected due to concerns of potential damage to the Scituate Reservoir. The southern routing of I-84, which would have utilized Route 37 and terminated in Warwick, largely bypassed the reservoir's watershed. In 1982, however, I-84 was officially canceled by RIDOT after studies indicated that the southern alignment was not a feasible alternative.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, RIDOT {{reviewed}} {{plans for}} an eastern <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 37. The department conducted planning studies on two proposed freeway alignments that would extend Route 37 into Downtown Warwick. The first proposal continued the freeway southeast from US 1 to Airport Road for , while the second proposal extended the freeway east for , intersecting Route 117 and Route 117A {{in the village of}} Hoxsie before terminating at Route 117 (West Shore Road). The first option was ultimately dropped by RIDOT after studies indicated the routing would interfere with aviation traffic at T. F. Green Airport. The freeway extension to Route 117, however, remains on RIDOT's long-term plans.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{improving}} road {{access to the}} Fort Dix Military Reservation {{at the onset of}} World War II, a Works Progress Administration project improved the paved road connecting the fort to Bordentown. In 1941, this road was legislated as Route S39, a state highway spur of Route 39 (now US206) that was to run from the fort to Mansfield Square. Construction on the access road was completed in 1943 at a cost of over $2 million. Route S39 became Route 68 in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering. The same year, an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 68 was legislated to run south from Fort Dix to the intersection with Route 70 and Route 72 at the Four Mile Circle. In 1961, a freeway was proposed along the Route 68 corridor, running from a planned Route 38 freeway near Fort Dix south to Route 70 and Route 72; however, this was never built.|$|E

5|$|In 1927, Route 3 was legislated {{along the}} Paterson Plank Road portion of present-day Route 120. It was {{eventually}} designated {{along the entire}} portion of current Route 120. In 1953, Route 3 was moved to its current freeway alignment, replacing Route S3, and a portion of Route 20 was designated to run from current Route 3 north to Paterson Plank Road while Paterson Plank Road {{was removed from the}} state highway system. The portion of Paterson Plank Road that lost its state highway status in 1953 gained it back in 1972, when it became an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 20 {{as a result of the}} construction of the Meadowlands Sports Complex. As this route was not connected to the mainline of Route 20, it was designated Route 120 by the 1990s. As a result of the construction of American Dream Meadowlands, the interchange between Route 3 and Route 120 was improved. An overpass between eastbound Route 3 and northbound Route 120 was completed in 2009 and a flyover from southbound Route 120 to eastbound Route 3 was completed in 2010.|$|E
5|$|In the 1927 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, a spur of Route 41 called Route S41 was legislated {{to run from}} the Tacony-Palmyra Bridge south to Berlin along what is today Route 73. A {{southern}} <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> S41 called Route S41A was proposed to run from Berlin south to Route 42 (now U.S. Route 322) in Folsom in 1938. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route S41 and Route S41A were renumbered to Route 73 in order to match Pennsylvania Route 73. With {{the establishment of the}} 500-series county routes in 1952, the current alignment of Route 73 between Berlin and Blue Anchor became a part of County Route 561 while it became County Route 561 Spur between Blue Anchor and Folsom. By 1969, Route 73 was designated south of Berlin along County Route 561 and County Route 561 Spur to the Atlantic City Expressway. By the 2000s, Route 73 was extended south along with County Route 561 Spur from the Atlantic City Expressway to U.S. Route 322.|$|E
5|$|Lassen and Modoc Counties {{organized}} Joint Highway District No. 14 on December 21, 1929 {{to construct}} and maintain a road from Susanville via Adin to Oregon. However, since the state took over the part north of Adin, the district's scope was narrowed to Susanville-Adin. It finally completed work in 1956, and held a ceremony on August 26, in which it placed a monument at a point near Eagle Lake. The legislature added {{the road to the}} state highway system as Route 216 in 1959. The portion south of Horse Lake Road became an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 20 instead; this route from Susanville to Ravendale (later Termo) was never constructed by the state, and was deleted from SR 36 in 1998. Also in 1959, a spur of Route 210 west to Dorris was added; this became SR 161 in 1964.|$|E

50|$|State Route 32 had {{run from}} Boykins west to Emporia, north to Purdy, and east through Jarratt. A short piece from Boykins to Branchville became an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> State <b>Route</b> 195, which had ended at Branchville. SR 32 from Branchville to Purdy became a new State Route 88, and the piece east from Purdy became an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> State <b>Route</b> 137. This {{had the effect}} of freeing up the State Route 32 {{designation}} for a renumbering <b>of</b> State <b>Route</b> 10 south <b>of</b> Suffolk to match North Carolina Highway 32.|$|R
5|$|Plans for a limited-access highway {{along the}} U.S. Route 202 {{corridor}} {{date back to}} 1932 when a parkway was planned to continue into Pennsylvania along U.S. Route 202; this proposal never came to fruition. In the 1960s, a bypass around Ringoes opened for U.S. Route 202 and Route 69 (which became Route 31 in 1967) with the former alignment of U.S. Route 202 through town becoming Route 179. In 1966, a freeway was proposed along the U.S. Route 202 corridor between the Pennsylvania border and Interstate 287 in Bridgewater Township. The portion of this freeway between the Pennsylvania border and the Route 179 interchange in Ringoes was legislated in 1969 with the New Hope-Lambertville Toll Bridge opening in 1971. The freeway opened in October 1974, and the former alignment of U.S. Route 202 between Lambertville and Ringoes became an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 179. Meanwhile, {{the portion of the}} proposed U.S. Route 202 freeway between Lambertville and Bridgewater Township was cancelled due to opposition from residents along the route.|$|E
5|$|Since {{at least}} 1936, Route 17 (then Route 2) was planned for {{upgrading}} to a freeway, not only north of U.S. Route 46, but also {{south to the}} Newark area. The first plan for a freeway {{along the length of}} the route was halted due to World War II, and the second plan for a freeway in the 1960s was cancelled due to the disruption it was projected to cause to businesses and residents along its path. In 1972, there were plans to extend Route 17 past Route 3 to Interstate 280 in Harrison. The plans for this five-mile (eight kilometer), $50 million extension were cancelled due to the defeat of a transportation bond that would have funded the proposed freeway. The interchange at Route 3 was built to allow for this southern extension. Another <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 17 to the New Jersey Turnpike was brought up in 1987, but was ultimately scrapped.|$|E
5|$|The {{road was}} built as an {{approach}} to the Lincoln Tunnel, with the first section opening December 22, 1937, when the first (now the center) tube of the tunnel was completed. This section ran only from the tunnel portal south through the toll booths to a plaza with Park Avenue and Hudson County Boulevard East. Marginal Street, providing access from Hudson County Boulevard East west over Park Avenue to 32nd Street and the Bergen Turnpike, was also opened at that time. In 1939, the Port Authority opened {{the rest of the}} approach, up the helix and west to Route 3, and it was designated as an eastern <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 3. The final section of today's Route 495 opened on January 15, 1952, with the completion of the New Jersey Turnpike. The turnpike interchange (exit 16) only served Route 3 traffic to and from the south; exit 17 served Route 3 traffic to and from the north.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{began on}} July 1, 1928, with convict labor for the easier {{portions}} and contractors for the remainder, {{as well as}} bridges and tunnels, but was slowed by the Great Depression. On the most difficult portion, between Cresta and Rock Creek, three tunnels had to be built at Arch Rock, Grizzly Dome, and Elephant Butte; at the former two, surveyors had to hang out on rope over steep granite slopes, and rockslides repeatedly caused delays. The commission dedicated the road at a ceremony at Grizzly Dome, halfway between the ends, on August 14, 1937. Construction had cost $8.15 million for 78 miles (126km) of new road. The remainder of the old trail from Quincy to the junction with Route 29 (now U.S. 395) east of Beckwourth Pass {{was added to the}} state highway system in 1931 as an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 21, and was paved by 1936. A new Route 87 was created in 1933, stretching from Woodland via Marysville and Oroville to Route 3 (State Route 99) southeast of Chico, including the present SR 70 between Marysville and Oroville. Route 87 from Woodland to Oroville and Route 21 from Oroville to east of Beckwourth Pass became a new State Route 24 in 1934; State Route 24 was extended southwest from Woodland to Oakland by the end of 1937.|$|E
5|$|In the 1927 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, Route 17N {{received}} the Route 2 designation, and was defined {{to run from}} Route 7 in North Arlington to the New York border near Suffern, New York. By 1937, the whole old road north of Rutherford was bypassed by a new four-lane divided highway {{with the exception of}} the 1927 bridge over the Saddle River in Ridgewood, north of the Paramus Road interchange. This old alignment joins at Paramus Road and leaves just north of the bridge at Franklin Turnpike, which only has access to the southbound lanes through a RIRO intersection. A short-lived spur of Route 2, Route 2N, was defined in 1938 to run from Route 2 (Ridge Road) in Lyndhurst west along Kingsland Avenue and over the Passaic River on the Park Avenue Bridge into Nutley, where it would end at Union Avenue (west of Route 7). In 1930, New York had renumbered its state routes; the <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 2 north and west into New York had remained New York State Route 17. New Jersey had not assigned a Route 17 in the 1927 renumbering, and so in March 1942, Route 2 was numbered Route 17 to match and provide a single number for military caravans during World War II.|$|E
5|$|The short {{piece from}} SR 36 north to Peanut {{was added to}} the state highway system in 1907 as part of the Peanut Road, which became Route 35 in 1917. Route 35 was {{extended}} north from Peanut to Route 20 (SR 299) near Douglas City in 1933, and simultaneously a new Route 82 was created, running from Route 3 (I-5) in the Yreka area southwest to Etna and east to Montague. The gap between Douglas City and Etna was filled in 1959 with an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> 82 south to Route 20 near Weaverville; at the same time, the portion between Weaverville and Yreka {{was added to the}} California Freeway and Expressway System, which identifies the main routes of transportation in the state of California. The State Route 3 designation was applied to the Peanut-Montague roadway in the 1964 renumbering. The overlap with temporary I-5 (along the portion where SR 3 runs concurrently with Interstate 5 today) near Yreka was removed when the new I-5 bypass was built; the legislative definition was updated to reflect this in 1974, soon after the building of the bypass.|$|E
50|$|Tram {{service is}} {{provided}} by 391 carriages, of which 154 are modern low floor carriages and 237 are older carriages. Virtually all of the remaining network is {{within the confines of}} the former East Berlin, as all the routes in the former West Berlin were abandoned during the period of the city's partition. However, there have been some <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>routes</b> across the former border since reunification, most remarkably to the city’s new main railway station Berlin Hauptbahnhof (lines M5, M8 and M10).|$|R
50|$|U.S. Route 15 was {{relocated}} between Warrenton and Gilberts Corner. The old alignment {{became an}} <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> State <b>Route</b> 17 (to match Maryland Route 17), {{while the new}} alignment replaced a secondary <b>route</b> and part <b>of</b> State <b>Route</b> 234.|$|R

5|$|In 1927, a spur of Route 4, Route S4A, was {{proposed}} as a route running from Route 4 (now U.S. Route 9) in Tuckerton in Ocean County south to Little Beach. In 1929, this route was to continue south through Brigantine to Atlantic City, with the portion south of Little Beach {{to be built}} by Atlantic County. The state of New Jersey took over the proposed <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>Route</b> S4A from Little Beach to Atlantic City in 1938. However, the portion of this route between Brigantine and the Atlantic/Ocean County line was never built, and the portion of road that existed in Ocean County {{was removed from the}} state highway system by 1941. In 1945, another route called Route S56, a spur of Route 56 (now U.S. Route 30), {{was proposed}} to run north along Brigantine Boulevard (present-day Route 187 and Route 87) from Atlantic City to Brigantine. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 87 was designated as an unsigned route along the former alignment of Route S4A and the proposed Route S56 between U.S. Route 30 in Atlantic City and Brigantine. Following the 1953 renumbering, the southern portion of Route 87 in Atlantic City split into two alignments, with one following Huron Avenue and the other following Brigantine Boulevard. Eventually, the alignment of Route 87 along Brigantine Boulevard between U.S. Route 30 and Huron Avenue became Route 187. In 2001, the Atlantic City – Brigantine Connector was completed, linking Route 87, the casinos in the Marina District, and Brigantine with the Atlantic City Expressway.|$|E
