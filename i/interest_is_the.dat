5|$|Of {{greatest}} <b>interest</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> fourth {{composition of}} historical figures, {{a young man}} and a woman, which was painted on the lowest west wall of the narthex and includes inscriptions in Old Church Slavonic. The figures are painted facing the viewer. The man's red clothing is covered in pearls and double-headed eagles, and he wears an archaic-looking despot's crown on his head. In his right hand, the man holds a sceptre with a cross. He extends his hand to a woman, clad in a despotissa's attire and wearing a fitting crown.|$|E
5|$|Of {{particular}} <b>interest</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that}} the Schechter Letter account of Oleg's death (namely, that he fled to and raided FRS, tentatively identified with Persia, and was slain there) bears remarkable parallels to the account of Arab historians such as Ibn Miskawayh, who described a similar Rus' attack on the Muslim state of Arran in the year 944/5.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} architecture, the church {{features}} a round dome {{and a single}} apse. The naos or cella has {{the shape of a}} cross, in line with the popular Byzantine cross-in-square design. Of particular <b>interest</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> formerly two-storey narthex, which is notable for its unusual verticality and the towers {{on either side of the}} entrance. Judging by the models depicted in the donor's portraits inside the church, it is clear that the towers were originally further apart and the west facade with the narthex included much woodwork. The towers are topped off by sharp-pointed pyramidal elements, with additional sharp-pointed details in each of the pyramids' four corners. The towers and their design are entirely unusual and unprecedented in medieval Bulgarian church architecture. Art historian Nikola Mavrodinov believes these resemble Gothic architecture, though a more modern researcher, Bistra Nikolova, dismisses his assessment and considers these an influence from Hungary or Transylvania.|$|E

5|$|Scientists {{have long}} been {{concerned}} that pesticides, including possibly some fungicides, may have sublethal effects on bees, not killing them outright, but instead impairing their development and behavior. Of special <b>interest</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> class of insecticides called neonicotinoids, which contain the active ingredient imidacloprid, and other similar chemicals, such as clothianidin and thiamethoxam. Honey bees may be affected by such chemicals when they are used as a seed treatment because they are known {{to work their way}} through the plant up into the flowers and leave residues in the nectar. The containment of neonicotinoids to crops and fields designated for treatment is difficult, and many times inefficient. Run-off from treated fields and farm machinery that is not properly cleaned after field treatments can lead to exposure and uptake of pesticides by untreated plants. Therefore, honey bees are not only exposed to neonicotinoids by foraging on treated plants, but also by foraging on plants unintentionally exposed to these chemicals. The doses taken up by bees are not lethal, but possible chronic problems could be caused by long-term exposure. In a laboratory setting, both lethal and sub-lethal effects on foraging behavior, memory, and learning ability have been observed in honey bees exposed to neonicotinoids. However, these effects were not seen in field studies with field-realistic dosages. Most corn grown in the US is treated with neonicotinoids, and a 2012 study found high levels of clothianidin in pneumatic planter exhaust. In the study, the insecticide was present in the soil of unplanted fields near those planted with corn and on dandelions growing near those fields. Another 2012 study also found clothianidin and imidacloprid in the exhaust of pneumatic seeding equipment.|$|E

25|$|An {{absolute}} {{requirement for}} life is an energy source, {{but the notion}} of planetary habitability implies that many other geophysical, geochemical, and astrophysical criteria must be met before the surface of an astronomical body is able to support life.

Research and theory {{in this regard is}} a component of planetary science and the emerging discipline of astrobiology.|$|E
25|$|Jerzy Siemiginowski-Eleuter was a {{prominent}} painter, one of several who worked for John III. Krzysztof Lubieniecki and Teodor Lubieniecki of the Polish Brethren, painted in the West. Szymon Czechowicz represented religious painting in the 18th century. Of particular <b>interest</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Sarmatist portrait painting. Usually anonymous, it often faithfully conveys crucial individual characteristics of ordinary Polish nobles and magnates, even if constrained by its artistic convention. Coffin portraits are an important subcategory of this type.|$|E
25|$|Fleetwood's parish church, St Peter's, {{designed}} by Decimus Burton in 1841, {{stands at the}} corner of Lord Street and North Albert Street. It formerly had a spire, but this was demolished in 1904. St Mary's, the town's main Roman Catholic church, stands nearby. Built in 1867, it was {{designed by}} E. W. Pugin.

25|$|From 1907, he {{also began}} to be {{influenced}} by the French composer Claude Debussy, whose compositions Kodály had brought back from Paris. Bartók's large-scale orchestral works were still in the style of Johannes Brahms and Richard Strauss, but he wrote a number of small piano pieces which showed his growing interest in folk music. The first piece to show clear signs of this new <b>interest</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> String Quartet No. 1 in A minor (1908), which contains folk-like elements.|$|E
25|$|Room 7 {{places the}} visitor in the 19th century with Gioachino Rossini, {{whose name is}} forever tied to Bologna. Portraits, busts, and libretti from the first {{recitals}} of Isabella Colbran, a singer and Rossini's first wife, can be found here. Also of <b>interest</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> original score of The Barber of Seville and some rather curious personal effects, like a dressing gown and a wig. Finally, one can behold Rossini's grand piano, which was constructed in 1844 by Camille Pleyel.|$|E
25|$|The {{throne of}} Sultan Mahmud I is the {{centerpiece}} of the fourth room.
