5|$|Your Honor, {{years ago}} I {{recognized}} my kinship with all living beings, and <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> that I {{was not one}} bit better than the meanest on earth. I said then, and I say now, that {{while there is a}} lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.|$|E
25|$|Inevitably, <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> to {{read the}} scripts of a foreign country. Around that time I went to the British Embassy, which was then still known as the Legation, and imposed myself on the Secretary Mr. (William George) Aston in his room. I {{was at the time}} {{occasionally}} babysitting Mr. Aston’s children. He had considerable understanding of Japanese literature. However Mr. Aston had brought into the Legation with him the scripts of various foreign plays. He had brought the complete works of Shakespeare though I doubted even though they were there that I would read them. So Mr. Aston, knowing the scripts of the various plays gave me readings, after all it was just the summary that I simply wanted to hear and as a consequence, based on that, I didn’t really end up appreciating the technique of playwriting.|$|E

[...] I heard it was President's Day. [...] All those people seemed bowing to the great ruler. [...] <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> to kill that ruler.|$|E

5000|$|Arnaz's {{determination}} to change scheduling formats went back several years, {{as far back}} as 1954. [...] "When I first suggested it, CBS wouldn't listen. Last year (1956) again, they talked me into continuing with the weekly half-hour. But this time (1957) <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> mind." ...|$|R
500|$|In an {{interview}} with newspaper editor Arthur Brisbane, Tesla {{said that he did}} not believe in telepathy, stating, [...] "Suppose <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> to murder you," [...] he said, [...] "In a second you would know it. Now, isn't that wonderful? By what process does the mind get at all this?" [...] In the same interview, Tesla said that he believed that all fundamental laws could be reduced to one.|$|E
500|$|On 15 June 1910, Bogdan Žerajić {{attempted}} {{to kill the}} iron-fisted Governor of Bosnia and Herzegovina, General Marijan Varešanin. Žerajić was a 22-year-old Orthodox Serb from Nevesinje, Herzegovina, who {{was a student at}} the Faculty of Law at the University of Zagreb and made frequent trips to Belgrade. (General Verešanin went on to crush the last Bosnian peasant uprising {{in the second half of}} 1910.) The five bullets Žerajić fired at Varešanin and the fatal bullet he put in his own brain made Žerajić an inspiration to future assassins, including Princip and Princip's accomplice Čabrinović. Princip said that Žerajić [...] "was my first model. When I was seventeen I passed whole nights at his grave, reflecting on our wretched condition and thinking of him. It is there that <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> sooner or later to perpetrate an outrage." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{spite of}} the difficulties, Shankly felt {{immediately}} at home in his new club and he believed that he shared an immediate bond with the supporters, the Liverpool history site saying they [...] "were his kind of people". He quickly established working relationships with the coaching staff of Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Reuben Bennett who shared his views about loyalty {{to each other and}} to the club. Paisley's influence at Liverpool was [...] "crucial" [...] for, as Kelly puts it, Shankly was [...] "the great motivating force behind Liverpool, but it was Paisley who was the tactician". One aspect of the quartet's legacy to football was the conversion of an old storage room into what became known as the [...] "Boot Room", which was used for tactical discussion while cleaning and repairing boots. Although Shankly believed he had an excellent coaching staff, the playing staff were not so impressive – indeed, Shankly said of the latter: [...] "After only one match I knew that the team as a whole was not good enough. <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> that we needed strengthening through the middle, a goalkeeper and a centre half who between them could stop goals, and somebody up front to create goals and score them". To deal with what he saw as a below average playing squad, 24 players were placed on the transfer list and all [...] had left the club within one year.|$|E

5000|$|Strutt {{acknowledged}} {{the influence of}} Bill Monroe and John Duffey but confessed: [...] "I was never any good at stealing licks accurately, so <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> own; copying any instrument I liked be it trumpet, dobro, clarinet or trombone." [...] He used to run jam sessions in Leeds, which often featured 20 musicians on numerous different instruments.|$|R

500|$|While {{media reports}} {{initially}} suggested that Abhishek Bachchan was being considered {{to portray the}} role of Vijay Chauhan, director Karan Malhotra approached Hrithik Roshan for the role. Roshan, however was sceptical on taking up a role earlier played by Amitabh Bachchan and agreed to star in the film only after months of deliberation. He said, [...] "The script had so much passion that I felt very emotional and <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> to do it". [...] On casting Hrithik, Malhotra explained, [...] "Hrithik has the charm of a boy and the attitude of a man. Also, he has a certain vulnerability, which I was looking in my characterisation of Vijay Dinananth Chauhan." [...] While explaining the character of Vijay Chauhan, Malhotra added, [...] "Nobody can play Vijay the way Amitabh Bachchan did, and I would have wanted my Vijay to be subtle even if it wasn't Hrithik. I wanted the negative characters in my film to be bigger. This made Hrithik's victory seem bigger." [...] In preparation for the film, Roshan {{did not look up}} Bachchan's performance in the original for inspiration, as he considered his role to be completely different. Roshan, however, faced several difficulties while filming. He suffered from a severe back injury, which caused him considerable pain, throughout the shooting schedule. In an interview with Filmfare he quoted, [...] "Agneepath is the hardest I’ve ever worked in my life. I didn’t know what the film had in store for me. I’ve never been so tired in my life. I have exhausted my body completely." ...|$|E
500|$|Linda Eastman was a music fan {{who once}} commented, [...] "all my teen years were spent with an {{ear to the}} radio." [...] At times, she played hookey to see artists such as Fabian, Bobby Darin and Chuck Berry. She became a popular {{photographer}} with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, [...] "It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked." [...] The pair first properly met in 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers, [...] "The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to... Pushiness worked for me that night!" [...] Linda said this about their meeting: [...] "I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else ... and I saw Paul {{at the other side}} of the room. He looked so beautiful that <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> I would have to pick him up." [...] The pair married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, [...] "We had a lot of fun together... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment." [...] He added, [...] "We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married, and it was nearly called off... miraculous that we made it. But we did." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dungan {{announced}} his retirement from baseball in January 1906 at age 39. Dungan later recalled: [...] "I was fed up on baseball although I had {{one of my best}} years in 1905. <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> I didn't want to follow the game indefinitely, limping {{from one place to another}} as my ability declined. And I had no managerial aspirations. So I just up and quit." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{crash was}} a {{significant}} turning point, as he explained to Billboard in 2006: [...] "...when I had that wreck <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind,</b> it put the fear of God in me. [...] No more smoking, no more drinking. [...] I didn't have to have no help, <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> to quit. [...] I don't crave it." [...] After the accident, Jones went on to release The Gospel Collection in 2003, which Billy Sherrill came out of retirement to produce. [...] He appeared at a televised Johnny Cash Memorial Concert in Jonesboro, Arkansas in 2003, singing [...] "Big River" [...] with Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson. [...] In 2008, Jones received the Kennedy Center Honor along with Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey of The Who, Barbra Streisand, Morgan Freeman and Twyla Tharp. [...] President George W. Bush disclosed that he had many of Jones' songs on his iPod. [...] Jones also served as judge in 2008 for the 8th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers. [...] and Rolling Stone named him number 43 in their 100 Greatest Singers of All Time issue. [...] An album titled Hits I Missed And One I Didn't, in which he covered hits he had passed on {{as well as a}} remake of his own [...] "He Stopped Loving Her Today", would be released as his final studio album. In 2012, Jones received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement award.|$|E
2500|$|Newsted {{has stated}} {{that he has never}} regretted leaving the band. In a 2009 interview, he said [...] "I tell you very honestly, one billion percent, I have never regretted leaving Metallica. It was the right thing for everyone. It {{was the right thing to}} do for the camp. That's it. I've never told anyone that I wanted to go back or {{anything}} like that—not once. <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind.</b> It was not an easy thing to do, but it was something I had to do. I thought about it very much before I pulled the trigger and because of that, I have never looked back. The past is where it's supposed to be." [...] It was mentioned in the film Some Kind of Monster that there was a rumor that Newsted would possibly rejoin the band, but it was proven false.|$|E
2500|$|Crosby {{had lived}} for decades in such areas of Manhattan as Hell's Kitchen, the Bowery, and the Tenderloin. She {{was aware of the}} great needs of {{immigrants}} and the urban poor, and was passionate to help those around her through urban rescue missions and other compassionate ministry organizations. [...] "From the time I received my first check for my poems, <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> to open my hand wide to those who needed assistance". Throughout her life, she was described as having [...] "a horror of wealth", never set prices for her speaking engagements, often refused honoraria, and [...] "what little she did accept she gave away almost as soon as she got it". She and her husband also organized concerts, with half the proceeds given to aid the poor. Throughout New York City, Crosby's sympathies for the poor were well-known, but consisted primarily of indirect involvement by giving contributions from the sale of her poems, and by writing and sending poems for special occasions for these missions to the dispossessed, as well as sporadic visits to those missions.|$|E

2500|$|Hirono's {{father was}} a {{compulsive}} gambler and alcoholic who would pawn his wife's possessions for gambling money. Treated [...] "like a slave," [...] by her in-laws, Hirono said, in 1951 Laura left her abusive marriage. The deciding moment for her had come after Akira, who had returned to Hawaii after the war, had sent some money for a school uniform for Laura's youngest son Wayne, but her husband had taken it to buy an overcoat. As Laura later recounted, [...] "My brother sent {{money to buy a}} school uniform for my son. My husband took the money, went to town and never came back home. It was getting closer to the start of school, so I went to look for him. I found out he had ordered an overcoat for himself with the money. He didn't need an overcoat in the spring. That's when <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>up</b> <b>my</b> <b>mind</b> to leave." [...] After telling her in-laws she would be taking her elder son and Hirono to school in her hometown, Laura left the house, never to return. Selling her clothes for the rail fare, she returned to her parents' house. Laura said, [...] "My husband never came around once; my parents were supportive and took all of us in. My mother gave us money. I guess it all boils down to love." ...|$|E
