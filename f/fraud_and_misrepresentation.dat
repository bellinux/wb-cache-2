500|$|By {{the turn}} of the 19th–20th centuries the boom in {{speculative}} shares had abated; some of Bottomley's fellow promoters, such as Whitaker Wright, were facing charges of <b>fraud</b> <b>and</b> <b>misrepresentation.</b> Bottomley ceased his operations, and resumed his earlier role of newspaper proprietor. In 1902 he bought a failing London evening paper, The Sun, to which he contributed a regular column, [...] "The World, the Flesh and the Devil". Another feature was Bottomley's employment of celebrity guest editors for special edition; among these were the comedian Dan Leno, the cricketer Kumar Shri Ranjitsinhji and the labour leader Ben Tillett. The paper was not a financial success, and Bottomley sold it in 1904. He had not given up altogether on speculative money-making schemes, and in 1905 he began an association with the financier Ernest Hooley. Among their joint enterprises was the promotion of the defunct, dry Basingstoke Canal as a major inland waterway, the [...] "London and South-Western Canal".

More exactly, it is an untruthful statement that is made (a) knowingly, and either (b) without belief in its truth or (c) reckless {{as to whether or}} not it is true. At times, recklessness, silence, or omission can also be enough to make a misrepresentation fraudulent or deceitful, for example where the person showed either utter indifference or a lack of care whether or not the statement was true, or deliberately stays silent when a previous statement is no longer the case. This can also include not bothering to check whether or not the statement is true. <b>Fraud</b> <b>and</b> deceit differ from negligence, because they are based on dishonesty while negligence means something closer to 'unreasonable carelessness' or 'lack of expected professional skill'.|$|R
