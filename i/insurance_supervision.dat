40|$|Abstract: The prompt {{corrective}} action provisions in FDICIA 1991 provide the supervisors with an unambiguous goal: “to resolve {{the problems of}} insured depository institutions at the least possible long-term cost to the deposit insurance fund. ” Yet performance of the regulators in achieving this goal has been lacking in that substantial losses continue to be imposed on the insurance funds when banks fail.

40|$|Researchers {{have pointed}} out that {{conflicts}} between the objectives of different bank regulators necessitate careful design of the institutional allocation of regulatory authority. In doing this, however, they often assume that regulators have incentives to share their private information regarding regulated banks.

We further show that this result has important implications for the institutional allocation of lending of last resort, deposit <b>insurance,</b> and bank <b>supervision.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The European Commission has {{put forward}} a new {{proposal}} for a directive on insurance mediation which should provide for significant changes in practices of selling insurance products and guarantee enhanced level of consumer protection. This proposal accompanies other regulatory initiatives in the insurance sector, all of them pursuing three main objectives: firstly, a strengthened <b>insurance</b> <b>supervision</b> with convergent supervisory standards at EU level; secondly, a better risk management of insurance companies; and thirdly a greater protection of policyholders. All these initiatives contribute to the EU programme on consumer protection and herald {{a new approach to}} EU insurance regulation and supervision. However, while the new supervisory rules are a direct response to the financial crisis and shortcomings of crossborder cooperation between national supervisors, the plans for the revision of insurance mediation rules were conceived much earlier due to scandals with mis-selling of insurance products in the United States and some EU Member States. This article will focus entirely on the Commission’s initiative in the consumer mediation area and the aspects of <b>insurance</b> <b>supervision</b> and risk management will be dealt with in separate articles...|$|E

40|$|Insurers face {{a number}} of {{significant}} areas of risk in the operation of an insurance business. As well as pure insurance risk, there are credit risk, investment (or market) risk, liquidity risk and operational risks to consider. Financial weakness or failure of an insurer can have significant impacts on large numbers of policyholders of all descriptions. In order to properly protect policyholder interest, it is therefore clear that the financial strength of the insurance industry should be subject to appropriate prudential regulation. Until the enactment of the <b>Insurance</b> (Prudential <b>Supervision)</b> Act 2010 (the Act) in September, there had been no previous comprehensive prudential regulatory regime covering the activities of insurers carrying on insurance business in New Zealand. 1 Now the industry is subject to a world-class regulatory model administered by the Reserve Bank. This article explores the reasons behind the introduction of the new legislation, its objectives and the Reserve Bank’s intended approach in achieving these. ...|$|R
40|$|Integrated {{agencies}} supervising banks, nonbank financial institutions, {{and securities}} markets have been gaining popularity around the globe. Using a unique data set {{on compliance with}} international standards in 84 countries, we find that greater supervisory integration is associated with higher quality of <b>insurance</b> and securities <b>supervision</b> and greater consistency of supervision across sectors. Within the different forms of integration, we find some support for the "twin peaks" model that integrates supervision across sectors but separates business conduct and prudential supervision. We also find that whether supervision is located inside or outside the central bank has no significant relation to supervisory quality. ...|$|R
40|$|In the 1990 s, large {{insurance}} companies failed {{in virtually every}} major market, prompting a fierce and ongoing debate about how to better protect policyholders. Drawing lessons from the failures of four {{insurance companies}}, When Insurers Go Bust dramatically advances this debate by arguing that the current approach to insurance regulation should be replaced with mechanisms that replicate the governance of non-financial firms. Rather than immediately addressing the minutiae of supervision, Guillaume Plantin and Jean-Charles Rochet first identify a fundamental economic rationale for supervising the solvency of insurance companies: policyholders are the "bankers" of insurance companies. But because policyholders are too dispersed to effectively monitor insurers, it might be efficient to delegate monitoring to an institution [...] a prudential authority. Applying recent developments in corporate finance theory and the economic theory of organizations, the authors describe in practical terms how such authorities could be created and given the incentives to behave exactly like bankers behave toward borrowers, as "tough" claimholders. <b>insurance,</b> regulation, <b>supervision,</b> solvency, claimholders, finance theory, theory of organizations, authorities, incentives...|$|R
