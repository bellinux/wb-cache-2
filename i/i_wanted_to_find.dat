500|$|The idea of {{parallel}} lives has been explored before in {{films such as}} Run Lola Run (1998) and Sliding Doors (1998) which influenced Van Dormael's writing. Unlike any of those, Mr. Nobody has philosophical underpinning inspired by scientific tomes on chaos theory and the butterfly effect, pigeon superstition, and the space-time continuum. Van Dormael stated, [...] "My starting point was a 12-minute short I made in 1982 called È pericoloso sporgersi. A kid runs behind a train with two possible choices: to go with his mother or with his father. From there we follow two possible futures. I started one version {{based on the fact}} that a woman jumps or doesn't jump on a train. Then Sliding Doors by Peter Howitt came out, followed by Run Lola Run by Tom Tykwer. I had to find something else. And that's when I realised that the story I was trying to tell was not binary, that I was above all interested by the multiplicity and complexity of choices. With this screenplay I wanted to make the viewer feel the abyss that is the infinity of possibilities. Beyond this, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a different way of telling a story. I wanted the gaze of the child on his future to meet the gaze of the old man he has become on his past. I wanted to talk about complexity through cinema, which is a simplifying medium. While reality around us is more and more complex, the information is more and more succinct, political speeches are more and more simplistic. What interests me is complexity. Not the simple answers, which are reassuring but bound to be false." ...|$|E

The agreement included the production and creation of several beauty and personal care products and it was stated that [...] "Shakira will develop, with a dedicated team, {{the creation of the}} product line from inception to completion". The distribution of the products and the creation of [...] "strategic alliances" [...] were chosen to be solely the responsibility of the company. Shakira expressed her views about the partnership, saying [...] "I am very excited to be able to express myself through another creative medium. “My feeling is that personal care and beauty should be effortless and accessible for everyone." [...] Interested in perfumery and conveying [...] "emotions through aromas", the singer decided to take the idea further and began exploring various scents. The development of the perfume took three years to complete and Shakira compared the process to composing a song, opining that [...] "It's similar to the process you go through when writing a melody: certain chord combinations inspire different feelings in the listener. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a way of expressing the feeling of pure happiness through the medium of fragrance". José Manuel Albesa, chief brand officer of Puig, commented that Shakira was completely involved {{in the process of developing}} the fragrance and was [...] "extremely hands-on". Didier Maine de Biran, general manager of Puig USA, opined that S by Shakira was different from other celebrity-branded fragrances, saying [...] "What makes this stand out is how involved she [...] was. The key difference is she has the knowledge of what she wants and really wants to share it with her fans. She's involved. She's committed. And it is just a great fragrance that stands on its own".|$|E

I felt that my vision was choosing things {{out there in}} the world and presenting them. To me the investigation of perception was of the greatest interest. There was so much to see, and it all looked fantastic to me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fischer {{has written}} about the concept of God being {{integral}} to Judaism and many other religions. In his book Opening to You: Zen-Inspired Translations of the Psalms (Viking, 2002), Fischer replaced the words [...] "God", [...] "King", and [...] "Lord" [...] with the word [...] "You." [...] He explains:"For many of the religious seekers I encounter, the word God has been all but emptied of its spiritual power. The relationship to God that is charted out in the Psalms is a stormy one, co-dependent, passionate, confusing, loyal, petulant, sometimes even manipulative. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a way to approach these poems so as to emphasize the relational aspect, while avoiding the major distancing pitfalls that words like God, King, Lord and so on create." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, {{following}} {{reports that}} Kelis {{had been working}} with producer Dave Sitek, {{it was announced that}} she had signed to Sitek's own record label Federal Prism and was going to release two albums. A new single, [...] "Jerk Ribs" [...] premiered online the same month. In late 2013, it was announced that Kelis had signed to British independent label Ninja Tune for the release of the album, titled Food, in April 2014. Food is produced entirely by Sitek and contains influences of soul, funk, gospel, and AfrobeatKelis said of the album, [...] "You know, those records in your life that your parents played and they resonate with who you are? They make you nostalgic. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out how to get that feeling." [...] Food entered the UK Albums Chart at number 20, becoming Kelis's second highest peaking album after Tasty in 2004. In the U.S., it reached number 73 on the Billboard 200.|$|E
2500|$|Safina {{was born}} in Moscow, Russia to Tatar parents. Her mother, Rauza Islanova, was her trainer when she was younger; while her father is {{director}} of the Spartak tennis club in Moscow. Her brother Marat is a former world No. 1 on the ATP Tour. Speaking of growing up in such a successful tennis family, Safina stated: [...] "Being the little sister in such a big tennis family is not an easy situation. Maybe that's why it took me longer to develop. My father is very competitive, but my parents didn't put pressure on me. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> my identity. I wanted to be something by myself, like being a big player by myself. So at the beginning I was putting too much pressure on myself. But then gradually I found myself, and I learned how to do better with that situation." [...] At age 8, Safina and her family moved to Valencia, Spain, and as a result Safina speaks fluent Spanish as well as Russian and English.|$|E

2500|$|Talking {{about the}} title track [...] "Louder", Michele has said, [...] "It's a song that, no matter what, I can play in my car with the windows down. I feel like it shows off my voice as a singer, which is really {{important}} to me, because that’s what I do. I {{want to make sure}} that every song on my record is fun and enjoyable, but also, you hear my voice in them." [...] Michele also stated, [...] "I didn't want to find songs that I had to change myself for. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> songs that would only highlight my sound and were unique to me. I didn't want to fit any mold. I wanted it to be something that couldn't be replicated by anyone else. It was important to me that the album began with [...] "Cannonball" [...] and ended with [...] "If You Say So". I have to acknowledge what I've been through this year. It was really difficult, which I think is represented in [...] "If You Say So" [...] and a song like [...] "Cannonball" [...] represents finding strength and hope. These are the two sides of my life right now. The grief, but also the search for strength and hope. I really wanted those two songs to bookend the album. Really let everyone know where I'm at." ...|$|E
