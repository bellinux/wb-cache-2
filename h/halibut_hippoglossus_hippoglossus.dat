50|$|They {{are found}} on the bottoms of oceans around the world, with some species, such as the Atlantic <b>halibut,</b> <b>Hippoglossus</b> <b>hippoglossus,</b> being found down to 2000 m. The smaller species eat sea-floor {{invertebrates}} such as polychaetes and crustaceans, but the larger righteye flounders, such as H. hippoglossus, which grows up to 4.7 m in length, feed on other fishes and cephalopods, as well.|$|E
50|$|The roughhead {{grenadier}} is landed as a by-catch when fishing for Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) and Atlantic <b>halibut</b> (<b>Hippoglossus</b> <b>hippoglossus).</b> In a study off {{the east coast}} of Greenland, more males were taken by trawling and more females by long line. This seemed to be due to the females being in the depth range 1000 to 1500 m while the males predominated at shallower depths.|$|E
50|$|The Atlantic <b>halibut</b> (<b>Hippoglossus</b> <b>hippoglossus)</b> is a {{flatfish}} of {{the family}} Pleuronectidae. They are demersal fish living on or near sand, gravel or clay bottoms at depths of between 50 and 2000 m. The halibut is among the largest teleost (bony) fish in the world, and is an endangered species due to a slow rate of growth and previous overfishing. Halibut are strong swimmers {{and are able to}} migrate long distances. Halibut size is not age-specific, but rather tends to follow a cycle related to halibut (and therefore food) abundance.|$|E

50|$|As expected, teleosts (bony fish) are not {{repelled}} by the electropositive metal’s cation liberation in seawater. This is because teleosts lack the ampullae of Lorenzini. Teleost response was confirmed using captive Cobia (Rachycentron canadum) and Pacific <b>halibut</b> (<b>Hippoglossus</b> stenolepis). In July 2008 swordfish (Xiphias gladius) catch was reported on experimental hooks treated with electropositive metal.|$|R
5000|$|The wild Atlantic halibut was {{formerly}} {{a very important}} food fish, but due to its slow rate of population growth, it is unable to recover quickly from overfishing, and the fishery has largely collapsed.

Characterization {{of active}} {{spawning}} season and depth for eastern Pa-cific <b>halibut</b> (<b>Hippoglossus</b> stenolepis), {{and evidence of}} probable skipped spawning. J. Northw. Atl. Fish. Sci., 41 : 23 – 36. doi: 10. 2960 /J. v 41. m 617 The eastern Pacific <b>halibut</b> (<b>Hippoglossus</b> stenolepis) fishery is prosecuted over a nine-month season with a provision to cease harvests if stock declines to historically-observed minimum spawn-ing biomass. The industry has requested to extend fishing into winter, but little information exists regarding potential impacts on spawning aggregations or effective spawning biomass. A strictly an-nual spawning cycle is presumed, but some adults fail to undertake the offshore migration associated with continental slope spawning. We examined depth records of halibut tagged with Pop-up Archival Transmitting (PAT) tags for evidence of offshore seasonal migration (n = 72). For tags that were physically recovered (n = 16) we identified the occurrence of abrupt (~ 100 m) mid-winter ascents, believed to be egg release. The active spawning season, defined by occurrence of these rises, lasted from 27 December– 8 March, at bottom depths of 278 – 594 m. Eighteen percent of tagged halibut remained onshore. Thirty-one percent of fish with detailed archival records did not exhibit spawnin...|$|R

50|$|The treaty {{established}} the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) {{as a mechanism}} for the joint management of the Pacific <b>halibut</b> (<b>Hippoglossus</b> stenolepis) which, at that time, was in severe decline. The commission originally had four members but now has six, which are selected from industry and related government agencies. Half the members are Canadian and half are from the United States. The treaty also had a provision for a closed season, so halibut could not be fished during the more dangerous winter months. The treaty has been revised numerous times, often based on recommendations from the IPHC and its team of scientific researchers.|$|R
