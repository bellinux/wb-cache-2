The rear frontage of the hotel faces the nearby Saint Catherine's Dock, completing an attractive surrounding in one of the paradoxically least developed areas of the city, and which has been taken least advantage of. &# 13; Total construction occupies an area of 36, 560 m 2 arranged in 15 storeys, on the ground floor, plus a basement <b>for</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>installations</b> and car-parks. &# 13; The programme includes: 704 double rooms; 111 single rooms; 8 suites; 95 rooms for hotel staff; restaurant facilities; bar and cafeteria; three conference rooms; a public gallery for different uses; kitchens, several floors for mechanical installations; underground garage; canteen and rooms for staff, and management offices. Ha sido construido a orillas del Támesis, y debe su nombre a la proximidad de la Torre de Londres, que igualmente nominó al antiguo Tower Bridge, puente sobre el río, situado a escasos metros del edificio. La fachada posterior del hotel se orienta hacia la inmediata Dársena de Santa Catalina, completando un entorno atractivo en una de las zonas paradójicamente peor aprovechadas de la ciudad. &# 13; La construcción ocupa una edificabilidad total de 36. 560 m 2 organizados en 15 plantas, sobre rasante, más un sótano dedicado a las instalaciones mecánicas y a aparcamientos. &# 13; El programa comprende: 704 habitaciones dobles; 111 individuales; 8 suites; 95 habitaciones para el personal del hotel; servicios de restaurante; bar y cafetería; tres salas de conferencias; una galería pública de funcionamiento diverso; cocinas; varias plantas mecánicas de instalaciones; garaje subterráneo; comedor y salas para el personal, y oficinas de administración...|$|E

40|$|Improved spatial quality {{contributes}} to the attractiveness and public image of a building, {{as well as to}} users' well-being. This article identifies spatial quality determinants that are affected by renovation in residential buildings. We performed a detailed assessment of changes in spatial quality due to <b>mechanical</b> <b>installations</b> in renovation. The article presents two main findings. First we identified common spatial quality determinants in the research literature: view, privacy, lighting, spatiality, spatial arrangements, the transition between public and private spaces, and perceived, built, and human densities. Second we found that the available assessment for the renovation of dwellings covers only partially the impact of <b>mechanical</b> <b>installations</b> on spatiality. We suggest, based on these findings, a general spatial quality checklist to support architects, developers, and building owners. We probed deeper into the impact of <b>mechanical</b> <b>installations</b> on the spatiality of dwellings to propose a spatial quality assessment to be considered before and after renovation. The proposed assessment represents a further step toward the inclusion of spatial quality in building renovation processes, which benefits stakeholders from design professionals to end users...|$|R
