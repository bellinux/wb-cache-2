60|$|Mr. Trelawny got <b>knives</b> <b>and</b> <b>scissors</b> ready, {{and placed}} the cat on the table. It was a grim {{beginning}} to our work; and it made my heart sink when I thought of what might happen in that lonely house in the mid-gloom of the night. The sense of loneliness and isolation from the world was increased by the moaning of the wind which had now risen ominously, and by the beating of waves on the rocks below. But we had too grave a task before us to be swayed by external manifestations: the unrolling of the mummy began.|$|E
60|$|Accordingly we {{sent two}} shallops, or large boats, which carried {{together}} sixty men, all well armed. We gave them store of beads and <b>knives</b> <b>and</b> <b>scissors,</b> and such baubles with them, with hatchets and nails, and hooks, looking-glasses, and the like; and we built {{up the sides}} and sterns of the boats, and covered them with boards, to keep off arrows and darts, if they should find occasion, so that they looked like London barges. In this posture, {{as soon as the}} tide or flood was made up, our men went away, carrying a drum and a trumpet in each boat; and each boat had also two patereroes, or small cannon, fixed on the gunnel near the bow.|$|E

A very disrespectful and ridiculous fancy of course; for he was doing all that could be done, and the arm prospered finely in his hands. But the human mind is prone to prejudice; and though a personable man, {{speaking}} French like a born [...] "Parley voo," [...] and whipping off legs like an animated guillotine, I must confess to a sense of relief when he was ordered elsewhere; and suspect that several of the men would have faced a rebel battery with less trepidation than they did Dr. P., when he came briskly in on his morning round.|$|E

25|$|On 14 January 1949, {{staff at}} the Adelaide railway station {{discovered}} a brown suitcase with its label removed, which had been checked into the station cloakroom after 11:00a.m. on 30 November 1948. It was believed that the suitcase was owned by the man found on the beach. In the case were a red checked dressing gown; a size seven, red felt pair of slippers; four pairs of underpants; pyjamas; shaving items; a light brown pair of trousers with sand in the cuffs; an electrician's screwdriver; a table knife cut down into a short sharp instrument; {{a pair of scissors}} with sharpened points; a small square of zinc thought to have been used as a protective sheath for the <b>knife</b> <b>and</b> <b>scissors</b> <b>and</b> a stencilling brush, as used by third officers on merchant ships for stencilling cargo.|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the possibility of}} inflicting serious injuries with sharp objects in an experimental setting by throwing four sharp objects from different distances and with different throwing techniques. Using an overarm-handle (OA/H), overarm-blade (OA/B), underarm-handle (UA/H), underarm-blade (UA/B) and thrust (T/H) throwing technique, 10 adults (sex ratio 1 : 1) threw a chef's knife, a skinning knife, a paring <b>knife</b> <b>and</b> office <b>scissors</b> from 4 m and 2 m distance at synthetic abdomen models made of 10 % gelatin covered with synthetic skin. The amount of hits and penetrations of the target and their penetration depth were noted, as was {{the rotation of the}} blade tip towards the target along its flight trajectory. The chef's knife injury/hit ratio was 0. 167 / 4 m and 0. 160 / 2 m; the skinning knife recorded an injury/hit ratio of 0. 087 / 4 m and 0. 153 / 2 m; the paring knife of 0. 087 / 4 m and 0. 113 / 2 m; <b>and</b> the <b>scissors</b> 0. 087 / 4 m and 0. 067 / 2 m. Mean penetration depths were as follows: the chef's knife: 4 m, 4. 42 cm, 2 m, 3. 41 cm; the skinning knife: 4 m, 4. 19 cm, 2 m, 4. 11 cm; the paring knife: 4 m, 1. 62 cm, 2 m, 1. 55 cm; and the scissors: 4 m, 2. 08 cm, 2 m, 0. 95 cm. Handle-throw penetration-depths were: 4 m: 3. 77 cm and 2 m: 2. 86 cm; blade-throw depths were: 4 m: 3. 14 cm and 2 m: 2. 69 cm. Overarm-throw penetration-depths were: 4 m: 3. 62 cm and 2 m: 3. 25 cm; and underarm-throw penetration-depths were 4 m: 3. 30 cm and 2 m: 2. 30 cm. No thrust-throws with the paring <b>knife</b> <b>and</b> <b>scissors</b> could pierce the target. The tips pointed toward the target at angles of 60 °- 120 °, earlier in handle-throws than blade-throws, especially with the paring <b>knife</b> <b>and</b> the <b>scissors.</b> When thrown, especially with a handle-held technique, heavier objects pierced more often and more deeply. Thrust-throws at short distances are unlikely to pierce a human...|$|R
60|$|I {{took out}} the bottles and pots and brushes and combs, the <b>knives</b> <b>and</b> <b>scissors</b> in one compartment, the writing {{materials}} in another. I smelled the perfumes and pomatums; I busily cleaned and dusted the bottles with my handkerchief as I took them out. Little by little I completely emptied the dressing-case. It was lined with blue velvet. In one corner I noticed a tiny slip of loose blue silk. Taking it between my finger and thumb, and drawing it upward, I discovered {{that there was a}} false bottom to the case, forming a secret compartment for letters and papers. In my strange condition--capricious, idle, inquisitive--it was an amusement to me to take out the papers, just as I had taken out everything else.|$|E
60|$|A {{table was}} now spread with phials, boxes of salve, and divers {{surgical}} instruments. As the latter appeared in succession, from {{a case of}} red morocco, their owner held up each implement to the strong light of the chandelier, near to which he stood, and examined it with the nicest care. A red silk handkerchief was frequently applied to the glittering steel, as if to remove from the polished surfaces the least impediment which might exist to the most delicate operation. After the rather scantily furnished pocket-case which contained these instruments was exhausted, the physician turned to his saddle-bags, and produced various phials, filled with liquids of the most radiant colors. These were arranged in due order {{by the side of}} the murderous saws, <b>knives,</b> <b>and</b> <b>scissors,</b> when Elnathan stretched his long body to its utmost elevation, placing his hand on the small of his back as if for sup port, and looked about him to discover what effect this display of professional skill was likely to produce on the spectators.|$|E
60|$|When their promised {{visit to}} the Park and {{consequent}} introduction to these young ladies took place, they found in {{the appearance of the}} eldest, who was nearly thirty, with a very plain and not a sensible face, nothing to admire; but in the other, who was not {{more than two or three}} and twenty, they acknowledged considerable beauty; her features were pretty, and she had a sharp quick eye, and a smartness of air, which though it did not give actual elegance or grace, gave distinction to her person.-- Their manners were particularly civil, and Elinor soon allowed them credit for some kind of sense, when she saw with what constant and judicious attention they were making themselves agreeable to Lady Middleton. With her children they were in continual raptures, extolling their beauty, courting their notice, and humouring their whims; and such of their time as could be spared from the importunate demands which this politeness made on it, was spent in admiration of whatever her ladyship was doing, if she happened to be doing any thing, or in taking patterns of some elegant new dress, in which her appearance the day before had thrown them into unceasing delight. Fortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles, a fond mother, though, in pursuit of praise for her children, the most rapacious of human beings, is likewise the most credulous; her demands are exorbitant; but she will swallow any thing; and the excessive affection and endurance of the Miss Steeles towards her offspring were viewed therefore by Lady Middleton without the smallest surprise or distrust. She saw with maternal complacency all the impertinent encroachments and mischievous tricks to which her cousins submitted. She saw their sashes untied, their hair pulled about their ears, their work-bags searched, and their <b>knives</b> <b>and</b> <b>scissors</b> stolen away, and felt no doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment. It suggested no other surprise than that Elinor and Marianne should sit so composedly by, without claiming a share in what was passing.|$|E

During an interrogation he assaulted a custodial judge after jumping over two tables, until he was subdued by a guard. For this, he was {{convicted and sentenced to}} eight months in prison. On March 28, Wisniewski attempted to escape from prison. Somehow, he acquired a <b>knife</b> <b>and</b> <b>scissors,</b> which he used to overcome a guard.

While being returned to his cell, Wisniewski attacked the director of the jail with a sock filled with batteries. During the trial, which took several months, Wisniewski went on hunger strike, but was force-fed. On December 4, 1981, Stefan Wisniewski was convicted and {{sentenced to life in prison}} for murder, kidnapping, coercion of a constitutional body, and membership in a terrorist organization.

6000|$|For {{most of our}} uses it {{generally}} is so; and because we cannot use a rusty knife or razor so well as a polished one, we suppose {{it to be a}} great defect in iron that it is subject to rust. But not at all. On the contrary, the most perfect and useful state of it is that ochreous stain; and therefore it is endowed with so ready a disposition to get itself into that state. It is not a fault in the iron, but a virtue, to be so fond of getting rusted, for in that condition it fulfils its most important functions in the universe, and most kindly duties to mankind. Nay, in a certain sense, and almost a literal one, we may say that iron rusted is Living; but when pure or polished, Dead. You all probably know that in the mixed air we breathe, the part of it essentially needful to us is called oxygen; and that this substance is to all animals, in the most accurate sense of the word, [...] "breath of life." [...] The nervous power of life is a different thing; but the supporting element of the breath, without which the blood, and therefore the life, cannot be nourished, is this oxygen. Now it is this very same air which the iron breathes when it gets rusty. It takes the oxygen from the atmosphere as eagerly as we do, though it uses it differently. The iron keeps all that it gets; we, and other animals, part with it again; but the metal absolutely keeps what it has once received of this aerial gift; and the ochreous dust which we so much despise is, in fact, just so much nobler than pure iron, in so far as it is iron and the air. Nobler, and more useful--for, indeed, as I shall be able to show you presently--the main service of this metal, and of all other metals, to us, is not in making <b>knives,</b> <b>and</b> <b>scissors,</b> and pokers, and pans, but in making the ground we feed from, and nearly all the substances first needful to our existence. For these are all nothing but metals and oxygen--metals with breath put into them. Sand, lime, clay, {{and the rest of the}} earths--potash and soda, and the rest of the alkalies--are all of them metals which have undergone this, so to speak, vital change, and have been rendered fit for the service of man by permanent unity with the purest air which he himself breathes. There is only one metal which does not rust readily; and that, in its influence on Man hitherto, has caused Death rather than Life; it will not be put to its right use till it is made a pavement of, and so trodden under foot.|$|E
