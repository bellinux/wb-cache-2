Additionally, <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> harbor would be ice-bound for nine {{months out of the}} year. In the end, due to the financial infeasibility of the project and the concerns over radiation-related health issues, the project was abandoned in 1962.|$|E
5|$|French {{military}} planners had to balance competing demands for the 1781 campaign. After the unsuccessful American attempts of co-operation leading to failed assaults at Rhode Island and Savannah, they realised more {{active participation in}} North America was needed. However, they also needed to co-ordinate their actions with Spain, where there was potential interest in making {{an assault on the}} British stronghold of Jamaica. <b>It</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Spanish were not interested in operations agaynst Jamaica until after they had dealt with an expected British attempt to reinforce besieged Gibraltar, and merely wanted to be informed of the movements of the West Indies fleet.|$|E
5|$|Harrison Scott, {{a retired}} engineer, was {{traveling}} north on I-5 {{with his son}} in 1991, when his son speculated about the difficulty of driving over the first road through the rugged terrain. Having some extra time, and recalling a drive on the old road in 1955, they left the freeway and traveled along most of the abandoned section. Near SR138, Scott asked a county road crew which was resurfacing the road if it was still maintained by the county, and the crew replied that they didn't know who maintained it through the desert. <b>It</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> county officially owned it but did not maintain it; Scott has since convinced the county and forest to exchange ownership with the Santa Anita Canyon Road, then a county road.|$|E

5|$|The Germans did not {{mount an}} all-out {{infantry}} {{assault on the}} divisional area, which was under continuous mortar and artillery attack. Instead, each sector was subjected to small scale assaults at times supported by tanks or self-propelled guns. Enemy troops first attacked the Independent Company, then the Borders who were forced off the high ground overlooking the river, and finally the KOSB. The Germans mounted a strong assault following the landing of the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade south of the river beside Driel. This attack forced the KOSB out of their positions, which were only regained after a bayonet charge. Fighting was so fierce that first reports suggested the KOSB had been annihilated, although <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> counter-attack had in fact reduced the battalion's strength to only 150 men.|$|E
5|$|In {{that race}} at Brands Hatch, Pryce took an unfancied Royale RP11 to {{first place in}} the Formula Three support race for the 1972 Formula One Race of Champions against many {{established}} Formula Three drivers such as Roger Williamson, Jochen Mass and James Hunt. So large was Pryce's advantage {{at the end of the}} race, many of the other teams voiced an opinion that Pryce's car had run the race underweight; <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> circuit's weighbridge certificate had expired and everyone's cars had been underweight. Pryce retired from the leading group in the following two rounds at Oulton Park and Zandvoort, and then during practice for the support race of the 1972 Monaco Grand Prix his car came to a stop at Casino Square after a wire had come loose. He had exited his car to correct the problem when Peter Lamplough lost control of his car and struck the Royale RP11. Pryce was knocked into a shop window and broke a leg.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur's {{next move}} was the {{invasion}} of Mindoro, where there were good potential airfield sites. Willoughby estimated, correctly as <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> island had only about 1,000 Japanese defenders. The problem this time was getting there. Kinkaid balked at sending escort carriers into the restricted waters of the Sulu Sea, and Kenney could not guarantee land based air cover. The operation was clearly hazardous, and MacArthur's staff talked him out of accompanying the invasion on Nashville. As the invasion force entered the Sulu Sea, a kamikaze struck Nashville, killing 133 people and wounding 190 more. Australian and American engineers had three airstrips in operation within two weeks, but the resupply convoys were repeatedly attacked by kamikazes. During this time, MacArthur quarreled with Sutherland, notorious for his abrasiveness, over the latter's mistress, Captain Elaine Clark. MacArthur had instructed Sutherland not to be bring Clark to Leyte, due to a personal undertaking to Curtin that Australian women on the GHQ staff would not {{be taken to the}} Philippines, but Sutherland had brought her along anyway.|$|E

5|$|Many {{people in}} Halifax at first {{believed}} the explosion {{to be the}} result of a German attack. The Halifax Herald continued to propagate this belief for some time, for example reporting that Germans had mocked victims of the explosion. While John Johansen, the Norwegian helmsman of Imo, was being treated for serious injuries sustained during the explosion, it was reported to the military police that he had been behaving suspiciously. Johansen was arrested on suspicions of being a German spy when a search turned up a letter on his person, supposedly written in German. <b>It</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> letter was actually written in Norwegian. Immediately following the explosion, most of the German survivors in Halifax had been rounded up and imprisoned. Eventually the fear dissipated as the real cause of the explosion became known, although rumours of German involvement persisted.|$|E
5|$|The first {{services}} {{started on}} 1 July 1907 from Voss to Myrdal. An official opening train attempted to cross {{part of the}} line to Gulsvik on 9 December 1907, but got stuck in heavy snow and had to return. <b>It</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> railway had to close and it took {{one and a half}} months to clear it for snow. Even a rotary snowplow at 750kW was not powerful enough {{to get rid of the}} snow. A new attempt to open the line in 1908 succeeded, and a train went from Gulsvik to Bergen. The line from Roa to Gulsvik was still under construction, so passage was along the Drammen Line via the Krøder Line with ship over Krøderen to Gulsvik. The first scheduled train from Oslo West Station en route to Bergen departed 10 June 1908.|$|E
5|$|While the {{question}} of whether Fermi's experiment had produced element 93 was stalemated, two additional claims of the discovery of the element appeared, although unlike Fermi, they both claimed to have observed it in nature. The first of these claims was by Czech engineer Odolen Koblic in 1934 when he extracted a small amount of material from the wash water of heated pitchblende. He proposed the name bohemium for the element, but after being analyzed <b>it</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sample was a mixture of tungsten and vanadium. The other claim, in 1938 by Romanian physicist Horia Hulubei and French chemist Yvette Cauchois, claimed to have discovered the new element via spectroscopy in minerals. They named their element sequanium, but the claim was discounted because the prevailing theory at the time was that if it existed at all, element 93 would not exist naturally. However, as neptunium does in fact occur in nature in trace amounts, as demonstrated when it was found in uranium ore in 1952, it is possible that Hulubei and Cauchois did in fact observe neptunium.|$|E

5|$|After the débâcle at Ypres, the bishop's forces divided, some {{going back}} to England, some {{remaining}} with the bishop and others under Sir Thomas Trivet and Sir Hugh Calveley retiring to Bourbourg and Bergues. The bishop and Calveley had wished to advance into France, but Sir William Elmham, Trivet {{and some of the}} other commanders refused to go. The bishop, after entering Picardy for some distance, was obliged to fall back upon Gravelines. <b>It</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> French had little stomach for a showdown with the English and their allies, preferring instead to negotiate: part of the French army was unwilling to fight when Despenser and Calveley encountered it when moving towards Picardy. It is possible that had King Richard crossed the Channel with a large English army, the campaign would have ended in a famous victory. However, for the demoralised and disease-ridden English forces, the arrival of the French headed by the boy-king Charles VI was decisive. Charles had taken the oriflamme on 2 August and his army was mustered in Arras on 15 August. They advanced into Flanders, reaching Thérouanne by the end of August, Drincham on 5 September, Bergues on 7 September (forcing Trivet's and Elmham's retreat to Bourbourg and Gravelines) and Dunkirk on 9 September. Bourbourg was besieged on 12 September: two days later the Duke of Brittany persuaded the French to negotiate a surrender and the English garrison was given safe conduct from the town. The French army then proceeded along the coast and besieged Gravelines. There, without Despenser's authority, the defenders accepted bribes and the bishop's treasurer pocketed 5000 francs. Despenser at first refused the surrender terms, but a few days later Gravelines was evacuated and Despenser ordered it to be sacked. By the end of October the remaining crusaders had returned across the English Channel.|$|E
