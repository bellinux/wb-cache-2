50|$|A new {{quantity}} commitment approach, {{suggested by}} Mutsuyoshi Nishimura, {{is for all}} countries to commit to the same global <b>emission</b> <b>target.</b> The “assembly of governments” would issue permits {{in the amount of}} the global target and all upstream fossil-fuel providers would be forced to buy these permits. All permits would be auctioned by the assembly which would also negotiate how to distribute the revenues. Such a set of commitments, if kept, would form a true quantity-based carbon pricing policy, and result in an efficient uniform global carbon price. However, this would not necessarily be the correct price, which would depend on the chosen global <b>emission</b> <b>target.</b> How the revenues would be distributed would undoubtedly prove to be a contentious problem.|$|E

50|$|An {{emission}} reduction commitment, sometimes called an <b>emission</b> <b>target,</b> is a quantity-based commitment. It differs from a cap because a country can emit more provided it buys carbon permits {{from another country}} (that over-satisfies its commitment). Also, such commitments need {{not lead to a}} price on carbon, but can be met by non-price policies. Under the Kyoto Protocol, Annex I countries made {{emission reduction}} commitments. These commitments did not specify which policy would be used to achieve them, but the EU among others hoped that a set of linked national cap-and-trade markets would develop and that carbon pricing {{would be one of the}} most significant policies in achieving emission reductions. In reality, the EU ETS and its carbon price did play an important role as did the more ambiguous pricing of the Clean Development Mechanism and its permits, Certified Emission Reduction Units (CERs). However, renewables subsidies undermined the carbon price significantly as well as the efficiency of the emission reduction process.|$|E

50|$|Their {{lightweight}} properties {{have also}} made tolerance rings attractive to automotive manufacturers as they seek to enhance car performance while complying with government requirements for reductions in carbon emissions. In the European Union, regulations on car emissions have been introduced by the European Commission, restricting {{the amount of carbon}} dioxide (CO2) emissions that a car can emit. Since 2015, EU law requires that new cars do not emit more than 130 grams per kilometer of carbon dioxide (CO2). If that limit is breached then manufacturers can face fines. From 2021 the new mandatory <b>emission</b> <b>target</b> will be a fleet average of 95 grams per kilometer. China is beginning to introduce legislation to create a National Standard, based on carbon emission reduction regulations already in effect in Europe. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires automotive companies to average carbon dioxide (CO2) tailpipe emissions at 101 grams per kilometer (163 grams/mile) by model year 2025. These regulations require car manufacturers to reduce the weight of their engines and vehicles to enhance fuel efficiency. According to the EPA estimations, every 10 per cent drop in car mass decreases fuel use between 5 and 10 per cent.|$|E
5000|$|National {{reduction}} obligations in {{any year}} {{are defined as}} shares of the global mitigation gap, which is allocated among countries in proportion to their RCI. The US, for example (see Figure 2) is projected to have a 2020 reduction obligation equal to 29.1% of the roughly 4 Gigatonnes of carbon mitigation that will then be needed. In general, each country is given an <b>emission</b> <b>target</b> equal to its reference trajectory minus its proportional share of the global mitigation gap. Distributing the global mitigation gap in this way yields some striking results. For one thing, it clearly shows that a major commitment to North-South cooperation - including financial and technological transfers - is an inevitable part of any viable global climate stabilization architecture. This is because the national mitigation obligations of the high-RCI countries of the North vastly exceed the reductions they could conceivably make at home. In fact, by 2030, northern mitigation obligations typically come to exceed even their total domestic emissions. Which {{is to say that}} wealthier and higher emitting countries would receive “negative allocations,” as is necessary in order to open enough atmospheric space for the developing world. This kind of negative allocation can never arise under frameworks that seek to allocate “emission rights.” ...|$|E

Thus, one can observe that the accounting policy on “producer based” could cause “carbon import” and that, on the contrary, carbon control on “trade-adjusted” or “demand-based” emission accounting may cause larger “carbon export” effects which can harm the global carbon emission control target. It {{should be noted}} that the above two “leakage” patterns disappear when carbon <b>emission</b> <b>target</b> is agreed by all countries. Third, the outcome of partial participation seems small. These findings suggest how the carbon control measures should be implemented.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{enhanced}} optimization formulation {{to help determine}} the type of power generation mix that can meet a given carbon <b>emission</b> <b>target</b> at the minimum cost. Compared to the previous studies, the model proposed in this paper takes account of the emission cost at operational level and explores its impacts on the long-term <b>emission</b> <b>target</b> oriented generation planning innovatively. Meanwhile, the model is able {{to take account of}} the integer variables and nonlinearity of the operational cost together with network constraints and renewable generation expansion in one long-term generation planning model. The problem is solved by an innovative discrete gradient search method, and a new concept, emission reduction cost (ERC), is developed, which helps determine which generation technology is the most cost efficient in emission reduction during different stages of generation expansion. A case study on a modified IEEE 30 -bus system is presented to demonstrate the application of this model and the value of considering short-term emission costs and the network constraints on the long-term generation expansion. The results and sensitivity analysis are provided to show that a higher short-term financial pressure can help realize the <b>emission</b> <b>target</b> at a lower total cost (investment and operational costs). Optimization without considering it may overestimate the total cost required for the generation mix restructuring. Additionally, a comparative study shows that optimization without considering network constraints may underestimate the total cost required for realizing the specified emission reduction target...|$|E
