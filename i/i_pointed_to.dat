40|$|This paper {{represents}} a socio-musical {{analysis of the}} importance {{and the role of}} the concert in 19 th-century musical life. I describe characteristics of the concert as a social event, explain social mechanisms that made possible the constitution and existence of the concert, <b>point</b> <b>to</b> the importance of the social changes on the way this institution functioned, and <b>I</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> the certain values that were being made through the concert. Special attention is devoted to the analysis of different types of concerts, as well as to the causes and the consequences of those differences among them. Analyzing the concert as a social institution, I show the relations that exist between divergent behavior patterns that were made through the concerts, and <b>I</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> the effects the concert had on the cultural life of a certain historical period...|$|R

40|$|Existing formalisations of (transfinite) {{inductive}} definitions in constructive mathematics {{are reviewed}} and strong correspondences with LP under least model and perfect model semantics become apparent. <b>I</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> fundamental restrictions of these existing formalisations {{and argue that}} the well-founded semantics (wfs) overcomes these problems and hence, provides a superior formalisation {{of the principle of}} inductive definition. The contribution of this study for LP is that it (re-) introduces the knowledge theoretic interpretation of LP as a logic for representing definitional knowledge. <b>I</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> fundamental differences between this knowledge theoretic interpretation of LP and the more commonly known interpretations of LP as default theories or auto-epistemic theories. The relevance is that differences in knowledge theoretic interpretation have strong impact on knowledge representation methodology and on extensions of the LP formalism, for example for representing uncertainty.

40|$|In this paper, I {{present a}} vision of the {{corporation}} as a moral person. <b>I</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> “the separation of ownership and control” as a moment when the corporation broke away from the moral lives of ownermanagers. I then draw out the manner in which we can speak of the company as a moral person. Finally, through a discussion of social reporting in two British banks, <b>I</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> a shift in how this moral personhood is articulated, with the rise of corporate governance—or doing business well—as its own foundation of corporate responsibility. I propose a view of corporate responsibility as a “transmission mechanism” for the company’s role in moral life, situated in the broader social conception of “moral economy. ” This viewpoint sets out landscapes of legitimation and justification through which the ties that underpin economic life are founded...|$|R

To that aim, he maps a logic program to a set of First Order Logic (FOL) equivalences. Motivated by the research in Nonmonotonic Reasoning, logic programming is currently often seen as a default logic or autoepistemic logic. In [10], Gelfond proposes a semantic [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Main {{contents}} of my diploma is a racial strukcture of {{countries of the}} European Union and national conflicts concern on european nationals and nationalities. After specification of territories the treatise tries to define basic terminological notions of two views. Firstly it refers to substabtial difference from using of statistic notions having principle influence to quantification of minorities. Second view defines conceptions: nation and nationality of politic-geographical point of view. The sunbstantial space is dedicated to historic-geographical analysis of present national folder of the EU with view of chosen events of 20 th century. In the next charters I specify minorities-numbers and location, too. The last part deals with national conflicts where <b>I</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> typologies and <b>point</b> out causes of national competition inside the EU. For example it is the conflict Estonia-Russian tension. <b>I</b> <b>point</b> <b>to</b> its causes, development and suggest methods of solution to reduction of racial situation at the eastern border of Union...|$|R
