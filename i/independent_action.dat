5|$|While Germanicus enjoyed {{some success}} in his campaigns against Arminius and his allies, Tiberius decided not to attempt to conquer the Germans and {{recalled}} Germanicus to Rome. The effort {{it would have taken}} to conquer Germania Magna was deemed too great when compared with the low potential for profit from acquiring the new territory. Rome regarded Germany as a wild territory of forests and swamps, with little wealth compared to territories Rome already had. However, the campaign significantly healed the Roman psychological trauma from the Varus disaster, and greatly recovered Roman prestige. In addition to the recovery of two of the three lost eagles, Germanicus had fought Arminius, the leader who destroyed the three Roman legions in 9 AD, and defeated him in numerous battles. In leading his troops across the Rhine without recourse to Tiberius, he contradicted the advice of Augustus to keep that river as the boundary of the empire, and opened himself to potential doubts from Tiberius about his motives in taking such <b>independent</b> <b>action.</b> This error in political judgement gave Tiberius reason to controversially recall his nephew. Tacitus attributed the recall to Tiberius' jealousy of the glory Germanicus had acquired, and, with some bitterness, claims that Germanicus could have completed the conquest of Germania had he been given full independence of action.|$|E

40|$|Background: Low <b>independent</b> nurse <b>actions</b> {{leads to}} poor health care quality. Therefore, {{understanding}} the factors affecting <b>independent</b> nursing <b>action</b> is necessity. Objectives: This study aims to analysis the <b>independent</b> nurse <b>actions</b> and its related and predicting factors. Methods: This study used a cross-sectional design with observational technique for data collection. There were 165 nurses recruited using {{simple random sampling}} in 14 inpatient wards. Spearman Rank Correlation and multiple regressions were used for data analysis. Results: Results of {{this study showed that}} there were significant relationships of age, gender, education, employment time, family burden, working experience, knowledge, workload, and nurse ability with <b>independent</b> nursing <b>action</b> with p-value < 0. 05. Nurse knowledge is the most dominant factor predicting <b>independent</b> nursing <b>action</b> with R-value 0. 450. Conclusions: <b>Independent</b> nurse <b>actions</b> in daily living activities, caring & support, and rehabilitation were influenced by multiple factors such as nurse knowledge, ability, education and gender. Nurse knowledge is the most predicting factors affecting <b>independent</b> nursing <b>action.</b> Therefore, hospital and nurse managers need to well manage these predicting variables in order to improve <b>independent</b> nurse <b>action</b> that leads to the better quality of health service in the Dr. M.

Similarly, instructions on what to do if the fleet was instructed to take evasive action against torpedoes were amended. Commanders were given discretion that if their part of the fleet was not under immediate attack, they should continue engaging the enemy rather than turning away {{with the rest of the}} fleet. In this battle, when the fleet turned away from Scheer's destroyer attack covering his retreat, not all the British ships had been affected, and could have continued to engage the enemy.|$|E

500|$|On the Turkish side, by {{that night}} the 2nd Battalion 57th Infantry were on Baby 700, the 3rd Battalion, reduced to only ninety men, were at The Nek, and the 1st Battalion on Mortar Ridge. Just south {{of them was the}} 77th Infantry, next was the 27th Infantry {{opposite}} 400 Plateau. The last regiment, the 72nd Infantry, were on Battleship Hill. As for manpower, the Turks were in a similar situation to the ANZACs. Of the two regiments most heavily involved, the 57th had been destroyed, and the 27th were exhausted with heavy casualties. Large numbers of the 77th had deserted, and the regiment was in no condition to fight. The 72nd was largely intact, but they were a poorly trained force of Arab conscripts. The III Corps, having to deal with both landings, could not assist as they had no reserves available. It was not until 27 April that the 33rd and 64th Infantry Regiments arrived to reinforce the Turkish forces. The ANZACs, however, had been unable to achieve their obectives, and therefore dug in. Gallipoli, like the Western Front, turned into a war of attrition. The German commander, Liman von Saunders, was clear about the reasons for the outcome. He wrote that, [...] "on the Turkish side the situation was saved by the immediate and <b>independent</b> <b>action</b> of the 19th Division."

40|$|We {{present a}} {{concurrent}} operational Petri net semantics for the join-calculus, a process calculus for specifying concurrent and distributed systems. There often is {{a gap between}} system specifications and the actual implementations caused by synchrony assumptions on the specification side and asyn-chronously interacting components in implementations. The join-calculus is promising to reduce this gap by providing an abstract specification language which is asynchronously distributable. Classical process semantics establish an implicit order of actually <b>independent</b> <b>actions,</b> {{by means of an}} inter-leaving. So does the semantics of the join-calculus. To capture such <b>independent</b> <b>actions,</b> step-based semantics, e. g., as defined on Petri nets, are employed. Our Petri net semantics for the join-calculus induces step-behavior in a natural way. We prove our semantics behaviorally equivalent to the orig-inal join-calculus semantics by means of a bisimulation. We discuss how join specific assumptions influence an existing notion of distributability based on Petri nets. ...|$|R
