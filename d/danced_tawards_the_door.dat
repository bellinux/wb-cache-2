This study explored children's attitudes toward the elderly and aging using interviews and drawings. Third, fifth, and seventh grade students (N= 162) were asked to "draw a young person " and to "draw an old person " in addition to completing three subtests of <b>The</b> Children's Attitudes <b>Taward</b> <b>the</b> Elderly Scale. Results suggest that children in all grade levels display both positive as well as negative attitudes toward the aged and aging process. Fifty percent or more of each grade level reported old people to be helpful, friendly, wonderful, and good, whereas young people were reported to be just healthy. Overall, 60 - 70 % of each grade level gave a negative response when asked how they feel about getting old. Girls felt more positivel...|$|R

50|$|The {{operation}} of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> open button is transparent, immediately opening and holding <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> typically until a timeout occurs and <b>the</b> <b>door</b> closes. <b>The</b> {{operation of}} <b>the</b> <b>door</b> close button is less transparent, and it often appears to do nothing, leading to frequent but incorrect reports that <b>the</b> <b>door</b> close button is a placebo button: either not wired up at all, or inactive in normal service. Working {{door open and}} door close buttons are required by code in many jurisdictions, including the United States, specifically for emergency operation: in independent mode, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> open and door close buttons are used to manually open or close <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Beyond this, programming varies significantly, with some door close buttons immediately closing <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> but in other cases being delayed by an overall timeout, so <b>the</b> <b>door</b> cannot be closed until a few seconds after opening. In this case (hastening normal closure), <b>the</b> <b>door</b> close button has no effect. However, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> close button will cause a hall call to be ignored (so <b>the</b> <b>door</b> won't reopen), and once the timeout has expired, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> close will immediately close <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> for example to cancel a <b>door</b> open push. <b>The</b> minimum timeout for automatic <b>door</b> closing in <b>the</b> US is 5 seconds, which is a noticeable delay if not overridden.|$|R

50|$|A third {{strategy}} is to equip <b>the</b> <b>door</b> itself with a stopping mechanism. In this case, a short metal bar capped with rubber, or another high friction material, {{is attached to a}} hinge near the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> opposite <b>the</b> <b>door</b> hinge and on the side of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> which is in the direction that it closes. When <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is to be kept open, the bar is swung down so that the rubber end touches the floor. In this configuration, further movement of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> towards being closed increases the force on the rubber end, thereby increasing the frictional force which opposes the movement. When <b>the</b> <b>door</b> is to be closed, the stop is released by pushing <b>the</b> <b>door</b> slightly more open which releases the stop and allows it to be flipped upwards. A newer version of equipping <b>the</b> <b>door</b> with <b>the</b> stopping mechanism is to attach a magnet to the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> on <b>the</b> side which opens outward which then latches onto another magnet or magnetic material on the wall or a small hub on the floor. The magnet must be strong enough to hold the weight of <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> but weak enough to be easily detached from the wall or hub.|$|R
