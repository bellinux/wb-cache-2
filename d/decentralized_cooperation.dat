5000|$|In its [...] "decentralized" [...] dimension, {{international}} cooperation {{is a phenomenon}} that emerged following the Second World War, when local governments in Europe - especially those in France, which were active coordinators of this new form of interaction - signed twinning agreements, principally with German local governments, {{in order to promote}} peaceful coexistence and the reconstruction of Europe. At that time, the twinning agreements had a strong cultural and political character while <b>decentralized</b> <b>cooperation</b> had the overarching aim of maintaining peace in the postwar period. However, from the 1970s, the interdependence created by globalization in different fields combined with the evolution of the concept of cooperation (from an assistance-driven to a developmental approach) to elevate the nature of the agreements to another level. At that point, local governments, as they acquired greater autonomy, recognized the importance of international issues in their day-to-day processes and saw <b>decentralized</b> <b>cooperation</b> as a means of overcoming their regional limitations, whether economic, technological, social, or others. From then on, the international participation of local governments has been increasingly evident in practice.|$|E

Two estimates of Sun City's needs were carried out in November 2007 and January 2008 by the Shackles of Memory.These estimates enabled the Association to get better insight into Sun City's situation and to meet Mr Robert Duval, founding President of Haiti's Athletics Center - a sports (training) center for underprivileged children from Sun City. This association offers soccer, basketball, ping-pong and athletics training courses as well as hot meals and tutoring to over 1500 children from Sun City everyday. Haiti's Athletics Center was aimed at expanding its activities in a sector that would create jobs for Sun City's young workers, and thus created a green recycling center.

40|$|The n-player {{public goods}} game, the basic model of <b>decentralized</b> social <b>cooperation</b> in {{non-market}} settings, {{has a unique}} Nash equilibrium in which all players defect. The Folk Theorem asserts that near-Pareto-optimal pay-offs can be supported if the game is indefinitely repeated and the discount factor is sufficiently near unity. This paper advances {{the view that the}} Folk Theorem does not explain why or how individuals cooperate in these set-tings. First, with imperfect public signaling, the Folk Theorem’s implication that near-optimal payoffs do not depend on the number of players, given a fixed finite upper limit on the informational processing capacity of players, is based on an impermissible order of taking limits. Second, the Folk the-orem demonstrates the existence of an equilibrium, but does not show that this equilibrium can be implemented; i. e., that there is some plausible social process by means of which it can be instantiated. We offer a social imple-mentation mechanism using focal rules. This mechanism uses public signals that agents treat as common knowledge, so instances of cooperation based on the repeated public goods game must be publicly observable. The fact that no examples of cooperation based on the n-player public goods game (n> 2) with public focal rules has been observed suggests that modeling cooperation with self-regarding agents remains unsolved problem. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Existing formal {{models of}} social order have {{difficulty}} providing convincing accounts of stable cooperation within societies {{because they do}} not analyze the full range of institutional forms that are available for large collectivities. This paper presents a new model of cooperation within societies, based upon a nested hierarchies of groups. The problem of maintaining cooperation is viewed as isomorphic at each level, with successful enforcement of cooperation at one level allowing a group to be treated as unitary entity at the next. This allows for comparison of the efficiency {{of a wide range of}} institutional structures within a fairly simple model. Finally, the effect of particularistic factors (in the form of member dependence) on the costs of maintaining cooperation within groups is analyzed, as are its effects on optimal institutional structure. A recent revival of interest in the problem of order has been enriched by rational choice models that focus on management of cooperation within groups, societies and the international arena. The literature on <b>decentralized</b> ("anarchic") <b>cooperation,</b> in which all members of society are responsible for enforcing prescribed actions upon one another, has now become a genre unto itself, and hence needs little introduction. 1 This literature, however, has been complemented but a smaller and growing body of work that discusses centralized monitoring and/or enforcement, in which a specialized agent is responsible for enforcement, as an alternative institution for cooperation.

The purpose is to provide USSOCOM, NSHQ, and the larger counterproliferation (CP) community {{with an understanding of}} how the current network functions, its strengths and weaknesses, and how it can be improved. The research starts by examining prominent theories of international relations to understand cooperation within the network. Afterward, social network analysis (SNA) is used to define the Counter Nuclear SmugglingÐ Europe (CNS-E) network and characterize its structure. Lastly, the function of the network is assessed using realistic vignettes based upon current threats in Europe. The results of this research indicate that the CNS-E network is highly <b>decentralized</b> and dense. <b>Cooperation</b> is abundant, though not sufficiently strong to ensure that information is shared. This research concludes by making the following recommendations: 1) The U.

40|$|Autonomous robotic {{excavation}} {{has often}} been limited to a single robotic platform using a specified excavation vehicle. This paper presents a novel method for developing scalable controllers for use in multirobot scenarios and {{that do not require}} human defined operations scripts nor extensive modeling of the kinematics and dynamics of the excavation vehicles. Furthermore, the control system does not require specifying an excavation vehicle type such as a bulldozer, front-loader or bucket-wheel and it can evolve to select for an appropriate choice of excavation vehicles to successfully complete a task. The Ã Â¿artificial neural tissueÃ Â¿ (ANT) architecture is used as a control system for autonomous multirobot excavation and clearing tasks. This control architecture combines a variable-topology neural-network structure with a coarse-coding strategy that permits specialized areas to develop in the tissue. Training is done in a low-fidelity grid world simulation environment and where a single global fitness function and a set of allowable basis behaviors need be specified. This approach is found to provide improved training performance over fixed-topology neural networks and can be easily ported onto different robot platforms. Aspects of the controller functionality have been tested using high fidelity dynamics simulation and in hardware. An evolutionary training process discovers novel <b>decentralized</b> methods of <b>cooperation</b> employing aggregation behaviors (via synchronized movements). These aggregation behaviors are found to improve controller scalability (with increasing robot density) and better handle robot interference (antagonism) that reduces the overall efficiency of the group...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze policy implementation during the first year of the Information Technology Campus (IT Campus) project in Thailand. The policies for the IT Campus project are intended to expand the reach of traditional academic institutions throughout Thailand. This study applies Mazamanian and Sabatier's (1989) conceptual framework of the policy implementation process to assess qualitatively the first phase of the IT Campus. Elite interviews regarding education technology policy were conducted with 37 respondents, including the minister, the permanent secretary, and various other officials of the Ministry of University Affairs; the deputy director of the National Electronic and Computer Technology Center; seven university presidents; 11 vice presidents; and several college deans, associate deans, and directors of academic computing. Policy that seems impressive in theory often fails during practical application. There is no time when this is more apparent than during the policy implementation stage. This study is therefore guided by two primary research questions. First, how was the IT Campus project policy formulated? Second, to what extent has the policy been successfully manifested during the implementation stage? This study investigates the policy creation process pertaining to information technology campuses in Thailand. It also evaluates the degree of success regarding the three national Thai policies designed to implement the use of information technology within academic institutions. Important issues to be examined include those of ambiguous policy development, specific project outcomes, and the relationships between policymakers and policy implementors. The results of this study show that the effectiveness of policy implementation was hampered by policy ambiguity and led to delays in funding allocation. This situation was further compounded by frequent changes of top governmental policymakers, which in turn led to a breakdown in communication and a lack of cooperation between the Ministry of University Affairs and the participating universities.
