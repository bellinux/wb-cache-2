5|$|After {{the events}} in The Sleeping Dragon, George Stobbart is running a bail bonds office in New York with his partner Virgil. George meets Anna Maria, a girl with an old {{manuscript}} who wants his help to decode it. A group of mobsters after the manuscript ransack Anna Maria's hotel room, as well as George's bail bonds office, and steal the manuscript.

Bian Koen, however, remains suicidal, and intends {{to go to war}} in China to find death; the only thing restraining him is his promise to wait for the anniversary of Lily's death. One day, as he is passing through the village of Cikembang, he finds a well-kept grave. As <b>he</b> <b>examines</b> the area, he sees a woman who he thinks is Lily. She rejects his embrace and runs away. When Bian Koen chases her, he falls and passes out.|$|E
5|$|Otjes's {{approach}} is more empirical {{than that of}} many contributors to Political Animals and Animal Politics. <b>He</b> <b>examines</b> the Dutch Party for the Animals (PvdD), which, in 2006, won two seats in the House of Representatives. Otjes explores whether the PvdD's presence has changed {{the amount of time}} more established parties spent on animal issues by examining both parliamentary speeches and motions before and after the introduction of the PvdD members. He finds that established parties began to talk more about animal issues in 2006, and that this could be attributed to conflict between the PvdD and the established parties. Though Otjes allows that his study's relevance may seem limited, he concludes that smaller parties can affect government agenda by remaining focused on their own primary concern.|$|E

5|$|Doctor Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley) is {{concerned}} that the increasing numbers of tribbles threaten to consume all the food aboard the Enterprise. It is discovered that they are entering ship systems, interfering with their functions, and consuming any edible contents present. Kirk realizes that if the tribbles are getting into the ship's stores, they are {{a threat to the}} grain aboard the station. <b>He</b> <b>examines</b> the holds but learns that it is already too late: The tribbles have indeed eaten the quadrotriticale, and Kirk is literally buried in grain-gorged tribbles when he opens a grain hold with an overhead hatch. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and McCoy discover that about half the tribbles in the hold are dead and many of the rest are dying, alerting them that the grain has been poisoned.|$|E
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>examines</b> {{in detail}} the {{expression}} of evolutionary stages {{in the development of}} embryos, tracing from the process of cell division to the development of specific anatomical features. He finds a striking resemblance between the embryonic development of reptiles and birds, including details of the skeletal anatomy (with special attention to the hands and feet) and various organs. He notes that bird and reptile embryos develop visceral arches, hinting at their aquatic ancestry. Of more interest to his goal, Heilmann writes in a similar vein that the embryos of certain birds clearly show a three-clawed finger structure, at least one of which (the hoatzin) retains actual claws after hatching. He mentions other anatomical features of bird embryos that hint at their reptilian ancestry as well, such as the embryonic splitting of the pygostyle into distinct separate vertebrae.|$|E

Also, Faulkner shares NLP techniques that cultivate discipline, perfect goal-formulating and create a “decisive mind.|$|E
25|$|By using fictional biographies, many {{inspired}} by his own experiences, Kabakov has attempted to explain the birth and death of the Soviet Union, which {{he claims to be}} the first modern society to disappear. In the Soviet Union, Kabakov discovers elements common to every modern society, and in doing so <b>he</b> <b>examines</b> the rift between capitalism and communism. Rather than depict the Soviet Union as a failed Socialist project defeated by Western economics, Kabakov describes it as one utopian project among many, capitalism included. By reexamining historical narratives and perspectives, Kabakov delivers a message that every project, whether public or private, important or trivial, has the potential to fail due to the potentially authoritarian will to power.|$|E
