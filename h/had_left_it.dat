5|$|As dawn came, {{the army}} {{approached}} a stream called Stony Brook. The road the army took followed Stony Brook for a mile farther until it intersected the Post Road from Trenton to Princeton. However, {{off to the}} right of this road, there was an unused road which crossed the farmland of Thomas Clark. The road was not visible from the Post Road, and ran through cleared land to a stretch from which the town could be entered at any point because the British <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>it</b> undefended.|$|E
5|$|Britain's {{successes in}} the Seven Years' War <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>it</b> with {{expensive}} commitments in the Americas {{that had to}} be paid for and had catalysed the formation of an anti-British coalition in Europe. The British Government's attempt to levy new taxes on the Thirteen Colonies of British America led to the outbreak of the American War of Independence in 1776. Spain declared war on Britain and started the Anglo-Spanish War and then tried to recover Gibraltar with French aid.|$|E
5|$|Laura and L. D. {{were due}} to be arraigned on May 25. Between 11:30 and midnight on May 24, a group of between a dozen and 40 men arrived at the jail. They entered it {{through the front door}} of the sheriff's office. Payne, the jailer, said he <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>it</b> {{unlocked}} to let in a detective from McAlester, who was looking for an escaped prisoner. He said the men bound, gagged and blindfolded him at gunpoint, took his keys, and cut the telephone line. He was unable to identify them.|$|E

He had forgotten a hammer and nails to hang the painting, and <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>it</b> {{leaning against the wall}} for an hour. Shortly after he returned, city aldermen, police officers and local reporters arrived at the scene, leading to a dramatic confrontation between aldermen and other students, while Nelson remained incognito nearby.|$|E
5|$|Bamber {{told the}} police that Sheila was {{familiar}} with guns {{and that they had}} gone target shooting together. He said he had been at the farmhouse himself a few hours earlier, and that he had loaded the rifle because he thought he had heard rabbits outside. He <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>it</b> on the kitchen table fully loaded, with a box of ammunition nearby. After the bodies were discovered, a Dr. Craig, was called to the house to certify the deaths, which he testified could have occurred {{at any time during the}} night. He said Bamber appeared to be in a state of shock; Bamber broke down, cried and seemed to vomit. The doctor said Bamber told him about the discussion the family had had about possibly having Sheila's sons placed in foster care.|$|E
5|$|When Locke {{leaves the}} island to bring the {{survivors}} back to the island, Ben tracks him down. He gets Locke to reveal what he knows about returning to the island, then kills him and stages it as a suicide. Ben visits Jack in the funeral home housing Locke's body, telling Jack he will help him return to the island, {{but the only way}} to get back is to bring everyone who <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>it,</b> including Locke's corpse. Ben boards Ajira Airways Flight 316 with the rest of survivors, which then crashes on the island. Jack, Kate, Hurley, and Sayid are transported to 1977, while Sun and Ben remain in 2007 with a resurrected Locke. The plane crash lands on the Hydra Island, so Ben attempts to take a boat to the main island. Sun strikes him in the back of the head and takes the boat with Frank, so Ben is left in the care of the other survivors, including Locke. After Ben regains consciousness and finds Locke to be alive, he convinces Locke he knew bringing him to the island would resurrect him, and he stopped Locke's suicide attempt merely to gain information. Locke travels with Ben, who is to be judged by the Monster. After they fail to find the Monster at the Barracks, they head to the Temple. As Ben and Locke travel through a series of tunnels beneath the Temple, Ben falls through the floor, so Locke leaves to get something that he can pull him up with. The Monster flows out of a grate below and surrounds Ben, showing flashes of decisions he made in his life involving Alex. The Monster takes the form of Alex and pushes Ben against a wall. She says she knows Ben is planning to kill Locke again, and if he does she will hunt him down and destroy him. She orders him to follow Locke and do whatever he asks, then disappears. They return to the Others' camp, where Locke gathers the group together and announces he is taking them to see Jacob. As they are walking, Ben relates his experience with the Monster and his promise to do whatever Locke asks, so Locke convinces Ben to kill Jacob. Richard leads them to the base of the statue, where Jacob lives. Within, they are met by Jacob (Mark Pellegrino). Jacob greets Locke and observes Locke has found a loophole. It is revealed that Locke was not resurrected, and is instead the Monster taking the form of Locke. Ben confronts Jacob about why he never revealed himself at any time during Ben's tenure as leader, but when Jacob is dismissive towards him, he stabs Jacob twice, killing him - and in doing so, binds his destiny to the island, sealing his own fate.|$|E

25|$|Another convincing {{case where}} {{understanding}} of the body was extended beyond where Galen <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>it</b> came from these demonstrations {{of the nature of}} human circulation and the subsequent work of Andrea Cesalpino, Fabricio of Acquapendente and William Harvey. Some Galenic teaching, such as his emphasis on bloodletting as a remedy for many ailments, however, remained influential until well into the 19th century.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} change, however, was his {{reform of the}} calendar. The calendar was then regulated by {{the movement of the}} moon, and this <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>it</b> in a mess. Caesar replaced this calendar with the Egyptian calendar, which was regulated by the sun. He set the length of the year to 365.25 days by adding an intercalary/leap day at the end of February every fourth year.|$|E

25|$|The Redskins had {{the number}} 21 {{painted on the}} field, at a parking lot {{entrance}} and in the Redskins Ring of Fame, all three of which became temporary memorials. In addition to the black No. 21 sticker {{on the back of}} every NFL helmet, the Redskins also wore the number as a patch on player uniforms, warmup shirts and coaching staff jackets, as well as unveiling a banner bearing his name and number. His locker at Redskins Park was encased in Plexiglas and left the same way Taylor <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>it.</b> The organization also established a trust fund for Taylor's daughter, Jackie.|$|E
25|$|The {{promise of}} {{independence}} convinced the insurgents {{to accept the}} proposal. The promise of the supremacy of the Roman Catholic Church was offered to the clergy, who were frightened by anti-clerical policies of Spanish Liberalism. The offer of equality between Criollos and the Spanish-born Peninsulares assured the latter that they and their property would be safe in the new state. This was important because the Peninsulares owned {{a significant part of}} the valuable real estate and many of the businesses in Mexico. If the Spaniards <b>had</b> <b>left,</b> <b>it</b> would have been disastrous for the Mexican economy.|$|E

25|$|During 1944 and 1945 the RAAF's Australian First Tactical Air Force (No. 1 TAF) {{took part}} in the advance of Allied forces along the {{northern}} coast of New Guinea, followed by the invasions of Morotai in the Netherlands East Indies and several locations on or around Borneo. While No. 1 TAF was intended to operate as a highly mobile striking force, by mid-1945 these operations <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>it</b> operating a string of bases outside of the main combat zones. These bases required air garrisons to protect them from remnant Japanese forces, as well as administrative units to maintain a supply chain back to Australia.|$|E
25|$|His {{first win}} was in 1893, in Namur-Dinant-Givet in Belgium. He had sold his first bike {{and bought a}} lighter one — still 16kg but with {{pneumatic}} tyres — for 850 old French francs (approx €3,000 at 2008 values). The race was over 102km. He was leading by Dinant when he punctured. Spotting a soigneur waiting with a spare bike for a rival, Garin rested his own {{against the wall of}} a bridge, grabbed the soigneur's spare bike and rode off. At the finish, winning with ten minutes over the field, he gave back the bike and recovered his own the next day where he <b>had</b> <b>left</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
