40|$|A {{diffusive}} {{solar cell}} window comprises a <b>diffusion</b> <b>plate</b> with TiO 2 nanoparticles sandwiched between two glass layers. It is a simple, inexpensive, easy-to-made, and highly reliable transparent solar energy module. To improve its power generation efficiency {{as well as}} maintain indoor natural lighting, we examined the scattering mechanism in the <b>diffusion</b> <b>plate</b> with TiO 2 nanoparticles within a diffusive solar cell window by Mie scattering simulations. In this work, a multiwavelength ASAP ray tracing model for a diffusive solar cell window with acceptable accuracy was developed to investigate {{the influence of the}} <b>diffusion</b> <b>plate</b> design parameter, mainly concentration of a <b>diffusion</b> <b>plate</b> with determined particle size distribution, on power generation efficiency and color shift of transmitted sun light. A concept of “effective average radius” was proposed to account for the equivalent scattering effect of a size distribution of quasispherical particles. Simulation results demonstrated that both the transmitted light and its correlated color temperature decreased as the concentration increased for a large-size diffusive solar cell window. However, there existed a maximum power generation efficiency at around 160 [*]ppm concentration. The optimal design for a large-size <b>diffusion</b> <b>plate</b> inside a diffusive solar cell window by taking indoor lighting into account was suggested based on the simulation results...|$|E
40|$|Proteolytic {{activity}} was detected, using a sensitive radial <b>diffusion</b> <b>plate</b> assay, in the plasma membrane fractions of corn (Zea mays L.) roots and from roots {{of several other}} plant species. The proteases could be effectively inhibited in corn with phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride or chymostatin. Protease activity of oat roots, however, was not significantly reduced by these inhibitors. The results of <b>diffusion</b> <b>plate</b> assay were confirmed with the less sensitive azocasein assay using crude cell homogenates. Chymostatin and phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride were effective in preventing protease degradation of polypeptides as revealed by electrophoresis. The <b>diffusion</b> <b>plate</b> assay uses a permanent support for a 0. 75 millimeter thick agarose slab containing 200 micrograms per milliliter casein. By staining the fixed and dried gel with Coomassie blue R- 250, proteolytic {{activity was}} visualized as a cleared area around the sample well with a detection limit of about 0. 3 nanograms trypsin.

30|$|Table  2 {{shows the}} fungal {{activity}} of the fifteen isolates determined by gel <b>diffusion</b> <b>plate</b> assays. The zone of diffusion was largest for A. fumigatus JCM 10253 (4  mg/mL; 1.5  cm) followed by F. africana and Fomitopsis sp. (2  mg/mL; 1.4  cm), P. pulmonarius (1.1  cm), A. ochraceus (1.0  cm), E. rubrum (0.6  cm), and A. caespitosus (0.5  cm). These results indicate that these fungi exhibit β-glucosidase activity and esculin hydrolysis. In contrast, no zone of diffusion was visible when A. nomius, Aspergillus sp., or F. verticillioides were inoculated on esculin gel. The absence of a black zone clearly indicates that these fungal strains {{do not have the}} ability to hydrolyze esculin. It has been previously reported that the diameter of the diffusion zone in a gel diffusion assay is proportional to the enzyme concentration (Wood et al. 1988; Saqib and Whitney 2006). Therefore, a standard curve of β-glucosidase was prepared on esculin gel to confirm this correlation.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: Examination of the {{antibiotic}} powers towards bacteria and moulds of 150 strains of yeasts from the British National Collection of Yeast Cultures {{has revealed that}} whereas none exhibited marked antibacterial properties certain of them inhibited the growth of moulds. Strains of Cundida pulcherrima, when grown on a malt+yeast+peptone+glucose agar medium inhibited the growth of strains of certain MUCOT, Pusarium and Penicillium spp. “he inhibition was due to pulcherriminic acid, a derivative of the red pigment, pulcherrimin, formed by Candidu pulchemvima.

30|$|A three step {{approach}} {{was employed to}} unravel {{the nature of the}} substantial antimicrobial agent produced by P. aeruginosa strain EGYII DSM 101801.

In addition, the antimicrobial agent was not adversely affected by incubation with proteinase K for 30  min at 55  °C. This in turn indicated the non-proteinous (most probably non-bacteriocin) nature of the antimicrobial agent of quest. Secondly, no zone of inhibition was detected in well-cut diffusion assay of E. amylovora strain EGY 1 DSM 101800 containing 100  µM FeCl 3; however, agar <b>diffusion</b> <b>plates</b> prepared without FeCl 3 showed perceivable zones of inhibition around the wells containing the antimicrobial agent of quest.

These correspond to T 1 and T 2 described by Burnett. Both tyrosinases have similar enzyme characteristics, but differ in their isoelectric points. Antiserum was prepared against tyrosinase T 1 from melanosomes. This antiserum cross-reacted with both T 1 and T 2 tyrosinases of the microsomal and soluble fractions in double <b>diffusion</b> <b>plates</b> and immunoelectrophoresis.

40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with bending plate theory for thermoelastic diffusion materials under Green-Naghdi theory. First, we present the basic equations which characterize the bending of thin thermoelastic <b>diffusion</b> <b>plates</b> for type II and III models. The theory allows for the effect of transverse shear deformation without any shear correction factor, and permits the propagation of waves at a finite speed without energy dissipation for type II model and with energy dissipation for type III model. By the semigroup theory of linear operators, we prove the well-posedness of the both models and the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of type III model. For unbounded plate of type III model, we prove that a measure associated with the thermodynamic process decays faster than an exponential of a polynomial of second degree. Finally, we investigate the impossibility of the localization in time of solutions. The main idea to prove this result is to show the uniqueness of solutions for the backward in-time problem...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the {{experiments}} reported in this paper was to gain information on the molecular origin of the mitotic apparatus. Antisera were prepared against unfertilized sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) egg antigens and mitotic apparatus antigens.

The results revealed that the mitotic apparatus contains probably no more than two antigens (precursor- 1 component and precursor- 2 component) and that these are shared by the unfertilized egg. Absorption and fractionation techniques indicated that in the unfertilized egg the precursor- 1 component is present both as a "soluble" protein and as an insoluble form tenaciously associated with intracellular structural elements. A survey of dividing and non-dividing tissues for the precursor- 1 component revealed that it was restricted to tissues in which mitotic activity could be detected microscopically.

Analysis of cell surface glycoproteins by the periodate-[3 H]borohydride labeling technique combined with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) -fluorography demonstrated that fibronectin and some other high-molecular-weight cell surface glycoproteins were degraded by a 35, 000 -Mr(35 K) B. gingivalis protease. Immunostaining of the fibroblast cultures showed degradation of intercellular matrix fibronectin by the 35 K protease. The pattern of fibronectin degradation was monitored by examining the reaction products with the SDS-PAGE-immunoblotting technique. The protease degraded fibronectin rapidly and more extensively than did corresponding amounts of pancreatic trypsin. Collagenase secretion by the fibroblasts was assayed by incubating cell culture medium with soluble type I [3 H]collagen at 25 degrees C followed by SDS-PAGE-fluorography analysis of the reaction products. The medium was also assayed for plasminogen activator activity by using a casein-agarose <b>diffusion</b> <b>plate</b> assay. The fibroblasts cultured with the 35 K protease secreted increased amounts of collagenase and plasminogen activator into the medium.

40|$|Abstract: The {{current study}} was {{designed}} to obtain an information on the immune factors which could be underlying the induction of protective immunity to the genus Fasciola in rats, using immunosuppressive drugs and diffusion chamber technique. The rats became resistant to challenge with the Japanese species of Fasciola following an oral infection with metacercariae, indicating a significant degree of reduced worm burdens. This protective effect in the immunized rats, however, was abrogated by the administration of immunosuppressants, dexamethasone and prednisolone. In rats treated with these drugs, no antigen-antibody band in immunodiffusion plate was recognized throughout the infection, while many bands were observed in sera from the rats without treatment with the drugs. From the results obtained, the antigen-antibody bands in <b>diffusion</b> <b>plate</b> would be a good indicator to estimate the degree of protective immunity to the genus Fasciola in host animals. By intraperitoneally implanting the immature worms in diffusion chamber, the rats were able to induce a significantly high degree of protective immunity when compared to the natural-immunity control. However, the degree of protective effect was significantly high in rats which received free worm (without chamber) implan-tation. In the experimental rats, each fraction of their serum proteins was also examined by performing cellulose acetate electrophoresis. More detailed examination is required to investigate the immune factors in the protective immunity to the fluke in rats, using immunosuppressive drugs and/or diffusion chamber techniques in terms of host-parasite relationship...|$|E

Toxin B is associated with the soluble or cytoplasmic fraction of the cell. This evidence suggested that each toxin represented a distinctly different molecular species.
