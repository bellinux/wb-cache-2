5|$|The {{campaign}} {{plays out}} through 26 missions, with story scenes that tie the plot together occurring between {{and during the}} battles. In addition, 38 training missions are unlocked as the missions are completed. The training missions are more challenging, entirely optional, and can be played separately from the campaign. One new feature in Days of Ruin is that campaign missions can now be played individually as the player completes them. Like the training missions, campaign missions can be selected <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>menu</b> at any time.|$|E
5|$|After {{the player}} completes {{the game with}} either the bad ending or the best ending, Julius Mode is unlocked, similar to the Julius Mode in Aria of Sorrow. Julius Mode, in storyline terms, follows the {{assumption}} that Soma succumbed to his dark power, and became the new dark lord. A new game can then be started <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>menu</b> in Julius Mode. In Julius Mode, the playable characters include Julius Belmont, Yoko Belnades, and Alucard. Each character has a weapon {{and an assortment of}} abilities unique to them, and although these abilities remain static throughout the entire game, the characters' statistics can improve by acquiring enough experience points to level up. The castle layout and enemies are the same, {{with the exception of the}} final battle, which is against Soma.|$|E
5|$|Gummi Ships {{are another}} common {{element of the}} series, which serve as the main mode of {{transportation}} between worlds in the games. The gameplay for the Gummi Ship sections is more akin to a rail shooter. Because it received negative criticism in the first game, it was modified in the third title. Most games also feature a journal which is accessible <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>menu.</b> This journal keeps track of information regarding the story, characters, enemies, and locations. In the first three games, the journal is kept by Jiminy Cricket, who was appointed by Queen Minnie as the royal chronicler. In 358/2 Days, Birth by Sleep and Dream Drop Distance, the main characters write their own journal entries.|$|E

500|$|The {{player can}} unlock sixteen minigames by earning points and {{completing}} activities. The minigames are divided equally between the tables for Ariel and Melody. They {{are based on}} scenes from the films: in one minigame, the player whacks frogs and fish during the [...] "Kiss the Girl" [...] sequence, while the player helps Melody escape from a frozen block of ice in another. If the player successfully finishes a minigame, it becomes accessible for replay <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>menu.</b> Frank Provo of GameSpot identified the minigames as the [...] "underlying premise" [...] of the overall game.|$|E

The player moves the remote in a similar manner to how the separate games are played in real life; for example, holding and swinging the Wii Remote like a golf club, baseball bat or bowling ball. Some aspects of the gameplay are computer controlled. In tennis, player movement is controlled by the Wii, while the swinging of the racket is controlled by the player. Baseball {{consists of}} batting and pitching, with all of the fielding and baserunning handled by the Wii.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{traditional}} visual {{novels that}} consist of static characters with subtitled dialogue, School Days {{is unusual in}} that it incorporates motion and voice, making it reminiscent of an animated series. Cinematics naturally play on their own, and players are afforded the ability to pause, fast-forward, and even skip those they've seen before. Male and female voices can be muted, subtitles can be turned on or off and the game can be played from a window or fullscreen ratio. Progress can be saved {{at any time in}} up to 100 slots and loaded <b>from</b> either <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>menu</b> or during play.|$|R
500|$|Initiating a {{conversation}} or investigating {{an object in}} the main game will often lead to the player being asked to solve a puzzle. If the plot progresses to {{a point at which}} a puzzle can no longer be accessed, it will be retrieved by a character named Keats the Cat for later solving. [...] There are over 170 puzzles in the game, including brain teasers, sliding puzzles, logic puzzles, peg solitaire, and several other varieties. When a puzzle begins, the player is briefly presented with the puzzle's name, number, and value in [...] "Picarats", the game's system of points as well as an estimation of the puzzle's difficulty. These points are not used during the main game, but if a player collects enough of these Picarats, they gain access to bonuses accessible <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>menu.</b>|$|E
500|$|Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater - HD Edition was {{released}} for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles in late 2011. It {{was released}} {{as part of}} the Metal Gear Solid HD Collection, as well as a digital download on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade. The PS3 and Xbox 360 versions run in a resolution of 720p and aim for a target framerate of 60 frames per second, compared to the PS2 version's maximum of 30 FPS. The aspect ratio has also been increased from the original's [...] presentation to a wider [...] resolution, giving players a wider view of their surroundings. The HD Edition features some of the content from the Subsistence version, such as the third-person camera and demo theater, but lacks the online multiplayer mode and the [...] "Snake vs. Monkey" [...] minigame (due to this version also being released on the Xbox 360). The two MSX2 Metal Gear games are also included in this version, both accessible <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>menu.</b> A PlayStation Vita version of the Metal Gear Solid HD Collection on June 2012, which features Metal Gear Solid 2 and 3; this version of Metal Gear Solid 3 features limited touch controls {{to take advantage of the}} Vita's touch screen, and compared to the PS2 version, the framerate is a more consistent 30 FPS, with less screen tearing.|$|E
500|$|To {{solve the}} issues of {{transferring}} information from the original game's engine to the Saber engine, the developers looked at how they used the third-party Havok physics engine to handle object positioning, velocities, and collisions. Saber created a proxy of every object in the Halo engine to transfer into the Saber engine, meaning that the game's original programming remained unchanged. [...] The game's ability to alternate between the legacy and remastered graphics engines in the campaign {{was made possible by}} the rendering engine developed by Saber Interactive. The technology allowed the developers to update Halo: Combat Evolveds visuals and preserve the original gameplay. Originally, players would have chosen which graphical presentation to play <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>menu.</b> The in-game toggle feature quickly became a talking point among the developers, who pushed for it to be available to other players. Since the ability to switch between classic version and remastered version was provided to players, both engines work simultaneously to retain the spontaneity of game. This approach caused several problems, including collision issues—because objects and environments in the original game were of a lower resolution with fewer polygons, higher-resolution visuals in the Saber engine could deviate from the original significantly. As the original game's geometry was used as the basis for collisions, in some cases characters could appear to walk through or above terrain, weapons could drop through the ground, and bullets would appear to be deflected by nothing. The sheer number of these issues, combined with the desire to keep the original gameplay intact, forced Saber to use a variety of approaches to fix the problems, including making tools for artists to visualize height differences and creating intermediate geometry. In some cases, the artists developed other ways of keeping to the same collision data while updating the visuals by changing the actual object—turning a blocky, low-polygon rock into an angular Forerunner structure avoided the collision issues.|$|E
5000|$|The game {{functions}} as a visual novel-style [...] "additional episode". While this game features official art, backgrounds and music {{in the style of}} the original series and full-voice, it is fundamentally different <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first Girlfriend of Steel. The artwork was done by a new team, but the voices were provided by the same voice actors <b>from</b> <b>the</b> original series cast. The game also has dating sim elements and includes three [...] "dateable" [...] characters (Rei, Asuka, and Kaworu). Reward CG for each character can be uncovered and collected in a CG gallery accessible <b>from</b> <b>the</b> game's <b>main</b> <b>menu.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The {{individual}} {{stages of}} each Manhunt installment are typically {{referred to in}} a way that relates to the game's plot. In the first game, stages are called [...] "scenes," [...] which relates to the snuff film in which the protagonist is forced to participate. In the second game, stages are called [...] "episodes," [...] relating to the mental state and experiences of the protagonist, an escaped mental patient. In this vein, the gameplay itself in Manhunt 2 is referred to as [...] "treatment" [...] (for example, instead of a [...] "Load Game" [...] option <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>menu,</b> the option is [...] "Continue Treatment"). Players survive the stages by dispatching enemies occasionally with firearms, but primarily by stealthly executing them, often in bloody over-the-top ways. In order to carry out executions, the player must approach an enemy from behind, undetected. To facilitate this, each stage in both games are full of [...] "dark spots" [...] (shadows where the player can hide). Enemies cannot see into the shadows (unless they see the player actually entering the area). A standard technique in both games is to hide in the shadows and tap a wall {{to attract the attention of}} a nearby enemy. When he has examined the area and is moving away, the player can emerge from the shadows behind him, and execute him.|$|E

5000|$|When {{the console}} {{is used for}} the first time, an adult is {{required}} to set up the user for the console. This includes the user's name, and difficulty level. Upon completion, the child is allowed to log in for the first time, in which Tad and Dot (two Leapfrog characters) will give the child a present- the puppy, Scout. Apparently the user is to babysit Scout while Tad and Dot are away. Subsequent log-ins will start with Tad and Dot coming on-screen and calling Scout into view before leaving. <b>From</b> here, <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>menu</b> appears and <b>the</b> user is given access to four built-in games, the cartridge game if its present, and Scout's dog house, in which the user can go to explore and play.

5|$|Undead Nightmare is a {{modified}} {{expansion of the}} 2010 video game Red Dead Redemption, an open world Western action-adventure in which the former outlaw John Marston is coerced {{by the federal government}} to capture former members of his gang in exchange for his family's freedom. Undead Nightmare is an alternate timeline expansion that adds a new full-length story in a zombie horror theme and reworks the base game's environment to appear dark and spooky. As corpses begin to rise <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dead to become flesh-eating zombies, some of the living go into hiding and others become hostile. Marston seeks to find the plague's cause and its cure for his wife and son. The game's story lasts about six hours and includes new cutscenes, voice acting, and music. It is accessed separately <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> game <b>menu</b> with its own save files. It does not share play progress and items <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> game, nor does it require the base game in any form.|$|R
500|$|Before playing, a {{difficulty}} {{has to be}} selected: easy, medium, hard or expert. Expert is a match of the original notes; hard has some note-heavy drum rolls and other difficult or fast notes removed; medium takes away the orange notes (for guitar and bass) and anything else considered tricky. Easy is designed for new players, and gives an easy rhythm for those to settle into the game. However, there are too few notes for it to feel like they're playing <b>the</b> actual tune <b>from</b> <b>the</b> song. A [...] "No Fail" [...] mode has been carried over from Rock Band 2 and is accessible <b>from</b> <b>the</b> band members selection screen rather than <b>from</b> <b>the</b> game's <b>main</b> <b>menu.</b> This mode allows players to continue to play, even if their performance metre hits the bottom.

Some are more adept at detecting the player's scent, while others may {{see him in the}} distance, or hear his footsteps. Once a dinosaur takes note of the player, a number of reactions can happen. Herbivores may run away or attack the player if they feel cornered. Carnivores may attack the player head on, or gather in an organized pack to flank the player and take him out. Regardless of which dinosaur the player is hunting, there are others that do not appear on the radar that can launch a surprise attack. Harmless, ambient animals such as appear on every hunt but cannot be selected <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> hunting <b>menu.</b> These are the Moschops, Gallimimus, Dimetrodon, Dimorphodon, Pteranodon, and Brachiosaurus.

5|$|In between Novel {{sections}} are Escape sections, which {{occur when}} the player finds themselves in a room from which they need to find the means of escape. These are presented from a first-person perspective, with the player being able to move between different pre-determined positions in each room. To escape, the player is tasked with finding various items and solving puzzles, reminiscent of escape-the-room games. At some points, the player may need to combine objects {{with each other to}} create the necessary tool to complete a puzzle. The puzzles include various brain teasers, such as baccarat and magic squares. An in-game calculator is provided for math-related problems, and the player can ask characters for hints if they find an Escape room too difficult. All Escape sections are self-contained, with all items required to solve the puzzles being available within that section; items are not carried over between Escape sections. After finishing an Escape section, it becomes available to replay <b>from</b> <b>the</b> game's <b>main</b> <b>menu.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In Jaws: Unleashed, {{the player}} assumes {{the role of}} the shark, Jaws. The shark first enters <b>the</b> island <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{southern}} end and the player finds itself in a cove. The cove has tutorials to allow the player to become familiar with the controls, such as the ones for moving the shark and attacking other creatures. The shark has a menu for upgrades as well. These can be accessed <b>from</b> either <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>menu</b> or <b>the</b> pause menu. Upgrade points are earned by causing destruction around Amity Island (in levels and in free-roam mode), completing levels, and/or collecting bonus items, the most frequently found of which being treasure chests. There are numerous upgrade criteria to choose from. Players can choose to upgrade the shark's power, speed, hunger, health, or accuracy. During gameplay, there is a HUD in the lower-right corner of the screen. This HUD has four meters and a sonar that informs players of the positions of important objects, prey, and enemies. The two parallel meters above the sonar are for Jaws' health (right side, red-colored), and hunger (left side, green-colored). As Jaws becomes hungry, its health will diminish, forcing the player to [...] "eat" [...] constantly. The health bar will also diminish as Jaws takes damage. The last two meters are used to charge the shark's tail-whip and head-butt attacks. The more each meter fills, the stronger the attack is. The meters are on the left quadrant of the sonar, running along the arc with the head-butt meter on the outside and the tail-whip meter on the inside. The head-butt meter is orange when charging, flashing when fully charged, and is the same with the tail-whip meter, but it is purple instead of orange. Jaws has unique attacks in its arsenal. The shark can ram objects with its snout, whip others with its caudal tail, bite, and when the player earns enough points to upgrade Jaws' abilities, new attacks become unlocked, such as the [...] "corkscrew" [...] and the [...] "body bomb." [...] To perform a corkscrew attack, charge up the head-butt meter and tail-whip meter; head-butt first, then release the tail-whip button and the shark will spin around, causing damage to anything caught in its wake. To perform a body-bomb, simply charge the head-butt meter, point the shark upward, release movement button and the shark will fly up in the air, and smash back down.|$|R
