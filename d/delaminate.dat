40|$|The {{problem of}} free {{vibration}} of <b>delaminated</b> composite beams is revisited {{in this paper}} by showing the existence of parametric excitation, bifurcation and stability. Why and when the <b>delaminated</b> part buckles during the vibration? To answer this question, first a finite element model is developed for the uncracked beam portion using the theory of layered beams and the so-called system of exact kinematic conditions. Second, a transition element is developed to establish the kinematic connection and continuity among the <b>delaminated</b> and uncracked portions. Thirdly, the <b>delaminated</b> beam portions are modeled by simple layered beam elements. The coupling between the flexural and longitudinal vibration is taken into consideration in the <b>delaminated</b> part and therefore it is shown that this part is loaded by periodic normal forces during the free vibration of the system. The time dependent stiffness because of the normal forces does not influence the frequencies globally at all, however, locally delamination buckling can take place, as well. The bifurcation and stability of the <b>delaminated</b> parts are analyzed using the harmonic balance method and the critical forces in <b>delaminated</b> layered beams under dynamic stability are determined. The free vibration mode shapes {{in the state of}} instability are predicted based on the critical dynamic force and the condition of constant arc length of the <b>delaminated</b> parts. Finally the phase plane portraits of the motion of the midpoint in the <b>delaminated</b> region are presented giving a global view on the behavior of composite beams under harmonic vibration...|$|R
40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{represents a}} {{comparative study of}} Lewis acid catalysis using heteroatom-substituted <b>delaminated</b> zeolites, which are synthesized using an approach that obviates the need for surfactants and sonication during exfoliation. The comparison involves heteroatom substitution into silanol nests of <b>delaminated</b> zeolites consisting of DZ- 1 and deboronated UCB- 4. Diffuse reflectance ultraviolet (DR-UV) spectroscopy demonstrates framework heteroatom sites, and the Lewis acidity of these sites is confirmed using infrared spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine. The enhanced catalytic accessibility of these Lewis acid sites is confirmed when performing Baeyer–Villiger oxidation of substituted 2 -adamantanones with hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant. Comparison of <b>delaminated</b> Sn-DZ- 1 with three-dimensional Sn-Beta for this reaction shows that the <b>delaminated</b> zeolite is more active for bulkier ketone substrates. The role of the two-dimensional crystalline framework of the <b>delaminated</b> zeolite on catalysis is highlighted by comparing <b>delaminated</b> zeolites Sn-DZ- 1 with Sn-UCB- 4. The former exhibits a significantly higher activity for Baeyer–Villiger oxidation, yet when comparing Ti-DZ- 1 with Ti-UCB- 4, it is the latter that exhibits a significantly higher activity for olefin epoxidation with organic hydrogen peroxide, whereas both <b>delaminated</b> zeolites are more robust and selective in epoxidation catalysis compared with amorphous Ti/SiO_ 2...|$|R

The <b>delaminated</b> beam is analyzed as seven Euler–Bernoulli beams connected at the delamination boundaries. The continuity and equilibrium conditions are satisfied between the adjoining regions of the beams. Lower and upper bounds of the natural frequencies of the <b>delaminated</b> beams are identified by assuming totally ‘free’ and totally ‘constrained’ deformations of the <b>delaminated</b> layers, respectively. These solutions can serve as generalized solutions for vibration and buckling of <b>delaminated</b> composites. The relation between the square of the natural frequency of the <b>delaminated</b> beam and the axial compressive load is also investigated. Results show a linear relation between the square of the “constrained mode” and “free mode” frequencies of the simply supported beam and the axial compressive load. A non-linear relation is observed between the square of the “free mode” frequencies of a clamped–clamped beam and axial compressive load due to the opening of the <b>delaminated</b> layers in the “free mode” mode shape of the beam...|$|R

The continuity and equilibrium conditions are satisfied between the adjoining regions of the beams.

2500|$|Cast iron used in rails proved {{unsatisfactory}} {{because it}} was brittle and broke under heavy loads. The wrought iron invented by John Birkinshaw in 1820 replaced cast iron. Wrought iron (usually simply referred to as [...] "iron") was a ductile material that could undergo considerable deformation before breaking, making it more suitable for iron rails. But iron was expensive to produce until Henry Cort patented the puddling process in 1784. In 1783 Cort also patented the rolling process, which was 15 times faster at consolidating and shaping iron than hammering. These processes greatly lowered the cost of producing iron and rails. The next important development in iron production was hot blast developed by James Beaumont Neilson (patented 1828), which considerably reduced the amount of coke (fuel) or charcoal needed to produce pig iron. Wrought iron was a soft material that contained included slag or dross. The softness and dross tended to make iron rails distort and <b>delaminate</b> and they lasted less than 10 years. Sometimes they lasted as little as one year under high traffic. All these developments {{in the production of}} iron eventually led to replacement of composite wood/iron rails with superior all iron rails.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the dynamic}} {{instability}} of variable angle tow (VAT) plates {{with a single}} rectangular delamination is studied using an analytical model. The analytical model {{is derived from the}} principle of potential energy based on the classical laminated plate theory. Both global and local behavior of <b>delaminated</b> VAT plates in the dynamic instability analysis are accurately captured by the use of multiple Legendre polynomial series. The equations for the motion in dynamic instability problem are derived using Hamilton’s principle. The dynamic instability regions are determined from the resulting Mathieu differential equations, which are solved using Bolotin’s approach. To validate the proposed analytical model, both critical buckling loads and natural frequencies of <b>delaminated</b> VAT plates are evaluated and compared with FEM results. The influence of delamination on the buckling load, natural frequency and dynamic instability region (DIR) of <b>delaminated</b> VAT plates is examined by numerical examples.
