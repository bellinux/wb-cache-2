The embossing process was studied in a combination of simulations and experiments. Firstly, the viscoelastic model of PLGA was built after testing the material properties. Secondly, the <b>hot</b> <b>embossing</b> process was simulated by ABAQUS finite element software. The deformation rules of PLGA during <b>hot</b> <b>embossing</b> were then achieved. The pressures inside the PLGA materials were different at various places during <b>hot</b> <b>embossing,</b> which lead to the differences of the filling speeds. As a result, the inner structures were easier to get formed than the outer structures. And the fluidity of PGLA would increase with the raising temperature, which however caused serious material overflow. Finally the <b>hot</b> <b>embossing</b> experiments were presented to verify the simulation results. Agreed with the filling rules of the simulation, enough duration was necessary to let the outer corners of the microstructures be formed completely. Moreover the trapped air in the grooves was compressed into small bubbles at the corners.

40|$|In the {{manufacturing}} of polymeric microfluidic devices, micro-molds {{play a key}} role because they determine not only {{the manufacturing}} cost but also the quality of the molded parts. Recently, a high-quality aluminum alloy 6061 (AA 6061) mold with fine features less than its grain size has been fabricated economically by a <b>hot</b> <b>embossing</b> technique. However, temperature cycling during <b>hot</b> <b>embossing</b> process in mold manufacturing reduces significantly the original tensile strength and hardness of the AA 6061 -T 6 alloy substrate, which is not desirable. In this study, a tempering process is carried out to recover the tensile strength and hardness of the embossed mold. To evaluate the changes of these properties, surface roughness, tensile strength, and hardness values were measured in each stage: (1) before <b>hot</b> <b>embossing,</b> (2) after <b>hot</b> <b>embossing,</b> and (3) tempering to T 4 and tempering to T 6.

Moreover, accelerated testing was carried out to evaluate the changes in hardness and roughness of AA 6061 -T 4 and T 6 molds under the typical <b>hot</b> <b>embossing</b> temperature cycles of manufacturing polymeric devices.

Prepared Ni-stamps were employed in <b>hot</b> <b>embossing</b> of polycarbonate (PC) and cyclo-olefin polymer (COP) films, using a nano-imprinting process. The replication quality of the self-organized wrinkle structures in PC and COP films was monitored by comparing {{the shape and dimensions}} of the original and final surface structures. The <b>hot</b> <b>embossed</b> sub-micron scale features, originally formed on stainless steel substrate, were found to have influence on the optical properties of the PC and COP films by lowering their reflectances...|$|R
