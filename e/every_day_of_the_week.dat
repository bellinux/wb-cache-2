5|$|There {{has been}} a clock on the tower since the early 1700s. There is a peal of eight bells in the tower. Tenor 28cwt (3,136lb/1,422kg) in C. The {{original}} five bells were re-cast by the celebrated Thomas Bilbie of Chew Stoke in 1735 to make a peal of six, and in 1898 four of these were re-cast and two were repaired by Messrs. Mears and Stainbank of London to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. Two additional bells, the gift of Brigadier Ommanney, were added in 1928 to complete the octave, which still contains two of the Bilbie bells. The present clock, installed in 1903, plays a verse of a hymn every four hours, at 8am, noon, 4 and 8pm, with a different hymn tune for <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>week.</b> The church is a Grade I listed building.|$|E

25|$|Rosewater {{was also}} {{the site of the}} AdelaideRadio (VIA) {{maritime}} radio station system, the sixth built in Australia and one of 19 around the country. Opened 1 October 1912 it operated from 8am to midnight <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>week,</b> {{and was one of the}} first points of contact for ships sailing south from Hong Kong and Japan. Apart from its major function of listening for ships' messages, Adelaide also handled traffic to and from the State telegraph system, and broadcast time signals to shipping. By 1963 the rapid industrialisation of the Rosewater area had increased electrical interference to the point where a move to a new site became necessary and the operation was moved to McLaren Vale where it operated until 1993 when it was shut down.|$|E

25|$|Reading Terminal Market (pronounced RED-ing /ˈrɛdɪŋ/) is an {{enclosed}} public market located at 12th and Arch Streets in Center City Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It opened originally in 1893 under the elevated train shed of the Reading Railroad Company {{after the city}} of Philadelphia advocated to move public markets from the streets into indoor facilities for both safety and sanitary reasons.The Reading Railroad Company owned and operated the market space until 1976 when the company liquidated, leaving the market without its parent company and foot traffic from the train. Presently, it still occupies the ground floor and basement levels of the Reading Terminal's former train shed which {{is now part of}} the Philadelphia Convention Center. Vendor stalls occupy the ground floor with entrances on Filbert Street to the South, Twelfth Street to the West, and Arch Street to the North. The stalls are arranged in a grid pattern with an open area in the center with tables and seating. Over one hundred merchants offer fresh produce, meats, fish, artisan cheese, groceries, ice cream, flowers, grilled cheese, baked goods, crafts, books, clothing, and specialty and ethnic foods. Two of the vendors are descendants of original merchants from the initial opening in the late 1800s. The basement floor of the market holds the state-of-the-art refrigerated storage area for vendor use. Currently, the market is open <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>week</b> although the Pennsylvania Dutch merchants (a small but significant minority) generally do not operate Sunday through Tuesday.|$|E

500|$|While the {{sculpture}} was {{a work in}} progress, {{the location of the}} sculptor's rented studio was kept secret from the public, while the husband-and-wife sculptor team and three assistants spent four months working for sixteen hours <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>week.</b> The process involved two sittings with Jordan for measurements and photos, including one in which the clay version had to be driven from Chicago to Nashville, to ensure the accuracy of the clay likeness. The [...] sculpture, which is [...] tall, rests on a 5-foot high black granite base that has an inscription reading [...] "The best there ever was. The best there ever will be." [...] The base also includes a list of his accomplishments. The bronze statue used lost-wax casting. The sculpture has led to a lot of similar work for the couple.|$|E
500|$|Set in {{the year}} 2099, the series depicts the Earth as very {{different}} from today. Following a number of environmental disasters, such as [...] "the Withering" [...] {{which resulted in the}} loss of a great deal of human knowledge including the vacuum cleaner and fire (although the latter came back fairly quickly) [...] and a [...] "Cattle-clasm" [...] that killed off most of the livestock, the Earth has been reduced to a wasteland separated between [...] "Withered Zones" [...] and the remaining inhabitable areas. The Withering shifted the Earth into a new orbit, resulting in disruption to the seasons and a reformed calendar. <b>Every</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>week</b> is now 25-hours long except for Thursday (which, due to time anomalies, has not occurred in over a decade), while the change in the length of the year {{led to the creation of}} new months such as Janril, Febtober, and Marchuary. In addition, the dreary season of Hamble was created, which is permanently dark, cold and drizzly. The Withering resulted in vegetarians, pigeons and gays becoming endangered species, and completely wiped out tarts.|$|E
500|$|An {{important}} part of the game is the accumulation of items, especially rare ones, which allow players to create powerful weapons, armour and food. There are many ways to obtain items, such as harvesting, excavating, logging, mining, defeating monsters, and digging by using Chocobos. Square Enix attempted to increase the opportunity for players to find rare items in order to equalize the game and stop the practice of [...] "gil selling", or exchanging real money for in-game items. The item auction system was shut down temporarily once due to some players exploiting the system. Items can be created by consuming elemental crystals (obtained by fighting monsters) with other ingredients in a process called [...] "synthesis". Recipe results can vary widely based on the player's skill, the quality of the player's equipment worn, and the ingredients used. There is large speculation (though nothing evidently documented yet) about the moon phase, direction the player is facing, in-game day (<b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>week</b> is assigned an element), and even time of day the synthesis is performed to either increase or reduce the results of the recipe.|$|E
