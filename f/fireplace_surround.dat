The {{ceilings}} are lath and plaster, and all rooms have plaster cornices, with the widths and designs varying in different rooms. Principal rooms have ornate central plaster ceiling roses, with the dining room containing two roses which would have been positioned above a central table. Throughout the building, the skirtings, architraves, doors and floor boards are cedar. Doors are panelled with etched, arched glass fanlights, and evidence of early decoration include brackets for curtain rods.The drawing room originally had a white marble <b>fireplace</b> <b>surround</b> with relief carving of fruit, and the dining room had a black marble <b>fireplace</b> <b>surround,</b> both of which have been removed.

The adjacent ante-room housed a bathroom, and surviving evidence include vertically jointed timber panelling and a cedar surround for a shower rose. The bathroom originally housed a slate bath and flushing toilet. The northern bedroom has a vertically jointed timber partition wall which divides the room in two but which does not reach the ceiling height.

50|$|A 1994 {{field survey}} {{conducted}} by Austral Archaeology identified 50 archaeological elements visible {{on the surface of}} Lytton Hill, and all located above the 20 metre contour line. The bulk of these remain, but the former Post and Telegraph Office was vandalised in 1994, resulting in loss of interior casement windows, doors, light fittings and <b>fireplace</b> <b>surrounds</b> and grates.|$|R
50|$|Inside, {{the main}} {{entrance}} leads into the eastern of the two rooms on the first story. It has an enclosed staircase in the southeast corner, and a <b>fireplace</b> <b>surrounded</b> by raised wooden panelling.

The northeast bedroom retains the upper portion of a partition wall which originally separated a former adjacent bathroom which contained a sunken bath. A recently constructed bathroom is located adjacent in {{the northeast corner of}} the enclosed verandah.|$|E
50|$|The {{farmhouse}} is {{a modest}} 1-1/2 story timber frame structure, five bays wide, {{with a side}} gable roof, central chimney, clapboard siding, and a rubble stone foundation that also includes some bedrock. A single-story ell extends {{to the rear of}} the right corner, and a shed-roof dormer extends across much of the back.

Original features appear to include wide pine floors and a Federal period <b>fireplace</b> <b>surround.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{floors are}} timber and joinery {{throughout}} is of cedar with deep skirtings, wide architraves and sills, panelled doors, <b>fireplace</b> <b>surrounds,</b> French doors and casement windows. The water closet contains an early flushing cistern, and gas piping {{for the light}} fittings. The present kitchen has pressed metal sheets to the walls with wall mounted gas light fittings.|$|R
50|$|Wall {{construction}} was the finest quality sandstock bricks {{of a red}} and blue mottle and laid in lime mortar. The exterior walls were stuccoed and lined to imitate. The principal rooms contain fine stone chimney pieces while the south - west rooms have Edwardian <b>fireplace</b> <b>surrounds.</b> All of the fireplaces had been fully tiled circa 1911, these fireplaces have been restored.|$|R
50|$|Both {{interior}} {{floors are}} 2700 sq ft. The lower floor has {{what was once}} a lecture hall with raised dais, two study rooms, two bathrooms and a boiler room. A staircase with a Craftsman-style bannister leads up to the main floor, where there are remnants of a cast iron mezzanine for book stacks. Leaded pane glass partitions divide the rooms. Two <b>fireplace</b> <b>surrounds</b> remain at either end.|$|R
50|$|To {{the right}} of the {{entrance}} hall is a lounge room with white marble <b>fireplace,</b> <b>surround</b> and mantle. On the left side of this is a semicircular arched opening and on the right side a blind opening in the same detail. This room opens onto the verandah via French doors in the south and east elevations, and connects to the kitchen (inserted 1985) which has been fitted out in contemporary fashion. The north wall has been extended under the verandah with a timber and glass screen. There is a French door to the verandah in the east wall.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} has 45 rooms covering 13,000 square feet, and boasts exceptionally fine detailing. The {{first floor}} contains a library measuring 23 ft by 23 ft, {{a dining room}} measuring 17 ft by 23 ft, and a reception hall measuring 12 ft by 40 ft with triple staircase. Also {{on the first floor}} are a den with an iridescent tile <b>fireplace</b> <b>surround</b> and painted murals, a kitchen, and pantry space. The second floor had six bedrooms and three bathrooms.

50|$|The {{interior}} is arranged with one room {{on either side}} of the chimney, with a small vestibule in front of it, and a kitchen space behind. The rear corners are taken up by a pantry and lavatory on the west side, and a steep stair climbing to the upstairs on the east. The northwest chamber has a more elaborate <b>fireplace</b> <b>surround</b> than that to the northeast, and was probably the finest room in the house. The fireplace surrounds appear to post-date the construction of the house, because they are clearly based on patterns published by Asher Benjamin in 1806.|$|E
50|$|Internally, the {{building}} has cedar joinery including panelled doors with fanlights, architraves, bays with seats, <b>fireplace</b> <b>surrounds</b> and skirtings. The octagonal shaped central hall has ornate plaster mouldings and cornice, faux marble finish to arches and wall panels and a radiating parquet which continues into {{the front and rear}} halls. Walls are plastered masonry with wallpaper to dado or picture rail height. Ensuite rooms have been added.|$|R
50|$|To its west, in the {{northwest}} wing, is the current dining room, originally the kitchen. It is floored in white oak with a brick <b>fireplace,</b> <b>surrounded</b> by a wooden mantel, set in the east wall, which has a drywall covering over its brown brick. A flagstone hearth {{is in front of}} the fireplace. The walls have a similar combination of baseboard and molding as the other rooms.|$|R
50|$|Bertram Goodhue {{employed}} two New York artists, Lee Lawrie and Hildreth MeiÃ¨re, in {{both the}} exterior and interior ornamentation of the Nebraska State Capitol. Lawrie, a sculptor, designed all of the engaged relief panels and buttress figures of the exterior, along with interior column capitals, doors, and <b>fireplace</b> <b>surrounds.</b> MeiÃ¨re, a muralist, designed the marble mosaic panels of the floors and the ceramic tile panels of the vaults.|$|R
