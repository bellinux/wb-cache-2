Attack by fluoride to give fluorohydrins (11, 12), and by aldehyde (7, 8) at epoxide to give dioxolanes (14, 15, 16, 17) has been shown to occur exclusively by reaction at the tertiary centre. The rearrangements of the 1 -methyl (45, 46), 2 -methyl (47, 48) and 1, 2 -dimethyl. (75, 76) 4 -tert-butylcyclohexane oxides have been rationalised in terms of tertiary carbonium ion intermediates. The initial conformation and structure of the carbonium ion is determined by the requirement that maximum residual overlap of the departing-OBF₃ and the developing electron deficient centre occurs in the transition state. The monomethyl epoxides (45, 48) give a carbonium ion initially in a boat conformation which undergoes conversion to a chair form at a rate comparable to migrational processes. The epoxides (46, 47, 75, 76) are considered to give directly the chair conformation of the carbonium ion intermediate. Significant fluorohydrin formation is observed from all epoxides.
