40|$|The <b>fingerprint</b> {{recognition}} {{problem can}} be grouped into two sub-domains: one is <b>fingerprint</b> verification {{and the other is}} <b>fingerprint</b> identification. In addition, different from the manual approach for <b>fingerprint</b> recognition by experts, the <b>fingerprint</b> recognition here is referred as <b>Fingerprint</b> Recognition System, which is program-based. <b>Fingerprint</b> verification is to verify the authenticity of one person by his <b>fingerprint.</b> The user provides his <b>fingerprint</b> together with his identity information like his ID number. The <b>fingerprint</b> verification system retrieves the <b>fingerprint</b> template according to the ID number and matches the template with the real-time acquired <b>fingerprint</b> from the user.

40|$|This is {{an excerpt}} from the content Synonyms <b>Fingerprint</b> benchmark; Fingerprint corpora; Fingerprint dataset Definition <b>Fingerprint</b> {{databases}} are structured collections of <b>fingerprint</b> data mainly used for either evaluation or operational recognition purposes. <b>Fingerprint</b> data in databases for evaluation are usually detached from the identity of corresponding individuals. These databases are publicly available for research purposes, and they usually consist of raw <b>fingerprint</b> images acquired with live-scan sensors or digitized from inked <b>fingerprint</b> impressions on paper. Databases for evaluation are the basis for research in automatic <b>fingerprint</b> recognition, and together with specific experimental protocols, they are the basis for a number of technology evaluations and benchmarks. This is the type of <b>fingerprint</b> databases further covered here. On the other hand, <b>fingerprint</b> databases for operational recognition are typically proprietary, they usually incorporate personal information about the enrolled people together with the <b>fingerprint</b> data, and they can incorporate either raw <b>fingerprint</b> image data or some form of distinctive <b>fingerprint</b> descriptors such as minutiae templates. These <b>fingerprint</b> databases represent one of the modules in operational automated <b>fingerprint</b> recognition systems, and they will not be adressed here...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Fingerprint</b> {{identification}} {{technology is}} one of the biometric identification technologies that match and recognize the collected <b>fingerprint</b> image to determine the identity of the person. <b>Fingerprint</b> identification technology compared to other biometric identifications is more unique, practical and workable.

40|$|We {{present the}} design and {{manufacturing}} of high fidelity universal 3 D <b>fingerprint</b> targets, which can be imaged {{on a variety of}} <b>fingerprint</b> sensing technologies, namely capacitive, contact-optical, and contactless-optical. Universal 3 D <b>fingerprint</b> targets enable, for the first time, not only a repeatable and controlled evaluation of <b>fingerprint</b> readers, but also the ability to conduct <b>fingerprint</b> reader interoperability studies. <b>Fingerprint</b> reader interoperability refers to how robust <b>fingerprint</b> recognition systems are to variations in the images acquired by different types of <b>fingerprint</b> readers. To build universal 3 D <b>fingerprint</b> targets, we adopt a molding and casting framework consisting of (i) digital mapping of <b>fingerprint</b> images to a negative mold, (ii) CAD modeling a scaffolding system to hold the negative mold, (iii) fabricating the mold and scaffolding system with a high resolution 3 D printer, (iv) producing or mixing a material with similar electrical, optical, and mechanical properties to that of the human finger, and (v) fabricating a 3 D <b>fingerprint</b> target using controlled casting.

40|$|Abstract. Minutiae-based {{representation}} {{is the most}} widely adopted <b>fingerprint</b> representation scheme. The compactness of minutiae template has created an impression that the minutiae template does not contain sufficient information to allow {{the reconstruction of the}} original <b>fingerprint</b> image. This belief has now been shown to be false; several algorithms have been proposed that can reconstruct <b>fingerprint</b> images from minutiae templates. However, these reconstruction techniques have a common weak point: many spurious minutiae, not included in the original minutiae template, are generated in the reconstructed image. Moreover, some of these techniques can only reconstruct a partial <b>fingerprint.</b> In this paper, a novel <b>fingerprint</b> reconstruction algorithm is proposed, which not only reconstructs the whole <b>fingerprint,</b> but the reconstructed <b>fingerprint</b> contains very few spurious minutiae. A <b>fingerprint</b> image is modeled as a 2 D Frequency Modulation (FM) signal whose phase consists of the continuous part and the spiral part (which corresponds to minutiae). An algorithm is proposed to reconstruct the continuous phase from minutiae. The proposed reconstruction algorithm has been evaluated with respect to the success rates of type-I attack (match the reconstructed <b>fingerprint</b> against the original <b>fingerprint)</b> and type-II attack (match the reconstructed <b>fingerprint</b> against the different impressions of the original <b>fingerprint)</b> using a commercial <b>fingerprint</b> recognition system.
