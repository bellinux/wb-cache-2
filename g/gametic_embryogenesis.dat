40|$|Fruit {{breeding}} {{is mainly}} based on both conventional (hybridization, mutation and selection) or biotechnological methods (somatic hybridization, genetic transformation and haploid production). The genetic improvement through the conventional methods {{is limited by}} many factors such as fruit trees long juvenile period, high heterozygosity, large size and sexual incompatibility. Haploids and doubled haploids, obtained through <b>gametic</b> <b>embryogenesis</b> have a potential use in fruit crops genetic improvement. The change of the microspores fate from the normal gametopytic pathway towards the sporophytic induction is affected by numerous factors. Genotype, medium composition and stress were considered {{the most important factors}} required to switch the pollen embryogenic development. During this doctoral course, researches have been carried out on <b>gametic</b> <b>embryogenesis</b> in different fruit crops via anther and isolated microspore culture. Particularly, for the first time, embryos were obtained by isolated microspore culture technique in Citrus spp. Morover, somatic embryogenesis callus and regeneration of plantlets were achieved via anther culture in blood sweet oranges, C. sinensis L. Osbeck, cvs. Moro, Tarocco Meli, Tarocco TDV and Tarocco S. Alfio, homozygous callus, embryos and plantlets were instead obtained from Citrus clementina Hort. ex Tan. cvs. Hernandina and Corsica. These results represent an advancement of plant breeding and propagation techniques in Citrus spp. Research has been also carried out on Olea europaea L. <b>gametic</b> <b>embryogenesis,</b> multicellular structures have been obtained from anther and isolated microspore culture, as the first step towards haploid olive embryos production.

40|$|Nowadays {{there is}} a great {{interest}} in the advancement of the studies on <b>gametic</b> <b>embryogenesis</b> in olive, as a method for obtaining homozygous material, due to the enormous effort and relevance in its genome sequencing and gene mapping. In this study, in vitro isolated microspore culture of four Sicilian olive cultivars ('Biancolilla napoletana', 'Nocellara del Belice', 'Tonda Iblea' and 'Verdello') has been carried out, investigating the influence of two polyamines (putrescine and spermidine) and of two medium compositions on pollen embryogenesis induction. During in vitro development, different structural features have been observed: uninucleated microspores, with no development, binucleated with two asymmetrical nuclei (normal gametophytic pathway: one vegetative and one generative nucleus), binucleated with two equal-size vegetative-type nuclei that had just started their sporophytic pathway, trinucleated, tetranucleated and multinucleated, indicating steps towards the sporophytic development. Moreover, the presence of several calli has been detected. A strong genotype-medium interaction has been observed: each cultivar showed a different response depending on the medium tested. This research represents an advancement in the knowledge about <b>gametic</b> <b>embryogenesis</b> in olive, towards the regeneration of homozygous olive plants...|$|E
40|$|Anther {{culture is}} one of the most widely used methods to induce <b>gametic</b> <b>embryogenesis.</b> The aim of this {{investigation}} was to induce microspore embryogenesis in almond (Prunus dulcis Mill.), through this technique. Anthers were cultured at the vacuolated developmental stage, and seven cultivars, two culture media and two temperature treatments were assessed. Although evidence of the microspore induction was observed in all the genotypes and treatments tested (symmetrical nucleus division and multinucleated structures), calli were produced merely by anthers cultured in the medium P and the regeneration of embryos was detected only in anthers of the cultivars Filippo Ceo, Lauranne and Genco, placed on medium P and subjected to the Control treatment (direct culture at 25 ± 1 °C, without the hot thermal shock at 35 ± 1 °C for 7 days). Characterization by SSR marker analysis of the embryo genotypes revealed that the regenerants had a single allele for each locus whereas the parent cultivar was heterozygous, indicating their development from haploid microspores. This study reports the evidence of <b>gametic</b> <b>embryogenesis</b> and, particularly, of microspore embryogenesis through in vitro anther culture, in almond, and, for the first time to our knowledge, the production of homozygous embryos...|$|E
40|$|Anther {{culture is}} a biotechnological method that allows to obtain, in one step, {{homozygous}} plants, very important to plant breeding, due to their numerous applications in mutation research, selection, genome sequencing, genetic analysis, and transformation. To induce the microspores, i. e., the immature male gametes, to switch from the normal gametophytic pathway to the sporophytic one, {{it is necessary to}} submit them to a type of stress, such as high or low temperature, starvation, or magnetic field. Stress {{can be applied to the}} donor plants and/or the fl oral buds or the anthers or the isolated microspores, before or during the culture. In this chapter, the protocol to induce <b>gametic</b> <b>embryogenesis</b> from anther culture of several cultivars of Citrus clementina Hort. ex Tan. is reported...|$|E
40|$|In vitro {{tissue culture}} {{represents}} a useful {{support for the}} advancement of Citrus breeding and propagation. Haploidy technology, that is the single-step development of complete homozygous genotypes from heterozygous parents through <b>gametic</b> <b>embryogenesis,</b> has already a huge impact on many relevant crops, representing an integral part in their breeding programmes (Germanà 2011 a; 2011 b). In order {{to increase the number of}} genotypes responding to <b>gametic</b> <b>embryogenesis,</b> in vitro isolated microspore culture of Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck cv. Moro, has been carried out, investigating the influence of the culture medium composition, and, particularly, of the plant growth regulator types and concentrations. Meta-topolin, a naturally occurring aromatic cytokinin, is considered an alternative to benzyladenine (BA), zeatin (ZEA) and kinetin (KIN) in plant tissue culture (Aremu et al., 2012), and it is used, mainly, to increase the efficiency of in vitro plant propagation of several species, among them also Citrus (Niedz and Evens, 2011). In this study, metatopolin has been added to the culture medium in substitution of BA and ZEA. After seven months of culture, for all the media tested, different structural features have been observed and registered: microspores uninucleated with no development, binucleated with two asymmetrical nuclei (normal gametophytic pathway: one vegetative and one generative nucleus), binucleated with two equal-size vegetativetype nuclei that had just started their sporophytic pathway, trinucleated, tetranucleated, multinucleated, and, for the first time, calli and embryos at different stages have been obtained. These results indicate an advancement in the knowledge of pollen embryogenesis in Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck cv. Moro. Actually, this is the first time that embryo regeneration from isolated microspore cultures has been reported in sweet orange, a genotype markedly recalcitrant to pollen embryogenesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{improvement}} of the induction rate in Citrus anther culture is important for taking practical advantage of the haploid potential in breeding. The influence of polyamines on anther culture of Citrus clementina, cv Nules, with {{particular attention to the}} free, soluble and insoluble-conjugated polyamine levels, has been investigated. Putrescine, spermidine and putrescine plus spermidine, were added to the standard induction medium. Before culture, spermidine was the most abundant among the free polyamines detected in anthers. The exogenous supply of either putrescine or spermidine, either independently or combined, effected greater uptake and accumulation of polyamines. The addition of 2 mM spermidine to the medium stimulated <b>gametic</b> <b>embryogenesis</b> in clementine Nules, whereas putrescine did not influence embryo production. Regenerants were mostly tri-haploids; a few doubled-haploids and no haploid plants were obtained. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B. V...|$|E
40|$|The {{interest}} of fruit breeders in haploids and doubled haploids (DH), {{lies in the}} possibility of shortening the time needed to produce homozygous lines compared to conventional breeding. Haplo-diploidization through <b>gametic</b> <b>embryogenesis</b> allows single-step development of complete homozygous lines from heterozygous parents. In a conventional breeding programme, a pure line is developed after several generations of selfing. With fruit crops, characterized by a long reproductive cycle, a high degree of heterozygosity, large size, and, sometimes, self-incompatibility, {{there is no way to}} obtain haploidization through conventional methods. This paper reviews the current status of research on doubled haploid production in the main fruit crops: Citrus, Malus domestica, Pyrus communis, Pyrus pyrifolia, Prunus persica, Prunus avium, Prunus domestica, Prunus armeniaca, Vitis vinifera, Actinidia deliciosa, Olea europaea, Morus alba, Actinidia deliziosa, [Musa balbisiana (BB) ], Carica papaya, Annona squamosa, Feijoa sellowiana, Opuntia ficus-indica, Eriobotrya japonica. © Springer 2006...|$|E
40|$|Haploid {{technology}} is a valuable plant breeding tool for obtaining homozygosity particularly in woody plants. Hazelnut, the world’s sixth ranking nut tree crop is a monoecious, anemophilous species. It {{is characterized by a}} sporophytic incompatibility system that prevents production of homozygous plants with conventional methods, involving several self-pollination cycles. In this study, <b>gametic</b> <b>embryogenesis,</b> in particular isolated microspore culture, was tried with five genotypes. Two culture media were tested and four temperature stress treatments were applied to the isolated microspores that were cultivated at the vacuolated developmental stage. To our knowledge, this is the first report of early embryos being recovered from the five hazelnut genotypes via isolated microspore culture. Analysis of the embryo genotypes using SSR markers demonstrated the embryos had a single allele per each locus whereas the parent cultivar was heterozygous, indicating they developed from haploid microspores. The response to the culture treatments, was, however, genotype-dependent, as previously reported for male gamete embryogenesis in other fruit crops...|$|E
40|$|Clementine is {{a natural}} tangor, {{resulting}} from an interspecific cross between mandarin and sweet orange. <b>Gametic</b> <b>embryogenesis,</b> allowing the single-step development of complete homozygous line from the heterozygous parents, increases the efficiency of perennial crop breeding programs. Tri-haploids have been regenerated through pollen embryogenesis (specifically, by anther culture) of Citrus clementina Hort. ex Tan., cv. Nules. Two of them (HOMO 1 and HOMO 2) have been acclimatized and grafted in vivo in 2000. Research regarding the chemical characteristics of plant regenerated by pollen embryogenesis or gynogenesis are useful to study the “gametoclonal variation”, {{as well as for}} further application of haploidy technology in Citrus breeding. For these reasons and with the aim to characterize these homozygous clementine genotypes, in this study leaf essential oils were extracted by Clevenger apparatus and their chemical composition was investigated by capillary GC-MS, comparing them with oils obtained from the heterozygous plant and from its ancestors (clementine is a hybrid between sweet orange and mandarin). The obtained oil compositions, submitted to a statistical analysis, are partitioned into groups using principal components analysis (PCA) and, compared to those of both parents, distinguished in three major chemotypes sabinene/linalool, γ-terpinene and methyl N-methylanthranilate...|$|E
30|$|For plant systems, anther {{culture is}} used to produce haploids and di-haploids (DHs) via <b>gametic</b> <b>embryogenesis</b> for a single-step {{development}} of complete homozygous lines from heterozygous parents. Regeneration from male gametes {{has been reported in}} more than 200 species belonging to the Solanaceae, Cruciferae and Gramineae families (Dunwell 1986; Hu and Yang 1986). In rice, the regeneration rate is in general is more than 5 green plantlets/ 100 anthers. This technique has been further used with TE mutagenesis to obtain homozygous mutants (Kikuchi et al. 2003; Dong et al. 2012). TE allows for creating mutagenesis in abundant germline cells and the subsequent anther culture allows for producing DHs. Yet, these experiments have involved use of native TEs without attempting to promote transposition efficiency or controlling the transposition specifically in germinal cells. Thus, the transposition events may occur in regenerated somatic DH cells, which results in heterozygous mutant plantlets. Several successful transposon-tagging experiments in plants indicated that the Ac/Ds system is a valuable tool for rice functional genomic studies (Zhu et al. 2003, 2004; Komatsu et al. 2003). Previously, we constructed a one-time inducible transposon, COKC, by fusing the transposase gene with a chemically inducible PR- 1 a promoter (Charng et al. 2008; Tai et al. 2011). COKC was introduced into rice plants and could be successfully induced by the inducer salicylic acid (SA) to trigger transposition events. Here, we assessed the use of TE mutagenesis with rice anther culture to produce biallelic mutants from COKC-containing transgenic rice.|$|E
40|$|Microspore {{embryogenesis}} is {{a method}} of achieving complete homozygosity from plants. It is particularly useful for woody species, like Citrus, characterized by long juvenility, {{a high degree of}} heterozygosity and often self-incompatibility. Anther culture is currently the method of choice for microspore embryogenesis in many crops. However, isolated microspore culture is a better way to investigate the processes at the cellular, physiological, biochemical and molecular levels as it avoids the influence of somatic anther tissue. To exploit the potential of this technique, it is important to separate the key factors affecting the process and, among them, culture medium composition and particularly the plant growth regulators and their concentration, as they can greatly enhance regeneration efficiency. To our knowledge, the ability of meta-Topolin, a naturally occurring aromatic cytokinin, to induce <b>gametic</b> <b>embryogenesis</b> in isolated microspores of Citrus has never been investigated. In this study, the effect of two concentrations of meta-Topolin instead of benzyladenine or zeatin in the culture medium was investigated in isolated microspore culture of two genotypes of Citrus. After eleven months of isolated microspore culture, for both genotypes and for all the four tested media, the microspore reprogramming and their sporophytic development was observed by the presence of multinucleated calli and microspore-derived embryos at different stages. Microsatellite analysis of parental and embryo samples was performed to determine the embryo alleles constitution of early embryos produced in all tested media, confirming their origin from microspores. To our knowledge, this is the first successful report of Citrus microspore embryogenesis with isolated microspore culture in Citrus, and in particular in Citrus clementina Hort. ex Tan, cvs. ‘Monreal Rosso’ and ‘Nules’...|$|E
30|$|Anther {{culture is}} used {{specifically}} in plant systems to produce haploids and DHs through <b>gametic</b> <b>embryogenesis</b> {{and allows for}} a single-step development of complete homozygous lines from heterozygous parents. In a few wheat species, the efficiency to regenerate DH plantlets from anther culture can be up to 30 % (Lantos et al. 2013). In general, in rice, the regeneration rate is more than 5 green plantlets/ 100 anthers. Thus, this technique has been further used with native transposon mutagenesis (Kikuchi et al. 2003; Dong et al. 2012). To promote transposition efficiency and control transposition specifically in germinal cells, we assessed {{the use of an}} inducible transposon, COKC, to create DH mutant rice plants. To rule out spontaneous transposition events without induction (Tai et al. 2011), we preliminarily identifed 5 starter lines. We used two induction methods and, with pot SA treatment, the germinal transposition efficiency was up to 5 % from regeneration calli. All regenerated plantlets were identified as homozygous mutants (Table  1 and Figure  5), so the germinal transposition events were successfully induced. With culture treatment, the transposition efficiency was up to 20 %. Yet, many regenerated plantlets yielded untransposed COKC signals (Figure  3 c), so the transposition events occurred during calli regeneration, which resulted in heterogeneity of the transposed COKC. Considering that rice anther culture yields a 5 % regeneration rate, our results indicate that incubating 2, 000 anthers from starter lines containing COKC can yield approximately 100 independent regenerated rice plantlets and 6 homozygous mutants. Since a high regeneration rate (up to 25 %) has been reported in a commercial rice line (Islam et al. 2004), our technique can reduce the number of starter anthers needed by 5 -fold.|$|E
40|$|Isolated microspores of Brassica napus are developmentally {{programmed}} to form gametes; however, microspores can be reprogrammed through stress treatments to undergo appropriate divisions and form embryos. We {{are interested in}} the identification and isolation of factors and genes associated with the induction and establishment of embryogenesis in isolated microspores. Standard and normalized cDNA libraries, as well as subtractive cDNA libraries, were constructed from freshly isolated microspores (0 h) and microspores cultured for 3, 5, or 7 d under embryogenesis-inducing conditions. Library comparison tools were used to identify shifts in metabolism across this time course. Detailed expressed sequence tag analyses of 3 and 5 d cultures indicate that most sequences are related to pollen-specific genes. However, semiquantitative and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses at the initial stages of embryo induction also reveal expression of embryogenesis-related genes such as BABYBOOM 1, LEAFY COTYLEDON 1 (LEC 1), and LEC 2 as early as 2 to 3 d of microspore culture. Sequencing results suggest that embryogenesis is clearly established in a subset of the microspores by 7 d of culture and that this time point is optimal for isolation of embryo-specific expressed sequence tags such as ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3, ATS 1, LEC 1, LEC 2, and FUSCA 3. Following extensive polymerase chain reaction-based expression profiling, 16 genes were identified as unequivocal molecular markers for microspore embryogenesis in B. napus. These molecular marker genes also show expression during zygotic embryogenesis, underscoring the common developmental pathways that function in zygotic and <b>gametic</b> <b>embryogenesis.</b> The quantitative expression values of several of these molecular marker genes are shown to be predictive of embryogenic potential in B. napus cultivars (e. g. ‘Topas’ DH 4079, ‘Allons,’ ‘Westar,’ ‘Garrison’) ...|$|E
40|$|Embryogenesis is a {{morphogenic process}} {{which leads to}} the {{production}} of a bipolar structure containing a root-shoot axis with a closed independent vascular system - the embryo. Three types of embryogenesis are considered based on the plant material from which the embryo derives: zygotic (zygote), somatic (somatic tissues) and gametic (microspores and ovules). Somatic and <b>gametic</b> <b>embryogenesis</b> to be considered as "true-to-type" should mimic the embryonic developmental stages of zygotic embryogenesis. Although real suspensor-like cells are often not present in somatic embryogenesis, the similarity between zygotic and somatic embryogenesis is remarkable from the globular to the early cotyledon stages. Somatic embryogenesis can be induced in vitro, in callus, cell suspension cultures, and protoplast cultures (indirect embryogenesis), or directly from cells of organized structures such as leaves or zygotic embryos (direct embryogenesis). As an approach for plantlet regeneration, somatic embryogenesis has several advantages over organogenesis providing useful systems to obtain large-scale clonal propagation and artificial seeds, and for clonal propagation of transgenic plants. For these reasons, the control of plant regeneration by somatic is, at present, one of the major goals of agrobiotechnology. The lack of knowledge of the factors controlling somatic embryogenesis, the asynchrony of somatic embryo development, and low true-to-type embryonic efficiency, are responsible for its reduced commercial application and, they simultaneously, have been the driving force of the fundamental research studies performed in the last decades. Although some basic knowledge of the process of somatic embryogenesis in dicotyledonous species has been achieved through the Daucus carota experimental model system, knowledge of the factors responsible for inducing the process and the meaning of embryogenic competence is still lacking. The complexity of the process and the lack of a good experimental model system are frequently suggested as being responsible for the lack of progress achieved [...] Available from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.
