500|$|In {{an impromptu}} {{interview}} following the match, a clearly upset Solo criticized Ryan's decision. [...] "It {{was the wrong}} decision, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>anybody</b> that knows anything about the game knows that. There's {{no doubt in my}} mind I would have made those saves. And the fact of the matter is it's not 2004 anymore. It's not 2004. And it's 2007, and I think you have to live in the present. And you can't live by big names. You can't live in the past. It doesn't matter what somebody did in an Olympic gold medal game in the Olympics three years ago. Now is what matters, and that's what I think." [...] Many viewed her comments as being critical of Scurry's performance, although Solo released an apologetic statement the following day saying that was not her intent. On September 29, 2007, coach Greg Ryan announced that Solo would not be with the team and would not play in the third-place match against Norway the following day. Team captain Kristine Lilly stated that the decision on Solo was made by the team as a group. The U.S. went on to win against Norway 4–1.|$|E
2500|$|Yorke {{has been}} {{critical}} of the music industry and has pioneered alternative release platforms with Radiohead and his solo work. Following Radiohead's 1993 Pablo Honey tour of America, he became disenchanted with being [...] "right at the sharp end of the sexy, sassy, MTV eye-candy lifestyle" [...] he felt he was helping sell. The 1998 documentary Meeting People Is Easy portrays Yorke's disaffection with the music industry and press during Radiohead's OK Computer tour. After Radiohead's fourth album, Kid A (2000), was leaked via the peer-to-peer filesharing software Napster weeks before release, Yorke told Time he felt Napster [...] "encourages enthusiasm for music {{in a way that the}} music industry has long forgotten to do. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>anybody</b> sticking two fingers up at the whole fucking thing is wonderful as far as I'm concerned." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{his next}} single, [...] "The Fightin' Side of Me," [...] {{released}} by his record company in 1970 over Haggard's objections, Haggard's lyrics {{stated that he}} did not mind the counterculture [...] "switchin' sides and standin' up for what they believe in," [...] but resolutely declared, [...] "If you don't love it, leave it!" [...] In May 1970, Haggard explained to John Grissom of Rolling Stone, [...] "I don't like their views on life, their filth, their visible self-disrespect, y'know. They don't give a shit what they look like or what they smell like.... What do they have to offer humanity?" [...] In a 2003 interview with No Depression magazine, Haggard said, [...] "I had different views in the '70s. As a human being, I've learned [...] I have more culture now. I was dumb as a rock when I wrote 'Okie From Muskogee.' That's being honest with you at the moment, and {{a lot of things that}} I said [...] I sing with a different intention now. My views on marijuana have totally changed. I think we were brainwashed and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>anybody</b> that doesn't know that needs to get up and read and look around, get their own information. It's a cooperative government project to make us think marijuana should be outlawed." ...|$|E

I guess it's just my fear of sounding one-dimensional, or being classified as strictly a folk artist.|$|E

5000|$|McLaughlin {{has been}} cited as a major {{influence}} on many 1970s and 1980s guitarists. Examples are prominent players such as Steve Morse, Eric Johnson, Mike Stern, Al Di Meola, Shawn Lane, and Scott Henderson. Current players still hold him as highly influential, including Omar Rodríguez-López of the Mars Volta, Paul Masvidal of Cynic, and Ben Weinman of The Dillinger Escape Plan. According to Pat Metheny, McLaughlin has changed the evolution of the guitar during several of his periods of playing. McLaughlin is also considered {{a major influence on}} composers in the fusion genre. In an interview with Downbeat, Chick Corea remarked that [...] "what John McLaughlin did with the electric guitar set the world on its ear. No one ever heard an electric guitar played like that before, and it certainly inspired me. John's band, more than my experience with Miles, led me to want to turn the volume up and write music that was more dramatic and made your hair stand on end". Frank Zappa said of McLaughlin: [...] "A person would be a moron not to appreciate McLaughlin's technique. The guy has certainly found out how to operate a guitar {{as if it were a}} machine gun. But I'm not always enthusiastic about the lines I hear or the ways in which they're used. I don't think you can fault him, though, for the amount of time and effort it must have taken to play an instrument that fast. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>anybody</b> who can play that fast is just wonderful. And I'm sure 90% of teenage America would agree, since the whole trend in the business has been 'faster is better'." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "All of the ballplayers in {{the movie}} were prepped for the film by Rod Dedeaux. He coached at USC for many years, and is a {{wonderful}} man, very full of life, energetic, very supportive, just really was very giving of himself and cheerful all the time, was a great spirit to have around. And one day, we were in between setups and I said, 'Hey, coach, what position did you play?' He said, 'I was a shortstop.' I said, 'Really, could you -- were you good?' He got very quiet, and he said, 'I could field the ball.' I said, 'Could you hit?' He said, 'I could hit the ball.' And he was strangely quiet. And I said to him, 'Well, how come you never played in the majors?' And he said, 'I did.' I said, 'Really?' said 'Yes, in 1930-something.' I forget what year he said. He was the starting shortstop for the Brooklyn Dodgers. He played one game, broke his back, {{and that was the}} end of his career.And I just blanched. I said, 'My God, you're Doc Graham.' He said, 'That's right.' And I said, 'Do you ever think about, [...] "gee, the career I might've had."' And he said, 'Every day.' He said it very quietly. It was very out of character for him, and I was so touched by that. And I did look him up in the Baseball Encyclopedia: He did go, I think, 1-for-4 with an RBI. That was his lifetime stats. So having him be the man who trained all these fellows, including the kid who plays Doc Graham, was very meaningful to me, and I know it was to him, too. It was great to have him around. I think about that often, about what that must have been like, to be good enough to start with a Major League team, and for one unlucky moment, not be able to do -- the rest of your life takes another turn. What he did with that is, he put all of that emotion -- which could have gone into bitterness or regret -- into being a phenomenal coach. He sent more people to the majors than, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>anybody</b> else in college history. He's an amazing man." ...|$|E
