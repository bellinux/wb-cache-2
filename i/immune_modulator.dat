40|$|Pneumococcal {{meningitis}} is {{an infectious}} {{disease of the}} central nervous system (CNS) caused by the Gram positive bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae. The immune response in the CNS against S. pneumoniae is thought to be a cause of the pneumococcal meningitis related brain damage that results in long-term sequelae including deafness and cognitive impairment. In normal situation there are, due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB), no <b>immune</b> <b>modulators</b> present in the CNS, with the exception of microglia, the macrophages of the CNS. Pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) on and in microglia, including Toll-like receptors (TLR; mainly 2, 4 and 9), Nod-like receptors (NLR) and SIGN-R 1 (a C-type lectin receptor) are thought to be responsible for the activation of microglia. These microglia are then able to secrete immune modulatory factors including cytokines, chemokines, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and complement factors. Various and some contradictory effects of the secreted cytokines have been seen in pneumococcal meningitis. While chemokines appear to be primarily responsible for recruitment of leukocytes, MMPs (especially MMP- 9) are mainly responsible for the breakdown of the BBB what makes it possible for leukocytes to enter the brain. Complement factors seem to have various functions in the immune response during pneumococcal meningitis, but one important function is to activate leukocytes. Microglia and some leukocytes are able to phagocytize pathogens and secrete reactive nitrogen (RNS) and oxygen (ROS) species, with the intention to eliminate S. pneumoniae out of the CNS. In summary, the host innate immune response during pneumococcal meningitis is very complex and is formed by many <b>immune</b> <b>modulators</b> which can both induce and prevent brain injury. In the future long-term sequelae as a result of pneumococcal meningitis could be reduced by inhibition of pro-inflammatory <b>immune</b> <b>modulators</b> or by stimulation of anti-inflammatory <b>immune</b> <b>modulators.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The trace {{elements}} copper, zinc, and selenium are important <b>immune</b> <b>modulators</b> and essential cofactors of the antioxidant enzymes. In the present study, the proliferative effect of human peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) {{that have been}} exposed to copper, zinc, and selenium and the corresponding activities of antioxidant enzymes, namely superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase, were determined. Zinc and copper stimulated the PBMC proliferation in a dose-dependent manner within the dose range 25 - 200 Î¼mol/L. SOD and GPx activities in PBMCs exposed to zinc were inhibited, whereas catalase activity was unaffected. All the three antioxidant enzymes in the cells exposed to copper were inhibited. Selenium exerted more potent inhibition of the cell proliferation while causing stimulation of the antioxidant enzymes at the lowest dose (25 Î¼mol/L) than at the highest dose (200 Î¼mol/L) tested. A significant negative correlation was observed between proliferation and antioxidant enzyme (SOD and GPx) activities in traceelement-exposed PBMC.
