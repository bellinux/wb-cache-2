5|$|In the January 2003 general {{election}}, the LPF shrank to 5.7% {{support and}} eight seats. Following the election the LPF was exchanged for the Democrats 66 {{in the government}} coalition, and would <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to maintain support in opposition. Besides Joost Eerdmans, most of its Members of Parliament were not very visible, while party leader Herben had enough work just keeping the party from further infighting. The party also went into financial straits, and as the new coalition continued most of the former coalition's policies, {{it was hard for}} the LPF to oppose the government.|$|E

The {{students}} are all disabled, retarded and of different ages. Teaching them is a hard job. They are of the 3rd grade {{but many of them}} <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to do the reading. Only a few of them can. Their pronunciation is distorted due to their twisted lips and their memory is quite short. They easily forget what they've learned... In the Village, it is quite hard to tell the kids' exact ages. Some in their twenties have a physical statures as small as the 7- or 8-years-old. They find it difficult to feed themselves, much less have mental ability or physical capacity for work. No one can hold back the tears when seeing the heads turning round unconsciously, the bandy arms managing to push the spoon of food into the mouths with awful difficulty... Yet they still keep smiling, singing in their great innocence, at the presence of some visitors, craving for something beautiful.|$|E

25|$|A {{defensive}} {{field is}} one in which most of the field is covered by a fielder; the batsman will therefore <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to score large numbers of runs.

Britain was perilously near to exclusion from the mainland of Europe, and would <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to make contact with its continental allies. With the capitulation of Ath in early October France controlled much of the Austrian Netherlands. Saxe, now raised to heroic status in his adopted country, was soon threatening Brussels and Antwerp.|$|E
25|$|Cape Verde is 97% Christian and its {{background}} is {{a fusion of}} African, Asian, European and South American backgrounds, where about 70% is African and mixed. Less than 30% is African, whereas about 1% is of unmixed European descent. Because of this, Cape Verdeans <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to define themselves as either mixed or Africans. They regard themselves as either both or as unique Cape Verdeans. Politically, Cape Verdeans also worked {{as part of the}} Portuguese administration, with independence leader Amílcar Cabral being part of the colonial administration in Guinea-Bissau and Angola.|$|E

50|$|Poverty {{brings with}} it {{heightened}} stress, social exclusion, malnutrition, violence and trauma, all of which contribute to mental illness. It is a vicious cycle: people living with mental illness experience widespread stigma and discrimination, suffer violence and abuse, and <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> to get work, get an education or contribute to their family and community. They {{are more prone to}} other forms of illness and disease, and <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> to access health care.|$|R

A native with mainly water signs {{will be very}} {{emotional}} and <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to look at anything dispassionately. They tend to respond slowly to questions and need time to grasp a new concept. Water subjects can {{find it difficult to}} explain their feelings, and so can be difficult to live with, but they are also kind and sympathetic to those they love. They need to give and receive a lot of affection and will direct it towards family, close friends and animals. A subject lacking water may lack intuition and be unable to see the needs of others. They may be too full of ideas or too fond of the material world to consider their own spiritual needs or those of other people. Planets in the 4th, 8th and 12th houses in the chart will help to compensate for this lack.|$|E
25|$|Government TVETs are {{particularly}} concerned with occupations requiring investment in {{machinery and equipment}} and with increasing provision in remote areas. Workshop provision varies in quality. Some TVETs have good provision but many others have a shortage of workshops or old dilapidated workshops that lack safety features, basic sanitary facilities and essential equipment. Classrooms, stores and libraries may be in poor condition or non-existent. Instructors may lack competence since, in 2012, only 53% of those assessed met the assessment criteria. Even when TVETs have machinery and equipment, {{there are too many}} students for the few resources available. Students cannot meet the 70% to 80% requirement for practice and training remains theory based. Consequently, students have difficulty in meeting the assessment criteria with only 23% of students being found competent in 2012. Students who do graduate may still <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to get work. The Amhara TVET promotion bureau found only about 40% of TVET graduates managed to obtain employment.|$|E

30|$|Against this, {{there are}} reasons why migration-innovation {{channels}} may be limited. A diverse team may <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> to communicate, and levels of trust may also be lower (Alesina and Ferrara 2005). As a result, organisations may <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> to make decisions or allocate resources, {{and the quality of}} those decisions may be lower than in more homogenous organisations. Similarly, if knowledge flows only within diasporic communities, this will limit the scope of knowledge spillovers. Finally, diverse organisations may also face discrimination from other market actors.|$|R
500|$|The Castle Doctrine {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics, {{with a score}} on review aggregator Metacritic of 58/100. Patrick Carlson of PC Gamer reviewed the game well, responding positively to the game rewarding experimentation and being easy to understand, describing it as thoughtfully designed. Game Informer's Daniel Tack also rated the game well, commenting particularly on its creativity, stating though {{that he did not}} think the game was [...] "deep enough to stay interesting for long." [...] Writing for Destructoid, Patrick Hancock shared Tack's opinion that the game was a good experience, but said he would <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to recommend.|$|E
500|$|These {{conditions}} create [...] "maximum surplus appropriation"; workers' {{daily lives}} revolve around factory production and {{are dependent on}} the economic conditions. The state disallows local unionization and has the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) as the legitimate forum of worker representation. Without the right to form unions and with the state sanctioned ACFTU, migrant women workers <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to effectively gain suitable rights and treatment from the factory management. The 2003 statistics from the People's University show 90% of migrants work without contracts, directly violating the Chinese Labour Law. According to the ACFTU, migrant workers are owed over 100 billion Yuan in back wages.|$|E

He told Bloomberg News that [...] "People say that we are responsible for the situation we find ourselves in. OK, sure. But I think that Germany will <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to argue that in 1953 [...] they were completely blameless." [...] He appeared in various international media as a spokesperson for Syriza and making the case for their policies: among others, he was interviewed on Lateline, an Australian news programme on ABC, by SBS, another Australian news channel, was quoted by the BBC and Bloomberg, and also appeared in an Intelligence Squared debate arguing for the motion 'Angela Merkel is Destroying Europe'.|$|E

Gordon drew on her experience with Burkhardt to take on the storyline. Home and Away's producer, Cameron Welsh, approached Gordon about the storyline and asked her if she would be comfortable doing it. Gordon called it an [...] "amazing opportunity to be given". Gordon said [...] "The producer asked me if I wanted to do this storyline and made sure I was comfortable doing it based on what I had been through, I definitely think this one tops all of them".

500|$|The monarch {{butterfly}} (Danaus plexippus) {{is a member}} of a Müllerian complex with the viceroy butterfly (Limenitis archippus), sharing coloration patterns and display behaviour. The viceroy has subspecies with somewhat different coloration, each closely matching the local Danaus species. For example, in Florida, the pairing is of the viceroy and the queen butterfly, whereas in Mexico the viceroy resembles the soldier butterfly. The viceroy is thus involved in three different Müllerian pairs. This example was long believed to be Batesian, with the viceroy mimicking the monarch, but the viceroy is actually the more unpalatable species. The genus Morpho is palatable, but some species (such as M. amathonte) are strong fliers; birds – even species that specialize in catching butterflies on the wing – <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to catch them. The conspicuous blue coloration shared by most Morpho species may be Müllerian, or may be [...] "pursuit aposematism".|$|E

[...] The impetuous Ta asks Linda to marry him. [...] She agrees, but she needs family consent and lies, saying that she has a brother who will approve the marriage. [...] Ta returns home and meets Mei Li, who is immediately attracted to him ("I Am Going to Like It Here"), though Ta is unimpressed.

500|$|Stanley {{praises the}} series saying [...] "It's not clear exactly why this bleak series is so exhilarating and binge-worthy. It {{could be that}} just as victims of tragedy <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to accept that their {{suffering}} is random and purposeless, voters find it intolerable {{that so many of}} the petty, shortsighted moves by elected officials have no greater meaning than small-time expediency." [...] She also notes that the series [...] "is more cynical than The Americans on FX and more pessimistic about human nature than The Walking Dead on AMC". However, The Americans [...] "is more complex and inventive" [...] according to Stanley who concurs that season 2 is darker but notes it is more compelling than season 1. [...] Stuever compares the show unfavorably to both Veep for its [...] "bumbling chaos and ego implosions" [...] over House of Cards [...] "prohibitively sinister" [...] execution and The Good Wife for its superior delivery of [...] "nastiness and self-interest in power plays".|$|E
500|$|... "Beautiful Liar" [...] {{was written}} by Mikkel S. Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen, Amanda Ghost, Ian Dench, and Beyoncé. It was {{produced}} by Eriksen and Hermansen using their stage name, Stargate, and Beyoncé. Eriksen told Sound on Sound, [...] "This song is very simple. Most {{of the time we}} have more chords in a song, because we <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> writing a great song on just one chord. But if you do it right, you can make it work, and this song is an example." [...] The track had already been written in 2006. Eriksen and Hermansen played it to their manager, Tyran Smith, who said that it would be perfect for a duet between Shakira and Beyoncé. Eriksen and Hermansen considered this to be impossible, however Smith was devoted to that idea. As they had no lyric or top melody, various writers attempted to finish the song. The first three attempts were not satisfactory, and Smith put Eriksen and Hermansen to work together with Ghost and Dench, who wrote {{a significant part of the}} lyrics and the melody.|$|E
500|$|Oblivion {{received}} universal acclaim from critics, {{and became}} a commercial success. The game had shipped 1.7million copies by April 10, 2006, sold over 3million copies by January 2007, and over 3.5 million by November 2011. Electronic Entertainment Design and Research, a market research firm, estimates that the game has sold 9.5 million copies worldwide. Reviewers praised the game for its impressive graphics, expansive game world and schedule-driven NPCs. Eurogamer editor Kristan Reed stated that the game [...] "successfully unites {{some of the best}} elements of RPG, adventure and action games and fuses them into a relentlessly immersive and intoxicating whole". GameSpot's Greg Kasavin wrote that compared to Morrowind, {{which was one of the}} best role-playing games he has seen in years, [...] "Oblivion is hands-down better, so much so that even those who'd normally have no interest in a role-playing game should <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to resist getting swept up in this big, beautiful, meticulously crafted world". X-Plays Jason D'Aprile stated, [...] "All the games in this series have been known for their sheer vastness and freedom of choice, but the Elder Scrolls IV takes that concept and runs with it".|$|E
