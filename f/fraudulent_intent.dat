50|$|At the time, {{common law}} {{was that if}} the horse was sold after the rental {{contract}} had expired, this was larceny {{since there was no}} longer a contract in force for possession. If the renter intended to return the horse, and therefore had legal possession (custody) then was later forced to sell it because of unforeseen circumstances, this would be a breach of trust, but would not be felony larceny. The fact that the renter had no lodging was used to show a <b>fraudulent</b> criminal <b>intent</b> from the beginning, whereby the act of taking and selling the horse did not transfer legal possession to Pear for the day, and his act of taking and selling the horse was found to be felonious larceny.|$|R

This paper suggests that scope of operation of savings clauses is exceeding small. Those cases in which lenders find themselves exposed to fraudulent conveyance liability are only rarely ones in which a savings clause is of much use. Savings clauses are useful to guard against constructive fraudulent conveyance attacks, but only in environments in which actual <b>intent</b> <b>fraudulent</b> conveyances attacks are also possible and for these savings clauses do little good. Even when in environments in which they might protect a lender, uncertainties in how they operate may restrict their usefulness, especially in the context of guarantees...|$|R

The defendant is answerable for the conversion, {{no matter how good}} his intentions were, or how careful he has been, or how apparently well-founded was his belief that his tortious act was right. The existence of probable cause does not preclude liability. A person may be liable for conversion even though he was reasonably mistaken in thinking the facts to be such as would give him a legal right to the goods.|$|E

40|$|Imagine {{buying a}} game from a seller and {{promising}} to repay {{him at a}} later date. However, instead of repayment, you decide to give the game to your friend, who in turn allows you to use it. Then your friend declares bankruptcy to discharge {{the price of the}} game from his debts, thus allowing you both to use it without paying. This repayment runaround is the issue that the First and Fifth Circuits were asked to decide in two recent cases. Specifically, the question was whether a debt incurred by “actual fraud” may be discharged by the recipient of the transfer without a misrepresentation of repayment. The Bankruptcy Code (“the Code”) serves as a vehicle to help those who have encountered unsuccessful ventures to discharge their obligations and start anew. The Code does not, however, grant a debtor the absolute right of discharge, as many exceptions exist to prevent fraudulent behavior. One of these exceptions is 11 U. S. C. § 523 (a) (2) (A), which excepts from discharge any debt obtained by “false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud. ” Circuit courts have differed in their application of the statute, thus creating a circuit split concerning whether a debtor must make a misrepresentation in order to constitute “actual fraud. ” This Note argues that “actual fraud” is meant to encompass a <b>fraudulent</b> transferee’s <b>intent</b> to defraud and does not require a misrepresentation concerning the prospect of repayment. By focusing on the transferee’s intent, these debts would be nondischargeable, thus requiring repayment to the seller...|$|R

50|$|The {{ability of}} a {{creditor}} to undo a fraudulent or voluntary conveyance depends on the specific type of creditor and transfer at issue. If the creditor had obtained a judgment {{at the time of}} the conveyance, then the creditor will be able to avoid it. However, a creditor that reduces the debt owed to it to a judgment only after the conveyance has occurred must prove that the conveyance was indeed fraudulent, for the purpose of defrauding creditors. This is a very difficult standard to prove, but the state does provide some statutory presumptions of <b>fraudulent</b> <b>intent.</b> In particular, a transfer between spouses or close family members is presumed to be fraudulent unless proved otherwise, as is renunciation of a gift received by a beneficiary under a will. However, a conveyance to a bona fide purchaser for fair value can not be upset where the purchaser is unaware of the <b>fraudulent</b> <b>intent</b> of the conveyor.|$|E

In 1912, Congress responded with the Sherley Amendments, which addressed the perceived lack of enforcement of fraud related to therapeutic claims;: The Act was amended to prohibit false and fraudulent claims of health benefits, but enforcement under the amendment required proof of <b>fraudulent</b> <b>intent,</b> a difficult standard.|$|E
50|$|To Austrian philatelists, Sigmund Friedl {{is known}} mainly for his Friedl {{perforations}} and the disreputable Friedl forgeries.

5000|$|Generally, {{the federal}} circuit courts have adhered {{to one of}} two {{approaches}} when dealing with honest services fraud cases.

The other, the [...] "materiality" [...] test, requires that the defendant possessed a <b>fraudulent</b> <b>intent</b> and made [...] "any misrepresentation that has the natural tendency to influence or is capable of influencing" [...] the victim to change his behavior.|$|E
50|$|President Franklin Delano Roosevelt {{signed the}} new Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) into law on June 24, 1938.

This law, though extensively amended in subsequent years, remains the central foundation of FDA regulatory authority to the present day.|$|E
5000|$|The {{responsibility}} for examining food and drugs for such [...] "adulteration" [...] or [...] "misbranding" [...] {{was given to}} Wiley's USDA Bureau of Chemistry.

Held that “the aggrieved {{holder of}} {{somewhat}} {{less than one}} share of stock in defendant” failed to plead facts sufficient to raise the strong inference of fraud required to meet the specificity requirements for pleading fraud under Rule 9(b). Jacobs held that executives in a corporation are entitled to be optimistic about their future earnings, {{and the fact that}} their predictions turn out to be wrong in hindsight is insufficient to establish scienter. Jacobs also held that the requisite motive to give rise to an inference of <b>fraudulent</b> <b>intent</b> requires more than a general desire to “prolong the benefits of the positions” held by executives.|$|E

50|$|Parkes sat in this {{parliament}} {{for about}} six months but then resigned at the end of August 1858 on account of his insolvency. His liabilities were estimated at £50,000 and his assets at £48,500. On the literary side the Empire was an excellent paper, but only a man of great business acumen could have made a financial success of it at this period. The issuing of a certificate of insolvency was bitterly opposed and the proceedings were long drawn out. It is evident that Parkes had resorted to the usual shifts of a man in financial difficulties, but it was shown that, in some cases at least, he had acted under the advice of his banker, and he was ultimately exonerated by the chief commissioner in insolvency of any <b>fraudulent</b> <b>intent.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{key idea}} is {{in using the}} image of the private key in signing/verification formulas. These are not actual images that would {{contribute}} greatly to blockchain bloat, but rather a number, which corresponds to each private key one-to-one (deterministically derived from it by the cryptographic hash function). The key image cannot be used to derive the private key and public address, but since every key image spent is stored in the blockchain, the network will block any duplicates. Likewise, any attempt to create a key image would not fit into the mathematical formula during a transaction verification and will be denied. The downside to this is that {{it would be impossible to}} identify anyone who attempts to perform a double spend with <b>fraudulent</b> <b>intent</b> or as a result of software or human error. The system, however, will block such attempts.|$|E
5000|$|Wiley {{used these}} new {{regulatory}} powers {{to pursue an}} aggressive campaign against the manufacturers of foods with chemical additives, but the Chemistry Bureau's authority was soon checked by judicial decisions, {{as well as by}} the creation of the Board of Food and Drug Inspection and the Referee Board of Consulting Scientific Experts as separate organizations within the USDA in 1907 and 1908 respectively. A 1911 Supreme Court decision ruled that the 1906 act did not apply to false claims of therapeutic efficacy, in response to which a 1912 amendment added [...] "false and fraudulent" [...] claims of [...] "curative or therapeutic effect" [...] to the Act's definition of [...] "misbranded." [...] However, these powers continued to be narrowly defined by the courts, which set high standards for proof of <b>fraudulent</b> <b>intent.</b> In 1927, the Bureau of Chemistry's regulatory powers were reorganized under a new USDA body, the Food, Drug, and Insecticide organization.

5000|$|There are {{two types}} of {{fraudulent}} transfer—actual fraud and constructive fraud. Actual fraud typically involves a debtor who as part of an asset protection scheme donates his assets, usually to an [...] "insider", and leaves himself nothing to pay his creditors. Constructive fraud does not relate to <b>fraudulent</b> <b>intent,</b> but rather to the underlying economics of the transaction, if it took place for less than reasonably equivalent value {{at a time when the}} debtor was in a distressed financial condition. It is important to notice that the actual distinction between the two different types of fraud is what the intentions of the debtor were. For example, where the debtor has simply been more generous than they should have or, in business transactions, the business should have ceased trading earlier to preserve capital (see generally, wrongful trading). In a successful suit, the plaintiff is entitled to recover the property transferred or its value from the transferee who has received a gift of the debtor's assets. Subsequent transferees may also be targeted, although they generally have stronger defenses than immediate transferees.|$|E
5000|$|Charles Sumner again {{met with}} President Lincoln on the Smiths' behalf. The {{president}} asked Sumner {{to review the}} lengthy report from the Navy Secretary which identified the key elements in the court-martial, then render an opinion. Senator Sumner studied the document overnight and wrote an opinion which summarized the treatment of Franklin Smith: [...] "It is hard that citizens enjoying a good name, who had the misfortune to come into business relations with the Government, should be exposed to such a spirit; {{that they should be}} dragged from their homes, and hurried to a military prison; that, though civilians, they should be treated as military offenders; that they should be compelled to undergo a protracted trial by courtmartial, damaging their good name, destroying their peace, breaking up their business, and subjecting them to untold expense,—when, at the slightest touch, the whole case vanishes into thin air, leaving behind nothing but the incomprehensible spirit in which it had its origin. Of course, the findings and sentence of the Court ought, without delay, to be set aside. But this is only the beginning of justice. Some positive reparation should be made to citizens who have been so deeply injured."After reflection, the president wrote his decision to Welles, the court-martial board and the Navy: [...] "I am unwilling for the sentence to stand and be executed, to any extent, in this case. In the absence of a more adequate motive than the evidence discloses, I am wholly unable to believe in the existence of criminal or <b>fraudulent</b> <b>intent</b> on the part of one of such well-established good character as is the accused. If the evidence went as far toward establishing a guilty profit of one or two hundred thousand dollars, as it does of one or two hundred dollars, the case would, on the question of guilt, bear a far different aspect. That on this contract, involving from one million to twelve hundred thousand dollars, the contractors should attempt a fraud which at the most could profit them only one or two hundred, or even one thousand dollars, is to my mind beyond the power of rational belief. That they did not, in such a case, strike for greater gains proves that they did not, with guilty or <b>fraudulent</b> <b>intent,</b> strike at all. The judgment and sentence are disapproved and declared null, and the accused ordered to be discharged."Lincoln never got the opportunity to [...] "lay my long hand upon them" [...] who pursued the Smiths. A few short weeks after the president vacated the sentence, he was killed by an assassin's bullet.|$|E
50|$|After Price had exposed Schneider, various {{scientists}} such as Karl Przibram and {{the magician}} Henry Evans wrote to Price {{telling him that}} they agreed that Schneider evaded control during his séances and congratulated Price {{on the success of}} unmasking the fraud. In opposition, SPR members who were highly critical of Price, supported Schneider's mediumship and promoted a conspiracy theory that the Price photograph was a hoax. SPR member Anita Gregory claimed Price had deliberately faked the photograph to discredit SPR research and ruin Schneider's reputation. The psychologist Alan Gauld wrote that Gregory's analysis of the photograph was misconceived and there was no direct evidence the photograph taken by Price had been tampered with. In opposition to Gregory the photographic expert Vernon Harrison testified that the photograph was genuine. Harrison suggested that instead of fraud the shock of the flash caused Schneider to jerk involuntarily breaking free from the control, and when the second flash went off, recorded him in that position. SPR member John L. Randall who reviewed the Price and Schneider case also came to the conclusion the photograph was genuine. However, Randall disagreed with Harrison that Schneider's movement was accidental and wrote the photograph was evidence for Price's claim that Schneider had freed his hand with <b>fraudulent</b> <b>intent.</b>|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the element of scienter (<b>fraudulent</b> <b>intent)</b> in claims of federal securities fraud under Section 10 (b) of the Exchange Act and, more specifically, the U. S. Supreme Court’s decision in Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues 2 ̆ 6 Rights, Ltd., 551 U. S. 308 (2007) from a social psychological perspective. The field of social psychology has documented a pervasive phenomena, the Fundamental Attribution Error, the failure of decision makers to consider situational explanations, including the force of environments and social and situational norms on human conduct. In light of robust social psychological research on the Fundamental Attribution Error, legal concepts such as intent, intentionality, mens rea, and scienter should be reexamined and reconstructed. In Tellabs, the Supreme Court instructed federal courts to dismiss federal securities complaints, unless a reasonable person would deem the inference of scienter to be cogent, and at least as compelling as any opposite inference one could draw from factual allegations in the complaint. The Courts of Appeals are divided, however, on whether this framework applies at summary judgment. When viewed from a social psychological perspective, Tellabs promotes effective judicial decision making. Tellabs broadens the epistemic goal of decision making to include consideration of both dispositional and situational factors. When federal courts explicitly consider alternative explanations and causes of the defendants’ actions, jurists {{are more likely to}} consider situational explanations and avoid the Fundamental Attribution Error, resulting in more accurate decisions. Tellabs, therefore, offsets the tendency to over-attribute <b>fraudulent</b> <b>intent</b> to conduct appearing unreasonable only in hindsight...|$|E

We find that at least $ 11 million has been contributed to the scams from 13 000 distinct victims. Furthermore, we present evidence that the most successful scams depend on large contributions from a very small number of victims. Finally, we discuss ways in which the scams could be countered. ...|$|E
