25|$|The verse of Waking in December, Thakore's {{first book}} shows a reverence for {{definite}} form and {{an interest in}} classical structures like the sonnet and the villanelle, exemplified in poems like Chandri Villa or What <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>Get</b> away with. This interest in classical forms is linked to his training as a Hindustani classical vocalist and composer.|$|E

I have sometimes wondered why I must file papers showing I did not steal my car before <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> a license for it. But experience shows there are thieves among automobile drivers, and that there are Communists among labor leaders. The public welfare, in identifying both, outweighs any affront to individual dignity.|$|E

500|$|In 1904, in {{his early}} twenties, Joyce emigrated {{permanently}} to continental Europe with his partner (and later wife) Nora Barnacle. They lived in Trieste, Paris and Zurich. Though {{most of his adult}} life was spent abroad, Joyce's fictional universe centres on Dublin, and is populated largely by characters who closely resemble family members, enemies and friends from his time there. Ulysses in particular is set with precision in the streets and alleyways of the city. Shortly after the publication of Ulysses, he elucidated this preoccupation somewhat, saying, [...] "For myself, I always write about Dublin, because if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> to the heart of Dublin <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> to the heart of all the cities of the world. In the particular is contained the universal." ...|$|E
500|$|Bill Lawrence {{expressed}} {{that he hoped}} that Aniston's guest appearance would mark {{a turning point in}} viewership opinions, and felt that the show had distanced itself from its original concept. [...] "I want as many people as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> to see what the show kind of became last year," [...] Lawrence articulated. [...] "It went from a typical TV show trying to find itself to something that I’m really proud of and like and think is really funny." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode guest starred Phyllis Somerville, {{known for}} her recent work on the Showtime series The Big C that ended in her character's death.

The episode also featured one-time guest star Ken Pogue as Alice's husband Derek.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{securing}} a record deal, Pru had found inspiration for her music in {{artists such as}} Cassandra Wilson and Dianne Reeves. She wrote song lyrics and poetry while attending high school and then Texas Southern University, coupling her lyrics with the music of other artists such as Michael Jackson, Rachelle Ferrell, Sade, Naughty by Nature, the Isley Brothers, and Miles Davis. While discussing her approach to songwriting, Pru elaborated: [...] "From a word, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> a whole picture, a visual. The song becomes a poem, almost like a thesis." [...] She considered her music {{as a form of}} poetry, citing the album track [...] "Hazy Shades" [...] {{as an example of a}} poem turned into a song.|$|E

500|$|Following the 2010 season, Kafka {{said that}} his goal for the 2011 offseason was to [...] "continue to learn the offense.

There's a bunch of things I can work on, and I'm really excited to get to it." [...] Eagles general manager Howie Roseman said Kafka is the hardest working player in the NFL, but needs to get bigger and stronger. The Eagles reportedly received trade offers from other teams for Kafka prior to the 2011 NFL Draft but declined due to his potential.

500|$|Director Brad Bird {{stated in}} 2007 {{that he was}} open {{to the idea of}} a sequel if he could come up with an idea {{superior}} to the original film: [...] "I have pieces that I think are good, but I don't have them all together." [...] During an interview in May 2013, Bird reiterated his interest in making a sequel. [...] "I have been thinking about it. People think that I have not been, but I have.

[...] Lesbian culture website AfterEllen.com opined [...] "she doesn't seem like the type of woman to give up without a fight" [...] where Sarah and Mike are concerned.

500|$|Chabon's work, however, remains {{popular in}} Hollywood, with Rudin {{purchasing}} the film rights to The Yiddish Policemen's Union, then titled Hatzeplatz, in 2002, {{five years before}} the book would be published. The same year, Miramax bought the rights to Summerland and Tales of Mystery and Imagination (a planned collection of eight genre short stories that Chabon has not yet written), each of which was optioned for a sum in the mid-six figures.
