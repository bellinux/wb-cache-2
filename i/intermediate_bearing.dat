40|$|Nonlinear {{dynamic model}} of a coaxial rotor system was {{established}} with a method combining the finite {{element method and the}} fixed interface modal synthesis method. Then an implicit time domain method was presented to solve the nonlinear equations of motion; thus dynamic characteristics of the rotor system can be obtained. With nonlinear forces of squeeze film damper and <b>intermediate</b> <b>bearing</b> considered, nonlinear dynamic response characteristics of the co- and counterrotating coaxial rotor system under multiple unbalance forces were studied and compared in this work. It was found that the critical speeds of the corotating system were equal to or slightly higher than those of the counterrotating case due to the gyroscopic moments. The results showed that the unbalance excitation frequencies are dominant in the responses of the rotor system. Besides, due to coupling effect of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>bearing</b> some combinations of the unbalance excitation frequencies were also observed in the spectrogram but the combinations were different for co- and counterrotating cases.

40|$|ABSTRACTImmediate {{hypersensitivity}} {{reactions to}} mannitol present naturally in pomegranate (Punica granatum) and cultivated mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) {{have appeared in}} the medical literature recently. Mannitol, being inert, cannot react with proteins to form a hapten–carrier conjugate and elicit an immune response. Therefore, {{it is important to understand}} the mechanism of immediate hypersensitivity to this sugar alcohol. A likely mechanism was conceptualized to explain how an individual can become sensitized to mannitol and how free mannitol can elicit an anaphylactic reaction in the sensitized individual. The proposed mechanism for sensitization involves the reaction of D-mannose with exposed amino groups of proteins in vivo to form Schiff base intermediates bearing a D-mannitoyl moiety, which closely resembles D-mannitol. This intermediate appears to be responsible for eliciting the formation of mannitol- specific IgE in susceptible individuals. Once an individual is sensitized with the formation of mannitol-specific IgE, mannitol can cause anaphylactic reactions by acting either as a univalent anaphylactogen or a bivalent hapten. The Schiff base <b>intermediate</b> <b>bearing</b> the mannitoyl moiety appears to act as a true sensitizer, whereas D-mannose appears to act as prosensitizer and D-mannitol acts as a non-sensitizing elicitor. This hypothesis can also explain the mechanism of sensitization and IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to any sugar alcohol...|$|E

This paper presents few interesting case studies of the failed components of SWCC desalination plants in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

40|$|Graduation date: 2018 This {{thesis is}} {{separated}} into three distinct projects. First, synthetic studies towards the furanosteroid viridin shown in part I. Second, synthetic studies towards the diperene obtusanal shown in part II. Third, the analysis, characterization, and synthesis of coronene derivatives towards their application in organic batteries shown in part III. 	Significant synthetic progress towards viridin {{has been made}} in our laboratory. We showcased the first total synthesis directed application of a proline sulfonamide-catalyzed, asymmetric Yamada-Otani cyclization as a key step to enantioselectively form the A ring of viridin from acyclic achiral aldehyde and enone precursors. In addition, we demonstrate an unprecendented, palladium-mediated oxidative furan formation to install the hallmark furan moiety from a diol and alkene functional groups. 	Significant progress towards obtusanal {{has been made in}} our laboratory culminating in the synthesis of the complete carbon bicyclic scaffold of obtusanal. In addition to using a common synthetic intermediate from the viridin project, we established several key transformations. First, a sequential two-step palladium-catalyzed functionalization of the bromo,chloro aromatic moiety. We successfully functionalized the aromatic moiety in high yield across multiple substrates through a Negishi cross-coupling selectively for the aryl bromide with minimal β-hydride elimination, followed by a palladium-catalyzed oxygenation of the aryl chloride. Second, we show a biomimmetically-inspired intramolecular aldol cyclization to set the complete scaffold of obtusanal as a single diasteromer. The intramolecular aldol reaction appears to be mediated by silica gel on an <b>intermediate</b> <b>bearing</b> a silyl enol ether and aldehyde functionality. 	The dense and functionally diverse structure of the intermediates leading to obtusanal necessitated careful reagent selection and intermediate functional group selection. All told, we examined five separate approaches towards obtusanal, and synthetized an advanced intermediatebranched from the second generation “OMe series” sequence, differing from obtusanal only by differing a C 6 alkene versus aldehyde, and C 12 -OMe verses OAc. 	We report the synthesis of a new carbonylated PAH coronenehexaanhydride {{to be used as a}} cathode material in batteries and conducted NMR analysis of the coronene-based materials within organic batteries. We were able to produce coronenehexaanhydride over two steps from coronene; however, application of the material by the Ji laboratory reported low voltage potential for the material.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} development of a methodology and modelling approach to lower the mechanical noise of the drive train of a modern wind turbine with a strong focus on the wind turbine gearbox. Although this mechanical noise is not the main noise source from a wind turbine, it could - especially when it contains audible tonal components - result in non-conformity to local noise regulations. This becomes more stringent when wind turbines are installed closer to urbanised areas. This research is motivated by inefficiencies in a cost and time consuming reactive trial and error approach to reduce or remove audible mechanical tonalities from the wind turbine noise. This dissertation focusses on the mechanical tonalities linked with the wind turbine gearbox. This mechanical noise originates from the interaction between the gears inside the gearbox, and then propagates directly airborne through the air or indirectly structure-born through the other wind turbine components to the outside. Two fundamental approaches exist to reduce or to remove a mechanical tonality. The first approach attempts to reduce the noise source by optimising the gears for low-noise. The second approach modifies the propagation path, also called transfer path from the source to the listener, such that the noise originating from the noise source is not amplified or even attenuated when it reaches the listener. The methodology proposed in this dissertation focusses on the second approach: using virtual prototyping models to assess and to optimise these transfer paths. The development of this methodology consists of 3 main parts: firstly individual components of the wind turbine gearbox are investigated in detail and if necessary experimentally validated. Secondly these individual components are assembled into a wind turbine gearbox model. The impact of these individual components on the global eigenmodes of the gearbox are investigated, and the model of the complete gearbox is experimentally validated by performing an experimental modal analysis. Lastly a model of two gearboxes on the end-of-line test rig is generated, investigated and also experimentally validated. This step-by-step approach, including the numerous experimental validation cases, resulted in a significant increase in both insight and confidence in the dynamic behaviour predicted by these virtual prototyping models. This dissertation demonstrates this methodology and modelling approach by performing two optimisation cases. The first optimisation case focusses on the impact of the bearings on the resulting vibrations. The second optimisation case modifies the flexible gearbox housing, which is considered the most dominant component, to shift an important eigenmode out of the operating range of the wind turbine. Both these optimisation cases clearly illustrate the potential of pro-actively using virtual simulation models to optimise the noise and vibration behaviour of the wind turbine gearbox during its design.

This arrangement is sometimes used in V6 and V8 engines as it enables {{the engine to}} be designed with different V angles than what would otherwise be required to create an even firing interval, while still using fewer main bearings than would normally be required with a single piston per crankthrow. This arrangement reduces weight and engine length {{at the expense of}} less crankshaft rigidity.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- In Vertical {{submerged}} turbine pumps {{the long}} shafts are supported at intervals by transmission bearings. The radial load acting on shaft is taken care by the <b>intermediate</b> <b>bearings.</b> These transmission bearings are lubricated by the flowing liquid through pump. During starting as water level is below line shaft bearing it requires prepublication before start. Selection of the bearing material becomes critical {{in situations where}} we don’t have pre lubrication water available. Also remote start and stop is difficult. In this scenario pump runs dry during initial start. Our aim is to develop bearing which {{will take care of}} dry running. When pumped water is sea water / raw water containing sand/abrasive particles then line shaft sleeve bearing should withstand against wear. To cater the problems in conventional bearings and to find the appropriate bearing material focus is given on latest trends & Tribological developments in the world. Different PTFE based composite bearing. In this study, composite materials were comparatively investigated under actual load and sliding velocities by using in a Pump. The influence of inorganic fillers MoS 2, on the wear of the glass & bronze fabric reinforced epoxy composites under dry & wet running conditions has been checked. Bronze filled PTFE bearing are found excellent and will serve as an alternative to conventional bearings...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{mechanism}} of mammalian gene replacement was investigated. The system is based on detecting homologous recombination between transferred vector DNA and the haploid, chromosomal immunoglobulin μ-δ region in a murine hybridoma cell line. The backbone of the gene replacement vector (pCμCδpal) consists of pSV 2 neo sequences bounded on one side by homology to the μ gene constant (Cμ) region {{and on the other}} side by homology to the δ gene constant (Cδ) region. The Cμ and Cδ flanking arms of homology were marked by insertions of an identical 30 -bp palindrome which frequently escapes mismatch repair when in heteroduplex DNA (hDNA). As a result, <b>intermediates</b> <b>bearing</b> unrepaired hDNA generate mixed (sectored) recombinants following DNA replication and cell division. To monitor the presence and position of sectored sites and, hence, hDNA formation during the recombination process, the palindrome contained a unique NotI site that replaced an endogenous restriction enzyme site at each marker position in the vector-borne Cμ and Cδ regions. Gene replacement was studied under conditions which permitted the efficient recovery of the product(s) of individual recombination events. Analysis of marker segregation patterns in independent recombinants revealed that extensive hDNA was formed within the Cμ and Cδ regions. In several recombinants, palindrome markers in the Cμ and Cδ regions resided on opposite DNA strands (trans configuration). These results are consistent with the mammalian gene replacement reaction involving two crossing-over events in homologous flanking DNA...|$|R

The reed valve blocks served as <b>intermediate</b> main <b>bearings.</b> Because the valves occupied space already necessary for the main bearings instead of mounting to {{an extension of the}} crankcase, crankcase volume was minimized, resulting in a higher crankcase compression ratio, and more power in proportion to displacement than the competition.|$|R
40|$|Bioengineering {{of viruses}} and virus-like {{particles}} (VLPs) is a well-established {{approach in the}} development of new and improved vaccines against viral and bacterial pathogens. We report here that the capsid of a major avian pathogen, infectious bursal dis-ease virus (IBDV), can accommodate heterologous proteins to induce protective immunity. The structural units of the 70 -nm-diameter T 13 IBDV capsid are trimers of VP 2, which is made as a precursor (pVP 2). The pVP 2 C-terminal domain has an amphipathic helix that controls VP 2 polymorphism. In the absence of the VP 3 scaffolding protein, 466 -residue pVP 2 <b>intermediates</b> <b>bearing</b> this helix assemble into genuine VLPs only when expressed with an N-terminal His 6 tag (the HT-VP 2 - 466 protein). HT-VP 2 - 466 capsids are optimal for protein insertion, as they are large enough (cargo space, 78, 000 nm 3) and are assembled from a single protein. We explored HT-VP 2 - 466 -based chimeric capsids initially using enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). The VLP assembly yield was efficient when we coexpressed EGFP-HT-VP 2 - 466 and HT-VP 2 - 466 from two re-combinant baculoviruses. The native EGFP structure (240 copies/virion) was successfully inserted in a functional form, as VLPs were fluorescent, and three-dimensional cryo-electronmicroscopy showed that the EGFPmolecules incorporated at the inner capsid surface. Immunization of mice with purified EGFP-VLPs elicited anti-EGFP antibodies. We also inserted hemagglu-tinin (HA) andmatrix (M 2) protein epitopes derived from the mouse-adapted A/PR/ 8 / 34 influenza virus and engineered several HA- andM 2 -derived chimeric capsids. Mice immunized with VLPs containing the HA stalk, anM 2 fragment, or both antigens developed full protection against viral challenge...|$|R
40|$|The {{secondary}} ent-beyeran- 16 -yl carbocation (7) {{is a key}} {{branch point}} intermediate in mechanistic schemes to rationalize the cyclic structures of many tetra- and pentacyclic diterpenes, including ent-beyerene, ent-kaurene, ent-trachylobane, and ent-atiserene, presumed precursors to 3 ̆e 1000 known diterpenes. To evaluate these mechanistic hypotheses, we synthesized the heterocyclic analogues 16 -aza-ent-beyerane (12) and 16 -aza-ent-trachylobane (13) by means of Hg(II) - and Pb(IV) -induced cyclizations onto the ∆ 12 double bonds of tricyclic <b>intermediates</b> <b>bearing</b> carbamoylmethyl and aminomethyl groups at C- 8. The 13, 16 -seco- 16 -norcarbamate (20 a) was obtained from ent-beyeran- 16 -one oxime (17) by Beckmann fragmentation, hydrolysis, and Curtius rearrangement. The aza analogues inhibited recombinant ent-kaurene synthase from Arabidopsis thaliana (GST-rAtKS) with inhibition constants (IC 50) 1 × 10 - 7 and 1 × 10 - 6 M) similar in magnitude to the pseudo-binding constant of the bicyclic ent-copalyl diphosphate substrate (Km) 3 × 10 - 7 M). Large enhancements of binding affinities (IC 50) 4 × 10 - 9 and 2 × 10 - 8 M) were observed {{in the presence of}} 1 mM pyrophosphate, which is consistent with a tightly bound ent-beyeranyl+/ pyrophosphate- ion pair intermediate in the cyclization-rearrangement catalyzed by this diterpene synthase. The weak inhibition (IC 50) 1 × 10 - 5 M) exhibited by ent-beyeran- 16 -exo-yl diphosphate (11) and its failure to undergo bridge rearrangement to kaurene appear to rule out the covalent diphosphate as a free intermediate. 16 -Aza-ent-beyerane is proposed as an effective mimic for the ent-beyeran- 16 -yl carbocation with potential applications as an active site probe for the various ent-diterpene cyclases and as a novel, selective inhibitor of gibberellin biosynthesis in plants...|$|R
40|$|The B 2 antigen {{characterized}} {{by means of}} a monoclonal antibody (14) is a 140, 000 Mr protein expressed only in certain stages of the differentiation of lymphocytes of the B lineage. Here we examine the relationship between B 2 and the membrane complement receptor type 2 (CR 2) for the complement fragment C 3 d (11, 12), which is also associated only with B cells. Both phenotypic markers are distributed in a similar manner among B cell malignancies and, as shown here, among established cell lines. A polypeptide with binding affinity for C 3 d was isolated from the membrane of B 2 -positive cells, i. e., tonsil lymphocytes and Raji cells. We found that this C 3 d-binding protein not only had the same Mr and isoelectric point (pI) as the B 2 antigen, but that it was recognized by the monoclonal antibody to B 2. However, anti- B 2 does not mask the ligand-binding site of CR 2 since it does not prevent the interaction of the purified 140, 000 Mr polypeptide with immobilized C 3 d. Rosette formation between tonsil lymphocytes and erythrocyte <b>intermediates</b> <b>bearing</b> C 3 d was specifically inhibited by anti-B 2. In the case of Raji cells, rosette formation was strongly inhibited only when the lymphocytes were sequentially treated with anti- B 2 and with a polyclonal antibody against mouse Ig. In short, B 2 and CR 2 have a similar distribution among normal and malignant cells, have the same Mr and pI under denaturing conditions, and react with a single monoclonal antibody. We conclude that B 2 is identical to CR 2...|$|R

This thesis describes the synthesis and feeding of isotopically labelled enriched substrates to elucidate features of a new mevalonate independent pathway to isoprenoids. Chapter 2 describes studies with a whole plant system, Mentha citrata, which produces the monoterpene linalyl acetate, and a bacterium Escherichia coli which produces ubiquinone- 8. Feeding experiments with stable isotopically enriched compounds demonstrate that the terpene unit of linalyl acetate is biosynthesised via the mevalonate independent pathway, hicorporation of deuterium from [6, 6 -(^ 2) H(_ 2) ]-glucose, [(^ 2) H(_ 3) ]-alanine and [(^ 13) C(^ 2) H(_ 3) ]-alanine into luialyl acetate show that the conversion to isopentenyl pyrophosphate does not proceed via a series of dehydrations. Feeding experiments with putative <b>intermediates</b> <b>bearing</b> deuterium into E. coli show {{that none of the}} intermediates are incorporated. This suggests that E. coli lacks a kinase to activate exogenously administered substrates fed as the free alcohols. Chapter 3 outlines biosynthesis studies on a meroterpene rosnecatone produced by the fungus R. necatrix. Intact incorporation of (^ 13) C from the feeding of [l, 2 -(^ 13) C(_ 2) ]-acetate shows that the terpenoid moiety is produced via the mevalonic acid pathway and the non-terpenoid unit is polyketide derived. Incorporation of deuterium from [6, 6 -(^ 2) H(_ 2) ]-glucose fully describes the pentaketide that delivers the non-terpenoid fragment. The effect on the metabolite production of changing the growth conditions of R. necatrix is investigated. Changing from a static culture to a submerged cultures causes an increased rate of growth, an upregulation of the production of cytochalasan E and a cessation of rosnecatone production. Screening of rosnecatone against two Human cancer cell lines shows IC(_ 50) values of 4. 48 µM and 5. 78 µM...|$|R
