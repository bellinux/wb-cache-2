He also supported H.R. 1872, the Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014, which would have modified the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs, including requiring the federal budget to reflect the net impact of programs administered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, such that the debt of those two programs would be included in the national debt. [...] He also supported H.R. 1871, the Baseline Reform Act of 2013, which would have discontinued the practice of automatic increases for inflation in projecting discretionary appropriations in CBO's baseline budgeting. Arguing in favor of H.R. 1871, Ryan said that [...] "families don't get automatic raises every year. Neither should Washington". He said that these three budget reform bills [...] "are an important step toward restoring fiscal discipline in Washington". Ryan claimed that [...] "by improving the budget process, we can get a better handle on our spending problem".
