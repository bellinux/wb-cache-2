5|$|<b>Kermes</b> {{is a red}} dye {{from the}} dried bodies of the females of a scale insect in the genus <b>Kermes,</b> {{primarily}} <b>Kermes</b> vermilio. <b>Kermes</b> are native to the Mediterranean region, living on the sap of the <b>Kermes</b> oak. They were used as a red dye by the ancient Greeks and Romans. The <b>kermes</b> dye is a rich red, and has good colour fastness in silk and wool.|$|E
5|$|Dyestuffs {{including}} carmine (cochineal), shellac, and <b>kermes</b> {{have been}} made from the bodies of insects. In classical times, Tyrian purple was extracted from sea snails such as Stramonita haemastoma (Muricidae) for the clothing of royalty, as recorded by Aristotle and Pliny the Elder.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Slavs {{developed}} {{a method of}} obtaining red dye from the larvae of the Polish cochineal. Despite the labor-intensive process of harvesting the cochineal and a relatively modest yield, the dye {{continued to be a}} highly sought-after commodity and a popular alternative to <b>kermes</b> throughout the Middle Ages until it was superseded by Mexican cochineal in the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|Now in {{complete}} control of the Firm, Morris took an increased interest {{in the process of}} textile dyeing and entered into a co-operative agreement with Thomas Wardle, a silk dyer who operated the Hencroft Works in Leek, Staffordshire. As a result, Morris would spend time with Wardle at his home on various occasions between summer 1875 and spring 1878. Deeming the colours to be of inferior quality, Morris rejected the chemical aniline dyes which were then predominant, instead emphasising the revival of organic dyes, such as indigo for blue, walnut shells and roots for brown, and cochineal, <b>kermes,</b> and madder for red. Living and working in this industrial environment, he gained a personal understanding of production and the lives of the proletariat, and was disgusted by the poor living conditions of workers and the pollution caused by industry; these factors greatly influenced his political views. After learning the skills of dyeing, in the late 1870s Morris turned his attention to weaving, experimenting with silk weaving at Queen's Square.|$|E
5|$|The main ore {{of mercury}} is cinnabar, long {{used as a}} pigment by painters. He says that the colour is similar to scolecium, {{probably}} the <b>kermes</b> insect. The dust is very toxic, so workers handling the material wear face masks of bladder skin. Copper and bronze are, says Pliny, most famous for their use in statues including colossi, gigantic statues as tall as towers, the most famous being the Colossus of Rhodes. He personally saw the massive statue of Nero in Rome, which was removed after the emperor's death. The face of the statue was modified shortly after Nero's death during Vespasian's reign, {{to make it a}} statue of Sol. Hadrian moved it, {{with the help of the}} architect Decrianus and 24 elephants, to a position next to the Flavian Amphitheatre (now called the Colosseum).|$|E
5|$|Until 1927, {{the exact}} shades of the {{national}} colors were not legally specified. In practice, the actual hue, particularly of red, depended {{on what kind of}} red dye was available. In pre-partition Poland, crimson, due to its high price, was a color associated with the rich and the privileged. It could be obtained from the domestically harvested Polish cochineal, although imported alternatives were also available: <b>kermes</b> from the Mediterranean Basin (hence karmazyn, the Polish name of the color) and Mexican cochineal after the discovery of the New World. Crimson was reserved for the nobility and considered a symbol of the aristocracy, so that karmazyn became synonymous with a magnate. A royal ban on wearing this color could be a form of punishment; in the 14th century, the Nałęcz clan of Greater Poland were forbidden to dress in crimson for their ancestors' complicity in the assassination of King Premislaus in 1296. In {{the first half of the}} 19th century, due to the influence of French fashion, crimson was largely replaced with the cheaper amaranth.|$|E
25|$|The carmine {{of antiquity}} also {{contains}} carminic acid, and was extracted {{from a similar}} insect, <b>Kermes</b> vermilio, which lives on Quercus coccifera oaks native to the Near East and the European side of the Mediterranean Basin. <b>Kermes</b> carmine {{was used as a}} dye and a laked pigment in ancient Egypt, Greece, and the Near East {{and is one of the}} oldest organic pigments. Recipes for artists' use of carmine appear in many early painting and alchemical handbooks throughout the Middle Ages; the laking process for both pigments was improved in the 19th century. Carmine was not light-fast and was largely abandoned in art.|$|E
25|$|This aria {{has been}} {{performed}} in concert by many musical theatre and opera stars, including (in {{addition to those}} listed above): Natalie Dessay, Diana Damrau, Sumi Jo, Edita Gruberová, Renée Fleming, Simone <b>Kermes,</b> Roberta Peters, and Dawn Upshaw.|$|E
25|$|Regulations {{governing}} {{the use of}} expensive Tyrian purple dyestuffs varied over the years, but cloth dyed in these colours was generally restricted to specific classes and was used in diplomatic gifts. Other dyes used in Byzantine silk workshops were madder, <b>kermes,</b> indigo, weld, and brazilwood. Gold thread was made with silver-gilt strips wrapped around a silk core.|$|E
25|$|Aegean and Western Turkey {{sclerophyllous}} {{and mixed}} forests: These Mediterranean-climate forests occupy the coastal lowlands and valleys of western Anatolia bordering the Aegean Sea. The ecoregion has forests of Turkish pine (Pinus brutia), oak forests and woodlands, and maquis shrubland of Turkish pine and evergreen sclerophyllous trees and shrubs, including Olive (Olea europaea), Strawberry Tree (Arbutus unedo), Arbutus andrachne, <b>Kermes</b> Oak (Quercus coccifera), and Bay Laurel (Laurus nobilis).|$|E
25|$|Skopelos {{is one of}} the greenest {{islands in}} the Aegean Sea. The island has a wide range of flowers, trees and shrubs. The local {{vegetation}} is chiefly made up of forests of Aleppo Pines (Pinus halepensis), <b>Kermes</b> Oaks (Quercus coccifera), a small forest of Holm Oaks (Quercus ilex), Oleo-Ceratonion maquis, fruit trees and olive groves. The pine forests on Skopelos have replaced oak species that predominated in the past; this is due to a preference for pine trees, since their timber is widely used for ship construction.|$|E
25|$|In 1297 king Denis of Portugal took {{personal}} interest {{in the development of}} exports, having organized the export of surplus production to European countries. On May 10, 1293 he instituted a maritime insurance fund for Portuguese traders living in the County of Flanders, which were to pay certain sums according to tonnage, accrued to them when necessary. Wine and dried fruits from Algarve were sold in Flanders and England, salt from Setúbal and Aveiro was a profitable export to northern Europe, and leather and <b>kermes,</b> a scarlet dye, were also exported. Portuguese imported armors and munitions, fine clothes and several manufactured products from Flanders and Italy.|$|E
25|$|The Alicante {{province}} {{also has}} a mostly dry Mediterranean to Continental Mediterranean climate. These are the innermost part of the province (for example Villena) and some closer to the sea but at a higher elevation (for example Alcoy). Here winters are cool to cold {{and a few days}} of snow are not unusual; summers are mild to hot and rains at about 500mm average and slightly more evenly distributed through the year than in the previous mentioned areas. The innermost part of this domain is more quite dry while the mountainous part reach slightly higher precipitation figures which allow <b>Kermes</b> Oak woods to thrive, such as the one in La Carrasqueta or in the Mariola range, both near Alcoy.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{cochineal}} {{was used}} for colouring fabrics. During the colonial period, {{with the introduction of}} sheep to Latin America, the use of cochineal increased, as it provided the most intense colour and it set more firmly on woolen garments than on clothes made of materials of pre-Hispanic origin such as cotton or agave and yucca fibers. In general, cochineal is more successful on protein-based animal fibres (including silk) than plant-based material. Once the European market discovered the qualities of this product, the demand for it increased dramatically. By the beginning of the 17th century, it was traded internationally. Carmine became strong competition for other colourants such as madder root, <b>kermes,</b> Polish cochineal, Armenian cochineal, brazilwood, and Tyrian purple, as they were used for dyeing the clothes of kings, nobles, and the clergy. For the past several centuries, it was the most important insect dye used in the production of hand-woven oriental rugs, almost completely displacing lac. It was also used for painting, handicrafts, and tapestries. Cochineal-coloured wool and cotton are important materials for Mexican folk art and crafts.|$|E
500|$|Tyrian purple {{retained}} its {{place as the}} premium dye of Europe until it was replaced [...] "in status and desirability" [...] by the rich crimson reds and scarlets of the new silk-weaving centers of Italy, colored with <b>kermes.</b> [...] <b>Kermes</b> is extracted from the dried unlaid eggs of the insect <b>Kermes</b> vermilio or Kermococcus vermilio found on species of oak (especially the <b>Kermes</b> oak of the Mediterranean region). [...] The dye is of ancient origin; jars of <b>kermes</b> {{have been found in}} a Neolithic cave-burial at Adaoutse, Bouches-du-Rhône. Similar dyes are extracted from the related insects Porphyrophora hamelii (Armenian cochineal) of the Caucasus region, Porphyrophora polonica (Polish cochineal or Saint John's blood) of Eastern Europe, and the lac-producing insects of India, Southeast Asia, China, and Tibet.|$|E
500|$|When kermes-dyed {{textiles}} achieved prominence {{around the}} mid-11th century, the dyestuff was called [...] "grain" [...] in all Western European languages because the desiccated eggs resemble fine grains of wheat or sand. [...] Textiles dyed with <b>kermes</b> {{were described as}} dyed in the grain. Woollens were frequently dyed in the fleece with woad and then piece-dyed in <b>kermes,</b> producing a wide range colors from blacks and grays through browns, murreys, purples, and sanguines. [...] By the 14th and early 15th century, brilliant full grain <b>kermes</b> scarlet was [...] "by far the most esteemed, most regal" [...] color for luxury woollen textiles in the Low Countries, England, France, Spain and Italy.|$|E
500|$|In medieval Europe, purple, violet, murrey {{and similar}} colors were {{produced}} by dyeing wool with woad or indigo in the fleece and then piece-dyeing the woven cloth with red dyes, either the common madder or the luxury dyes <b>kermes</b> and cochineal. [...] Madder could also produce purples when used with alum. [...] Brazilwood also gave purple shades with vitriol (sulfuric acid) or potash.|$|E
500|$|Throughout history, {{people have}} dyed their {{textiles}} using common, locally available materials, but scarce dyestuffs that produced brilliant and permanent colors {{such as the}} natural invertebrate dyes, Tyrian purple and crimson <b>kermes,</b> became highly prized luxury items in the ancient and medieval world. Plant-based dyes such as woad (Isatis tinctoria), indigo, saffron, and madder were raised commercially and were important trade goods in the economies of Asia and Europe. Across Asia and Africa, patterned fabrics were produced using resist dyeing techniques to control the absorption of color in piece-dyed cloth. [...] Dyes such as cochineal and logwood (Haematoxylum campechianum) were brought to Europe by the Spanish treasure fleets, and the dyestuffs of Europe were carried by colonists to America.|$|E
500|$|Cochineal (Dactylopius coccus) is a {{scale insect}} of Central and North America {{from which the}} crimson-coloured dye carmine is derived. It {{was used by the}} Aztec and Maya peoples. Moctezuma in the 15th century {{collected}} tribute in the form of bags of cochineal dye. Soon after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire cochineal began to be exported to Spain, and by the seventeenth century it was a commodity traded as far away as India. [...] During the colonial period the production of cochineal (in Spanish, grana fina) grew rapidly. Produced almost exclusively in Oaxaca by indigenous producers, cochineal became Mexico's second most valued export after silver. Cochineal produces purplish colors alone and brilliant scarlets when mordanted with tin; thus cochineal, which produced a stronger dye and could thus be used in smaller quantities, replaced <b>kermes</b> dyes in general use in Europe from the 17th century.|$|E
2500|$|The carmine {{dyestuff}} of Porphyrophora hamelii {{owes its}} red color almost entirely to carminic acid, {{making it difficult}} to distinguish chemically from the dyestuff of cochineal from the Americas. [...] The dyestuff of Porphyrophora polonica can be distinguished by its small admixture of kermesic acid, which is the major constituent of <b>kermes</b> from <b>Kermes</b> vermilio.|$|E
2500|$|Porphyrophora hamelii {{is one of}} {{the ancient}} natural sources of red dye in the Middle East and Europe, along with the insect dyes <b>kermes</b> (from <b>Kermes</b> vermilio and related species), lac (from Kerria lacca and related species), and carmine from other Porphyrophora species such as the Polish {{cochineal}} (Porphyrophora polonica), and the plant dye madder (from Rubia tinctorum and related species). [...] It is possible that Armenian cochineal dye was in use as early as 714 B.C., when the Neo-Assyrian king Sargon II was recorded as seizing red textiles as spoils of war from the kingdoms of Urartu (the geographic predecessor of Armenia) and Kilhu. [...] The Roman-era physician and pharmacologist Dioscorides, writing in the 1st century A.D., noted that the best kokkos baphike, the <b>kermes</b> shrub and its [...] "grain" [...] (<b>kermes</b> insect) that some ancient writers likely confused with Porphyrophora hamelii, came from Galatia and Armenia. [...] In the Early Middle Ages the Armenian historians Ghazar Parpetsi and Movses Khorenatsi wrote specifically of a worm-produced dyestuff from the Ararat region.|$|E
2500|$|Monte Urpinu Park, {{the most}} wooded, {{is a low}} hill covered by a pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) and {{evergreen}} oak (Quercus ilex L.) forest with a dense Mediterranean maquis of mastic (Pistacia lentiscus L.), juniper (Juniperus phoenicea L.), <b>Kermes</b> oak (Quercus coccifera L.), wild olive (Olea europaea L. ssp. europaea, var. sylvestris) and tree spurge (Euphorbia dendroides L.). It extends for about [...]|$|E
2500|$|Cochineal is {{probably}} [...] See also the related word <b>kermes</b> {{which is the}} source of a similar but weaker Mediterranean dye also called crimson, which was used to color cloth red before discovery of cochineal in the New World. Some sources identify the Spanish source word for cochineal as cochinilla [...] "wood louse" [...] (a diminutive form of Spanish cochino, cognate with French cochon, meaning [...] "pig")." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{painting}} {{underwent a}} thorough cleaning and restoration in the National Gallery shortly before 1979. The scientists of the Gallery also investigated {{the technical aspects}} of the painting and the painting materials used by Tintoretto. [...] Main pigments in this painting are ultramarine, red lakes (<b>kermes,</b> madder and lac), malachite and azurite. Tintoretto also used the rare arsenic sulfide pigments realgar and orpiment. An illustrated pigment analysis can be found at ColourLex.|$|E
2500|$|Alon Shvut, literally, [...] "oak of return", is a {{reference}} to the return of the Jews expelled from Gush Etzion by the Jordanian Arab Legion in 1948 following the Kfar Etzion massacre. The 700-year-old <b>Kermes</b> Oak (Quercus calliprinos) is sacred to the Arabs with the name Ballutet el Yerzeh (oak of Yerzeh). It was a central feature of Gush Etzion and became known as [...] "lone oak". The town was constructed adjacent to the oak, which is considered a symbol of renewal and continuity. The oak is incorporated in the municipal emblem.|$|E
2500|$|The {{origins of}} the trend for somber colors are elusive, but are {{generally}} attributed to the growing influence of Spain and possibly the importation of Spanish merino wools. [...] The Low Countries, German states, Scandinavia, England, France, and Italy all absorbed the sobering and formal influence of Spanish dress after the mid-1520s. Fine textiles could be dyed [...] "in the grain" [...] (with the expensive <b>kermes),</b> alone or as an over-dye with woad, to produce a wide range colors from blacks and grays through browns, murreys, purples, and sanguines. Inexpensive reds, oranges and pinks were dyed with madder and blues with woad, while a variety of common plants produced yellow dyes, although most were prone to fading.|$|E
2500|$|The {{production}} of Murex purple for the Byzantine court {{came to an}} abrupt end with the sack of Constantinople in 1204, the critical episode of the Fourth Crusade. David Jacoby concludes that [...] "no Byzantine emperor nor any Latin ruler in former Byzantine territories could muster the financial resources required for the pursuit of murex purple production. On the other hand, murex fishing and dyeing with genuine purple are attested for Egypt in the tenth to 13th centuries." [...] By contrast, Jacoby finds that there are no mentions of purple fishing or dyeing, nor trade in the colorant in any Western source, even in the Frankish Levant. The European West turned instead to vermilion provided by the insect <b>Kermes</b> vermilio, known as grana, or crimson.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reserve is}} also home to 24 tree species, of which some are found in Europe and the Mediterranean area as well as in Lebanon. The reserve is known for its official's efforts to save the cedar of Lebanon through {{continues}} management of the forests and planting new trees in previously logged and deforestated areas. The reserve form the last natural limits to the spread of Cedrus libani on the planet. The reserve is also known for the ability of the forests to regenerate by their own without any human interference. Other tree species in the reserve include : Cyprus oak (Quercus infectoria [...] ), Brant’s oak (Quercus brantii), <b>kermes</b> oak (Quercus calliprinos), Calabrian pine (Pinus brutia), Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis), stone pine (Pinus pinea), Greek juniper (Juniperus excelca), Syrian juniper (Arceuthos drupacea).|$|E
2500|$|Red pigment {{made from}} ochre {{was one of}} the first colors used in prehistoric art. The Ancient Egytians and Mayans colored their faces red in ceremonies; Roman generals had their bodies colored red to {{celebrate}} victories. [...] It was also an important color in China, where it was used to color early pottery and later the gates and walls of palaces. [...] In the Renaissance, the brilliant red costumes for the nobility and wealthy were dyed with <b>kermes</b> and cochineal. [...] The 19th century brought the introduction of the first synthetic red dyes, which replaced the traditional dyes. [...] Red also became the color of revolution; [...] Soviet Russia adopted a red flag following the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917, later followed by China, Vietnam, and other communist countries.|$|E
2500|$|If one ignores, for the moment, the {{influence}} of the mountains, the typical Mediterranean peninsular forest is made up of evergreen trees: oak forests, cork oaks, wild olives, juniper, and so on. These are accompanied or replaced in the warmer regions and eroded by forests of Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis) and in areas of sandy ground and fixed sand dunes by juniper [...] and stone pine forests. Exceptions to the rule are the more arid region in the southeast, the lower regions of the provinces of Murcia and Almeria, where the only vegetation is the European fan palm (Chamaerops humilis), and thorny thickets of blackthorn and at higher altitudes, <b>Kermes</b> oak groves and mastic (Pistacia lentiscus). The same can be said of the salty or endorheic zones, with great differences in temperature, such as the depression of the Ebro, Hoya de Baza and the chalky marls further inland.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of the Renaissance in Europe, Porphyrophora insects were so {{valuable}} that in Constantinople during the 1430s, [...] of Porphyrophora hamelii insects was worth more than [...] of gold. [...] The crimson Porphyrophora-based dyes were especially prized in Europe for dyeing silk, as the scarlet dye <b>kermes</b> was more plentiful, cheaper, and more effective for dyeing woolen textiles, which are heavier than silk and require more dye. [...] It has been estimated that on the order of a half million dried Porphyrophora hamelii insects were required to dye [...] of silk crimson during this period. [...] On the comparison between Armenian and Polish cochineal, the author of a 15th-century treatise on silks in Florence wrote that [...] "two pounds of the large Armenian cochineal insects will dye as much silk as one pound of small Polish cochineal insects; it is true that it gives a more noble and brighter colour than the small, but it gives less dye." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the Middle Ages the Armenian {{cochineal}} dyestuff vordan karmir, {{also known}} in Persia as kirmiz, was widely {{celebrated in the}} Near East. [...] Kirmiz {{is not to be}} confused with dyer's <b>kermes,</b> which was derived from another insect. [...] The Armenian cities Artashat and Dvin were early centers of the production of kirmiz: [...] during the 8th through 10th centuries Arab and Persian historians even referred to Artashat as [...] "the town of kirmiz". [...] The Arabs and Persians regarded kirmiz as one of the most valuable commodities exported from Armenia. [...] The Armenians themselves used vordan karmir to produce dyes for textiles (including oriental rugs) and pigments for illuminated manuscripts and church frescos. [...] Chemical analyses have identified the dye of Porphyrophora hamelii in Coptic textiles of the 3rd through 10th centuries, a cashmere cloth used in a kaftan from Sassanid Persia in the 6th or 7th century, silk liturgical gloves from 15th-century France, Ottoman fabrics such as velvets and lampas of the 15th through 17th centuries, and a 16th-century velvet cap of maintenance that belonged to Henry VIII of England.|$|E
2500|$|The {{temperate}} climate and humidity resulting from {{proximity to the}} coast favour {{the growth of a}} rich mat of forest includong Atlantic and Mediterranean species, marking the transition in Portugal from northern to southern vegetation. The Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) predominates over great expanses of the rocky heights and sheltered slopes. On moist shady slopes, normally facing north, or in sheltered places, the common oak (Quercus robur) is widespread. In lowland areas and warm places the Cork oak (Quercus suber) is common and in limestone areas the Portuguese oak (Quercus faginea) is found. Other species scattered throughout the mountains of Sintra include: maple (Acer pseudoplatanus), common hazel (Corylus avellana), common hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), European holly (Ilex aquifolium), Portuguese laurel (Prunus lusitanica), Bay laurel (Laurus nobilis), [...] Strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo), Laurestine (Viburnum tinus), <b>Kermes</b> oak (Quercus coccifera), and Italian buckthorn (Rhamnus alaternus).

60|$|Yesterday evening Mr. William Morris {{delivered}} a most interesting and fascinating lecture on Carpet and Tapestry Weaving at the Arts and Crafts Exhibition now {{held at the}} New Gallery. Mr. Morris had small practical models of the two looms used, the carpet loom where the weaver {{sits in front of}} his work; the more elaborate tapestry loom where the weaver sits behind, {{at the back of the}} stuff, has his design outlined on the upright threads and sees in a mirror the shadow of the pattern and picture as it grows gradually to perfection. He spoke at much length on the question of dyes--praising madder and <b>kermes</b> for reds, precipitate of iron or ochre for yellows, and for blue either indigo or woad. At the back of the platform hung a lovely Flemish tapestry of the fourteenth century, and a superb Persian carpet about two hundred and fifty years old. Mr. Morris pointed out the loveliness of the carpet--its delicate suggestion of hawthorn blossom, iris and rose, its rejection of imitation and shading; and showed how it combined the great quality of decorative design--being at once clear and well defined in form: each outline exquisitely traced, each line deliberate in its intention and its beauty, and the whole effect being one of unity, of harmony, almost of mystery, the colours being so perfectly harmonised together and the little bright notes of colour being so cunningly placed either for tone or brilliancy.|$|E
