40|$|Direct {{government}} aid and fiscal incentives {{for research and}} development each have distinctive advantages and disadvantages. An appropriate mix adjusted to prevailing conditions may increase the efficiency of the system of {{government aid}}. As a matter of fact, the majority of OECD countries provides support to R&D both through direct subsidies and, increasingly, by means of tax incentives. At present the EU is paying greater attention to fiscal incentives for R&D than in the past. For a considerable period of time, Austria has been offering an instrument of <b>fiscal</b> <b>aid</b> to R&D – the R&D tax allowance – which is rather generous by international standards. In its present form, however, the R&D tax allowance shows some weak points. A reform of <b>fiscal</b> <b>aid</b> for R&D, presently in the stage of a draft amendment of the income tax law, is designed to eliminate some of these weaknesses by additional measures (a new R&D tax allowance for R&D expenditure based on the OECD definition, an R&D premium for firms that do not manage to make sufficient profit). This reform of tax incentives for R&D does not leave any firm worse off than before. On the other hand, however, it means that the set of instruments is becoming increasingly complex, and that in turn the costs of administration and compliance by firms tend to increase. Moreover, for the purpose of marketing Austria as a good business location, an easily understandable design of tax incentives would be preferable. Up to now the actual use and effects of the R&D tax allowance have not been very transparent and no evaluation has been presented so far. Therefore, it is recommended to increase the transparency of <b>fiscal</b> <b>aid</b> for R&D and to evaluate the newly designed set of instruments according to international standards after they have been in use for three years.

The main issue here is how to determine the borderline between fiscal autonomy and state aid control of regional tax regimes. Second, the author addresses the recovery of <b>fiscal</b> state <b>aid.</b> Under EU rules, tax incentives granted in violation of EU state aid provisions should normally be recovered from taxpayers except for special circumstances. Both the issue of fiscal autonomy and recovery of state aid have first been addressed by the author in his PhD Thesis 'Assessment and Recovery of Tax Incentives in the EC and the WTO: a View on State Aids, Trade Subsidies and Direct Taxation' (Intersentia Publishers, 2003).

30|$|Fourth, the {{interactive}} mechanism between fiscal poverty alleviation and internet financial poverty alleviation should be actively explored. Up to now, {{the government has}} actually inputted {{a large amount of}} money in poverty reduction. However, this money appeared to be a one-way flow in the form of one-time <b>fiscal</b> <b>aid.</b> In fact, it seems that government fund has been going alone in poverty alleviation. We suggest that fiscal funds for poverty aid be combined with Internet finance so as to further improve the performance of fiscal funds in poverty alleviation. For example, the fiscal fund for poverty alleviation {{can be used as a}} reserve fund, once the Internet financial fund bears a loss, it can be partly compensated from the reserve fund. It is also possible to form a structured loan with fiscal funds and Internet financial fund. In such a structured loan, fiscal fund can be defined as inferior. For example, in a loan portfolio worth of 1 million yuan, 800, 000 yuan is raised from Internet finance, and 200, 000 yuan is from the fiscal fund. When the repayment amount is less than 800, 000 yuan, it will be repaid back to investors of Internet finance. Only when the repayment amount is larger than 800, 000 and that and investors be fully repaid can the fiscal funds be recovered. In this way, fiscal fund can be made more effective in poverty alleviation; besides, it can attract and employ more social capital for the purpose of poverty alleviation.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{public sector}} {{is not the}} only one that creates more and better jobs in {{developed}} countries. In addition, the private sector seems to have a major role in solving the problem of unemployment. But according to recent studies, the oldest and largest private companies cannot seem to provide new opportunities to combat unemployment. This poses a question: which type of companies can provide employment to those individuals seeking it? Lately, it seems that only companies which use advanced technology and startup companies can provide new jobs to those seeking employment. Currently, the mission of the university as an institution has changed. Education of entrepreneurship is the one of the important areas of study in universities all around the world. Developments on information and technology have reached a high level, creating new challenges and problems for universities. Additionally, universities have to change their teaching models and methods to reach contemporary levels. It is possible for universities to revise their missions and visions. These missions should include objectives of education and a suitable strategy that considers the private sector and its expectations from universities. Collaboration with industry and other related sectors can support universities, and encourage them to add courses like “Entrepreneurship” to their curricula. In addition, this encourages universities looking for new partnerships. One such partnership is called KOSGEB (in Turkish), which is a state owned “Small and Medium Enterprises Development Organization”. KOSGEB can provide <b>fiscal</b> <b>aid,</b> some refundable and some not, to all small and medium enterprises. KOSGEB also provide huge opportunities to potential entrepreneurs who want to establish a new business through its Entrepreneur Support Program. One component of the program is to provide monetary support – up to 100, 000 TRL in total. In this study, we will discuss the Entrepreneur Support Program of KOSGEB, and whether it is feasible for solving the problem of unemployment after university education. We ask if this program is a good collaboration to help students, and how universities can apply this support program to their academic program...|$|E

40|$|There is {{some debate}} {{regarding}} whether aid to poor recipients {{should be given}} {{in the form of}} loans or grants. This paper concentrates on whether the form of aid influences the effects on recipient fiscal behaviour. The main part of this paper investigates the recipient tax revenue response to inflows of aid and whether the composition of aid, i. e. loans or grants, induces a significantly different response. The relationship between aid and tax revenue is investigated for a sample of up to 55 low and middle-income countries over the period 1975 - 2000. The results indicate that there is no consistent and robust relationship between aid, the composition of aid, and the tax to GDP ratio in developing countries. This cross-country analysis is complemented by a time series study for 1964 - 2002 of the effect of fiscal variables (government expenditure and revenue) and aid on growth in Kenya. Two measures of aid are used; external grants and loans, and both yield different results. Aid loans are found to {{have a negative impact on}} long run growth, while grants have a positive, albeit weak, impact on growth.

Particular {{attention is paid to}} data quality and the severe difficulties in achieving a reliable disaggregation of aid into its on-budget and off-budget components. The first essay assesses the sensitivity of estimated health aid fungibility to how the missing data (often considerable) are treated and explores a novel (at least in economics) method of multiple imputation. The second essay provides a conceptual framework for the disaggregation of (sector) aid into its on-budget and off-budget components. Given that complete binary distinction is not feasible, the aid-spending relationship is explored from a broader fiscal effects angle. This yields new insights on assessing the effect of health aid on health spending. Contributing to the growing body of evidence based on time-series methods, two essays adopt a case study approach to analyse distinct fiscal dynamics in Tanzania and Ethiopia, invoking detailed understanding of qualitative economic and political context to complement the quantitative data. Both essays employ current Cointegrated Vector Auto-Regressive (CVAR) techniques to distinguish long run equilibrium relationships from short term adjustment mechanisms, test for variable exogeneity and identify which variables adjust to disequilibrium. The fifth and final essay addresses the differences between donor and recipient data records for the two countries, demonstrating that the direction of the discrepancies is not necessarily predicted from the outset and affects the estimated fiscal effects of (and on) aid.
