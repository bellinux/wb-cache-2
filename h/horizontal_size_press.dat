One technique for measuring enclosure is the mathematical construct of an isovist. An isovist is the set of points visible from a location. This paper reports analyses of 15 521 environments, ranging from cabin configurations in space stations to site plans for cities. Although results have been reported for twenty-five variables, it appears that only a few would be sufficient to distinguish between isovists. The most plausible variables are <b>horizontal</b> <b>size</b> and concavity. Judged enclosure was most strongly related to <b>horizontal</b> <b>size,</b> but it was also correlated with the variation in distance from the observation point to the isovist boundary, with boundary predictability, and with concavity.

40|$|To model discriminative, i. e. {{competition}} induced, self-thinning in {{even-aged forest}} stands a concept has been explored that discriminative mortality alters spatial arrangement of trees {{which in turn}} alters the mortality.

40|$|The {{ionosphere}} above Scandinavia in December 2006 is successfully imaged by 4 -dimensional tomography {{using the}} software package MIDAS from the University of Bath. The method concentrates on medium-scale structures: between 100 km and 2000 km in <b>horizontal</b> <b>size.</b> The input consists of TEC measurements from the dense GPS network Geotrim in Finland. In {{order to ensure}} sufficient vertical resolution of the result, EISCAT incoherent scatter radar data from Tromsø are used as additional input to provide the vertical profile information. The TEC offset of the measurements is unknown, but the inversion procedure is able to determine this automatically. This auto-calibration is shown to work well. Comparisons with EISCAT radar results and with occultation {{results show that the}} inversion using EISCAT data for profile information is much better able to resolve vertical profiles of irregular structures than the inversion using built-in profiles. Still, with either method the intensities of irregular structures of sizes near the resolution (about 100 km <b>horizontal</b> <b>size)</b> can be underestimated. Also, the accuracy of the inversion worsens above areas where no receivers are available.

40|$|International audienceGent and McWilliams have {{identified}} the mechanism of internal barotropic instability for axisymmetric vortices which are purely barotropic, but are immersed in a stratified environment. The energy source is the kinetic energy of the barotropic vortex, which can be converted into baroclinic energy by growing oscillations of finite vertical scale. This occurs when the eddy is too tall and thin. The present paper deals with the generalized instability problem of surface-intensified eddies, presenting a complex vertical structure. We first consider the class of eddies whose <b>horizontal</b> <b>size</b> is either close to (or smaller than) the first radius of deformation. On an f-plane, such eddies are more stable than their purely barotropic counterpart to internal barotropic instability, {{all the more so}} that they are fat. This result, which is fond through the identification of the linearly unstable normal modes, is also confirmed through direct numerical simulations. The β-effect acts asymmetrically with regard to internal barotropic instability between purely barotropic and surface-intensified eddies: it stabilizes purely barotropic vortices, wile it enhances the instability of surface-intensified ones. Nonlinear destabilization of vortices can also occur when they undergo finite-amplitude perturbations, for instance, through their interaction with other structures. The Tourbillon eddy is shown to be weakly unstable to linear barotropic instability, but can be destabilized nonlinearly by finite-amplitude perturbations. Finally, eddies whose <b>horizontal</b> <b>size</b> is at least twice as large as the radius of deformation are shown to be primarily unstable to baroclinic instability...|$|R
40|$|It was {{recently}} shown (Masciadri et al. 2000, Masciadri 2001 a), using a numerical simulation (Meso-Nh model), that {{the hypothesis of}} considering horizontally uniform C N can have severe consequences. For example, {{the integration of the}} C N along lines of sight different from the zenith gives variations that can be larger than 0. 50. In this paper we try to validate this result following two approaches. (a) numerical approach: we compare measured and simulated C N profiles. The first ones were obtained with a Generalized Scidar (GS) and the latter are simulated with the Meso-Nh model at the same azimuth and elevation as those of the observations. Further measurements (DIMM, mast and balloons) are considered in order to support the comparison. (b) experimental approach: we compare C N profiles measured (almost simultaneously) by a GS along different lines of sight. The results of this study show that (1) the <b>horizontal</b> <b>size</b> of the turbulent layers can be finite, (2) the simulations and the measurements are well correlated and (3) for the first time, we show that the model can reproduce observed seeing values that vary as much as 0. 50 during the same night. This definitely shows that the numerical simulations are a useful tool {{in the context of the}} turbulence characterization for astronomical applications. Finally, we discuss the implications that a finite <b>horizontal</b> <b>size</b> of the turbulent layers could have on the new adaptive optics techniques, particularly in applications to the extremely large size telescopes...|$|R
