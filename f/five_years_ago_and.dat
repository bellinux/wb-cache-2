Most political observers noted the public's increasing distrust in politicians and the political system as the main reason for the low turnout.|$|E
25|$|Nowadays {{they are}} a rare sight in Japanese cities, and only 30-35 {{professional}} chindon'ya (puro no chindon'ya) still exist, mostly in and around Tokyo, with another 30 amateur and hobby chindon'ya (shirōto chindon'ya) performing at festivals. In recent years, however, {{there seems to be}} a very small increase again, as they can draw on their historic roots to evoke nostalgia. The social status of the performers has also improved. Thus, while far away from their golden days, chindon'ya hold a small niche in the advertising business in Japan. In Osaka, for example, Chindon Tsūshinsha (ちんどん通信社) performs for clothing stores, politicians, beauty salons, and restaurants, in addition to stage performances on weddings, company parties, and other events. They expand their traditional roles even further and even provide a sort of religious services based on old folk rituals, even though they are not in any way priests. They have also performed outside Japan. Another group Adachi in Fukuoka was formed <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> is still doing a good business, including new attractions as for example playing the saxophone while riding the unicycle, or displaying juggling, and balloon modelling performances.|$|E

500|$|Diarra {{began the}} 2001–02 season {{by making the}} bench {{in several of the}} team's league matches in August and September, but failing to make an appearance. In October 2001, he was dropped back down to the club's reserve team and {{appeared}} in four matches before earning promotion back to the senior team for its 2001 Intercontinental Cup showdown with Argentine club Boca Juniors. Diarra made the bench for the match, but did not feature as Bayern won the match courtesy of an extra time goal from Samuel Kuffour. The victory gave Diarra his first major honour of his career. Afterwards, he returned to the reserve team and later suffered an injury, which required a lengthy absence. Diarra rejoined the team in March 2002 under new manager Hermann Gerland and made nine more appearances. Following the season, Diarra was offered a new three-year contract with the club, but rejected it citing his limited playing time. Despite his disappointing stint with Bayern, which included failing to make an appearance with the club's senior team, in 2009, Diarra stated [...] "I have very fond memories of my time in Bayern". Following Diarra's success at Bordeaux, Bayern's general manager Uli Hoeneß admitted that Diarra's rise to prominence as a footballer is [...] "one of the seven wonders of the world". Hoeneß admitted that he was surprised by Diarra's resurgence stating [...] "If somebody had told me [...] <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>and</b> made a bet with me, I would have lost a fortune". Since Diarra departing the club in 2002, due to FIFA compensation laws, Bayern have recouped over €800,000 {{as a result of the}} player's future transfers.|$|E

2500|$|Pollster claimed this {{election}} {{to be much}} closer than <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>and</b> majority of surveys even put Borsellino to lead over Cuffaro. [...] However, Sicily confirmed one {{more time in the}} April 2006 national election, in which the House of Freedoms obtained 57% of regional votes, to be still a centre-right stronghold. The election was in fact characterized by separate contemporary votes for centre-right parties and Rita Borsellino as president, as the sum of centre-right coalition parties obtained over 60% of votes. In any case, the disjoint vote was not sufficient to ensure Borsellino to win the election, and Cuffaro was confirmed president of Sicily.|$|E

Rick Barry had finally rejoined his NBA team from <b>five</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> also, <b>and</b> Clyde Lee starred as well helping Thurmond to a 4-2 series win that wasn't really very close.
