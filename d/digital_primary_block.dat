40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 50 - 56) Historical {{research is}} based on investigations of primary sources. These investigations, however, are almost completely absent in the textbook-based, historysocial science programs for the primary and secondary grades. This is {{in opposition to the}} policy and research literature which both strongly support teaching with primary sources. They indicate that when students study primary sources they can develop important research skills, higher-level thinking skills, and an understanding of the complexity of historical knowledge. The most accessible means for bringing primary source investigations into the classroom is the Internet. It provides access to thousands of digital records of artifacts from institutions around the country and the world. These <b>digital</b> <b>primary</b> sources can be collected by teachers and used to create standards-based investigations of <b>digital</b> <b>primary</b> sources. This paper reviews a website created by the author that provides students with investigations of <b>digital</b> <b>primary</b> sources. These investigations develop students' research and higher-level thinking skills and they provide an experience of the complex process of developing historical understanding. A review of the supporting literature is conducted and implications for the author's teaching are discussed...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a hybrid-level flash {{translation}} layer (FTL) called RNFTL (Reuse-Aware NFTL) {{to improve the}} endurance and space utilization of NAND flash memory. Our basic idea is to prevent a <b>primary</b> <b>block</b> with many free pages from being erased in a merge operation. The preserved <b>primary</b> <b>blocks</b> are further reused as replacement blocks. In such a way, the space utilization {{and the number of}} erase counts for each block in NAND flash can be enhanced. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ a reuse-aware strategy in FTL for improving the space utilization and endurance of NAND flash. We conduct experiments on a set of traces that collected from real workload in daily life. The experimental results show that our technique has significant improvement on space utilization, block lifetime and wear-leveling compared with the previous work.
