5|$|Isopogon anethifolius, {{commonly}} known as narrowleaf- or narrow-leafed <b>drumsticks,</b> is a shrub in the family Proteaceae. The species is found only in coastal areas near Sydney, Australia, and to the immediate west. It occurs naturally in woodland, open forest and heathland on sandstone soils. An upright shrub, it can reach to 3m (10ft) in height, with terete leaves that are divided and narrow. The yellow flowers appear from September to December and are prominently displayed. They are followed by round grey cones, which give the plant its common name of <b>drumsticks.</b> The small hairy seeds {{are found in the}} old flower parts.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} moment, when the <b>drumstick</b> hits the {{membrane}} of a drum. Experiments {{were conducted to}} obtain information about the interaction of drummer, <b>drumstick</b> and membrane during a single stroke. Using a modified <b>drumstick,</b> the force on the <b>drumstick,</b> the acceleration of the stick’s tip, {{the duration of the}} contact between stick and membrane {{and the sound of the}} drum were recorded. Strokes were performed at different dynamic levels, at different positions on the drumhead and for different drumhead tensions. Furthermore, possible influences of the <b>drumstick</b> model and the drummer were analyzed briefly. During the 3 – 6 ms of contact between <b>drumstick</b> and membrane, the interaction process was found to be influenced by the deflection of the drumhead, the vibration of the <b>drumstick</b> and a traveling wave on the drumhead. Altering the different parameters of the experiment, provided an insight into the influence of each interacting component on the process of striking the drum. iv Acknowledgment...|$|R
5|$|Traditionally, Aboriginal peoples {{used the}} {{materials}} at hand {{to make their}} instruments for centuries before Europeans immigrated to Canada. First Nations people made gourds and animal horns into rattles, which were elaborately carved and brightly painted. In woodland areas, they made horns of birch bark and <b>drumsticks</b> of carved antlers and wood. Traditional percussion instruments such as drums were generally made of carved wood and animal hides. These musical instruments provide the background for songs, and songs the background for dances. Traditional First Nations people consider song and dance to be sacred. For years after Europeans came to Canada, First Nations people were forbidden to practice their ceremonies.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the antimicrobial activity and phytochemical screening of <b>Drumstick</b> (Moringa oleifera) leaves extracts. Four solvents were used for extraction. Those were Ethanol, Methanol, Diethyl ether and Acetone. The solvent extraction was done by using Soxlet apparatus. Test microorganisms were screened to confirm their viability and identities using standard microbiological methods. The different solvent extracts of <b>Drumstick</b> leaves was tested for antimicrobial activity using the standard agar well diffusion method against nine enteric pathogens, these are E. coli, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi A, Salmonella paratyphi B, Shigella sonnei, Shigella dysentarie, Enterobactor spp., Citrobactor spp. and Klebsiella spp. The Ethanol extract of <b>Drumstick</b> leaves showed highest antimicrobial activity against Sal. typhi. The Methanol extract of <b>Drumstick</b> leaves showed highest antimicrobial activity against Citrobactor spp. The Diethyl ether extract of <b>Drumstick</b> leaves showed highest antimicrobial activity against Shigella dysentarie while Acetone extract of <b>Drumstick</b> leaves showed highest antimicrobial activity against E. coli. The antimicrobial activity of standard antibiotics Ampicillin and Tetracycline were studied in comparison with <b>Drumstick</b> leaves solvent extracts. The MIC values were determined by both agar and broth dilution method. The functional chemical group was determined by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The phytochemical analysis of <b>Drumstick</b> leaves solvent extracts showed presence o...|$|R

40|$|We motivate {{and discuss}} {{the design of a}} {{physically}} intu-itive haptic <b>drumstick.</b> A new musical instrument is phys-ically intuitive if the physics of haptic interaction are simi-lar to those supported by a traditional musical instrument. We suggest that physically intuitive new musical instru-ments may help performers transfer motor skills from fa-miliar, traditional musical instruments. Both actively con-trolled acoustic instruments and many haptic instruments are physically intuitive. We design a physically intuitive haptic <b>drumstick.</b> Simple models of <b>drumstick</b> dynam-ics and drumstick/membrane collisions are explained and implemented on a high-resolution haptic device. Next, we create a new musical instrument by altering the hap-tic <b>drumstick</b> dynamics in a physically intuitive manner. We focus on drum rolls. In particular, we alter the haptic <b>drumstick</b> dynamics to assist performers in playing single-handed drum rolls. Finally, we analyze the stability of the altered system dynamics using a Poincare ́ map. 1...|$|R

25|$|Drummers use {{a variety}} of {{accessories}} when practicing. Metronomes and beat counters are used to develop a sense of a steady pulse. Drum muffling pads may be used to lessen the volume of drums during practicing. A practice pad, held on the lap, on a leg, or mounted on a stand, is used for near-silent practice with <b>drumsticks.</b> A set of practice pads mounted to simulate an entire drum kit is known as a practice kit. In the 2010s, these have largely been superseded by electronic drums, which can be listened to with headphones for quiet practice and kits with non-sounding mesh heads.|$|E
