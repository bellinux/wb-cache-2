40|$|The {{characteristics}} of energetical {{distribution in the}} <b>equisignal</b> <b>zone</b> have been investigated; the methods for energetical design of the optic system have been developed; the software have been implemented. The principles of constructing optoelectronic systems for simultaneous inspection of two interperpendicular displacements have been proposed, the optic and electric circuits have been developed, the procedures decreasing {{the influence of the}} air path on the system accuracy have been proposed. The methods and computation program on the personal computer have been introducedAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
50|$|The {{key to the}} Sonne {{system was}} a further {{modification}} of the signal before it reached the antennas. A phase shifter was used to retard the signal by 90 degrees when it was sent {{to one of the}} side antennas, or advance it 90 from the other. This created a series of spikes, or lobes, within the cardioid radiation pattern, each about 7.5 degrees wide. As the antennas were physically separated, the spikes did not precisely overlap, producing the dots, dashes and <b>equisignal</b> <b>zones</b> of the Lorenz system.|$|R
