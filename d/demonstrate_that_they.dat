5|$|Lewis {{argues that}} Applewhite {{effectively}} controlled his followers by packaging his teachings in familiar terms. Richard Hecht of the University of California, Santa Barbara, echoes this sentiment, arguing {{that members of}} the group killed themselves because they believed the narrative that he had constructed, rather than because he psychologically controlled them. In his 2000 study of apocalyptic movements, John R. Hall posits that they were motivated to commit suicide because they saw {{it as a way to}} <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had conquered the fear of death and truly believed Applewhite.|$|E
5|$|Only two {{of these}} bodies, Ceres and Pluto, have been {{observed}} in enough detail to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> actually fit the IAU's definition. The IAU accepted Eris as a dwarf planet {{because it is more}} massive than Pluto. They subsequently decided that unnamed trans-Neptunian objects with an absolute magnitude brighter than +1 (and hence a diameter of ≥838km assuming a geometric albedo of ≤1) are to be named under the assumption that they are dwarf planets.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{was known}} for {{fostering}} {{the development of new}} writers without worrying about maximizing profits, and for printing works on principle, even if he knew they would make little money. His risky publication of Joel Barlow's Advice to the Privileged Orders (1792), for example, sold 600 copies and barely broke even. He was also instrumental {{in the creation of the}} female professional writer, a role that began opening to women only at the end of the 18th century in Britain. By nurturing the writings of Anna Laetitia Barbauld, Charlotte Smith, Mary Hays, Mary Wollstonecraft, and Maria Edgeworth, he gave women the opportunity to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could be both successful and significant authors. Additionally, he published works promoting women's equality, such as Hays's An Appeal to the Men of Great Britain (1798), which called for an end to the tyrannical rule of men over women; Johnson's Analytical Review reviewed the work extensively and approvingly.|$|E

25|$|One theory {{goes further}} and {{suggests}} that some special hand-axes were made and displayed by males in search of mate, using a large, well-made hand-axe to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> possessed sufficient strength and skill {{to pass on to}} their offspring. Once they had attracted a female at a group gathering, it is suggested that they would discard their axes, perhaps explaining why so many are found together.|$|E
25|$|During Asmodelle's dance career she {{traveled}} to Asian countries and faced many legal difficulties, especially in Singapore {{where she was}} detained, because her passport denoted an M (for male). She suffered serious problems with various customs officials and became determined to change the laws in Australia. Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade policy was to issue passports bearing the gender designation F only to transsexual women who could <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had completed sex reassignment surgery.|$|E
25|$|The {{procedure}} for issuing penalties for speeding under yellow flag conditions in qualifying was changed for 2014. Previously, drivers {{had been forced}} to slow down in the timing sector of the circuit where a yellow flag was being waved. However, after a series of penalties were issued to drivers for speeding in a sector with yellow flags when the incident that triggered the yellow flag took place behind them, the FIA introduced a change to the procedure. Starting in 2014, the circuits were divided into two hundred metre intervals. In the event of a yellow flag, drivers had to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> slowed down in the two hundred metres immediately before and after the yellow flags while they were being displayed, or else incurred a penalty.|$|E

25|$|Canadian New Democratic Party (NDP) MP Fin Donnelly {{told the}} media that he had hand-delivered their file to Citizenship and Immigration Minister Chris Alexander earlier this year, but the {{application}} was rejected in June 2015 because it was incomplete. The Kurdi family tried to obtain entry to Canada under a private sponsorship program whereby groups of five people may also sponsor an individual or family. They are required to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> can provide roughly 27,000 Canadian dollars to support {{a family of four}} refugees. According to Alexandra Kotyk, project manager of Lifeline Syria, a refugee settlement group in Toronto, the program requires that people seeking to come to Canada from Turkey first be declared refugees by the Turkish government. She said that was often a difficult or impossible condition to fulfill.|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could move freely within the province, a {{combined}} communist force including a company from the 33rd NVA Regiment, elements of the Viet Cong D440 Provincial Mobile Battalion, the Binh Ba and Ngai Giao Guerrilla Squad and the Chau Duc District Company had occupied Binh Ba {{on the evening of}} 5–6 June 1969. In response, Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) forces were sent from Duc Thanh the following morning. Initial intelligence suggested that a group of about platoon strength had infiltrated the village. Meanwhile, during a separate operation 6 RAR had also been engaged in a heavy contact several kilometres north of the task force base and at 08:00 on 6 June, an Australian Centurion tank and an armoured recovery vehicle moving through Binh Ba to assist 6 RAR were fired upon. A rocket propelled grenade (RPG) struck the Centurion penetrating the turret, and causing damage to the tank and severe injuries to one of the crewman. The district commander subsequently asked 1 ATF for assistance in clearing Binh Ba.|$|E
25|$|The Navy's policy {{requires}} that only positive reinforcement techniques {{be used in}} the training of their animals, and that they be cared for in accordance with accepted standards. The NMMP says it complies strictly with United States Department of Defense requirements and federal laws regarding the proper care of the animals, including the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Animal Welfare Act. The program is listed as an accredited institution by the Association for the Accreditation of Animal Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC), whose voluntary accreditation program requires research programs to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> meet standards of animal care beyond those required by law. As a standard targeted at laboratory animals, this accreditation requires a specific standard of general animal care, but does not set restrictions on the purposes for which the animals are used. The NMMP is also listed {{as a member of the}} Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums. The NMMP protocols for both care and research must be approved by an institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC). The NMMP IACUC includes non-NMMP researchers, veterinarians, and members of the community.|$|E

25|$|Testing allows figure skaters to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have {{achieved}} {{a certain level of}} skating proficiency. Tests progress in increasing difficulty and focus on power, strength, speed, quickness, flow, extension, and edge quality and control. Tests are conducted under the auspices of member clubs and administered during test sessions. Usually, three (3) test judges (the judge panel), of appropriate level, determine the outcome of the tests on a pass / retry basis. Tests up to a certain level may be judged by a single, sufficiently qualified, judge. Some higher level dance tests require judges certified in dance judging to attend. The member club is responsible for reporting the results to U.S. Figure Skating. U.S. Figure appoints test judges at various levels (bronze, silver, and gold) based on trial judging and their judging experience. According to their level, test judges are qualified to determine the outcome of increasingly difficult tests. Test judges are invited by the member club to participate at a given test session. Skaters’ testing levels passed determines at what level they may compete. For qualifying competitions, skaters must pass the free skate test at the level for which they intend to compete. U.S. Figure Skating still offers tests in compulsory figures, however, this discipline was last competed at a national championship competition in 1999.|$|E
500|$|Book critic Scott Esposito {{pointed out}} that Chinese {{characters}} are incorrectly described as ideograms in Carr's essay, an error that he believed undermined the essay's argument. The myth that Chinese script is ideographic had been effectively debunked in scholar John DeFrancis' 1984 book DeFrancis classifies Chinese as a logosyllabic writing system. Carr acknowledged {{that there was a}} debate over the terminology of 'ideogram', but in a response to Esposito he explained that he had [...] "decided to use the common term" [...] and quoted The Oxford American Dictionary to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> likewise define Chinese characters as instances of ideograms.|$|E
500|$|In 1945, Libby {{moved to}} the University of Chicago where he began his work on {{radiocarbon}} dating. He published a paper in 1946 in which he proposed that the carbon in living matter might include [...] as well as non-radioactive carbon. Libby and several collaborators proceeded to experiment with methane collected from sewage works in Baltimore, and after isotopically enriching their samples {{they were able to}} <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> contained radioactive [...] By contrast, methane created from petroleum showed no radiocarbon activity because of its age. The results were summarized in a paper in Science in 1947, in which the authors commented that their results implied {{it would be possible to}} date materials containing carbon of organic origin.|$|E

500|$|In 1943, Lewis co-wrote Make this Your Canada with F. R. Scott, {{then the}} CCF's National Chairman. [...] The book's main {{argument}} was that national economic planning had proven itself during wartime with the King government's imposition of wage and price controls through the Wartime Prices and Trade Board. [...] Lewis and Scott further argued that its wartime success could translate to peacetime, and that Canada should adopt a mixed economy. [...] They {{also called for}} public ownership of key economic sectors, and for the burden {{to be placed on}} private companies to <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could manage an industry more effectively in the private sector than the government could in the public sector. [...] The book also outlined the history of the CCF up to that time and explained the party's decision-making process. By Canadian standards, the book was popular, and sold over 25,000copies in its first year of publication.|$|E
500|$|After the {{previous}} week's upset loss to Stanford, the Trojans hosted the Arizona Wildcats, led by head coach Mike Stoops, aiming to correct mistakes and <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{were still in}} contention for the Pac-10 title and to remain an outside candidate for the national title game. [...] Matters were complicated {{when it was announced}} that starting quarterback John David Booty would not start due to a broken middle finger on his throwing hand, suffered during {{the previous}} week's loss. [...] As a result, redshirt sophomore Mark Sanchez made his first start for the Trojans; previously he had only played during garbage time. [...] The Trojans also remained without offensive linemen Chilo Rachal and Kris O'Dowd, as well as leading rusher Stafon Johnson, who remained idle for a secondweek after bruising his left foot during the game against Washington. [...] The Trojans entered the game a 21-point favorite.|$|E

A month later, Miliband announced to the House of Commons a change to the government's policy on coal-fired power stations, saying that any potential new coal-fired power stations would be unable to receive government consent unless they could <b>demonstrate</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would be able to effectively capture and bury 25% of the emissions they produce immediately, with a view to seeing that rise to 100% of emissions by 2025.
