500|$|Early {{publicity}} {{for the film}} in 1984 included an announcement that David Bowie would play Zorin.

500|$|To {{simulate}} {{the police officer}} falling in the opening scene, the special effects department had the stunt <b>double</b> <b>fall</b> 52feet onto an 18x24feet airbag, which they referred to as [...] "old-fashioned" [...] because they used the airbag rather than wires. Trevor Jones, the stuntman doing the scene, commented during shooting that his fall had a small margin of error, {{because of the small}} airbag and cement walls surrounding the area, [...] "if you land off center maybe three or four feet, then you're going to get pitched in that direction". To aid Jones, a large X was placed on the airbag. A scene later in the episode involves a car fleeing through a garage door, only to hit a concrete wall, flip over, and burst into flames. To create the scene, the crew used two externally identical cars; one was drivable, and the other was a shell of car, and was hooked to a cable rig. After taking a week to get everything set up, the crew used a nitrogen cannon to launch the second, undrivable car through the garage door via wires.|$|E

40|$|Objective: {{to study}} the blood atherogenic {{potential}} in women with gestosis in early puerperium to assess a risk of cardiovascular diseases. Subjects and methods: The concentrations of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and cholesterols of high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, and very low-density lipoprotein were measured in 32 patients aged 25 — 30 years in early puerperium. The data of examining women with gestoses (Group 3) were compared {{with the results of}} examining those after physiological pregnancy delivered both during vaginal delivery (Group 1) and via cesarean section (Group 2). Results and discussion. The puerperas with gestosis had significant hypertriglyceridemia and hyperbetacholesterolemia throughout the follow-up. There were no significant abnormal concentrations of low-density lipoproteins. In gestosis and after cesarean section, there was an almost <b>double</b> <b>fall</b> in the blood concentration of high-density lipoproteins to the level that assigned these patients to a group at risk for cardiovascular diseases. In these patients, the cholesterol atherogenicity coefficient was drastically increased. A moderate increase in the blood atherogenic potential in early puerperium was noted both during normal pregnancy and at normal labor. Conclusion. Concomitance of hypertriglyceridemia and hyperprebetacholesrerolemia with the low concentration of high-density lipoproteins suggests that after prior gestosis, cardiovascular complications may develop, presenting a high death risk. It is concluded {{that it is necessary to}} monitor the blood lipoprotein spectrum during gestation and puerperium and atherogenic dyslipoproteinemia can be corrected in case of its detection. Key words: gestosis, puerperium, dyslipoproteinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperprebetacholesterolemia...|$|E

500|$|The {{scene where}} Stefani's stunt <b>double</b> <b>falls</b> {{surprised}} critics at first, with many {{thinking that the}} fall was real. Delbyck called the stunt [...] "confusing", but [...] "if you look closely right before the fall, however, Stefani leaves the screen {{for a couple of}} seconds" [...] (allowing her to change before the final scene). Calling the video [...] "colorful", Justin Harp of Digital Spy enjoyed the stunt-double [...] "trickery". The Michigan Daily Kennedy described the video as [...] "a brightly colored beacon of hope for continued experimentation in popular music". According to Erin Jensen of USA Today, it was a response to Stefani's [...] "comment that her life 'blew up' with the demise of her marriage".|$|R

Instead, the stunt team had the <b>doubles</b> <b>fall</b> through the wall without wires, and land on pads below, which stunt coordinator Tanner Gill said ultimately [...] "worked really effectively". For the subsequent fireworks factory explosion, a practical explosion was created by the series effects team, and then CG fireworks were added by Pixomondo. The practical explosion shook all the stages around the ABC Studios lot.|$|R

40|$|An {{ordinary}} permutation can be locally classified {{according to}} the four local types called peaks, valleys, double rises and <b>double</b> <b>falls,</b> {{and there is a}} corresponding classification of binary increasing trees {{according to the}} four node types. Moreover, by the bijection between permutations, binary increasing trees, and suitably defined path diagrams induced by Motzkin paths, one can obtain a continued fraction representation of the ordinary generating function of local types. The aim {{of this article is to}} extend the notion of local types to k-Stirling permutations, establish a relation of these local types with node types of (k + 1) -ary increasing trees, and to obtain a continued fraction type representation of the generating function of these local types through a bijection with suitably defined path diagrams. In the case of the classical Stirling permutations, we give an alternative continued fraction type representation of ordinary generating function, by using the correspondence between Stirling permutations, plane-ordered recursive trees, and a different family of path diagrams...|$|R
50|$|The first {{main event}} of the night was an 8 Team Tag-Team Elimination match for the JCW Tag Team Championship. Early on, Necro Butcher pinned Greg Valentine with a Sunset flip, {{eliminating}} The Original Dream Team. Following a series of tags, Samu and Alofa hit Axl Rotten with a <b>Double</b> <b>falling</b> headbutt for the pin. Quickly after, Tito Santana pinned Samu with a Schoolboy. Later, Damaja hit Zach Gowen with Brain Damage, then Doug Basham landed a Diving headbutt and pinned Gowen, eliminating Pimp & Gimp Connection. After another series of tags, Brute Issei eliminated the team of Tito and Jorge Santana following an STO on Jorge. Issei then agreed to a partnership with The Basham Brothers, but Doug quickly turned on him and landed the Last Impression to eliminate Team All Japan. In the final minutes, Doug attempted a Sunset flip on Mad Man Pondo, but Pondo counted and hit him with the Stop Sign Smash for the victory.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to the {{revamping}} in 2008, {{the games}} {{played for the}} car were similar to the pricing games seen on The Price Is Right, but were based on luck rather than having the contestant guess the actual price of the car. These have included a game with a staircase of buttons {{in any of these}} three colors (red, green, or blue) with the contestant trying to avoid a [...] "broken" [...] button (indicated by an alarm) to win (this game was relaunched in 2005 with a man in a cherry picker, usually a stunt <b>double,</b> <b>falling</b> out of it if the broken button was pushed). A similar version was played in Chile and in some occasions on the Univision version, where Don Francisco uses a pistol and the contestant would lose if the pistol fired. The concept is loosely based on The Price Is Rights [...] "Ten Chances" [...] pricing game, albeit largely unrelated.|$|R
5000|$|... 1966 {{would see}} a big drop in Hall's playing time (from 148 games to 120) as the Twins would more often sit him against tough lefties. Rookie left hander Ted Uhlaender would be given {{significant}} playing time in center as Hall would play all three outfield positions, with {{most of his time}} being in left in place of ailing slugger Allison. With reduced playing time, Hall saw an across-the-board drop in all statistical categories, hitting only [...]239 with 20 home runs, 47 RBI, and 7 <b>doubles</b> (<b>falling</b> off a cliff from 1965's 25 doubles), but would still slug at least 20 home runs for the fourth season in a row. Deciding to employ the light-hitting Uhlaender full-time in center, the Twins traded Hall on December 2 to the Angels along with reliever Pete Cimino and first baseman Don Mincher for starter Dean Chance and a player to be named (which would become infielder Jackie Hernandez on April 10, 1967).|$|R
50|$|In doubles, Vesnina {{along with}} Indian Sania Mirza won the finals of the BNP Paribas Open by {{defeating}} Bethanie Mattek-Sands and Meghann Shaughnessy.

The table that Ripley and King's stunt <b>doubles</b> <b>fall</b> through had its legs weakened, and the glasses on the table were replaced with sugar glass. The Brief Encounter fantasy was filmed at a steam railway near Rochdale. Nigel Cole used the scene as an opportunity to make his mark as a television director. Most of the scene was filmed by Cole and the main crew. Establishing shots were filmed by Langan and the second unit, due to time constraints. The lighting and focus of the fantasy station was intended to be a direct contrast to the harsh modernity of Piccadilly, which appeared in the [...] "real life" [...] scenes.|$|R
40|$|Any {{ordinary}} permutation τ ∈ Sn of size n, {{written as}} a word τ = τ 1 [...] . τn, can be locally classified {{according to the}} relative order of τj to its neighbours. This gives rise to four local order types called peaks (or maxima), valleys (or minima), double rises and <b>double</b> <b>falls.</b> By the correspondence between permutations and binary increasing trees the classification of permutations according to local types corresponds to a classification of binary increasing trees according to nodes types. Moreover, by the bijection between permutations, binary increasing trees and suitably defined path diagrams one can obtain continued fraction representations of the ordinary generating function of local types. The aim of this work is to introduce the notion of local types in k-Stirling permutations, to relate these local types with nodes types in (k + 1) -ary increasing trees and to obtain a bijection with suitably defined path diagrams.
