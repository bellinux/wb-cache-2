A review from 2000 in Empire {{magazine}} called the film [...] "a fabulous fantasy" [...] and wrote, [...] "David Bowie cuts a spooky enough figure in that fright wig to <b>fit</b> <b>right</b> in with this extraordinary menagerie of Goth Muppets. And Jennifer Connelly, {{still in the}} flush of youth, makes for an appealingly together kind of heroine." [...] Writing for the Chicago Tribune in 2007, Michael Wilmington described Labyrinth as [...] "dazzling", writing that it is [...] "a real masterpiece of puppetry and special effects, an absolutely gorgeous children's fantasy movie". In 2010 Total Film ran a feature called 'Why We Love Labyrinth' which described Labyrinth as a [...] "hyper-real, vibrant daydream, Labyrinth's main strength lies in its fairytale roots, which give the fantastical story a platform from which to launch into some deliriously outlandish scenarios".

500|$|Since {{its initial}} reception, the album has been praised by critics for Charles's style and manner of {{interpreting}} country music into his R musical language. Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times {{wrote that the}} [...] "masterful interpretation of several country standards ... opened a lot of pop ears to country music and showed Nashville much about {{the proper use of}} orchestration." [...] Allmusic editor Stephen Cook called the album a [...] "fine store of inimitable interpretations", and stated, [...] "Less modern for its country-R blend and lushly produced C tone than for its place as a high-profile crossover hit, Modern Sounds in Country and Western <b>fit</b> <b>right</b> in with Ray Charles's expansive musical ways while on the Atlantic label in the '50s".

500|$|Vincent Kartheiser, then 23, {{was looking}} for {{something}} more stable than the usual feature movies. He decided to audition after his agent sent him the role and tapes of all previous seasons. The producers wanted the character to be a surprise to audiences, so not even Kartheiser was informed that he was trying out for Angel's son. Instead he auditioned for a character created for the purpose of audition, ‘the Street Kid’, a normal teenager who had Angel as his guardian. [...] "Right away everyone kind of had a good feeling about me joining the cast," [...] Vincent says. [...] "It seemed that I just <b>fit</b> <b>right</b> in." [...] Kartheiser was excited after learning that his real role was 'Angel's son, a demon killer from Quor'toth.’ He was confused about his portrayal, thinking that the character was to have a [...] "living-in-the-brush kind of ‘failed being’ attitude." [...] Instead, he was told to just [...] "stand up straight, [...] normal voice," [...] and let a regular boy come on. Vincent Kartheiser was initially contracted for three episodes with an option to pick him up further.|$|E
500|$|When Windsor {{took over}} the role in 1994, she was unhappy with the way Peggy was being scripted. She has commented, [...] "a few things weren't quite right about Peggy at the beginning. On a purely {{superficial}} level, the wig didn't <b>fit</b> <b>right.</b> And the clothes weren't right either. They appeared too downmarket. I was particularly worried about how the character was viewed by the producer and writers. I saw her as much ballsier than they did. I think they envisioned Peggy as this rather sad, vulnerable lady who spent all her time worrying about her children." [...] However, early in 1995, EastEnders acquired a new executive producer, Corinne Hollingworth, who shared Windsor's vision of Peggy. It was Hollingworth who decided that Peggy would be a central character, the new landlady of The Queen Victoria public house, one of the soap's main focal points. Hollingworth stated that Peggy was [...] "not {{going to be allowed}} to just sit in some flat polishing her nails". Windsor has said: [...] "It was like a dream. [...] let me go out with the costume designer and choose Peggy's wardrobe, which needed {{to be a lot more}} flash and upmarket. Corinne and I worked on getting Peggy right and I finally began to believe...".|$|E

It brings total sex appeal and groove that starts the hips swinging and is so meant to break the set into a dark drive and into sensual exploration of a grind close contact dance rhythm". Rich Lopez of the Dallas Voice cited the song as {{being one of the}} [...] "better" [...] songs of Love? and was surprised it had [...] "yet to be released as a single". Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly complimented the potential of the song by stating that it is [...] "sure to <b>fit</b> <b>right</b> into club DJ mixes and get people dancing"; however, he criticized that Gaga was [...] "all over the song ... as if Lopez went into the booth trying to emulate her delivery." [...] Emily Exton of Popdust agreed, adding that [...] "you'd be silly not to think" [...] that the song's chorus will become a dance-floor chant among [...] "slightly intoxicated females (and males) in bars across America this summer". She additionally wrote that it was [...] "impossible to get [...] out of your head after more than one listen" [...] although becoming [...] "increasingly monotonous over nearly three and half minutes" [...] Digital Spy's Robert Copsey roughly expanded on this view, stating that [...] "Hypnotico" [...] is not anything [...] "we haven't heard before," [...] although elaborating that it is worthy of a standalone release.|$|E
500|$|The Matrix {{commented that}} after they {{presented}} songs to Spears, she tailored them to suit herself, especially the lyrics. Christy said, [...] "... she {{really knows what}} she wants.

[...] Christy also claimed to be impressed with Spears's vocal ability during the recording of [...] "Shadow". Steve Anderson, Lisa Greene and Stephen Lee wrote [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] at Metrophonic Studios in London, England. Before meeting with the other writers, Anderson thought of two concepts for songs specifically for Spears: one he had worked on [...] "for ages", and [...] "Breathe on Me", which he drafted {{on the morning of the}} sessions. Greene and Lee did not like the first concept, and they wrote [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] with Anderson. The song was produced by Mark Taylor, who kept most of the programming done by Anderson. With Taylor, Spears recorded [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] and [...] "And Then We Kiss", which did not make the album. Before the album was released, Spears's manager Larry Rudolph commented that it was important for Spears to continue moving away from a traditional pop sound, citing [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U" [...] and [...] "Boys" [...] from Britney as departures from her previous music. Barry Weiss, then-president of Jive Label Group, added, [...] "She has achieved what she set out to achieve, which was to make a mature album that didn't sound like something she would have done three years while still making a commercial album that has hit singles. [...] It's the kind of record she should be doing right now, and it came down to her to make it." [...] In the Zone was recorded at Battery Studios and The Dojo in New York City, 3:20 Studios, Decoy Studios, Pacifique Studios, Record Plant in Los Angeles, California, Westlake Recording Studios in West Hollywood, California, The Chocolate Factory, in Chicago, Illinois, Triangle Sound Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, Metrophonic Studios and Olympic Studios in London, England, and Murlyn Studios in Stockholm, Sweden.
