5|$|As {{opposed to}} {{previous}} expansion drafts, players {{from both the}} American League (AL) and National League (NL) were available to the expansion clubs. Each existing club could protect 15 players on their 40-man roster from being <b>drafted</b> <b>and</b> only one player could be drafted from each team in each round.

In addition to the Mannings, the camp has included many prominent players from football as coaches, such as Colts wide receivers Marvin Harrison and Reggie Wayne.|$|E

The Massachusetts Constitution was ratified in 1780 while the Revolutionary War was in progress, {{four years after the}} Articles of Confederation was <b>drafted,</b> <b>and</b> eight years before the present United States Constitution was ratified on June 21, 1788. Drafted by John Adams, the Massachusetts Constitution is currently the oldest functioning written constitution in continuous effect in the world.

Allen sprained his ankle in a workout with his hometown Philadelphia 76ers {{and was forced to}} miss the next workout with the New Jersey Nets.

5|$|When {{the title}} was created, a {{suggested}} medal was <b>drafted</b> <b>and</b> designed by the government. The major difference between this medal and the current medal is {{the design of the}} suspension and the star medallion at the bottom: the top suspension is longer than the bottom, and the bottom star is outlined differently and is adorned with rubies. The suspension was made from gold-plated silver, while the suspension of the current medal is made from gold, as the medal. The design of the star evokes the Marshal's Star, which Soviet Marshals wore around their necks. This medal was adopted by Presidential Decree Number 26 on May 15, 1996.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later, the Emperor {{received}} word {{that his father}} had died on 10 March 1826, and that he had succeeded his father on the Portuguese throne as King Dom PedroIV. Aware that a reunion of Brazil and Portugal would be unacceptable to the people of both nations, he hastily abdicated the crown of Portugal on 2 May in favor of his eldest daughter, who became Queen Dona MariaII. His abdication was conditional: Portugal was required to accept the Constitution which he had <b>drafted</b> <b>and</b> MariaII was to marry his brother Miguel. Regardless of the abdication, PedroI continued to act as an absentee king of Portugal and interceded in its diplomatic matters, as well as in internal affairs, such as making appointments. He found it difficult, at the very least, to keep his position as Brazilian emperor separate from his obligations to protect his daughter's interests in Portugal.|$|E
5|$|As the D-League season wound down, Rice {{emerged as}} a sleeper draft choice for the 2013 NBA draft. His {{performances}} ended up helping him go from {{the possibility of being}} undrafted to being taken as early as the late first round. He was one of 60 players invited to the NBA Draft Combine. On June 27, 2013, Rice was selected with the 35th overall pick of the NBA Draft by the Philadelphia 76ers, but was traded to the Washington Wizards for the 38th and 54th selections, {{which turned out to be}} Nate Wolters and Arsalan Kazemi, respectively. He became the fourth player with D-League experience to be <b>drafted</b> <b>and</b> at 35th overall was the highest D-League veteran to have been drafted to that point. However, P. J. Hairston became the first D-League first-rounder when he was drafted 26th in the 2014 NBA draft to eclipse this record.|$|E

5|$|At the {{national}} convention of 1856, Stone presented {{a new strategy}} suggested by Antoinette Brown Blackwell to send a memorial to the various state legislatures signed by the officers of the National Woman’s Rights Convention. Antoinette Brown had married Samuel Charles Blackwell on January 24, 1856, becoming Stone's sister-in-law in the process. Stone, Brown Blackwell and Ernestine Rose were appointed a committee {{to carry out the}} plan. Stone <b>drafted</b> <b>and</b> printed the appeal, and Brown Blackwell mailed it to twenty-five state legislatures. Indiana and Pennsylvania referred the memorial to select committees, while both Massachusetts and Maine granted hearings. On March 6, 1857, Stone, Wendell Phillips and James Freeman Clarke addressed the Judiciary Committee of the Massachusetts senate, and on March 10, Stone and Phillips addressed a select committee of the Maine legislature.|$|E
5|$|Caulfield was {{chairman}} of the committee that drafted the policies, standards and procedures for water resources planning that became known as Senate Document 97, subjecting new federal water projects to benefit/cost analysis for the first time. He was the staff leader in drafting the Water Resources Planning Act of 1965 and was instrumental in its passage through the U.S. Congress; becoming the first Director of the Water Resources Council, a cabinet-level interagency advisory committee created by that Act. From October 1961 to August 1969 he was the leading professional official within the United States government developing and implementing policies for comprehensive river basin planning. In 1968 he <b>drafted</b> <b>and</b> gained political acceptance of a Water Resources Councils' regulation changing the discount rate used in planning water projects from a formula based on the coupon rate of government bonds to one based on the yield rate—a substantial and important policy change. He also had a leading role in early development of the Water Resources Council's Principles and Standards for water project planning promulgated in September 1973.|$|E
5|$|Closer to home, McKinley and Hay {{engaged in}} {{negotiations}} with Britain over the possible construction of a canal across Central America. The Clayton–Bulwer Treaty, which the two nations signed in 1850, prohibited either from establishing exclusive control over a canal there. The war had exposed the difficulty of maintaining a two-ocean navy without a connection closer than Cape Horn. Now, with American business and military interests even more involved in Asia, a canal seemed more essential than ever, and McKinley pressed for a renegotiation of the treaty. Hay and the British ambassador, Julian Pauncefote, agreed that the United States could control a future canal, provided that it was open to all shipping and not fortified. McKinley was satisfied with the terms, but the Senate rejected them, demanding that the United States be allowed to fortify the canal. Hay was embarrassed by the rebuff and offered his resignation, but McKinley refused it and ordered him to continue negotiations to achieve the Senate's demands. He was successful, and a new treaty was <b>drafted</b> <b>and</b> approved, but not before McKinley's assassination in 1901.|$|E

5|$|In 1942, Robinson was <b>drafted</b> <b>and</b> {{assigned}} to a segregated Army cavalry unit in Fort Riley, Kansas. Having the requisite qualifications, Robinson and several other black soldiers applied for admission to an Officer Candidate School (OCS) then located at Fort Riley. Although the Army's initial July 1941 guidelines for OCS had been drafted as race neutral, few black applicants were admitted into OCS until after subsequent directives by Army leadership. As a result, the applications of Robinson and his colleagues were delayed for several months. After protests by heavyweight boxing champion Joe Louis (then stationed at Fort Riley) and the help of Truman Gibson (then an assistant civilian aide to the Secretary of War), the men were accepted into OCS. The experience led to a personal friendship between Robinson and Louis. Upon finishing OCS, Robinson was commissioned as a second lieutenant in January 1943. Shortly afterward, Robinson and Isum were formally engaged.|$|E

Tavares {{has been with the}} team since being <b>drafted</b> <b>and</b> currently serves as their team captain. Only two players, Potvin and Bryan Trottier (1974), have played over 1000 games with the Islanders, though eight others have played at least 1000 games in the NHL. Five draft picks have gone on to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame: Potvin, Clark Gillies (1974), Trottier, Mike Bossy (1977), and Pat LaFontaine (1983). All, except LaFontaine, along with Bob Nystrom (1972) have had their uniform number retired by the team.|$|E
