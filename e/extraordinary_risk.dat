40|$|The problem context. The precautionary {{principle}} (PP) {{has been proposed}} {{as a guide for}} public policy in areas where there may be <b>extraordinary</b> <b>risk,</b> uncertainty, and gross ignorance about future consequences. Of course, we already have theory and methods for risk assessment and risk management, but the whole PP movement is founded on the claim that something more, something stronger than ordinary risk management (ORM), is needed. The PP is fundamentally a claim that, when making multi-dimensional public decisions, acting to avoid and/or mitigate potential harmful consequences should be accorded high priority. It has been invoked in contexts such as medical, pharmaceutical, ecological, and environmental risk; and is a source of controversy in trade and economic development. There are many definitions of the PP in the literature (Clooney 2004). Definitions fall into three main categories, on a weaker-stronger scale: • Uncertainty about harmful consequences does not justify failure to take precautionary action (Bergen Declaration 1990) • Plausible but uncertain harm justifies precautionary intervention (UNESCO 2005) • Uncertain harm requires intervention, and the burden of proof is shifted to the proponent of the proposed risky action (Wingspread Statement) Governments and international organizations have adopted various versions of the PP.

40|$|Viewing the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment {{as a form}} of {{insurance}} appeals to our intuition. The government, like fire, does not often 2 ̆ 2 take 2 ̆ 2 property, but when faced with <b>extraordinary</b> <b>risk</b> property owners naturally desire compensation. Recent scholarship, however, has dissolved the attractiveness of this perspective. This literature, through economic analysis, claims that the Takings Clause should be repealed and replaced with private takings insurance. This is the 2 ̆ 2 no-compensation 2 ̆ 2 result. This article argues that the insurance-based understanding of the just compensation requirement can be preserved without reaching the surprising no-compensation result. The intuitive appeal of understanding the Takings Clause as a form {{of insurance}} is worth preserving, and a compelling constitutional foundation exists for this view. The Takings Clause is a constitutional bargain rooted in economic logic. The no-compensation result rests on an unbalanced and unrealistic view of the relationship between government and property owners, and the Takings Clause makes sense once we realize that the government, as well as property owners, must have incentives tobehave efficiently. Indeed, because of its monopoly over information about possible takings, the government requires special impetus to act optimally. Courts, in contrast to no-compensation scholars, have been sensitive to the need to encourage proper state action...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{findings from}} an epidemiologic field survey of 500 Mexican American farmworkers conducted in central California. The survey {{was intended as}} a health needs assessment of this population and the Health Opinion Survey was used to establish normative psychiatric symptom distributions. Analyses of the data by gender, age and income revealed that these socio-demographic variables were not important predictors of symptom levels, although the highest mean scores were reported in the 40 - 59 age group. Income levels were modest and fairly uniform, which contributed to the lack of mean score variation. Symptom distributions were analyzed for the variables age and sex using the HOS criteria of caseness and it was found that approx. 20 % of the sample reached the criteria of caseness. A comparison of HOS mean scores with a national sample of surveys indicated that Mexican American farmworkers had symptom levels which resemble those of other low income socio-economic groups, such as southern blacks. Another analysis was conducted which reported a striking correspondence between self perception of health with psychiatric symptoms. A conclusion reached from the survey is that the Mexican Ametican farmworkers in this sample appear to be experiencing psychiatric symptom levels which place them at <b>extraordinary</b> <b>risk.</b> Stresses associated with this group, i. e. limited social mobility, transience, poverty, discrimination and a high rate of traumatic life events were identified as possible contributors to this risk proneness. ...|$|E

40|$|AIDS-related CMV {{retinitis}} is {{a common}} clinical problem in patients with advanced HIV/AIDS in China and Southeast Asia. The disease is causing blindness, and current clinical management, commonly characterized by delayed diagnosis and inadequate treatment, results in poor clinical outcomes: 21 % - 36 % of eyes with CMV retinitis are already blind {{at the time the}} diagnosis is first established by an ophthalmologist. CMV retinitis also identifies a group of patients at <b>extraordinary</b> <b>risk</b> of mortality, and the direct or indirect contribution of extraocular CMV disease to AIDS-related morbidity and mortality is currently unmeasured and clinically often overlooked. The obvious way to improve clinical management of CMV retinitis is to screen all patients with CD 4 counts < 100 cells/μL with indirect ophthalmoscopy at the time they first present for care, and to provide systemic treatment with oral valganciclovir when active CMV retinitis is detected. Treatment of opportunistic infections {{is an integral part of}} HIV management, and, with appropriate training and support, CMV retinitis screening and treatment can be managed by the HIV clinicians, like all other opportunistic infections. Access to ophthalmologist has been problematic for HIV patients in China, and although non-ophthalmologists can perform screening, sophisticated ophthalmological skills are required for the management of retinal detachment and immune recovery uveitis, the major complications of CMV retinitis. CMV retinitis has been clinically ignored, in part, because of the perceived complexity and expense of treatment, and this obstacle can be removed by making valganciclovir affordable and widely available. Valganciclovir is an essential drug for developing successful programs for management of CMV retinitis in China and throughout SE Asia...|$|E
40|$|Inaugural lecture [...] Faculty of Law, Rand Afrikaans University, 22 August 1969 The {{development}} of {{the basis of the}} law of delict has centred around the search for a balance between two fundamental human interests, viz. interest in freedom of action and interest in security. Primitive law based liability on causality; hence there was an over-emphasis on the security interest of the individual and group. By a gradual process of development over centuries the emphasis shifted to the interest of freedom. This culminated in the dogmatic axiom of the nineteenth century, viz. no liability without fault. Since {{the latter part of the}} last century there has been a progressive erosion of the fault principle by means of legal fictions and reversal of the onus of proof. The technological revolution of the past seven and more decades has clearly demonstrated the inadequacy of the fault principle as the sole basis of delictual liability. The high risk of injury, the increased extent of damage, the difficulty of proving fault, and the economic success of the industrial revolution have led to the emergence of a new principle, viz. risk or strict liability. In view of the emergence of two apparently conflicting and independent principles of delictual liability, viz. fault and risk, the most fundamental dogmatic problem of the law of delict is the question as to the common basis of delictual liability. It is suggested that the common basis is creation of an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>risk</b> of injury. In the case of fault liability the risk is created by the unreasonable (negligent) conduct of the actor; in the case of strict liability, by the inherently dangerous nature of the reasonable (non-negligent) conduct. Delictual liability, therefore, attaches where damage has been wrongfully caused by the creation of a substantial risk, either through fault (fault liability) or by the inherently hazardous nature of the activity which has a priori been designated as such (risk or strict liability) ...|$|E
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE Prior {{research}} has identified five common genetic variants associated with narcolepsy with cataplexy in Caucasian patients. To replicate and/or extend these findings, we have tested HLA-DQB 1, the previously identified 5 variants, and 10 other potential variants {{in a large}} European sample of narcolepsy with cataplexy subjects. DESIGN Retrospective case-control study. SETTING A recent study showed that over 76 % of significant genome-wide association variants lie within DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs). From our previous GWAS, we identified 30 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with P < 10 (- 4) mapping to DHSs. Ten SNPs tagging these sites, HLADQB 1, and all previously reported SNPs significantly associated with narcolepsy were tested for replication. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS For GWAS, 1, 261 narcolepsy patients and 1, 422 HLA-DQB 1 * 06 : 02 -matched controls were included. For HLA study, 1, 218 patients and 3, 541 controls were included. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS None of the top variants within DHSs were replicated. Out of the five previously reported SNPs, only rs 2858884 within the HLA region (P < 2 x 10 (- 9)) and rs 1154155 within the TRA locus (P < 2 x 10 (- 8)) replicated. DQB 1 typing confirmed that DQB 1 * 06 : 02 confers an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>risk</b> (odds ratio 251). Four protective alleles (DQB 1 * 06 : 03, odds ratio 0. 17, DQB 1 * 05 : 01, odds ratio 0. 56, DQB 1 * 06 : 09 odds ratio 0. 21, DQB 1 * 02 odds ratio 0. 76) were also identified. CONCLUSION An overwhelming portion of genetic risk for narcolepsy with cataplexy is found at DQB 1 locus. Since DQB 1 * 06 : 02 positive subjects are at 251 -fold increase in risk for narcolepsy, and all recent cases of narcolepsy after H 1 N 1 vaccination are positive for this allele, DQB 1 genotyping may be relevant to public health policy...|$|E

40|$|A {{range of}} {{seemingly}} rival theories {{attempt to explain}} why some individuals take <b>extraordinary</b> <b>risks</b> by choosing to participate in armed conflict. To date, however, competing accounts have typically not been grounded in systematic, empirical studies of the determinants of participation. In this article, we begin to fill this gap through {{an examination of the}} determinants of participation in insurgent and counterinsurgent factions in Sierra Leone’s civil war. We find some support for all of the competing theories, suggesting that the rivalry between them is artificial and that theoretical work has insufficiently explored the interaction of various recruitment strategies. At the same time, the empirical results challenge standard interpretations of grievance-based accounts of participation, as poverty, a lack of access to education, and political alienation predict participation in both rebellion and counterrebellion. Factors that are traditionally seen as indicators of grievance or frustration may instead proxy for a more general susceptibility to engage in violent action or a greater vulnerability to political manipulation by elites. Why do some individuals take enormous risksto participate as fighters in civil war? Whatdifferentiates those who are mobilized from those who remain on the sidelines?

40|$|We {{live in a}} time of {{extraordinary}} opportunities but also <b>extraordinary</b> <b>risks.</b> The world’s economies have become more interdependent, linked by global markets in capital and commodities, creating enormous benefits but also systemic risks. Capital flows freely across national boundaries as banks and capital markets have become increasingly international. But failure of the financial system in one economy can be transmitted to other financial institutions as contagion sets hold. As the recent financial crisis has shown, only a concerted global effort across central banks and governments can dampen contagion being transmitted between econo-mies. Likewise, energy trades relatively freely across bor-ders through international shipping, pipelines, and elec-trical grids, creating interdependence but also substantial risk for countries dependent on importing energy. Supplies of fuel are largely concentrated in a few locations in the world with the passages for naval shipments limited to several narrow straits; electrical grids and pipelines cross borders making any one nation vulnerable to the sovereign decisions of others. In addi-tion, we have a planet whose climate is changing rapidly due to anthropogenic activities. Most coastal cities, nearly half of the planet’s species, and the livelihoods of billions of people are under threat from climate change.

Thus, {{it is important to}} identify, analyse, and evaluate risks for logistical infrastructure that might threaten logistical processes. Only if those risks are known and their impact estimated, decision makers can implement counteractive measures to reduce risks. In this article, we develop a network-based approach that allows for the evaluation of risks and their consequences onto the logistical network. We will demonstrate the relevance of this approach by applying it to the logistics network of the central German state of Hesse. Even though transport data is extensively tracked and recorded nowadays, typical daily risks, like accidents on a motorway, and <b>extraordinary</b> <b>risks,</b> like a bridge at risk to collapse, terrorist attacks or climate-related catastrophes, are not systematically anticipated. Several studies unveiled recently that the overall impact for an economy of possible failures of single nodes and/or edges in a network are not calculated, and particularly critical edges are not identified in advance. We address this information gap by a method that helps to identify and quantify risks in a given network. To reach this objective, we define a mathematical optimization model that quantifies the current “risk-related costs” of the overall network and quantify the risk by investigating the change of the overall costs in the case a risk is realized...|$|R

40|$|Background: Indigenous {{communities}} in Queensland (Australia) {{have been subject}} to Alcohol Management Plans since 2002 / 03, with signifcant penalties for breaching restrictions. ‘Sly grog’ and ‘homebrew’ provide access to alcohol despite restrictions. This paper describes how this alcohol is made available and the risks and impacts involved. In afected towns and communities across a large area of rural and remote Queensland, interviews and focus groups documented experiences and views of 255 long-standing community members and service providers. Using an inductive framework, transcribed interviews were analysed to identify supply mechanisms, community and service provider responses and impacts experienced. Results: ‘Homebrew’ was reportedly manufactured in just a few localities, in locally-specifc forms bringing locallyspecifc harms. However, ‘sly grog’ sourced from licensed premises located long distances from communities, is a widespread concern across the region. ‘Sly grog’ sellers circumvent retailers’ takeaway liquor license conditions, stockpile alcohol outside restricted areas, send hoax messages to divert enforcement and take <b>extraordinary</b> <b>risks</b> to avoid apprehension. Police face signifcant challenges to enforce restrictions. On-selling of ‘sly grog’ appears more common in remote communities with total prohibition. Despite diferent motives for involvement in an illicit trade ‘sly grog’ consumers and sellers receive similar penalties. Conclusions: There is a need for: (a) a more sophisticated regional approach to managing takeaway alcohol sales from licensed suppliers, (b) targeted penalties for ‘sly grog’ sellers that refect its signifcant community impact, (c) strategies to reduce the demand for alcohol and (d) research to assess the efects of these strategies in reducing harms.

Shortly after the platoon established a defensive perimeter around the aircraft, a large enemy force attacked the position from 3 sides with a heavy volume of automatic weapons fire and grenades. The platoon leader and his radio operator were wounded almost immediately, and Sp5 McWethy rushed across the fire-swept area to their assistance. Although he could not help the mortally wounded radio operator, Sp5c. McWethy's timely first aid enabled the platoon leader to retain command during this critical period. Hearing a call for aid, Sp5 McWethy started across the open toward the injured men, but was wounded in the head and knocked to the ground. He regained his feet and continued on but was hit again, this time in the leg. Struggling onward despite his wounds, he gained the side of his comrades and treated their injuries. Observing another fallen rifleman lying in an exposed position raked by enemy fire, Sp5 McWethy moved toward him without hesitation. Although the enemy fire wounded him a third time, Sp5 McWethy reached his fallen companion. Though weakened and in extreme pain, Sp5 McWethy gave the wounded man artificial respiration but suffered a fourth and fatal wound. Through his indomitable courage, complete disregard for his safety, and demonstrated concern for his fellow soldiers, Sp5 McWethy inspired the members of his platoon and contributed in great measure to their successful defense of the position and the ultimate rout of the enemy force. Sp5 McWethy's profound sense of duty, bravery, and his willingness to accept <b>extraordinary</b> <b>risks</b> in order to help the men of his unit are characteristic of the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself and the U.S. Army.|$|R
40|$|Research on highly {{pathogenic}} organisms {{is crucial}} for medi-cine and public health, and we strongly support it. This work creates a foundation of new knowledge that provides critical in-sights around the world’s most deadly infectious diseases, and it can lay groundwork for the future development of new diagnos-tics, medicines, and vaccines. Almost all such research can be per-formed in ways that pose negligible or no risk of epidemic or global spread of a novel pathogen. However, research that aims to create new potential pandemic pathogens (PPP) (1) —novel mi-crobes that combine likely human virulence with likely efficient transmission in humans—is an exception to that rule. While this research represents a tiny portion of the experimental work done in infectious disease research, it poses <b>extraordinary</b> potential <b>risks</b> to the public.
