With smaller <b>diffusion</b> <b>capacitances,</b> SOI transistors switch significantly faster than their traditional bulk MOS counterparts and consume less power per switching. However, design and simulation of SOI MOS circuits is more challenging due to more complex behavior of an SOI transistor involving floating body effects, delay dependence on history of transistor switching, bipolar effect and others. This paper is devoted to developing a fast table model of SOI transistors, suitable for use in fast transistor level simulators. We propose using body charge instead of body potential as an independent variable of the model to improve convergence of circuit simulation integration algorithm. SOI transistor has one additional terminal compared with the bulk MOSFET and hence requires larger tables to model. We propose a novel transformation to reduce number of table dimensions and as a result to make the size of the tables reasonable. The paper also presents efficient implementation of our SOI transistor table model using piece-wise polynomial approximation, nonuniform grid discretization, and splitting the transistor model into the model of its equilibrium and non equilibrium states. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated by employing it in a fast transistor level simulator to simulate high performance industrial SOI microprocessor circuits. ...|$|R

Precise evaluation of the capacitance and Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR) is based on fitting the experimental data by an exponential function of voltage vs. time. The ESR increases linearly with the number (No) of cycles for both 75 % and 100 % energy cycling, whereas a super-linear increase of ESR vs. time of cycling is observed for the 100 % energy cycling. A decrease of capacitance in time had been evaluated for 2000 hours of ageing of SC. A relative change of capacitance is ΔC/C 0 = 16 % for the 75 % energy cycling test and ΔC/C 0 = 20 % for the 100 % energy cycling test at temperature 25 °C, while ΔC/C 0 = 6 % for the calendar test at temperature 22 °C for a voltage bias V = 1. 0 Vop.

With the continued down-scaling of minimum gate length of MOSFET to the deep sub-micrometer regime, radio-frequency (RF) integrated circuits on silicon CMOS technology are achievable and have become of increasing importance. Driven by the strong demand for low-cost personal wireless communication system in the gigahertz range, the monolithic integration of both active and passive devices together with digital VLSI circuits {{is the goal of}} CMOS RF integrated circuits. In this thesis, the active and passive devices on two variations of silicon CMOS technology, namely silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) CMOS and bulk CMOS, are designed and characterized for RF integrated circuits. For the SOS technology, RF circuit performances of both active and passive devices on a 0. 5 -μm process are compared with those of a 0. 5 -μm bulk CMOS counterpart. From the experimental results, the SOS technology shows better inductor quality factor (Q) of 3 to 4 times improvement. The usable frequency range however lies only in the range of 2 - 6 GHz. Further, the noise performance of the floating-body SOS MOSFET is in general inferior to that of the bulk CMOS by 1 dB. It degrades further at the post DC kink region due to floating body effects. The power amplification of floating-body SOS MOSFET, both small signal and large signal, is not affected by the floating body.

40|$|Photovoltaic (PV) {{conversion}} of solar energy {{appears to be}} one of the most promising ways of meeting the increasing future energy demand. In space, photovoltaic power source is the only alternative. The demand for higher power has necessitated the use of high speed switching charge controller and power conditioner. To design an efficient and reliable switching charge controller, the static (I-V) and dynamic (AC) characteristics of a solar cell need to be understood. The AC parameters of a solar cell can be measured either by Frequency Domain technique or by Time Domain technique. In frequency domain technique, a small signal is applied about the operating point and the AC parameters are measured. Hence, in the frequency domain technique the steady state values of AC parameters at a particular operating condition are measured. In time domain technique, a transient measurement is made where the cell voltage varies from short-circuit to open circuit or vice versa. Hence, this technique gives only the time constant of a solar cell. The impedance spectroscopy is a frequency domain technique widely used in electro chemistry to study battery characteristics. In the present investigation, the impedance spectroscopy is proposed for measuring the AC parameters of solar cells. An experimental set-up has been developed to measure the solar cell AC parameters. The AC parameters of Silicon (BSR and BSFR) solar cells and GaAs/Ge solar cells are measured using impedance spectroscopy (IS). The cell capacitance, the parallel resistance and the series resistance are measured and compared. GaAs/Ge solar cell has shown only transition Capacitance throughout its operating range while silicon (BSR and BSFR) solar cells exhibited both transition and <b>diffusion</b> <b>capacitances.</b> Theoretical and experimental values of the cell parallel resistance are compared and are in good agreement.

The dime domain technique could not estimate the solar cell. It may be noted that the impedance spectroscopy assumes piece-wise linearity of the solar cell characteristics, lending itself for easy measurement and modeling. This assumption is valid as the signal amplitude is less than thermal voltage (VT). Since, the parameters are measured under steady state, the values are more stable and accurate. An attempt has also been made to correlate the measured AC parameters with the requirements of switching charge controllers. These correlations can be used to design the switching controllers for device rating, circuit stability and other aspects...|$|R

Nyquist plots indicated the hierarchical carbons gradually depart from the characteristics of an ideal capacitor as the shell thickness increased. Ion transportation through the HCMS hierarchical structure, RC time constants and capacitance distribution across the carbon electrodes were derived from the 6 -loop TLM.

40|$|Human civilization {{relies on}} an {{abundant}} and sustainable supply of energy. Rapidly increasing energy consumption in past decades {{has resulted in}} a fossil-fuel shortage and ecological deterioration. Facing these challenges, humankind has been diligently seeking clean, safe and renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, waves and tides, to offset the diminishing availability or to take place of fossil fuels. At the same time, the search for strategies to reduce fossil-fuel consumption and decrease CO 2 emission, such as to replace tradition vehicles by electrical vehicles (EVs), is demanded. However, the energy harvested from renewable sources must be stored prior to its connection to electric grids or delivery to customers, and EVs need sufficient on-board power sources. These essential needs have made energy storage a critical component in the creation of sustainable society. 	Among all energy storage technologies, electrochemical energy storage within batteries or electrochemical capacitors (ECs) is the most promising approach, since as-stored chemical energy can be effectively delivered as electrical energy with high energy density and power density, high efficiency, long service life and effective cost. However, the performance of current batteries and ECs are constrained by poor material properties, though great effort has been made to improve materials during the past few years. The objective of this dissertation is to address the limitation of current energy storage materials by rational architecture design according to the well-recognized principles and criteria. To achieve this goal, the research strategy is to design and fabricate multifunctional architectures by integrating distinct material structures and properties to address the limitation of traditional materials and create a new family of high-performance energy storage materials with desired properties. 	Different types of energy storage architectures were investigated and compared with conventional structures to demonstrate such design concepts. First, hierarchically porous carbon particles with graphitized structures were designed and synthesized by an efficient aerosol-spray process. By comparison with commercially available activated carbon and CNTs, it was found that hierarchical pore architecture is important for providing high surface area and fast ion transport, which leads to high capacitance and high power EDLC materials. Secondly, MnO 2 /mesoporous carbon nanocomposites were designed. MnO 2 layers with different thicknesses were deposited on mesoporous carbon scaffolds with hierarchical pore structure and the charge storage performance of the composites was correlated to MnO 2 layer thickness. It was determined that a suitable thickness is critical to ensure good electronic conductivity, sufficient electrolyte <b>diffusion</b> and high <b>capacitance.</b> Thirdly, interpenetrating oxide nanowire/CNT network structures were designed and fabricated by an in situ hydrothermal reaction. The composition, CNT length, pore structure, V 2 O 5 structure, electrode thickness and architecture are critical factors. Synergistic effects obtained between V 2 O 5 nanowires and CNTs resulted in an optimal composition with the highest storage performance. Long CNTs led to robust flexible electrodes, while a hierarchical V 2 O 5 structure enabled storage of both lithium and sodium ions at high rates. Thus, electrode architectures can be engineered to achieve high-rate, thick electrodes for bulk energy storage. Last, various architectures obtained through integrating nanocrystals and CNTs were designed and fabricated using ultrafine TiO 2 nanocrystals as a model system. Electrodes were fabricated by directly coating thin film TiO 2 on conductive Indium-Tin-Oxide (ITO) glass, by conformably coating nanocrystals on pre-formed CNT papers, or by solvation-induced assembly between nanocrystals and CNTs. It was demonstrated that thick electrodes with high charge capacity, high rate performance and cycling stability rely on functional architecture that simultaneously provides high electronic conductivity, easy ion diffusion, abundant surface actives sites and robust structure and interfaces. 	The general conclusion derived from these studies is that the energy storage performance of electrode materials can be significantly improved by constructing rational architectures that provide effective ion diffusion, good electronic conductivity, fast electrode reaction, robust structure and a stable interface, which normally cannot be obtained with conventional materials. This strategy also can be extended to other devices, such as batteries and fuel cells, providing a general design platform for high performance energy materials. Further exploration in this research direction will ultimately lead to high energy, high power, and long life energy storage devices for many applications, including portable electronics, EVs and grid-scale energy storage...|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} of the transistor in 1947 at Bell Laboratories revolutionised the electronics industry and created a powerful platform for emergence of new industries. The quest {{to increase the number}} of devices per chip over the last four decades has resulted in rapid transition from Small-Scale-Integration (SSI) and Large-Scale-lntegration (LSI), through to the Very-Large-Scale-Integration (VLSI) technologies, incorporating approximately 10 to 100 million devices per chip. The next phase in this evolution is the Ultra-Large-Scale-Integration (ULSI) aiming to realise new application domains currently not accessible to CMOS technology. Although technology is continuously evolving to produce smaller systems with minimised power dissipation, the IC industry is facing major challenges due to constraints on power density (W/cm 2) and high dynamic (operating) and static (standby) power dissipation. Mobile multimedia communication and optical based technologies have rapidly become a significant area of research and development challenging a variety of technological fronts. The future emergence or 4 G (4 th Generation) wireless communications networks is further driving this development, requiring increasing levels of media rich content. The processing requirements for capture, conversion, compression, decompression, enhancement and display of higher quality multimedia, place heavy demands on current ULSI systems. This is also apparent for mobile applications and intelligent optical networks where silicon chip area and power dissipation become primary considerations. In addition to the requirements for very low power, compact size and real-time processing, the rapidly evolving nature of telecommunication networks means that flexible soft programmable systems capable of adaptation to support a number of different standards and/or roles become highly desirable. In order to fully realise the capabilities promised by the 4 G and supporting intelligent networks, new enabling technologies arc needed to facilitate the next generation of personal communications devices. Most of the current solutions to meet these challenges are based on various implementations of conventional architectures. For decades, silicon has been the main platform of computing, however it is slow, bulky, runs too hot, and is too expensive. Thus, new approaches to architectures, driving multimedia and future telecommunications systems, are needed in order to extend the life cycle of silicon technology. The emergence of Truly Deep Submicron Technology (TDST) and related 3 -D interconnection technologies have provided potential alternatives from conventional architectures to 3 -D system solutions, through integration of IDST, Vertical Software Mapping and Intelligent Interconnect Technology (IIT). The concept of Soft-Chip Technology (SCT) entails integration of 2 ̆ 2 Soft• Processing Circuits 2 ̆ 2 with 2 ̆ 2 Soft-Configurable Circuits 2 ̆ 2. This concept can effectively manipulate hardware primitives through vertical integration of control and data. Thus the notion of 3 -D Soft-Chip emerges as a new design algorithm for content-rich multimedia, telecommunication and intelligent networking system applications. 3 •D architectures (design algorithms used suitable for 3 -D soft-chip technology), are driven by three factors. The first is development of new device technology (TDST) that can support new architectures with complexities of 100 M to 1000 M devices. The second is development of advanced wafer bonding techniques such as Indium bump and the more futuristic optical interconnects for 3 -D soft-chip mapping. The third is related to improving the performance of silicon CMOS systems as devices continue to scale down in dimensions. One of the fundamental building blocks of any computer system is the arithmetic component. Optimum performance of the system is determined by the efficiency of each individual component, as well as the network as a whole entity. Development of configurable arithmetic primitives is the fundamental focus in 3 -D architecture design where functionality can be implemented through soft configurable hardware elements. Therefore the ability to improve the performance capability of a system is of crucial importance for a successful design. Important factors that predict the efficiency of such arithmetic components are: • The propagation delay of the circuit, caused by the gate, <b>diffusion</b> and wire <b>capacitances</b> within !he circuit, minimised through transistor sizing. and • Power dissipation, which is generally based on node transition activity. [2] Although optimum performance of 3 -D soft-chip systems is primarily established by the choice of basic primitives such as adders and multipliers, the interconnecting network also has significant degree of influence on !he efficiency of the system. 3 -D superposition of devices can decrease interconnect delays by up to 60...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} {{is made of}} the AC characteristics of a membrane consisting of two fixed charge regions of opposite sign, in contact. It is shown that the equivalent parallel capacitance and conductance of such a membrane undergo a strong dispersion at low frequencies. The dielectric dispersion {{is a result of}} polarization effects in the diffusion of coions in each of the two fixed charge lattices. This, at low frequencies, gives rise to a very large <b>diffusion</b> <b>capacitance.</b> The form of the dispersion characteristics is very similar to those observed for synthetic-fused anion-cation membranes and various cellular membranes...|$|E
40|$|The AC {{parameters}} of silicon (BSR and BSFR) solar cells and GaAs/Ge solar cell have been measured using impedance spectroscopy. Each cell capacitance, dynamic resistance and series resistance were measured and compared. GaAs/Ge solar cell has shown only the transition capacitance throughout its operating range while silicon (BSR and BSFR) solar cells exhibited both transition and <b>diffusion</b> <b>capacitance.</b> The theoretical and experimental values of dynamic resistance were compared and found in good agreement while the diode factor in silicon solar cells varies from 2 to 1, where as in GaAs/Ge solar cell it varies from 4 to 2 to 1...|$|E
