5|$|IMF members {{signed the}} Jamaica Agreement in January 1976, which {{ratified}} {{the end of}} the Bretton Woods system and reoriented the Fund's role in supporting the international monetary system. The agreement officially embraced the <b>flexible</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes that emerged after the failure of the Smithsonian Agreement measures. In tandem with floating exchange rates, the agreement endorsed central bank interventions aimed at clearing excessive volatility. The agreement retroactively formalized the abandonment of gold as a reserve instrument and the Fund subsequently demonetized its gold reserves, returning gold to members or selling it to provide poorer nations with relief funding. Developing countries and countries not endowed with oil export resources enjoyed greater access to IMF lending programs as a result. The Fund continued assisting nations experiencing balance of payments deficits and currency crises, but began imposing conditionality on its funding that required countries to adopt policies aimed at reducing deficits through spending cuts and tax increases, reducing protective trade barriers, and contractionary monetary policy.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{dominance}} of <b>flexible</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regimes, the foreign exchange markets became significantly more volatile. In 1980, newly elected U.S. President Ronald Reagan's administration brought about increasing balance of payments deficits and budget deficits. To finance these deficits, the United States offered artificially high real interest rates to attract large inflows of foreign capital. As foreign investors' demand for U.S. dollars grew, the dollar's value appreciated substantially until reaching its peak in February 1985. The U.S. trade deficit grew to $160 billion in 1985 ($341 billion in 2012 dollars) {{as a result of}} the dollar's strong appreciation. The G5 met in September 1985 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City and agreed that the dollar should depreciate against the major currencies to resolve the United States' trade deficit and pledged to support this goal with concerted foreign exchange market interventions, in what became known as the Plaza Accord. The U.S. dollar continued to depreciate, but industrialized nations became increasingly concerned that it would decline too heavily and that exchange rate volatility would increase. To address these concerns, the G7 (now G8) held a summit in Paris in 1987, where they agreed to pursue improved exchange rate stability and better coordinate their macroeconomic policies, in what became known as the Louvre Accord. This accord became the provenance of the managed float regime by which central banks jointly intervene to resolve under- and overvaluations in the foreign exchange market to stabilize otherwise freely floating currencies. Exchange rates stabilized following the embrace of managed floating during the 1990s, with a strong U.S. economic performance from 1997 to 2000 during the Dot-com bubble. After the 2000 stock market correction of the Dot-com bubble the country's trade deficit grew, the September 11 attacks increased political uncertainties, and the dollar began to depreciate in 2001.|$|E
25|$|Under a fixed {{exchange}} rate system, the central bank accommodates those flows by buying up any net inflow of funds into the country or by providing foreign currency funds to the foreign exchange market to match any international outflow of funds, thus preventing the funds flows from affecting the exchange rate between the country's currency and other currencies. Then the net change {{per year in the}} central bank's foreign exchange reserves is sometimes called the balance of payments surplus or deficit. Alternatives to a {{fixed exchange}} rate system include a managed float where some changes of exchange rates are allowed, or at the other extreme a purely floating exchange rate (also known as a purely <b>flexible</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate).</b> With a pure float the central bank does not intervene at all to protect or devalue its currency, allowing the rate to be set by the market, and the central bank's foreign exchange reserves do not change, and the balance of payments is always zero.|$|E

5000|$|In {{joint work}} with Federico Sturzenegger, Eduardo Levy Yeyati {{developed}} a classification of exchange rate regimes de facto {{in the paper}} [...] "Classyfing Exchange Rate Regimes: Deeds vs. Words". Stuzenegger and Levy Yeyati highlighted {{that most of the}} empirical literature on exchange rate regimes had been using the IMF de jure classification based on official sources, despite well-known inconsistencies between reported and actual policies. The authors argued that many countries that in theory adopted a <b>flexible</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime intervened in exchange markets so pervasively that for practical purposes (in terms of observable performance) they could be assimilated to countries with explicit fixed exchange rate regimes. Conversely, periodic exchange rate realignments in inflation-prone peg countries reflected a monetary policy more inconsistent with <b>flexible</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> arrangements.|$|E

40|$|There is {{a long-standing}} debate among economists and policymakers on the {{benefits}} of <b>flexible</b> versus fixed <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> (Klein and Shambaugh 2010). In principle, <b>flexible</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> allow a country’s central bank to focus on stabilizing economic growth and inflation, which are the ultimate goals of monetary policy. However, some argue that in practice central banks often do not use their powers wisely and it may be better to restrict their freedom by requiring them to peg their currency to that of an important trading partner. Others note that <b>flexible</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> are far more volatile than fundamental factors can explain (Flood and Rose 1995), raising the possibility that they may introduce wasteful cross-sectoral fluctuations in economic activity.

50|$|To {{find out}} {{empirical}} statistics to assess this phenomenon, we could consider some countries with relatively pure floating regimes as benchmark cases, for example United States and Japan.

50|$|Supposing {{that the}} {{currency}} is managed properly, {{the larger the}} area, the better. In contrast with the previous model, asymmetric shocks are not considered to undermine the common currency because {{of the existence of}} the common currency. This spreads the shocks in the area because all regions share claims on each other in the same currency and can use them for dampening the shock, while in a <b>flexible</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime, the cost will be concentrated on the individual regions, since the devaluation will reduce its buying power. So despite a less fine tuned monetary policy the real economy should do better.|$|E

50|$|Consider an {{exogenous}} {{increase in}} government expenditure. Under the IS-LM model, the IS curve shifts upward, with the LM curve intact, causing {{the interest rate}} and output to rise. But for a small open economy with perfect capital mobility and a <b>flexible</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> the domestic interest rate is predetermined by the horizontal BoP curve, and so by the LM equation given previously there is exactly one level of output that can make the money market be in equilibrium at that interest rate.

50|$|In a pure <b>flexible</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> regime or {{floating}} {{exchange rate}} regime, {{the central bank}} does not intervene in the exchange rate dynamics; hence the exchange rate {{is determined by the}} market.

Milton Friedman was a strong advocate of flexible exchange rates, since he considered that independent monetary (and in some cases fiscal) policy and openness of the capital account are more valuable than a fixed exchange rate. Also, he valued the role of exchange rate as a price. As a matter of fact, he believed that sometimes it could be less painful and thus desirable to adjust only one price (the exchange rate) than the whole set of prices of goods and wages of the economy, that are less flexible.|$|E
40|$|Will {{a country}} {{embedded}} {{in an integrated}} world economy be able to completely insulate its economy from foreign economic disturbances by letting its currency float freely in the foreign exchange market? Both theoretical considerations and the actual experience after the movement to <b>flexible</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> among the major currencies in 1973 suggest {{that the answer is}} no. According to conventional wisdom, however, the early advocates of <b>flexible</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> in the 1950 s and 1960 s believed in the ability of floating rates to completely insulate an economy from disturbances originating abroad. This statement is frequently cited to show that the case for <b>flexible</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> may not be as strong as it originally seemed to be, since part of the case appears to have rested on an erroneous belief. It is one purpose of this paper to point out that, contrary to a widespread view, the outstanding early advocates of <b>flexible</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> like Milton Friedman (1953), Egon Sohmen (1961; 1969) and Harry Johnson (1969) never promised complete and automatic insulation from all kinds of foreign economic disturbances.

The main purpose of the paper is to contrast Sohmen's true promise, {{as well as that of}} other theorists', with the empirical evidence from the period of floating <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> since 197 3 and to discuss several explanations for some remaining discrepancies between predictions and outcome. ...|$|R
