5|$|Certain {{disorders}} occur {{more often}} in people with epilepsy, depending partly on the epilepsy syndrome present. These include depression, anxiety, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), and migraine. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder affects three to <b>five</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> children with epilepsy than children without the condition. ADHD and epilepsy have significant consequences on a child's behavioral, learning, and social development. Epilepsy is also more common in children with autism.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} are being studied for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, including bedaquiline and delamanid. Bedaquiline received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in late 2012. The {{safety and effectiveness}} of these new agents are still uncertain, because {{they are based on}} the results of a relatively small studies. However, existing data suggest that patients taking bedaquiline in addition to standard TB therapy are <b>five</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> likely to die than those without the new drug, which has resulted in medical journal articles raising health policy questions about why the FDA approved the drug and whether financial ties to the company making bedaquiline influenced physicians' support for its use.|$|E

5|$|Globally, {{autism is}} {{estimated}} to affect 24.8 million people as of 2015. As of 2010, {{the number of people}} affected is estimated at about 1–2 per 1,000 worldwide. It occurs four to <b>five</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> often in boys than girls. About 1.5% of children in the United States (one in 68) are diagnosed with ASD , a 30% increase from one in 88 in 2012. The rate of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the United Kingdom is 1.1%. The number of people diagnosed has been increasing dramatically since the 1980s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice; the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved.|$|E
5|$|Since Nintendo did {{not have}} many products, it made only a few {{commercials}} a year, meaning the quality had to be phenomenal. The budget for a single commercial could reach US $5 million, easily four or <b>five</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> than most companies spent. One of the first commercials made under Bill White, director of advertising and public relations, was the market introduction for the Legend of Zelda, which received {{a great deal of}} attention in the ad industry.

5|$|Unlike most {{electrical}} insulators, diamond {{is a good}} {{conductor of}} heat because of the strong covalent bonding and low phonon scattering. Thermal conductivity of natural diamond {{was measured to be}} about 2200W/(m·K), which is <b>five</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> than copper. Monocrystalline synthetic diamond enriched to 99.9% the isotope 12C has the highest thermal conductivity of any known solid at room temperature: 3320W/(m·K). Because diamond has such high thermal conductance it is already used in semiconductor manufacture to prevent silicon and other semiconducting materials from overheating. At lower temperatures conductivity becomes even better, and reaches 41000W/(m·K) at 104K (12C-enriched diamond).|$|E
25|$|There is {{also the}} {{cognitive}} perspective. Theorists believe that people with panic disorder may experience panic reactions because they mistake their bodily sensations for life-threatening situations. These bodily sensations cause some people to feel as though {{are out of control}} which may lead to feelings of panic. This misconception of bodily sensations is referred to as anxiety sensitivity and studies suggest that the people who score higher on anxiety sensitivity surveys than other people, are <b>fives</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> likely to be diagnosed with panic disorder.|$|R

5|$|In April 1944, {{tests on}} the first sample of {{plutonium}} that had been produced with neutrons in a nuclear reactor revealed that reactor-bred plutonium contained <b>five</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> plutonium-240 than that hitherto produced in a cyclotrons. This unwanted isotope that spontaneously decayed and produced neutrons promised to cause a predetonation without sufficiently quick critical mass assembly. It now became apparent that only implosion would work for practical plutonium bombs; a powerful enough gun could not be constructed small enough to be carried in an aircraft, and plutonium-240 was {{even more difficult to}} separate from plutonium-239 than the isotopes of uranium that were giving the rest of the Manhattan Project such difficulties. Plutonium was unusable unless implosion worked, but only plutonium could be produced in quantities that would allow regular production of atomic bombs. Thus, the implosion technique now suddenly stood as the key to production of nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|Locusts yield about <b>five</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> {{edible protein}} {{per unit of}} fodder than cattle, and produce lower levels of {{greenhouse}} gases in the process. The feed conversion rate of orthopterans is 1.7kg/kg, while for beef it is typically about 10kg/kg. The protein content in fresh weight is between 13–28 g/100g for adult locust, 14–18 g/100g for larvae, as compared to 19–26 g/100g for beef. The calculated protein efficiency ratio is however low, with 1.69 for locust protein compared to 2.5 for standard casein. A serving of 100 g of desert locust provides 11.5 g of fat, 53.5% of which is unsaturated, and 286mg of cholesterol. Among the fatty acids, palmitoleic, oleic and linolenic acids {{were found to be}} the most abundant. Varying amounts of potassium, sodium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc were present.|$|E
5|$|Truck drivers {{spend up to}} 11hours a day driving, and up to 14hours a day {{engaged in}} various duties (including driving time) such as fueling, filling out paperwork, obtaining vehicle repairs, and {{conducting}} mandatory vehicle inspections. Long-haul drivers often spend weeks away from home, spending their time off and sleeping at truck stops or rest areas. Driving is relatively dangerous work, as truck drivers account for 12 percent and the highest total number of all work-related deaths, and are <b>five</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> likely to die on the job than the average worker. Smoking, lack of exercise, unhealthy eating habits, and work-related injuries {{also contribute to the}} driver's generally risk-prone lifestyle. A survey by the National Institutes of Health found 67 percent of long-haul drivers were smokers or had quit smoking.|$|E

5|$|The {{pituitary}} gland {{is located in}} a recess in the skull base known as the sella turcica ("Turkish saddle", after its shape). It is attached to the hypothalamus, a part of the brain, by a stalk that also contains the blood vessels that supply the gland. It is unclear why pituitary tumors are <b>five</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> likely to bleed than other tumors in the brain. There are various proposed mechanisms by which a tumor can increase the risk of either infarction (insufficient blood supply leading to tissue dysfunction) or hemorrhage. The {{pituitary gland}} normally derives its blood supply from vessels that pass through the hypothalamus, but tumors develop a blood supply from the nearby inferior hypophyseal artery that generates a higher blood pressure, possibly accounting for the risk of bleeding. Tumors may also be more sensitive to fluctuations in blood pressure, and the blood vessels may show structural abnormalities that make them vulnerable to damage. It has been suggested that infarction alone causes milder symptoms than either hemorrhage or hemorrhagic infarction (infarction followed by hemorrhage into the damaged tissue). Larger tumors are more prone to bleeding, and more rapidly growing lesions (as evidenced by detection of increased levels of the protein PCNA) may also be at a higher risk of apoplexy.|$|E
5|$|With Luminous Studio, {{real-time}} {{scenes in}} XV have five million polygons per frame, with character models {{made up of}} about 100,000 polygons each. Character models for XV were constructed with 600 bones, estimated as roughly 10-12 times more than seventh generation hardware. About 150 bones are used for the face, 300 for the hair and clothes, and 150 for the body. For the characters' hair, the team used the same technique as with the characters in Agni's Philosophy. The inner hair for each character uses about 20,000 polygons, <b>five</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> than seventh generation hardware. The data capacity for textures is also much greater than before. Each character uses 30 MB of texture data, and ten levels of detail. While seventh-generation games used 50 to 100 MB of texture data for a scene, Final Fantasy XV can use about sixteen times this amount on the PlayStation 4 console. 2048×2048 and 4096×4096 texels are used for the HD textures. For the Microsoft Windows port, Luminous Studio was upgraded using technology from Nvidia.|$|E
