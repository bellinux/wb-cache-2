40|$|With {{increasing}} economical {{and technical}} requirements {{the design and}} construction of long lasting asphalt pavements {{is becoming more and}} more important. Apart from good structural properties of the individual layers, in this context, the <b>interlayer</b> <b>adhesion</b> plays an important, but often neglected, role. In order to achieve a good bond between the different layers tack coats are often used. This paper describes the results of an extensive investigation into the <b>interlayer</b> <b>adhesion</b> of gyratory specimens using a variety of different tack coats. The <b>interlayer</b> <b>adhesion</b> is determined with the Layer-Parallel Direct Shear (LPDS) tester. The behaviour of specimens with and without tack coat on a rough and a smooth surface is compared. Another aspect of this paper is the influence of moisture, heat and water on the mechanism of tack coats. Findings clearly indicate that, although the application of tack coats on laboratory specimens does not necessarily result in a better <b>interlayer</b> <b>adhesion,</b> the potential of tack coats regarding heat and water must not be ignored...|$|E

The relatively high hardness of the fast deposited a-C:H material leads to high compressive stress resulting in poor adhesion between the carbon films and common substrates like silicon, glass and steel. A widespread {{solution to this problem}} is the use of an <b>adhesion</b> <b>interlayer.</b> Here we report on the changes in adhesion between the graphite-like a-C:H films and M 2 steel substrates when different types of interlayers are used. Insignificant to very small improvements in adhesion were observed when using amorphous silicon oxide (a-SiO(x)), amorphous organosilicon (a-SiC(x) O(y),:H(z)) and amorphous hydrogenated silicon carbide (a-Sic(x) :H(y)) as adhesion layers. However, when sputtered Ti was used as an <b>interlayer,</b> the <b>adhesion</b> increased significantly. The dependence of the adhesive properties on the deposition temperature and interlayer thickness, {{as well as on the}} thickness of the a-C:H layer is presented and discussed.

Pin wear was reduced {{by a factor of}} 140 and disk wear was reduced by a factor of 2. 5 compared to the baseline. These films retain their good tribological properties including adhesion after heat treatments at 850 C and thus may be able to lubricate over a wide temperature range. This lubrication technique is applicable to space lubrication, advanced heat engines, and advanced transportation systems...|$|R

Mechanical {{components}} and tools in modern industry are facing increasing performance requirements {{leading to the}} growing need for advanced materials and thus, for modern frictional systems. In the last decades, the Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) has emerged as an unique tool to grow high quality mono- as well as multilayers surfaces in metallic/ceramic systems. Building up a knowledge base of tribological properties of industrially-scaled, room temperature deposited PLD hard coatings {{are the most important}} step for the application of these coatings in engineering design. Although single-layer coatings find a range of applications, there are an increasing number of applications where the properties of a single material are not sufficient. One way to surmount this problem is to use a multilayer coating. Application of metallic <b>interlayers</b> improves <b>adhesion</b> of nitride hard layer in multilayer systems, which has been used in PVD processes for many years, however, the PLD technique gives new possibilities to produce system comprising many bilayers at room temperature. Tribological coatings consisted of 2, 4 and 16 bilayers of Cr/CrN and Ti/TiN type were fabricated with the Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) technique in the presented work. It is found in transmission electron examinations on thin foils prepared from cross-section that both nitride-based multilayer structures studied are characterized by small columnar crystallite sizes and high defect density, what might rise their hardness but compromise coating adhesion. The intermediate metallic layers contained larger sized and less defective columnar structure compared to the nitride layers, which should improv...|$|R
