25|$|When {{the ground}} is not {{available}} (such as in a vehicle) other metallic surfaces {{can serve as a}} <b>ground</b> <b>plane</b> (typically the vehicle's roof). Alternatively, radial wires placed {{at the base of the}} antenna can form a <b>ground</b> <b>plane.</b> For VHF and UHF bands, the radiating and <b>ground</b> <b>plane</b> elements can be constructed from rigid rods or tubes. For a simple 1/4-wave whip, the radials are often sloped at a 45 degree angle to bring the feed point impedance closer to 50 ohms. Since this will introduce RF energy on the shield of the unbalanced feed line which deforms the radiation pattern of the antenna, a choke is often placed near the feed point.|$|E
25|$|The earth {{can be used}} as <b>ground</b> <b>plane,</b> but it is a poor conductor. The {{reflected}} antenna {{image is}} only clear at glancing angles (far from the antenna). At these glancing angles, electromagnetic fields and radiation patterns are the same as for a half-wave dipole. Naturally, the impedance of the earth is far inferior to that of a good conductor <b>ground</b> <b>plane.</b> This can be improved (at cost) by laying a copper mesh.|$|E
25|$|Some {{types of}} {{transmitting}} antenna {{systems in the}} VLF, LF, MF and lower SW range must have a good ground to operate efficiently. For example, a vertical monopole antenna requires a <b>ground</b> <b>plane</b> that often consists of an interconnected network of wires running radially away {{from the base of}} the antenna for a distance about equal to the height of the antenna. Sometimes a counterpoise is used as a <b>ground</b> <b>plane,</b> supported above the ground.|$|E

25|$|Several {{artists in}} the 1980s and 1990s contributed work that {{influenced}} or took part in deconstructivism. Maya Lin and Rachel Whiteread are two examples. Lin's 1982 project for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, with its granite slabs severing the <b>ground</b> <b>plane,</b> is one. Its shard-like form and reduction of content to a minimalist text influenced deconstructivism, with its sense of fragmentation and emphasis on reading the monument. Lin also contributed work for Eisenman's Wexner Center. Rachel Whiteread's cast architectural spaces are another instance where contemporary art is confluent with architecture. Ghost (1990), an entire living space cast in plaster, solidifying the void, alludes to Derrida's notion of architectural presence. Gordon Matta-Clark's Building cuts were deconstructed sections of buildings exhibited in art galleries.|$|E
40|$|To solve {{many of the}} {{problems}} encountered when using conventional coplanar waveguide (CPW) with its semiinfinite <b>ground</b> <b>planes,</b> a new version of coplanar waveguide with electrically narrow <b>ground</b> <b>planes</b> has been developed. This new transmission line which we call Finite Ground Coplanar (FGC) waveguide has several advantages which make it a better transmission line for RF and wireless circuits. Since the <b>ground</b> <b>planes</b> are electrically narrow, spurious resonances created by the CPW <b>ground</b> <b>planes</b> and the metal carrier or package base are eliminated. In addition, lumped and distributed circuit elements may now be integrated into the ground strips {{in the same way as}} they traditionally have been integrated into the center conductor to realize novel circuit layouts that are smaller and have less parasitic reactance. Lastly, FGC is shown to have lower coupling between adjacent transmission lines than conventional CPW...|$|R

25|$|Each trace {{consists}} of a flat, narrow part of the copper foil that remains after etching.

In a multi-layer board one entire layer may be mostly solid copper to act as a <b>ground</b> <b>plane</b> for shielding and power return. For microwave circuits, transmission lines can be laid out in a planar form such as stripline or microstrip with carefully controlled dimensions to assure a consistent impedance. In radio-frequency and fast switching circuits the inductance and capacitance of the printed circuit board conductors become significant circuit elements, usually undesired; but they {{can be used as a}} deliberate part of the circuit design, obviating the need for additional discrete components.|$|E

Although the drawing's attribution has been doubted, it is now accepted as authentic. The elaboration of the plaited hair suggests that the drawing was made from life using a young girl as the model. The drawing was made in three stages: first it was lightly laid down in black chalk, then gone over with pen and light bistre, and finally drawn over completely with a finer pen and darker ink.

500|$|A printed inverted-F antenna can be {{implemented}} in the classic inverted-F shape, usually {{to one side of}} the circuit board where the <b>ground</b> <b>plane</b> has been removed from underneath the antenna. [...] However, another approach is a modified patch antenna, the shorted patch antenna. [...] In this approach, one edge of the patch, or some intermediate point, is grounded with grounding pins or vias through to the <b>ground</b> <b>plane.</b> [...] This works on the same principle as an inverted-F; viewed sideways, the F shape can be seen, it is just that the antenna element is very wide in the horizontal plane. [...] The shorted patch antenna has a wider bandwidth than the thin line type due to the greater radiation area. [...] Like the thin line type, the shorted patch antenna can be printed on the same printed circuit board as the rest of the circuitry. [...] However, they are commonly printed on to their own board, or on to a dielectric fixed to the main board. [...] This is done so that the antenna, can be suspended and effectively be in air dielectric, is a greater distance from the <b>ground</b> <b>plane</b> than it would otherwise be, or the dielectric used is a more suitable material for RF performance.|$|E

500|$|The inverted-F antenna is an {{evolution}} of the basic quarter-wave monopole antenna. [...] The wire F-type antenna was invented in the 1940s. [...] In this antenna the feed is connected to an intermediate point {{along the length of}} the antenna instead of to the base. [...] The base is connected to ground. [...] The advantage of doing this is that the input impedance of the antenna is dependent on the distance of the feed point from the grounded end. [...] The portion of the antenna between the feedpoint and the <b>ground</b> <b>plane</b> is essentially behaving as a short-circuit stub. [...] Thus, the designer can match the antenna to the system impedance by setting the position of the feed point (RF systems commonly have a system impedance of 50 Ω whereas a λ/4 monopole has an impedance of 36.5 Ω).|$|E
