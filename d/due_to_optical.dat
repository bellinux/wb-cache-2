5|$|An owl's {{eyes are}} {{placed at the}} front of the head and have a field overlap of 50–70%, giving it better {{binocular}} vision than diurnal birds of prey (overlap 30–50%). The tawny owl's retina has about 56,000 light-sensitive rod cells per square millimetre (36million per square inch); although earlier claims that it could see in the infrared part of the spectrum have been dismissed, it is still often said to have eyesight 10 to 100 times better than humans in low-light conditions. However, the experimental basis for this claim is probably inaccurate by at least a factor of 10. The owl's actual visual acuity is only slightly greater than that of humans, and any increased sensitivity is <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>optical</b> factors rather than to greater retinal sensitivity; both humans and owl have reached the limit of resolution for the retinas of terrestrial vertebrates.|$|E

50|$|A human cannot perform these {{feats of}} {{perception}} at both extremes {{of the scale}} at the same time. The eyes take time to adjust to different light levels, and the dynamic range of the human eye in a given scene is actually quite limited <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>optical</b> glare. The instantaneous dynamic range of human audio perception is similarly subject to masking so that, for example, a whisper cannot be heard in loud surroundings.|$|E

A colorimetric correspondence is carried out between a calibration standard made of nano-steps and the analyzed sample.

This leads to 3D-representation of the analyzed samples, the measurement of profile sections, roughness and other topological measurements.|$|E

50|$|Louis Pasteur could rightly be {{described}} as the first stereochemist, having observed in 1849 that salts of tartaric acid collected from wine production vessels could rotate plane polarized light, but that salts from other sources did not. This property, the only physical property in which the two types of tartrate salts differed, is <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>optical</b> isomerism. In 1874, Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff and Joseph Le Bel explained optical activity in terms of the tetrahedral arrangement of the atoms bound to carbon.|$|E
50|$|Photothermal {{spectroscopy}} is a {{group of}} high sensitivity spectroscopy techniques used to measure optical absorption and thermal characteristics of a sample. The basis of photothermal spectroscopy is the change in thermal state of the sample resulting from the absorption of radiation. Light absorbed and not lost by emission results in heating. The heat raises temperature thereby influencing the thermodynamic properties of the sample or of a suitable material adjacent to it. Measurement of the temperature, pressure, or density changes that occur <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>optical</b> absorption are ultimately the basis for the photothermal spectroscopic measurements.|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} van Maanen's {{measurement}} errors {{emerged from his}} stereo blink comparator, which van Maanen used to compare new plates with plates some 10-20 years old. By blinking between those two plates he could detect small discrepancies on {{the positions of the}} objects. His reference objects were the field stars fairly {{near the edge of the}} plates. However he didn't consider that <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>optical</b> effects these stars had been smeared out a little towards the edges, slightly different for the two plates. This caused systematic errors resulting in imaginary movements.|$|E

50|$|With {{increasing}} temperature, phonon concentration {{increases and}} causes increased scattering. Thus lattice scattering lowers the carrier mobility {{more and more}} at higher temperature. Theoretical calculations reveal that the mobility in non-polar semiconductors, such as silicon and germanium, is dominated by acoustic phonon interaction. The resulting mobility {{is expected to be}} proportional to T −3/2, while the mobility <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>optical</b> phonon scattering only is expected to be proportional to T −1/2. Experimentally, values of the temperature dependence of the mobility in Si, Ge and GaAs are listed in table.|$|E
50|$|Errors in {{communication}} can be broadly classified into two types: Loss errors (<b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>optical</b> fiber/environment) and operation errors (such as depolarization, dephasing etc.). While redundancy {{can be used}} to detect and correct classical errors, redundant qubits cannot be created due to the no-cloning theorem. As a result, other types of error correction must be introduced such as the Shor code or {{one of a number of}} more general and efficient codes. All of these codes work by distributing the quantum information across multiple entangled qubits so that operation errors as well as loss errors can be corrected.|$|E
50|$|<b>Due</b> <b>to</b> <b>optical</b> effects the {{contrast}} may be sub-optimal and approaches zero before the Nyquist {{frequency of the}} display is reached. The optical contrast reduction can be partially reversed by digitally amplifying spatial frequencies selectively before display or further processing. Although more advanced digital image restoration procedures exist, the Wiener deconvolution algorithm is often used for its simplicity and efficiency. Since this technique multiplies the spatial spectral components of the image, it also amplifies noise and errors due to e.g. aliasing. It is therefore only effective on good quality recordings with a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio.|$|E

50|$|Magnifying glasses {{typically}} have low magnifying power: 2×-6×, with the lower-power types being much more common. At higher magnifications, the image {{quality of a}} simple magnifying glass becomes poor <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>optical</b> aberrations, particularly spherical aberration. When more magnification or a better image is required, other types of hand magnifier are typically used. A Coddington magnifier provides higher magnification with improved image quality. Even better images can be obtained with a multiple-lens magnifier, such as a Hastings triplet. High power magnifiers are sometimes mounted in a cylindrical or conical holder with no handle. This is called a loupe.|$|E
50|$|A microlens {{is a small}} lens, {{generally}} with {{a diameter}} less than a millimetre (mm) and often as small as 10 micrometres (µm). The small sizes of the lenses means that a simple design can give good optical quality but sometimes unwanted effects arise <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>optical</b> diffraction at the small features. A typical microlens may be a single element with one plane surface and one spherical convex surface to refract the light. Because microlenses are so small, the substrate that supports them is usually thicker than the lens and {{this has to be}} taken into account in the design. More sophisticated lenses may use aspherical surfaces and others may use several layers of optical material to achieve their design performance.|$|E
50|$|Halteres {{and vision}} both {{play a role}} in {{stabilizing}} the head. Flies are also able to perform compensatory head movements to stabilize their vision without the use of their halteres. When the visual field is artificially rotated around a fly at slower angular velocities, head stabilization still occurs. Head stabilization outputs <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>optical</b> inputs alone are slower to respond, but also last longer than those due to haltere inputs. From this result it can be concluded that although halteres are required for detecting fast rotations, the visual system is adept by itself at sensing and correcting for slower body movements. Thus, the visual and mechanosensory (halteres) systems work together to stabilize the visual field of the animal: first, by quickly responding to fast changes (halteres), and second, by maintaining that response until it is corrected (vision).|$|E
