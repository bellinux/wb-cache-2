40|$|The Ariake clay, i. e. {{the soft}} marine {{alluvial}} clay, is sedimented along the Ariake Sea, {{especially in the}} Saga plain, Kyushu, Japan. It is well {{known as one of}} the most problematic soils in japan, because of its high sensitivity and remarkable secondary compression. Therefore, an established method for settlement prediction is necessary to be establised as well as to be developed a countermeasure to control long-term settlement. This paper describes three case histories on settlement of the Ariake clay ground including long-term settlements which have been observed over 14 years since the construction of embankment. The aim of this paper is to examine the applicability of three proposed pre-prediction methods to estimate the settlements of the Ariake soft clay ground before <b>filling</b> <b>work,</b> from comparison of the observed with calculated settlements.

40|$|A functional-structural model (FSPM) is {{proposed}} to simulate carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) metabolism within the wheat plant. FSPM represent the biological processes within a realistic description of plant architecture. It {{is expected that}} this approach will strengthen our capacity to represent G*E interactions. Here culm structure is composed of a root compartment, a set of photosynthetic organs and the whole grains. A culm element consists of structural, storage (protein, starch, fructan) and mobile (sucrose amino acids and nitrate) materials. Culm elements are connected to a common pool hereafter called phloem, which allows circulation of mobile metabolites through the plant. Beside, compounds originating from roots are distributed to photosynthetic tissues according to transpiration. A key feature of the model is that C and N fluxes (syntheses, degradations, loading/unloading) in each organ depend on the local concentrations in metabolites. Activities modelled for the root are (i) uptake of nitrates (ii) synthesis of organic N and cytokinins, (iii) exudation of C and N, (iv) senescence. Activities modelled by photosynthetic organs are (i) photosynthesis (ii) synthesis of storage and mobile carbohydrates, (iii) synthesis of amino acids and protein turn-over, (iv) tissue death (v) loading of C and N into the phloem. Main activity for grain are growth and filling, driven by the metabolites in phloem. Implementation is completed for the post flowering stage. The model simulates realistic concentrations of C and N metabolites in plant organs, including grains. The model predicts the dynamics of C and N at both short-term (day/night alternation) and long-term, the latter being largely driven the drastic decrease in mobile C and N during grain <b>filling.</b> <b>Work</b> under progress extends the model to the regulation of morphogenesis during the preflowering period. Then we will use the model to investigate plant traits adapted to low-N agricultural practices...|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} work {{is aimed}} at muscle imbalance at administrative workers {{and the possibility of}} their influence by help of exercising SM system and ergonomics adjustment. Muscle imbalance at administrative workers come into existence on the basis of time unevenness between maintaining a long term stiff position, in this case it deals with sitting at the computer, and between compensation movement activities. In today's highly technical period more higher demands are placed on employees, their numbers are reduced and this expands <b>filling</b> <b>work</b> of another workers. Workers are then forced to stay at one's own job even after regular working hours and they have less time and energy for a moving activity. The majority of workplaces are not arranged according to ergonomic principals, which also has an influence on development of already mentioned problems. In the theoretical section anatomy and kinesiology axial organ are gradually described, shoulders and lower limbs, further there is defined the issues of muscular imbalance. The third chapter {{is aimed at}} exercising methods founded by MUDr. Richard Smišek SM system (stable mobile system). Subsequently there is the defined concept of ergonomics focused on the ergonomics of sitting at the computer, the last chapter discusses posture. The main aim of this work was the discovery of muscle imbalance at administrative workers on the basis of kinesiology entrance examination and subsequently the effort to influence the imbalance with the help of exercising SM system. The method option for the practical part of work was by quality research. Collecting data took place in the form of interviews with direct revocation anamnesis from three probands from the ranks of administrative workers; subsequently a kinesiology examination was accomplished at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the research. Probands got a questionnaire about ergonomic arrangement of their work place and were asked to fill in the informed consent. The bachelor work can be used for professional and amateur public, for specifically improving knowledge about exercising the SM system method and about the considerable meaning of ergonomics not only at sitting employees...|$|E

The burin produces a unique and recognizable quality of line that is characterized by its steady, deliberate appearance and clean edges. The angle tint tool has a slightly curved tip that is commonly used in printmaking. Florentine liners are flat-bottomed tools with multiple lines incised into them, used to do <b>fill</b> <b>work</b> on larger areas or to create uniform shade lines that are fast to execute. Ring gravers are made with particular shapes that are used by jewelry engravers in order to cut inscriptions inside rings. Flat gravers are used for <b>fill</b> <b>work</b> on letters, as well as [...] "wriggle" [...] cuts on most musical instrument engraving work, remove background, or create bright cuts. Knife gravers are for line engraving and very deep cuts. Round gravers, and flat gravers with a radius, are commonly used on silver to create bright cuts (also called bright-cut engraving), as well as other hard-to-cut metals such as nickel and steel. Square or V-point gravers are typically square or elongated diamond-shaped and used for cutting straight lines. V-point can be anywhere from 60 to 130 degrees, depending on purpose and effect. These gravers have very small cutting points. Other tools such as mezzotint rockers, roulets and burnishers are used for texturing effects. Burnishing tools can also be used for certain stone setting techniques.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the merits of}} a robot at the community pharmacy in a quasi-experiment. Method: The applied methods for data-collection were barcode-time measurements, direct observations, time-interval studies, and tally at a Dutch community pharmacy. The topics consisted of workload, waiting times, congestion, slack, general work, counter work, and work at the consultation room. The topics were studied in pre-test and post-test stages, each stage during six weeks. By using these topics and some additional data from the pharmacy, {{the economics of the}} robot were also assessed. Results: The workload decreased with 15 prescriptions per person per day. The waiting times decreased with one minute and 18 seconds per dispensing process, reducing the wait until counter contact. The day congestion decreased with one hour 27 minutes and 36 seconds, and the day slack increased with 28 minutes. The analysis of the general work showed no appreciable difference in the bulk of the care-related activities and the other activities. However, some work was re-shuffled: 7 % increase at counter work and 7 % decrease at logistics. Moreover, statistically significant increases were observed at counter work (5 %) and robot work (4 %), and significant decreases at telephone (3 %) and <b>filling</b> <b>work</b> in presence of the patient (4 %). The counter tally study showed a rise in care-related activities with 8 %. Moreover, it also illuminated a statistically significant decrease at no information (11 %) and an increase at only social (2 %). The consultation room was never used during the study. The pharmacy economics of the robot showed that the robot had high estimated costs for purchase, depreciation, and maintenance: EUR 187, 024 in the first year. Moreover, the robot had positive impact on waiting times, congestion, staffing, logistics, and care-related work, which was estimated on EUR 91, 198 in the first year. The estimated payback time of the robot was three years. Conclusions: An introduction of the robot may indeed have the often supposed positive effects on pharmaceutical care. Even though the costs are high and the technical problems are present, the robot seems to be financial beneficial after three years. The robot can create space for pharmaceutical care, but it has a substantial cost...|$|E
