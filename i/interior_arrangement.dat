25|$|The Onias {{temple was}} not exactly similar to the Temple at Jerusalem, being more {{in the form of}} a high tower; and as regards the <b>interior</b> <b>arrangement,</b> it had not a candelabrum, but a hanging lamp. The {{building}} had a court (τέμενος) which was surrounded by a brick wall with stone gates. The king endowed the temple with large revenues—a fact that may have suggested to the writer of the letters mentioned above the wealth of wood and sacrificial animals.|$|E

Built as a scaled-up neo-Baroque [...] pavilion entered through an Ionic portico recessed between massive rusticated piers in antis, its <b>interior</b> <b>arrangement</b> {{and the use of}} round-headed windows on its sides were patterned after the Bevis Marks and Lauderdale Road Synagogues in London. Ohel Rachel's cavernous sanctuary, overlooked by a second floor with wide balconies, has a capacity of 700 people. Its walk-in ark, which held 30 Torah scrolls, was flanked by marble pillars. The facility also included a library, ritual bath (mikveh), and playground. Ohel Rachel is the largest synagogue in the Far East and is described as [...] "second to none in the East".|$|E

50|$|Thompson's {{interest}} in modernism was balanced by appreciation of older architecture. In the late 1950s, he renovated Harvard Yard's historic dormitories by updating their <b>interior</b> <b>arrangements</b> without visible exterior effect.

2500|$|The 737 <b>interior</b> <b>arrangement</b> {{has changed}} in {{successive}} generations. The original 737 interior was restyled for the 737 Classic models using 757 designs, while 777 architecture {{was used for the}} debut of the Next Generation 737. Designed using Boeing's new cabin concepts, the latest Sky Interior features sculpted sidewalls and redesigned window housings, along with increased headroom and LED mood lighting. Larger pivot-bins similar to those on the 777 and 787 have more luggage space than prior designs. The Sky Interior is also designed to improve cabin noise levels by 2–4 dB. The first 737 equipped with the Boeing Sky Interior was delivered to Flydubai in late 2010. Continental Airlines, [...] Malaysia Airlines, and TUIFly have also received Sky Interior-equipped 737s.|$|E
2500|$|Despite their proximity, the {{two towers}} differ greatly in construction, a {{difference}} that {{extends to the}} breastwork as well, pointing to a construction at different dates. The southern tower is an irregularly quadrilateral two-story structure. Its masonry is very uneven, including several stone pillars that have been inserted into it, often not fully, and its counterfort is made of small, irregularly fitted stones. Its <b>interior</b> <b>arrangement,</b> with its spacious upper story, large windows, and westward-facing balcony, suggests a use as a residential tower. Combined, these factors strongly support its traditional identification with the so-called Tower of Isaac Angelos: according to the historian Niketas Choniates, that tower was built by Emperor Isaac II Angelos (r. 1185–1195, 1203–1204) both as a fort and a private residence, and made use of materials from ruined churches. In contrast, the northern tower, which is identified as the Tower of Anemas proper, is a carefully built structure, displaying the typically Byzantine alternating layers of stone masonry and bricks. Its buttress is built of large, regular, carefully fitted blocks. The strength of {{the walls and the}} buttresses is explained by considering that this structure formed the westernmost retaining wall of the large terraced hill upon which the late Byzantine Palace of Blachernae was built.|$|E

I do not answer for the thickness and external disposition of the walls, which are not to our present purpose, and which I have not carefully examined; but the <b>interior</b> <b>arrangement</b> is given with sufficient accuracy. The church is built on the usual plan of the Basilica[5] that is to say, its body divided into a nave and aisles by two rows of massive shafts, {{the roof of the}} nave being raised high above the aisles by walls sustained on two ranks of pillars, and pierced with small arched windows. At Torcello the aisles are also lighted in the same manner, and the nave is nearly twice their breadth.[6] ...|$|E
50|$|Early temples {{were often}} timber, and little trace remains, {{although}} stone was increasingly used. Cave temples {{such as those}} at Ajanta have survived better and preserve the plan form, porch and <b>interior</b> <b>arrangements</b> from this early period. As {{the functions of the}} monastery-temple expanded, the plan form started to diverge from the Hindu tradition and became more elaborate, providing sleeping, eating and study accommodation.|$|R

60|$|I {{suspect that}} the <b>interior</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the choir and the chancel has been greatly modernized; for it is quite unlike {{anything}} that I have seen elsewhere. Instead of one vast eastern window, there are rows of windows lighting the Lady Chapel, and seen through rows of arches in the screen of the chancel; the effect being, whoever {{is to have the}} credit of it, very rich and beautiful. There is, I think, no stained glass in the windows of the nave, though in the windows of the chancel there is some of recent date, and from fragments of veritable antique. The effect of the whole interior is grand, expansive, and both ponderous and airy; not dim, mysterious, and involved, as Gothic interiors often are, the roundness and openness of the arches being opposed to this latter effect.|$|E
60|$|This prince {{owed the}} {{establishment}} of his government, against the claims of his elder brother, {{as well as those}} of other competitors, to the arms and influence of the British East India Company. Being thus established in a considerable part of the dominions he now possesses, he began, about the year 1765, to form, at the instigation (as he asserts) of the servants of the East India Company, a variety of designs for the further extension of his territories. Some years after, he carried his views to certain objects of <b>interior</b> <b>arrangement,</b> of a very pernicious nature. None of these designs could be compassed without the aid of the Company's arms; nor could those arms be employed consistently with an obedience to the Company's orders. He was therefore advised to form a more secret, but an equally powerful, interest among the servants of that Company, and among others both at home and abroad. By engaging them in his interests, the use of the Company's power might be obtained without their ostensible authority; the power might even be employed in defiance of the authority, if the case should require, as in truth it often did require, a proceeding of that degree of boldness.|$|E
6000|$|But, {{to say the}} truth, the {{spectacle}} struck me rather ludicrously, to see this party of stout middle-aged and elderly gentlemen, in the fulness of meat and drink, their ample and ruddy faces glistening with wine, perspiration, and enthusiasm, rumbling out those strange old stanzas from {{the very bottom of}} their hearts and stomachs, which two organs, in the English <b>interior</b> <b>arrangement,</b> lie closer together than in ours. The song seemed to me the rudest old ditty in the world; but I could not wonder at its universal acceptance and indestructible popularity, considering how inimitably it expresses the national faith and feeling as regards the inevitable righteousness of England, the Almighty's consequent respect and partiality for that redoubtable little island, and his presumed readiness to strengthen its defence against the contumacious wickedness and knavery of all other principalities or republics. Tennyson himself, though evidently English to the very last prejudice, could not write half so good a song for the purpose. Finding that the entire dinner-table struck in, with voices of every pitch between rolling thunder and the squeak of a cart-wheel, and that the strain was not of such delicacy as to be much hurt by the harshest of them, I determined to lend my own assistance in swelling the triumphant roar. It seemed but a proper courtesy to the first Lady in the land, whose guest, in the largest sense, I might consider myself. Accordingly, my first tuneful efforts (and probably my last, for I purpose not to sing any more, unless it he [...] "Hail Columbia" [...] on the restoration of the Union) were poured freely forth in honor of Queen Victoria. The Sergeant smiled like the carved head of a Swiss nutcracker, and the other gentlemen in my neighborhood, by nods and gestures, evinced grave approbation of so suitable a tribute to English superiority; and we finished our stave and sat down in an extremely happy frame of mind.|$|E

50|$|In the 13th century, {{the castle}} {{was held by}} the Cardaillac family. The edifice has a H-shaped plan, {{following}} various additions to the original central square tower. A second tower is discernible to the north, as well as traces of medieval openings. The cellar level, half underground, still has many remains from this period.

When the building was completed, a Mr Clarke was identified as the contractor, with the cost of construction £8000. The building was advertised in December 1866 as ready for occupation from 1 January 1867. Shortly after, the building was described as, [...] "...substantially built, possessing an imposing exterior presence, and the <b>interior</b> <b>arrangements</b> contain all the requisites of a well-finished dwelling house of the mother-country, combined with the protection required by a warm climate...".|$|R

It was {{acquired}} in 1796 by Daniel Marrett, a Harvard College graduate who moved to Standish to become the town parson. The house he purchased reflected his status as the community's leading citizen. Over the years, Marrett's children and grandchildren enlarged and updated the house but left many furnishings and <b>interior</b> <b>arrangements</b> unchanged as relics of the past. They preserved the southwest parlor exactly as it had appeared {{on the occasion of}} a family wedding in 1847. In 1889, the family celebrated the house's centennial by refurbishing several of the rooms with reproduction heirloom wallpapers and bed hangings, and organizing a large family reunion to honor the Marrett legacy.|$|R
5000|$|After the divorce, Ryan {{consolidated}} her holdings, {{buying up}} land in Palmerston and taking on several mining leases. As the economy cooled, Ryan {{decided to build}} a hotel in 1888. Her plans were stalled after sustaining a serious injury falling from her horse, which kicked her in the head. But two years later she succeeded in building a prestigious two-storey hotel in Palmerston which was first named the Royal, but was changed to the North Australian at the last minute. It was eventually named the Victoria Hotel.

Below was the great banqueting-hall, and beyond this the chamber where the king heard complaints and administered justice. Leading from this were the king and queen's private chambers, where the one sat and read or received his chief councillors, and the other worked with her maids, and listened to the music of the harpers or the tales of war and love sung by bards.|$|R

5000|$|Redpath is {{probably}} {{best known for her}} still lifes where familiar household objects - a chair, a cup - are made into a [...] "two-dimensional" [...] design. She used textiles - a printed tablecloth, a spotted scarf - to add pattern within the pattern. The Indian Rug, also known as Red Shoes, {{is a good example of}} this group of paintings. Matisse's influence is clear in these bold, flat-surfaced <b>interior</b> <b>arrangements.</b> Critics see another influence in the tabletops tilted to suit the design, not conventional perspective: that of the medieval Sienese paintings which impressed her on her first trip abroad. At this time she first discovered the richness of Catholic imagery (unfamiliar to a young woman brought up as a Scottish Protestant), a theme explored in her later work.|$|R

They form the outer skin of the ship, and are fastened to the ribs, keel, stem-post, and stern-post by means of innumerable pins of wood or iron, called tree-nails. The spaces between the planks are caulked--that is, stuffed with oakum; which substance is simply the untwisted tow of old and tarry ropes. A figure-head of some ornamental kind having {{been placed on the}} top and front of the stem-post, just above the cutwater, and a flat, ornamental stern, with windows in it to light the cabin, the hull of our ship is complete.
