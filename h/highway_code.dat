40|$|<b>Highway</b> <b>Codes</b> {{comprise}} {{signs and}} symbols mounted or {{drawn on the}} roads or road sides, and they form important aspects of road descriptions. These signs and symbols are usually the combination of linguistic and non-linguistic elements, used {{for the purpose of}} giving specific instructions and information to road users, with the aim of avoiding incidences of collision of activities on the roads in the course of usage and ultimately, to prevent road mishaps. However, it is discovered that negligence on the part of road users has reduced <b>Highway</b> <b>Codes</b> to mere decorations. Also, it is noted that many road users often assume that they are familiar with the art of driving, and know the roads well enough. Thus, they are nonchalant with driving and pay little or no attention to the <b>Highway</b> <b>Codes,</b> which to them, especially the commercial drivers, in Nigeria, are just mere road adornment. Consequently, the objective of this research is to identify selected Nigeria <b>Highway</b> <b>Codes</b> and analyse the components; especially, the non-linguistic sign sand symbols used as signifiers of specific information about road usages. It also examines the communication components identified in the <b>Highway</b> <b>Codes</b> to show the synergy between the signs and the linguistic imprints and how they all correlate to make communication effective. Using semiotic approach, this work discusses the <b>Highway</b> <b>Codes,</b> as signifiers, which control the psychology of the road users and make the interchange of roles effective among them.

25|$|Road {{signs in}} Singapore closely follow those {{laid down in}} the traffic sign {{regulations}} used in the United Kingdom, although a number of changes {{over the years have}} introduced some slight deviations that suit local road conditions (such as fonts).

25|$|In Germany, right {{turns on}} red are only permitted, after a {{complete}} stop, when a specific sign is present. This rule {{was first introduced}} in 1978 in East Germany and was originally supposed to become obsolete together with the East German <b>highway</b> <b>code</b> {{by the end of}} 1990, following German reunification. However, authorities were unable to remove the signs in time, and public opinion caused them to leave the regulation unchanged, even extending its scope to the former areas of West Germany in 1994. By 1999, there were 300 turn-on-red intersections on the territory of the former West Germany while that of the former East Germany featured 2,500. However, the numbers in the former West Germany have risen considerably since then and as of 2002 a total of 5,000 turn-on-red intersections were counted, representing 48% of the national total.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} get into the male psyche, they spend a day at Walthamstow Stadium dog track and {{subsequently}} decide to invent six rules of fashion for men based on the way that the betting information is arranged. The six basic body shapes include man boobs, beer belly, short legs, thick neck, broad shoulders and skinny. With each body shape, there includes a list of clothing items men must avoid, and others that are suitable. To test out the rules, Trinny and Susannah travel to a Cumbrian slate mine for the miners to take the rules and go shopping on their own. After the trial, they fear the rules are not simple enough. They seek the help from an advertising company who come {{up with the idea of}} arranging the six rules in the form of the <b>Highway</b> <b>Code,</b> therefore renaming the rules The Male Dress Code. Meanwhile, the fashion duo have arranged for the male section of an Oxford Street department store to be sectioned off to allow a male only day. The section has the six important rules displayed, complete with six live male manikins, one for each body shape, to demonstrate the clothing rules. They also invite some of the civil engineers and slate miners to test the newly formatted rules. Then outside of the store, Trinny and Susannah unveil the six male manikins in the shop window to the women outside.|$|E

500|$|Following the Beatles' {{break-up}} on 10 April 1970, {{and having}} long discussed {{the possibility of}} recording a solo album of his songs, Harrison committed to the project over dinner at Friar Park with Boyd, O'Dell and Terry Doran, his friend and temporary estate manager. The following month, Harrison performed a selection of his compositions in London for Phil Spector, his co-producer on All Things Must Pass, {{one of which was}} [...] "Everybody, Nobody". With its reference to roads and the UK's <b>Highway</b> <b>Code,</b> [...] "Everybody, Nobody" [...] has been described by musical biographer Simon Leng as Harrison's first [...] "motoring" [...] song. Harrison soon completely rewrote the lyrics and took part of the melody for his first musical tribute to Crisp and Friar Park – titled [...] "Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)". The result, in Leng's opinion, was a signpost to its composer's future involvement in film, an interest that, like gardening and motorsport, would flourish in a dwelling that offered [...] "privacy without imprisonment".|$|E

2500|$|Strict {{liability}} can {{be described}} as criminal or civil liability notwithstanding the lack mens rea or intent by the defendant. [...] Not all crimes require specific intent, and the threshold of culpability required may be reduced or demoted.

In offenses of absolute liability, other than the prohibited act, it may not be necessary to show the act was intentional. Generally, crimes must include an intentional act, and [...] "intent" [...] is an element that must be proved in order to find a crime occurred. [...] The idea of a [...] "strict liability crime" [...] is an oxymoron. [...] The few exceptions are not truly crimes at all – but are administrative regulations and civil penalties created by statute, such as crimes against the traffic or <b>highway</b> <b>code.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{regards to}} civil rights, the Brandt Administration {{introduced}} {{a broad range}} of socially liberal reforms aimed at making West Germany a more open society. Greater legal rights for women were introduced, as exemplified by the standardisation of pensions, divorce laws, regulations governing use of surnames, and the introduction of measures to bring more women into politics. The voting age was lowered from 21 to 18, the age of eligibility for political office was lowered to 21, and the age of majority was lowered to 18 in March 1974. The Third Law for the Liberalization of the Penal Code (1970) liberalised [...] "the right to political demonstration", while equal rights were granted to illegitimate children that same year. A 1971 amendment to a federal civil service reform bill enabled fathers to apply for part-time civil service work. [...] In 1971, corporal punishment was banned in schools, and that same year a new <b>Highway</b> <b>Code</b> was introduced. In 1973, a measure was introduced that facilitated the adoption of young children by reducing the minimum age for adoptive parents from 35 to 25.|$|E
