60|$|Coming {{upon this}} {{ground of the}} civil list, the first thing in dignity and charge that attracts our notice is the royal household. This establishment, in my opinion, is {{exceedingly}} abusive in its constitution. It is formed upon manners and customs that have long since expired. In the first place, it is formed, in many respects, upon feudal principles. In the feudal times, it was not uncommon, even among subjects, for the lowest offices to be held by considerable persons,--persons as unfit by their incapacity as improper from their rank to occupy such employments. They were held by patent, sometimes for life, and sometimes by inheritance. If my memory does not deceive me, a person of no slight consideration held the office of patent hereditary cook to an Earl of Warwick: the Earl of Warwick's soups, I fear, were not the better for the dignity of his kitchen. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> Earl of Gloucester who officiated as steward of the household to the Archbishops of Canterbury. Instances {{of the same kind}} may in some degree be found in the Northumberland house-book, and other family records. There was some reason in ancient necessities for these ancient customs. Protection was wanted; and the domestic tie, though not the highest, was the closest.|$|E

Instances {{of the same kind}} may in some degree be found in the Northumberland house-book, and other family records. There was some reason in ancient necessities, for these ancient customs. Protection was wanted; and the domestic tie, thought not the highest, was the closest. The king's household has not only several strong traces of this FEUDALITY, but it is formed also upon the principles of a BODY CORPORATE; it has its own magistrates, courts, and by-laws. This might be necessary in the ancient times, {{in order to have a}} government within itself, capable of regulating the vast and often unruly multitude which composed and attended it. This was the origin of the ancient court called the GREEN CLOTH--composed of the marshal, treasurer, and other great officers of the household, with certain clerks. The rich subjects of the kingdom who had formerly the same establishments (only on a reduced scale) have since altered their economy; and turned the course of their expense from the maintenance of vast establishments within their walls, to the employment of a great variety of independent trades abroad. Their influence is lessened; but a mode of accommodation, and a style of splendour, suited to the manners of the times, has been increased. Royalty itself has insensibly followed; and the royal household has been carried away by the resistless tide of manners: but with this very material difference;--private men have got rid of the establishments along with the reasons of them; whereas the royal household has lost all that was stately and venerable in the antique manners, without retrenching anything of the cumbrous charge of a Gothic establishment. It is shrunk into the polished littleness of modern elegance and personal accommodation; it has evaporated from the gross concrete into an essence and rectified spirit of expense, where you have tuns of ancient pomp in a vial of modern luxury.|$|E

[...] Force India deputy team principal Bob Fernleyon the decision not to take part in the second Friday practice session. On 18 April, former McLaren mechanic turned journalist Marc Priestley took to Twitter to report that a hire car used by Force India mechanics had been involved in a petrol bombing, though there were no injuries or damage. The team members had been travelling in an unmarked car and were held up by an impromptu roadblock which they were unable to clear before a petrol bomb exploded nearby. Further reports of the incident indicated that the mechanics were briefly exposed to tear gas fired by security forces on the protesters. One of the team members involved in the incident flew out of the country the next day. The mechanic — who was not named — chose to leave as he no longer felt comfortable in the country. A second mechanic left several hours later. Force India driver Nico Hülkenberg was disturbed by the chain of events, quoted as saying that it was [...] "not right" [...] that team members should have to fear for their personal safety.|$|E
5000|$|Hernández {{signed to}} play Canelita, the gay best friend of Cheba (Adriana Paz) in La Tirisia, a film written, {{produced}} {{and directed by}} Jorge Pérez Solano (2014). The plot, inspired by a popular term named tirisia (which means [...] "a perpetual sadness defined as 'the death of the spirit'"), {{is set in the}} Mixteca region of Mexico, and centers on two women (Paz and Gabriela Cartol) who were impregnated by Sylvestre (Gustavo Sánchez Parra). When Cheba's estranged husband returns to town, he finds her sunk into a deep depression since she had to give away a newborn (Sylvestre's child). Hernández was hesitant to take the role and the preparation was not easy for the director either, as he further explained to Cine Toma magazine: [...] "I was pleased that an actor like Noé Hernández, who suddenly was falling into the stereotype of the tough, strong, bully, bad Indian man, agreed to play this role. It took some work from both of us at first. For me, to accept him physically and for him to accept the character and built it, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> experiment that tourned out pretty well". Hernández said to El Universal: [...] "the director told me: you wanted an acting challenge and acting to stop doing the same violent roles, this is it, take it". The film was not exhibited on commercial movie theaters in Mexico since the distribution was expensive; instead, La Tirisia was screened at film festivals such as the Chicago International Film Festival, Thessaloniki International Film Festival and Toulouse Latin American Film Festival, and later had a month-and-a-half exhibition at the Mexican art house Cineteca Nacional.Hernández received critical praise for his performance. Jaime López Blanco of Sputnik magazine found him [...] "exquisite as 'Canelita', as it demonstrates his charm and his comedic talents, showing a totally opposite of his previous work, Miss Bala". At the Ariel Awards of 2015, Hernández received the Best Supporting Actor accolade for the role in the film. After winning the award the actor struggled to find new roles, considered retiring from acting and return to his hometown to work in the country fields, explaining to El Informador: [...] "Of course I'm delighted, who does not like to win awards? The awards are ego boosters, but what I really want is that they can be transformed into stronger work opportunities and complex characters, good roles, and lead roles. This year I only had five-day calls for little characters; the award has not really helped me a lot, let's hope it strengthens my career and leads to more opportunities". At the time, a project with director Nacho Ortíz fell through, and four other films co-starred by Hernández were not distributed in Mexico. [...] "Fortunately I'm not married, I have a son who I help moderately and every month I try to survive. Sometimes I say, 'I have income to pay rent for three months I can hold on a little', but then I start to worry and say 'time is running out and what can I do'. This situation has been quite difficult for me," [...] the actor told El Universal.|$|E
