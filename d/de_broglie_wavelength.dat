5|$|Since an {{electron}} behaves as a wave, {{at a given}} velocity it has a characteristic <b>de</b> <b>Broglie</b> <b>wavelength.</b> This is given by λe=h/p where h is the Planck constant and p is the momentum.

5|$|The {{electron}} microscope directs a focused {{beam of electrons}} at a specimen. Some electrons change their properties, such as movement direction, angle, and relative phase and energy as the beam interacts with the material. Microscopists can record these changes in the electron beam to produce atomically resolved images of the material. In blue light, conventional optical microscopes have a diffraction-limited resolution of about 200nm. By comparison, {{electron microscope}}s are limited by the <b>de</b> <b>Broglie</b> <b>wavelength</b> of the electron. This wavelength, for example, is equal to 0.0037nm for electrons accelerated across a 100,000-volt potential. The Transmission Electron Aberration-Corrected Microscope is capable of sub-0.05nm resolution, {{which is more than}} enough to resolve individual atoms. This capability makes the electron microscope a useful laboratory instrument for high resolution imaging. However, electron microscopes are expensive instruments that are costly to maintain.|$|E

25|$|Whether objects {{heavier than}} the Planck mass (about {{the weight of a}} large bacterium) have a <b>de</b> <b>Broglie</b> <b>wavelength</b> is {{theoretically}} unclear and experimentally unreachable; above the Planck mass a particle's Compton wavelength would be smaller than the Planck length and its own Schwarzschild radius, a scale at which current theories of physics may break down or need to be replaced by more general ones.|$|E
25|$|Neutrons, on {{the other}} hand, have no {{electric}} charge to cause repulsion, {{and are able to}} initiate a nuclear reaction at very low energies. In fact, at extremely low particle energies (corresponding, say, to thermal equilibrium at room temperature), the neutron's <b>de</b> <b>Broglie</b> <b>wavelength</b> is greatly increased, possibly greatly increasing its capture cross section, at energies close to resonances of the nuclei involved. Thus low-energy neutrons may be even more reactive than high energy neutrons.|$|E

25|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopes {{are capable}} of imaging at a significantly higher resolution than light microscopes, owing to the smaller <b>de</b> <b>Broglie</b> <b>wavelength</b> of electrons. This enables the instrument to capture fine detail—even {{as small as a}} single column of atoms, which is thousands of times smaller than a resolvable object seen in a light microscope.

25|$|At the time, {{electrons}} were {{understood to}} be charged particles of matter; the wave nature of electrons was not fully realized until {{the publication of the}} De Broglie hypothesis in 1927. The research group was unaware of this publication until 1932, when they quickly realized that the <b>De</b> <b>Broglie</b> <b>wavelength</b> of electrons was many orders of magnitude smaller than that for light, theoretically allowing for imaging at atomic scales. In April 1932, Ruska suggested {{the construction of a new}} electron microscope for direct imaging of specimens inserted into the microscope, rather than simple mesh grids or images of apertures. With this device successful diffraction and normal imaging of an aluminium sheet was achieved. However the magnification achievable was lower than with light microscopy. Magnifications higher than those available with a light microscope were achieved in September 1933 with images of cotton fibers quickly acquired before being damaged by the electron beam.|$|E

Quantum mechanical properties of the electron include an intrinsic angular momentum (spin) of a half-integer value, expressed in units of the reduced Planck constant, ħ. As it is a fermion, no two electrons can occupy the same quantum state, in accordance with the Pauli exclusion principle. Like all elementary particles, electrons exhibit properties of both particles and waves: they can collide with other particles and can be diffracted like light.
