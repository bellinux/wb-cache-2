5|$|Alterations in the {{autonomic}} {{nervous system}} can lead to orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing), oily skin and excessive sweating, urinary incontinence, and altered sexual function. Constipation and impaired stomach <b>emptying</b> (gastric dysmotility) can be severe enough to cause discomfort and even endanger health. Changes in perception may include an impaired sense of smell, disturbed vision, pain, and paresthesia (tingling and numbness). All of these symptoms can occur years before diagnosis of the disease.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{two-dimensional}} discrete element program (UDEC) {{is applied}} to simulate the dampi-ng effect of <b>empty</b> holes on blasting vibration. The {{results show that the}} peak particle velocity of monitoring point on the condition that there are <b>empty</b> holes between monitoring point and blast hole is less than that without <b>empty</b> holes. The factors which have impact on cushioning effect, such as the depth of <b>empty</b> hole, the diameter of <b>empty</b> hole, the distance between <b>empty</b> hole and blast hole and the rows of <b>empty</b> hole, are investigated numerically. It is found that the depth of <b>empty</b> hole has dominated influence on the damping effect and the damping effect on blasting vibration strengthens with the increment of the depth. The diameter of <b>empty</b> hole and the distance between <b>empty</b> hole and blast hole have slight influence on the damping effect. The increment of rows of <b>empty</b> hole can enhance the damping effect on blasting vibration as well.

5|$|In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration {{approved}} the drug exenatide (marketed as Byetta) {{for the management}} of type 2 diabetes. It is a synthetic version of a protein, exendin-4, derived from the Gila monster's saliva. In a three-year study with people with type 2 diabetes, exenatide led to healthy sustained glucose levels and progressive weight loss. The effectiveness is because the lizard protein is about 50% identical to glucagon-like peptide-1 analog (GLP-1), a hormone released from the human digestive tract that helps to regulate insulin and glucagon. The lizard protein remains effective much longer than the human hormone, helping diabetics keep their blood sugar levels under control. Exenatide slows the <b>emptying</b> of the stomach and causes a decrease in appetite, contributing to weight loss.|$|E

5|$|Sindhu {{was given}} the ever-full bowl of amrita (elixir of life) as a boon from the Sun-god. The demon was warned that he could drink from the bowl {{as long as it}} was intact.

Gunesha defeated Sindhu's army, cut his general Kamalasura into three pieces and then cut open Sindhu's body, <b>emptying</b> the amrita bowl and thus killing the demon. The creator-god Brahma is described as having built the Morgaon shrine, and marrying Siddhi and Buddhi to Ganesha. At the end of this incarnation, Gunesha returned to his celestial abode, giving his peacock mount to his younger brother Skanda, with whom the peacock mount is generally associated.|$|E

5|$|It {{appears that}} the most benefit from {{activated}} charcoal is gained if it is given within 30 minutes to two hours of ingestion.

Activated charcoal should also be administered if co-ingested drugs warrant decontamination. There was reluctance to give activated charcoal in paracetamol overdose, because of the concern that it may also absorb the oral antidote acetylcysteine. Studies have shown that 39% less acetylcysteine is absorbed into the body when they are administered together. There are conflicting recommendations regarding whether to change the dosing of oral acetylcysteine after the administration of activated charcoal, and even whether the dosing of acetylcysteine needs to be altered at all.
