He wrote of regular visits to brothels, the first when he was 15, and said he was visiting them daily from the age of around 17.

25|$|In one study, {{psychiatric}} {{patients were}} found to have a statistically significant higher prevalence rate (55 percent) of reported bestiality, both actual sexual contacts (45 percent) and sexual fantasy (30 percent) than the control groups of medical in-patients (10 percent) and psychiatric staff (15 percent). Crépault and Couture (1980) reported that 5.3 percent of the men they surveyed had fantasized about sexual activity with an animal during heterosexual intercourse. In a 2014 study, 3% of women and 2.2% of men reported <b>fantasies</b> <b>about</b> having sex with an animal.

25|$|Sexual arousal from {{watching}} animals mate {{is known as}} faunoiphilia. A frequent interest in and sexual excitement at watching animals mate is cited {{as an indicator of}} latent zoophilia by Massen (1994). Sexual <b>fantasies</b> <b>about</b> zoophilic acts can occur in people who do not have any wish to experience them in real life. Nancy Friday notes that zoophilia as a fantasy may provide an escape from cultural expectations, restrictions, and judgements in regard to sex. Masters (1962) says that some brothel madams used to stage exhibitions of animals mating, as they found it aroused potential clientele, and that this may have encouraged the clients to engage in bestiality..|$|E
25|$|Juliet is {{diagnosed}} with tuberculosis and {{is sent to}} a clinic. Again her parents leave the country, leaving her alone and desperately missing Pauline.

After four months, Juliet is released from the clinic and their relationship intensifies. Juliet's father blames the intensity of the relationship on Pauline and speaks to her parents, who take her to a doctor. The doctor suspects that Pauline is homosexual, and considers this a cause of her increasing anger at her mother as well as her dramatic weight loss.|$|E

During the time when Hazumu and her friends go to the beach, Asuta continuously tries to remind himself that even though Hazumu's body has changed, the person is still the same, and as her best friend, {{he should not be}} thinking about her in a sexual way. Hazumu remains oblivious to the fact throughout the series that Asuta has been often thinking about her in a sexual way. Asuta continues to have <b>fantasies</b> <b>about</b> having Hazumu as a girlfriend as well. Overtime, Asuta realizes that Hazumu and him gradually grow apart from each other, or are at least not as close as they once had been when Hazumu was a boy. He does find it excellent that his friend is now a very attractive girl, but only wants to continue being Hazumu's friend and nothing more, constantly beating himself up for having impure thoughts about Hazumu.

25|$|In 1912 Spielrein {{married the}} Russian Jewish {{physician}} Pavel Nahumovitch Sheftel. They moved to Berlin, where Spielrein worked alongside Karl Abraham. Spielrein {{had her first}} daughter Irma-Renata (known as Renata), in 1913. While in Berlin, Spielrein published nine further papers. One of these was an account of children’s beliefs about sex and reproduction, in which she included recollections of her own early <b>fantasies</b> <b>about</b> this. Entitled 'Contribution to the Understanding of a Child's Soul', it shows her in more Freudian mode than her previous papers. In another paper, entitled, ‘The Mother-in-Law’, she gave a sympathetic account {{of the role of}} mothers-in-law and the relationship between them, their daughters-in-law. The Dutch psychoanalyst van Waning has commented on this paper: ”Women’s studies – in the year 1913!”. Another paper from the time recounts her treatment of a child with a phobia of animals, {{and is one of the}} first known reports of child psychotherapy At the outbreak of World War I, she returned to Switzerland, living briefly in Zurich again before relocating to Lausanne, where she and Renate remained for the rest of the war. Her husband joined his regiment in Kiev, and they were not reunited for more than a decade. The war years were times of privation for Spielrein: she did some work as a surgeon and in an eye clinic, but also received contributions from her parents when they could get these to her. She did however manage to publish two more short papers during the war years. She composed music, and considered becoming a composer. She also began to write a novel in French. She recorded observations of her daughter's development in terms of language and play. She continued her correspondence with Freud and Jung, and to evolve her own theoretical ideas, particularly in relation to attachment in children.|$|E

500|$|The film {{alternates}} between {{color and}} black and white sequences. Black and white usually denotes that the scene involves {{one or more of}} the hustlers engaged with a client, and indicates that {{one or more of the}} characters (not necessarily the client) is fantasizing. But the scheme is not always consistent: for example, when Dean has sex with the paralyzed client the scene is in color; and Harry also has an S/M scene that's all in color (although his client never appears on-screen). Equally, Harry's <b>fantasies</b> <b>about</b> [...] "Lovely Girl" [...] (who is apparently dead) are occasionally in color. In their final scene, Harry and Dean are in black and white, but when the client and Ghislaine are shown watching they're in color, raising the question of exactly who is having the fantasy. According to Lewis, the convention grew out of the fact that the initial improvised sequences were shot in black and white; he acknowledges that by the end the distinction had become [...] "very confused." ...|$|E

[...] Hayward, who said that her own response to Todd's redemption was ambivalent, called the writers' attempt to redeem Todd controversial and stated {{that the role of}} Rebecca, the woman the writers paired Todd with during the redemption process, [...] "seems to encourage both female and male <b>fantasies</b> <b>about</b> the power of a 'good woman' to save a man from his own violent impulses". [...] In his book Behold the Man, Edisol Dotson suggested that viewers accepted Todd's redemption because he was physically attractive.

Richards also discusses the motif of April's paper dolls, saying that April can relate to them as in different places, she is [...] "still the same person", but that she is [...] "coloured in differently by different people and different surroundings".
