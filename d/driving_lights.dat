25|$|The 2016 Indian Dark Horse was {{introduced}} on Valentine's Day 2015. It {{is based on}} a Chief Classic painted in flat black, with the <b>driving</b> <b>lights,</b> oil cooler, analog fuel gauge, passenger pillion seat and passenger pegs removed.|$|E
25|$|Nissan {{unveiled}} the Nissan Leaf Aero Style concept {{car at the}} 2011 Tokyo Auto Salon. The Leaf Aero Style exterior has a new front bumper, extended side skirts, restyled mirrors, LED daytime <b>driving</b> <b>lights,</b> and special wheels.|$|E
25|$|The updated Avalanches {{with some}} of the Z Series {{upgrades}} can be externally visually differentiated from the Y Series versions by their re-profiled front bumper unit that looks less aggressive and which features a more integrated appearance to the auxiliary <b>driving</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|E
50|$|PFM mode is {{a common}} {{technique}} for increasing the efficiency of switching step down DC-DC converters (Buck Converters) when <b>driving</b> <b>light</b> loads.|$|R

40|$|The group {{velocity}} of the probe light pulse (GVPLP) propagating through an open Lambda-type atomic system with a spontaneously generated coherence is investigated when the weak probe and strong <b>driving</b> <b>light</b> fields have different frequencies. It is found that adjusting the detuning or Rabi frequency of the probe light field can realize switching of the GVPLP from subluminal to superluminal. Changing the relative phase between the probe and <b>driving</b> <b>light.</b> elds or atomic exit and injection rates can lead to GVPLP varying in a wider range, but cannot induce transformation of {{the property of the}} GVPLP. The absolute value of the GVPLP always increases with Rabi frequency of the <b>driving</b> <b>light</b> field increasing. For subluminal and superluminal propagation, the system always exhibits the probe absorption, and GVPLP is mainly determined by the slope of the steep dispersion...|$|R
25|$|The base model's SOHC {{inline-four}} engine produced 95hp (71kW) {{and had a}} 9.1:1 compression ratio. The {{more powerful}} 1990–1991 GSi used a 1.6L DOHC engine that produced 130hp (97kW) and had a 9.8:1 compression ratio. The GSi package also included <b>driving</b> <b>lights,</b> a spoiler, a rear anti-sway bar, and a transmission with a gear ratio that was slightly better for acceleration than the base model's manual transmission.|$|E
25|$|The 1968 XT model {{featured}} a mild facelift, with a divided grille, and inset <b>driving</b> <b>lights</b> for the GT. The GT also replaced the thick lower body stripes of the XR with narrow stripes along the waistline from grille to tail light. The tail lights were still round, {{but instead of}} the small round indicator of the XR, the XT model had a long indicator across the light. Otherwise, all external body panels and bumpers {{were the same as}} the XR.|$|E
25|$|The GT's styling went wilder {{again with}} a 'Shaker' cold-air {{induction}} scoop protruding from {{a hole in the}} bonnet, which now sported twin wide GT stripes from grille to windscreen, rather than the bonnet blackouts of the XW. The thick side stripes remained, although altered slightly, as did the twin <b>driving</b> <b>lights</b> and blacked-out panel between the tail lights. Wheels were now the five-slot steel items first seen on the XW Phase II GT-HO. The Phase III GT-HO also sported a plastic front spoiler and a wild bootlid spoiler styled after those fitted to the Mach series Mustangs.|$|E
5000|$|Another, at {{the time}} minor, {{distinctive}} feature but this one did not catch-on was the centrally mounted light in the grille where most other manufacturers of good quality cars provided a pair, one fog and one <b>driving</b> <b>light</b> often separately mounted behind the bumper. Known, unkindly, as the [...] "Cyclops eye" [...] it was discontinued in the new grille announced 23 October 1952.|$|R
60|$|They had {{a little}} open phaeton for the journey, and were soon in it on the road home. Gowan, <b>driving,</b> <b>lighted</b> a cigar; Clennam {{declined}} one. Do what he would, he fell into such a mood of abstraction that Gowan said again, 'I am very much afraid my mother has bored you?' To which he roused himself to answer, 'Not at all!' and soon relapsed again.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the response of}} a polariton laser driven slightly off-resonantly using light fields differing from the routinely studied coherent pump sources. The response to <b>driving</b> <b>light</b> fields with thermal and displaced thermal statistics with varying correlation times shows {{significant differences in the}} transmitted intensity, its noise, and the position of the nonlinear threshold. We predict that adding more photons on average may actually reduce the transmission through the polariton system...|$|R
25|$|The {{top of the}} {{radiator}} was lowered 2 inches from the One-o-Four's. The styling of the Majestic is similar to, but wider and with smoother lines than the short lived Regency One-O-Four model it replaced. Interior width was increased by approximately 4 inches by extending the sides {{to the edge of}} the car. The handsome body is massive with a conventional high waistline —the doors later seemed to be high with narrow windows— and a rounded rear window. There are two standard-sized headlamps at the front extremities with Daimler's usual pair of fog lamps or <b>driving</b> <b>lights</b> just above low-set bumpers. There are plain disc wheels.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, {{inspired}} by a dominating 1–2 finish for Falcon hardtops at the 1977 Hardie Ferodo 1000, Ford introduced the limited-edition Cobra, which used the last 400 hardtop coupé bodyshells. Based on the Falcon GS Hardtop model, each Cobra was individually numbered and featured highlights such as Globe 15-in alloy road wheels copied from Ferrari intended to aid brake disc cooling, ER70 H15 radial-ply tyres, comprehensive instrumentation, bonnet scoops, <b>driving</b> <b>lights,</b> dual exhaust, four-wheel disc brakes, and a distinctive white and blue colour scheme. The 5.8-l engines were installed in cars numbered 002 to 199 and No 351, and the 4.9-litre engines were installed in the rest (001, plus 200 to 400 except for no. 351).|$|E
25|$|The GT variant {{kept the}} twin <b>driving</b> <b>lights,</b> but reverted to a bonnet {{blackout}} with no stripes {{at all on}} the vehicle. The front guards received fake 'vents' just behind the indicators, and NACA ducts were added to the bonnet. Steel 12-slot wheels were reintroduced, although some GTs received the five-spoke Globe 'Bathurst' wheels, which had been ordered for the GT-HO Phase IV and now needed to be used. The GT's rear suspension featured radius rods to help locate the elliptical-spring solid rear axle. Other performance parts from the aborted Phase IV found their way onto GTs, including larger fuel tanks and winged sumps. These GTs are generally referred to as RPO83s after the option code covering the additional parts, although what parts any given RPO83 received seem to have been governed by the luck of the draw rather than any specific process.|$|E
50|$|In {{medium to}} high loads, the DC {{resistance}} of buck converter switching elements tends {{to dominate the}} overall efficiency of the Buck Converter. When <b>driving</b> <b>light</b> loads, however, the effects of DC resistances are reduced and AC losses in the inductor, capacitor, and switching elements play {{a larger role in}} overall efficiency. This is especially true in discontinuous mode operation, in which the inductor current drops below zero, resulting in the discharging of the output capacitor and even higher switching losses.|$|R
5000|$|The terms harness {{horse and}} light harness horse refer to horses of a lighter build, such as {{traditional}} carriage horses and show horses, {{and are not}} terms generally used to denote [...] "heavy" [...] or draft horses. Harness horse breeds include heavy warmblood breeds such as the Oldenburg and Cleveland Bay, as well as lighter breeds such as the Hackney, and in some disciplines, such as combined <b>driving,</b> <b>light</b> riding breeds such as the Thoroughbred or Morgan may be seen.|$|R
40|$|In a Joint Center paper, Kleit and Lutter {{identify}} externalities {{of about}} $ 0. 08 per mile for <b>driving</b> <b>light</b> duty vehicles. Rather than recognize the huge externalities from current driving, {{they focus on}} a tiny increment that would come from increasing CAFE standards. A first best policy would tax congestion, pollution emissions and gasoline, and increase safety. If that policy is not politically feasible, a second best policy would increase gasoline taxes $ 1. 75 per gallon. Contrary to Kleit and Lutter, we find sound economic reasons for CAFE. ...|$|R
25|$|In the 2004 model year, the XG350 {{received}} larger front brakes (discs {{went from}} 10.9- to 12-inch), {{which in turn}} required a 16-inch spare tire as standard equipment, replacing the 'space-saver' design used since 2001. Also new this year were restyled front and rear bumpers, bodyside moldings, headlights (now with HID availability), <b>driving</b> <b>lights,</b> tail lamps, grille, and deck lid with recessed license plate holder. The high-mounted stop lamp in the rear window went to an all-new LED design. The interior wood-tone trim changed to a lighter shade, glove compartment and storage bins were now covered in charcoal gray material (formerly black), the door-mounted power window switch panels now matched the interior color (previously, they were high-gloss wood-tone), recessed seat tethers allowed for secure installation of child seats in all three rear seat positions, and the trunk hinges were now supported using hydraulic pistons. Standard equipment leather upholstery was available in solid deep charcoal or a two-tone finish featuring a tan interior with brown dashboard/center console and upper door trim. The L versions were equipped with specific 12-spoke silver-painted allow rims featuring center caps covering the lug nuts. Minor equipment changes inside included redesigned levers for the hood release and tilt steering column, an updated cruise control switch, a recessed trunk pull-down handle, and leather trim around the console armrest tray.|$|E
25|$|The FJ Crawler {{was first}} offered in 2007 (for the 2008 model year) {{and is the}} result of a {{collaboration}} between Dealer Services International (DSI), known for building high quality custom packages for new vehicle dealers, and ARB, who has a long history building rugged off-road products. For participating Toyota new vehicle dealerships, the FJ Crawler could be special ordered for customers who were looking for a vehicle that is even more rugged and off-road ready than a standard Off-Road Package factory option would provide. The FJ Crawler package included an ARB Front Bull Bar Bumper, an Old Man Emu 3-inch suspension lift to support the added weight of the ARB bumper and to allow for the 17-inch Pro Comp wheels with either 33 or 35-inch off-roading tires. The FJ Crawler was able to be customized in many ways with many optional accessories to achieve the customers satisfaction. For example, the FJ Crawler could be ordered in any factory color for the current model year. The customer could choose from 3 different wheel choices, 3 different tire choices, and could even choose the exact springs and shocks used in the Old Man Emu suspension to achieve the desired ride/performance quality. There was also the option of adding accessories such as a Warn winch, IFP <b>driving</b> <b>lights</b> which would be mounted to the ARB bumper, a fog light kit for the ARB bumper, and an ARB roof rack for storing gear and other items. Other options included a cat-back exhaust system, a high flow intake, as well as side steps. Also, because of variances in aftermarket tire sizes, speedometer calibration was provided to ensure correct vehicle speed and mileage are recorded.|$|E
2500|$|The Falcon Sundowner Van, {{based on}} the Falcon 500 Van, was {{introduced}} in 1977. It included options from the Falcon GS Hardtop, such as comprehensive instrumentation, bonnet scoops, slotted sports road wheels, and <b>driving</b> <b>lights,</b> but with bodyside protection mouldings and van side glass deleted. Side and rear decals {{were included in the}} package, as was the [...] "sedan ride" [...] 500-kg (10-cwt) suspension package and ER70 H14 radial-ply tyres.|$|E
50|$|The {{vehicle is}} {{equipped}} with an IR <b>driving</b> <b>light</b> and an IR searchlight. The searchlight {{was removed from the}} right side of the front of the superstructure, as the area there was used for the second projecting bay. It was instead fitted on the commander's cupola. It also has two mounts for shovels on either side of the front of the vehicle as well as two mounts for pickaxes on the left side of the superstructure. A stowage bucket is placed centrally in the front of the engine deck.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the topological phase transitions in graphene under the modulation of circularly polarized light, {{by analyzing the}} changes of edge states and its topological structures. A full phase diagram, with up to ten different topological phases, {{is presented in the}} parameter space spanned by the <b>driving</b> frequency and <b>light</b> strength. We find that the high-Chern number behavior is very common in the driven system. While the one-photon resonance can create the chiral edge states in the π-gap, the two-photon resonance will induce the counter-propagating edge modes in the zero-energy gap. When the <b>driving</b> <b>light</b> strength is strong, the number and even the chirality of the edge states may change in the π-gap. The robustness of the edge states to disorder potential are also examined. We close by discussing the feasibility of experimental proposals. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
2500|$|The GTA {{used the}} same uni-body as the two-door Alliances, but was {{distinctive}} to the other models. It was available only in silver, white, red, or black monochrome body paint with special color-keyed [...] "ground effects" [...] bodyside cladding styled by Zender of West Germany, one of Europe's leading after-market designers. It also featured 15-inch aluminum alloy sport wheels with low-profile Michelin Sport XGT 195-VR50 series tires, upgraded suspension with thicker sway bars, vented front disc brakes, larger exhaust pipe, optional <b>driving</b> <b>lights,</b> custom body moldings, a small spoiler on the rear trunk, red inlaid shift knob, close ratio gears on the manual transmission, stiffer engine mounts, larger brake booster, and special bolstered [...] "racing" [...] seats unique to the model. An automatic transmission was not available.|$|E
2500|$|For the 1976 {{auto show}} circuit, AMC {{developed}} a customized Pacer Stinger. The exterior featured a matte black painted lower body panels and yellow pearl paint that faded to a pale yellow on the roof. The back {{half of the}} car had over-the-roof matte black [...] "bumble bee stripes" [...] that continued on the tailgate. The Stinger was fitted with oversize radial tires mounted on Jackman Star (brand) aluminum racing road wheels, a side mounted exhaust, NACA duct on the hood, auxiliary Cibie (brand) <b>driving</b> <b>lights,</b> {{as well as a}} front spoiler and wheel well fender extensions. The Stinger's interior was in black with a floor-mounted shifter and front bucket seats with center console. Black and yellow stripes on the front and rear seats completed the [...] "bumble bee" [...] theme, while the black door panels had yellow side cushions.|$|E
2500|$|Power-assisted front {{disc brakes}} were now {{standard}} across the Falcon range. The GT {{variant of the}} XB also included four-wheel disc brakes (the earlier GT/GT-HO models used large finned drums at the rear). The first 211 XB GTs built were fitted with a US-built version of the Cleveland [...] V8 known as the 'big port' engine, and later XB GTs were fitted with an Australian-built version of the engine with 'small port' heads. A notable difference in performance is seen between these engines, and also in resale value, as the early US-powered GTs are rarer, so more collectable. The twin <b>driving</b> <b>lights</b> remained, as did the bonnet locks. The bonnet scoops of the GT were now integrated into the [...] "power bulge" [...] on the bonnet, the bumpers were now body-coloured, and the power bulge, wheel arches, sills, and valances were painted in a contrasting colour to the body colour (usually black, but dependent upon the actual body colour choice).|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{iron loss}} {{is a source}} of {{detuning}} in vector controlled induction motor drives if the classical rotor vector controller is used for decoupling. In fact, the field orientation will not be satisfied and the output torque will not truck the reference torque mostly used by Loss Model Controllers (LMCs). In addition, this component of loss, among others, may be excessive if the vector controlled induction motor is <b>driving</b> <b>light</b> loads. In this paper, the series iron loss model is used to develop a vector controller immune to iron loss effect and then an LMC to minimize the total power loss using the torque generated by the speed controller...|$|R
40|$|This Letter brings {{together}} two topics that, until now, {{have been the}} focus of intense but non-overlapping research efforts. The first concerns high harmonic generation in solids, which occurs when intense light field excites highly non-equilibrium electronic response in a semiconductor or a dielectric. The second concerns many-body dynamics in strongly correlated systems such as the Mott insulator. Here we show that high harmonic generation can be used to time-resolve ultrafast many-body dynamics associated with optically driven phase transition, with accuracy far exceeding one cycle of the <b>driving</b> <b>light</b> field. Our work paves the way for time-resolving highly non-equilibrium many body dynamics in strongly correlated systems, with few femtosecond accuracy...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of a mechanical resonator parametrically coupled to a driven dissipative quantum emitter in the ultra-strong coupling regime. We show that this regime is fully compatible with a semi-classical treatment, and we derive master equations for the emitter and the resonator. We show that the fluctuations of the driven emitter's population induce the non-symmetrical scattering of the mechanical quadratures. At long timescales, such scattering back-acts on the emitter, which eventually decouples from the <b>driving</b> <b>light.</b> This optical noise at the quantum limit is observable with {{state of the art}} hybrid devices.
