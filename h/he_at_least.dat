5|$|Sanders, a bachelor, died without {{knowledge}} of the award of a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his actions on 12 June 1917. The emergence of correspondence with his first Q-ship commander, A.D Blair, {{makes it clear that}} <b>he</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> knew of his VC prior to his death, even if he had not received it. In June 1918, Sanders' father received his son's VC and DSO from the Governor-General of New Zealand. Sander's VC, the only one awarded to a New Zealander serving in the navy, and DSO are on display at the Auckland War Memorial Museum.|$|E
5|$|Before going {{hunting the}} next day Bertilak proposes a bargain: he will give Gawain {{whatever}} he catches {{on the condition that}} Gawain give him whatever he might gain during the day. Gawain accepts. After Bertilak leaves, Lady Bertilak visits Gawain's bedroom and behaves seductively, but despite her best efforts he yields nothing but a single kiss in his unwillingness to offend her. When Bertilak returns and gives Gawain the deer he has killed, his guest gives a kiss to Bertilak without divulging its source. The next day the lady comes again, Gawain again courteously foils her advances, and later that day there is a similar exchange of a hunted boar for two kisses. She comes once more on the third morning, this time offering Gawain a gold ring as a keepsake. He gently but steadfastly refuses but she pleads that <b>he</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> take her belt, a girdle of green and gold silk which, the lady assures him, is charmed and will keep him from all physical harm. Tempted, as he may otherwise die {{the next day}}, Gawain accepts it, and they exchange three kisses. That evening, Bertilak returns with a fox, which he exchanges with Gawain for the three kisses – but Gawain says nothing of the girdle.|$|E
5|$|Emma asks Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) {{about the}} compass and he {{searches}} his records. He finds {{a card that}} supposedly says Michael Tillman purchased the compass, and gives Emma this name. The card is revealed to be blank. Michael is the garage mechanic, and tells Emma he can barely handle the garage let alone twins. Emma {{has no choice but}} to take Ava and Nicholas to Boston on Regina's orders, despite Henry's warnings that no one can leave Storybrooke. That evening as the three are leaving, the vehicle breaks down as they reach the city limits, prompting Emma to call for help. Moments later, Ava notices her compass working. Michael arrives in his tow truck, and Emma explains that <b>he</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> has to see his children, as she could not leave Henry after seeing the life he had. Seeing Ava and Nicholas face to face changes his mind, and Michael accepts them into his life. Later, Emma shares Henry's theory with Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin), that she is Snow White's daughter and Mary Margaret is Snow White. Mary finds this laughable, but seeing Emma's blanket triggers some sort of reaction from her. After a minute, however, she is quick to dismiss it as nothing.|$|E
50|$|He married twice; firstly Anne Mynote, {{with whom}} <b>he</b> had <b>at</b> <b>least</b> {{two sons and}} {{secondly}} Margery, with whom <b>he</b> had <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one son.|$|R
50|$|Jamie McMurray {{clinched}} {{by starting}} the race. Ryan Newman would clinch by finishing 31st or better, 32nd if <b>he</b> led <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one lap or 33rd if {{he led the}} most laps. Jeff Gordon would clinch by finishing 17th or better, 18th if <b>he</b> led <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one lap or 19th if he led the most laps. Paul Menard would clinch by finishing ninth or better, 10th if <b>he</b> led <b>at</b> <b>least</b> one lap or 11th if he led the most laps.|$|R

He was succeeded by {{his eldest son}} Aubrey.|$|R
5|$|Mayor West {{passes a}} law to legalize the drug, and {{everyone}} starts smoking it; the town has improved as a result, with milestones such as an increase in productivity {{and a decrease in}} crime. However, Lois's father, Carter, begins to lose money in the timber industry since hemp is being used to manufacture many products, particularly paper, and he bribes Peter to help him with an anti-marijuana campaign. Lois, however, points out that their methods are uninspired, explaining that Brian only succeeded because he was passionate about legalizing cannabis. Carter decides to bribe Brian to join his cause by publishing and shipping his novel, Faster Than the Speed of Love. Brian resists at first, but Stewie suggests <b>he</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> perform a number about the health risks of cannabis, since the book does not have enough merit to sell on its own. Brian reluctantly complies, and the drug becomes illegal once more.|$|E
25|$|The {{notion of}} the {{criminal}} as 'Everyman', morally {{no different from the}} audience, was then totally abandoned; the reader could comfort himself with the knowledge that <b>he</b> <b>at</b> <b>least,</b> unlike the criminal, was saved.|$|E
25|$|Thục {{moved to}} Toulon, France, {{where he was}} {{assigned}} a confessional in the cathedral until about 1981. <b>He</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> once concelebrated the Mass of Paul VI (the new rite of Mass promulgated by Pope Paul VI in 1969) in the vernacular. One author claims Thục served at the Mass of Paul VI as an acolyte several times.|$|E

25|$|Boyns {{worked out}} some of his {{frustration}} with a hundred for the second team against Gloucestershire II, and {{at the start of}} July he was rewarded with a County Championship debut against Lancashire. Worcestershire won by an innings thanks to a superb all-round display by Imran Khan (111*; 7–53 and 6–46) so Boyns was only allowed a single innings, in which he scored 23. He also bowled seven wicketless overs for a cost of 17 runs. In a losing appearance in the B Cup final two weeks later <b>he</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> claimed his first senior wickets: Kent's Graham Johnson and Alan Ealham.|$|E
25|$|After {{his stay}} in Italy, {{he was in}} southwestern Macedonia as a teacher in Siatista and Kostur (Kastoria). There he also began to teach the rationalism of René Descartes, which the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople saw as unsuitable. Thus, the Orthodox leaders {{temporarily}} removed him from his position until <b>he</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> nominally renounced his heretic teachings. After his stay in South Macedonia, Pavlovich was, for a year, a teacher in Risan on the Adriatic coast of Montenegro. In 1721, Pavlovich travelled around the Ohrid region and the mountains of Albania, visiting holy sites of the Orthodox Church.|$|E
25|$|In 1909 another {{action of}} the {{territorial}} legislature created the Museum of New Mexico. Hewett was a logical choice to be its first director, and was installed in the position. The enabling legislation mandated that the Museum be managed by the SAR, helping to solidify Hewett's grasp on both positions. Hewett staffed the Museum's administrative functions with several {{of his friends and}} supporters from the Normal School days, and persuaded Alice Fletcher to take a key advisory role as well. This of course exposed him to complaints from his critics about cronyism, but ensured that <b>he</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> had a stable power base within the institution. The Museum was empowered by the legislature to acquire land containing some key archaeological sites in the state that were not yet protected by the Antiquities Act, and under Hewett, it did so.|$|E

25|$|Sævil Jarl's son Hrókr (Hróarr and Helgi's nephew) becomes jealous {{that he has}} not {{inherited}} {{anything from}} his grandfather Halfdan; he goes to his uncle Helgi to claim his inheritance. Helgi refuses to give him a third of Denmark, and so instead he goes to Northumbria to claim the golden ring. He asks Hróarr if <b>he</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> could {{have a look at the}} ring, whereupon he takes the ring and throws it into the water. Hróarr naturally becomes angry, and cuts off Hrókr's feet and sends him back to his ships. Hrókr cannot live with this, and so he returns with a large army and slays Hróarr. Helgi avenges his brother by also cutting off Hrókr's arms. Hróarr's son Agnar retrieves the ring by diving in the water, which gives him great glory. Agnar is said to have become greater than his father, and much talked of in the old sagas.|$|E
25|$|The Conservatives {{had so far}} {{failed to}} {{represent}} a serious challenge to Labour's rule, with John Major's successor William Hague unable to make any real improvement upon the disastrous 1997 general election result at the next election four years later. He stepped down after the 2001 election to be succeeded by Iain Duncan Smith, who did not even hold the leadership long enough to contest a general election – being ousted by his own MP's in October 2003 and being replaced by Michael Howard, who had served as Home Secretary {{in the government of}} John Major. Howard failed to win the 2005 general election for the Conservatives but <b>he</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> had the satisfaction of narrowing the Labour majority, giving his successor (he announced his resignation shortly after the election) a decent platform to build upon. However, the Conservatives began to re-emerge as an electable prospect following the election of David Cameron as Howard's successor in December 2005. Within months of Cameron becoming Conservative leader, opinion polls during 2006 were showing a regular Conservative lead {{for the first time since}} Black Wednesday 14 years earlier. Despite the economy still being strong and unemployment remaining low, Labour's decline in support was largely blamed upon poor control of immigration and allowing Britain to become what was seen by many as an easy target for terrorists.|$|E
500|$|An Australian {{commentator}} observes, [...] "Gossip may {{not have}} been the most popular itinerant to venture to these shores in the nineteenth century, but when he announced his challenge... <b>he</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> brought the question of an official Chess Champion of Australia before the chess playing fraternity". In 1950, when Esling was 90, the Australian Chess Federation formally declared, belatedly, that he had become the first Australian Chess Champion by winning his 1885 match against Gossip. The Second Australian Chess Championship, a tournament, was held at Adelaide in 1887. Gossip finished third with 6½ out of 9, behind Henry Charlick (7½points) and Esling (7points).|$|E

500|$|In 1999, American {{rock band}} The Afghan Whigs covered {{the song and}} {{included}} it on two of their extended plays Honky's Ladder and Bonnie & Clyde EP. Journalist Jason Ankeny from AllMusic said the rendition proved that [...] "even if [...] doesn't possess a heart, <b>he</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> has a brain — albeit in his pants." [...] According to Spin, [...] "Creep" [...] was also reported to be sung by the famous Las Vegas entertainer Wayne Newton during the time. In 2014, singers Nick Carter and Jordan Knight covered the song {{as part of a}} 1990s hits medley on their North American tour. On the 2015 season of Idols South Africa, the song was performed by three contestants Mmatema Moremi, Busisiwe Mthembu and Nonhle Mhlongo during the show's [...] "Hell Week" [...] round. The X Factor UKs infamous contestant Honey G had also covered the track during the bootcamp episode aired in 2016.|$|E
500|$|X was {{introduced}} on the series via {{a phone call}} made to Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) in the second season episode [...] "The Host", telling Mulder that he had [...] "a friend in the FBI". However, the character did not appear on-screen until [...] "Sleepless", two episodes later, aiding Mulder in an investigation by leaking information on a secret military project from the Vietnam War. [...] While X's loyalties and his own agenda were often unclear, he proved more than once that <b>he</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> does not want Mulder dead. In the episode [...] "End Game", he is approached by Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who pleads {{that she needs to}} know where Mulder is, believing his life to be in danger. Initially X refuses, and is subsequently confronted by Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), who seemed to recognize X. He relinquishes Mulder's location, though not until after a brief but intense scuffle with Skinner. In the episode [...] "731", X's loyalty to Mulder is further confirmed. Trapped on a train car equipped with a time bomb, Mulder, about to escape, is attacked brutally by the Red Haired Man, a Men in Black assassin. X fatally shoots the Red Haired Man as he is about to step off the car, then boards the car with only enough time left to save either Mulder or the alien-human hybrid the car was transporting. He opts to save Mulder, and carries him off to safety just as the car explodes.|$|E

2500|$|Kahlo {{soon began}} a {{relationship}} with Rivera, despite his being 42 years old, having had two common-law wives, and being a self-confessed womanizer. He was considered attractive by women as <b>he</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> outwardly refrained from the macho act —according to which women were inferior to and [...] "owned" [...] by men— that was {{a central part of}} Mexican masculinity. Kahlo and Rivera were married in a civil ceremony at the town hall of Coyoacán on August 21, 1929. Her mother was against the marriage, and both parents referred to it as a [...] "marriage between an elephant and a dove", referring to the couple's differences in size: Rivera was tall and overweight while Kahlo was petite and fragile. Regardless, her father approved as Rivera was wealthy and therefore able to support Kahlo, who could not work and had to receive expensive medical treatment. The wedding was reported by the Mexican and international press, and the marriage would be subject to constant media attention in Mexico in the coming years, with articles referring to the couple as simply [...] "Diego and Frida".|$|E
2500|$|After sailing {{far enough}} for safety, Every gave the non-conspirators {{a chance to}} go ashore, even deferentially {{offering}} to let Captain Gibson command the ship if he would join their cause. According to Charles Ellms, Every's words to Gibson were, [...] "if you have a mind to make one of us, we will receive you; and if you turn sober, and attend to business, perhaps in time I may make you up of my lieutenants; if not, here's a boat, and you shall be set on shore." [...] The captain declined and was set ashore with several other sailors. The only man who was prevented from voluntarily leaving was the ship's surgeon, whose services were deemed too important to forgo. All of the men left on board the Charles II unanimously elected Every captain of the ship. Some reports say that Every was much ruder in his dealings with Captain Gibson, but agree that <b>he</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> offered him the position of second mate. In either case, Every exhibited an amount of gentility and generosity in his operation of the mutiny that indicates his motives were not mere adventure.|$|E
