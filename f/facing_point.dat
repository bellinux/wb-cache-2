However, Highley's passing loop lacks a platform and <b>Facing</b> <b>Point</b> Locks on points to attached sidings, a legal requirement for passenger-carrying line, meaning trains carrying fare-paying passengers may not use this loop. However, it is frequently used for works trains, demonstration goods trains and empty stock workings. Despite this, the Severn Valley Railway offers, possibly, the most intensive service on any single line heritage railway.|$|E
25|$|A railway {{inspector}} authorised by the Office of Rail Regulation {{inspected the}} section between Dereham and Hoe {{prior to the}} first passenger train using the track, the inspector set out rules governing the frequency of use and the necessary inspection regime that should be used on this section {{as well as the}} maximum speed permitted. The inspector limited the use of the line north of Dereham to 12 days per year for passenger trains {{due to the lack of}} operational signalling equipment in the Dereham station area and the absence of a <b>Facing</b> <b>Point</b> Lock on the points immediately north of Norwich Road level crossing, this legally means they must be clipped and locked manually prior to use by passenger trains. The speed limit north of Dereham is 15mph due to the condition of the track, the speed limit could be increased by adding additional ballast.|$|E

As far as can be ascertained, Nottingham was unique in having a complete system with these types of points.

40|$|Utilizing the {{subdivision}} for bicubic uniform B-spline surfaces, Ed Catmull and Jim Clark, following {{the methodology of}} Doo and Sabin noted that {{the subdivision}} rules expressed for the cubic B-spline surface not only work for arbitrary rectangular meshes, but can also be extended to meshes of an arbitrary topology. This extension was accomplished by generalizing {{the definition of a}} <b>face</b> <b>point,</b> by modifying the method for calculating vertex points (which extends that of the uniform B-spline case), and by specifying a method for reconnecting the points into a mesh. Specifying the Refinement Procedure Given a mesh of control points with an arbitrary topology, we can generalize the <b>face</b> <b>point,</b> edge point, vertex point specification from the uniform B-spline surface calculations to obtain • For each face of the mesh, generate the new <b>face</b> <b>points</b> – which are the average of all the original <b>points</b> defining the <b>face</b> (We note that faces may have 3, 4, 5, or many points now defining them). • Generate the new edge points – which are calculated as the average of the midpoints of the original edge with the two new <b>face</b> <b>points</b> of the <b>faces</b> adjacent to the edge. • Calculate the new vertex points – which are calculated as the average of Q, 2 R and (n− 3) S n, where Q is the average of the new <b>face</b> <b>points</b> of all <b>faces</b> adjacent to the original <b>face</b> <b>point,</b> R is the average of the midpoints of all original edges incident on the original vertex point, and S is the original vertex point. The mesh is reconnected by the following method. • Each new <b>face</b> <b>point</b> is connected to the new edge points of the edges defining the original face. • Each new vertex point is connected to the new edge points of all original edges incident on the original Example vertex point. For an example of this process consider the mesh consisting of four triangles in a diamond pattern, as is illustrated below. First, we construct the <b>face</b> <b>points,</b> which are calculated as the average of the points that make up each of the original <b>faces.</b> These <b>points</b> are shown in the figure below, labeled with an F...|$|R

Acoustics are represented by line spectral frequencies (LSF), and <b>face</b> <b>points</b> are represented with their principal components (PC). During the synthesis stage, speech input is rated {{in terms of its}} similarity to the codebook entries. Based on the similarity, each codebook entry is assigned a weighting coefficient. If the phonetic information about the test speech is available, this is utilized in restricting the codebook search to only several codebook entries which are visually closest to the current phoneme (a visual phoneme similarity matrix is generated for this purpose).
