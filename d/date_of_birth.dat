5|$|One {{chronology}} {{assumes that}} the Aitareya, Taittiriya, Kausitaki, Mundaka, Prasna, and Katha Upanishads has Buddha's influence, and is consequently placed after the 5th century BCE, while another proposal questions this assumption and dates it independent of Buddha's <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>birth.</b> After these Principal Upanishads are typically placed the Kena, Mandukya and Isa Upanishads, but other scholars date these differently. Not much {{is known about the}} authors except for those, like Yajnavalkayva and Uddalaka, mentioned in the texts.
