40|$|Abstract This study proposes an {{analysis}} of non-operational mechanisms that can impact the effectiveness of <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> governance in the Brazilian public administration. A questionnaire was sent to <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> managers and experienced professionals {{in the area of}} <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> governance, who work in public organizations. Based on the collected data, we used the structural equations technique to verify the impact of the following mechanisms on the effectiveness of <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> governance: top management support; performance of the <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> steering committee; use of <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> strategic planning; performance of the <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> investment portfolio management. The study indicates that the first three mechanisms do not influence the perceived effectiveness of <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> governance in the Brazilian public sector. However, the performance of the <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> investment portfolio management has a direct and positive consequence on effectiveness; also, as a mediating variable, it significantly affects the performance of the <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> steering committee, increasing the effectiveness of Brazilian public <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> governance. Through the achieved results and the analysis of these effects, this study aims to contribute theoretically to the literature on <b>information</b> <b>technology</b> governance, as there are few studies that examine which mechanisms assist to establish this effectiveness in public organizations, and even less {{when it comes to the}} Brazilian public sector...|$|R
