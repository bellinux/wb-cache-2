In her review for About.com, Carey Bryson said: [...] "The movie is a great Halloween flick for kids in the target age group (about ages 8-14, depending {{on their ability to}} handle scary content), and stars some of the big names in current kid culture". Melanie Dee of Yahoo! Voices called The Haunting Hour: Don't Think About It [...] "a fast-paced movie".

500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was largely mixed. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "C+" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "disappointing". Despite noting that it is [...] "a totally serviceable episode of Adventure Time", {{he argued that the}} episode felt too much like an episode from the show's first or second seasons, when installments were often lacking in depth and a bit more uneven across the board. He noted that, [...] "Tonight’s episode is for the kids. It’s simple and <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow,</b> and doesn’t contain any unsettling imagery … but that also prevents it from being especially memorable." [...] Ultimately, he felt that the show's returned fixation on Finn and Jake proved that the expansion of the show's universe was [...] "the best thing that could have happened to it." ...|$|E
500|$|Also in {{the park}} is the Coosa Backcountry Trail, a strenuous [...] loop which climbs Coosa Bald and Slaughter Mountain. The trail is marked with green blazes and is {{generally}} <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow.</b> It fords streams on its lower segments before ascending Duncan's Ridge near the summit of Coosa Bald at over [...] elevation, where it joins the Duncan Ridge Trail. The joined trail then makes a descent, then climbs slightly to the summit of Wildcat Knob, then descends to Wolfpen Gap where it crosses State Route 180. Across Wolfpen Gap, the trail makes a steep ascent up Slaughter Mountain, then descends to Slaughter Gap where the Coosa Backcountry and Duncan Ridge Trail split. From this point, the Duncan Ridge Trail leads directly to Blood Mountain where it meets the Appalachian Trail. The Coosa Backcountry Trail makes a steep [...] descent down the mountain and joins with the Bear Hair Gap Trail, leading {{back to the point}} of origin. The Appalachian Trail can also be accessed from nearby Neel's Gap, just a little higher up Blood Mountain on Highway 19/129; hikers can reach this area from the Byron Herbert Reece Trail.|$|E
500|$|Affleck {{subsequently}} starred as an autistic accountant in {{the action}} thriller The Accountant. The film was a commercial success, greatly exceeding box office expectations. Peter Debruge of Variety felt Affleck's [...] "boy-next-door" [...] demeanour– [...] "so normal and non-actorly {{that most of his}} performances feel like watching one of your buddies up on screen"– was [...] "a terrific fit" [...] for the role. Stephen Holden of The New York Times wondered why Affleck, [...] "looking appropriately dead-eyed and miserable," [...] committed himself to the film. Live by Night, which he wrote, directed, co-produced, and starred in, was released in late 2016. Adapted from Dennis Lehane's novel of the same name, the Prohibition-era gangster drama received largely unenthusiastic reviews and failed to recoup its $65 million production budget. David Sims of The Atlantic described it as [...] "a fascinating mess of a movie" [...] and criticized Affleck's [...] "stiff, uncomfortable" [...] performance. But he noted that one of the last action scenes [...] "is so wonderfully staged, its action crisp and <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow,</b> that it reminds you what skill Affleck has with the camera". In October 2016, Affleck and Damon made a one-off stage appearance for a live reading of the Good Will Hunting screenplay at New York's Skirball Theater.|$|E

500|$|Joy Kim of Manga Life also {{praised the}} art style saying the {{characters}} were distinctive. She criticized {{the relationship of}} the lead couple, Si-Joon Lee and Mu-Yeon Park, saying that Mu-Yeon should not be so sweet and protective of someone who does not return her feelings. Kim praised the character Ji-Oh Yun as the most interesting character in the series and that his relationship with Mu-Hwa Park is interesting. Melinda Beasi of Manga Bookshelf reviewed the first volume and concluded that despite being [...] "somewhat muddled, the visual storytelling is not. The art is clean, lovely, and <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow,</b> with a nicely restrained use of elaborate backgrounds and imaginative panel layouts. The character designs are pretty, distinct, and occasionally even creepy, as with Mu-Yeon's eternally smiling mask. The overall look is undeniably [...] "manhwa" [...] – a draw for some and a turn-off for others." [...] Erin Jones of Mania.com noted the distinct and typical romance story in the first volume, but found the first volume enjoyable and noted that the interactions of the [...] "Pig Girl" [...] are what will drive the series despite the volume ending without strong development of the characters. A review of volume two by Pop Culture Shock gave it a [...] "B+" [...] despite confusion caused by the plot and [...] "vagueness on the villain front, Pig Bride is still a very entertaining tale." ...|$|E
500|$|Of all the {{elements}} of the series, Zombiepowder.s action sequences received the most feedback. The battle scenes were criticized for their unsophisticated art by Anime News Network, with rough drawings and few backgrounds, though in its second review ANN noted a guiding philosophy to the background omission: elements of the scene which were not props in the fight faded out whenever action began. ANN also said that the action was entertainingly violent, kinetic, well-paced, <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow,</b> and interspersed well with comedic moments. They ultimately concluded the action was handled better than average, but with the disclaimer that the action was [...] "the entire sum and substance" [...] of the series. IGN opened their review with a Tite Kubo quote from the first volume's flap: [...] "The theme is fighting. Sitting there and just reading it without thinking is fine. But if you ever feel like it please try to use your mind as you read," [...] and said that if this advice was taken Zombiepowder. could be a [...] "great shōnen tale", but that without it the story was only enjoyable by dissection and comparison to other series. Gorban's view was again the most positive, stating that the essential trait of a memorable fight scene is to pit two charismatic figures with contrasting personalities and combat styles against each other, and that the series grasped this notion admirably. Finally, Den of Geek found Zombiepowder.s [...] "wall-to-wall" [...] action sequences colorful and fun, but complained that the sheer mass of them overwhelmed the rest of the story.|$|E
500|$|The manga has {{received}} a mostly positive reception from critics. Jason Thompson commented that Dragon Ball [...] "turns from a gag/adventure manga to a nearly-pure fighting manga". James S. Yadao, author of The Rough Guide to Manga, explains that the first several chapters [...] "play out much like Saiyuki (Journey to the West) with Dr. Slump-like humour built in" [...] and that Dr. Slump, Toriyama's previous manga, has a clear early influence on the series. He feels the series [...] "established its unique identity" [...] after the first time Goku's group disbands and he trains under Kame-sen'nin. On {{the second half of}} the manga, he commented that it developed [...] "a far more action-packed, sinister tone" [...] with [...] "wilder" [...] battles and aerial and spiritual elements with an increased death count. David Brothers for ComicsAlliance wrote that: [...] "Like Osamu Tezuka and Jack Kirby before him, Toriyama created a story with his own two hands that seeped deep into the hearts of his readers, creating a love for both the cast and the medium at the same time." [...] He said that while the author has [...] "a sublime combination of Looney Tunes-style classic humor and dirty jokes," [...] the best part of Dragon Ball is the fight scenes. Brothers explained that while Western superhero comics [...] "would focus on a series of cool poses or impact shots" [...] with the reader having to fill in the blanks between panels, Dragon Ball has a panel dedicated to one action and the next panel features the very next maneuver, making them incredibly <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Its final {{redaction}} probably {{belongs to}} the end of the 4th century, but the individual scholars who brought it to its present form cannot be fixed with assurance.
