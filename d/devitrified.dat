2500|$|Two {{types of}} glass solders are used: vitreous, and <b>devitrifying.</b> Vitreous solders retain their {{amorphous}} structure during remelting, can be reworked repeatedly, and are relatively transparent. <b>Devitrifying</b> solders undergo partial crystallization during solidifying, forming a glass-ceramic, {{a composite of}} glassy and crystalline phases. <b>Devitrifying</b> solders usually create a stronger mechanical bond, but are more temperature-sensitive and the seal {{is more likely to}} be leaky; due to their polycrystalline structure they tend to be translucent or opaque. <b>Devitrifying</b> solders are frequently [...] "thermosetting", as their melting temperature after recrystallization becomes significantly higher; this allows soldering the parts together at lower temperature than the subsequent bake-out without remelting the joint afterwards. <b>Devitrifying</b> solders frequently contain up to 25% zinc oxide.

The column collapse that generated the widespread ignimbrite deposit most likely occurred due to an increase of the Mass Eruption Rate (MER), (see Eruption column).|$|E
50|$|Rhyolitic {{pyroclastic}} flows were erupted {{during the}} caldera collapse. They contain <b>devitrified</b> fiammes and lack lithic fragments. The lack of fragments {{and the overall}} homogeneity indicates that the deposits were placed in short succession.

Applying devit spray and refiring can also be effective. Alternatively, sandblasting, acid bath, or polishing with a pumice stone or rotary brush can be used to remove the unwanted surface.|$|E

50|$|Spherulites {{are most}} common in silica-rich glassy rocks. Sometimes they compose the whole mass; more usually they are {{surrounded}} by a glassy or felsitic base. When obsidians are <b>devitrified,</b> the spherulites are often traceable, {{though they may be}} more or less completely recrystallized or silicified. In the center of a spherulite there may be a crystal (e.g. quartz or feldspar) or sometimes a cavity. Occasionally spherulites have zones of different colors, and while most frequently spherical, they may also be polygonal or irregular in outline. In some New Zealand rhyolites the spherulites send branching cervicorn processes (like stags horns) outwards through the surrounding glass of the rock. The name axiolites is given to long, elliptical or band-like spherulites.|$|E
50|$|The {{different}} types of bentonite are each named after the respective dominant element, such as potassium (K), sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), and aluminium (Al). Experts debate a number of nomenclatorial problems with the classification of bentonite clays. Bentonite usually forms from weathering of volcanic ash, most often {{in the presence of}} water. However, the term bentonite, as well as a similar clay called tonstein, has been used to describe clay beds of uncertain origin. For industrial purposes, two main classes of bentonite exist: sodium and calcium bentonite. In stratigraphy and tephrochronology, completely <b>devitrified</b> (weathered volcanic glass) ash-fall beds are commonly referred to as K-bentonites when the dominant clay species is illite. In addition to montmorillonite and illite another common clay species that is sometimes dominant is kaolinite. Kaolinite-dominated clays are commonly referred to as tonsteins and are typically associated with coal.|$|E
5000|$|Pseudotachylite or Pseudotachylyte (original spelling) is a {{cohesive}} glassy or very fine-grained rock that occurs as veins and often contains inclusions of wall-rock fragments. Pseudotachylite is typically dark in color; and is glassy in appearance. It {{was named after}} its appearance resembling the basaltic glass, tachylyte. Typically, the glass is completely <b>devitrified</b> into very fine-grained material with radial and concentric clusters of crystals. The glass may also contain crystals with quench textures that formed via crystallization from the melt. Chemical composition of pseudotachylyte generally reflects the local bulk chemistry. Pseudotachylyte may form via frictional melting of faults, in large-scale landslides, and by impact processes. Many researchers often define the rock as one formed via the melting (c.f. fault rock). However, the original description/definition by Shand did not include interpretation about its generation, and {{it is suggested that}} there are pseudotachylytes formed via comminution without melting (e.g. Wenk, 1978).|$|E

50|$|It {{should not}} be thought that Brill spent the entire decade ensconced in the Corning laboratory; he made various forays to the Middle East, {{including}} accompanying Wertime’s 1968 survey of the ancient technologies of Iran, alongside other great minds such as the noted ceramicist, Frederick Matson (UCL Institute for Archaeo-Metallurgical Studies 2007). In the years 1963-1964, the Corning Museum of Glass and the University of Missouri, following {{a long history of}} excavation at the necropolis of Beth She'Arim, conducted an examination of a huge slab of glass, some 2000 years old, that had been languishing in an ancient cistern (Brill and Wosinski 1965). Brill cannot recall who first suggested this slab, measuring 3.4m by 1.94m, could be made of glass, but the only way to test it was to drill a core through its 45 cm thickness and analyse it (Brill 1967, Brill and Wosinski 1965). On analysis of the core, Brill found that the glass was <b>devitrified</b> and stained, and not very homogenous, with a presence of wollastonite crystals throughout (1965, 219.2). Investigation of the manufacture technology required to produce the slab, suggested that in order to produce such a slab of glass, it would have been necessary to heat over eleven tons of batch material, and sustain it at around 1050˚C for between five and ten days (Brill 1967)! His initial interpretation was that the glass must have been heated either from above or from the sides using a kind of tank furnace; a hypothesis that was proven accurate when excavation underneath the slab suggested it had been melted in situ, in a tank whose floor was a bed of limestone blocks with a thin parting layer of clay (Brill and Wosinski 1965, Brill 1967). Brill’s interpretation, that the slab and its surroundings suggest ‘some early form of reverberatory furnace’ was the first suggestion of the use of tank furnaces in early glassmaking (1967, 92). The evidence at Beth She’arim encouraged further innovative thought because whilst the slab represented glass production on a grand scale, no associated evidence for glass working was found. Brill had already suspected that historical glassmaking occurred in two phases, the heavy ‘engineering’ stage when the glass is formed from the batch ingredients and the ‘crafting’ stage when the glass is formed into artefacts (Brill, pers. comm., 2009). These stages could occur in combination at one location, or at two differing locales, and the time span of production after the initial glass melt is highly flexible. For Brill, the idea of this ‘dual nature of all glassmaking’ was ‘crystallized’ at Beth She’Arim, where only the raw glass production was represented, and would be reinforced later by the contrasting evidence, where working was favoured over production, found at Jalame, as discussed below (Brill, pers. comm., 2009).|$|E

Thermal conductivities were measured at temperatures as high as 280 {sup 0 }C, confining pressures to 10 MPa, and pore pressures to 1. 5 MPa. Extrapolation of measured saturated conductivities to zero porosity suggests that matrix conductivity of both zeolitized and <b>devitrified</b> tuffs is independent of stratigraphic position, depth, and probably location. This fact allows development of a thermal-conductivity stratigraphy for the upper portion of Hole G 1. Estimates of saturated conductivities of zeolitized nonwelded tuffs and <b>devitrified</b> tuffs below the water table appear most reliable. Estimated conductivities of saturated densely welded <b>devitrified</b> tuffs above the water table are less reliable, due to both internal complexity and limited data presently available.
