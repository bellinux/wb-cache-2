500|$|With 54,288 total entries and a {{combined}} prize pool of $159,796,918, the 2007 WSOP {{was the largest}} series of poker tournaments ever. [...] For many, winning {{a share of the}} prize pool was all that mattered, while others sought the glory associated with winning a bracelet. [...] This dichotomy could not have been illustrated better than a deal negotiated at the Senior Championship event. Tony Korfman wanted the money while Ernest Bennett wanted the glory. [...] Rather than leave their fates to chance, the two of them ensured they got what they wanted. In exchange for splitting the prize money, Korfman agreed to let Bennett win the bracelet. [...] After winning $8.25million in the Main Event, Jerry Yang and his wife retired. [...] "My winning today also means a lot to me, because I know that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> this money {{to do a lot of}} good for other people out there," [...] Yang said before donating over a million dollars to charity. [...] Upon winning his record eleventh bracelet, Phil Hellmuth said, [...] "the bracelets have always been a really huge deal, to me more than the other guys, because I knew that they represented history." ...|$|E
500|$|Barton {{does not}} believe Hollywood offers the same opportunity. In the film, Los Angeles {{is a world of}} false fronts and phony people. This is evident in an early line of the {{screenplay}} (filmed, but not included in the theatrical release); while informing Barton of Capitol Pictures' offer, his agent tells him: [...] "I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism– [...] if <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> that word and Hollywood in the same breath". Later, as Barton tries to explain why he's staying at the Earle, studio head Jack Lipnick finishes his sentence, recognizing that Barton wants a place that is [...] "less Hollywood". The assumption is that Hollywood is fake and the Earle is genuine. Producer Ben Geisler takes Barton to lunch at a restaurant featuring a mural of the [...] "New York Cafe", a sign of Hollywood's effort to replicate the authenticity of the East Coast. Lipnick's initial overwhelming exuberance is also a façade. Although he begins by telling Barton: [...] "The writer is king here at Capitol Pictures", in the penultimate scene he insists: [...] "If your opinion mattered, then I guess I'd resign and let you run the studio. It doesn't, and you won't, and the lunatics are not going to run this particular asylum".|$|E

500|$|Because of his {{aggressive}} style-of-play, Selwood {{has gathered}} {{a reputation as}} a [...] "head–over–the–ball specialist" [...] and for consistently putting himself in positions to break tackles and win free kicks. His ability to [...] "buckle his knees, (get) down and pull his arm up so that the tackler's arm goes up above the neck" [...] has been declared by former Hawthorn captain Shane Crawford as [...] "almost impossible to stop at times" [...] and is reflected in his regular standing among league leaders for total free kicks received. It has also led to opposition players noting specific techniques to tackling Selwood—Carlton’s Kade Simpson admitted it was important to [...] "get in low" [...] because [...] "he’s such a master at lifting the elbows, which tries to slip the tackle up around the neck ... there’s no doubt it’s a skill". Selwood has declared the technique as a [...] "benefit and an advantage I’m getting at the moment on someone else because I see a weakness in what they are doing ... the majority of the time they are doing 95 per cent of the tackle right. It’s just that five per cent where <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> my upper body strength, I can dip at the knees slightly". Former Brisbane Lions captain Michael Voss agrees, stating [...] "all he’s doing is keeping his feet, dropping his legs and he’s got a fantastic tenchique in rolling his shoulder ... Selwood shouldn’t be penalised because he’s stronger than the tackler. If I was playing today and I could develop that technique, I’d be looking at it".|$|E
500|$|Olajuwon has {{referred}} to basketball as a science, and described his signature move in vivid detail: [...] "When the point guard throws me the ball, I jump to get the ball. But this jump is the set-up for the second move, the baseline move. I call it the 'touch landing.' The defender is {{waiting for me to}} come down because I jumped but I’m gone before I land. Defenders say 'Wow, he's quick,' but they don’t know that where I’m going is predetermined. He's basing it on quickness, but the jump is to set him up. Before I come down, I make my move. When you jump, you turn as you land. Boom! The defender can’t react because he's waiting for you to come down to defend you. Now, the first time when you showed that quickness, he has to react to that quickness, so you can fake baseline and go the other way with your jump hook. All {{this is part of the}} Dream Shake. The Dream Shake is you dribble and then you jump; now you don’t have a pivot foot. When I dribble I move it so when I come here, I jump. By jumping, I don’t have a pivot foot now. I dribble so now <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> either foot. I can go this way or this way. So he's frozen, he doesn’t know which way I’m going to go. That is the shake. You put him in the mix and you jump stop and now you have choice of pivot foot. He doesn’t know where you’re gonna turn and when." ...|$|E
2500|$|In woodworking, surforms {{are used}} for rapidly {{removing}} wood from curved surfaces. They remove less wood than a drawknife, so they are easier to control. Even though surforms leave very coarse finishes, the worked areas can be easily smoothed with finer tools, such as files and sanding blocks. Woodworker Sam Maloof described their use in chairmaking: [...] "Once I have roughed out the arm on the bandsaw, I use a Surform® (Stanley® model No. 295). This tool does about the same job as a spokeshave -- it can take {{off a lot of}} wood very quickly -- but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> it without worrying about grain direction." ...|$|E

[...] He called Crawford a [...] "true friend" [...] and said the funeral was [...] "the most difficult task I have ever faced in my twenty-five years as a minister." [...] Briegleb later drew attention when he compared the life of Crawford {{to that of the}} Apostle Matthew. [...] Briegleb noted that [...] Matthew had begun as Levi the Politician and said the conversion of Crawford was almost identical to that of the apostle. [...] Briegleb also criticized the press for its coverage of Crawford’s death, noting, [...] "We ought to let the dead sleep." [...] Responding to criticism about taking gifts from such a notorious person, Briegleb said, [...] "If you know of any more sinners who have $25,000, send ‘em along; <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> it." ...|$|E
2500|$|For Frith's early {{unstructured}} music, as with Henry Kaiser on With Friends Like These, and {{his early}} table-top guitar solo performances, {{he used a}} homemade six- and eight-string double-neck guitar created by a friend, Charles Fletcher. Frith told Down Beat magazine in 1983: [...] "It was {{the one and only}} guitar that he ever built ... he constructed it mainly out of old pieces from other guitars that I had, and for the body I think he used an old door." [...] The possibilities offered by homemade instruments prompted Frith to start creating his own guitars, basically slabs of wood on which he mounted a pickup, a bridge, and strings stretched over metal screws. [...] "The basic design of the instrument is supposed to be as rudimentary and flexible as possible," [...] Frith said, [...] "so <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> an electric drill to bore holes into the body of it to achieve certain sounds ..." ...|$|E

On 26 May 2009, Brunne was elected Bishop of Stockholm, succeeding Caroline Krook. She is the first openly lesbian bishop {{in the world and}} the first bishop of the Church of Sweden to have lived in a registered homosexual partnership. Brunne won the election by 413 votes to 365 and said: [...] "It is very positive that our church is setting an example here and is choosing me as bishop based on my qualifications, when they also know that they can meet resistance elsewhere." [...] On the official website of the Church of Sweden, Brunne wrote: [...] "I know what it is to be called into question. I am in the lucky situation that I have power, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> it for the benefit of those who have no power." ...|$|E
2500|$|On June 4, 1966, Don Demeter and Julio Navarro were traded by the Detroit Tigers to the Boston Red Sox for outfielder Joe Christopher and pitcher Earl Wilson. The Red Sox {{had been}} {{attempting}} anywhere from several weeks to {{several months to}} obtain Demeter, offering a combination of catcher Bob Tillman and an infielder, but the Tigers continually rejected the offers. General manager Billy Herman had known Demeter {{ever since he was}} a coach for the Dodgers several years prior. Demeter was a player Herman wanted to acquire ever since he took the manager post in September 1964. [...] "He (Demeter) is a good hitter with power. I know he will take good advantage of our left field wall." [...] He went on to say, [...] "One of the things I like best about Demeter is that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> him at five positions. He can play anywhere in the outfield, and he can play both first and third base. Don will shake up a few people on this club." [...] Herman cited that his then current plan was to put Demeter in center field, but was also considering playing him at third base, where Joe Foy had been struggling offensively. Herman also said he would start Demeter at first base for a few days should rookie first baseman George Scott need any sort of rest.|$|E
2500|$|Nobody's Daughter was {{released}} on April 26, 2010 worldwide on Mercury Records, and was received by music critics with moderately positive acclaim. Rolling Stone gave the album three out of five stars, but noted [...] " [...] was an absolute monster vocalist in the nineties, the greatest era ever for rock singers... She doesn't have that power in her lungs anymore – barely a trace. But at least she remembers, and that means something in itself." [...] The magazine also referred to the album as [...] "not a true success", but a [...] "noble effort". Love's voice, which had been noticeably raspier (likely due to years of scream-singing, drug abuse, and smoking) was compared {{to the likes of}} Bob Dylan. NME gave the album a 6/10 rating, and Robert Christgau rated it an [...] "A-", saying, [...] "Thing is, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> some new punk rage in my life, and unless you're a fan of Goldman Sachs and BP Petroleum, so can you. What's more, better it come from a 45-year-old woman who knows how to throw her weight around than from the zitty newbies and tattooed road dogs who churn most of it out these days. I know—for her, BP Petroleum is just something else to pretend about. But the emotion fueling her pretense is cathartic nevertheless." [...] In support of the release, Hole toured extensively between 2010 and 2012 throughout North America and Europe, as well as performing in Japan, Russia, and Brazil.|$|E
