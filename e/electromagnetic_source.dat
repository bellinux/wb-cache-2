James, Juliet, Kate, and Miles come to Jack’s aid, and an intense gunfight ensues. DHARMA’s men are besieged, and James urges Jack to go ahead and discharge the bomb. However, the bomb does not go off, and the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>source</b> is activated, causing pandemonium. Phil nearly kills James, but is stabbed dead by a rebar in the process. Amidst the chaos, James spots Juliet falling in the chasm and in danger of getting sucked in. He and Kate grasp her hands and he tells her to not to leave him, but the force becomes too strong, causing pain for all of them.

James sobs hysterically, not registering himself, even when Kate and Jack drag him back up.|$|E
50|$|Because the quasistatic {{region is}} defined within one {{wavelength}} of the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>source,</b> emitters {{are limited to}} a frequency range between about 1 kHz and 1 MHz. Reducing the oscillating frequency increases the wavelength and hence {{the range of the}} quasistatic region, but reduces the induced voltage in the receiving loops which worsens the signal-to-noise ratio.

40|$|Introduction Because {{of their}} {{excellent}} temporal accuracy (of {{the order of}} 1 ms), electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) provide the most relevant data for studying the temporal dynamics of brain activity. However, difficulties arise when trying to localize the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>sources</b> of this activity from EEG/MEG scalp recordings. This mathematical inverse problem is indeed ill-posed and largely underdetermined. An efficient way of constraining the problem and thereby reducing the solution space is to perform a regularization. By taking some anatomical and/or functional a priori knowledge into account, the regularization process may yield a more consistent localization of the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>sources.</b> Anatomical priors have already been used (e. g., [1]) but only few regularization methods (e. g., [2]) have introduced functional information so far. In this study, we propose a new multimodal approach for solving the EEG/MEG inverse problem. This method involves...|$|R
40|$|Physical fields whose sources {{exist within}} {{maritime}} vessels are {{of concern to}} ship-designers and military planners. Among the fields of most significance which have been studied intensively, are those of magnetic, acoustic and pressure sources. New technological developments now require analyses of the underwater electric and magnetic fields of onboard, extremely low-frequency <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>sources.</b> This study investigated methods by which the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>sources</b> of maritime vessels may be characterised during normal operations in typical coastal environments. It focused on situations where both the sources and field measurement points were located in a common seawater volume. At the electromagnetic frequencies of interest such a medium acts as a thin conducting layer with significant levels of wave reflection and refraction at the media boundaries. To enhance propagation models of the electromagnetic fields over short ranges, the initial investigations aimed to characterise key parameters of the conducting media in shallow-water conditions Conductivity values of seawater can be readily established by conventional methods. However, {{in the case of}} the seabed media, direct conductivity measurements are usually highly variable along horizontal and vertical sections due to aeons of land erosion, and the long-term effects of inshore waves and currents. Procedures are described which show how electromagnetic theory and indirect measurement techniques may be used to infer the characteristic values of key seabed parameters in shallow-water areas. This element of the study utilised both analytical and numerical electromagnetic models, and the efficacy of each in this context was examined. Subsequent phases of the study analysed the nature of the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>sources.</b> In some situations the sources were regarded as point dipoles, and in others they were assumed to have a finite length. Techniques were developed to characterise the dipole moment, length and the location of a typical ship-like source, when each is treated as an electric current dipole. This information was used in turn to demonstrate the likely accuracy in ranging operations on extremely low-frequency, <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>sources</b> over short ranges, and in shallow-water conditions...|$|R
