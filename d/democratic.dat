5|$|Decisions by Republican {{incumbent}} Peter Fitzgerald and his <b>Democratic</b> predecessor Carol Moseley Braun to {{not participate}} in the election resulted in wide-open <b>Democratic</b> and Republican primary contests involving fifteen candidates. In the March 2004 primary election, Obama won in an unexpected landslide—which overnight made him a rising star within the national <b>Democratic</b> Party, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir, Dreams from My Father. In July 2004, Obama delivered the keynote address at the 2004 <b>Democratic</b> National Convention, seen by 9.1million viewers. His speech was well received and elevated his status within the <b>Democratic</b> Party.|$|E
5|$|During the 1892 presidential campaign, {{there was}} talk of Russell being the Vice Presidential nominee if Senator John M. Palmer were to receive the <b>Democratic</b> Presidential nomination. In early February 1892, Palmer and Patrick A. Collins, a former <b>Democratic</b> Massachusetts Congressman, agreed to make Palmer the <b>Democratic</b> Presidential {{candidate}} and Russell, Collins' personal and political friend, the Vice Presidential candidate. Palmer ended up rejecting the bid, and argued against it at the 1892 <b>Democratic</b> National Convention. Russell received one vote for President on the first ballot.|$|E

5|$|During the West Virginia <b>Democratic</b> Party Senatorial Convention held at Moorefield in August 1886, White {{proposed}} and advocated the first tariff reform and anti-monopoly resolutions ever passed and {{adopted by a}} West Virginia <b>Democratic</b> Party Convention. Prior to its passage at the convention, White's proposal received strong opposition. Tariff reform and anti-monopoly resolutions similar to White's proposal were adopted by the national <b>Democratic</b> Party {{as part of its}} 1888 platform. White had been among the first <b>Democratic</b> Party members in Hampshire County to openly declare his opposition to the fiscal policies of the administration of United States President Grover Cleveland. Under White's leadership, Hampshire County's <b>Democratic</b> delegation was the first <b>Democratic</b> county organization in West Virginia to hold public meetings in opposition to Cleveland's fiscal policies. As the county executive committee chairman, White was the first Democrat in Hampshire County to deliver a public speech denouncing these policies. By 1897, White had participated as a delegate from Hampshire County to most of the Senatorial and Congressional <b>Democratic</b> Party conventions in West Virginia, and every state Gubernatorial convention with the exception of one.|$|E
5|$|During {{the run-up}} to the 2006 Swedish general election, Reinfeldt was {{subjected}} to a smear campaign. Mats Lindström, a staff member in the Social <b>Democratic</b> Party headquarters, admitted to sending e-mails accusing Reinfeldt of tax fraud, false financial declarations and only attaining his position because of his father's influence. The IP address used in the e-mails was traced to the Social <b>Democratic</b> Party headquarters. Social <b>Democratic</b> Party Secretary Marita Ulvskog apologized and said that such behavior was completely unacceptable. A short time after the e-mail campaign, images that depicted Reinfeldt and the Moderate Party in an unflattering light were spread internally within the Social <b>Democratic</b> Party and subsequently leaked to the media. Social <b>Democratic</b> Party spokeswoman Carina Persson confirmed that the material came from the Social <b>Democratic</b> Youth League, but denied the existence of an official smear campaign and stated that the material was not meant to be released or spread to a wider audience.|$|E

5|$|In 1953, Clements was {{appointed}} <b>Democratic</b> party whip, serving under party leader Lyndon B. Johnson. In addition, he retained his {{chairmanship of the}} Senate <b>Democratic</b> Reelection Committee for the 1954 election cycle. He and <b>Democratic</b> National Committee chair Stephen Mitchell agreed that the two committees should conduct separate fund-raising operations {{in order to maximize}} donations for <b>Democratic</b> candidates. Democrats regained control of the Senate in 1954, and Clements instituted the practice of having his committee provide transition services for freshman senators. That practice continues today.|$|E

The <b>Democratic</b> Central Committee chose Fields as a replacement for Cantrill.|$|E

5|$|Barkley {{was among}} 12 {{nominated}} at the 1944 <b>Democratic</b> National Convention {{to serve as}} Roosevelt's running mate {{in the presidential election}} that year, receiving six votes. Delegates favored dropping vice president Henry Wallace from their ticket in favor of Barkley, but Roosevelt refused to consider him, telling a July 11 meeting of <b>Democratic</b> leaders that he was too old. Instead, he took the recommendation of <b>Democratic</b> National Committee chairman Robert E. Hannegan and choose Harry S. Truman.

5|$|Blackwell {{also served}} on the <b>Democratic</b> National Committee and as {{co-chairman}} of the Mississippi <b>Democratic</b> Party.

Although Blackwell did not attend high school, the National Rural Fellows Program helped her gain admittance to the University of Massachusetts by awarding her a scholarship and providing her credit based on activism and life experience.|$|E
5|$|By enfranchising racial minorities, the Act {{facilitated}} {{a political}} realignment of the <b>Democratic</b> and Republican parties. Between 1890 and 1965, minority disenfranchisement allowed conservative Southern Democrats to dominate Southern politics. After <b>Democratic</b> President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Act into law, newly enfranchised racial minorities began {{to vote for}} liberal <b>Democratic</b> candidates throughout the South, and Southern white conservatives began to switch their party registration from Democrat to Republican en masse. These dual trends caused the two parties to ideologically polarize, with the <b>Democratic</b> Party becoming more liberal and the Republican Party becoming more conservative. The trends also created competition between the two parties, which Republicans capitalized on by implementing the Southern strategy. Over the subsequent decades, the creation of majority-minority districts to remedy racial vote dilution claims also contributed to these developments. By packing liberal-leaning racial minorities into small numbers of majority-minority districts, large numbers of surrounding districts became more solidly white, conservative, and Republican. While this increased the elected representation of racial minorities as intended, it also decreased white <b>Democratic</b> representation and increased the representation of Republicans overall. By the mid-1990s, these trends culminated in a political realignment: the <b>Democratic</b> Party and the Republican Party became more ideologically polarized and defined as liberal and conservative parties, respectively; and both parties came to compete for electoral success in the South, with the Republican Party controlling most of Southern politics.|$|E

Offended by the McGovern campaign's treatment of <b>Democratic</b> finance chairman Robert Schwarz Strauss, he helped Strauss get elected chairman of the <b>Democratic</b> National Committee following McGovern's defeat.
