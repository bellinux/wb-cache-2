When determining the reference values, experts on each of the species groups were enlisted from the various voluntary conservation organisations, IMARES Wageningen UR (Texel and IJmuiden) and Alterra Wageningen UR. In addition, two extra questions were answered on how these reference values can be maintained or achieved, and the potential influence of climate warming...|$|R
