5|$|Several enzymes {{can work}} {{together}} in a specific order, creating metabolic pathways. In a metabolic pathway, one enzyme takes the product of another enzyme as a substrate. After the catalytic reaction, the product is then passed on to another enzyme. Sometimes more than one enzyme can catalyze the same reaction in parallel; this can allow more complex regulation: with, for example, a low constant activity provided by one enzyme but an inducible high activity <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> enzyme.|$|E
5|$|The {{approach}} in these sheep experiments involves irradiating a ram’s testes while placing stem cells <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> ram into the testes of the first, ram A. In the following weeks ram A produces semen the usual way, but {{is using the}} stem cells of ram B and therefore producing semen carrying the genetics of ram B rather than those of his own. Ram A therefore has effectively become a surrogate ram.|$|E

5|$|Although OR-7 was {{the first}} gray wolf to visit California in nearly 100 years, other wolves have since {{migrated}} to Siskiyou County, {{just south of the}} Oregon–California border. In 2015, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) released a photo of the Shasta Pack, consisting of two adults and five pups. The breeding pair came from the same pack as OR-7, making them his siblings. In 2017, the CDFW and the U.S. Forest Service determined that at least three wolf pups <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> pack, the Lassen Pack, can be traced to OR-7. One of OR-7s male offspring mated with another wolf to produce the pups, the birth of which made Journey a grandfather. The Lassen Pack, which lives in Lassen National Forest, is California's second pack since wolves were eradicated from the state in the 1920s. In June 2017, CDFW biologists fitted the female of the Lassen Pack breeding pair with a tracking collar.|$|E
5|$|Millar ordered William Strahan {{to print}} {{the work on}} two of his {{printing}} presses to produce a total of 5,000copies for the first run of the work (in comparison, only 3,500copies of The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling were printed {{for the first and}} second edition). This amount proved to be enough for Millar to sell, although he had to back down <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> printing of 3,000copies immediately after the first edition to ensure that the originals were completely sold. The work had two German translations published in 1752, a Dutch translation in 1756, and a French edition in 1762.|$|E
5|$|The company {{turned to}} regular charter {{services}} to Bergen and Stavanger in the 1980s, and from 1984 served the routes with scheduled flights, using seven-passenger Beechcraft 200 King Air. In 1985 {{the company was}} converted to a limited company and bought by Kosmos. It subsequently acquired four 30-passenger Embraer EMB 120 Brasilias—as the second European airline. It introduced several new routes, including international flights to Denmark and the United Kingdom, and took the name Norsk Air. The company bought Norving's Skien Airport, Geiteryggen division in 1987 and started operations <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> base. Kosmos failed in 1988 and Norsk Air was eventually given for free to Widerøe in 1990. Skien operations were discontinued the following year and the airline changed name to Widerøe Norsk Air. It remained a subsidiary until being amalgamated in 1996.|$|E

5|$|Wine was {{commonly}} {{drunk and}} was also regarded as the most prestigious and healthy choice. According to Galen's dietetics it was considered hot and dry but these qualities were moderated when wine was watered down. Unlike water or beer, which were considered cold and moist, consumption of wine in moderation (especially red wine) was, among other things, believed to aid digestion, generate good blood and brighten the mood. The quality of wine differed considerably according to vintage, the type of grape and more importantly, the number of grape pressings. The first pressing was made into the finest and most expensive wines which were reserved for the upper classes. The second and third pressings were subsequently of lower quality and alcohol content. Common folk usually {{had to settle for}} a cheap white or rosé <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> or even third pressing, meaning that it could be consumed in quite generous amounts without leading to heavy intoxication. For the poorest (or the most pious), watered-down vinegar (similar to Ancient Roman posca) would often be the only available choice.|$|E
5|$|Because xenon is a tracer for two parent isotopes, xenon isotope ratios in meteorites are a {{powerful}} tool for studying the formation of the Solar System. The iodine–xenon method of dating gives the time elapsed between nucleosynthesis and the condensation of a solid object from the solar nebula. In 1960, physicist John H. Reynolds discovered that certain meteorites contained an isotopic anomaly {{in the form of an}} overabundance of xenon-129. He inferred that this was a decay product of radioactive iodine-129. This isotope is produced slowly by cosmic ray spallation and nuclear fission, but is produced in quantity only in supernova explosions. Because the half-life of 129I is comparatively short on a cosmological time scale (16 million years), this demonstrated that only a short time had passed between the supernova and the time the meteorites had solidified and trapped the 129I. These two events (supernova and solidification of gas cloud) were inferred to have happened during the early history of the Solar System, because the 129I isotope was likely generated shortly before the Solar System was formed, seeding the solar gas cloud with isotopes <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> source. This supernova source may also have caused collapse of the solar gas cloud.|$|E

25|$|Finally, {{the heat}} for fusion {{ignition}} {{comes not from}} the primary but <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> fission bomb called the spark plug, embedded {{in the heart of}} the secondary.
