30|$|Environmental {{contaminants}} are monitored in aquatic organisms, {{particularly in}} fish, for compliance checking with regulatory directives. In Europe, next to EQSbiota, there are threshold levels for <b>fish,</b> <b>fishery</b> <b>products</b> and seafood according to European food laws {{such as the}} European Contaminant Regulation [34] and the recommendation 2006 / 88 /EC of the European Commission [35]. Furthermore, national directives such as the German regulation on tolerable levels of contaminants in food [36] also define maximum allowable concentrations in food.|$|E
30|$|Monitoring {{chemicals}} in aquatic biota for food surveillance purposes differs from environmental monitoring: In food surveillance, {{the subject of}} protection is solely the human being as consumer. Usually <b>fish,</b> <b>fishery</b> <b>products</b> or seafood are obtained from commercial markets so that the allocation to the ecosystem often remains unclear. In general, chemicals are measured in muscle tissue and refer to fresh weight of the sample. For polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, polychlorinated dibenzofurans and dioxin-like PCBs, values are indicated in toxic equivalents according to the World Health Organisation (WHO-TEQ). Depending on the consumption pattern, analysing muscle tissue with skin may even be appropriate. In the European water framework directive, however, the subjects of protection are either humans or predators [37]. The latter mainly feed on the whole body of smaller fish. If comparing data from food surveillance and environmental monitoring, such aspects need to be considered.|$|E

This hazard is limited to bacterial pathogens since human viral pathogens (viruses) are not able to grow in food.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Along {{the last}} ten years <b>fish</b> and <b>fishery</b> <b>product</b> trade in Brazil has been on a {{downward}} trajectory turning a profit of US$ 98. 6 million in 2005 into a loss of US$ 1. 25 billion by 2014. On the other hand, the country is a leading producer of grains and has the third largest animal feed industry in the world, which has added 5. 5 million hectares of freshwater reservoirs and 3. 5 million km 2 of an exclusive marine economic zone in the same period, a sizable potential for development of the aquaculture industry. This study aims at unveiling strategies for the reduction of the deficit in the Brazilian seafood trade balance, based on critical analysis of the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of imported <b>fishery</b> <b>products.</b> The <b>fish</b> and <b>fishery</b> <b>product</b> trade in Brazil, from 2005 to 2015, was studied considering import and export data mined from the Brazilian Ministry of Development, Industry and Commerce databases through the Aliceweb system, and clustered as follows: processing; product species; origin; conservation; and group. The main imported products were gutted fresh fish, highest price (salmon); salted dried fish, higher price (cod); frozen fish fillets, lowest price (fish and hake). The replacement of fish imports by domestic production is not enough to enable consumers to identify the equivalence between products (technical, qualitative or organoleptic). Developing strategies for the production of <b>fish</b> and <b>fishery</b> <b>products</b> at competitive prices and quantities that meet consumer demand is an immediate need, and the development of the aquaculture industry a rational strategy...|$|R
