5|$|After Harrison's {{preliminary}} studies, {{it became}} clear that the proposed site could not contain a college and an institute for social science research as planned; Nuffield agreed to provide an additional plot of land on the opposite side of Worcester Street. Harrison proposed to build the college on the main site, with the institute on the second site. The hall was to be at the east end of the main site, aligned <b>east</b> <b>to</b> <b>west,</b> with a tower at the west end; the upper quadrangle, to the immediate west of the hall and aligned north to south, would have the Warden's Lodging at the north end and the chapel at the south end; steps would lead down from the upper quadrangle into the lower quadrangle, again aligned <b>east</b> <b>to</b> <b>west,</b> with the main entrance at the far east end of the lower quadrangle. The proposed institute would face the main college entrance across Worcester Street. The sub-committee recommended that Harrison's plans be adopted in January 1939, and a model of the design was shown to Nuffield in June 1939 – he had been abroad for much of the intervening period.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of erosion of {{sandstone}} and the erosion-resistant sills and dikes, the topography in Minnesota has repeated parallel hills and valleys. The tightly packed lakes in the narrow valleys are long and narrow, and they orient from the <b>east</b> <b>to</b> <b>west.</b> The cliffs in these narrow valleys are the habitat to several rare plants which prefer living in narrow cliff areas in a sub-Arctic climate. In Ontario the Rove Formation is overlain by a thick diabase cap.|$|E

5|$|Near {{the end of}} {{the twelfth}} century, the Spanish Muslim {{astronomer}} al-Bitrūjī (Alpetragius) sought to explain the complex motions of the planets without Ptolemy's epicycles and eccentrics, using an Aristotelian framework of purely concentric spheres that moved with differing speeds from <b>east</b> <b>to</b> <b>west.</b> This model was much less accurate as a predictive astronomical model, but it was discussed by later European astronomers and philosophers.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{owing to}} the greater {{presence}} of cold-blooded (ectothermic) reptiles in warmer climates, {{the states in the}} southern half of the United States have more commonly designated a state reptile.
