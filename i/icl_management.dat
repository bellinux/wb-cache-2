The company only leased the house and the immediate grounds for parking. The bulk of the site was out of bounds. The house is now used for corporate events.|$|E
40|$|BackgroundThere is a {{great deal}} of {{heterogeneity}} in the surgical strategy to treat intracardiac leiomyomatosis (ICL), leading to a need to create a theoretical tool to clarify this situation. MethodsThe data of 14 cases of ICL surgically treated in Anzhen Hospital from February 1995 to February 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. A system for classifying ICL was proposed based on four features of the lesion: size of intracardiac component; extent of inferior vena cava (IVC) involvement; venous pathway from uterus to IVC; and laterality of the lesion in the pelvis. The 14 cases of ICL were treated through multiple surgical strategies. ResultsThere were no operative deaths. The follow-up was 73. 1 ± 59. 2 months and one patient died from recurrence due to incomplete excision 5 months after the primary procedure. The 5 -year survival rate calculated through Kaplan-Meier survival curve was 93. 16 ± 4. 98 %. Of the surviving patients, 13 had ICL, 10 were in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I, and three were in NYHA class II. ConclusionThe surgical treatment of ICL can obtain a good mid- to long-term survival rate and satisfactory heart function, and the proposed classification system for ICL may be helpful to guide the selection of the surgical strategy for ICL, and may serve as the future basis for standardising the reporting of <b>ICL</b> <b>management...</b>|$|E
40|$|Integrated crop-livestock systems (ICLs) are {{a viable}} {{strategy}} for the recovery and maintenance of soil characteristics. In the present study, an ICL experiment was conducted by the Instituto Agron&# 244;mico do Paran&# 225; in the municipality of Xambre, Parana (PR), Brazil, to evaluate the effects of various grazing intensities. The objective {{of the present study}} was to quantify the levels of microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and soil enzymatic activity in an ICL of soybean (summer) and Brachiaria ruziziensis (winter), with B. ruziziensis subjected to various grazing intensities. Treatments consisted of varying pasture heights and grazing intensities (GI) : 10, 20, 30, and 40 cm (GI- 10, GI- 20, GI- 30, and GI- 40, respectively) and a no grazing (NG) control. The microbial characteristics analysed were MBC, microbial respiration (MR), metabolic quotient (qCO 2), the activities of acid phosphatase, &# 946;-glucosidase, arylsuphatase, and cellulase, and fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis. Following the second grazing cycle, the GI- 20 treatment (20 -cm - moderate) grazing intensity) contained the highest MBC concentrations and lowest qCO 2 concentrations. Following the second soybean cycle, the treatment with the highest grazing intensity (GI- 10) contained the lowest MBC concentration. Soil MBC concentrations in the pasture were favoured by the introduction of animals to the system. High grazing intensity (10 -cm pasture height) during the pasture cycle may cause a decrease in soil MBC and have a negative effect on the microbial biomass during the succeeding crop. Of all the enzymes analyzed, only arylsuphatase and cellulase activities were altered by <b>ICL</b> <b>management,</b> with differences between the moderate grazing intensity (GI- 20) and no grazing (NG) treatments...|$|E
