He was educated at the Technical University of Munich from 1925 to 1927 and then entered the Technical University of Berlin, where he posited that microscopes using electrons, with {{wavelengths}} 1000 times shorter than those of light, could provide a more detailed picture of an object than a microscope utilizing light, in which magnification {{is limited by the}} size of the wavelengths. In 1931, he demonstrated that a magnetic coil could act as an <b>electron</b> <b>lens,</b> and used several coils in a series to build the first electron microscope in 1933.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{widely used}} {{simulation}} techniques {{that exist in}} literature: the Bloch wave method, derived from Hans Bethe's original theoretical treatment of the Davisson-Germer experiment, and the multislice method. In this paper, we will primarily focus on the multislice method for simulation of diffraction patterns, including multiple elastic scattering effects. Most of the packages that exist implement the multislice algorithm along with Fourier analysis to incorporate <b>electron</b> <b>lens</b> aberration effects to determine electron microscope image and address aspects such as phase contrast and diffraction contrast. For electron microscope samples {{in the form of}} a thin crystalline slab in the transmission geometry, the aim of these software packages is to provide a map of the crystal potential, however this inversion process is greatly complicated by the presence of multiple elastic scattering.|$|E

The majority of <b>electron</b> <b>lenses</b> for TEM use electromagnetic coils to generate a convex lens. The field produced for the lens must be radially symmetrical, as deviation from the radial symmetry of the magnetic lens causes aberrations such as astigmatism, and worsens spherical and chromatic aberration. <b>Electron</b> <b>lenses</b> are manufactured from iron, iron-cobalt or nickel cobalt alloys, such as permalloy.

40|$|We present {{considerations}} {{about the}} transverse beam transfer function (BTF) of beams {{under the influence}} of two effects: The strong-strong beam-beam effect and the influence of a Gaussian <b>electron</b> <b>lens.</b> The BTF are investigated using two methods: BTF excitation is simulated in a particle-in-cell (PIC) code. The BTF model is verified using a known analytic expectation. Analytic expectations for BTF of beams under a stationary <b>electron</b> <b>lens</b> are derived by extending BTF from the formalism of Berg and Ruggiero. Finally we compare the analytic BTF results for a stationary Gaussian lens to both the PIC simulation for split tune conditions and to PIC simulations for a beam influenced by an <b>electron</b> <b>lens.</b> We conclude that the formalism represents the <b>electron</b> <b>lens</b> well and can be applied to a limited extend to the beam-beam effect under split tune conditions. The analytic formalism allows us to recover the strength of an <b>electron</b> <b>lens</b> by means of fitting and can give clues regarding the strength of the beam-beam effect under split tune conditions.

40|$|Progress on the Intensity Frontier of {{high energy}} physics {{critically}} depends on record high intensity charged particles accelerators. Beams in such machines become operationally limited by coherent beam instabilities, particularly enhanced in {{the regime of}} strong space charge (SC). Usual methods to control the instabilities, such as octupole magnets, beam feedback dampers and employment of chromatic effects, become less effective and insufficient. In [1] it was proposed to employ <b>electron</b> <b>lenses</b> for introduction of sufficient spread in particle oscillation frequencies needed for beam stabilization and in [2] it was shown that <b>electron</b> <b>lenses</b> are uniquely effective for Landau damping of transverse beam instabilities in high energy particle accelerators and their employment does not compromise incoherent (single particle) stability, dynamic aperture and the beam lifetime.

40|$|Collimation with hollow {{electron}} beams or lenses (HEL) {{is currently}} {{one of the}} most promising concepts for active halo control in HL-LHC. In previous studies it has been shown that the halo can be efficiently removed with a hollow <b>electron</b> <b>lens.</b> Equally important as an efficient removal of the halo, is to demonstrate that the core stays unperturbed. In the case of an ideal hollow <b>electron</b> <b>lens</b> without bends, the field at the location of the beam core vanishes and the core remains unperturbed. In reality, the field at the beam core does not vanish entirely due to imperfections in the electron beam profile and the <b>electron</b> <b>lens</b> bends necessary to guide the electron in and out of the proton aperture. In particular, in the case of a pulsed operation of the <b>electron</b> <b>lens</b> the non-vanishing residual field induces noise on the proton beam. To identify the most sensitive pulsing patterns for the resonant mode and derive tolerances on the profile imperfections, a first MD was carried out of which the first results are presented in this note...|$|E

40|$|Fermilab's Tevatron is {{currently}} the world's highest energy accelerator in which tightly focused beams of 980 GeV protons and antiprotons collide at two dedicated interaction points (IPs). Both beams share the same beam pipe and magnet aperture and, {{in order to avoid}} multiple detrimental head-on collisions, the beams are placed on separated orbits everywhere except the main IPs by using high-voltage (HV) electrostatic separators. The electromagnetic beam-beam interaction at the main IPs together with the long-range interactions between separated beams adversely affect the collider performance, reducing the luminosity integral per store (period of continuous collisions) by 10 - 30 %. Tuning the collider operation for optimal performance becomes more and more cumbersome as the beam intensities and luminosity increase. The long-range effects which (besides being nonlinear) vary from bunch to bunch are particularly hard to mitigate. A comprehensive review of the beam-beam effects in the Tevatron Collider Run II can be found in Ref. [1]. The beam-beam effects have been the dominating sources of beam loss and lifetime limitations in the Tevatron proton-antiproton collider [1]. <b>Electron</b> <b>lenses</b> were originally proposed for compensation of electromagnetic long-range and head-on beam-beam interactions of proton and antiproton beams [2].

This difference was attributed to frequency dependence in the BPM system. The TEL- 2 BPMs utilize a new compact four plate design with grounding strips between plates to minimize crosstalk. In-situ measurements of these new BPMs are made using a stretched wire pulsed with both proton and electron beam formats. In addition, longitudinal impedance measurements of the TEL- 2 are presented.

40|$|During Phase I, the {{following}} goals were achieved: (1) design and fabrication of a novel, nano-dimensional CNT field emitter assembly for high current density application, with high durability; (2) fabrication of a ceramic based micro channel plate (MCP) and characterization of its secondary electron emission; and (3) characterizing the CNT/MCP cathode for high field emission and durability. As {{a result of}} these achievements, a relatively high current density of ~ 1. 2 A/cm 2 from a CNT cathode and single channel MCP were measured. The emission current was also extremely stable with a peak-to-peak variation of only 1. 8 %. The emission current could be further enhanced to meet requirements for <b>electron</b> <b>lens</b> applications by increasing the number of MCP channels. A calculation for maximum possible current density with a 1200 channel/cm 2 MCP, placed over a cathode with 1200 uniformly functioning CNTs, would be ~ 1. 46 kA/cm 2, neglecting space charge limitations. Clearly this level of emission is far greater than what is needed for the <b>electron</b> <b>lens</b> application, but it does offer a highly comforting margin to account for sub-standard emitters and/or to allow the lesser challenge of building a cathode with fewer channels/cm 2. A satisfactory goal for the <b>electron</b> <b>lens</b> application would be a controllable emission of 2 - 4 mA per channel in an ensemble of 800 - 1200 uniformly-functioning channels/cm 2, and a cathode with overall area of about 1 cm 2...|$|E

In the wartime and early post-war years, the first proposals for correcting Cs were made and in 1947, in a second milestone paper, Scherzer listed these and other ways of correcting lenses; soon after, Dennis Gabor invented holography for the same purpose. These approaches will be briefly summarized and the work that led to the successful implementation of quadupole–octopole and sextupole correctors in the 1990 s will be analysed.
