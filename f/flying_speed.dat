25|$|Although {{the crash}} was {{originally}} blamed on pilot error, it was subsequently {{found to have}} been caused by slush {{towards the end of the}} runway, causing deceleration of the aircraft and preventing safe <b>flying</b> <b>speed.</b> During take-off, the aircraft had reached , but, on entering the slush, dropped to , too slow to leave the ground, with not enough runway to abort the take-off. Aircraft with tail-wheel undercarriages had not been greatly affected by slush, due to the geometry of these undercarriages in relation to the aircraft's centre of gravity, but newer types, such as the Ambassador, with nose wheel landing-gear and the main wheels behind the centre of gravity, were found to be vulnerable. The accident resulted in the imposition of operating limits for the amount of slush build-up permitted on runways.|$|E

50|$|<b>Speed</b> <b>flying</b> (also {{known as}} speed riding) is the air sport of flying a small, fast fabric wing, usually in close {{proximity}} to a steep slope. <b>Speed</b> <b>flying</b> and <b>speed</b> riding are very similar sports; <b>speed</b> <b>flying</b> is when the speed wing is foot-launched, while speed riding (or ski gliding) is a winter sport done on skis. Sustained flight with a speed glider is possible over a ridge in strong winds.|$|R
50|$|Because {{the density}} of water is so much higher than air, the same wing {{excursion}} in either medium will produce more thrust in water. As a result, relative wing size in swimming birds tend to be smaller than comparably sized birds that fly only. Marine birds also tend to have higher than expected body mass as a mechanism to counteract buoyancy forces when submerged. The combination of smaller wings and increased body mass-produce higher wing loading in these birds, resulting in faster <b>flying</b> <b>speeds.</b> While high <b>flying</b> <b>speeds</b> can be detrimental to landing on tree perches for flying birds, there is little consequence to high impact landing in water.|$|R
500|$|The {{common loon}} {{is an expert}} fisher, {{catching}} its prey underwater by diving as deep as [...] With its large webbed feet, the common loon is an efficient underwater pursuit predator and adroit diver. It needs a long run-up distance to gain momentum for flight take-off, and is ungainly on land, sliding on its belly and pushing itself forward with its legs. Its clumsiness on land {{is due to the}} legs being positioned at the rear of its body; their pelvic muscles are well developed, ideal for swimming but not well-suited for walking. When it lands on water, it skims along on its belly to slow down, rather than braking with its feet, as they are set too far back. The common loon swims and dives well, and flies competently for hundreds of kilometres in migration. It flies with its neck outstretched, usually calling a particular tremolo {{that can be used to}} identify a flying loon. Its <b>flying</b> <b>speed</b> is as much as [...] during migration.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the case}} of transcontinental {{migration}} where distances are large, the <b>flying</b> <b>speed</b> of the butterfly ( [...] {{of the order of}} 3 metres per second or less) is inadequate for timely completion of journey. The migration is carried out by relying on heavy winds; a persistent wind speed of 10 metres per second being able to provide a displacement of 300 to 400 kilometers in a single day. For example, the painted lady (Vanessa cardui) migrates from Africa to Spain aided by tail winds.|$|E
50|$|As {{demonstrated}} by birds, flapping wings offer potential advantages in maneuverability and energy savings compared with fixed-wing aircraft, {{as well as}} potentially vertical take-off and landing.

50|$|<b>Speed</b> <b>flying</b> and <b>Speed</b> riding {{requires}} different wing sizes {{because of}} the different glide angles, and launch techniques. <b>Speed</b> <b>flying</b> requires a larger, slower wing for foot launches (between 13 and 18 square metres), while Speed riding involves a faster, smaller, ski-launched wing (between 8 and 14 square metres). This allows the pilot to periodically touch down and speed ride the slope on skis or a snowboard.|$|R
2500|$|The Skymaster handles {{differently}} from a conventional twin-engine aircraft, primarily in {{that if an}} engine fails, the plane will not yaw toward that engine. Without the issue of differential thrust inherent to conventional (engine-on-wing) twins, engine failure on takeoff will not produce yaw from the runway heading. [...] With no one-engine-out minimum controllable speed (Vmc), in-flight control at any <b>flying</b> <b>speed</b> with an engine inoperative is not as critical {{as it is with}} engines on the wing with the associated leverage; however, performance in speed and, particularly, rate of climb are affected. Flying a Skymaster requires a pilot to hold a multiengine rating, although many countries issue a special [...] "centerline thrust rating" [...] for the Skymaster and other similarly configured aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|The {{probable}} {{cause of the}} accident was that [...] "The aircraft was allowed to lose height and <b>flying</b> <b>speed</b> {{with the result that}} the pilot was no longer able to exercise asymmetric control." [...] While the reasons for the loss of power and the subsequent loss of height and speed were not known, the Public inquiry investigating the accident found a number of serious flaws in the running of Independent Air Travel and the maintenance of the aircraft. Maintenance had been carried out on one of the aircraft propellers at Heathrow on the night before the accident by personnel who were not qualified to carry out the work. [...] The aircraft was overloaded, and the pilot had not had adequate rest, having effectively been on duty for 31 hours 30minutes compared with the 16 hours required by the regulations (This took advantage of a loophole in regulations that allowed crew to carry out flights during [...] "rest" [...] hours if no passengers or cargo was carried.). Check flights, which should have tested the pilot's ability to handle the aircraft at high weights and with one engine out were [...] "perfunctory" [...] and did not adequately prove the pilot's ability to handle the aircraft with one engine failed.|$|E
50|$|The {{trade-off}} {{is that a}} {{model with}} low <b>flying</b> <b>speed</b> is more susceptible to wind and turbulence.

Origami types will have 'ludicrous' or very high cambers in comparison with more marginally performing scale types, whose escalating masses demand higher <b>flying</b> <b>speeds</b> and so lower induced drag from high camber, though this will vary depending on type being modelled.|$|R

50|$|Wing {{morphing}} is {{a modern-day}} extension of wing warping {{in which the}} aerodynamic shape of the wing is modified under computer control. The technique, it is hoped, will give improved control at <b>flying</b> <b>speeds</b> near the speed of sound, where traditional control surfaces are less effective. Wing warping and wing morphing are also currently used to get extra control over an aircraft during difficult times such as in a storm. Research into this field is mainly conducted by NASA.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Speed</b> <b>flying</b> is {{a hybrid}} sport that has {{combined}} elements of paragliding, parachuting, and even skiing {{to create a}} new sport. Like paragliding, <b>speed</b> <b>flying</b> is done by launching from a slope with the wing overhead, already inflated by the incoming air. The main difference between <b>speed</b> <b>flying</b> and paragliding, is that <b>speed</b> <b>flying</b> is meant to create a fast, thrilling ride close to the slope, while the point of paragliding is usually to maintain a longer, gentler flight. The fast landing technique for speed wings is similar to that used in parachuting. However, parachuting or skydiving is done from a plane or fixed object (BASE jumping), and the wing is designed to arrest the free fall. Newer designs of hybrid-wings (also called mini-wings) are now being produced to allow a high speed [...] "hike and fly" [...] from mountainous areas. They can be soared in strong laminar winds and thermalled similar to paragliders, and may also be trimmed for a more traditional <b>speed</b> <b>flying</b> descent.|$|R

5000|$|Except when nesting, swifts {{spend their}} lives in the air, living on the insects caught in flight; they drink, feed, and often mate and sleep on the wing.
