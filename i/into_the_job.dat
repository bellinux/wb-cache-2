5|$|After {{graduating from}} Abha {{teachers}} college in 1999, Wail al-Shehri {{took a job}} as an elementary school physical education teacher at the Khamis Mushait airbase. Five months <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>job,</b> Shehri took leave due to mental illness and depression. Rather than conventional therapy, Wail sought consultation with Muslim clerics, and hoped that a visit to Medina would help. His treatment involved verses from the Qur'an read to him by a sheikh. He traveled to Medina together with Waleed. After the September 11 attacks, others recalled seeing the Shehri brothers in Medina.|$|E

In 2004, John Flynn stood down as chairman, and so for a year long period, Hodgson took up the title of club chairman as well. At the end of the 2004–05 season, he retired from the club. His replacement, Sandra Gordon, is still Chair at the club. She is the first ever female Chair of the club, and only the third {{in the history of the}} Northern League. In 2007, Bernard Fairbairn, who had followed his father and grandfather <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>job,</b> stood down as club secretary, a post he had held since 1961, giving him a total of 46 years in his position. Stephen Moralee has now taken over as club secretary.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} both {{a theoretical}} and an empirical investigation <b>into</b> <b>the</b> impact of <b>job</b> skill types on the black/white pay differentials. The theoretical analysis derives {{that the more}} intensively soft/hard skills are used in an occupation, the greater/smaller the black/white pay differential is there in that occupation. Moreover, {{in response to the}} differential pay gaps across jobs requiring different levels of soft/hard skills, blacks are more likely to self-select themselves <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>jobs</b> that use hard skills more intensively, ceteris paribus. Using NLSY data, we find consistent empirical evidence to our theoretical predictions. Hence, the paper bridges the existing literature on racial pay gaps and cognitive vs. non-cognitive skills by explicitly testing <b>the</b> impact of <b>job</b> skill types on racial pay gaps...|$|R
5|$|After Isaacs left, {{there was}} a period of {{managerial}} instability, with three chief executives in three years. Isaacs's successor, Genista McIntosh, resigned in May 1997 after five months, citing ill-health. Her post was filled by Mary Allen, who moved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> from the Arts Council. Allen's selection did not comply with the Council's rules for such appointments, and following a critical House of Commons Select Committee report on the management of the opera house she resigned in March 1998, as did the entire board of the opera house, including the chairman, Lord Chadlington. A new board appointed Michael Kaiser as general director in September 1998. He oversaw the restoration of the two companies' finances and the re-opening of the opera house. He was widely regarded as a success, and there was some surprise when he left in June 2000 after less than two years to run the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.|$|E

He was tempted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> by Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman who told Seed that Arsenal {{had plans to}} buy Orient {{and turn them into}} a nursery club for Arsenal. Seed commenced the job at £12 a week but within a short time Arsenal were forced to abandon their plans after being told by the Football League that they were unlawful. Without the financial backing of Arsenal, Orient had very little money and the team struggled. In Seed's first season as manager the team finished 16th and then in the following 1932–33 campaign they avoided having to seek re-election on goal average. In August 1933 he accepted the offer of the manager's job at Charlton Athletic despite Sheffield Wednesday trying to tempt Seed back to Hillsborough as a replacement for the manager Bob Brown.|$|E

In 1909, the station master at Redland was withdrawn, his duties incorporated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> of Clifton Down station master. In 1910, Clifton Down saw 17 Great Western services from Avonmouth to Temple Meads and 15 the other way, a further 20 trains each day operating between Clifton and Temple Meads, and 13 Midland trains each way between Clifton and Fishponds or Mangotsfield. Midland services were suspended from 1 January 1917 to 15 May 1919 due to the First World War. The [...] section of the Bristol Port Railway and Pier closed in 1922, so to compensate, an additional six trains were provided from Clifton Down to Avonmouth, and four back.|$|E

500|$|He was {{president}} {{at a time}} that called for almost superhuman skills, yet he lacked such skills and never grew <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> to which he had been elected. His view of the Constitution and the Union was from the Jacksonian past. He never fully understood the nature or depth of Free Soil sentiment in the North. He was able to negotiate a reciprocal trade treaty with Canada, to begin the opening of Japan to western trade, to add land to the Southwest, and to sign legislation for the creation of an overseas empire [...] His Cuba and Kansas policies led only to deeper sectional strife. His support for the Kansas–Nebraska Act and his determination to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act helped polarize the sections. Pierce was hard-working and his administration largely untainted by graft, yet the legacy from those four turbulent years contributed to the tragedy of secession and civil war.|$|E
500|$|Bauer {{said that}} {{nobody in the}} {{administration}} itself directly discussed the offer with Sestak, {{and he does not}} believe there was anything improper, illegal or unethical about the conduct. Republicans in Congress disagreed, arguing the action contradicted claims Obama made during his presidential campaign about ethical conduct and transparency in government. Darrell Issa, in particular, felt it was an impeachable offense and referred to it as [...] "Obama's Watergate". Nevertheless, the matter gradually became less of a focus during the primary election, where other topics like spending and the economy took the spotlight. With Issa poised to become chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform following the Republican Party recapturing the house during the 2010 midterm elections, it was widely expected he would launch an official investigation <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> offer based on his prior critical comments about the matter. However, on November 5, Issa announced he would not pursue an investigation. Some politicians and members of the media said that the job offer made to Sestak was neither illegal nor abhorrent, and that such deals are regularly made by politicians of all levels. Chris Cillizza of The Washington Post felt the matter only appeared to be a scandal because the White House badly mishandled the response, and Chicago Tribune writer John Kass wrote, [...] "Offering a spot to an ambitious young politician to protect an old servile weakling isn't new. Presidents do it, governors do it. Big-city mayors really know how to do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The main depot-laying {{journey of}} the {{expedition}} began in September 1915.

This journey was completed on 26 January 1916. On the return journey Mackintosh and parson/photographer Arnold Spencer-Smith fell victims to scurvy and had to be carried on the sledge, drawn by Joyce, Ernest Wild, Dick Richards and Hayward. When the food situation became acute Hayward, by now showing scurvy symptoms himself, nevertheless went forward with Joyce and Richards to obtain life-saving food and fuel {{for the rest of the}} party. [...] Eventually, after suffering both physical and mental breakdown, Hayward was lashed to the sledge and on 18 March was hauled to the shelter at Hut Point where, since the doorway was iced up, he was hoisted in through the window. Spencer-Smith died and was buried in the ice; Mackintosh barely survived. Joyce had expected Hayward to die, but he too survived.|$|E
