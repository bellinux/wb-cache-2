5|$|I fell in {{love with}} him as a ten-year-old boy. I saw him in a play in New York... a very well-staged melodrama which was an {{enormous}} hit for about a year—it was made as a movie later with somebody else. He had the leading role, and I never forgot him. And through the years I'd seen him in movies—little things. And I could never forget that performance of his. He's always played very stereotyped parts in pictures but is one of the best actors I've ever known. I have such respect for him. You play next to <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> just feel the thing that you do with a big actor—this dynamo going on.|$|E
500|$|Hassan is Amir's closest {{childhood}} friend. He {{is described}} as having a China doll face, green eyes, and a harelip. Hosseini regards him as a flat character in terms of development; he is [...] "a lovely guy and you root for <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> love him but he's not complicated". The reader eventually discovers that Hassan is actually the son of Baba and Sanaubar, although Hassan never discovers this during his lifetime. Moreover, it would make Hassan a Pashtun according to tribal law and not Hazara as he's actually the son of Baba, and ironic for Assef to bully him as both Assef and Hassan are half Pashtuns. Hassan is later killed by the Taliban for refusal to abandon Amir's property.|$|E
500|$|The {{physicians}} {{could not}} agree on a diagnosis. Radcliffe thought he had scarlet fever, while others thought it was smallpox. They administered [...] "cordial powders and cordial juleps". Gloucester was bled, to which Radcliffe strongly objected. He told his colleagues, [...] "you have destroyed <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> may finish him". He prescribed blistering, which was no more effective. In great pain, Gloucester passed the evening of 28 July [...] "in great sighings and dejections of spirits... towards morning, he complained very much of his blisters." [...] Anne, who had spent an entire day and night by her son's bedside, now became so distressed that she fainted. However, by midday on 29 July, Gloucester was breathing more easily and his headache had diminished, leading to hopes that he would recover. The improvement was fleeting, and that evening, he was [...] "taken with a convulsing sort of breathing, a defect in swallowing and a total deprivation of all sense". Prince William died close to 1 a.m. on 30 July 1700, with his parents beside him. In the end, the physicians decided {{the cause of death}} was [...] "a malignant fever". An autopsy revealed severe swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck and an abnormal amount of fluid in the ventricles of his brain: [...] "four and a half ounces of a limpid humour were taken out." [...] A modern diagnosis is that Gloucester died of acute bacterial pharyngitis, with associated pneumonia. Had he lived, though, it is almost certain the prince would have succumbed to complications of his hydrocephalus.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{critical}} that Salk develop {{the trust of}} the U.S. public for his experiments and the mass tests that would become necessary. An associate of his noted, [...] "That boy really suffers when he sees a paralytic case. You look at <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> see him thinking, 'My God, this can be prevented'." [...] An article in Wisdom notes that at one point, [...] "he even thought of giving up virus research": ...|$|E
2500|$|Smith was {{credited}} with mentoring pitcher Denny McLain during the 1968 season. [...] McLain, who became the first pitcher since 1934 to win 30 games, went 31-6 with a 1.96 ERA, won the Cy Young Award and the American League Most Valuable Player Award. Asked about McLain's sometimes odd statements, Smith was protective, noting, [...] "This is a 24-year-old boy reaching for Utopia[...] [...] [...] You can't take the brashness away from <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't want to." ...|$|E

We're going to be fooling around out of my realm…and you may {{understand}} this stuff but I don't. What the hell are we getting into?' And Jack would patiently explain. And I {{had a great deal}} of confidence in <b>him</b> <b>and,</b> <b>you</b> know, if he said something, that, to me, was from the Bible. You could take it to the bank." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ringer {{is the son}} of Bishop Eugene and Darlene Ringer, who {{are both}} ministers. Ringer is a devout Christian. He owns a black belt in Karate. He majored in sociology. Ringer is known for his [...] "unselfish attitude", such as signing any {{autograph}} a fan asks for, and often does charity work. Michigan State Head coach Mark Dantonio said of Ringer, [...] "He's a total team player - it's not about <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> can't say enough about him as a person aside from his athletic abilities." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roy Claxton Acuff (September 15, 1903 – November 23, 1992) was an American {{country music}} singer, fiddler, and promoter. Known as the [...] "King of Country Music," [...] Acuff is often {{credited}} with moving the genre from its early string band and [...] "hoedown" [...] format {{to the star}} singer-based format that helped make it internationally successful. In 1952 Hank Williams told Ralph Gleason, [...] "He's the biggest singer this music ever knew. You booked <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> didn't worry about crowds. For drawing power in the South, it was Roy Acuff, then God." ...|$|E

If he is good, God will not leave <b>him</b> to <b>you</b> <b>and</b> if he is bad, then your knowing of his badness will make <b>you</b> safe from <b>him</b> <b>and</b> so <b>you</b> {{do not need to}} make him your enemy." ...|$|R

2500|$|Having been {{introduced}} earlier to the Essex county cricket captain Tom Pearce, Dodds was de-mobbed {{from the army}} in 1946 and joined Essex. At about this time, according to his later account in his autobiography, he joined Moral Re-Armament and embraced a form of active Christianity in which he lived his life according to [...] "advice" [...] which he received in conversations with God: [...] "You have a quiet time, in which you put the problem to <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> note what thoughts he puts into your mind in reply. You are not asking for anything, except advice." ...|$|E
2500|$|They {{studied the}} book and built Steve Davis's own {{technique}} {{on it in the}} 1970s. He started playing at the Lucania Snooker Club in Romford, where at the age of 18 the manager of the club brought his talent to the attention of Barry Hearn, chairman of the Lucania chain of snooker halls. Hearn became Davis' friend and manager. Paid £25 a match by Hearn, Davis toured the country, taking part in challenge matches against established professionals such as Ray Reardon, John Spencer and Alex Higgins. Around this time he was given the nickname [...] "Nugget" [...] because, according to Hearn, [...] "you could put your case of money on <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> {{knew you were going to}} get paid." ...|$|E
2500|$|Around 7:40 pm, {{almost an}} hour after Reginald Denny was rescued at Florence and Normandie, another beating was {{captured}} on videotape in that location. Fidel Lopez, a self-employed construction worker and Guatemalan immigrant, was pulled from his GMC pickup truck and robbed of nearly $2,000. Members of the rioters including Damian Williams smashed his forehead open with a car stereo as another rioter attempted to slice his ear off. After Lopez lost consciousness, the crowd spray-painted his chest, torso, and genitals black. He was eventually rescued by Rev. Bennie Newton, who told the rioters: [...] "Kill <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> have to kill me too." [...] Lopez survived the attack, but it took him years to fully recover and re-establish his business. Newton and Lopez became close friends until {{the death of the}} former in 1993.|$|E

[...] [Footnote: There is a difference amongst authorities how long the nestling hawk should be fed with flesh which has previously been washed.] ...|$|R

6000|$|And {{so it will}} be with you, my friends. [...] "If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, {{give him}} drink, for so thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head." [...] Thou shalt melt the {{hardness}} of his heart. Thou shalt warm the coldness of his heart. Nobleness in thee shall bring out in answer nobleness in <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> if not, thou hast done thy duty, and the Lord judge between <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>thee.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Critic Gunther Schuller declared, [...] "On {{one point}} there is {{universal}} agreement: Tatum's awesome technique." [...] That technique {{was marked by}} a calm physical demeanor and efficiency. [...] Tatum did not indulge in theatrical physical or facial expression. [...] The effortless gliding of his hands over difficult passages baffled most who witnessed the phenomenon. [...] He especially astonished other pianists to whom Tatum appeared to be [...] "playing the impossible." [...] Even when playing scintillating runs at high velocity, it appeared that his fingers hardly moved. [...] Hank Jones said: When I finally met him and {{got a chance to}} hear him play in person, it seemed as if he wasn't really exerting much effort, he had an effortless way of playing. It was deceptive. You'd watch <b>him</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> couldn't believe what was coming out, what was reaching your ears. He didn't have that much motion at the piano. He didn’t make a big show of moving around and waving his hands and going through all sorts of physical gyrations to produce the music that he produced, so that in itself is amazing. There had to be intense concentration there, but you couldn’t tell by just looking at him play.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Now you are {{a bigger}} fool even than I thought you, Billy Minns,' I said in anger. 'That man would have murdered me, I overcame <b>him</b> <b>and</b> made <b>him</b> fast, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> have let <b>him</b> go.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I am, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> can't stop me," [...] {{returned}} Matt spiritedly. [...] "I {{own that}} horse, {{or at least}} I own a half-interest in <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> if <b>you</b> dare to molest me you'll get into trouble." ...|$|R
