It is found that due to higher saturated inner stator steel in a CPM machine, it suffers from larger end effect than the SPM machine. Influence of armature reaction on end effect is investigated by a finite-element (FE) analysis, together with that of aspect ratio, i. e., axial stack length to stator outer diameter. Furthermore, {{it is found that}} in the CPM machine, the optimal PM arcs for the highest average electromagnetic torque predicted by 2 -D and 3 -D FE are different due to the variation of end effect with PM arc.

Similar to the single-stator surface-mounted PMMs (SS-PMMs), flexible rotor pole number, bipolar phase flux linkage, and symmetrical phase back electromotive force (EMF) are also obtained in PS-PMMs. Based on the same 12 / 10 stator/rotor pole number combination, PS-PMM-I (PMs located in the <b>inner</b> <b>stator)</b> and PS-PMM-II (PMs located in the outer stator) exhibit 120 % and 160 % higher phase back EMFs as well as 120 % and 139 % larger average torques, respectively, than the SS-PMM together almost without scarifying the PM utilization efficiency under the same machine size and the same rated copper loss.

However, the vacuum systems to support these sensors remain large, heavy, and power-hungry. To meet this need, a miniaturized vacuum system was developed based on a very small, rugged, and inexpensive-to-manufacture molecular drag pump (MDP). The MDP is enabled by a miniature, very-high-speed (200, 000 rpm), rugged, low-power, brushless DC motor optimized for wide temperature operation and long life. The key advantages of the pump are reduced cost and improved ruggedness compared to other mechanical hig-hvacuum pumps. The machining of the rotor and stators is very simple compared to that necessary to fabricate rotor and stator blades for other pump designs. Also, the symmetry of the rotor is such that dynamic balancing of the rotor will likely not be necessary. Finally, the number of parts in the unit is cut by nearly a factor of three over competing designs. The new pump forms the heart of a complete vacuum system optimized to support analytical instruments in terrestrial applications and on spacecraft and planetary landers.
