25|$|There {{is nothing}} solid {{left in the}} Players' Protective Association. There has been no {{activity}} {{on the part of}} the present officials, and there will be none. The organization has been allowed to die because the members have seen nothing in it to interest them. Some are not pleased with the officers; others object to the paying of dues, while others still believe that they can do better by themselves than by acting in concert with all the other players; and so the Players' Protective Association gradually is being allowed to die out. One hears but little of it now, and in a year from now will hear less. It would have been a <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> players if they had been true to its principles and the officials had been active in carrying out all its aims and laws. However, there was failure on all sides, and the result is that the organization gradually is fading out of existence.|$|E
25|$|At {{the later}} conventions, in Adelaide in 1897, in Sydney later {{the same year}} and in Melbourne in early 1898, there were changes to the earlier draft. In Adelaide, {{the name of the}} court was changed from Supreme Court of Australia to High Court of Australia. Many people also opposed the new court {{completely}} replacing the Privy Council: many large businesses, particularly those which were subsidiaries of British companies or regularly traded with the United Kingdom, preferred for business reasons to keep the colonies under the unified jurisdiction of the British courts, and petitioned the conventions to that effect. Other arguments posited against removing Privy Council appeals were that Australian judges were of a poorer quality than English ones, and that without the Council's oversight, the law in the colonies risked becoming different from English law. Some politicians, such as Sir George Dibbs, supported the petitioners, but others, including Alfred Deakin, supported the design of the court as it was. Inglis Clark took the view that the possibility of divergence was a <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> law could adapt appropriately to Australian circumstances. Despite the debate, the portions of the draft dealing with the court remained largely unchanged, as the delegates focused on different matters.|$|E
500|$|There {{were also}} {{disagreements}} within the NSDAP {{leadership on the}} spiritual implications of cultivating a 'Germanic history' in their ideological program. Hitler was highly critical of Himmler's esoteric völkisch interpretation of the 'Germanic mission'. When Himmler denounced Charlemagne in a speech as [...] "the butcher of the Saxons", Hitler stated {{that this was not}} a 'historical crime' but in fact a <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> subjugation of Widukind had brought Western culture into what eventually became Germany. He also disapproved of the pseudoarchaeological projects which Himmler organized through his Ahnenerbe organization, such as excavations of pre-historic Germanic sites: ...|$|E
500|$|Opposition Leader Pearson stated, [...] "He {{was a man}} who shirked no duty, faltered in no task, was daunted by no obstacle. He {{got things}} done, and they were <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> country he served so well and so long." ...|$|R
5000|$|Somers' {{mother and}} brother posted a video online in {{response}} to the AQAP's video. In the video, they pleaded with AQAP to [...] "show mercy," [...] and appealed for Somers' release. They also said Somers was only [...] "trying to do <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Yemeni population." ...|$|R
5000|$|Somers was {{described}} by his friend as [...] "a great man with a kind heart who really loves the Yemeni people and the country ... He was so dedicated in trying to help change Yemen's future, to do <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> people that he didn't leave the country Yemen his entire time here." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{foundation}} of the Glyndebourne Festival in 1934 was another <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> LSO, as its players made up nearly {{the entirety of the}} festival orchestra. An important additional source of income for the orchestra was the film industry. In March 1935 the LSO recorded Arthur Bliss's incidental music for Alexander Korda's film Things to Come. According to the LSO's website the recording took 14 full orchestral sessions and [...] "started a veritable revolution in film production history.... For the first time, music for the cinema, previously regarded as a lowly art form, captured the attention of classical music scholars and enthusiasts, music critics and the film and music public. The LSO had begun its long historic journey as the premier film orchestra." ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Adults Only" [...] (AO) rating has {{attracted}} a negative stigma among the video game industry—one which {{has been criticized for}} stifling the ability for developers to have creative freedom in their portrayal of certain themes in a game, at the risk of being commercially unviable due to publishers' objections to AO-rated content. AO-rated games cannot be published for major video game console platforms, and most retailers do not stock AO-rated games. ESRB President Patricia Vance argued that applying self-censorship to ensure marketability was a compromise that is [...] "true in every entertainment medium", but still believed that the idea of the AO rating eventually becoming acceptable would be a <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ESRB system. The stigma is primarily affected by a perception by the industry and other activists that video games are generally considered children's products; for example, the availability of a Wii version of Manhunt 2 was condemned by Senator Hillary Clinton over fears that children could use the game's motion controls to act out the game's [...] "many graphic torture scenes and murders".|$|E
2500|$|.....A {{careful study}} of the matter {{convinced}} me that after all it was a <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> future of the school that the present one could not be disturbed, for therein lay the suggestion for a design unique in high schools of the country... A quadrangle enclosed by buildings devoted to various departments of school work.|$|E

5000|$|Within {{an hour of}} the record-setting auction closing, Senator Reid {{addressed}} the issue again {{on the floor of}} the Senate stating, [...] "I strongly believe when we can put our differences aside, even Harry Reid and Rush Limbaugh, we should do that and try to accomplish <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> American people." ...|$|R
5000|$|Sara Netzley from EW, {{gave the}} episode a [...] "B+" [...] grade and wrote, [...] "And despite having to watch Hank inform every single other {{character}} {{on the show}} that Nick is a wanted man, tonight’s season premiere was a tightly plotted slice of character-driven storytelling that heralds <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> final 13 episodes of the little fairy tale show that could." ...|$|R
2500|$|Meat {{produced}} {{in a laboratory}} (called in vitro meat) may be more environmentally sustainable than regularly produced meat. Reactions of vegetarians vary. Rearing {{a relatively small number}} of grazing animals can be beneficial, as the Food Climate Research Network at Surrey University reports: [...] "A little bit of livestock production is probably a <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> environment.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011, {{the band}} {{released}} their fifth studio album, The Unforgiving, {{the biggest change}} in their musical direction. Although being largely well received by critics, some reviewers disliked the changes, with Q magazine calling the album [...] "The metal T'Pau". Besides that, some critics found the [...] "1980s pop, rock and metal" [...] influences a <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> band.|$|E
2500|$|For {{a couple}} of months the Blongers were toasted as the {{solution}} to the town's law enforcement problem (a previous marshal, Milt Yarberry, had murdered two citizens). When Sam and Lou were joined briefly by brother Joe, a prospector in the nearby Cerrillos Hills, a local newspaper wrote: [...] "The three brothers are all of them young, nervy and square western men {{and it would be a}} <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> town if they were all on the police force." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{day of the}} meeting, {{members of}} the Idle No More {{movement}} organized protests on Parliament Hill (drawing an estimated 3000 demonstrators), and in cities across Canada. Idle No More spokesperson Pam Palmater, who ran against Atleo <b>for</b> <b>the</b> position of National Chief with the AFN, said in a CBC discussion that the diverse positions expressed among the AFN chiefs [...] "doesn't mean <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> AFN".|$|R

50|$|Jennifer's {{constant}} urging that he do {{the right}} thing ended up having a huge effect on Jack. The newspaper business was also a very good influence on him, and before he knew it, he found himself wanting to do <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sake of doing them, and not <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sake of being thought a hero. He tried to subtly get closer to Steve, Adrienne and Jo; Steve was very leery of the purported change.|$|R
60|$|About {{two hours}} after he was gone, came a Leadenhall basket-woman, with a whole load of <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> mouth (the {{particulars}} are not to the purpose), and brought orders to get supper by eight o'clock. However, I {{did not intend to}} begin to dress anything till I saw him; and he gave me time enough, for he came before seven, so that Amy, who had gotten one to help her, got everything ready in time.|$|R
50|$|Tom {{was sick}} with remorse, but Tommy {{convinced}} {{him that he could}} still do good. Tom broke the spell on Dragonzord and sent him back to the sea. The White and Green Rangers went back in time to colonial Angel Grove to destroy the Rat Monsters the Wizard had created to torture the other Rangers. Afterwards, Tom decided to stay in colonial Angel Grove so he could do some <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> citizens, yet keeping the Green Ranger's powers.|$|R

5000|$|In June 2013 {{the band}} {{released}} another new song, [...] "Black Days Away," [...] {{as a free}} download on their website, and announced that their sixth LP was officially under way.

5000|$|Google's {{declared}} code {{of conduct}} is [...] "Don't be evil", a phrase which they {{went so far as}} to include in their prospectus (aka [...] "S-1") for their 2004 IPO, noting that [...] "We believe strongly that in the long term, we will be better served—as shareholders and in all other ways—by a company that does <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> world even if we forgo some short term gains."

50|$|Despite being a knight, McCamley {{publicly}} {{opposed the}} decision by Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott to reintroduce the honorary titles of knights and dames in 2014, describing the move as unnecessary. McCamley said that once {{the decision was made}} to move to an Australian honours system, the decision should have been final instead of the country wavering between the two honours systems. He also said that while he Australians who have done <b>good</b> <b>things</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> country should be recognised, he thought the Australian system had been running too long for it to be changed.|$|R
