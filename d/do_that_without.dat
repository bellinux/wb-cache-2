25|$|The {{reason for}} this {{extremely}} small size limit of 0.01µm {{is because of the}} consideration of Gene Transfer Agents (GTAs). These randomly incorporate segments of the host genome and can transfer them to other evolutionarily distant hosts, and <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>without</b> killing the new host. In this way many archaea and bacteria can swap DNA with each other. This raises the possibility that Martian life, if it has a common origin with Earth life in the distant past, could swap DNA with Earth micro-organisms in the same way.|$|E
500|$|David Orr of The New York Times {{describes}} Jon as [...] "a complex, {{thoughtful and}} basically good character". David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, the creators and executive {{producers of the}} television adaptation of the series, explain that Jon {{is one of several}} characters in the series who must [...] "face hard truths about the world they live in, and adapt themselves to those truths" [...] because [...] "The struggle many of them face is how to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>without</b> losing their grip on who they are." [...] Ned Stark teaches all his children about leadership, selflessness, duty and honor. Following his father's example becomes more difficult as Jon faces challenges to his identity as a man, a Stark, and a brother of the Night's Watch. Benioff and Weiss note that [...] "Jon Snow tries to live with honor, while knowing that honor often gets his family members murdered." [...] Writing for Variety about the season 6 episode [...] "Battle of the Bastards", Laura Prudom suggests that Jon [...] "has the same shortcomings" [...] as his father: [...] "he fights with honor against opponents who are all too willing to use that predictable morality against him".|$|E

Creators David Benioff and D. B. Weiss later noted that Jon [...] "tries {{to live with}} honor, while knowing that honor often gets his family members murdered". They explained that {{he is one of}} several characters in the series who must [...] "face hard truths about the world they live in, and adapt themselves to those truths. The struggle many of them face is how to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>without</b> losing their grip on who they are." [...] Matt Fowler of IGN wrote in 2013 that while Jon and Daenerys' storylines in season 1 and season 2 [...] "felt very separate" [...] {{from the rest of the}} series' plot, for the first time in season 3, [...] "Jon's entire situation felt incorporated into the larger picture." [...] Fowler also added that Jon's [...] "oath-breaking romance with Ygritte added a lot of heat to the story". In May 2015, International Business Times called Jon [...] "clearly the most popular character" [...] of the series.|$|E

2500|$|In 1908, Aero Club members {{including}} Charles Rolls, described {{accounts of}} the Wright Brothers' demonstrations of their aircraft at Le Mans in France. Oswald Short reportedly said to Eustace [...] "This is the finish of ballooning: we must begin building aeroplanes at once, and we can't <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>without</b> Horace!" [...] Oswald succeeded in persuading Horace to join them, and in November 1908 they registered their partnership under the name Short Brothers. They soon started building two aeroplanes, for Charles Rolls and for Francis McClean, then they established an additional factory at Leysdown, Isle of Sheppey, later relocated to Eastchurch. In early 1909, Short Brothers {{signed an agreement with}} the Wright brothers to manufacture copies of Wright Flyers for sale under licence, and thus became the World's first aircraft manufacturer.|$|E
2500|$|Pollock {{observed}} American Indian sandpainting {{demonstrations in}} the 1940s. Referring to {{his style of}} painting on the floor, Pollock stated, “I feel nearer, more {{a part of the}} painting, since this way I can walk round it, work from the four sides and literally be in the painting. This is akin to the methods of the Indian sand painters of the West.” Other influences on his drip technique include the Mexican muralists and Surrealist automatism. Pollock denied reliance on [...] "the accident"; he usually had an idea of how he wanted a particular piece to appear. His technique combined the movement of his body, over which he had control, the viscous flow of paint, the force of gravity, and the absorption of paint into the canvas. It was a mixture of controllable and uncontrollable factors. Flinging, dripping, pouring, and spattering, he would move energetically around the canvas, almost as if in a dance, and would not stop until he saw what he wanted to see. As another important influence can be cited Wolfgang Paalen's article on Totem Art of the indigenous people of British Columbia and his Fumage paintings which he had seen at Julien Levy's exhibition of Paalen's surrealist paintings in 1940. Pollock owned a signed and dedicated copy of the Amerindian Number of Paalen's magazine (DYN 4-5, 1943), in which the revolutionary space concept in totemist art from the North-West-Coast is broadly discussed from an artist's point of view. Another strong impact must have been Paalen's fumage technique, as it was the surrealist technique with the most magic appeal for those painters who looked for new ways of making appear what was called the unseen or the possible. Fumage was presented also in Matta's workshop about which Steven Naifeh reports: »Once, when Matta was demonstrating the Surrealist technique [...] Fumage, Jackson [...] turned to (Peter) Busa and said in a stage whisper: ›I can <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>without</b> the smoke.‹« Pollock's painter friend Fritz Bultman even stated (hinting at the revolutionary possibility-space of Paalen): [...] "It was Wolfgang Paalen, who started it all." ...|$|E
2500|$|In this situation, {{several groups}} {{belonging}} to four different circles (the royal court, the antifascist parties, the fascism {{and the general}} Staff) started {{to look for a}} way out. Aristocrats such as Crown Princess Maria José, members of the upper classes and politicians belonging to the pre-Fascist elites, independently started plots aiming at establishing contacts with the Allies. Unfortunately, none of them understood that the war had become ideological with the declaration of Casablanca stating that the Allies would only accept unconditional surrender. [...] Moreover, despite the Crown Princess' involvement, the Anglo-Americans expected a move from higher-placed personalities, like the King, and disregarded contacts with these groups. The antifascist parties, weakened by 20 years of dictatorship, were still in an embryonic state. Moreover, all except the communists and the republicans of the Partito d’Azione waited for a signal from Victor Emmanuel, but in vain: the King's character, realist and skeptical at the same time, his fears, his constitutional scruples, {{and the fact that the}} monarchy was almost certainly finished regardless of how the war turned out contributed to his inaction. The King had considerable contempt towards the old pre-Fascist politicians, whom he ironically called [...] "revenants" [...] ("ghosts" [...] in French) and didn't entirely trust those who claimed that the Anglo-Americans would not seek to exact revenge upon Italy. Last but not least, Victor Emmanuel retained his trust in Mussolini, and he hoped that the Duce could save the situation once again. Consequently, the King kept his own counsel and isolated himself from all those who tried to learn his intentions. Among them was the new Chief of the General Staff, General Vittorio Ambrosio, a Piemontese, [...] "not of high intelligence", but devoted to the King and hostile to the Germans. Ambrosio was persuaded that the war was lost for Italy, but he never thought to take a personal initiative to change the situation without first consulting with Victor Emmanuel. On the other side Ambrosio, helped by his right-hand man, Giuseppe Castellano, and by Giacomo Carboni (both of whom would play key roles in the happenings which would lead to the armistice of 8 September 1943), slowly proceeded to occupy several key positions in the armed forces with officials devoted to the king. Moreover, he tried to bring back to Italy as many forces as possible among those which were abroad, but it was difficult to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>without</b> raising the suspicions of the Germans.|$|E
