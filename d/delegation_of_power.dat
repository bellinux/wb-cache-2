5|$|She {{has been}} the subject of romantic and ideologically-driven biographies by ancient and modern writers. The Augustan History is the clearest example of an ideological account of Zenobia's life, and its author {{acknowledged}} that it was written to criticize the emperor Gallienus. According to the Augustan History, Gallienus was weak because he allowed a woman to rule part of the empire and Zenobia was an abler sovereign than the emperor. The narrative changed as the Augustan History moved on to the life of Claudius Gothicus, a lauded and victorious emperor, with the author characterizing Zenobia's protection of the eastern frontier as a wise <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> by Claudius. When the Augustan History reached the biography of Aurelian, the author's view of Zenobia changed dramatically; the queen is depicted as a guilty, insolent, proud coward. Her wisdom was discredited and her actions deemed the result of manipulation by advisers.|$|E
25|$|In {{order for}} custom {{to become a}} source of law, it must be {{approved}} by the competent legislator. Custom in canon law is not simply created by the people through their constant performance of a certain act, but it is the constant performance of a certain act, with the intention of making a custom, which is approved by the competent legislator, thereby acquiring the force of law. This is because of the Catholic ecclesiological teaching on the constitution of the Catholic Church, which states that Christ constituted the Church by divine <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> to the hierarchical authorities; the Church was not created by the consent of the governed, but by the direct will of Christ.|$|E

2500|$|In a dissenting opinion, Justice Stephen Breyer {{contended that}} the {{objective}} of the Act was constitutionally proper and was consistent with powers that the President has held in the past, stating that the Act [...] "does not violate any specific textual constitutional command, nor does it violate any implicit Separation of Powers principle." [...] He extensively refers to many different cases which support the <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> by the Congress, and primarily suggests that the Act is an efficient means by which a constitutionally legitimate end may be achieved.|$|E

5000|$|The {{doctrine}} of nondelegation is {{the theory that}} one branch of government must not authorize another entity to exercise the power or function which it is constitutionally authorized to exercise itself. It is [...] or [...] in all written constitutions that impose a strict structural separation <b>of</b> <b>powers.</b> It is usually applied in questions <b>of</b> constitutionally improper <b>delegations</b> <b>of</b> <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> {{any of the three}} branches of government to either of the other, to the administrative state, or to private entities.

2500|$|Stevens extolled the {{benefits}} of cooperative federalism. Federal direction of state officials in this manner is analogous to ordering the mass inoculation of children to forestall an epidemic, or directing state officials {{to respond to a}} terrorist threat. He was very concerned with the ability of the federal government to respond to a national emergency and did not believe that [...] "there is anything in the 10th amendment 'in historical understanding and practice, {{in the structure of the}} Constitution, or in the jurisprudence of this Court,' that forbids the enlistment of state officers to make that response effective."

60|$|While, however, {{it is thus}} {{distinctly}} {{understood that}} the power of the teacher is supreme, that all the power rests in him, and that he alone is responsible for its exercise, there ought, to be a very free and continual <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> to the pupils. As much business as is possible, should be committed to them. They should be interested as much as possible in the affairs of the school, and led to take an active part in carrying them forward; though they should, all the time, distinctly understand, that it is only delegated power which they exercise, and that the teacher can, at any time, revoke what he has granted, and alter or annul at pleasure, any of their decisions. By this plan, we have the responsibility resting where it ought to rest, and yet the boys are trained to business, and led to take an active interest in the welfare of the school. Trust is reposed in them, which may be greater or less, as they are able to bear. All the good effects of reposing trust and confidence, and committing the management of important business to the pupils will be secured, without the dangers which would result from the entire surrender of the management of the institution into their hands.|$|E

6000|$|But {{there is}} another serious part (what is not so?) in this affair. Let us suppose that the power for which Mr. Hastings contends, a power which no {{sovereign}} ever did or ever can vest in any of his subjects, namely, his own sovereign authority, to be conveyed by the act of Parliament to any man or body of men whatsoever; it certainly was never given to Mr. Hastings. The powers given by the act of 1773 were formal and official; they were given, not to the Governor-General, but to the major vote of the board, as a board, on discussion amongst themselves, in their public character and capacity; and their acts in that character and capacity were to be ascertained by records and minutes of council. The despotic acts exercised by Mr. Hastings were done merely in his private character; and, {{if they had been}} moderate and just, would still be the acts of an usurped authority, and without any one of the legal modes of proceeding which could give him competence for the most trivial exertion of power. There was no proposition or deliberation whatsoever in council, no minute on record, by circulation or otherwise, to authorize his proceedings; no <b>delegation</b> <b>of</b> <b>power</b> to impose a fine, or to take any step to deprive the Rajah of Benares of his government, his property, or his liberty. The minutes of consultation assign to his journey a totally different object, duty, and destination. Mr. Wheler, at his desire, tells us long after, that he had a confidential conversation with him on various subjects, of which this was the principal, in which Mr. Hastings notified to him his secret intentions; [...] "and that he bespoke his support of the measures which he intended to pursue towards him (the Rajah)." [...] This confidential discourse, and bespeaking of support, could give him no power, in opposition to an express act of Parliament, and the whole tenor of the orders of the Court of Directors.|$|E
