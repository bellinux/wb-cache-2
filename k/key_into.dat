5|$|The {{staff was}} then hidden deep below the castle and inscribed with {{powerful}} magical symbols to protect it. Before he died, Karnath broke the <b>key</b> <b>into</b> sixteen pieces and hid them throughout his castle. Centuries later, an aristocrat adventurer, Sir Arthur Pendragon, ventures inside the castle {{in order to}} defuse the orb before midnight. Should he fail, its power would be unleashed, and the resulting inter-dimensional rip would wipe out the human race.|$|E
5|$|During their play-date, Bart {{notices that}} Ralph's father has a police master key capable of opening any door in Springfield. Bart and Ralph thus steal {{the key and}} decide to enter several closed stores at night. After encountering Nelson and his gang, the boys go to a {{condemned}} penitentiary. When Ralph objects because he is afraid, the bullies leave, but not before tossing the <b>key</b> <b>into</b> the penitentiary. Ralph and Bart enter the prison to retrieve the key, {{and in the process}} stumble onto a room housing an old electric chair. After testing out the chair, the two flee when an elderly guard approaches.|$|E

25|$|Libraries {{have used}} RFID {{to replace the}} {{barcodes}} on library items. The tag can contain identifying information or may just be a <b>key</b> <b>into</b> a database. An RFID system may replace or supplement bar codes and may offer another method of inventory management and self-service checkout by patrons. It can also act as a security device, taking {{the place of the}} more traditional electromagnetic security strip.|$|E
500|$|In open {{addressing}} solutions to this problem, the data structure is an array [...] (the hash table) whose cells [...] (when nonempty) each store a single key–value pair. A hash function {{is used to}} map each <b>key</b> <b>into</b> the cell of [...] where that key should be stored, typically scrambling the keys so that keys with similar values are not placed near {{each other in the}} table. A hash collision occurs when the hash function maps a <b>key</b> <b>into</b> a cell that is already occupied by a different key. Linear probing is a strategy for resolving collisions, by placing the new <b>key</b> <b>into</b> the closest following empty cell.|$|E

[...] The key may also be provided by a CCID for reading a cryptographic smartcard. [...] Using CCID provides additional benefits beyond just storing the key file on an external USB thumb drive, because the CCID protocol hides the private key using a cryptographic processor embedded in the smartcard; this prevents the key from being stolen by simply being read off the media on which it is stored.|$|E

2500|$|As in many coastal states, seafood {{is readily}} available. Shellfish is {{extremely}} popular, with clams {{being used in}} multiple ways. The quahog is a large local clam usually used in a chowder. (The word quahog comes from the Narragansett Indian word [...] "poquauhock"; see A <b>Key</b> <b>into</b> the Language of America by Roger Williams 1643.) It is also ground and mixed with stuffing (and sometimes spicy minced sausage) and then baked in its shell to form a stuffie. Steamed clams are also a very popular dish. Calamari (squid) is sliced into rings and fried and is served as an appetizer in most Italian restaurants, typically Sicilian-style (i.e., tossed with sliced banana peppers and with marinara sauce on the side).|$|E
2500|$|An Electronic Product Code (EPC) is {{one common}} type of data stored in a tag. When written into the tag by an RFID printer, the tag {{contains}} a 96-bit string of data. [...] The first eight bits are a header which identifies the version of the protocol. The next 28 bits identify the organization that manages {{the data for this}} tag; the organization number is assigned by the EPCGlobal consortium. The next 24 bits are an object class, identifying the kind of product; the last 36 bits are a unique serial number for a particular tag. These last two fields are set by the organization that issued the tag. Rather like a URL, the total electronic product code number {{can be used as a}} <b>key</b> <b>into</b> a global database to uniquely identify a particular product.|$|E

Captain Arthur Cumming was appointed in command, and saw considerable active service. On one occasion he took Conflict and [...] (Captain Astley Cooper <b>Key)</b> <b>into</b> Libau (modern Liepāja in Latvia), occupied the town and seized eight Russian merchant vessels, without firing a single shot. She was commanded by Commander William Charles Chamberlain at Devonport in 1855 and by Commander Cochran in the Mediterranean in 18567. She recommissioned in August 1857 and served on the west coast of Africa.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} escape his father, Clark decides {{to use a}} kryptonite key to destroy his spaceship. When Clark puts the kryptonite <b>key</b> <b>into</b> the spaceship, Beck and his FX team tried to create a [...] "virus/fungus" [...] growth from the key slot to {{simulate}} [...] "some sort of fractal decay". Mike McCormick worked specifically {{on the process of}} destroying the ship, giving the ship the appearance that it has a [...] "nasty skin infection" [...] that is spreading as if it is caught in the circulatory system. Next, Beck had to tackle the problem of the ship's final destruction. Originally, it was intended to have the ship explode, but no one wanted to have to rebuild the Kent farm. Instead, they settled on a giant EMP wave given off by the ship the moment it is destroyed. Entity FX created a beam of light that shot vertically up from the ship's location and then fell back down expanding into a [...] "ripple that spread across the land". This beam of light would create a crater where the storm cellar was, which was dug prior to filming and digitally covered up so as to keep the illusion. One of the final shots of the episode was of Lex watching as his plane crashed into the ocean. In a homage to Robert Zemeckis's Cast Away, Entity FX crafted a digital effect of the ocean water flooding Lex's plane as it hits the ocean. The scene is reminiscent of the same scene in Cast Away where Tom Hanks's character also watches as the ocean water floods his plane as he crash lands in the ocean.|$|E
2500|$|Negative reviews {{came from}} Xan Brooks of The Guardian, {{who gave the}} film one star, {{describing}} it as [...] "a primped and simpering folly, the turkey that dreamed it was a peacock. Brooks predicted that the film [...] "may even surpass 2008's Filth and Wisdom, Madonna's calamitous first outing as a film-maker. Her direction is so all over the shop that it barely qualifies as direction at all." [...] Pointing out a scene, he added that [...] "Madonna has Wallis bound on stage to dance with a Masai tribesman while Pretty Vacant blares on the soundtrack. But why? What point is she making? That social-climbing Wallis-Simpson was the world's first punk-rocker?" [...] Todd McCarthy from The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film resembled a documentary of a woman out on a shopping expedition. McCarthy felt that the storyline was especially dreary during the portrayal of the love affair between Wally and Evgeni. [...] "For the audience, Wally, despite Cornish's gentle and warm presence, offers very little in terms of personal interest or as a <b>key</b> <b>into</b> the world {{of one of the}} last century's most discussed couples." [...] However, McCarthy praised cinematographer Hagen Bogdaski's work. Oliver Lyttelton of indieWire also slammed the film stating that [...] "the use of music is horrible" [...] and [...] "We’ve never looked forward to Madonna going back on tour more, if only because it means that we’ll know, for certain, that she won’t be using that time to direct another movie." [...] Emma Pritchard from Grazia added that [...] "Wallis Simpson was the kind of woman who was accused of being more style than substance– and that, alas, is what Madonna has recreated on screen with W.E." [...] Mark Adams of Screen Daily singled out Riseborough's performance as a [...] "highlight", but overall felt that the film was disappointing. Leslie Felperin from Variety was disappointed in the film, saying that it is [...] "burdened with risible dialogue and weak performances". Felperin felt that the reason for the film's downfall was its script, which attended to the costumes and fashion more than the actual story, which she felt had much potential, but was unused.|$|E
