40|$|Abstractâ€”This paper {{deals with}} the problem of thermal and {{mechanical}} shocks, which rising during operation, mostly at interrupted cut. Here will be solved their impact on the cutting edge tool life, the impact of coating technology on resistance to shocks and experimental determination of tool life in <b>heating</b> <b>flame.</b> Resistance of removable cutting edges against thermal and mechanical shock is an important indicator of quality as well as its abrasion resistance. Breach of the edge or its crumble may occur due to cyclic loading. We can observe it not only during the interrupted cutting (milling, turning areas abandoned hole or slot), but also in continuous cutting. This is due to the volatility of cutting force on cutting. Frequency of the volatility in this case depends on the type of rising chips (chip size element). For difficult-to-machine materials such as austenitic steel particularly happened at higher cutting speeds for the localization of plastic deformation in the shear plane and for the inception of separate elements substantially continuous chips. This leads to variations of cutting forces substantially greater than for other types of steel. During the uninterrupted cutting the cutting edge is cyclically loaded due to period oscillation of the cutting force main component. The frequency is given by the character of shaving element size [1]. Experiments have shown that during cutting of hard to machine materials with higher cutting speeds, for example austenitic steel, plastic deformation occurs in the shearing plane, in which the elements of continuous shaving are removed. This leads to large variations in the cutting force in these types of steels under the given cutting conditions. The amplitude of the main cutting force component in comparison with a different type of steel is shown on the fig. 1 to illustrate characteristics of a fatigue failure, abrasive wear and cutting edge crumbling away...|$|E

40|$|In this work, the {{existing}} understanding of flame spread dynamics is enhanced through an extensive {{study of the}} <b>heat</b> transfer from <b>flames</b> spreading vertically upwards across 5 cm wide, 20 cm tall samples of extruded Poly (Methyl Methacrylate) (PMMA). These experiments have provided highly spatially resolved measurements of <b>flame</b> to surface <b>heat</b> flux and material burning rate at the critical length scale of interest, {{with a level of}} accuracy and detail unmatched by previous empirical or computational studies. Using these measurements, a wall flame model was developed that describes a <b>flameâ€™s</b> <b>heat</b> feedback profile (both in the continuous flame region and the thermal plume above) solely as a function of material burning rate. 	Additional experiments were conducted to measure <b>flame</b> <b>heat</b> flux and sample mass loss rate as flames spread vertically upwards over the surface of seven other commonly used polymers, two of which are glass reinforced composite materials. Using these measurements, our wall flame model has been generalized such that it can predict <b>heat</b> feedback from <b>flames</b> supported by a wide range of materials. For the seven materials tested here â€“ which present a varied range of burning behaviors including dripping, polymer melt flow, sample burnout, and heavy soot formation â€“ model-predicted <b>flame</b> <b>heat</b> flux has been shown to match experimental measurements (taken across the full length of the flame) with an average accuracy of 3. 9 kW m- 2 (approximately 10 â€“ 15 % of peak measured <b>flame</b> <b>heat</b> flux). 	This <b>flame</b> model has since been coupled with a powerful solid phase pyrolysis solver, ThermaKin 2 D, which computes the transient rate of gaseous fuel production of constituents of a pyrolyzing solid in response to an external heat flux, based on fundamental physical and chemical properties. Together, this unified model captures the two fundamental controlling mechanisms of upward flame spread â€“ gas phase <b>flame</b> <b>heat</b> transfer and solid phase material degradation. This has enabled simulations of flame spread dynamics with a reasonable computational cost and accuracy beyond that of current models. This unified model of material degradation provides the framework to quantitatively study material burning behavior in response {{to a wide range of}} common fire scenarios...|$|R
