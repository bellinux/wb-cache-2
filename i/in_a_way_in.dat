Writing for AllMusic, Heather Phares described the track as an [...] "improbable but entertaining piece of country-rap", and distinguished it as a stand-out track from Bangerz. Marah Eakin from The A.V. Club opined that its [...] "progressive" [...] production {{was similar to}} a [...] "Scale-era Matthew Herbert", and commented that its lyrical content [...] " [...] the song in a silly Bonnie and Clyde direction". Nick Catucci from Entertainment Weekly was complimentary towards the [...] "winningly nutty Pharrell production", while Kyle Fowle from Slant Magazine commented that Cyrus [...] "explores ideas of femininity with a sinister, determined edge" [...] by assuming {{the position of the}} [...] "other woman" [...] mentioned in [...] "Before He Cheats" [...] by Carrie Underwood. Writing for PopMatters, Evan Sawdey described [...] "4x4" [...] as an [...] "almost throwaway squaredance of a club song ... complete with some accordion work", and suggested that it was the most inventive track from the record because it was [...] "absurd, ridiculous, and actually playful <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> which these other Bangerz aren't." ...|$|E

Individuals describing themselves as a [...] "private group" [...] had met with a senior figure within the Liberal Party of Australia in a hotel in Sydney, and offered him a significant amount of money by way of an anonymous donation. The book's source recounted the events: [...] "They said 'We are a private group'. I asked them if they voted. It was a testing question. They said they didn't. It was a very short discussion." [...] The organisation's members are instructed that government is controlled by God, and they are told not to vote in elections. [...] "We're in the business of ideas and so are the Exclusive Brethren. I regard many of the party's views and those of the Exclusive Brethren as inconsistent. What the [...] Party stands for should not be confused {{in the mind of the}} electorate by the acceptance of donations from fringe groups. In my view, if you accept this money, you're arguably accepting some of their opinions," [...] said the book's source, explaining that he had turned down the offer of funds from the organisation.|$|E

James Poniewozik of Time magazine {{concluded that it}} [...] "showed the stakes behind its characters' paper-pushing lives {{in a way it}} hasn't since Michael Scott left Scranton." [...] He called the first half a [...] "wacky ensemble show", but said that the last part featured elements that allowed the audience to [...] "all but hear the old machinery [...] waking up and sliding into place". Poniewozik stated that Jim and Pam's fight was [...] "believable in its arc and its parameters" [...] and that both characters were presented <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> which their plights were understandable. Ally Serrigran of Hollywood.com wrote that the [...] "episode was one worth tuning in for." [...] She felt that, for fans of the show who had left when Steve Carell departed, [...] "Customer Loyalty" [...] was the right episode for them {{to come back to the}} series. She called the fight between Jim and Pam [...] "jarring in and of itself". Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald commented on the fight between Jim and Pam, writing that it [...] "felt just like the kind of argument that two real people would have." [...] Brett Harrison Davinger of the California Literary Review wrote that the episode was [...] "fine" [...] and was composed of [...] "several small storylines, all of which worked". Davinger called the ending [...] "odd" [...] but [...] "effective".|$|E

A writer for Network Ten's Neighbours website described Sonya has having a shady past and wanting to set up a new life for herself in Erinsborough. Sonya used to have alcohol, drug and gambling addictions, but she has worked hard to overcome them. Morey told a reporter from Channel 5 that she is similar to Sonya morally and ethically, plus they both want the best for the people they love. However, Sonya occasionally goes about things <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> which Morey said she did not understand. The actress also struggled to understand the place of darkness that Sonya has been in too. When asked if her character could ever escape her past, Morey replied [...] "I don't think she will every truly escape her past because ultimately I don't think she should. If she doesn't have it there as a reminder and a good motivator to help her stay on track." [...] Morey revealed she would like to see Sonya reach her potential as a mother in the future.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the home}} front, the Canadian {{government}} was actively encouraging {{young men to}} enlist in the Royal Forces by enticing them {{with the promise of}} adventure in Europe, reminding them of their civil duty. The message propagated by the government to defend and serve resonated with women as well. Essentially, a woman with a nursing certificate held in her hand a ticket to independence and adventure. There was little doubt that the active service posters targeting Canadian men struck nurses more forcibly than messages pleading women to knit furiously and economize the home front. More than any previous opportunity, nursing allowed Canadian women to serve the nation <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>in</b> which they were uniquely qualified. Women joined the war effort with enthusiastic patriotism and a determination to prove their usefulness. By 1917, the Canadian Army Medical Corps (C.A.M.C.) included 2,030 nurses. A total of 3,141 Canadian nurses served in the C.A.M.C. in the First World War. Nurses worked for the notable sum of $4.10 per while in comparison, their male counterparts fighting on the front lines made about $1.10 a day. With a wage pointedly higher wage than the infantrymen, it was evident that Canadian Nursing Sisters held a very important role on the Western front.|$|E
2500|$|The {{complexity}} of Islamic polygyny is also revealed in Assia Djebar's Ombre sultane (Shadow sultana). [...] Written in Algeria in 1987, it is told {{from the perspective}} of the first wife, Isma. [...] She thus constructs through her descriptions how the reader perceives the second wife and the husband. [...] The second wife, Hajila, is seen as a rival and is reduced through Isma's portrayals to body parts that are disassociated from Hajila as a whole person. [...] This reveals Isma's lack of respect for Hajila and the process of [...] "othering" [...] that Isma uses to degrade Hajila. Hence, the idea that polygyny creates a sense of solidarity between wives is shown to be flawed. Isma also describes Hajila in unflattering terms that distance her from the attentions of the husband they share and of other men. This is in contrast to Isma's depiction of herself as constantly being the object of male desire, creating a sense that sisterhood between the two women is out of the question. [...] However, Isma's diction also creates a relationship between herself and Hajila in which neither can exist without the other; [...] "they are locked in a sorority created, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>in</b> tandem with the patriarchal force that remains a threat to their very existence." [...] Therefore, Djebar's portrayal of polygyny is multifaceted and conflicting: it has the ability to create both rivalry and solidarity.|$|E

2500|$|After {{seeing the}} film, The New York Times noted the requiem tone {{captured}} by the film, describing it as [...] "a sleek, muscle car of a movie made in the USA, in that industrial graveyard called Detroit". Manohla Dargis compared Eastwood's presence on film to Dirty Harry and the Man with No Name, stating: [...] "Dirty Harry is back, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>in</b> Gran Torino, not as a character, but as a ghostly presence. He hovers in the film, in its themes and high-caliber imagery, and of course, most obviously, in Mr. Eastwood’s face. It is a monumental face now, so puckered and pleated {{that it no longer}} looks merely weathered, as it has for decades, but seems closer to petrified wood." [...] The Los Angeles Times also praised Eastwood's performance and credibility as an action hero at the age of 78. Kenneth Turan said of Eastwood's performance, [...] "It is a film that is impossible to imagine without the actor in the title role. The notion of a 78-year-old action hero may sound like a contradiction in terms, but Eastwood brings it off, even if his toughness is as much verbal as physical. Even at 78, Eastwood can make [...] "Get off my lawn" [...] sound as menacing as [...] "Make my day", and when he says [...] "I blow a hole in your face and sleep like a baby", he sounds as if he means it". Roger Ebert wrote that the film is [...] "about the belated flowering of a man's better nature. And it's about Americans of different races growing more open to one another in the new century." [...] Sang Chi and Emily Moberg Robinson, editors of Voices of the Asian-American and Pacific Islander Experience: Volume 1, said that within the mainstream media, the film received [...] "criticial acclaim" [...] "for its nuanced portrayal of Asian Americans." [...] Louisa Schein and Va-Megn Thoj, authors of [...] "Gran Torino’s Boys and Men with Guns: Hmong Perspective," [...] said that the mainstream critical response was [...] "centered on Eastwood‘s character and viewed the film mainly as a vision of multicultural inclusion and understanding." ...|$|E
