In that year, the paper {{was purchased}} by Charles Willis Snedden, who proceeded on a course of modernization.

5|$|Np2O5 is black-brown {{in color}} and monoclinic with a lattice size of 418×658×409picometres. It is {{relatively}} unstable and decomposes to NpO2 and O2 at 420-695°C. Although Np2O5 was initially subject to several studies that claimed to produce it with mutually contradictory methods, it was eventually prepared successfully by heating neptunium peroxide to 300-350°C for 2–3 hours or by heating <b>it</b> <b>under</b> <b>a</b> layer of water in an ampoule at 180°C.|$|E

Chuikov, as commander of the Soviet 8th Guards Army, commanded the Soviet forces in central Berlin. Goebbels' letter informed Chuikov of Hitler's death and requested a ceasefire. After this was rejected, Goebbels decided that further efforts were futile.|$|E

This portion was designated a part of Highway420 until 2000, when it was transferred to the City of Niagara Falls and the Regional Municipality of Niagara, although the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) still assists with the maintenance of <b>it</b> <b>under</b> <b>a</b> Connecting Link agreement.|$|E
5|$|Exposure may not {{be evident}} for eight hours for 50% HF, rising to 24 hours for lower concentrations, and a burn may {{initially}} be painless as hydrogen fluoride affects nerve function. If skin has been exposed to HF, damage can be reduced by rinsing <b>it</b> <b>under</b> <b>a</b> jet of water for 10–15 minutes and removing contaminated clothing. Calcium gluconate is often applied next, providing calcium ions to bind with fluoride; skin burns can be treated with 2.5% calcium gluconate gel or special rinsing solutions. Hydrofluoric acid absorption requires further medical treatment; calcium gluconate may be injected or administered intravenously. Using calcium chloride – a common laboratory reagent – in lieu of calcium gluconate is contraindicated, and may lead to severe complications. Excision or amputation of affected parts may be required.|$|E
5|$|Fried {{butter is}} a similar dish, for which recipes exist dating to the 17th century. The first known recipe for fried butter dates to 1615. Fried butter was {{documented}} in the cookbook The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy in 1747. The recipe entailed soaking butter in salted water for a few hours, placing it on a rotisserie ("spit it"), covering it with breadcrumbs and nutmeg, and roasting <b>it</b> <b>under</b> <b>a</b> low fire while continuously covering it with egg yolks and additional bread crumbs. Oysters were recommended to accompany the dish.|$|E

With the orphanage {{on the brink}} of bankruptcy, Kyle defies his mother to go on a quest to search for funds, {{together}} with his best friend Loni. Finding a giant Lens, a mysterious girl named Reala emerges from it, claiming to be in search of a hero. Believing that he should become a hero like his parents, he follows Reala so he can prove himself as such. Finding the Lens missing, officials from the Order of Atamoni arrest Kyle and Lori for its theft. They escape {{with the help of the}} masked swordsman Judas. After this, Kyle becomes embroiled in the attempts by a man named Barbatos Goetia to kill those who accompanied his parents, eventually learning that Barbatos also killed Stahn when Kyle was five. During his quest, a series of Lens thefts is orchestrated by Elrane, the Holy Woman of the Order of Atamoni who is capable of performing miracles using Lens and seeks to bring happiness to the world through uniting <b>it</b> <b>under</b> <b>a</b> single religion.|$|E

Information could be 'down converted' from meaning to symbols, and manipulated symbolically, but moral agency could be undermined if there was inadequate 'up conversion' into meaning.

In 1959, the ward's alderman was displeased by traffic jams near the store, and persuaded City Council to adopt a 1960 report urging the store to build a parking lot.

25|$|Carnegie Hall {{is one of}} {{the last}} large {{buildings}} in New York built entirely of masonry, without a steel frame; however, when several flights of studio spaces were added to the building near the turn of the 20th century, a steel framework was erected around segments of the building. The exterior is rendered in narrow Roman bricks of a mellow ochre hue, with details in terracotta and brownstone. The foyer avoids typical 19th century Baroque theatrical style with the Florentine Renaissance manner of Filippo Brunelleschi's Pazzi Chapel: white plaster and gray stone form a harmonious system of round-headed arched openings and Corinthian pilasters that support an unbroken cornice, with round-headed lunettes above <b>it,</b> <b>under</b> <b>a</b> vaulted ceiling.

He fled the scene as the crowd was in shock and disposed of the pistol by throwing <b>it</b> <b>under</b> <b>a</b> truck, but was grabbed by Vatican security chief Camillo Cibin, a nun, and several spectators who prevented him from firing more shots or escaping, and he was arrested. All four bullets hit John Paul II; two of them lodged in his lower intestine while the other two hit his left index finger and right arm and also injured two bystanders: Ann Odre, of Buffalo, New York, was struck in the chest, and Rose Hall was slightly wounded in the arm. The Pope was immediately rushed to the hospital while the authorities combed the site for evidence. Çelik panicked and fled without setting off his bomb or opening fire.|$|E
