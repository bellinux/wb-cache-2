5|$|In 2009 the IMA {{was awarded}} the National Medal for Museum and Library Service, one of 10 {{institutions}} to receive this annual distinction by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). The IMA was recognized for serving its community {{through a number of}} programs, including Viewfinders, a school program that serves 9,000 local students a year. IMLS also cited the IMA's free admission, greening and sustainability initiatives, <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> virtual audiences, and improvements in accessibility throughout the museum.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the day, Warren's {{squadron}} closed {{from the}} north-east while Bompart made frantic <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> open water. Both fleets were hindered by a gale which swept the sea shortly before 20:00. All three of Hoches topmasts were blown down and her mizzensail shredded, leaving her substantially slower than her compatriots and {{forcing them to}} hold back in her defence. Other ships suffered too, as the French Résolue sprang a severe leak and HMS Anson lost her mizzenmast and several topmasts.|$|E
5|$|Bypassing Vigo on {{his flight}} southwards, Villeneuve {{put into the}} Southern Spanish fleet base of Cadiz on 20 August. By abandoning his <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> the English Channel, Villeneuve was in effect abandoning the entire {{invasion}} strategy and, when news of Villeneuve's retreat reached him, Napoleon decided to formally abandon the campaign, marching the army at Boulogne south to the Austrian border. Without instructions from his superior, and with no idea where the main French fleet was, Allemand spent much of August off the Spanish coast before deciding {{to turn to the}} third aspect of his orders, the disruption of British trade.|$|E

5|$|Captain Renaudin, of Généreux, and Joseph Allemand, of Ville de Marseille, {{were both}} honourably acquitted during the {{automatic}} court-martial {{for the loss}} of their ships. The French Navy made no further <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> Malta, and all subsequent efforts by French warships to break out the port were met by the blockade, only one frigate breaking through and reaching France. Without the supplies carried on Perrée's convoy, starvation and disease spread throughout the garrison {{and by the end of}} August 1800, French soldiers were dying at a rate of 100 a day. On 4 September, Vaubois finally capitulated, turning the island over to the British, who retained it for the next 164 years.|$|E
5|$|Ganteaume's expeditions of 1801 {{were three}} {{connected}} major French Navy {{operations of the}} spring of 1801 during the French Revolutionary Wars. A French naval squadron from Brest under Contre-amiral Honoré Ganteaume, seeking to reinforce the besieged French garrison in Egypt, made three separate but futile <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> the Eastern Mediterranean. The French army in Egypt had been trapped there shortly {{after the start of}} the Napoleonic campaign in Egypt in 1798, when the French Mediterranean Fleet was destroyed at the Battle of the Nile. Since that defeat, the French Navy had maintained only a minimal presence in the Mediterranean Sea, while the more numerous British and their allies had succeeded in blockading and defeating several French bases almost unopposed.|$|E
5|$|The JNA, {{warned about}} {{reinforcements}} to the 137th Infantry Brigade, abandoned {{its plan to}} advance to Barilović. It reoriented its <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> the Korana Bridge {{in the village of}} Malići, down the road from Gornji Velemerić and Carevo Selo (where its tanks were stopped the day before). The battle resumed in the morning when JNA tanks (supported by the Yugoslav Air Force, artillery and multiple rocket launchers) broke through positions held by the 2nd Guards Brigade at 1:00p.m., reaching Carevo Selo before they were stopped again by the HV. Shortly afterwards, the 2nd Battalion of the 7th Brigade arrived from Zagreb to Duga Resa and were attached to the 137th Infantry Brigade. One company of the battalion was deployed to Vinica Hill, and a second was deployed west of Carevo Selo (where it relieved troops from the 2nd Guards Brigade).|$|E

5|$|The episode's story {{focuses on}} married couple Sun (Yunjin Kim) and Jin Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim). In late 2004, on the island, they debate whether to defect to the rival faction of {{survivors}} led by John Locke (Terry O'Quinn). Intercut throughout the episode, {{a series of}} off-island scenes show Sun about to give birth and Jin experiencing a series of difficulties in his <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> {{the hospital with a}} gift of a stuffed panda. The ending shows that Jin's and Sun's scenes do not focus on the same birth; Jin's scenes are flashbacks to events before the plane crash, while Sun's are flashforwards to sometime after she escapes the island. A subplot follows Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) and Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) on board the Kahana, where they learn more about the freighter's mission and find somebody they once knew.|$|E
5|$|While Bonaparte was preoccupied in the Middle East {{and then}} with French politics, the Royal Navy had {{returned}} to the Mediterranean in force. British forces had withdrawn from the region in 1796 after France and Spain became allies in the Treaty of San Ildefonso, but Nelson's victory at the Nile had eliminated the French threat, allowing a large scale redeployment {{in the second half of}} the year. Malta was besieged, the Ionian Islands were captured by a joint Turkish and Russian force and successive <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> the trapped garrison of Egypt were defeated at sea. Negotiations to return the French troops to Europe collapsed and although Kléber defeated an Ottoman attack at the Battle of Heliopolis on 20 March 1800, he was assassinated in June. As morale fell, the situation in Egypt became increasingly desperate for the French garrison and the British planned an invasion for March 1801. News of British intentions reached France where Bonaparte, who had successfully reorganised the French Army and driven back allied advances in Italy thus bringing the continental war to an end, ordered a squadron from the French Atlantic Fleet, based at Brest, to reinforce the garrison in Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Following the Battle of the Java Sea, the Japanese {{were able}} to land a force around Banten Bay and Marek, on the western tip of Java, and {{subsequently}} began advancing east towards Batavia and Buitenzorg, forcing Blackforce to reorientate itself east of the Tjianten River, to make a stand south of Buitenzorg. On 3 March, the battalion went into action around Leuwiliang {{for the first time}} as Dutch troops began to withdraw. Occupying positions in support of the 2/2nd Pioneers who held the bridge over the Tjianten River, they were alerted to the advancing Japanese by the presence of fifth columnists, who were seen to be laying out marking panels. A short time later, a force of five Japanese light tanks attempted to cross the river, but were rebuffed by anti-tank rifles and small arms. The plan had been for the Dutch troops to make a stand at Djasinga, but faulty intelligence resulted in a rout and the Dutch began to withdraw back to Bandung, flooding through Blackforce's lines. In the ensuing chaos, Dutch engineers blew up the bridge at the Tjianten River. For the next couple of days, the battalion fought several skirmishes with 'C' Company bearing the brunt of the Japanese attacks, suffering seven killed and 28 wounded, while inflicting about 200 casualties on the Japanese. As the Allied defence of the island began to collapse, the machine gunners were ordered to hold up the Japanese around Leuwiliang for a day. After this, Blackforce began moving towards Soekaboemi on 5 March, as part of <b>efforts</b> <b>to</b> <b>reach</b> Tjilatjap on the southern coast of the island to secure passage back to Australia. Ultimately, this never eventuated and Blackforce was ordered to surrender on 9 March 1942 following the Dutch capitulation the day before. They would subsequently endure three-and-a-half years in captivity as Japanese prisoners of war, being sent to camps across south-east Asia, including the infamous Thai–Burma Railway. Forced to endure brutal conditions, over worked in labour camps, and inadequately provided for, casualties amongst these men were high.|$|E
