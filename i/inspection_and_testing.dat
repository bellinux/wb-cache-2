5|$|A {{total of}} 162,099 Lexington-Concord Sesquicentennial half dollars were struck at the Philadelphia Mint in April and May, 1925, with 99 pieces {{set aside for}} <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> by the 1926 Assay Commission. The coins were made from blanks, or planchets, that had been {{intended}} for mintage into 1924 Stone Mountain Memorial half dollars, but had not been used.|$|E
5|$|Most {{countries}} require diving cylinders to {{be checked}} on a regular basis. This usually consists of an internal visual inspection and a hydrostatic test. The <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> requirements for scuba cylinders may {{be very different from}} the requirements for other compressed gas containers due to the more corrosive environment.|$|E
5|$|With {{the designs}} accepted, the Mint created working dies {{based on the}} plaster model in July 1925. These were sent from Philadelphia to the San Francisco Mint, where 150,000 coins were struck in August, plus 200 {{reserved}} for <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> at the 1926 meeting of the United States Assay Commission.|$|E
40|$|Abstract-The goal of {{software}} <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>test</b> {{is to reduce}} the expected cost {{of software}} failure over the life of a product. This paper extends the use of defect higgers, the eventsthat cause defects to be discovered, to help evaluate the effectiveness of <b>inspections</b> <b>and</b> <b>test</b> scenarios. In the case of inspections, the defect trigger is defined as a set of values that associate the shills of the inspector with the discovered defect. Similarly, for test scenarios, the defect trigger values embody the deferring strategies being used in creating these scenarios. The usefulness of triggers in evaluating the effectiveness of software <b>inspections</b> <b>and</b> <b>tests</b> is demonstrated by evaluating the <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>test</b> activities of some software products. These evaluations are used to point to both deficiencies in <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>test</b> strategies <b>and</b> to progress made in improving such strategies. The trigger distribution of the entire inspection or test series may then be used to highlight areas for further investigation, with the aim of improving the design, implementation, <b>and</b> <b>test</b> processes.

5|$|The mintage of 15,000 {{was struck}} in July 1936. At the Philadelphia and Denver mints, 5,005 pieces were produced, and 5,006 at San Francisco, with the excess from the even {{thousands}} held for <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> at the 1937 {{meeting of the}} United States Assay Commission. The first 200 pieces from each mint were collected in sets of three, with a notarized letter from Melish testifying to what number coins they were. Several of these special sets were sent by Melish to government officials.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 100,058 Illinois Centennial half dollars were struck at the Philadelphia Mint during August 1918, with the excess over the round number {{reserved}} for <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> at the 1919 {{meeting of the}} annual Assay Commission. There was no official packaging; a few were used in badges for the Illinois Centennial Commission. The coins were not publicized much outside Illinois. The centennial commission distributed them, at face value, to its county affiliates in proportion to their share of Illinois' population, on condition they be sold at a premium {{to help pay for}} local celebrations, and if one had already been held, for war relief.|$|E
5|$|The Philadelphia Mint coined 1,000,528 of {{the half}} dollars {{at the behest of}} the Commission in May and June 1926, with the excess over the {{authorized}} mintage reserved for <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> at the 1927 meeting of the United States Assay Commission. They also had the mint strike 200,226 quarter eagles in May and June, with the excess also set aside for the Assay Commission. The gold piece was the second quarter eagle to be a commemorative, after the Panama–Pacific issue of 1915. No further gold commemoratives, of any denomination, would be issued by the Mint Bureau until 1984, when a $10 piece was issued for the Los Angeles Olympics.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Figural aftereffects were {{measured}} by using square patches of high-contrast grating {{on a dark}} background as <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>test</b> figures. The orientation of the outer square border and the enclosed grating were varied independently in order to evaluate their relative influence {{on the strength of}} the induced change of overall apparent size of the test figure. The largest effect is obtained when <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>test</b> figures are identical in the orientation of both outer border and enclosed grating. The strength of the aftereffect is reduced as a difference in orientation is introduced between <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>test</b> figure for either the outer contour or the contained grating, although the former is a more potent factor than the latter. ...|$|R
5|$|The Philadelphia Mint struck 20,000 gold {{dollars in}} August and October 1916, plus 26 extra {{reserved}} for <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> at the 1917 {{meeting of the}} United States Assay Commission. In February 1917, 10,000 more (plus 14 assay coins) were minted, again at Philadelphia. The Association sold these {{to the public at}} $3 each, the same price at which the Louisiana Purchase pieces, which sold poorly, had been vended. The McKinley Memorial pieces were ill-publicized, and few were sold at full price. Texas coin dealer B. Max Mehl purchased 10,000 pieces at an unknown price, selling them for years afterwards at $2.50 each.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} summer of 1920, a total of 50,028 Maine Centennial half dollars were {{produced}} at the Philadelphia Mint, including 28 pieces reserved for <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> at the 1921 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. No special care was taken in the minting; they were ejected into bins and many display bag marks. They were sent to Maine and placed on sale through the Office of the State Treasurer at a price of $1. Thirty thousand sold immediately and they remained on sale through the treasurer's office until all fifty thousand were vended, though this did not happen until at least 1929. Bowers speculated that had the full 100,000 authorized coins been struck, most of the additional quantity would have been returned to the Mint and melted for lack of buyers. Many pieces were spent {{in the years after}} 1920 and entered circulation.|$|E
5|$|When pressurised, a {{cylinder}} carries an equivalent volume of free gas greater than its water capacity, because the gas is compressed {{up to several}} hundred times atmospheric pressure. The selection of an appropriate set of diving cylinders for a diving operation {{is based on the}} amount of gas required to safely complete the dive. Diving cylinders are most commonly filled with air, but because the main components of air can cause problems when breathed underwater at higher ambient pressure, divers may choose to breathe from cylinders filled with mixtures of gases other than air. Many jurisdictions have regulations that govern the filling, recording of contents, and labelling for diving cylinders. Periodic <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> of cylinders is often obligatory {{to ensure the safety of}} operators of filling stations. Pressurised diving cylinders are considered dangerous goods for commercial transportation, and regional and international standards for colouring and labelling may also apply.|$|E

5|$|McAloney was {{presented}} with his Albert Medal by the acting Governor-General of Australia, William Vanneck, 5th Baron Huntingfield, in a ceremony at Parliament House, Melbourne on 31 May 1938. McAloney recovered sufficiently from his injuries {{to return to his}} duties with the RAAF, and in September was attached to No.1 Aircraft Depot for a period of three months. During this time he was promoted to leading aircraftman, before returning to service with No.1 Squadron. He was formally transferred to No.1 Aircraft Depot from August 1939, and was advanced to corporal on 1 September that year. With the outbreak of the Second World War, McAloney received a rapid series of promotions over the following eighteen months, first to sergeant in April 1940, flight sergeant in March 1941, and finally to warrant officer in February 1942. He was primarily consigned to engine repair and engineering staff work in Australia during the conflict. After making sergeant, he became No.1 Aircraft Depot's non-commissioned officer in charge of overhaul and test work on the Rolls-Royce Kestrel engine. His duties were expanded with his March 1941 promotion to include the overhaul, <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> of both the Kestrel and Rolls-Royce Merlin aircraft engines.|$|E
5|$|The Philadelphia Mint coined 200,112 half {{dollars in}} October 1920, with the excess above the round number {{reserved}} for <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> at the 1921 {{meeting of the}} annual Assay Commission. They were shipped to the National Shawmut Bank of Boston which sold the coins for $1 each to the public, with the profits {{to go to the}} tercentenary commission. The coins could be ordered through any bank in Boston or Plymouth. Swiatek believed the sale of 1920-dated coins to have been very successful, and there was no thought at that time of returning any to the Mint for redemption and melting. The first order had not exhausted the authorized mintage, so the tercentenary commission ordered 100,000 more during the spring of 1921 when sales slowed. These were coined in July, together with 53 pieces held for the 1922 Assay Commission, and they have the year of issue added on the obverse to the left of Bradford. This was done to comply with the Coinage Act of 1873, which required the year of striking to appear on coins. The recession of 1921 began soon after; sales dropped, {{and tens of thousands of}} both dates remained unsold. The tercentenary commission returned 48,000 of the 1920 issue and 80,000 of the 1921 to the Mint.|$|E
5|$|The trains were {{delivered}} late, and {{were put into}} service after the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate had given dispensation from parts of the safety regulation. On 17 June 2000, a train derailed at Nelaug Station after an axle broke. The class was grounded for a month, and the investigation showed both design errors, and lack of proper <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>testing.</b> After they were put back into service, they {{were not allowed to}} use the tilting mechanism—thus not being allowed to run faster than their predecessors. The construction was reinforced, and in 2004, the tilting mechanism was re-enabled along with higher speeds. In 2007, a train derailed on the Bergen Line, and questions were raised about the trains' ability to operate in snow, however the accident report showed that the trains' front axle load was just as able to cope with heavy snow conditions as the locomotives running on the line, and that the derailment would have been more severe if the same conditions would hit a normal train with less secure connections between carriages. On 16 June 2011, two units were destroyed when the train ran into a fire in a snow tunnel at Hallingskeid Station.|$|E

25|$|Initially, only 15,000 of the {{authorized}} {{quantity of}} 25,000 were struck at the Philadelphia Mint, {{as this was}} the quantity the Tercentenary Commission at first ordered. These were struck not later than April 10, 1935, and were sent at the commission's request to the Hartford National Bank and Trust Company, distributing agent for the coin. Placed on sale on April 21, they were rapidly exhausted, and on April 25, Fisher ordered the remaining 10,000. The commission had enquired as {{to the possibility of}} having the coins struck at different mints and in proof condition, but was told that the heavy volume of work at the Mint forbade having those done. The price per coin was $1. In addition to the coins sent to Hartford, the Mint struck 18 pieces, reserved for <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> at the 1936 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. The United States Post Office Department issued a three-cent stamp for the anniversary on April 26, 1935, also depicting the Charter Oak.|$|E
40|$|It is {{controversial}} whether {{the magnitude of}} the motion aftereffect is greater when both <b>inspection</b> <b>and</b> <b>test</b> stimuli are the same color rather than different colors (color selectivity}.
