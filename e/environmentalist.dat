40|$|In this partial {{equilibrium}} and static model, {{the impact}} of environmentalism on two countries' environmental policies is presented. First, the only (indirect) way <b>environmentalists</b> influence the choice of pollution taxes is through a negative term in the welfare function in Home. It is defined as passive environmentalism (PE). Second, this article is a first attempt to consider domestic <b>environmentalists</b> lobbying a foreign government. It is defined as active environmentalism (AE). Our contribution is threefold. We emphasize first that the way <b>environmentalists</b> act is paramount to study {{the consequences of their}} actions. Passive or active environmentalisms have very different impacts on environmental policies. Second, we show that lobbying activities can be counter-productive for <b>environmentalists.</b> Third, we characterize cases in which the presence of <b>environmentalists</b> has a non-ambiguous positive impact on welfare.

25|$|Attempts {{to reach}} {{political}} agreement on effective policies for climate change continue, and pro-nuclear <b>environmentalists</b> seek {{to reverse the}} traditionally anti-nuclear attitudes of <b>environmentalists.</b> Filmmaker Rob Stone's Pandora's Promise (2013) {{is a good example}} of this trend.|$|R
5000|$|Anti-environmentalism refers to the {{way that}} {{corporations}} and conservative groups in society have sought to counter the gains made by <b>environmentalists,</b> to redirect and diminish public concern about the environment, to attack <b>environmentalists,</b> and to persuade politicians against increased environmental regulation. [...] <b>Environmentalists</b> argue that the only solutions to climate change will come from humans interfering less with the Earth, or to stop interfering altogether. In {{the eyes of many}} anti-environmentalists, environmentalism is radical and “anti-human".|$|R
5000|$|Though many <b>{{environmental}}ists</b> blame {{markets for}} many of today's environmental problems, free-market <b>environmentalists</b> blame many of these problems on distortions {{of the market and}} the lack of markets.

40|$|As {{environmental}} issues and the communities that confront them increasingly transcend borders, <b>environmentalists</b> in the North (wealthier countries) and the South (poorer countries) face the challenges of effective communication and collaboration. Acknowledging differences in how <b>environmentalists</b> culturally construct the environment is an important starting point; particularly given the tendency {{on the part of}} Northern <b>environmentalists</b> to assume (a) that environmentalism is essentially the same in different cultures i. e., it is all like Northern environmentalism; and (b) that environmentalism is more developed in the North. This study examines and compares the constructed environments of a sample of Mexican and Canadian <b>environmentalists.</b> Some significant differences are identified. The <b>environmentalists</b> in the two countries constructed the environment differently {{as a result of their}} distinct histories, economies and use of technology. Cultural constructions of the physical environment overlap with and cannot be separated from constructions of the social, cultural, political and economic environment...|$|R

5000|$|Specific {{performance}} standards: <b>Environmentalists</b> {{urged the}} EPA {{to phase out}} the use of lagoons (holding animal waste in pond-like structures) and sprayfields (spraying waste onto crops). <b>Environmentalists</b> argued that these techniques for dealing with animal waste were outmoded and present an [...] "unacceptable risk to {{public health and the}} environment" [...] due to their ability to pollute both surface and groundwater following [...] "weather events, human error, and system failures." [...] <b>Environmentalists</b> suggested that whenever manure is land applied that it should be injected into the soil (and not sprayed).|$|R
