5|$|Photons are emitted in many natural processes. For example, when {{a charge}} is {{accelerated}} it emits synchrotron radiation. During a molecular, atomic or nuclear {{transition to a}} lower energy level, photons of various <b>energy</b> <b>will</b> be emitted, ranging from radio waves to gamma rays. Photons can also be emitted when a particle and its corresponding antiparticle are annihilated (for example, electron–positron annihilation).|$|E
5|$|Precise modern {{models of}} the Big Bang appeal to various exotic {{physical}} phenomena {{that have not been}} observed in terrestrial laboratory experiments or incorporated into the Standard Model of particle physics. Of these features, dark matter is currently subjected to the most active laboratory investigations. Remaining issues include the cuspy halo problem and the dwarf galaxy problem of cold dark matter. Dark energy is also an area of intense interest for scientists, {{but it is not clear}} whether direct detection of dark <b>energy</b> <b>will</b> be possible. Inflation and baryogenesis remain more speculative features of current Big Bang models. Viable, quantitative explanations for such phenomena are still being sought. These are currently unsolved problems in physics.|$|E

5|$|New {{government}} spending, regulation, {{and policies}} helped the industry weather the 2009 economic crisis better {{than many other}} sectors. Most notably, U.S. President Barack Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included more than $70billion in direct spending and tax credits for clean energy and associated transportation programs. This policy-stimulus combination represents the largest federal commitment in U.S. history for renewables, advanced transportation, and energy conservation initiatives. Based on these new rules, many more utilities strengthened their clean-energy programs. Clean Edge suggests that the commercialization of clean <b>energy</b> <b>will</b> help {{countries around the world}} deal with the current economic malaise. Once-promising solar energy company, Solyndra, became involved in a political controversy involving U.S. President Barack Obama's administration's authorization of a $535million loan guarantee to the Corporation in 2009 as part of a program to promote alternative energy growth. The company ceased all business activity, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and laid-off nearly all of its employees in early September 2011.|$|E

25|$|This {{means that}} for a system which is not in equilbrium, its Gibbs <b>energy</b> <b>will</b> always be decreasing, {{and when it is}} in {{equilibrium}} (i.e. no longer changing), the infinitesimal change dG will be zero.

25|$|A {{commonly}} cited counter-example where {{energy is}} not shared among its various forms and where equipartition {{does not hold}} in the microcanonical ensemble is a system of coupled harmonic oscillators. If the system is isolated {{from the rest of}} the world, the energy in each normal mode is constant; energy is not transferred from one mode to another. Hence, equipartition does not hold for such a system; the amount of energy in each normal mode is fixed at its initial value. If sufficiently strong nonlinear terms are present in the energy function, energy may be transferred between the normal modes, leading to ergodicity and rendering the law of equipartition valid. However, the Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem states that <b>energy</b> <b>will</b> not be exchanged unless the nonlinear perturbations are strong enough; if they are too small, the <b>energy</b> <b>will</b> remain trapped in at least some of the modes.|$|E
25|$|The 122PW of {{sunlight}} reaching the Earth's surface is plentiful—almost 10,000 {{times more than}} the 13TW equivalent of average power consumed in 2005 by humans.

The paper sets up a LEAP model and designs three scenarios of economic growth of China, and simulates China's electrification level by 2030. The results show that China's electrification level has a larger increase potential in the mid-long term and rapid change of economic development pattern can help to increase the electrification level.

25|$|The use of {{microwave}} {{transmission of}} {{power has been}} the most controversial issue in considering any SPS design. At the Earth's surface, a suggested microwave beam would have a maximum intensity at its center, of 23mW/cm2 (less than 1/4 the solar irradiation constant), and an intensity of less than 1mW/cm2 outside the rectenna fenceline (the receiver's perimeter). These compare with current United States Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) workplace exposure limits for microwaves, which are 10mW/cm2, - the limit itself being expressed in voluntary terms and ruled unenforceable for Federal OSHA enforcement purposes. A beam of this intensity is therefore at its center, of a similar magnitude to current safe workplace levels, even for long term or indefinite exposure. Outside the receiver, it is far less than the OSHA long-term levels Over 95% of the beam <b>energy</b> <b>will</b> fall on the rectenna. The remaining microwave <b>energy</b> <b>will</b> be absorbed and dispersed well within standards currently imposed upon microwave emissions around the world. It is important for system efficiency that as much of the microwave radiation as possible be focused on the rectenna. Outside the rectenna, microwave intensities rapidly decrease, so nearby towns or other human activity should be completely unaffected.|$|E
25|$|Any {{principle}} of relativity prescribes a symmetry in natural law: that is, the laws must {{look the same}} to one observer as they do to another. According to a theoretical result called Noether's theorem, any such symmetry will also imply a conservation law alongside. For example, if two observers at different times see the same laws, then a quantity called <b>energy</b> <b>will</b> be conserved. In this light, relativity principles make testable predictions about how nature behaves, and are not just statements about how scientists should write laws.|$|E

50|$|Tetrahedral {{complexes}} are {{the second}} most common type; here four ligands form a tetrahedron around the metal ion. In a tetrahedral crystal field splitting, the d-orbitals again split into two groups, with an energy difference of Δtet. The lower <b>energy</b> orbitals <b>will</b> be dz2 and dx2-y2, and the higher <b>energy</b> orbitals <b>will</b> be dxy, dxz and dyz - opposite to the octahedral case. Furthermore, since the ligand electrons in tetrahedral symmetry are not oriented directly towards the d-orbitals, the <b>energy</b> splitting <b>will</b> be lower than in the octahedral case. Square planar and other complex geometries can also be described by CFT.|$|R

25|$|Grid parity (or socket parity) {{occurs when}} an {{alternative}} energy source can generate electricity at a levelized cost (LCoE) that is {{less than or equal}} to the price of purchasing power from the electricity grid. Reaching grid parity is considered to be the point at which an energy source becomes a contender for widespread development without subsidies or government support. It is widely believed that a wholesale shift in generation to these forms of <b>energy</b> <b>will</b> take place when they reach grid parity.|$|E
25|$|Often {{done with}} gases, {{but also with}} liquids, the {{diffusion}} method relies {{on the fact that}} in thermal equilibrium, two isotopes with the same <b>energy</b> <b>will</b> have different average velocities. The lighter atoms (or the molecules containing them) will travel more quickly and be more likely to diffuse through a membrane. The difference in speeds is proportional to the square root of the mass ratio, so the amount of separation is small and many cascaded stages are needed to obtain high purity. This method is expensive due to the work needed to push gas through a membrane and the many stages necessary.|$|E
25|$|After a cloud, for instance, {{has started}} {{its way to}} {{becoming}} a lightning generator, atmospheric water vapor acts as a substance (or insulator) that decreases the ability of the cloud to discharge its electrical energy.

This <b>energy</b> <b>will</b> be released to a locally, oppositely charged region in the form of lightning.
