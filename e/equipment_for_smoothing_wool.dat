30|$|Accessibility is a {{critical}} issue in site planning. A good accessibility plan can avoid possible conflicts involving <b>equipment</b> and allows <b>for</b> <b>smooth</b> transportation during the entire project. It can also ensure that sufficient space is available so that all onsite equipment, such as trucks, cranes and excavators can be safely operated. In current practice, the evaluation of accessibility is done manually, relying heavily {{on the experience of}} the construction planners. However, the evaluation needs to deal with temporal and spatial information simultaneously, which make the manual evaluations very challenging.|$|R
40|$|At {{this work}} the {{assessment}} of state of water drainage conditions {{and the needs of}} its maintenance was carried out, as the basis for rational water management in usage of agricultural of Zagorow polder area. Based on field research, {{it was found that the}} condition of the 80. 8 % of the length of canals and ditches, and 40. 7 % of hydraulic and communication structures is unacceptable and does not meet the accepted criteria. The main reason of such condition of drainage facilities is a long-term exploitation absence or insufficient maintenance work frequency. To restore the proper state of maintenance facilities, in most cases the routine operation is sufficient. Before to the work we should conduct a detailed analysis regarding the necessity of the <b>equipment</b> <b>for</b> the <b>smooth</b> functioning of the drainage system. The analysis should address the current needs of the drainage area taking into account the economic conditions and the needs of environmental protection. On the polders often characterized by large natural values it is recommended to apply the principles of reasonable compromise between maintaining adequate drainage facilities and state of conservation of the natural environment...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} batch control of {{granular}} materials in production of building materials from fluorine anhydrite. Batching <b>equipment</b> is intended <b>for</b> <b>smooth</b> operation and timely feeding of supply hoppers at a required level. Level sensors and a controller of an asynchronous screw drive motor {{are used to}} control filling of the hopper with industrial anhydrite binders. The controller generates a required frequency and ensures required productivity of a feed conveyor. Mamdani-type fuzzy inference is proposed for controlling {{the speed of the}} screw that feeds mixture components. As related to production of building materials based on fluoride anhydrite, this method is used for the first time. A fuzzy controller is proven to be effective in controlling the filling level of the supply hopper. In addition, the authors determined optimal parameters of the batching process to ensure smooth operation and production of fluorine anhydrite materials of specified properties that can compete with gypsum-based products...|$|R
50|$|Barathea, {{sometimes}} spelled barrathea, is a soft fabric, with a {{hopsack twill}} weave giving a surface that is lightly pebbled or ribbed. The yarns use cover various combinations of wool, silk and cotton. Worsted barathea (made with a <b>smooth</b> <b>wool</b> yarn) {{is often used}} for evening coats, such as dress coats, dinner jackets, and military uniforms, in black and midnight blue. Silk barathea, either all silk, or using cotton weft and silken warp, is widely used in the necktie industry.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{prove that the}} E^†_K-valued cohomology, {{introduced}} in [9] is finite dimensional <b>for</b> <b>smooth</b> curves over Laurent series fields k((t)) in positive characteristic, and forms an E^†_K-lattice inside `classical' E_K-valued rigid cohomology. We do so by proving a suitable version of the p-adic local monodromy theory over E^†_K, and then using an étale pushforward <b>for</b> <b>smooth</b> curves to reduce {{to the case of}} A^ 1. We then introduce E^†_K-valued cohomology with compact supports, and again prove that <b>for</b> <b>smooth</b> curves, this is finite dimensional and forms an E^†_K-lattice in E_K-valued cohomology with compact supports. Finally, we prove Poincaré duality <b>for</b> <b>smooth</b> curves, but with restrictions on the coefficients. Comment: 40 pages, comments very welcome...|$|R
