40|$|Secrecy profoundly {{challenges}} democratic oversight. Law enforcement cooperation, however, {{requires some}} space for discretion and confidentiality. This classical paradox {{within the context}} of the European Union is central in the current legislative debate on Europol’s revision. The reform is initiated by the Commission’s proposal in March 2013 and, for the first time in its history, the European Parliament has direct power to decide over the future of the intelligence agency. This article argues that we should not overestimate European Parliament’s post-Lisbon prerogative for oversight, and particularly its access to <b>Europol</b> <b>Classified</b> <b>Information,</b> due to the architecture of intelligence exchange. The foundational principle of intelligence cooperation confers absolute discretion to the originators of information and Europol’s "secrets" in almost all cases originate from the member states or third parties. The article offers a new legal and empirical perspective on the tensions of secrecy and oversight in the EU, and especially in the Area of Freedom Security and Justice. It discusses the internal information structure of Europol and suggests options for more plausible oversight arrangements...|$|E

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Department of Energy (DOE) maintains millions of classified documents containing highly sensitive nuclear weapons design and production information. Allegations that the Peoples Republic of China obtained nuclear warhead designs from an employee of DOE's Los Alamos National Laboratory, {{as well as the}} disappearance of two computer hard drives containing highly sensitive weapons information from that same laboratory, have raised concerns about how effectively DOE protects <b>classified</b> <b>information,</b> particularly the most sensitive <b>classified</b> <b>information</b> that is contained in vaults and computer systems. DOE's security program consists of many strategies for protecting and controlling <b>classified</b> <b>information,</b> such as controlling access to <b>classified</b> <b>information</b> through physical and administrative barriers and determining whether a person's work requires a "need to know" the information. DOE has recently increased protection for top-secret documents by revising its Classified Matter Protection and Control Manual, which provides detailed requirements for the protection and control of classified matter. This report reviews the (1) extent to which DOE's Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories have implemented DOE's established access controls and need-to-know requirements for classified vaults and computer systems containing the most sensitive <b>classified</b> <b>information</b> as well as the adequacy of these requirements and (2) steps DOE is taking to upgrade the protection of its <b>classified</b> <b>information.</b> GAO found that the Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories have implemented DOE's access controls and need-to-know requirements for both vaults and classified computer systems containing the most sensitive <b>classified</b> <b>information.</b> However, DOE's requirements for documenting need to know lack specificity, allowing laboratory managers wide variations in interpretation and implementation and. DOE has recently taken, and continues to take, steps to upgrade protection and control over its <b>classified</b> <b>information,</b> but additional steps are needed. ...|$|R

5000|$|The United States {{does not}} have British-style Official Secrets Act; instead, several laws protect <b>classified</b> <b>information,</b> {{including}} the Espionage Act of 1917, the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 and the Intelligence Identities Protection Act of 1982. A 2013 report to Congress noted that [...] "... criminal statutes that may apply to the publication of <b>classified</b> defense <b>information</b> ... have been used almost exclusively to prosecute individuals with access to <b>classified</b> <b>information</b> (and a corresponding obligation to protect it), who make it available to foreign agents, or to foreign agents who obtain <b>classified</b> <b>information</b> unlawfully while present in the United States.

[...] The legislative and executive branches of government, including US presidents, have frequently leaked <b>classified</b> <b>information</b> to journalists. Congress has repeatedly resisted or failed to pass a law that generally outlaws disclosing <b>classified</b> <b>information.</b> Most espionage law only criminalizes national defense information; only a jury can decide if a given document meets that criterion, and judges have repeatedly said that being [...] "classified" [...] does not necessarily make information become related to the [...] "national defense". Furthermore, by law, information may not be classified merely because it would be embarrassing or to cover illegal activity; information may only be classified to protect national security objectives.|$|R
