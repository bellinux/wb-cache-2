5000|$|An {{intermediate}} form of point-to-point construction uses {{terminal strips}} (sometimes called [...] "tag boards") or turret boards. The crucial invention was to apply soldering to <b>electrical</b> <b>assembly.</b> In soldering, an alloy of tin and lead, or later bismuth and tin, is melted and adheres to other, nonmolten metals, such as copper or tinned steel. Solder makes a strong electrical and mechanical connection. Note that if components are arranged on boards with tags or turrets {{at both ends}} and wires going to the next components, then the construction is correctly called tag or turret construction respectively, as the components are not going from point to point.|$|E

However, thermoelectric energy conversion systems that use thermoelectric materials (e.g. SiGe alloys) as a supplemental {{source of power}} for missions near the sun can operate unprotected in vacuum and air environments under high temperatures due to their low sensitivity to radiation damage. Such properties have made SiGe thermoelectrics convenient for power generation in space.The multifoil cold stack assembly, composed of molybdenum, tungsten, stainless steel, copper, and alumina materials, provides the insulation between the electrical and thermal currents of the system. The SiGe n-leg doped with boron and SiGe p-leg doped with phosphorus act as the intermediary between the heat source and <b>electrical</b> <b>assembly.</b>|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} of this survey is to quantify the free convective heat transfer that occurs in hemispherical air-filled cavities. The disk constitutes an active <b>electrical</b> <b>assembly</b> designed to control systems used in various engineering applications as in solar energy and domotics. In safety and security fields, hemispherical cavities are widely used to control recording, warning and emergency systems.

It is inclined at an angle varying between 90 ° (vertical position) and 180 ° (disk horizontal with dome oriented downwards). The numerical approach is performed {{by means of the}} finite volume method for Rayleigh numbers in the range 104 – 5 × 108.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel automated manufacturing process for mass producing nano devices with superior and advanced material, Carbon nanotubes (CNTs). CNTs {{are found to}} be a promising material for nanoelectronics due to their sizes and unique properties. Conventional electronic devices replaced by CNT are possibly to be miniature and provide better performance, and therefore, people have focused on developing a method to produce CNT based nano devices. <b>Electrical</b> <b>assembly</b> of CNTs is one of the promising methods to manipulate the CNT in place and apply them in such applications. Since the size of CNTs is in nano scale, traditional robotic manipulation cannot be applied. Building single CNT device is challenging and therefore, most people have concentrated on manipulating bundled CNTs. However, the electrical property of bundled CNTs is difficult to control, and resulting the device cannot benefit from quantum properties of single CNT. Therefore, an automated process for manufacturing single CNT based nano devices is developed. A CNT deposition system is developed to manipulate single CNT across microelectrodes precisely and repeatedly by dielectrophoresis (DEP). Moreover, different types of CNTs can be selected by using a micro chamber to filter specific electronic property of CNTs. The system can potentially be used to fabricate an array of CNT based devices, and a fast and feasible batch nano assembly of consistent nano devices can be achieved. © 2007 IEEE.

Augmented Reality has started spreading among people with applications of games, sports, tourist places, shopping and even in viewing things which appear invisible in walls. There are number of electrical cables, water pipes, vents passing over, behind a wall. Sometimes when you need to set up new electrical cables or new water pipes connection inside your wall one needs to figure out the existing circuitry of cables and structure of water pipes before piercing a hole. At some places there are large bunch of electrical cables running over while in some places there are number of water pipes there is no such standard for infrastructure of a building. It depends on area and usage number of things that are structure inside wall. One such example is complicated wire mesh in Boeing aircraft. The <b>electrical</b> <b>assembly</b> of aircraft is highly complex which thousands of cables running through it. Using the augmented reality technique, we can view the infrastructure inside wall for that particular wire which is in reality invisible as it hides behind the wall. This thesis shows how to integrate 3 -D virtual objects into a 3 -D real environment in real time. It describes the visualization and planning at different places in a home or offices or any places you may visit. We use Qualcomm's Augmented Reality SDK (QCAR) for a mobile device. In this method, we show that a number of 3 D virtual walls with a certain scale are stored as an Image Target in an application. The 3 D view shows wires, pipes, vents and other infrastructures inside the wall. Thus, we provide a very effective and intuitive way of "annotating" reality...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Uncertainty remains about {{urinary bladder}} cancer (UBC) risk for many occupations. Here, we {{investigate}} {{the association between}} occupation, industry and UBC. Methods Lifetime occupational history was collected by in-person interview for 604 newly diagnosed UBC patients and 604 cancer-free controls. Each job title was assigned a two-digit industry code and a three-digit occupation code. Odds ratios (ORs) for UBC associated with ever being employed in an industry or occupation were calculated by unconditional logistic regression adjusting for age, gender and smoking status. We also examined UBC risk by duration of employment (> 0 to Results Significantly increased risk of UBC was observed among waiters and bartenders (OR 2. 87; 95 % CI 1. 05 to 7. 72) and occupations related to medicine and health (OR 2. 17; 95 % CI 1. 21 to 3. 92), agricultural production, livestock and animal specialties (OR 1. 90; 95 % CI 1. 03 to 3. 49), <b>electrical</b> <b>assembly,</b> installation and repair (OR 1. 69; 95 % CI 1. 07 to 2. 65), communications (OR 1. 74; 95 % CI 1. 00 to 3. 01), and health services (OR 1. 58; 95 % CI 1. 02 to 2. 44). For these occupations we also observed a significant excess risk of UBC for long-term work (i. e. ≥ 10 years), {{with the exception of}} waiters and bartenders. Employment for 10 years or more was associated with increased risk of UBC in general farmers (OR 9. 58; 95 % CI 2. 18 to 42. 05), agricultural production of crops (OR 3. 36; 95 % CI 1. 10 to 10. 27), occupations related to bench working (OR 4. 76; 95 % CI 1. 74 to 13. 01), agricultural, fishery, forestry & related (OR 4. 58; 95 % CI 1. 97 to 10. 65), transportation equipment (OR 2. 68; 95 % CI 1. 03 to 6. 97), and structural work (OR 1. 85; 95 % CI 1. 16 to 2. 95). Conclusions This study provides evidence of increased risk of UBC for occupations that were previously reported as at-risk. Workers in several occupation and industry groups have a significantly higher risk of UBC, particularly when duration of employment is 10 years or more. </p...|$|E
