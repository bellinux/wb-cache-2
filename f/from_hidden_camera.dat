50|$|What {{separates}} Scare Tactics <b>from</b> other <b>hidden</b> <b>camera</b> {{shows is}} the cinematic shooting and editing style that gives each piece {{the look and}} feel of a scary movie. In the end, hopefully the audience delights in being “in on the joke”, first laughing AT our victims, then WITH them as the prank is revealed.|$|R

5000|$|Set in Las Vegas, {{the series}} stars rapper Sir Mix-a-Lot as [...] "The Watcher", an omniscient narrator who watches the {{activities}} of others all throughout the city of Las Vegas via all the monitors in his hotel suite which are filming live <b>from</b> the <b>hidden</b> <b>cameras</b> all throughout the city. The Watcher also starred Bobbie Phillips as Lori Danforth, a limo driver.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} each episode, {{with the}} {{exception}} of episode 9 and 10, 4 recurring gags are shown; the first gag shows an exhausted Izumi either in bed or bathing. The second gag shows Mitsuki working on her photobook of Izumi's revealing pictures taken <b>from</b> <b>hidden</b> <b>cameras</b> earlier on in the episode. The third gag shows a frustrated Yoshitaka in a small, messy room working on draft designs for new outfits for his maids. The fourth gag shows an aerial shot of the mansion with Yoshitaka ranting or manically laughing, and two numbers show up. The first number is the amount of damages Izumi must pay off for that particular day, and the second number is the amount of money she has left to pay, listed in yen. And, in some of the episodes it shows Mitsuki's earnings for that day.|$|R
5000|$|Nine strangers {{have been}} {{abducted}} and locked inside a house. A mysterious voice called The Watcher (voiced by Jim Carter) tells {{them that they}} are to play a game: the last person alive can leave the house and win five million dollars. The film is presented with [...] "live feeds" [...] <b>from</b> <b>hidden</b> surveillance <b>cameras,</b> showing the nine people turning from cooperative escape attempts to a killing fest.|$|R
5000|$|On December 4, 2009, {{the polar}} bear, Aisaqvak {{gave birth to}} two cubs. This {{was the first time}} a Canadian zoo {{experienced}} the birth of twin polar bears. [...] The polar bear cubs at first were only viewed <b>from</b> a <b>hidden</b> <b>camera</b> inside the den and eventually at three months of age wandered outside with their mom away from public viewing. When the cubs were six months old, they made their first public appearance at the Wild Zoo in June 2010.|$|R
25|$|In 1995 Lauro, doorman {{at a small}} Upper East Side {{apartment}} building, {{was arrested}} on burglary charges after a resident sent video <b>from</b> a <b>hidden</b> <b>camera</b> to police that apparently showed Lauro stealing from his apartment while on vacation. After his arrest the detectives were told he should be taken on a perp walk for cameras from a local TV station, to which the tenant had licensed his surveillance video. He was taken, in handcuffs, out to a police car, driven around the block and {{walked back into the}} building.|$|R
5000|$|The series uses a <b>hidden</b> <b>camera</b> format, playing {{harmless}} {{but very}} amusing pranks on unsuspecting subjects while <b>hidden</b> <b>cameras</b> capture their responses. Each episode presents {{an average of}} about 10 pranks. What sets this program apart <b>from</b> other <b>hidden</b> <b>camera</b> shows, however, is that it has an erotic element infused into each gag. Thus the name, [...] "Naked and Funny" [...] as well as the series’ logline: [...] "The <b>hidden</b> <b>camera</b> series with an erotic twist." [...] For example, a waitress in a restaurant comes to take an unsuspecting client's order and comes back with his food wearing nothing but lingerie. In the same show, an unsuspecting young lady is pulled over by a cop who gets out of his car and starts stripping for her. All segments are filmed without any dialogue; the audio has sound effects, a laugh track, and music specially composed by Edward Tsyselsky and Sergei Shustov for the series’ producer, AFL Productions. All gags are filmed in Odessa, Ukraine.|$|R
50|$|PJ {{is upset}} that Danielle {{brokered}} a deal outside of court, but Rex reminds him {{they are still}} {{the public face of}} the company and they cannot have a public falling out. The detectives confront Rex about his alibi, suggesting that he was with Hildy that night, which Rex denies. Rex shows them a picture <b>from</b> a <b>hidden</b> <b>camera</b> in the office, and they notice a blue knit cap covered the lens. During questioning, Hildy admits she and PJ turned off the <b>cameras</b> to <b>hide</b> an affair. Parker used the affair to blackmailed her into allowing him access to the office.|$|R
50|$|Roy Happy: The {{owner of}} the {{amusement}} park, whose face is always <b>hidden</b> <b>from</b> the <b>camera.</b> He keeps a white cat in his lap and does several {{other things that are}} direct homages to Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the nemesis of James Bond.|$|R
50|$|Ian cannot find Alice, so {{he returns}} to the garage and disarms Nica, believing her to be {{responsible}} for the murders. Nica tries to explain that Chucky is alive, but Chucky acts like a lifeless doll when Ian looks at him. Ian decides to review the footage <b>from</b> a <b>hidden</b> <b>camera</b> that he planted on Chucky earlier (to get evidence of Barb's affair with Jill) and learns that Alice is locked in a closet and that Chucky truly is alive. Exposed, Chucky murders Ian with a hatchet before he can act. Nica manages to break out of her restraints and tries to kill Chucky, but she fails and Chucky pushes her over the balcony onto the ground floor.|$|R

In contrast, “ray 3 ” cannot be observed because it reaches the surface that is <b>hidden</b> <b>from</b> the <b>camera.</b> Therefore, it is necessary to find the optimal setup of measurement to minimize the number of unobservable paths.|$|R
50|$|The film, {{just over}} a minute long, is {{composed}} of two shots. In the first, a girl sits {{at the base of}} an altar or tomb, her face <b>hidden</b> <b>from</b> the <b>camera.</b> At the center of the altar, a viewing portal displays the portraits of three U.S. Presidents—Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, and William McKinley—each victims of assassination.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} rituals of outspokenness, by analysing cases drawn <b>from</b> the US <b>hidden</b> <b>camera</b> show, Primetime: What Would You Do? Studying ritualistic behaviour {{in cases when}} bystanders become side participants as they stand up for victims of abuse fills a knowledge gap in pragmatics. A further merit of studying this phenomenon is that it provides insight into the reactive aspect of ritual behaviour, which is usually described in the field {{as a form of}} action rather than reaction. Furthermore, examining the morally loaded acts of rituals of outspokenness reveals the potentially complex relationship between aggression and normative behaviour...|$|R
500|$|The four actors locate Four Leaf, Cody, and Tugg {{and cross}} a bridge rigged to explode {{to get to}} Underwood's helicopter. Tugg {{initially}} remains behind, believing Flaming Dragon to be his [...] "family", but runs back screaming, chased by an angry horde. Four Leaf destroys the bridge, rescuing Tugg, but as the helicopter takes off, the gang boss fires a rocket-propelled grenade at the helicopter. Rick unexpectedly stumbles out of the jungle carrying a TiVo box and throws it {{in the path of}} the grenade, saving them. The crew return to Hollywood, where footage <b>from</b> the <b>hidden</b> <b>cameras</b> is compiled into a feature film, Tropic Blunder, which becomes a major critical and commercial success. The film wins Tugg his first Academy Award, which Kirk presents to him at the ceremony. During the end credits, Grossman dances alone to Ludacris' [...] "Get Back".|$|R

40|$|Who are {{you looking}} at?' was {{developed}} in collaboration with Mike Pearson and Welsh playwright Ed Thomas, and presented {{under the umbrella of}} Brookes and Pearson's performance collective 'Pearson/Brookes'. Realised over three nights in February 2004, and built on material produced in collaboration with five young female performers - each documenting 3 mins within a particular public city centre location, on the same evening - producing footage of each location from three simultaneous and expanding points of view: [1] <b>from</b> a <b>hidden</b> <b>camera</b> on the performer themselves; [2] from a shadowing camera recording their movements; and [3] a wider locating shot taken from within a tracking car. Performed by Brookes, Pearson and Thomas - working around a large central table, arranged with all the necessary equipment and material - the resulting video fragments being layered with live texts and vocal recordings of the performers in conversation, mixed live within the room of the developing public event. Documentation and original media fragments of the work are available...|$|R
50|$|Roach {{released}} his films through Pathé Exchange until 1927, {{when he went}} to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He converted his silent movie studio to sound in late 1928 and began releasing talking shorts in early 1929. In the days before dubbing, foreign language versions of the Roach comedies were created by reshooting each film in the Spanish, French, and sometimes Italian and German languages. Laurel & Hardy, Charley Chase, and the Our Gang kids (some of whom had barely begun school) were required to recite the foreign dialogue phonetically, often working <b>from</b> blackboards <b>hidden</b> off <b>camera.</b>|$|R
50|$|After the iPPV {{went off}} the air, Cole was chased {{out of the ring}} by Hiroshi Tanahashi and Jushin Thunder Liger. Tanahashi then grabbed a microphone, thanked the crowd and promised New Japan would be back. Meanwhile, on the iPPV broadcast, ROH {{presented}} a pre-taped vignette, where Christopher Daniels announced that he and another unnamed individual, whose face was <b>hidden</b> <b>from</b> the <b>camera,</b> were coming back to ROH at Best in the World 2014 on June 22.|$|R

He became known as a [...] "preacher without face" [...] (Prediger ohne Gesicht), because in many of his videos, his face would be <b>hidden</b> <b>from</b> the <b>camera.</b>|$|R
50|$|By February 2005, {{the police}} hadn't made much more {{progress}} in the case, {{so they decided to}} launch an elaborate undercover operation which would end up costing over CAD $400,000. It began with Hart being approached in a parking lot by an undercover agent, and eventually being asked to run a delivery for what he was told was an organized crime group. Over a period of four months, the agents would continue the operation and get closer to Hart, and led him to believe that he was becoming more accepted in the organization. After four months, the supposed leader of the group asked Hart a question he was told would test his loyalty. It was at this time he was asked about the murder of his daughters, and with some detail described the scenario, eventually taking some of the agents {{to the scene of the}} crime. The jury at the trial was able to watch the confession taped <b>from</b> a <b>hidden</b> <b>camera</b> in the hotel where Hart described the murder.|$|R
5000|$|On 22 May 2013, amateur-looking videos {{appeared}} on YouTube showing Stromae, apparently drunk and wandering at the Louiza tram station in Brussels at dawn. The videos went viral. A few days later, {{it was revealed}} that this was linked with the filming of a professional music video. This was confirmed during an appearance by Stromae on the French TV show Ce soir ou jamais in which he discussed and also performed his new single [...] "Formidable", which is about the story of a drunk man just separated from his girlfriend. The clip was made <b>from</b> edited <b>hidden</b> <b>camera</b> footage taken on 22 May. It also shows people taking pictures with their cellphones, people who are clearly irritated by his drunk actions, people helping him stand up, and three policemen asking if the artist is okay or if he needs some help. The policemen also got some critiques for not acting against the drunk Stromae; however, they later declared that the entire story was not shown. The part where they returned and Stromae had to explain his case was not broadcast.|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{internal}} states of others {{is essential in}} social exchanges. The aim of the presented thesis {{is to provide a}} deeper understanding of the impact nonverbal cues have on the perception of internal states, namely of emotions and associated cognitive appraisals. First, we explored naturalistic behaviour <b>from</b> a <b>hidden</b> <b>camera,</b> described with technical coding systems, FACS for perceived facial muscle movements and a coding scheme defined by ourselves for the hand, arm and torso movements. Participants were asked to judge observed persons’ internal states. These descriptions of behaviours and perceptive judgments allow us to make a link between internal state attributions and concrete physical expressions. Second, a novel method was used for expression exploration by transposing naturalistic behaviours to a virtual agent, Greta, which enables a fine tuning of expressions. In order to improve the synchronisation of behaviours the Multimodal Sequential Expression model was created for the Greta agent. Complex expressions were manipulated, one cue at a time, and expression were judged by participants, who were asked to attribute internal states to the agent. Results support the componential approaches to expression, in which particular cues are considered meaningful...|$|R
50|$|Merry Alpern (born 1955 in New York City) is an American {{photographer}} {{that has}} been shown in museums and exhibitions around the country including the Whitney Museum of American Art, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Museum of Modern Art, National Museum of Women in the Arts and The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. Her most notable work is her 1993-94 series Dirty Windows, a controversial series in which she took photos of an illegal sex club through a bathroom window in Manhattan near Wall Street. In 1994, the National Endowment for the Arts rejected recommended photography fellowships to Alpern, as well as Barbara DeGenevieve and Andres Serrano. Merry Alpern became one of many artists assaulted by congressional conservatives trying to defund the National Endowment for the Arts because of this series. As a result, museums such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York and San Francisco rushed to exhibit the series. She later produced and exhibited another show called Shopping which included images <b>from</b> <b>hidden</b> video <b>cameras.</b>|$|R
5000|$|As in {{the case}} of other Soviet space pioneers, the Soviet {{authorities}} for many years refused to disclose Kerimov's identity to the public. At televised space launchings, cameras always focused on the cosmonauts and not the person to whom they reported their readiness to carry out the mission. As Kerimov was a [...] "secreted general", he was always <b>hidden</b> <b>from</b> the <b>camera's</b> view; only his voice was broadcast. His name remained a secret until era of “glasnost” in Soviet Union, when he was first mentioned in Pravda newspaper in 1987.|$|R
500|$|Anderson {{remembers that}} Ferdy Mayne (Miles) {{occasionally}} misinterpreted the script. A scene between Oliver and Miriam Karlin (Connie Williams) at the café was re-mounted several times when Karlin repeatedly [...] "upstaged" [...] Oliver, changing {{the arrangement of}} the scene with the result that the other actor's face was <b>hidden</b> <b>from</b> the <b>camera.</b> Terence Brook, who was cast based on his [...] "tough-guy" [...] appearance in an advertisement for Strand cigarettes, was doubled by editor and second unit director David Elliott for a stunt sequence in which gang member Harry jumps off the back of a lorry.|$|R
40|$|By using {{time-of-flight}} information {{encoded in}} multiply scattered light, {{it is possible}} to reconstruct images of objects <b>hidden</b> <b>from</b> the <b>camera’s</b> direct line of sight. Here, we present a non-line-of-sight imaging system that uses a single-pixel, single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) to collect time-of-flight information. Compared to earlier systems, this modification provides significant improvements in terms of power requirements, form factor, cost, and reconstruction time, while maintaining a comparable time resolution. The potential for further size and cost reduction of this technology make this system a good base for developing a practical system {{that can be used in}} real world applications...|$|R
