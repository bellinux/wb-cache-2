40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of the new CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) of the European Union is the enhancement of environmental performance through a mandatory "greening" component of direct payments, which will support agricultural practices beneficial for the climate and the environment. A part of the financial support that farmers receive will be linked to simple, generalized, non-contractual farming practices that go beyond cross-compliance, such as crop diversification, the maintenance of permanent grassland, and the establishment of ecological focus areas. In order to better achieve {{the objectives}} of "greening" and to allow for its efficient administration and control, these practices are implemented {{depending on the size of}} the <b>eligible</b> <b>area</b> declared by the farmer and are compared to the whole area held by the applicant.

30|$|Since {{the very}} {{beginning}} of the 1990 s, one of the main application areas of remote sensing in agriculture in Europe has been the control of area-based agricultural subsidies given to the farmers in the framework of the common agricultural policy (CAP) [1]. For many years, this activity, also referred to as controls with remote sensing (CwRS), has consisted in checking whether the area and the crop type declared by the farmer are in line with the real situation as identified mainly from satellite remote sensing data. In the early years, when the identification of crop types was very important, both computer aided photo-interpretation methods (CAPI) and automatic classification procedures were involved in CwRS. Recent changes in the CAP decreased the importance of crop-type identification during the control procedure, while increasing the importance of the detection of anomalies related to the compliance with the rules defined as good agricultural and environmental conditions (GAEC). While CwRS covers the control aspect of the CAP management there is another important element: the land parcel identification system (LPIS). The LPIS is the so called reference system for locating and identifying each agricultural parcel in the EU that is declared in the farmers’ annual applications. The LPIS has to be as up to date as possible in order to reflect the real situation on the ground inside the LPIS parcels in terms of the correct quantification of the maximum <b>eligible</b> <b>area</b> in each LPIS parcel. For identification of these parcels, the use of digital geographic information system (GIS) techniques has been compulsory since January 2005, by a legislation change in 2000 [2].|$|E
40|$|Financial {{mechanisms}} such as offsets are {{one strategy}} to abate greenhouse gas emissions, and the carbon market is expanding {{with a growing}} demand for offset products. However, {{in the case of}} carbon offsets, if the carbon is released due to intentional or unintentional reversal through environmental events such as fire, the financial liability to replace lost offsets will likely fall on the provider. This liability may have implications for future participation in programmes, but common strategies such as buffer pool and insurance products can be used to minimize this liability. In order for these strategies to be effective, an understanding of the spatial and temporal distributions of expected reversals is needed. We use the case study of savanna burning, an approved greenhouse gas abatement methodology under the Carbon Farming Initiative in Australia, to examine potential risks to carbon markets in northern Australia and quantify the financial risks. We focus our analysis on the threat of Andropogon gayanus (gamba grass) to savanna burning due to its documented impacts of increased fuel loads and altered fire regimes. We assess the spatial and financial extent to which gamba grass poses a risk to savanna burning programmes in northern Australia. We find that 75 % of the <b>eligible</b> <b>area</b> for savanna burning is spatially coincident with the high suitability range for gamba grass. Our analysis demonstrates that the presence of gamba grass seriously impacts the financial viability of savanna burning projects. For example, in order to recuperate the annual costs of controlling 1 ha of gamba grass infestation, 290 ha of land must be enrolled in annual carbon abatement credits. Our results show an immediate need to contain gamba grass to its current extent to avoid future spread into large expanses of land, which are currently profitable for savanna burning. 10 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Kyoto Protocol, {{countries}} have significant latitude {{to define a}} forest. The most important parameter affecting area designated as forest is the minimum crown cover which can be set between 10 and 30 %. The choice will have implications {{for the amount of}} land available in a country for afforestation and reforestation activities within the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM-AR). In this paper, we present an analysis of the regional differences in land availability for CDM-AR projects. We then examine how the choice of a high or low threshold value for crown cover will affect the area available for CDM activities and how the limitations imposed by this element of the definition compares to other factors that are likely to limit CDM activities. Results represent a global analysis that included all countries not included in Annex I of the Kyoto Protocol, and examined the effect on land availability of a range of crown cover thresholds ranging from 10 – 30 %. Of the 140 Non-Annex One countries, 107 countries were found to have a potential for CDM-AR projects. Asia had the largest amount of combined area suitable for CDM-AR at the 10 % crown cover threshold level. However, at 30 %, South America had the greatest amount of land available, and a large change in available land area, which increased by almost five times compared to what was available at the 10 % threshold. The area available in Africa increased by a factor of 5. 5. Central America showed the largest increase, to almost 10 times more at the 30 % threshold. By contrast, within Asia, the area increase was comparatively less, but still the area nearly doubled. Globally, a low threshold of 10 % crown cover excluded almost 2 / 3 of the land identified that was eligible at 30 %, over 5 million km 2. The spatial analyses showed not only the effects of the choice of the crown cover criterion, but also where the land was available for CDM activities within each country at different thresholds.

40|$|The Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) is {{a spatial}} {{database}} of reference parcels managed by Member States {{in the context}} of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The maximum <b>eligible</b> <b>area</b> is a crucial attribute of reference parcel for the area-based subsidies. An ineligible elements included in the reference parcel creates the non-conformities or anomalies. This database should be up to date with respect to all the elements which are ineligible for subsidies. In order to achieve this objective, Member States renew their entire orthocoverage every 3 to 5 years. In the consequence, the ¿millions¿ of reference parcels boundaries in the LPIS should then be verified by operators through Computer Aided Photo Interpretation. However, fully manual revision (parcel by parcel) is time consuming and expensive, thus an automatic detection of parcels that potentially need to be updated could significantly improve the time efficiency and reduce the cost of the update process. The aim of this thesis was to develop an automated method for detection of nonconformities in the LPIS in order to support a systematic update process. The proposed method uses the data available in the LPIS and considers the actual update needs. In order to understand the essential update needs and to address the challenge correctly, extensive analyses of anomalies in the systems were undertaken. In the survey more than 21 000 parcels in 12 zones located in 11 Member States were examined. In total close to 10 000 anomalies were found. It was stated that, more than 50 % of all the identified anomalies were caused by patches of trees and buildings located in the reference parcels. Therefore the further research work was focused on outline extraction of selected (building and patches of tree) objects. The developed object extraction method in order to detect selected objects takes advantage of fusion of the radiometric image characteristic (NDVI) with the height data (normalised Digital Surface Model). Two approaches were combined: pixel-based - to localise the potential target objects (called object primitives) and object-based - to delineate 5 outlines of buildings and patches of trees. This combination reduced the processing time since the object-based method was applied only on the subsets of the image where the objects are located, instead of applying heavy computation analysis to the entire image scene. On the other hand, the potential candidate localisation gave better class separation due to reduction of class variability between the full image space and small image subsets containing the primitives. In the object-based approach the Mean Shift segmentation algorithm, developed in the field of Computer Vision, was successfully applied to the aerial ortho-imagery in order to partition the image into adjacent regions. To assure the correctness of the segmentation, considered as a key element of object-based analyses, the segmentation parameters were optimized to the characteristic of the target objects. It was demonstrated that using a standard image LPIS dataset as input to the proposed object extraction method, it is possible to automatically detect 96 % of potential nonconformities caused by buildings and 100 % caused by patches of trees. The UltraCamD image data were found suitable for the automated image analyses and capable of serving as a source for the Digital Surface Model generation using the commercial off-the-shelf software in the agricultural environment. In line with the objectives of the thesis, to reach the automated solution for detection of object causing the LPIS non-conformities, the proposed method of object extraction was implemented in the IDL programming environment.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{is part of the}} EU Integrated Project “GEHA – Genetics of Healthy Aging” (Franceschi C et al., Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1100 : 21 - 45, 2007), whose aim is to {{identify}} genes involved in healthy aging and longevity, which allow individuals to survive to advanced age in good cognitive and physical function {{and in the absence of}} major age-related diseases. Aims The major aims of this thesis were the following: 1. to outline the recruitment procedure of 90 + Italian siblings performed by the recruiting units of the University of Bologna (UNIBO) and Rome (ISS). The procedures related to the following items necessary to perform the study were described and commented: identification of the <b>eligible</b> <b>area</b> for recruitment, demographic aspects related to the need of getting census lists of 90 +siblings, mail and phone contact with 90 + subjects and their families, bioethics aspects of the whole procedure, standardization of the recruitment methodology and set-up of a detailed flow chart to be followed by the European recruitment centres (obtainment of the informed consent form, anonimization of data by using a special code, how to perform the interview, how to collect the blood, how to enter data in the GEHA Phenotypic Data Base hosted at Odense). 2. to provide an overview of the phenotypic characteristics of 90 + Italian siblings recruited by the recruiting units of the University of Bologna (UNIBO) and Rome (ISS). The following items were addressed: socio-demographic characteristics, health status, cognitive assessment, physical conditions (handgrip strength test, chair-stand test, physical ability including ADL, vision and hearing ability, movement ability and doing light housework), life-style information (smoking and drinking habits) and subjective well-being (attitude towards life). Moreover, haematological parameters collected in the 90 + sibpairs as optional parameters by the Bologna and Rome recruiting units were used for a more comprehensive evaluation of the results obtained using the above mentioned phenotypic characteristics reported in the GEHA questionnaire. 3. to assess 90 + Italian siblings as far as their health/functional status is concerned on the basis of three classification methods proposed in previous studies on centenarians, which are based on: •	actual functional capabilities (ADL, SMMSE, visual and hearing abilities) (Gondo et al., J Gerontol. 61 A (3) : 305 - 310, 2006); •	actual functional capabilities and morbidity (ADL, ability to walk, SMMSE, presence of cancer, ictus, renal failure, anaemia, and liver diseases) (Franceschi et al., Aging Clin Exp Res, 12 : 77 - 84, 2000); •	retrospectively collected data about past history of morbidity and age of disease onset (hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, stroke, cancer, osteopororis, neurological diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and ocular diseases) (Evert et al., J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci. 58 A (3) : 232 - 237, 2003). Firstly these available models to define the health status of long-living subjects were applied to the sample and, since the classifications by Gondo and Franceschi are both based on the present functional status, they were compared in order to better recognize the healthy aging phenotype and to identify the best group of 90 + subjects out of the entire studied population. 4. to investigate the concordance of health and functional status among 90 + siblings in order to divide sibpairs in three categories: the best (both sibs are in good shape), the worst (both sibs are in bad shape) and an intermediate group (one sib is in good shape and the other is in bad shape). Moreover, the evaluation wanted to discover which variables are concordant among siblings; thus, concordant variables could be considered as familiar variables (determined by the environment or by genetics). 5. to perform a survival analysis by using mortality data at 1 st January 2009 from the follow-up as the main outcome and selected functional and clinical parameters as explanatory variables. Methods A total of 765 90 + Italian subjects recruited by UNIBO (549 90 + siblings, belonging to 258 families) and ISS (216 90 + siblings, belonging to 106 families) recruiting units are included in the analysis. Each subject was interviewed according to a standardized questionnaire, comprising extensively utilized questions that have been validated in previous European studies on elderly subjects and covering demographic information, life style, living conditions, cognitive status (SMMSE), mood, health status and anthropometric measurements. Moreover, subjects were asked to perform some physical tests (Hand Grip Strength test and Chair Standing test) and a sample of about 24 mL of blood was collected and then processed according to a common protocol for the preparation and storage of DNA aliquots. Results From the analysis the main findings are the following: - a standardized protocol to assess cognitive status, physical performances and health status of European nonagenarian subjects was set up, in respect to ethical requirements, and it is available as a reference for other studies in this field; - GEHA families are enriched in long-living members and extreme survival, and represent an appropriate model for the identification of genes involved in healthy aging and longevity; - two simplified sets of criteria to classify 90 + sibling according to their health status were proposed, as operational tools for distinguishing healthy from non healthy subjects; - cognitive and functional parameters have a major role in categorizing 90 + siblings for the health status; - parameters such as education and good physical abilities (500 metres walking ability, going up and down the stairs ability, high scores at hand grip and chair stand tests) are associated with a good health status (defined as “cognitive unimpairment and absence of disability”); - male nonagenarians show a more homogeneous phenotype than females, and, though far fewer in number, tend to be healthier than females; - in males the good health status is not protective for survival, confirming the male-female health survival paradox; - survival after age 90 was dependent mainly on intact cognitive status and absence of functional disabilities; - haemoglobin and creatinine levels are both associated with longevity; - the most concordant items among 90 + siblings are related to the functional status, indicating that they contain a familiar component. It is still to be investigated at what level this familiar component is determined by genetics or by environment or by the interaction between genetics, environment and chance (and at what level). Conclusions In conclusion, we could state that this study, in accordance with the main objectives of the whole GEHA project, represents one of the first attempt to identify the biological and non biological determinants of successful/unsuccessful aging and longevity. Here, the analysis was performed on 90 + siblings recruited in Northern and Central Italy and it could be used as a reference for others studies in this field on Italian population. Moreover, it contributed to the definition of “successful” and “unsuccessful” aging and categorising a very large cohort of our most elderly subjects into “successful” and “unsuccessful” groups provided an unrivalled opportunity to detect some of the basic genetic/molecular mechanisms which underpin good health as opposed to chronic disability. Discoveries in the topic of the biological determinants of healthy aging represent a real possibility to identify new markers to be utilized for the identification of subgroups of old European citizens having a higher risk to develop age-related diseases and disabilities and to direct major preventive medicine strategies for the new epidemic of chronic disease in the 21 st century. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Research on Natural Gas Hydrate（NGH）is {{very popular}} in recent years. NGH is a potential, new and clean energy with the {{characteristics}} of high energy density, high combustion heat, high proven reserves, no pollution, wide distribution and shallow burial and so on. It has been identified that NGH is widely distributed in the plateau, arctic permafrost and some <b>eligible</b> <b>areas</b> in the seabed of epicontinental and continental slope all around the world. According to the research data on NGH at home and abroad, the mineralizing, formation, distribution and exploration technology of NGH are introduced {{as well as the}} NGH research status of countries in the world, including China. Many theories and techniques about the exploitation of NGH are not mature yet. Numerous problems still exist in industrial mining NGH, such as environmental, geological problems induced by mining NGH and storage and transportation problems after mining. Finally, the application and mining prospects of NGH are prospected and summarized to provide a relatively comprehensive reference to this research field...|$|R
40|$|The UK {{government}} places considerable {{emphasis on}} the targeting of resources to areas most in need. For the Single Regeneration Budget and other purposes, use is made of the Index of Local Deprivation (ILD), formerly the Index of Local Conditions (ILC), to identify <b>eligible</b> <b>areas.</b> In this paper we show that this index suffers from such serious structural defects that it is unsuitable for the purpose {{to which it is}} put. These defects include the scale dependency of the index, the inappropriate treatment of positive and negative numbers, the unequal weights assigned to the indicators used and the difficulties introduced by using a nonlinear structure for the index. Recent decisions to modify the ILD do not address these defects and one change that has been mooted would exaggerate the scale bias. Suggestions are made for what should be done in replacing and supplementing the ILD to provide a better basis for assessing relative need. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{evaluates the}} {{effectiveness}} of ex-post targeting of the direct payment program for mountain agriculture in Japan. A regression analysis explaining the entry into the program shows that the farm profitability and the production cost were significant positive and negative factor, respectively, in determining the uptake, while the efforts by local governments were a robust factor in facilitating the enrollment. These findings imply ineffective ex-post targeting and call for the differentiation of the premium, alternative incentives to promote forestation for the un-enrolled fields and additional funds targeted to those prefectures with the low uptake ratio. Lessons drawn from the Japanese experience for effective incentive measures in developing countries {{include the use of}} composite indicators in designating <b>eligible</b> <b>areas</b> to avoid the risk of insufficient targeting and the engagement of local governments to facilitate the entry through the reduction of transaction costs among participants. cost-effectiveness, direct payment, environmental services, mountain farming, targeting, transaction costs, Japan, Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|R
