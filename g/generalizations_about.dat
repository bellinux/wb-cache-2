25|$|Because {{the vast}} {{majority}} of triple X females are never diagnosed, it may be very difficult to make <b>generalizations</b> <b>about</b> the effects of this syndrome. The samples that were studied were small and may be nonrepresentative. Because of the lyonization, inactivation, and formation of Barr bodies in all female cells, only one X chromosome is active at any time. Thus, triple X syndrome most often has only mild effects or has no effects. The symptoms vary from person to person, with some women being more affected than others.|$|E
25|$|Dewey {{believed}} that a woman’s place in society was determined by her environment and not just her biology. On women he says, “You think too much of women in terms of sex. Think of them as human individuals for a while, dropping out the sex qualification, and you won’t be so sure of some of your <b>generalizations</b> <b>about</b> what they should and shouldn’t do”. John Dewey’s support helped to increase the support and popularity of Jane Addams’ Hull House and other settlement houses as well. With growing support, involvement of the community grew {{as well as the}} support for the women’s suffrage movement.|$|E
25|$|In Book I Thomas {{addresses}} Froude's {{claims in}} the early portions of The English in the West Indies. Froude's tendency to state incorrect assumptions as fact is roundly assaulted. Thomas criticizes Froude for making sweeping <b>generalizations</b> <b>about</b> the condition of blacks on multiple islands without ever talking or interacting with the people he was writing about. Thomas points out that Froude comments extensively on the lifestyles of the natives of Grenada when his only experience among the natives was peering into their houses as he rode past in a carriage. Thomas attacks many other different factual inaccuracies in Froude's work.|$|E

25|$|Although it is {{difficult}} to make accurate <b>generalizations</b> <b>about</b> reverse imagery, as this was something that varied by emperor, some trends do exist. An example is reverse types of the military emperors {{during the second half of}} the third century, where virtually all of the types were the common and standard personifications and deities. A possible explanation for the lack of originality is that these emperors were attempting to present conservative images to establish their legitimacy, something that many of these emperors lacked. Although these emperors relied on traditional reverse types, their portraits often emphasized their authority through stern gazes, and even featured the bust of the emperor clad in armor.|$|E
25|$|Interaction {{of actors}} has no {{specific}} beginning or end. It goes on forever. Since {{it does so}} it has very peculiar properties. Whereas a conversation is mapped (due to a possibility of obtaining a vague kinematic, perhaps picture-frame image, of it, onto Newtonian time, precisely {{because it has a}} beginning and end), an interaction, in general, cannot be treated in this manner. Kinematics are inadequate to deal with life: we need kinetics. Even so as in the minimal case of a strict conversation we cannot construct the truth value, metaphor or analogy of A and B. The A, B differences are <b>generalizations</b> <b>about</b> a coalescence of concepts on the part of A and B; their commonality and coherence is the similarity. The difference (reiterated) is the differentiation of A and B (their agreements to disagree, their incoherences). Truth value in this case meaning the coherence between all of the interacting actors.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Urban Institute economists C. Eugene Steuerle and Adam Carasso {{created a}} Web-based Social Security {{benefits}} calculator. The calculator {{does not include}} the value or cost of the Social Security disability program. Using this calculator it is possible to estimate net Social Security benefits (i.e., estimated lifetime benefits minus estimated lifetime FICA taxes paid) for different types of recipients. In the book Democrats and Republicans – Rhetoric and Reality Joseph Fried used the calculator to create graphical depictions of the estimated net benefits {{of men and women who}} were at different wage levels, single and married (with stay-at-home spouses), and retiring in different years. These graphs vividly show that <b>generalizations</b> <b>about</b> Social Security benefits may be of little predictive value for any given worker, due to the wide disparity of net benefits for people at different income levels and in different demographic groups. For example, the graph below (Figure 168) shows the impact of wage level and retirement date on a male worker. As income goes up, net benefits get smaller – even negative.|$|E

In particular, Hurley highlights {{the juxtaposition of}} Mayotte and her twin, because the many differences between the two, despite their genetic similarities, “negate <b>generalization</b> <b>about</b> Mayotte's life and identity choices as a woman and free her to act contrary to the role prescribed for her by the ideological system of a Fanon.” ...|$|R
25|$|As {{a result}} of the Obama sweep in 2008, many Democratic {{candidates}} in contests for lower-level offices also benefited, and many Republican incumbents were replaced by Democrats in the Harris County courthouse. Some of the defeated Republican district court judges were later re-appointed to vacant District Court benches by Governor Rick Perry. Republicans continue to hold all statewide offices after the 2014 elections, including all nine slots on each of the two high courts, but Harris County still has a mix of Democratic and Republican district court judges. All members of the two courts of appeals in the old Harris County Courthouse, by contrast, are Republicans. They are elected from an appellate district that includes Harris County, but also includes nine other counties that are more conservative and vote more Republican. Any <b>generalizations</b> <b>about</b> political leanings and voting patterns of the local electorate must take into consideration the geographic area/jurisdiction, and the same goes for public-opinion polls. Whether elections for local offices coincide with presidential elections or midterm elections also matters because turnout and composition of the voting segment of the electorate differ. The City of Houston, which overlaps with Harris County in part, but represents a smaller and more urban area and electorate, is even more liberal. That is why the city can elect a mayor who is not only a Democrat, but openly gay. (Mayoral elections are nominally nonpartisan).|$|E

5000|$|Music-induced {{hearing loss}} {{is still a}} {{controversial}} topic for hearing researchers. While some populational {{studies have shown that}} the risk for hearing loss increases as music exposure increases, other studies found little to no correlation between the two. Experts at the 2006 [...] "Noise-Induced Hearing Loss in Children at Work and Play" [...] Conference agreed that further research into this field was still required before making a broad <b>generalization</b> <b>about</b> music-induced hearing loss.|$|R

Bees are the only animals that perform this behaviour. Bumblebees sonicate, but honeybees do not.|$|R
500|$|Following the Heaven's Gate mass suicide on March 26, 1997, Mexican journalists {{asked which}} {{religious}} group at home could stage similar acts. The following day, in TV Azteca's flagship program, Jorge Erdely Graham {{leader of the}} obscure anti-cult group Instituto Cristiano de Mexico (Christian Institute of Mexico) pointed to La Luz del Mundo as a group {{with the potential to}} commit mass suicide. Erdely's claims were based on an interview with three church members conducted two years earlier. La Luz del Mundo denied the claims arguing that the answers of three individuals cannot be used to make <b>generalizations</b> <b>about</b> an entire community. Religious scholars Gordon Melton and David Bromley characterized the accusations as [...] "fraudulent reports by ideological enemies." [...] Anthropologist Elio Masferrer Kan criticized the methodology employed in the interview, noting that the interviewer cornered the subjects to obtain the desired response.|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Evan Serpick of Entertainment Weekly awarded the album a [...] "B". While {{he felt that}} [...] "Couch Potato" [...] was, musically, up to par with Eminem's original, he noted, [...] "It’s hard to imagine today’s tough tykes choosing" [...] {{to listen to the}} somewhat tame parody. Serpick also felt that the Nelly and Avril Lavigne parodies were [...] "full of noisome effects and clownish voices that would make even the widest eyes roll." [...] He ended his review by praising the album's polka medley, saying it [...] "exposes the songs for the pretentious rock babble they are." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic claimed that the album was evidence that [...] "pop culture [...] ahead of Weird Al". He felt that many of songs belied an inherent misconception of youth culture on the part of Yankovic, and that with Poodle Hat, the artist was [...] "offering <b>generalizations</b> <b>about</b> a culture he doesn't understand". But while he claimed that the record [...] "stumbles over the obviousness and awfulness of its parodies", Erlewine enjoyed [...] "Hardware Store," [...] "Why Does This Always Happen to Me?", and [...] "Genius in France" [...] (for being [...] "complicated" [...] and [...] "intricate"; a sensitive piano pop tune with a good send-up of narcissistic lyrics and nice, layered vocal harmonies; and [...] "the most ambitious and weirdest thing here, which counts for a lot," [...] respectively). The writers of The Rolling Stone Album Guide awarded the album two stars, denoting a record that is [...] "fair to poor" [...] and that [...] "fall below an artist's establish standard". A review of the album by Billboard, however, praised the album, noting that it [...] "crackles with amusing parodies", proving that Yankovic is [...] "a sharp observer of the world—and that's what makes [...] such an enduring, compelling figure." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{reviewer}} for Anime News Network, Mikhail Koulikov {{wrote that}} readers would have various reactions to The One I Love: {{he felt that}} some would regard it as [...] "charming" [...] and others would find it upsetting that the female protagonists were primarily defined by their worry over their relationships. While considering it one of Clamp's minor works, he stated that it was [...] "unusual" [...] for including some colored pages when the majority of manga is printed in black and white; being a slice-of-life manga; and featuring Tsubaki Nekoi's art, as prior {{to the time of}} his review, most of their works translated into English had been drawn by another member of Clamp. Koulikov wrote that [...] "insecurity and self-doubt" [...] served as the theme of the anthology. Johanna Draper Carlson, a reviewer for Publishers Weekly, wrote that some of the stories were worrisome, particularly one that she felt [...] "justifies having an interest in whatever your boyfriend likes," [...] and contained stereotypes as a result of limited space. She also stated that the essays included <b>generalizations</b> <b>about</b> women and [...] "quickly become redundant." [...] In , Mason Templar suggested a possible theme of being one's self in [...] relationships, but felt that it appeared [...] "almost anti-feminist in execution," [...] as only the female characters underwent a change in behavior. Templar rated the series one-and-a-half out of four stars, and criticized it as a naïve take on romance; Templar suggested Cardcaptor Sakura, Chobits, or Man of Many Faces as better examples of Clamp's romantic manga. A reviewer of the French edition wrote that repetitive nature of the stories detracted from the manga's appeal, and made for a [...] "laborious" [...] reading experience, although the reviewer felt that a [...] "romantic" [...] reader would not mind this. Conversely, another reviewer for Anime News Network, Liann Cooper, wrote that the stories were [...] "incredibly sweet and touching" [...] and were best read a few stories at a time. According to Cooper, The One I Love would appeal to fans of Clamp or shōjo, manga targeted towards girls.|$|E
30|$|Based on the {{strategies}} to build theories identified by Wieringa and Daneva (2015), we can {{notice that the}} SoftCoDeR approach allows a hybrid strategy. In the first two cycles, the artifacts were validated during observational studies. In these cases, the strategy for generalization was a case-based research, in which artifacts were investigated in field with real projects. In this strategy, from the investigation of a single project, {{we were able to}} hypothesize a <b>generalization</b> <b>about</b> all similar projects in the partner company.|$|R
