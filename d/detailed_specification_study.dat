40|$|Having a good {{understanding}} of the load requirements in the datacenter improves the capability to effectively provision the resources available to the meet the demands and objectives of application services. Especially in a large project like XIFI this aspect becomes even more critical because of the limited availability of the resources and the complexity of the various entities present. In this study we frame a structure that provides deep insights to comprehend XIFI infrastructure. Further, we model the user requests that approach the node for resource allocation to run their applications. We aim to provide an understanding on different aspects involved in modelling. The objective of this present study is to investigate the effect of load on the XIFI node. To achieve this objective, we model the XIFI node by examining the various entities involved in it. Furthermore, we provide an overview about what constitutes as load in the XIFI node. We conduct a <b>detailed</b> <b>specifications</b> <b>study</b> after which we identify the imperative entities required for the modelling of both the XIFI node and the requests. We examine the model by simulating it in CloudSim for two different scenarios varying the specifications. We simulated the designed structure for 30 iterations and analyzed 10, 000 user requests for two cases where total RAM of the node is increased in the second case when compared to the first case. We analyze the CPU usage, RAM usage, Bandwidth usage and Storage usage in both the cases and examine the effects of the user requests on each one of them. The results provided evidence that the load indices on the host are dependent on each other. Also, it showed that the request modelling {{had an impact on the}} load of the host. It can also be concluded that the resource provisioning can be effective if the user behavior is known...|$|R

40|$|This study {{documents}} extreme {{variations in}} productivity within {{a panel of}} eleven firms in the same narrowly defined industry classification. Many {{of the sources of}} this variation were identified in field investigations of each plant. These investigations in turn allowed for the development of <b>detailed</b> <b>specifications</b> for inputs and outputs using data collected from the sites. The empirical estimates show that, irrespective of the precise functional form adopted, these <b>detailed</b> <b>specifications,</b> particularly those for output heterogeneity, are critical determinants of the performance of plant-level production functions. When the most detailed input and output specifications are used, 95 % of the observed variation in plant production is explained. However, when the eleven firms are treated as an industry, less <b>detailed</b> <b>specifications</b> for inputs and outputs are shown to be more appropriate for explaining the variation in industry production. ...|$|R
