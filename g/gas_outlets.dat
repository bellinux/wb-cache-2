This paper describes a radiotracer investigation carried out to measure RTDs of coal particles in a pilot-scale PFBG with objectives to determine mean residence time (MRT) of coal/ash particles in the gasifier and estimate degree of mixing at different operating and process conditions.

40|$|During {{solar cell}} firing, {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOC) and {{a small number of}} metal particles were removed using the gas flow. When the gas flow was disturbed by the thermal field of infrared belt furnace and structure, the metal particles in the discharging gas flow randomly adhered to the surface of solar cell, possibly causing contamination. Meanwhile, the gas flow also affected the thermal uniformity of the solar cell. In this paper, the heating mechanism of the solar cell caused by radiation, convection, and conduction during firing was analyzed. Afterward, four 2 -dimensional (2 D) models of the furnace were proposed. The transient thermal fields with different gas inlets, outlets, and internal structures were simulated. The thermal fields and the temperature of the solar cell could remain stable and uniform when the <b>gas</b> <b>outlets</b> were installed at the ends {{and in the middle of}} the furnace, with the gas inlets being distributed evenly. To verify the results, we produced four types of furnaces according to the four simulated results.

40|$|International audienceFor {{more than}} 20 years, seismo-hydrological {{investigations}} have been undertaken at the mineral aquifer system of Bad Brambach (Vogtland, Germany). Two strong swarm earthquake series in 2000 - 01 and 2008 - 09 at the Nový Kostel epicentre (Czech Republic, 10 km E of BB) have enabled {{for the first}} time a comparison of seismological and groundwater hydraulic features in a semi-quantitative way. In spite of their similar spatial distribution in 2001 and 2008, the earthquake foci of each swarm migrated differently through time, horizontally as well as in depth. The seismic energy of the 2008 - 2009 events was released predominantly within one month, in contrast to 2000 - 2001 when it occurred over three months. The main distinctive features of each are seen in the hydraulic pressure anomalies which accompanied the earthquake swarms: number, shape, and progression (duration) of the anomalies. The comprehensive hydraulic data, with high temporal resolution, suggest that fluid triggering dominated not only the earthquake initiating phases. In particular, the long lasting seismicity of the 2008 - 2009 swarm can be attributed to a continued triggering of weak earthquakes by over-pressured deep fluids. Here, the remaining static strain was obviously not sufficient to generate strong earthquakes as at the beginning of the earthquake swarm periods. Furthermore, the enduring high fluid pressure in 2009 could also indicate a continuation of the long-term gas flow increase observed at several <b>gas</b> <b>outlets</b> in the Vogtland/NW Bohemia region between 1998 and 2008.
