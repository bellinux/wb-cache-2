5|$|In {{quantum field}} theory, one {{typically}} computes the probabilities of various physical events using {{the techniques of}} perturbation theory. Developed by Richard Feynman {{and others in the}} first half of the twentieth century, perturbative quantum field theory uses special <b>diagrams</b> called Feynman <b>diagrams</b> to organize computations. One imagines that these <b>diagrams</b> depict the paths of point-like particles and their interactions. Although this formalism is extremely useful for making predictions, these predictions are only possible when the strength of the interactions, the coupling constant, is small enough to reliably describe the theory as being close to a theory without interactions.|$|E

40|$|When {{modeling}} {{systems and}} using UML concepts, a real {{system can be}} viewed in several ways. The RUP (Rational Unified Process) defines the " 4 + 1 view": 1. Logical view (class <b>diagram</b> (CD), object <b>diagram</b> (OD), sequence <b>diagram</b> (SD), collaboration <b>diagram</b> (COD), state chart <b>diagram</b> (SCD), activity <b>diagram</b> (AD)), 2. Process view (use case <b>diagram,</b> CD, OD, SD, COD, SCD, AD), 3. Development view (package <b>diagram,</b> component <b>diagram),</b> 4. Physical view (deployment <b>diagram),</b> and 5. Use case view (use case <b>diagram,</b> OD, SD, COD, SCD, AD) which combines the four mentioned above. With sequence <b>diagram</b> constructs we are describing object behavior in scope of one use case and their interaction. Each object in system goes through a so called lifecycle (create, supplement object with data, use object, decommission object). The concept of the object lifecycle is used to understand and formalize the behavior of objects from creation to deletion. With help of sequence <b>diagram</b> concepts our paper will describe the way of interaction modeling between objects through lifeline of each of them, and their importance in software development...|$|R

5|$|In {{computational}} geometry, the duality between Voronoi <b>diagrams</b> and Delaunay triangulations {{implies that}} any algorithm for constructing a Voronoi diagram can be immediately converted into an algorithm for the Delaunay triangulation, and vice versa. The same duality {{can also be}} used in finite element mesh generation. Lloyd's algorithm, a method based on Voronoi <b>diagrams</b> for moving a set of points on a surface to more evenly spaced positions, is commonly used as a way to smooth a finite element mesh described by the dual Delaunay triangulation. This method improves the mesh by making its triangles more uniformly sized and shaped.|$|E
5|$|In general relativity, no {{material}} body {{can catch up}} with or overtake a light pulse. No influence from an event A can reach any other location X before light sent out at A to X. In consequence, an exploration of all light worldlines (null geodesics) yields key information about the spacetime's causal structure. This structure can be displayed using Penrose–Carter <b>diagrams</b> in which infinitely large regions of space and infinite time intervals are shrunk ("compactified") so as to fit onto a finite map, while light still travels along diagonals as in standard spacetime <b>diagrams.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In a <b>diagram</b> editor, one can {{distinguish}} initial from incremental <b>diagram</b> layout. The former computes a <b>diagram</b> layout from scratch, whereas the latter adjusts an existing layout after <b>diagram</b> modifications. In previous work, we {{have proposed a}} pattern-based approach as a solution for in-cremental <b>diagram</b> layout in visual language editors. Each LP encapsulates certain layout behavior. A <b>diagram’s</b> layout is then defined by simultaneously applying several LPs to the <b>diagram.</b> This solution has been designed for an interactive en-vironment where the user may select and alter the layout behavior at runtime. This paper describes an extension of this approach that now supports initial <b>diagram</b> lay-out, too. While the old version only enabled freehand editing, the extended version now supports <b>diagram</b> import and structured editing as well...|$|R
