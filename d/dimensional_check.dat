40|$|In {{some kind}} of {{mechanical}} products, the correct assembly is obtained considering also the deformations of every single element; sometimes this condition ensures the respect of design functionality. In this case, the calculation and allocation of dimensional and geometric tolerances is particularly difficult. In fact, with common GT&D method, the single parts are considered as rigid and the functional tolerancing method {{does not take into}} account deformations. The only reference standard is UNI ISO 10579 for flexible assembly. Moreover, its prescriptions are only general indications useful only for <b>dimensional</b> <b>check.</b> In such event, it must be held in consideration also the deformability of every part together with the imposed tolerances and together with the stress level due to the assembly process. This paper proposes a methodology to estimate the combined effects of geometric errors and admissible deformations, for assigning tolerances that ensure the respect of functional requirements of the assemblies. A simple pin-hole connection has been proposed as an example; the case examined is composed of two cylindrical pins and their relative holes. The assessment of multiple effects of geometric tolerances and pin deformations, and the possibility of connections with respect to functional conditions are been investigated. First of all, all possible assembly configurations have been estimated considering the bodies as rigid. Subsequently, all not mountable assemblies have been analyzed including pin deformations. The percentage of reject parts has been carried out with a statistical method (Montecarlo method) while the stress analysis has been performed using Finite Elements Model...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} is structured around two parallel tracks; one {{linked to the}} historical reconstruction of the implementation phases {{of the church of}} St. Mary of Loreto in Rome, on which there is an interesting and detailed archive of material and a small bibliography; the other involves the comparison between the original Sangallo project and the instrumental survey of the existing situation through a specific photographic campaign. It is interesting to point out the existing similarities that were revealed between this comparison, which led to a 3 D reconstruction of the project in phase 1. The research project is configured as a monographic study of the Church, but especially {{on one of the most}} significant phases of the construction. In particular, themes connected to a check of the initial project (1507 - 1509) were investigated in depth and, therefore, also the ones that were more strictly connected to the construction plan of the church, from the moment the works were started to their completion (1509 - 1580). This phase is well documented in the text of S. Benedetti on the church, but there aren't any pictures or drawings made by others other than the author's to document this phase. The only iconographic documentation is the Map of Rome of 1561 by Giovanni Antonio Dosio, in which the church is reproduced as far as its foundation is concerned with a double pitched roof and, later, also in an engraving of Cavallieri (National Cabinet of Prints, no. 121). As far as the attribution of the original project is concerned, one of the first examples of a church with a central plan is the one built in Rome in the first half of the sixteenth century. The bibliographical sources and archives agree on when the works started, around 1507 - 1509, while there still is some doubt as to whether the work was attributed to Bramante or Antonio da Sangallo. The work method with which the research was made is based on the analysis and elaboration of the data retrieved during the archival research and on the field. The photographic campaign substantially allowed us to reconstruct the church and provided the numerical data needed to carry out the <b>dimensional</b> <b>check</b> between the current state and the original designs. The historical documents used for this reconstruction were preserved in the Archive of the Pio Sodalizio dei Fornari of Rome. As far as the iconographic sources are concerned, we consulted: the National Cabinet of Prints of Rome, the Municipal Cabinet of Prints of Rome and, finally, the “Congregazione del Censo” fund of the State Archive of Rome. The building implementation of the church of St. Mary of Loreto, made possible thanks to offers and the legacies of the Fornari, was linked to spontaneous initiatives, reason for which a continuous execution of the works was not ensured, which made the historical reconstruction and its implementation phases more complex. As confirmed by Sandro Benedetti, the first building phase, the one that dates back to 1507 - 1576, is without a doubt the one that most significantly marked the importance the church would have had over the century for the religious community. It would soon become a place of worship for the entire Fornari community that resided in the area surrounding the Alessandrino District. The evolution of the church can be narrowed down into two phases: the first, from the foundations of 1507 to 1552 when the building reached the first level, or the base ground up to the frame. This phase was attributed to Antonio da Sangallo and also to Bramante in part. The external architectural layout was achieved in the only main façade around 1550, while the other two were completed around 1573 and 1574 by Giacomo del Duca. The second, from 1577 to 1580, and in which the complex dome system was entirely built. The date on which the works started is cited by Armellini, Lanciani and finally confirmed in the documents contained in the church's archives and which show the original foundation bull issued by Giulio II. The works actually started again in 1577 and, if we compare the date 1592 engraved in the base of the dome, we immediately see it took twenty years to accomplish the dome...|$|E

As {{a result of}} these outages, many industries have attempted prevention by unnecessary inspections and premature bearing replacement. This work can be associated with significant incurred costs. Bearing failures often occur after a lengthy process of wear, related to factors such as abrasion, corrosion, and erosion. Over the years, several techniques for indirectly measuring bearing condition have been developed and used. These techniques, however, provide imprecise measurements of bearing damage and wear rates. Until recently, the only direct measure of bearing condition was visual inspection and <b>dimensional</b> <b>checks,</b> both requiring shutdown and disassembly. A bearing wear monitoring system has been developed to eliminate the interpretation of indirect symptoms and the need for bearing disassembly. The level of accuracy provides a diagnostic ability far more sensitive to wear than indirect methods such as vibration monitoring. In addition, the system provides data on the location and the extent of the problem. Finally, the ultrasonic technique reduces inspection costs, and eliminates the risk of improper reassembly that may follow inspections...|$|R

2500|$|Glass {{containers}} are 100% inspected; automatic machines, {{or sometimes}} persons, inspect every container {{for a variety}} of faults. Typical faults include small cracks in the glass called checks and foreign inclusions called stones which are pieces of the refractory brick lining of the melting furnace that break off and fall into the pool of molten glass, or more commonly oversized silica granules (sand) that have failed to melt and which subsequently are included in the final product. [...] These are especially important to select out {{due to the fact that}} they can impart a destructive element to the final glass product. [...] For example, since these materials can withstand large amounts of thermal energy, they can cause the glass product to sustain thermal shock resulting in explosive destruction when heated. Other defects include bubbles in the glass called blisters and excessively thin walls. Another defect common in glass manufacturing is referred to as a tear. [...] In the press and blow forming, if a plunger and mould are out of alignment, or heated to an incorrect temperature, the glass will stick to either item and become torn. [...] In addition to rejecting faulty containers, inspection equipment gathers statistical information and relays it to the forming machine operators in the hot end. Computer systems collect fault information and trace it to the mould that produced the container. This is done by reading the mould number on the container, which is encoded (as a numeral, or a binary code of dots) on the container by the mould that made it.

40|$|The {{results of}} the CORD {{feasibility}} study carried out {{at the beginning of}} the present research showed that little research has been done regarding the design and manufacturing processes of large customised titanium implants used for maxillofacial reconstruction. The large titanium implants, as a facsimile of the resected bone, used by the surgeon Mr. Ninian Peckitt, have used many techniques of Computer Assisted Surgery (CAS) to address “functional” surgical reconstruction. This project was about taking the existing, successful implant further along the road of CAS and improving the design and manufacturing processes. The research study consisted in an integrated approach from design process and manufacture to dimensional quality assurance for the developed customised maxillofacial implant. As the research has been completed successfully, a method has been devised to optimise the design process of a customised implant by using solid modelling techniques. Software used to do this was MIMICS from Materialise, Pro/ENGINEER from PTC and 3 DataDesign from DeskArtes. The procedure initiated with the CT scans, which were converted and transferred to CAE software. The implant was designed virtually with respect to the patient anatomy and was thus accurate and patient specific. The result was an assembly of the CAD model representation of the patient anatomy and the implant, which fitted perfectly to the anatomical geometry. The implant was brought into Finite Element Analysis (FEA) environment, meshing of the component parts of the implant was investigated in HyperMesh from Altair Eng. and statically analysed for the stress distribution within ANSYS software when loaded with the average bite force identified in specialised publications. The final tasks of the research included: titanium casting manufacturing process of the implant, dimensional/tolerance checking to verify the dimensional accuracy of the cast implant and performance testing to verify the reliability of the material used.

40|$|We define {{smoothed}} Wilson loop operators on a four <b>dimensional</b> lattice and <b>check</b> numerically {{that they}} have a finite and nontrivial continuum limit. The continuum operators maintain their character as unitary matrices and undergo a phase transition at infinite N reflected by the eigenvalue distribution closing a gap in its spectrum when the defining smooth loop is dilated from a small size to a large one. If this large N phase transition belongs to a solvable universality class one might be able to calculate analytically the string tension in terms of the perturbative Lambda-parameter. This would be achieved by matching instanton results for small loops to the relevant large-N-universal function which, in turn, would be matched for large loops to an effective string theory. Similarities between our findings and known analytical results in two dimensional space-time indicate that the phase transitions we found only affect the eigenvalue distribution, but the traces of finite powers of the Wilson loop operators stay smooth under scaling.

40|$|This chapter explores some of {{the ways}} {{physical}} dimensions, such as length, mass and time, impact on the work of scientists and engineers. Two main themes are considered: dimensional analysis, which involves deriving algebraic expressions to relate quantities based on their dimensions; and dimensional rea-soning, a more general and often more subtle approach to problem solving. The method of dimensional analysis is discussed both in terms of its practical applica-tion (including the derivation of physical formulae, the planning of experiments, and the investigation of self-similar systems and scale models) and its conceptual contribution. The connection between dimensions and the fundamental concept of orthogonality is also described. In addition to these important uses of dimensions, it is argued that dimensional reasoning (using dimensionless comparisons to sim-plify models, the application of <b>dimensional</b> homogeneity to <b>check</b> for algebraic consistency, and the ‘mapping-out’ of solutions in terms of parameter space) forms the implicit foundation of nearly all theoretical work and plays {{a central role in the}} way scientists and engineers think about problems and communicate ideas...|$|R

In particular we determine explicitly the matrix U which connects the Killing spinors to the gravitinos in the KK ansatz, and the dependence of the 4 -index field strength on the scalars. This {{is the first time}} a complete nonlinear KK reduction on a nontrivial compact space has been explicitly given. We need a first order formulation for the 3 index tensor field A_ΛΠΣ in d= 11 to reproduce the 7 dimensional result. The concept of 'self-duality in odd dimensions' is thus shown to originate from first order formalism in higher dimensions. For the AdS-CFT correspondence, our results imply that one can use 7 d gauged supergravity (without further massive modes) to compute certain correlators in the d= 6 (0, 2) CFT at leading order in N.
