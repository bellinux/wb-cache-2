5|$|Swedish {{schoolchildren}} tell Bellman <b>jokes</b> about {{a person}} named Bellman, an antihero or modern-day trickster {{with little or no}} connection to the poet. The first known Bellman joke is in a book from 1835, which quoted a letter written in 1808 by a contemporary of Bellman. 19th century Bellman <b>jokes</b> were told by adults and focused on Bellman's life at court; they often related to sex. In the 20th century, the 'Bellman' character became generic, the <b>jokes</b> were told by schoolchildren, and often related to bodily functions. The <b>jokes</b> have been studied by anthropologists and psychologists since the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Among more {{negative}} reviews include Jason Hughes of TV Squad, who commented that several <b>jokes</b> in the episode did not work, {{such as the}} reveal that Krusty the Clown has been sleeping with Sideshow Mel's wife for several years, though he did enjoy {{most of the other}} <b>jokes</b> and applauded the development of Nelson's character.|$|E

5|$|Another Green Wing {{series of}} running <b>jokes</b> is about hair. One {{of the more}} notable was various cracks about Mac's untidy hair, with Sue lending him a hair tie and hair clips before he goes in for an interview. Another was the {{character}} Karen getting her hair trapped in a printer in the first episode. Mac was {{often referred to as}} a Ginger by the other characters. Guy's hair becomes gradually curlier as the series goes on and Rachel dyes her hair from blonde to brunette after the first series. Other recurring <b>jokes</b> include Boyce's practical <b>jokes,</b> the bizarre games played by the human resources staff and surgery scenes where Caroline, Guy and Mac mess around while performing operations.|$|E
5|$|Robin Pierson of The TV Critic {{gave the}} episode a mixed review, rating the episode a 67/100, calling {{it one of}} the most densely packed pilots on television. He {{mentioned}} that it was entertaining but said that there were many <b>jokes</b> that followed the quality does not win out over quantity saying. He compared Peter to Homer Simpson and he compared the show to The Simpsons and King of the Hill. He criticized the amount of unfunny <b>jokes</b> while he praised the surreal moments. At the end of his review he stated that Family Guy was a different kind of animated comedy which set out to do <b>jokes</b> that other cartoons couldn’t do, also mentioning that the show had promise to become really funny.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare wrote {{seventeen}} comedies {{that incorporate}} many techniques still used by performers and writers of comedy—such as <b>jokes,</b> puns, parody, wit, observational humor, or the unexpected effect of irony. One-liner <b>jokes</b> and satire {{are also used}} to comedic effect in literature. In farce, the comedy is a primary purpose.|$|E
5000|$|Expected {{response}} to a <b>joke</b> is laughter. The <b>joke</b> teller hopes the audience [...] "gets it" [...] and is entertained. This leads to the premise that a <b>joke</b> is actually an [...] "understanding test" [...] between individuals and groups. If the listeners do not get the <b>joke,</b> they are not understanding the two scripts which are contained in the narrative as they were intended. Or they do [...] "get it" [...] and don't laugh; it might be too obscene, too gross or too dumb for the current audience. A woman might respond differently to a <b>joke</b> told by a male colleague around the water cooler than she would to the same <b>joke</b> overheard in a women's lavatory. A <b>joke</b> involving toilet humour may be funnier told on the playground at elementary school than on a college campus. The same <b>joke</b> will elicit different responses in different settings. The punchline in the <b>joke</b> remains the same, however it {{is more or less}} appropriate depending on the current context.|$|R
5000|$|One more type of anti-humor {{is found}} in the <b>joke</b> [...] "No soap radio". The <b>joke</b> is meant to have no punch line. When someone tells the <b>joke,</b> it is most likely with their friends, and it is meant to confuse others who don't know that there isn't {{supposed}} to be a <b>joke.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In the beginning, Barney, Ted and Marshall are all {{laughing}} at a <b>joke</b> that Barney had just told them. When Lily arrives, Barney decides {{to tell her}} the dirty <b>joke,</b> despite Ted and Marshall objecting and calling the <b>joke</b> [...] "guy funny". The <b>joke</b> has an unrevealed punch line, with Ted telling his kids that the <b>joke</b> was the dirtiest he had ever heard and that he wasn't going to tell his kids the <b>joke.</b> Lily then gets up from the booth and walks away, with Ted saying that Lily avoided the group for four weeks.|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{religious}} references in the series, Nakamura stated she used only her personal knowledge and {{some aspects of}} modern society, such as yakuza and blogging, which were {{not intended to be}} critical but were added because they fit the story. Similarly, secondary characters were only introduced in the series if a chapter needed a new character to introduce a topic. The themes of the chapters were created before the situations and <b>jokes.</b> However, if Nakamura had a specific theme, she created several <b>jokes</b> and then connected them to form a story. When creating a simpler chapter as compared to the more elaborate, thematic ones, she wrote without worrying about creating <b>jokes</b> and situations in advance. With the help of her four assistants, on average she took between ten days and two weeks to make a complete chapter.|$|E

5|$|For the game's localization, {{the main}} focus {{was to keep the}} {{dialogue}} natural and accessible to Western players, while also staying true to the Japanese version. The Japanese version had several instances of puns or cultural <b>jokes,</b> which would not have worked if they had been translated literally. There were also places in the script where the development team would have liked to insert <b>jokes</b> in the localization, but thought that it may be inappropriate to do so since the joke was not in the Japanese version. The team found difficulties in getting the Western version's tone right, as they wanted to keep the localized text interesting, {{and at the same time}} avoid inconsistencies with the original version's tone.|$|E

5|$|In the DVD {{commentary}} for The Simpsons ninth season, writer Donick Cary {{stated that}} {{the inspiration for the}} idea of an episode about stand-up comedy came out of comedy festivals at the time. Executive producer Mike Scully said that the writers had difficulty getting Krusty's offensive bad <b>jokes</b> through the network censors. The stereotypical <b>jokes</b> were allowed because the writers convinced the network censors that viewers would understand it was simply emphasizing Krusty's dated comedic material.|$|E

5000|$|A {{story that}} ran {{for several weeks}} in the Sunday comics of Li'l Abner during 1967 {{concerned}} {{the creation of a}} <b>joke,</b> never actually revealed, that was so funny that anyone who heard it immediately died laughing. For safety reasons, government agents somehow decided to keep the <b>joke</b> hidden in the protective custody of Abner Yokum. Meanwhile, comedian Bob Hope learns of the existence of this [...] "Funniest <b>Joke</b> in the World", but not about its deadly effects, and decides that he wants to recite it on his next television show.

It turns out, however, that before Bob Hope obtained the <b>joke</b> from him, Abner had read the <b>joke,</b> not understood it, and substituted his own favourite <b>joke.</b> It is this <b>joke</b> that Bob Hope reads on the air, to no harmful effect whatsoever.|$|R
