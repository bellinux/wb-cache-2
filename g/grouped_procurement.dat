40|$|The {{shortage}} or {{excess of}} components at a logistics centre is a combined {{outcome of the}} component level forecast provided to the suppliers by the manufacturing company and the actual supply of the component received from the supplier. The demand planning group shares the forecast with <b>procurement</b> <b>group.</b> The <b>procurement</b> <b>group</b> plans the supply based on the forecast and inventory information.

40|$|Pharmaceutical {{expenditure}} rose by 16 % {{per annum}} in China {{during the past}} decade, and now represents 46 % of total healthcare expenditure. Initiatives to moderate growth include pricing regulations for pharmaceuticals and encouraging International Nonproprietary Name (INN) prescribing. However, there is limited monitoring of physician prescribing and current incentives encourage hospitals and physicians to profit from drug procurement. The objective was to assess changes in statin utilization and expenditure as additional generics are launched. Subsequently, compare results in China with findings among European countries to provide future guidance. We used observational retrospective study of statin utilization and procurement expenditure from 2004 to 2013 in two large teaching hospital groups. The results were that statin utilization rose 32 -fold in one hospital group and 54 -fold in the other. Expenditure also increased but to a lesser extent, i. e. from just over Renminbi ‘yuan’ (CNY) 0. 65 million in 2004 to CNY 15. 3 million in 2013 in one hospital group and from CNY 0. 49 to CNY 19. 3 million in the other. Atorvastatin (originator) was the most utilized statin. Utilization of each generic statin was typically low, e. g. 10 % in 2013 in one hospital <b>group.</b> <b>Procurement</b> prices fell over time, greatest for generic simvastatin (- 74 % to - 91 %) mirroring data from European countries. However, no increase in their prescribing was observed. In fact, {{a significant decrease in}} generic prescribing was seen in one hospital group between 2004 and 2013. There are considerable opportunities to improve prescribing efficiency in China based on European experience. However, current incentives encouraging hospitals and physicians to profit from drug procurement need to be addressed...|$|R

The second hypothesis supposes that the incumbents are afraid of not being re-elected. Therefore they strive for maximizing their personal profit from the office. Regression analysis is used for testing. Public procurements for buildings are tested separately from public procurements for goods and services.

40|$|This paper {{discussed}} {{the development of}} an integrated Orbiter Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) and Improved APU (IAPU) Flight Suuport Plan. The plan identifies hardware requirements for continued support of flight activities for the Space Shuttle Orbiter fleet. Each Orbiter vehicle has three APUs that provide power to the hydraulic system for flight control surface actuation, engine gimbaling, landing gear deployment, braking, and steering. The APUs contain hardware that has been found over the course of development and flight history to have operating time and on-vehicle exposure time limits. These APUs will be replaced by IAPUs with enhanced operating lives on a vehicle-by-vehicle basis during scheduled Orbiter modification periods. This Flight Support Plan is used by program management, engineering, logistics, contracts, and <b>procurement</b> <b>groups</b> to establish optimum use of available hardware and replacement quantities and delivery requirements for APUs until vehicle modifications and incorporation of IAPUs.

The moves came to no surprise to Wall Street analysts and franchisees, as they were expected due to reservations about Levin after his appointment by the outgoing management at Pillsbury. Grand Met's first major restructuring move was the dismantling of Burger Kings 50-year-old purchasing and distribution arm, Distron. Unhappy with the distribution group, the company originally thought to dispose of the division after the purchase but instead decided to reorganize it into two separate <b>groups,</b> one for <b>procurement</b> (Burger King Purchasing or BKP) and another for distribution (Burger King Distribution Services or BKDS).

To study the efficacy of optimal blood washout of the liver, three groups were compared including low-pressure perfusion with UW-CSS (12 mmHg, group A), which is the routine method in clinical practice, high-pressure perfusion with UW-CSS (100 mmHg, group B) and low-pressure perfusion with modified UW solution (12 mmHg, <b>group</b> C). After <b>procurement</b> all livers were preserved in original UW-CSS for 0, 24 or 48 h, followed by reperfusion in oxygenated Williams Medium E for 24 h at 37 degrees C. Histology results of livers procured in group A, showed good hepatocyte viability but also remaining erythrocytes. However, injury parameters were high and ATP concentrations were low. No functional differences were found. Group B, high pressure, and group C, modified UW-CSS, both showed better results. High-pressure washout is preferable since the warm ischemia time during procurement is short. We propose to use high-pressure UW-CSS perfusion for the initial blood washout of the donor liver instead of the usually used low-pressure washout...|$|R
