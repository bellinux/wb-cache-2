40|$|The European Union has {{proposed}} a <b>European</b> <b>Investigation</b> <b>Order</b> to facilitate the transfer of evidence between member states. Ryan has suggested that “[t]he creation of a European Community wherein persons, goods and capital could move freely between borders brought with it new opportunities for the free movement of crime”. This thesis sets about investigating how the European Union institutions legislating for the transfer of evidence may affect the criminal process in Ireland {{and in particular the}} right to a fair trial and protection of fundamental rights. The European Criminal Process is examined. The history of the criminal justice competency of the EU is detailed. The roles played by various European institutions in the criminal process are considered. Important principles such as mutual legal assistance and the stronger principle of mutual recognition are considered, as are human rights within the EU. Evidence exchange and in particular the <b>European</b> <b>Investigation</b> <b>Order</b> is considered. A chapter considers the rationale/demand for the creation of the EIO including looking at the objectives of the <b>European</b> <b>Investigation</b> <b>Order.</b> This chapter outlines the current procedures in place at an EU level and compares them against the proposed operation of the EIO. The Irish approach to the exclusion at trial of improperly obtained evidence is compared with that of other EU countries. The traditional modes of trial (inquisitorial and adversarial) are compared first. The exclusionary rule of evidence will be used to compare how numerous European jurisdictions deal with evidence which is improperly obtained. It is hoped {{that by the end of}} the thesis, the reader will have an understanding of the developing European criminal process and the new <b>European</b> <b>Investigation</b> <b>Order.</b> It is intended to consider whether or not the EIO would be suitable for adoption by Ireland. ...|$|E

The principle of mutual assistance and mutual recognition of judicial decisions and the <b>European</b> <b>Investigation</b> <b>Order</b> in criminal matters are the basic issues that the authors deal in this paper work. This issue is very important today because after May 2017, the <b>European</b> <b>Investigation</b> <b>Order</b> in criminal matters will be the only instrument for the recruitment and transfer of evidence between countries of the European Union.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the position of the defence in a criminal case under the Initiative for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council regarding the <b>European</b> <b>Investigation</b> <b>Order</b> in criminal matters of 29 April 2010. This proposal is under ongoing discussion at the European Union level and aims to increase efficiency in cross- border cooperation on obtaining evidence in criminal matters. Mutual recognition is the key word on which this cooperation is based. Any new evidence-gathering instrument must safeguard human rights, including the rights of the defence. This work concentrates particularly on the investigation measure of hearing a witness. In this regard, the relevant specific defence rights and their interpretation by the European Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Justice are revealed. Subsequently, the potential execution of the new instrument of a <b>European</b> <b>Investigation</b> <b>Order</b> is scrutinised in light of these observations. The results suggest concerns regarding the form and content of the current provisions of the Initiative from a defence perspective. Moreover, general counterbalancing measures are absent, rendering the new Proposal non-proportional to the aim it is willing to achieve. The principal conclusion is that alternative scenarios should be established in order to balance all the interests involved. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study we have {{examined}} the specific provisions for certain investigative measures that {{may be subject to}} a European investigation warrant in criminal matters provided for in Directive 2014 / 41 /EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 3, 2014 on the European criminal investigation order. Thus, we have examined each investigative measures provided in the European legal instrument through the national legislation of Romania, as in the terms of transposition of this legislative act into the Romanian law. The examination of the European legislative act allowed us to identify some dysfunctions in the settlement of some provisions, malfunctions which in the judicial practice of Member States’ competent institutions will cause numerous problems, both of interpretation and application. Among these we only highlight the lack of concrete provisions that oblige the judicial authorities of the countries involved in the issuance and execution of a <b>European</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>order</b> in criminal matters, to provide legal assistance to the persons who are conducting such procedures. In this context, we have formulated a series of critical opinions, complemented by appropriate de lege ferenda proposals, which may be useful to the European legislator from the perspective of amending and supplementing this legislative act. We have also stressed on the need of transposing the European legislative act into the Romanian law by adopting a special law and not by amending some provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code. The innovations in the paper refer to the examination of the investigative measures that can be arranged by issuing a <b>European</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>order</b> in criminal matters, formulating some critical opinions and appropriate de lege ferenda proposals. The paper can be useful to the academics, practitioners in the field, especially to the European legislator from the perspective of amending and supplementing the European legal instrument and also to the Romanian legislator that will have to transpose this legislative act into the national law...|$|E

40|$|Throughout {{this paper}} we have {{conducted}} a general examination of the principles under which it is regulated the newest form of European judicial assistance in criminal matters, namely, the <b>European</b> <b>Investigation</b> <b>Order</b> in criminal matters. The examination is focused in particular on the necessity and importance of establishing this new form of legal assistance in criminal matters between the Member States, given that it will override the order of freezing property or evidence in the European Union. When examining the general principles of this form of assistance we have noticed some imperfections of the European law, therefore we have formulated some critical opinions, supplemented by proposals of de lege ferenda. At the same time, given that up to May 22, 2017 the European legal instrument {{will have to be}} transposed into the Romanian law, we have formulated some proposals of de lege ferenda aiming at the improvement of Law no. 302 / 2004 on international judicial cooperation in criminal matters, republished, as amended and supplemented. The innovations of the work regard the examination of the general principles set out in the Preamble of the European legal instrument, the importance and the necessity for adopting this regulation, as well as formulating critical opinions supplemented by appropriate proposals de lege ferenda. The current study follows other works in the international and European judicial cooperation in criminal matters domain, published in some national and foreign publishing houses and in the volumes of international or national scientific conferences. The work can be useful to academics, practitioners in the field and to the Romanian legislator from the perspective of transposing the provisions into the national law of the European legal instrument...|$|E
40|$|Defence date: 15 June 2012 Examining Board: Professor Neil Walker, EUI / University of Edinburgh (Supervisor); Professor Marise Cremona, EUI; Professor Valsamis Mitsilegas, Queen Mary, University of London; Professor Kimmo Nuotio, University of Helsinki. This thesis shall {{contribute}} to European Criminal Procedure, a rapidly evolving area of EU policy that has attracted much attention, but {{has also been}} subject to criticism. The research will first identify and analyse the main rationales of this area. Since the Tampere European Council of 1999, mutual recognition {{has become the most}} fundamental concept of judicial cooperation in criminal matters and has experienced a steep career, having been adopted by Art. 82 TFEU. When the principle of mutual recognition was introduced, it was based on an analogy to the free movement of goods. This analogy has often been regarded as flawed. Moreover, {{there has always been a}} notion of mutual recognition in judicial cooperation as well. The study will show how these two factors have influenced the development of the area, and how policy concepts, such as the principle of mutual trust, have had a greater influence on the development of the law than any legal doctrine. The lack of a coherent approach to the area of judicial cooperation and the unsystematic combination of different legal orders have caused unforeseen frictions for the individual. These will be illustrated by an analysis of the law of transnational evidence-gathering according to the European Evidence Warrant and the proposed <b>European</b> <b>Investigation</b> <b>Order.</b> It will be shown that most of the problems result from the lack of a uniform allocation of jurisdiction and from an overly confined understanding of fundamental rights in the context of judicial cooperation. By analysing the nature and purpose of jurisdictional rules in a national and a European context, the thesis aims at uncovering the theoretic foundations on which a uniform allocation of jurisdiction could be built. Finally, the thesis analyses the role of fundamental rights in judicial cooperation. It will uncover the ineptness of a nation-state oriented interpretation of fundamental rights to adequately address the problems of mutual recognition and argue for a European understanding of transnational judicial rights...|$|E
40|$|Straipsnyje analizuojama proporcingumo testo Europos arešto orderio atveju specifika ir praktinės problemos Europos Sąjungos teisėje bei Lietuvos baudžiamajame procese, taip pat proporcingumo testo schema ir vertinimo kriterijai. European {{arrest warrant}} {{is the first}} and the most {{frequently}} used legal instrument in the European Union based on the mutual recognition principle. Framework decision 2002 / 584 /JHA marks the starting point {{in the development of a}} simplified EU wide system of cooperation in criminal matters. Successful functioning of EAW system (as well as the whole mutual recognition based system) is dependent on the level of mutual trust between the issuing and the executing member state. More than 10 years of EAW application in practice has shown that in a standard situation priority is more likely to be given to the mutual trust rather than to a proper safeguarding of human rights. This has led to numerous situations in various member states in which EAWs have been issued when it was clearly unnecessary and disproportionate. The recent developments of the EU criminal and criminal procedure law have clearly shown that an increased amount of attention is being paid to proper safeguarding of essential rights of a person who is being faced with criminal justice system. Since there are no unified standards to be equally applied throughout the EU there is a need for individual assessment of each situation in order to stay in compliance with basic human rights. Such an evaluation is exclusively important during the application of EAW since a person experiences the most restrictive coercive measures – usually, a detention. Proportionality test in the EAW procedure is the key which guarantees that the instrument will be applied in compliance with the essential human rights. However, the prevailing approach to this question is that the proportionality check can and must be done only during the issuing of EAW. The executing state is excluded from the evaluation of the proportionality. This article analyse the nature and specifics of the proportionality test identifies the stages of its application and suggests the criteria to be evaluated during the test. Authors support the idea that the proportionality check must be carried out not only during the issuing stage, but also during the execution of EAW. Such a perspective is based on the direction which is apparent in the recent EU legislation based on mutual recognition principle (mostly – Directive on the <b>European</b> <b>Investigation</b> <b>Order),</b> practical experience of several member states and developments of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice. The proportionality test, suggested by authors, includes a wide range of material and procedural criteria. The set of criteria to be evaluated differs depending on an individual case and its specific circumstances. Thorough proportionality check during the whole process of EAW application is an option which can increase the level of procedural safeguards of an individual until criminal procedure rules are unified in the EU...|$|E
