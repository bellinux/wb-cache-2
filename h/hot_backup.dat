2500|$|Each Galileo {{satellite}} has two master passive {{hydrogen maser}} atomic clocks and two secondary rubidium atomic clocks which {{are independent of}} one other. As precise and stable space-qualified atomic clocks are critical components to any satellite-navigation system, the employed quadruple redundancy keeps Galileo functioning when onboard atomic clocks fail in space. The onboard passive hydrogen maser clocks' precision is four times better than the onboard rubidium atomic clocks and estimated at 1 second per 3 million years (a timing error of a nanosecond or 1 billionth of a second (10âˆ’9 or 1/1,000,000,000 s) translates into a [...] positional error on Earth's surface), and will provide an accurate timing signal to allow a receiver to calculate {{the time that it}} takes the signal to reach it. The Galileo satellites are configured to run one hydrogen maser clock in primary mode and a rubidium clock as <b>hot</b> <b>backup.</b> Under normal conditions, the operating hydrogen maser clock produces the reference frequency from which the navigation signal is generated. Should the hydrogen maser encounter any problem, an instantaneous switchover to the rubidium clock would be performed. In case of a failure of the primary hydrogen maser the secondary hydrogen maser could be activated by the ground segment to take over within a period of days as part of the redundant system. A clock monitoring and control unit provides the interface between the four clocks and the navigation signal generator unit (NSU). It passes the signal from the active hydrogen master clock to the NSU and also ensures that the frequencies produced by the master clock and the active spare are in phase, so that the spare can take over instantly should the master clock fail. The NSU information is used to calculate the position of the receiver by trilaterating the difference in received signals from multiple satellites.|$|E

40|$|Operating system hangs, crashes, {{deadlocks}} or panics are {{system failures}} {{from which the}} only option for recovery is a reboot. A reboot regains control over the machine but discards all live application and OS state still present in system memory, while this state might be critical to users or clients of the system. Heavy-weight approaches to preserve such state across failures, e. g., process/VM checkpointing, <b>hot</b> <b>backups,</b> etc., are intrusive to failure-free execution and/or require dedicated machines. In this paper, we describe Backdoors (BD), a novel system architecture that enables applications to survive software failures that render the system unavailable (system hangs, OS crashes, etc.) using a light-weight state extraction mechanism. The architecture builds on two components: (i) a programmable NIC that enables access {{to the memory of}} a machine even when its processor is unavailable due to severe OS failures, and (ii) OS extensions that enable remote access to light-weight application and OS state. We have implemented a Backdoors prototype by modifying the FreeBSD kernel and using Myrinet NICs for remote access. We describe a case study in using Backdoors in cluster-based Internet services in which nodes mutually monitor their liveness and recover client sessions from failed nodes. ...|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 17 - 20, 1988 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaThe Data Transport Subsystem (DTS) is a core {{subsystem}} of SFOC {{which holds}} together the GIFs, TISes, DMDs, DTVs and other SFOC application subsystems {{allowing them to}} operate in a distributed LAN based workstation environment. DTS does this by providing two primary features. The first feature is transparent local and remote interprocess communication. The communications interface is identical between two application subsystem processes whether they're running in the same machine or different machines. The second feature is the Logical Name Server, which makes connections on a name basis without regard to location or network topology. With these two features SFOC becomes a distributed system. Processes within a subsystem can even be distributed to perform load leveling and enhance system performance. Distribution fosters the use of redundancy and <b>hot</b> <b>backups</b> by allowing nodes to serve multiple purposes. Distribution allows isolation of mission telemetry while providing shared use of a common database. It supports the SFOC goal of off-the-shelf hardware expansion and upgrade. DTS provides an open-close-send-receive model of interprocess communication. It offers three types of service: virtual circuit, datagram and broadcast. The virtual circuit service supplies a full duplex path between communication endpoints and guarantees data integrity. The datagram service allows many communications endpoints to send to one endpoint. This is useful for sending status to a central process. The broadcast service allows a process to send to many receiver endpoints. This {{can be used for}} continuous monitoring of telemetry streams by multiple processes...|$|R

40|$|Major {{corporations}} {{around the}} world have come to rely totally upon the essential information asset stored in their corporate databases and data warehouses. If the information is not available for any reason the business may grind to a halt, and if it stays unavailable for a protracted period, serious financial consequences may result. Making a data warehouse available is not easy. Corporate data warehouses range from one terabyte to ten terabytes or more, with the intention of giving users global access on a 24 x 365 basis. Data warehouses can take months to set up, yet can fail in seconds. And to react to changing business requirements the data warehouse will need to change in design, content and physical characteristics on a timely basis. This paper asks a few simple questions: â™¦ How can I ensure that my data warehouse is constantly available to its users? â™¦ What happens if the operating system, or disk, or database crashes? â€“ Or the site gets burned down? â™¦ How can I tune the system on the fly? â€“ In fact, how can I change the hardware configuration on the fly? â™¦ How can I spread the performance load across my global wide-area network? â™¦ How do I manage such an enormous amount of online and offline critical data? The paper describes the characteristics of data warehouses and how to make a data warehouse safe, available, perform well, and be manageable. The presentation will cover various means of taking <b>hot</b> <b>backups</b> of huge data warehouses and their business-timely restoration. The exploitation of local and wide-area network replication will be shown to improve performance and availability of global services. New clustering technology will be shown to enable a data warehouse to grow organically to meet the need, exploiting ever changing configurations of storage, clustered servers, Storage Area Networks (SAN) and Local/Wide Area Networks.

40|$|Design a {{computer}} network using {{two or more}} host servers that supports a virtual hosting environment. The importance of creating a successful datacenter is to allow a company to maintain data accessibility while keeping the data secure. One way of doing this is to have servers at multiple locations to insure that data isnâ€™t lost {{in case of a}} failure at one server location. The impact of a datacenter that supports a virtual hosting environment is to maximize hardware recourses, grants the ability to quickly stand up server services and increases availability during hardware failure due to software like VMotion. We start the project by deciding the type of server that best fits the needs of the project. The next step is figuring out which RAID configuration best fits the needs of the datacenter. Once the RAID configuration is decided the user needs to figure out how much storage is going to be required for the datacenter to do its job. Depending on the RAID configuration each hard drive will only be able to access a certain amount of it capacity. Once the host server is set up the administrator can create virtual hosts, vCPUs and virtual machines to implement different required server functions. We will use different VMware products like VMware workstation and VMotion to maximize the usage of the physical hardware. The goal of the project is to create a datacenter with multiple servers and allow for remote access. The datacenter must be able to implement new services and manage its resources to provide maximum functionality. The datacenter must also be able to support warm and <b>hot</b> <b>backups</b> in case of a hardware failure. Anticipated Results and Conclusions: We expect to have a working datacenter with multiple hosting servers. We will utilize virtual machines and physical servers to create a computing environment.

5000|$|Many {{computer}} systems that were produced after the Tandem NonStop platform relied on {{some form of}} redundancy (or <b>HOT</b> <b>backup)</b> and a [...] "failover" [...] scheme to continue running. On the Tandem NonStop, however, each CPU performs its own work and may contain a dormant [...] "backup" [...] process for another CPU. Each pair of CPUs, 0 and 1 for example, share hardware ownership of controllers and disk drives. The drives are not REDUNDANT. Writes to the disk pair are performed on both the primary and backup drives. Reads, however, take advantage of which head on which drive {{is closer to the}} information and choose that drive onto which to perform the read. For example if CPU 0 fails, then CPU 1 takes over ownership of a disk drive, providing continuous availability to that data. A primary process that is running may be given a backup process, which receives checkpoint information. If the primary process fails, through whatever reason, the backup process takes over, that backup process may spawn its own backup. This is what earned them the name NonStop, since application programs can be fault-tolerant. This makes them very attractive for their customers, because of their ability for continuous availability, or being NonStop. These systems are also known for handling very high numbers of transactions per second, which is very useful for banks and stock exchanges.|$|E

40|$|The Web is {{increasingly}} used for critical applications and services. This paper presents a mechanism, called CoRAL, that provides high {{reliability and availability}} for Web service. CoRAL is client-transparent and provides fault tolerance even for requests being processed {{at the time of}} server failure. CoRAL does not require deterministic servers and can thus handle dynamic content. The scheme is based on a <b>hot</b> standby <b>backup</b> server that actively replicates the TCP connection state and maintains logs of HTTP requests and replies. For dynamic content, the throughput of a server cluster is increased by distributing the primary and backup tasks among the servers. For static content, that is deterministic and readily generated, the overhead is reduced by avoiding explicit logging of replies to the backup. In the event of a primary server failure, active client connections fail over to a spare, where their processing continues seamlessly. Our implementation of CoRAL is based on a Linux kernel module and an Apache Web server module.
