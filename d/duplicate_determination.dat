In those samples {{with a high}} content of carbon monoxide, the agreement between the two methods could be improved, by taking into consideration the concentration of carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb), since this plays no part in oxygen transport. The calculated values of the oxygen-binding capacity varied widely, with mean values less than the theoretical figure of 1. 39 ml O 2 /g Hb. This difference was greater in those samples with a higher content of COHb. When the amount of haemoglobin combined with COHb was taken into consideration the mean corrected values approximated to the theoretical value of 1. 39, thus sup-porting this as the mean value for the oxygen-binding capacity of haemoglobin, although the large individual variability persisted.

METHODS: This is a prospective, international comparison study conducted in three European EDs. Consecutive patients with suspicion of bacterial infection were included. <b>Duplicate</b> <b>determination</b> of PCT was performed in capillary (fingertip) and venous whole blood (EDTA), and compared to the reference method. The diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by correlation and concordance analyses. RESULTS: Three hundred and three patients were included over a 6 -month period (60. 4 % male, median age 65. 2 years). The correlation between capillary or venous whole blood and the reference method was excellent: r 2 = 0. 96 and 0. 97, sensitivity 88. 1 % and 93. 0 %, specificity 96. 5 % and 96. 8 %, concordance 93 % and 95 %, respectively at a 0. 25 mug/L threshold.

40|$|In {{the past}} several years a number of methods have been {{developed}} for measuring corticosteroid levels in human plasma. De Moor et al. have used fluorescent technique to measure the free plasma 11 -OHCS in human plasma. The procedure described here is based on their method, but minor modifications were necessary before satisfactory results were obtained. Using a domestic inexpensive fluorometer, the exciting light was provided by a mercury lamp with a 436 mμ filter and a narrow band secondary filter of 530 mμ was also used. All the reagents, available in our, country, were used without any further preliminary purification. 4 ml plasma samples were needed for a valid determination, and it seems likely that specificity is improved when fluorescence is measured ten minutes after the addition of the reagent. It was demonstrated that the extraction with methylene chloride must be performed by gentle inversion, avoiding vigorous shaking. The reliability of the method has been assessed by criteria suggested by Brown et al. The estimates of precision and sensitivity are based on <b>duplicate</b> <b>determination.</b> The degree of precision compared with that obtained by de Moor et al., and the smallest measurable value which can be distinguished from zero was 1. 7 μg/dl, if duplicate samples were used.

40|$|Monitoring of {{testosterone}} replacement therapy requires a reliable method for testosterone measurement. Determination of salivary testosterone, which reflects the hormone's biologically active plasma fraction, is a superior technique for this purpose. The {{aim of the}} present study was to establish a new sensitive time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay for the accurate measurement {{of testosterone}} levels in saliva and to validate it by monitoring testosterone replacement therapy in eight hypogonadal men. A clinical phase I- study with the new ester testosterone buciclate was performed to search for new testosterone preparations to produce constant serum levels in the therapy of male hypogonadism. After two control examinations eight male patients with primary hypogonadism were randomly assigned to two treatment groups (n = 2 x 4) and given single doses of either 200 mg (group I) or 600 mg (group II) testosterone buciclate intramuscularly. Saliva and blood samples were obtained 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 days post injection and then weekly for three months. The time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay for salivary testosterone shows a detection limit of 16 pmol/l, an intra-assay CV of 8. 9 % (at a testosterone concentration of 302 pmol/l), an inter-assay CV of 8. 7 % (at a testosterone concentration of 305 pmol/l) and a good correlation with an established radioimmunsassay of r = 0. 89. The sample volume required by this method is only 180 mu l for extraction and <b>duplicate</b> <b>determination.</b> The assay procedure requires no more than three hours. In group I (200 mg) testosterone did not increase to normal levels either in saliva or in serum. However, in group II, androgen levels increased significantly and were maintained in the normal range for up to 12 weeks with maximal salivary testosterone levels of 303 +/- 18 pmol/l (mean+/-SE) and maximal testosterone levels of 13. 1 +/- 0. 9 nmol/l (mean+/-SE) in serum in study week 6 and 7. The time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay for salivary testosterone provides a useful tool for monitoring androgen status in men and women and is well suited for the follow-up of testosterone replacement therapy on an outpatient basis. The long-acting ester testosterone buciclate is a promising agent for substitution therapy of male hypogonadism and in combination with testosterone monitoring in saliva offers an interesting new perspective for male contraception. ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MSc Food Sc) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2003. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: This {{study shows}} the {{potential}} of near infrared spectroscopy for both qualitative and quantitative analyses of wine and brandy in the distilling industry. Wines intended for further processing by the distillation industry have to meet certain specifications to ensure an efficient and cost-effective distilling process with a suitable product yield. Certain compounds have, therefore, been recognised as significant quality parameters and through their regulation, a product of consistent quality can be ensured. These quality parameters include alcohol, total acid, volatile acid, total sulphur dioxide, total phenolics, reducing sugars and acetaldehyde concentrations and pH. The effective control of all these compounds in the wines prior to distillation, is critical to maintain the feasibility and efficiency of the process. Fourier transform near infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIRS) {{can be used as}} a rapid and accurate analytical method for the determination of alcohol concentrations in distilling and brandy base wine. The choice of path length for the liquid sampling cell is an important consideration. In this study, alcohol with its strong absorption of OH bands in the near infrared region was not significantly affected, but difference in path length showed a significant influence on the prediction of the volatile acid concentration in distilling wine. Very strong correlations were found between the spectral data and the alcohol concentration data in distilling wine (r = 0. 99, SEP = 0. 18 % v/v, RER = 30) and brandy base wine (r = 0. 92, SEP = 0. 18 % v/v, RER = 11. 1). Good predictions were obtained for the volatile acid content of brandy base wine (r = 0. 85, SEP = 0. 04 g. L- 1) but better accuracy could be obtained by incorporating a wider concentration range and more sensitive, although not the accepted reference methods, such as HPLC and GC, into the modelling. In contrast to the brandy base wine, the much cruder, turbid distilling wine (r = 0. 67, SEP = 0. 33 g. L- 1) yielded poor calibration results for volatile acid. FT-NIRS can also be used as a rapid screening method to measure the total acid content, pH and total phenol levels in brandy base wine samples. Satisfactory predictions were obtained for the total acid content (r = 0. 89, SECV = 0. 38 g. L- 1), pH (r = 0. 84, SEP = 0. 09) and total phenol levels (r = 0. 71, SEP = 16. 4 mq. L" GAE). The SEP of all the parameters compared well with the SEL and were within acceptable limits. The range of the concentration measurements were, however, very narrow and the accuracy of these models (measured as the ratio of the range to the standard error of prediction) were all below 10, indicating that modelling of these parameters in brandy base wine should be attempted with reference values covering a wider range. Poor correlations and predictions were obtained between the wine spectral data and the acetaldehyde (r = 0. 39, SECV = 1. 45 rnq. L"), residual sugar (r = 0. 58, SECV = 0. 49 mq. L") and total sulphur dioxide (r = 0. 35, SEP = 10. 9 mq. L") concentration data. The unique character of potstill distillates, originating from the grape cultivar, type and age of the oak casks, lends itself to the development and blending of different brandies. The process of blending and correcting the brandy is necessary to obtain a product and brand of established and recognised character. The brandy is generally divided into different classes prior to blending based on the degree of "smoothness" or "hardness" of the matured distillate as determined by a sensorial panel. The ideal would, however, be to replace this subjective evaluation method with a more objective approach, such as an instrumental method like NIRS. Near infrared spectroscopy showed potential to successfully discriminate and classify brandy samples in terms of their sensorial classification status. The near infrared spectra of unblended three-year old brandies were measured and discriminant analysis performed using the subjective sensory classification data of the brandy. SIMCA (soft independent modelling of class analogy) models were developed by calculating separate peA (principal component analysis) models for each of the classes for which qualitative analysis were required. An assessment of class membership of an unknown sample was made on the basis of the distance to the cluster centroid. Two types of NIRS instruments, a Fourier transform near infrared system and a diode array spectrophotometer were employed to examine the discriminatory abilities of NIRS. Excellent predictions (90. 9 %- 100 %) were obtained for the "smoothest" and "hardest" classes within the 2000 and 2001 seasons with FT-NIRS. For the diode array spectra reasonable classification data were obtained for all the classes within the 2000 and 2001 seasons, as well as an excellent classification rate (100 %) of the smoothest class in the 1999 season. Prediction results for class membership of the brandy samples from the three season's combined data did not deliver satisfactory discriminatory results. By applying NIRS and SIMCA, rapid and objective classification of brandy samples within seasonal context can be established to enhance the blending processes. Having accurate reference data in the calibration set is essential in near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The precision (usually decided by blind <b>duplicate</b> <b>determination)</b> of the reference data serves as the performance target for correlation-based near infrared analysis. The differences between reference values obtained from two independent laboratories and the Foss Winescan FT 120, which is also a predictive method, for the alcohol and volatile acid determinations in distilling wine and between two independent laboratories for the measurement of the total sulphur dioxide content, were investigated. ANOVA and post-hoc analysis (Bonferroni testing) revealed statistically significant differences (p<O. OS) between all three measurements for the volatile acid analysis. One laboratory differed significantly from the other two measurements in its measurement of the alcohol content in distilling wine. A paired t-test performed on the two laboratories' values obtained for total sulphur dioxide revealed statistically significant differences (p<O. OS) between the two sets of results. This study restated the importance of obtaining reliable reference data for calibration purposes to maintain the efficiency and accuracy and therefore the reputability of NIRS as an accurate and reliable analytical method. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Hierdie studie dui op die potensiaal van naby infrarooi spektroskopie (NIRS) vir beide die kwalitatiewe en kwantitatiewe analise van wyn en brandewyn in die distillasie industrie. Sekere spesifikasies word gestel waaraan wyn met voldoen voor dit verdere prosessering tydens distillasie kan ondergaan. Die regulering van wynkwaliteit is noodsaaklik om die distilleringsproses ekonomies volhoubaar te maak. Sekere komponente in die wyn het 'n direkte invloed op die kwaliteit van die eindproduk en word beskou as betekenisvolle parameters wat beheer moet word om 'n produk van konstante hoë kwaliteit te lewer. Hierdie parameters sluit alkohol, titreerbare suur- en vlugtige suurinhoud, asook die pH, totale swaweidioksied, totale fenol vlakke, reduserende suikers en asetaldehied konsentrasies in. Die regulering van al hierdie komponente in die wyne is essensieel voor die aanvang van distillasie om die effektiwiteit en produktiwiteit van die proses te verseker. Fourier transformasie naby-infrarooi spektroskopie (FT-NIRS) kan benut word as 'n vinnige en akkurate analitiese metode om die alkohol konsentrasie in stook- en rabatwyn te bepaal. 'n Geskikte padlengte kuvet moet gekies word vir die ontleding van vloeistof monsters met NIRS. In hierdie studie is gevind dat die voorspelling van alkoholkonsentrasie in wyn, nie soseer beïnvloed is deur die keuse van padlengte nie. 'n Vlugtige komponent soos asynsuur, wat die maatstaf van die vlugtige suurinhoud van die wyn is, word egter regstreeks beïnvloed deur die keuse van padlengte. 'n Sterk korrelasie is gevind in die datastel vir die alkoholinhoud van die stookwyn (r = 0. 99, SEP = 0. 18 % v/v, RER = 30) en rabatwyn (r = 0. 92, SECV = 0. 18 % v/v, RER = 11. 1). Baie goeie voorspellings is ook gevind vir die vlugtige suurinhoud van rabatwyn (r = 0. 85, SEP = 0. 04 g. L- 1). Die akkuraatheid van die metode (uitgedruk as die RER waarde) het egter aangedui dat 'n wyer konsentrasie omvang en meer akkurate verwysingswaardes gebruik moet word om 'n geskikte model vir vlugtige suur kwantifikasie in rabatwyn te bewerkstellig. In teenstelling met die resultate verkry vir die rabatwyn, het die ruwer, turbiede stookwyn swak gekalibreer vir die vlugtige suurinhoud (r = 0. 67, SEP = 0. 33 g. L- 1). FT-NIRS kan ook gebruik word as 'n vinnige seleksie metode om titreerbare suur vlakke, pH en totale fenolinhoud van rabatwyn monsters te bepaal. Sterk korrelasies is in die datastel gevind vir die titreerbare suurinhoud (r = 0. 89, SECV = 0. 38 g. L- 1), pH (r = 0. 84, SEP = 0. 09) en totale fenol vlakke (r = 0. 71, SEP = 16. 4 rnq. L" GAE) van rabatwyn. Die SEP waardes verkry vanaf die NIRS bepalings het baie goed vergelyk met die standaard foute wat verkry is vir die chemiese bepalings. Die konsentrasie omvang van die verwysingswaardes was, egter, beperk en die akkuraatheid van die NIRS modelle (uitgedruk as die verhouding tussen die konsentrasie omvang en die standaard fout van voorspelling) was laer as 10. Dit het daarop gedui dat die NIRS kalibrasie van die parameters eerder uitgevoer moet word met monsters wat 'n wyer konsentrasie omvang dek en gemeet is met meer sensitiewe analitiese metodes soos HPLC en GC. Die kalibrasie en voorspelling van die asetaldehied inhoud (r = 0. 39, SECV = 1. 45 rnq. L"), reduserende suiker konsentrasie (r = 0. 58, SECV = 0. 49 mq. L") en totale swaweldioksiedinhoud (r = 0. 35, SEP = 10. 9 rnq. L") het onaanvaarbare voorspellings gelewer. Die unieke karakter van potketel distillate wat bepaal word deur die druifkultivar, tipe en ouderdom van die eikehoutvate, bied die potensiaal vir die ontwikkeling en versnyding van verskillende style brandewyn. In 'n poging om 'n produk en handelsnaam van erkende en gevestigde karakter te verkry, moet die brandewyn eers versny word na veroudering. Die brandewyn word geklassifiseer in verskillende style op grond van sensoriese gehalte. NIRS is gebruik as 'n vinnige tegniek om te onderskei tussen verskillende style onversnyde drie jaar-oue brandewyn. SIMCA (soft independent modelling of class analogy) modelle is ontwerp deur aparte PCA (hoof komponent analise) modelle vir elke klas waarvoor kwalitatiewe analise vereis is, te ontwikkel. 'n Skating van klas lidmaatskap van 'n onbekende monster is gemaak deur die afstand van die monster na die groepsmiddelpunt te bereken. Twee soorte NIRS instrumente, 'n FT-NIR en 'n diode array spektrofotometer is gebruik tydens die studie om die diskrimineringsvermoë van elk te ondersoek. Uitstekende voorspellings (90. 9 %- 100 %) is gekry vir die "sagste" en "hardste" klasse binne die 2000 en 2001 seisoene met FTStellenbosch NIRS. Met die diode array spektra is redelike klassifikasie resultate verkry vir al die klasse binne die 2000 en 2001 seisoene, asook 'n uitstekende klassifikasie (100 %) vir die sagste klas binne die 1999 seisoen. Voorspellings vir klas lidmaatskap van die brandewyn monsters vir die drie seisoene se gekombineerde data het egter onaanvaarbare diskriminasie resultate gelewer. NIRS en SIMCA sal 'n vinnige en objektiewe klassifikasie proses van onversnyde brandewyn monsters kan meebring wat tot voordeel van die versnydings- en produksieproses sal wees. Hierdie voorspellings sal egter binne seisoensverband moet geskied. Akkurate verwysingsdata in die kalibrasie datastel is 'n essensiële fasset van naby infrarooi spektroskopie. Die presisie (bepaal deur blinde duplikaat bepalngs) van die verwysingsdata dien as 'n prestasie teiken vir korrelasie-gebaseerde naby infrarooi voorspellings. Die verskille tussen die data verkry vir die alkohol- en vlugtige suurinhoud van stookwyn deur twee onafhanklike laboratoriums en 'n instrumentele metode (Foss Winescan FT 120) asook die verskille tussen die data verkry van twee laboratoriums vir die totale swaweidioksied metings, is ondersoek. ANOVA en post-hoc toetse het aangedui dat al die data verkry vir die vlugtige suur bepalings, statisties betekenisvol van mekaar verskil het (p< 0. 05).

Quality assurance of the survey was implemented by <b>duplicate</b> <b>determinations</b> and analysis of standard reference materials. On average, bread contains 5. 47 mg/g of sodium and 2. 31 mg/g of potassium (N= 108). Raisin bread excluded, bread hardly differs in sodium content. Of 7 breads assayed, the sodium chloride content marginally violates the Dutch legal limit for bread of 2. 5 % on dry weight basis. Bread consumption contributes on average 24 - 35 % to the daily sodium intake; the corresponding figure for potassium is 9 - 13 %. Potassium levels of bread are type related with higher potassium levels for brown and rye bread than for white bread. With an average value of 3. 91 mg/g, raisin bread is highest in potassium content...|$|R
40|$|The {{accuracy}} and precision of Urograph, a commercial preparation of chromatography papers designed for the determination of urea nitrogen in plasma and serum, were assessed. Results of <b>duplicate</b> <b>determinations</b> were {{compared with those of}} two acceptable quantitative procedures, (1) automated diacetyl monoxime and (2) modified Van Slyke and Cullen analysis. Values for serum specimens obtained by Urograph were significantly higher than those found by the Autoanalyzer method. The confidence limits for the Urograph procedure ranged from 12. 5 % for plasma to 26. 6 % for sera, whereas the corresponding values were 6. 9 % and 7. 0 % for Autoanalyzer. This lack of precision with Urograph appeared to be due mainly to the presence of a few strips in which only partial migration occurred. The papers yielded low values following 81 / 2 months of storage in the refrigerator; the test was temperature-sensitive...|$|R
40|$|Blood was sampled {{from nine}} healthy {{subjects}} weekly for 10 weeks, under controlled conditions. Eighteen serum constituents were measured in duplicate in each sample {{on a single}} occasion. In this way analytic variation was minimized. Considerable variations in mean values and standard de-viations of results were observed among the subjects. Physiological control of serum calcium and magnesium concentrations appeared {{to be more precise}} than <b>duplicate</b> <b>determinations</b> in the laboratory. Compared with a previous study from this laboratory, significantly different estimates of personal variation were noted for sodium, chloride, urea nitrogen, choles-terol, and LDH in a group matched by age, race, and sex. At the same time, the present study group, homogenous with respect to these demographic factors (and also occupation) showed as great a diversity in the mean con-centrations of most constituents as was seen earlier in a larger, more heterogenous group of normal individuals. These findings indicate that certain blood parameters depend more on personal characteristics than o...|$|R
40|$|The {{extent of}} {{evolutionary}} conservation of DNA complimentary to RNA {{stored in the}} mature oocyte of the sea urchin has been assessed. To do this, such DNA was hybridized with total genomic DNA of and and the thermal stability of the resultant duplexes was measured by two methods. In the first method, the duplexes were bound to hydroxylapatite and thermally eluted; the difference in thermal stability between homologous and heterologous duplexes averaged 6. 9 [deg] C in <b>duplicate</b> <b>determinations.</b> In the second experiment, the same hybrids were thermally melted in 2. 4 M tetraethyl-ammonium chloride, then assayed with S 1 nuclease; the difference in thermal stability of homologous and heterologous duplexes was 4. 8 [deg] C. Either value is {{significantly lower than the}} divergence of total single-copy DNA among these species as measured by the same techniques. This demonstrates that DNA sequences complimentary to maternal RNA are conserved during evolution, and thus that a high fraction of them are likely to be physiologically functional...|$|R
40|$|A newly {{developed}} radioimmunoassay {{was used to}} measure the concentration of vancomycin in 137 specimens of serum from patients being treated with this antibiotic. Of these sera, 84 were also analyzed with a microbiological assay technique for vancomycin. <b>Duplicate</b> <b>determinations</b> were done with each of the techniques. Individual values and averaged values for both methods were used for statistical analyses. The correlation coefficients between all possible combinations of radioimmunoassay and microbiological assay results for the 84 sera were {{greater than or equal to}} 0. 99 (P less than 0. 01). Values for the regression coefficients of radioimmunoassay results on microbiological assay results ranged from 0. 98 +/- 0. 01 to 1. 03 +/- 0. 01. The mean percent deviation of radioimmunoassay versus microbiological assay results was - 1. 56 +/- 0. 60. A one-way analysis of variance demonstrated that the use of different standard curves for each batch of specimens assayed by microbiological assay did not significantly influence the results (P = 0. 07). The microbiological assay and the radioimmunoassay for measurement of serum vancomycin levels yielded essentially identical results...|$|R

The reproducibility of this method was established on a sample of 195 males with a test-retest correlation of 0. 993 and a standard error of measurement of 28 ml, and on a sample of 102 females with a correlation of 0. 987 and a standard error of measurement of 30 ml.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} different cooking methods (boiling and roasting) on the nutrients and anti-nutrients content of Moringa oleifera seeds. The Moringa oleifera seeds were collected from Enugu state, Nigeria. The grains were picked, washed, drained and divided into seven portions. The first portion was raw and it served as the control. The second, third and fourth portions were boiled at different time intervals. The remaining fifth, sixth and seventh portions were roasted at different time intervals. With the roasting and boiling temperatures kept constant, the different time set up was 10 min, 20 min and 30 min. The nutrient and the anti-nutrients determination were done using various standards. Mean and standard deviation of the <b>duplicate</b> <b>determinations</b> were calculated. The result showed that boiling and roasting increased the protein, fibre, vitamin A, iron and zinc content. The result also showed that cooking techniques (boiling and roasting) decreased the tannin level but increased the saponin, phytate and oxalate levels. Because of the nutritive values of this under-exploited food crops, nutrition education workshops should be conducted to enlighten mothers {{on how to improve}} infants and adult foods with appropriate cooking methods on Moringa olefeira seeds...|$|R
40|$|Assessment of the {{functional}} significance of coronary artery lesions during cardiac catheteri-zation has recently become possible by calculating coronary flow reserve from both myocardial contrast appearance time and density in the resting and hyperemic states determined from digitized coronary cineangiograms. However, the interobserver and intraobserver variabilities, {{as well as}} the short-, medium-, and long-term variabilities of the coronary flow reserve measurements, have to be established before this technique becomes an acceptable means of assessing the immediate and long-term functional results of revascularization procedures such as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Variability was defined as the mean difference and standard deviation of the difference between <b>duplicate</b> <b>determinations</b> of coronary flow reserve. The intraobserver variability (mean difference SD) in the measurement of coronary flow reserve was- 0. 01 + ± 0. 07. Interobserver variability by two observers was + 0. 08 0. 52.

40|$|Helium-permeability and {{porosity}} were determired at {{room temperature}} for specimens from a typical EGCR moderator-grade graphite block. Permeability, at a mean pressure of 2 atm, ranged from 26 to 200 (av. 86. 5) millidarcys. Permeability data indicated that turbalent flow was never obtained with helium in these tests and that helium permeating the moderator graphite at EGCR operating conditions (taken to be: 600 deg C; DELTA P, 10 lb/in. /sup 2 / per inch of graphite; mean P, 400 lb/in. /sup 2 /) was in the viscous flow region. Daroy's law and the reported constants are applicable for flow computations involving moderator graphite under these conditions. Porosity ranged from 20. 6 to 29. 4 % (av. 23. 8 %), and there was no correlation between porosity and pemaesbility variations. The large variations encountered were believed to reflect the nonuniformity of the specimens, since <b>duplicate</b> <b>determinations</b> showed excellent agreement. Permeabilfty did not change appreciably with direction of flow and did not vary consistently with respect to the extrusion or any other axis. Preparation of the specimens did not appear to introduce appreciable surface effects. (auth...|$|R
40|$|Since {{information}} on the mechanism of the renal elimination of free and conjugated morphine was not available, studies in the dog were initiated to provide such data. The effect of morphine on renal filtration rate and blood flow of the dog was reinvestigated using a procedure which minimized the depressor action of this drug. The latter precaution was desirable since the marked reduction of renal filtration rate and blood flow in the dog described previously as an effect of morphine (Handley and Keller, 1950) could have resulted from the generalized vasodepressor action of the drug administered intravenously. METHODS. E 8 limation of drug. Each sample of urine or plasma was analyzed in duplicate for each drug and the values averaged. If the <b>duplicate</b> <b>determinations</b> were not in close agreement, or if the results seemed out of line, the analyses were repeated until the results were constant.

40|$|Clinical {{interpretation}} {{of changes in}} serial measurements of patients' HbA 1 c ought {{to be based on}} the knowledge of pre-analytical, analytical and intra-individual sources of variation that affect the results. The detectable change in HbA 1 c percentage depends on total analytical error. Since we have previously evidenced major problems in the routine use of HPLC, we compared a highly automated glycohemoglobin assay with the reference HPLC to solve the problem. The within- and between-run coefficients of variations ranged from 0. 86 to 0. 93 %, and 2. 51 to 2. 12 %, respectively, for the HPLC, and from 1. 07 to 0. 95, and 1. 61 to 0. 99 % for the immunoturbidimetric assay. After HbA 1 c-assay calibration, the quality-control survey report of <b>duplicate</b> <b>determinations</b> performed on 20 consecutive days by both the HPLC and the immunologic method provided the expected mean values of control materials. The assay of 106 blood samples showed a minor yet significant bias of the immunoturbidimetric assay toward lower HbA 1 c. values (p 0. 0001), as previously observed, although the two determination series resulted significantly correlated (r= 0. 96,p= 0. 0001).
