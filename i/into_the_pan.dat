The shredded mushrooms and sliced vegetables are arranged between the tripe and meat.

25|$|Atwell often {{returned}} to her native Trinidad, and on one occasion she {{bought a house in}} Saint Augustine, a home she adored and later renamed Winvilla and which was later turned <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pan</b> Pipers Music School by one of her students, Louise McIntosh. In 1968 she had recorded Ivory and Steel, an album of standards and classics, with the Pan Am Jet North Stars Steel Orchestra (director/arranger Anthony Williams), and supported musical scholarships in the West Indies. In the early 1980s, Atwell's sense of loss following her husband's death made her consider returning to Trinidad to live, but she found the weather too hot.|$|E
2500|$|When a pin rolls back, {{the smaller}} {{diameter}} of the pin allows it to fall rearwards through the ball return wheel. As the pins are still moving from the shaking by the board, a pin will bounce around until it lands in a pocket in the pinwheel. It may be seated in the pinwheel head-first or base-first. [...] The wheel brings the pin {{to the top and}} drops it into a metal tray, called a [...] "turnaround pan", similar to what exists on the rear end of the AMF 82-30 unit's pin distributor arm. It's shaped somewhat like a scoop, with the lip of the scoop facing the bowler. The weight of the pin's body makes it drop <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pan</b> base-first, so that the pin's base is facing the bowler. From there a conveyor belt lifts the pin up, letting it slide into one of ten spots – nine around the periphery in groups of three spots each, and one in the center for the number-5 pin – in a rotating metal basket called the [...] "turret" [...] (located just above the deck) with only the deck itself, protected with the attached sheet metal [...] "deck shield", visible to the bowler as it descends to handle the pins. When a pin lands in an empty location in the turret, the turret rotates (or [...] "indexes") so that the next pin will land in the next empty location, with the 5-pin chute {{in the center of the}} turret being filled last. Once the turret is full, and the empty deck reaches the top of its travel, all ten pins are simultaneously dropped from the turret into the spotting chutes of the table, which lowers them onto the lane to set the new rack of pins on the pin deck.|$|E

5000|$|Salt is {{also made}} by the [...] "pan process" [...] using direct {{evaporation}} over fire. Large wrought-iron pans that were 24 ft wide, 100 ft long, and 12 in deep were used. <b>The</b> <b>pans</b> were divided <b>into</b> two sections by a loose partition, which allowed the brine to flow slowly from the rear to the front section. A second, smaller pan was set behind and slightly above the first, so that its contents could be siphoned <b>into</b> <b>the</b> front <b>pan.</b> Both were heated by flues from grates before <b>the</b> gases passed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> chimney. <b>The</b> <b>pans</b> were inclined and sloping wooden platforms, called drips, were joined to them on which the salt was drained. The brine was purified with milk of lime, {{the same as in}} the kettle process.|$|R
5000|$|One of the {{traditional}} methods of salt production in more temperate climates is using open pans. [...] In open-pan production, salt brine is heated in large, shallow open <b>pans.</b> <b>The</b> earliest examples of this date back to prehistoric times and <b>the</b> <b>pans</b> were made of either a type of ceramic called briquetage, or lead. Later examples were made from iron. This change coincided with a change from wood to coal {{for the purpose of}} heating the brine. Brine would be pumped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pans</b> and concentrated by the heat of the fire burning underneath. As crystals of salt formed, these would be raked out and more brine added.|$|R

50|$|The {{most obvious}} and {{dramatic}} human-induced modification at Rietvlei was the dredging {{of the entire}} north-west section between 1974 and 1976. Seawater was pumped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pans</b> to facilitate <b>the</b> operation and a vast area was dredged {{to a depth of}} 9 m. The ecological consequences were profound and irreversible. A sizable portion of Rietvlei's shallow ephemeral pans was changed into a permanent deep-water lake, which resulted in a total change in ecological character for this portion of the system.|$|R
50|$|Earliest {{examples}} of <b>pans</b> used in <b>the</b> solution mining of salt {{date back to}} prehistoric times and <b>the</b> <b>pans</b> were made of ceramics known as briquetage. Later examples were made from lead and then iron. The change from lead to iron coincided with a change from wood to coal {{for the purpose of}} heating the brine. Brine would be pumped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pans,</b> and concentrated by the heat of the fire burning underneath. As crystals of salt formed these would be raked out and more brine added. In warmer climates no additional heat would be supplied, the sun's heat being sufficient to evaporate off the brine.|$|R
50|$|By the 17th century <b>the</b> <b>pans</b> {{started to}} be made from iron, firstly in pans 7 ft by 8 ft. William Brownrigg writing in 1748 in his ‘Book of Common Salt’, shows a wood-cut {{of one of these}} salt-making <b>pans.</b> <b>The</b> change from lead to iron coincided with a change from wood to coal for the purpose of heating the brine. Gradually <b>the</b> <b>pans</b> {{increased}} in size Christoph Chrysel writing in 1773 in his ‘Remarkable and very useful Information about the present Salt Works and Salt pans in England’ noted salt pans that were40 ft wide and 27 ft long and 1 ft deep. Brine would be pumped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>pans,</b> and concentrated by the heat of the fire burning underneath. As crystals of salt formed these would be raked out and more brine added.|$|R

30|$|More {{sophisticated}} {{forms of}} performing source priority identification in an unaided manner {{need to be}} investigated. To further automate <b>the</b> <b>panning</b> technique, instrument identification and other feature extraction techniques could be employed to identify those channels with high priority. Better methods of eliminating microphone cross-talk noise need to be researched. Furthermore, in live sound situations, the sound engineer would have visual cues to aid in <b>panning.</b> For instance, <b>the</b> relative positions of the instruments on stage are often used to map sound sources in the stereo field. Video analysis techniques {{could be used to}} incorporate this <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>panning</b> constraints. Future subjective tests should include visual cues and be performed in real sound reinforcement conditions.|$|R

60|$|The {{half-breed}} here {{referred to}} a habit of the hunters, who carry several bullets in their mouths to facilitate loading while running at full speed. The method is simple.
