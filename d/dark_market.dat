Bitcoins {{and other forms of}} cryptocurrency used in <b>dark</b> <b>markets</b> are not clearly or legally classified in almost all parts of the world.

50|$|Since most darknet markets {{run through}} Tor, {{they can be}} found with {{relative}} ease on public domains. This means that their addresses can be found, as well as customer reviews and open forums pertaining to the drugs being sold on the market, all without incriminating any form of user. This kind of anonymity enables users {{on both sides of}} <b>dark</b> <b>markets</b> to escape the reaches of law enforcement. The result is that law enforcement adheres to a campaign of singling out individual markets and drug dealers to cut down supply. However, dealers and suppliers are able to stay one step ahead of law enforcement, who cannot keep up with the rapidly expanding and anonymous marketplaces of <b>dark</b> <b>markets.</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} non-point-of-sale cigarette marketing in Australia, {{one of the}} ‘‘darkest’ ’ {{markets in}} the world. Design: Analysis of 172 tobacco industry documents. Results: The tobacco industry has continued to market their products despite severe restrictions on legal marketing activity. They made careful plans to circumvent regulation well in advance. In preparation for bans, they chose and strengthened existing brands to enable their continued success in a <b>dark</b> <b>market</b> and prepared the consumer for bans by increasing their spending on below the line activities. Bans reduced the industry’s effectiveness and efficiency. After bans new brand launches stopped: instead key existing brands were strengthened via alterations to the product, line extensions, and stretching loopholes in the legislation as far as possible. In line with the general trend towards integrated marketing, a range of activities {{have been used in}} combination, including guerrilla marketing, advertising in imported international magazines, altering the pack, sponsorships, brand stretching, event promotions, lifestyle premiums, and the development of corporate websites. Conclusions: The tobacco industry acknowledges that marketing restrictions have an impact, validating their continued use in tobacco control.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} the retail environment in cigarette marketing in Australia, one of the ‘‘darkest’ ’ markets in the world. Design: Analysis of 172 tobacco industry documents; and articles and advertisements found by hand searching Australia’s three leading retail trade journals. Results: As Australian cigarette marketing was increasingly restricted, the retail environment became the primary communication vehicle for building cigarette brands. When retail marketing was restricted, the industry conceded only incrementally and under duress, and at times continues to break the law. The tobacco industry targets retailers via trade promotional expenditure, financial and practical assistance with point of sale marketing, alliance building, brand advertising, and distribution. Cigarette brand advertising in retail magazines are designed to build brand identities. Philip Morris and British American Tobacco are now competing to control distribution of all products to retailers, placing themselves at the heart of retail business. Conclusions: Cigarette companies prize retail marketing in Australia’s <b>dark</b> <b>market.</b> Stringent point of sale marketing restrictions should be included in any comprehensive tobacco control measures. Relationships between retailers and the industry will be more difficult to regulate. Retail press advertising and trad...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{document}} the Australian tobacco industry’s activities regarding youth smoking to support tobacco control. Method: 492 industry documents from {{primary and secondary}} websites were abstracted and analysed. Results: Australian legislation and rhetoric on youth and tobacco has changed dramatically over the last 50 years, from an unproblematic association of teenagers and smoking in the 1960 s, through the industry’s aggressive attacks and denials in the 1980 s, to the 1990 s, when industry became newly compliant with ‘‘societal expectations’ ’ and youth became a dominant bargaining issue in the industry’s public relations strategy. The industry’s current policy is to simultaneously blame others for underage smoking, frame the industry as socially responsible via voluntary marketing codes, youth access programmes, and school education, and market actively to young adults. Conclusions: The arbitrary distinction between 17 and 18 year olds is, particularly in Australia’s <b>dark</b> <b>market,</b> a liability for tobacco control and {{an opportunity for the}} industry, which is attempting to claim the high moral ground traditionally occupied by tobacco control on the youth issue.

40|$|Companies of {{all types}} are buying, selling, and {{licensing}} patents - not just one patent, but many patents bundled into large portfolios. A primary problem with these transactions is {{that the market is}} illiquid: parties cannot identify holders of relevant portfolios, they cannot agree on the value of the portfolio, and the specter of litigation taints every negotiation. This article presents a new way to improve market formation and integrity by proposing that patent portfolios be treated as securities. If patent portfolio transactions are treated like stock transactions, sellers steering clear of fraud laws may be forced to disclose information about patent value. This has some unexpected benefits for curbing high-volume demand letter type patent assertions. Furthermore, patent transactions previously consummated in 2 ̆ 2 <b>dark</b> <b>markets</b> 2 ̆ 2 might now be traded in public clearinghouses.

40|$|D. Phil. The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the psychosocial factors which impact on smoking {{behaviour}} and to consider the impact of these factors on the formulation of national policy, as well as business and management practices around the marketing and promotion of tobacco products. An analytic induction approach was followed in analysing the data of multiple cases. Interviews and observations were used to gather in-depth information on nine participants (smokers, ex-smokers, social smokers and non-smokers). The data was subjected to analytic induction in order to build a typology of smoking behaviour. This theoretical tool was compared to current knowledge and culminated in a model of psychosocial factors that influence smoking behaviour, which was tested against a further four cases. No negative cases were found. The outcome of this study suggests that promoters of tobacco products should follow a more focused approach towards <b>dark</b> <b>marketing.</b> It also highlights that government and other anti-smoking agencies are not always effective in reducing smoking and counteracting covert marketing practices. The study also illustrated that analytic induction can be applied successfully in consumer behaviour studies.

40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been {{widespread}} concern {{over the growth of}} new &# 145;dark&# 146; trading venues in equity markets. It is important to understand the implications of these changes for market quality and the impact of different trading rules, in respect of dark pools, on the relative competitive positions of trading venues. Compared to exchange trading, dark venues are characterised by pre-trade opacity, exemptions from fair access requirements and the frequent use of sub-penny pricing. This dissertation shows that these unique features influence the ability of new and existing trading venues to compete for order flow and may have long term consequences for market quality. First, I investigate the role of sub-penny pricing in the competition for order flow between venues that differ on the basis of tick size regimes. I find that order flow migrates to dark venues offering sub-penny pricing when prices are constrained by the minimum 0. 01 USD tick size on the exchange. The implication of the finding is that larger minimum tick sizes generally put trading venues at a competitive disadvantage notwithstanding the benefits of discouraging free-riding. Second, I show that dark venues may use their unique features to attract uninformed clients, resulting in a segregation of informed and uninformed order flow. As a result, <b>dark</b> <b>market</b> fragmentation is associated with lower market quality, evidenced by higher transaction costs and lower price efficiency. However, the execution of large transactions on dark venues does not harm market quality. Third, I test whether non-displayed limit order books are more attractive to informed traders than crossing networks that cross only at the midpoint because traders can use discretionary pricing to reduce non-execution risk. The results show that trades executed at non-discretionary prices are more informed than trades executed at the midpoint of the National Best Bid and Offer. This dissertation contributes to the long-standing debate on market fragmentation versus market consolidation. The results also have policy implications for market regulators, who are required by their published mandates to assure themselves before approving market design changes that the changes enhance market quality, taking account of both market efficiency and market integrity...|$|E

40|$|In {{a growing}} number of {{countries}} tobacco companies are severely restricted in how they can legally market their products. In these 'dark' markets the role of packaging as a promotional and communications tool becomes more pronounced. How packaging is used for the most expensive cigarette brands in <b>dark</b> <b>markets</b> has received limited attention however, even though these 'premium' cigarette brands significantly impact upon the profitability of tobacco companies. We outline, using retail trade press journals, how packaging was used for premium brand 'Silk Cut' in the UK from 2004 to 2011, following a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising, promotions and sponsorship. From 2004 to 2008 packaging was used to help launch two new variants and during this period Silk Cut market share of the premium sector grew by 1. 1 %. Overall share of the cigarette market for the Silk Cut house (brand family) fell however due to the continuing decline of the premium sector. From 2008 to 2011 changes to the packaging were much more frequent, including the repeated use of limited-edition designs, and modifications to pack shape, texture, style of opening, cellophane, foil and inner frame. Silk Cut's share of the premium sector grew a further 2. 9 % from 2008 to 2011, and overall cigarette market share increased. That a premium brand can report any level of growth within such a hostile market, where most advertising, promotion and sponsorship is banned, taxation is {{among the highest in the}} world, and in the midst of a recession, is testament to the value of packaging...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} ASICs minimum price improvement rule implementation on dark trading and {{the impact on the}} efficiency of Australians pre-trade transparent market for ASX listed cash equities. ASIC implemented meaningful price improvement a regulatory market design change on 26 May 2013 forcing dark-venue trades to offer at-least-one-tick-improvement on prevailing-NBBO-quote. Pre-trade transparent (lit <b>market)</b> and <b>dark</b> <b>markets</b> differ based on their regulatory structures. Lit markets offer pre-trade transparency and fair-access whilst dark venues are pre-trade transparency exempt, and do not offer full and fair access to their order book. I construct a 2 SLS framework to model determinants of dark trading and use dark trading as an instrument to examine its effect and impact on market efficiency and market liquidity ex ante and ex post ASICs exogenous regulatory event. I find evidence of a decrease in asymmetric information ex post rule implementation and present evidence of decreased round trip costs of execution within the lit market after ASIC implemented meaningful price improvement. I argue the decrease in transaction costs not only evidence the rules positive effect on motivating liquidity providers to transact on the informed lit-market by influencing both informed and uninformed order flow to be less segmented, but also evidences improved market efficiency and market liquidity conditions of the Australian cash equities market. My results findings inform public debate as market operators and regulators around the world continue to expend significant financial, process, systems and people resources in an attempt to enhance market efficiency as well as identify, detect, investigate and prosecute market manipulation. Regulators will continue to be called upon to make regulatory market design changes or maintain current regulation; whichever best achieves the regulators goals of increasing market efficiency, market integrity and systemic risk...|$|R
