40|$|Numerous long-span bridges {{have been}} built {{throughout}} the world in recent years. These bridges are progressively damaged by continuous usage throughout their long service life. The failure of local structural components is detrimental {{to the performance of}} the entire bridge, furthermore, detecting the local abnormality at an early stage is difficult. This paper explores a novel damage detection method for long-span bridges by incorporating stress influence lines (SILs) in control charts, and validates the efficacy of the method through a case study of the Tsing Ma Suspension Bridge. Damage indices based on SILs are subsequently proposed and applied to <b>hypothetical</b> <b>damage</b> scenarios in which one or two critical bridge components are subjected to severe damage. The comparison study suggests that the first-order difference of SIL change is an accurate indicator for location of the damage. To some extent, different levels of damage can be quantified by using SILs incorporating with X-bar control chart. Results {{of this study indicate that}} the proposed SIL-based method offers a promising technique for damage detection in long-span bridges. ? 2014 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E
40|$|Large {{carnivores}} fascinate {{people because}} of their beauty and potential as human predators and have therefore become focal species for the ecotourism industry. Wildlife tourism has grown exponentially and has often {{been used as a}} financial argument for species conservation. However, carnivores depredate livestock, leading to a direct economic conflict with rural livelihoods, often resulting in lethal retaliation action. Here we show that jaguar ecotourism represents a gross annual income of US$ 6, 827, 392 in land-use revenue across a representative portion the Brazilian Pantanal, the world's largest wetland. Considering the aggregate costs of jaguar depredation on livestock within the same area, we estimate that the resident jaguar population would induce a <b>hypothetical</b> <b>damage</b> of only US$ 121, 500 per year in bovine cattle losses. This large discrepancy between economic gains and losses reinforces the importance of wildlife tourism as a conservation tool in boosting tolerance of jaguars in private ranches. We also evaluate the partnership between ecotourism and cattle ranchers, in which cattle losses induced by jaguars could be compensated by a system of voluntary donations from tourists, ensuring that both traditional livestock husbandry and ecotourism can co-exist within the same ranches, thereby promoting landscape-scale jaguar conservation...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{those factors}} {{critical}} to predicting public response {{is crucial to}} our ability to model {{the consequences of a}} terrorist strike in an urban area. Sixteen <b>hypothetical</b> <b>damage</b> scenarios were systematically varied according to non-terrorism vs. terrorism, explosions vs. infectious disease releases, terrorists ’ motives as demands to release prisoners vs. solely to instill fear, non-terrorists ’ motives as non-intentional vs. intentional (criminal), victims as government officials vs. tourists, non-terrorist incidents as involving no negligence vs. negligence, terrorist acts as non-suicidal vs. suicidal, and number of casualties (0, 15, 495). The setting was a local theme park. Students at a university in San Diego County were randomly assigned to different scenario conditions. For these scenarios, they were asked to address a number of questions regarding their perceptions and likely behaviors during and following an accident or terrorist strike. Results from regression modeling and Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) indicated that terrorism and the mechanism used were most influential followed by the presence of suicide or negligence, motive, and victim. Number of casualties made little difference once these other factors were accounted for. To forecast community response, a system dynamics model was introduced that incorporated the study’s survey findings. This model simulated the immediate and mid-term diffusio...|$|E

However, the term has a broader rhetorical definition; in political debates, [...] "frivolous" [...] is also used to describe tort lawsuits where there is only a remote link between the conduct of the defendant and the injuries alleged by the plaintiff or where the damages sought by the injured plaintiff are perceived to be too high for the injuries sustained. Tort reform advocates also complain about lawsuits that are brought based on purely <b>hypothetical</b> <b>damages</b> where the plaintiffs have suffered no tangible harm whatsoever, or where the harm caused could be traced to elements of excessive negligence or irresponsibility {{on the part of the}} claimant. Real or fictional frivolous lawsuits are a popular target of American humor.

40|$|The project {{contributes}} to the improved evaluation of the mechanical integrity of the soviet-type VVER- 440 reactors especially, to a sensitive early failure detection and to the localization of mechanical damages of reactor components by means of vibration monitoring. For that purpose the mechanical vibration of all primary circuit components was modelled by finite elements. Modeling {{was built on the}} finite element code ANSYS. The interaction between the coolant flowing in the downcomer and the vibrating components has been considered by a fluid-structure element, which describes additional mode selective damping and intertia due to the coolant displacement when the downcomer geometry changes. The calculation model was adjusted using results from experimental vibration investigations. To some extent data from earlier measurements were available. But additionally dedicated experiments had to be performed at original VVERs. Now, the model can be regarded to be widely verified. Mainly it was applied to clarify how <b>hypothetical</b> <b>damages</b> of reactor internals influence the vibration signature of the primary circuit. Such kind of damage simulation is an appropriate means to find sensitive measuring positiones for on-line monitoring and to define physically based threshold values. In principle, the model is even suited to estimate the loads of reactor components which might be imposed by external events (explosion, earthquake) ...|$|R

40|$|Numerous long-span cable-supported bridges {{have been}} built {{throughout}} the world in recent years. These bridges begin to deteriorate once built and continuously accumulate damage during their long service life. The growing popularity of comprehensive structural health monitoring systems (SHMSs) in recently built long-span bridges has started a new trend of integrating SHMS and damage detection technology for real-time condition assessment of these bridges. This paper explores a novel damage detection technique based on stress influence lines (SILs) of bridge components and validates {{the efficacy of the}} technique through a case study of the Tsing Masuspension bridge. A mathematical regularization method is first introduced to identify SILs based on the in situ measurement of train information and train-induced stress responses in local bridge components. Good agreement between the identified and baseline SILs demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed identification method. Damage indexes based on SILs are subsequently proposed and applied to <b>hypothetical</b> <b>damage</b> scenarios in which one or two critical bridge components are subjected to severe damage. The comparison suggests that the first-order difference of SIL change is an accurate indicator of the damage location. Results {{of this study indicate that}} the proposed SIL-based method offers a promising real-time technique for damage localization in long-span cable-supported bridges equipped with comprehensive SHMSs.

It is alleged that then-Colorado governor Bill Owens considered authorizing the National Guard to utilize either an AH-64 Apache attack helicopter equipped with a AGM-114 Hellfire missile or a two-man fire team equipped with a FGM-148 Javelin anti tank missile to destroy the bulldozer, and that the option was later deemed unnecessary due to Heemeyer getting stuck in the Gambles hardware store.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effects of electroconvulsive shocks on gestation and maternal behavior in the multiparous rat. In a recent study, Rosvold (13, 14) investigated the effects of electroconvulsive shocks on gestation and maternal behavior in the nulliparous white rat raised in the Stanford laboratory. It was shown that electroconvulsive shocks disrupt pregnancy and interfere with such components of maternal behavior as nest building, parturition, lactation, cleaning of the young, retrieving and maintenance of the nest. Further, the seriousness of the effect seemed to be related to the period of pregnancy - lactation cycle during which the shocks were administered. His results also indicated a rise in the body temperature of the animal during the period in which the shocks were administered. He concluded that the effects of electroccnvulsive shock on pregnancy and maternal behavior appeared to be greater than could be accounted for by known or <b>hypothetical</b> cortical <b>damage.</b> Hormonial dysfunction as a result of the shock was suggested as a basis for explaining the results.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} advances {{the current}} state-of-the-art {{with respect to}} fatigue fracture in the marine industry by considering three interrelated issues in concert. The first involves the time-dependent nature of the fatigue inducing loads which, given a linear damage hypothesis, is typically a mute point. Intuitively, however, {{the order of the}} loading does matter and extreme overloads are not randomly dispersed throughout, but clustered together during physical storms. Therefore, the present work addresses the simulation of long, time-dependent (storm model) stress sequences which are stationary at one timescale (i. e., on the order of hours), yet decidedly non-stationary over longer intervals. Two categories of nonlinearities are simultaneously addressed. They are considered to arise from nonlinear ship motions and responses, and from the conversion of the resultant structural loading to equivalent fatigue damage and/or crack growth. In the present work, the former is taken to include the contribution of nonlinear wave-induced bending and whipping responses, whereas the latter encompasses the material hysteresis or load interactions inherent to variable amplitude loading. In accounting for this material hysteresis, focus is shifted from a <b>hypothetical</b> fatigue <b>damage</b> criterion (i. e., applicable to the crack initiation and early crack growth phases), to macroscopic fatigue crack growth behavior {{within the context of a}} damage tolerant design. By considering the time-dependent nature of the fatigue inducing loads, a novel modeling approach is proposed which extends the finite element analysis of plasticity-induced crack closure to variable amplitude, high-cycle fatigue predictions. In doing so, cycle-by-cycle material hysteresis is included through a time-dependent crack opening level. This approach is demonstrated to be both consistent and convergent and, in contrast to previous numerical studies, permits the incorporation of a material constitutive model suited to cyclic plasticity in structural steels. Implementing this model within the context of storm model loading, several aspects of the fatigue fracture process are explored. Elucidated behaviors include the influence of nonlinear ship responses, the significance of physical storms, and the random nature of the fatigue process over a finite interval of ship operation...|$|R
40|$|Tissue injury {{leads to}} the {{disruption}} of cellular membrane integrity and loss of cytoplasmic components into the extracellular space. Myocardial damage results in elevated levels of cytosolic and structural proteins belonging to injured cells such as the wider expressed aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or the cardiac specific Troponin I (cTnI). In this study, we tested a human cTnI diagnostic kit developed by Siemens for cross-reactions with cultured cardiomyocytes (CMs) and heart tissues derived from several animal species. cTnI structure is highly conserved across species and the assays validated for human cTnI can represent a valuable tool to estimate cardiac suffering in animals. We collected post-mortem cardiac tissue and we tested the cross reactivity of anti-cTnI antibodies in animal heart homogenates. As expected, homogenates collected from mammals showed a robust cross-reactivity with human cTnI immunoassay. In order to reproduce in vitro a cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRJ) model using murine cells, we improved a CM isolation protocol starting from neonatal mouse hearts that results in primary culture of cardiac fibroblasts and CMs. Using human diagnostic laboratory kits {{we were able to}} detect murine AST by an enzymatic activity assay as well as murine cTnI by a sandwich immunoassay based on luminescent oxygen channeling (LOCI™) technology. Indeed, we confirmed the specificity of cTnI dosage for CMs, at variance with AST that recognize also fibroblasts, {{and we were able to}} correlate cTnI amount with CM number. Next, CMs were challenged in extreme cultural conditions such as hypoxia and reoxygenation and both these events will cause CM damage. Similarly to the evaluation of cardiac markers in circulating blood, released cTnI was directly estimated in culture supernatants. In conclusion we confirm the specificity and the sensitivity of cTnI quantification in identifying not only human but also mammalian CMs and we suggest the use of a high sensitivity cross-reactive diagnostic kit for an accurate evaluation. We are convinced that this finding will surely help in assessing <b>hypothetical</b> myocardial <b>damage</b> in mammals and in cellular cardiovascular-related models...|$|R
40|$|The {{liability}} regime for erroneous signals provided from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) is a topical issue. There is already certain legal analysis relating to this matter which suggests {{the adoption of}} an international convention which would subject GNSS operators to a strict {{liability regime}} with a limitation on the amount and furthermore supplemented by a compensation fund. This paper will try to address the issues of liability for erroneous GNSS signals from a different perspective, namely that of product liability. Interestingly, someone could argue that {{in case of an}} erroneous GNSS signal, the GNSS provider could be considered liable for defective product, if the GNSS signal were qualified as a product. In some legal systems, this would lead to strict liability of the provider. In order to reach such a conclusion, it would be necessary to qualify the GNSS signal as a product. Thus, a number of particular questions need to be further explored: First, would the concept of product liability be relevant for GNSS activities? Furthermore, can a satellite signal be qualified as a product or as a service? What would be the legal consequences for GNSS signal providers if satellite signals were qualified as products? The basic aim {{of this paper is to}} give answers to the aforementioned questions. In doing so, the paper will base its analysis on two GNSS systems; the current system of GPS and the forthcoming system of Galileo. After briefly describing the basic elements of these systems and some <b>hypothetical</b> scenarios of <b>damage,</b> the paper will address the issue of whether satellite signals could be considered as products or services. In doing so, analogies from other fields as for instance electricity or defective information stemming from aeronautical charts, will be drawn. Electricity has been recognized as a product in a number of legal systems, within the EU for example. Defective information stemming from aeronautical charts has been qualified as a product by some American Courts. Given the fact that satellite signals share a number of common characteristics with electricity as well as with information derived from aeronautical charts, by analogy, one could reach the conclusion that satellite signals might be qualified as products. In addition, the legal consequences of recognizing satellite signals as a product will be examined by reviewing product liability provisions in selected legal systems, namely the USA and the EU. Finally, some conclusions will be drawn from the aforementioned analysis...|$|R
