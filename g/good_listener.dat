25|$|Michael Parkinson always sought guests who, {{besides being}} well known, {{had some sort}} of story to relate. He then saw his job as {{allowing}} them to tell it and did so by being open, relaxed and attentive. (He learnt very early on that in order to be an adept interviewer, he had to be a <b>good</b> <b>listener.)</b> He researched his subjects thoroughly, and, in the early shows, always had his list of questions to hand. Having guided them to an area of discussion, he rarely interrupted his guests — except to provide the occasional prompt — instead letting them expand on a particular topic. Sometimes, a person would warm to this style with unpredictable results. For example, he regards his chats with Shirley MacLaine as bordering on flirtatious. In his final programme, broadcast 22 December 2007, Parkinson stated that one of his most memorable interviews was with Jacob Bronowski in 1973.|$|E
25|$|When he was 11 years old, Plenty Coups had {{a second}} vision {{involving}} the Little People, one that changed the fate of his entire tribe. Plenty Coups' family had moved to be with other bands of Crow lodging in the Beartooth Mountains. All the young men were challenged {{to go into the}} hills to seek visions, and Plenty Coups did so. Plenty Coups walked for two days (fasting as he went) and entered the Crazy Mountains, but had no vision. He returned a few days later with three friends, fasted, and took sweat-baths. He decided to cut off the tip of his left index finger as an offering to the spirits. That night, he dreamt of the chief of the Little People again. The chief introduced Plenty Coups to a buffalo that turned into a man with buffalo-like features (the buffalo-man), who led him underground and down a tunnel or path toward the Pryor Mountains. For two days, he traveled underground among throngs of American bison. Finally, the buffalo-man showed Plenty Coups a vision of endless streams of bison coming out of {{a hole in the ground}} but disappearing. Then a second stream of bison—with different colors (even spots), tails, and sounds—came up out of the ground, and remained on the plains. Plenty Coups had a vision of himself as an old man lodged near the Medicine Rocks, and of a vast forest whose trees had been felled by a great wind. Only a chickadee remained. A voice told Plenty Coups that the day of the Plains Indian was ending, and that white men would swarm over the land like buffalo. But the chickadee remains, because it is a <b>good</b> <b>listener,</b> develops its mind, and survives by its wits.|$|E
500|$|According to Walker, {{the power}} of words is another theme that appears {{repeatedly}} in Caged Bird. For example, Maya chooses to not speak after her rape because she is afraid of the destructive power of words. Mrs. Flowers, by introducing her to classic literature and poetry, teaches her about the positive power of language and empowers Maya to speak again. [...] The importance of both the spoken and written word also appears repeatedly in Caged Bird and in all of Angelou's autobiographies. Referring {{to the importance of}} literacy and methods of effective writing, Angelou once advised Oprah Winfrey in an 1993 interview to [...] "do as West Africans do... listen to the deep talk", or the [...] "utterances existing beneath the obvious". McPherson says, [...] "If there is one stable element in Angelou's youth it is [...] dependence upon books". The public library is a [...] "quiet refuge" [...] to which Maya retreats when she experiences crisis. Hagen describes Angelou as a [...] "natural story-teller", which [...] "reflect a <b>good</b> <b>listener</b> with a rich oral heritage". Hagen also insists that Angelou's years of muteness provided her with this skill.|$|E

40|$|Ankara : The Institute of Economics and Social Sciences of Bilkent University, 1991. Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 1991. Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 68 - 69. Listening comprehension {{is viewed}} as an active process in which individuals focus on selected aspects of aural input, construct meaning from passages, and relate what they hear to existing knowledge. This theoretical view has not been sufficiently supported by empirical research which clarifies what the listeners actually do when they engage in a listening task. The mental processes that take place during an aural input are known as listening comprehension strategies. This study focused on listening comprehension strategies of EFL learners in a foreign environment. The differences in strategy usage between <b>good</b> and poor <b>listeners</b> were investigated. The {{subjects in this study}} were all from Turkish backgrounds, intermediate in English proficiency, university graduates from different majors. They were enrolled in prep classes at Karadeniz Technical University, Trabzon, in order to reach a sufficient level of proficiency {{to be able to use}} English references for their academic needs. Data were collected through an interview guide which included questions asked to the subjects during individual interview sessions. Findings indicated that <b>good</b> <b>listeners</b> and poor listeners engaged in different mental processes during the listening activities. The main strategy types that differentiated <b>good</b> <b>listeners</b> from poor listeners were self reinforcement, elaboration, transfer, contextualization, resourcing, and questioning for clarification. Translation was found the most predominant strategy type employed by poor listeners, whereas it was used infrequently by <b>good</b> <b>listeners.</b> Cinemre, YaşarM. S...|$|R
50|$|Effective {{listening}} {{is crucial}} to proper communication in everyday life. However, active listening is not a natural process. In fact, even people who consider themselves <b>good</b> <b>listeners</b> often only listen with 25% efficiency. Active listening involves attentive body language, restating comments and emotions of the speaker, and repeating their ideas back in order to check comprehension accuracy.|$|R

For the past 37 years Ayatollah Sistani has lived in the same modest rented house. Although he is well renowned his has no fortune to his name.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{investigates the}} effects of {{personality}} traits on listening-oriented dialogue to gain insight into building automated listening agents.

Since the role can be a low-profile one, the beneficial effect of a Teamworker can go unnoticed and unappreciated until they are absent, when the team begins to argue, and small but important things cease to happen. Because of an unwillingness to take sides, a Teamworker {{may not be able}} to take decisive action when it's needed.|$|R
