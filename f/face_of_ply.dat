40|$|The problem <b>of</b> <b>ply</b> lifting in {{composite}} materials {{is a significant}} issue for various aerospace and military applications. A fundamental element in the prevention or mitigation <b>of</b> <b>ply</b> lift is determination of the timing <b>of</b> the <b>ply</b> lifting event during exposure of the composite material to flight conditions.

Study of the effects <b>of</b> <b>ply</b> drops and resin pockets on the tensile behaviour of tapered laminates considering certain important parameters like taper angle, the number <b>of</b> <b>plies</b> dropped, and the fiber orientation is reported here. Estimation of the tensile strength of tapered laminates necessitates accurate determination {{of the state of}} stress near the ply-drop region, which is, in general, three-dimensional (3 -D) in nature. Recognising the fact that full 3 -D finite-element analysis becomes computationally exorbitant, special layered 3 -D finite-element analysis is carried out. Laminates with ply drops along only one direction are analysed to elicit the nature of the local bending effects occurring near the ply drops. Complete 3 -D Tsai–Wu criterion considering all the six stress components is used to obtain a quick and comparative assessment of the tensile strength of these laminates. High stress concentration zones are identified and the effects <b>of</b> number <b>of</b> <b>plies</b> dropped at a station and resin pocket geometry are illustrated.

The cytotoxic and inflammatory properties <b>of</b> pneumolysin (<b>PLY)</b> {{have been}} implicated in the pathogenesis of pneumococcal pneumonia. Methods To examine the role <b>of</b> <b>PLY</b> in this experimental model we performed ELISA assays for PLY quantification. The distribution patterns <b>of</b> <b>PLY</b> and apoptosis were established by immunohistochemical detection <b>of</b> <b>PLY,</b> caspase- 9 activity and TUNEL assay on tissue sections from mice lungs at various times, {{and the results were}} quantified with image analysis. Inflammatory and apoptotic cells were also quantified on lung tissue sections from antibody treated mice. Results In bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL), total PLY was found at sublytic concentrations which were located in alveolar macrophages and leukocytes. The bronchoalveolar epithelium was PLY-positive, while the vascular endothelium was not PLY reactive. The pattern and extension of cellular apoptosis was similar. Anti-PLY antibody treatment decreased the lung damage and the number of apoptotic and inflammatory cells in lung tissues. Conclusion The data strongly suggest that in vivo lung injury could be due to the pro-apoptotic and pro-inflammatory activity <b>of</b> <b>PLY,</b> rather than its cytotoxic activity. PLY at sublytic concentrations induces lethal inflammation in lung tissues and is involved in host cell apoptosis, whose effects are important to pathogen survival. </p...|$|R

More realistic and practical edge conditions as in Kirchhoff's theory are considered. An iterative procedure based on point-wise equilibrium equations is adapted. The necessity of a solution of an auxiliary problem in the interior plies is explained and used in the generation of proper sequence of two dimensional problems. Displacements are expanded in terms of polynomials in thickness coordinate such that continuity of transverse stresses across interfaces is assured. Solution of a fourth order system of a supplementary problem in the face ply is necessary to ensure the continuity of in-plane displacements across interfaces and to rectify inadequacies of these polynomial expansions in the interior distribution of approximate solutions. Vertical deflection does not play any role in obtaining all six stress components and two in-plane displacements. In overcoming lacuna in Kirchhoff's theory, widely used first order shear deformation theory and other sixth and higher order theories based on energy principles at laminate level in smeared laminate theories and at ply level in layer-wise theories are not useful in the generation of a proper sequence of 2 -D problems converging to 3 -D problems.

40|$|The {{application}} of composite materials to aircraft construction {{has provided the}} designer with increased flexibility. The orientation <b>of</b> <b>plies</b> can be tailored to provide additional aeroelastic performance unobtainable with an isotropic material. A tailored laminate is made up <b>of</b> <b>plies</b> <b>of</b> several orientations, usually 0 deg, 45 deg, - 45 deg, and 90 deg. The direction of the 0 deg plies, {{does not need to}} be oriented with the leading edge, but can be varied to obtain a wide variety of structural properties. Also, the number <b>of</b> <b>plies</b> <b>of</b> each orientation varies from one zone to another on the planform. Thus, a thick laminate with mainly 0 deg plies may form the root zone, and a thinner laminate with mainly + 45 deg plies may form the leading edge zone. Tailored laminates were designed using complicated optimization programs. Unfortunately, many tailored designs must be modified before they are manufactured. The modification adds weight and decreases performance. One type <b>of</b> modification is <b>ply</b> interleaving, an overlap <b>of</b> <b>plies</b> between zones on the laminate. These interleaves are added to ensure that zones with varying ply percentages can be connected without loss of strength. In this paper, the constraints needed to eliminate interleaves in the laminate optimization process will be described and implemented in a structural optimization problem.

40|$|A bi-level {{optimization}} {{strategy for}} finding the optimal ply numbers and stacking sequence in composite structures {{has become one}} of the most popular techniques in recent years. When the optimization technique is based on the use of lamination parameters, the top level optimization has two subsets of design variables for each substructure (e. g., a panel in wing design) : lamination parameters treated as continuous design variables, and three integers that define the number <b>of</b> <b>plies</b> <b>of</b> 0, 90 and ± 45 orientation. When a continuous optimizer is used at the top level, there is a need for an algorithm to find an integer representation of the obtained continuous number <b>of</b> <b>plies</b> that, ideally, does not alter the mechanical performance of a panel. The focus of this paper is on solving the top level optimization problem whereas the description of local level optimization problem that arranges the stacking sequence can be found in the authors' previous work. In order to determine the integer values <b>of</b> the <b>ply</b> numbers, two schemes based on the lamination parameter matching are introduced in this paper. The strategy is to use a binary code controlling the integer representation <b>of</b> <b>ply</b> numbers in order to obtain a discrete number <b>of</b> <b>plies</b> <b>of</b> each orientation per composite panel. An optimization problem is formulated where the objective function (to be minimized) defines how close the lamination parameter values and the panel thickness, obtained in the top level optimization, are to their values when integer ply numbers are considered. Such an optimization problem is solved by a permutation GA for each individual panel. A wing box benchmark problem is used to demonstrate the potential of these methods. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The work presented in this paper deals with optimizing the orientation <b>of</b> <b>plies</b> in a simply supported composite cylindrical panel so as to achieve maximum buckling load. The panel is assumed to be composed of a repeated sublaminate construction. In this type of construction the basic sublaminate has a smaller number <b>of</b> <b>plies,</b> for example, 8, 6, 4 or 2, and the full panel is obtained by repeating the basic sublaminate.

Analysis <b>of</b> <b>Ply</b> binding to a glycan microarray revealed that Ply has lectin activity and binds glycans, including the Lewis histo- blood group antigens. Surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that Ply has the highest affinity for the sialyl LewisX (sLeX) structure, with a Kd of 1. 88 ! 10 ! 5 M. Ply hemolytic activity against human RBCs showed dose-dependent inhibition by sLeX. Flow cytometric analysis and Western blots showed that blocking binding <b>of</b> <b>Ply</b> to the sLeX glycolipid on RBCs prevents deposition of the toxin in the membrane. The lectin domain responsible for sLeX binding is in domain 4 <b>of</b> <b>Ply,</b> which contains candidate car- bohydrate-binding sites. Mutagenesis of these predicted carbohy- drate-binding residues <b>of</b> <b>Ply</b> resulted in a decrease in hemolytic activity and a reduced affinity for sLeX. This study reveals that this archetypal CDC requires interaction with the sLeX glycolipid cellu- lar receptor as an essential step before membrane insertion. A similar analysis conducted on streptolysin O from Streptococcus pyogenes revealed that this CDC also has glycan-binding proper- ties and that hemolytic activity against RBCs can be blocked with the glycan lacto-N-neotetraose by inhibiting binding to the cell surface.
