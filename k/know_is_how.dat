Their poverty forced the children to work, and Goldman took an assortment of jobs, including one in a corset shop.

500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review for Rolling Stone, Christopher Connelly called Thriller [...] "a zesty LP" [...] with a [...] "harrowing, dark message". He compared {{the songs on}} the album with the life challenges that the 24-year-old Jackson had faced since Off the Wall, while observing that he [...] "dropped the boyish falsetto" [...] and was facing his [...] "challenges head-on" [...] with [...] "a feisty determination" [...] and [...] "a full, adult voice". John Rockwell wrote in The New York Times that perhaps Jackson was a [...] "sometimes too practiced ... performer", that at times Quincy Jones may [...] "depersonalize his individuality" [...] with his [...] "slightly anonymous production", and that Jackson may be hiding his true emotions behind [...] "layers of impenetrable, gauzy veils". He nonetheless deemed Thriller [...] "a wonderful pop record, the latest statement {{by one of the}} great singers in popular music today" [...] and that there are [...] "hits here, too, lots of them". Rockwell believed it helped breach [...] "the destructive barriers that spring up regularly between white and black music", especially as [...] "white publications and radio stations that normally avoid black music seem willing to pretend he isn't black after all". In The Village Voice, Robert Christgau said [...] "this is virtually a hits-plus-filler job, but at such a high level it's almost classic anyway". He later wrote in retrospect, [...] "what we couldn't <b>know</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> brilliantly every hit but 'P.Y.T.' would thrive on mass exposure and public pleasure." [...] A year after the album's release, Time summed up the three main singles from the album, saying, [...] "The pulse of America and {{much of the rest of}} the world moves irregularly, beating in time to the tough strut of 'Billie Jean', the asphalt aria of 'Beat It', the supremely cool chills of 'Thriller'." [...] In 1989, Toronto Star music critics reflected on the albums they had reviewed in the past ten years in order to create a list judging them on the basis of [...] "commercial impact to social import, to strictly musical merit." [...] Thriller was placed at number 1 on the list, where it was referred to as his [...] "master work" [...] and that [...] "commercial success has since overshadowed Jackson's artistic accomplishments on Thriller, and that's a pity. It was a record for the times, brimming with breathless anticipation and a dread fear of the adult world, a brilliant fantasy that pumped with sexual heat, yet made room for serious reflection".|$|E

In new research, Sébastien Breau finds that inequality is higher in the western provinces compared to the eastern ones, and between urban and rural regions. He writes that these geographical differences in inequality are linked to a region’s industrial composition, local demographics, and the decline in unionization rates and cutbacks to government welfare programs...|$|R

40|$|Many {{researchers}} have focussed their efforts in developing collaborative recommender systems.

The collaborative relationships in recommender systems can be represented as a social network. In this paper we propose several measures to analyse collaboration based on social networks analysis. Once this measures are explained, we use them to evaluate a concrete example of collaboration in a real recommender system...|$|R
40|$|It {{has long}} <b>been</b> <b>known</b> that two scaling factors and three spectra, {{corresponding}} to three different end conditions, {{are required to}} determine the masses, lengths and stiffnesses in a discrete model of a beam in flexural vibration.

This paper presents two procedures for finding families of such isospectral beams. The first uses shifted QR factorization and yields a four-parameter family. The second uses Toda flow to find another, more restricted family...|$|R

40|$|It <b>is</b> <b>known</b> that Artemia spp. {{increase}} their speed in warmer water.

We developed an automated system for tracking the motion of multiple objects in 3 dimensions. This system could be used to calculate the motion of Artemia spp. in a temperature and viscosity controlled environment. From that one could determine what the effects of these variables are on Artemia spp. motion...|$|R
40|$|Quality of students' intakes {{is one of}} {{the factors}} that {{contribute}} to quality of graduates. Where post-graduate studies is concerned undergraduate CPAs has always been the strong basis for either rejecting or accepting an applicant. For a course of study of the same discipline, it is a accepted believe that, high CPA at degree level is associated with good performance at graduate level. Less <b>known</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> good the undergraduate CPA at predicting performance in graduate studies. Much less <b>known</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> good CPA in one discipline at predicting CPA in another discipline. In this study, we attempted to discover the relationship between undergraduate CPAs, field of study at undergraduate level, and graduate performance in technical teacher training programme. Our sample was 612 students from five cohorts of the Masters in Technical and Vocational Education programme. Our data were based on students' academic records. Using Pearson product Moment correlations method, we found that overall; the correlations between undergraduate and graduate CPAs are weak but statistically significant (r= 0. 35, p< 0. 01). Our analyses on the outlier cases indicate an association between active participations in co-curricular activities at the undergraduate level and high graduate CPA. We therefore recommend that in addition to undergraduate CPA, other variables could be looked into for selection of students into graduate studies...|$|R

40|$|London is in {{the throes}} of a housing supply crisis, we all know this by now. What <b>is</b> less <b>known</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> to address it in a way that {{produces}} new stock quickly, efficiently and of high quality. While often overlooked, there is a precedent in London’s history for doing this successfully: the use of prefabricated technologies in post-war home-building. Yet despite its original practicality, the stigmatised connotations associated with ‘prefab’ have inhibited it from serving as a legitimate housing solution. The charity organisation YMCA London South West (YMCA LSW) is now challenging this vision through the development of a pioneering modular housing scheme known as Y:Cube...|$|R
