However, when subjected to cyclic <b>horizontal</b> <b>actions,</b> such as earthquakes, they can present a deficient behaviour. With the purpose of evaluating the seismic vulnerability of adobe structures, {{a series of tests}} were conducted on a full-scale adobe wall considering constant dead and live loads combined with cyclic <b>horizontal</b> <b>actions</b> with rising amplitude. A structural strengthening solution was tested on the repaired wall after its assessment test. The adopted repair solution, based on cracks injection, combined with the strengthening solution, proved to be very efficient in improving the performance of the adobe wall. With the study conducted, it was possible to contribute to the characterization of adobe structural walls in terms of deformation capacity and failure modes, establishing the basis for the calibration of numerical models for adobe structures...|$|R

In the code, masonry is modelled through a fictitious macroscopic homogeneous material. Masonry macroscopic mechanical properties are obtained {{by means of}} a recently presented equilibrated limit analysis approach performed on a suitable unit cell, which generates the entire structure by repetition. Masonry homogenised failure surfaces are then implemented in the 3 D code here outlined. With respect to previously presented models, the algorithm allows to analyze real scale buildings for coupled in-plane and out-of-plane actions. The possible presence of steel, RC and ring beams is also considered introducing in the numerical model two-node beam elements. A relevant 3 D structural example consisting of a masonry school subjected to <b>horizontal</b> <b>actions</b> is treated.

50|$|Rain Bird had {{its origins}} in early 1933 when Glendora, California citrus grower Orton Englehardt {{developed}} the first prototype of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>action</b> impact sprinkler. The new design offered slow rotation and more efficient watering than other sprinklers of that era, features that were long sought after by local irrigators. Orton's friend and neighbor Clement LaFetra began helping him make and market the sprinklers, and they urged him to patent the invention. The patent (U.S. Patent No. 1,997,901) was awarded on April 16, 1935. Englehardt preferred farming, so in 1935 he sold the business to Clement and Mary Elizabeth LaFetra, whose descendants still operate the company today.|$|E

40|$|Several {{methods of}} {{analysis}} are available in engineering practice to study old masonry constructions. Two commonly used approaches {{in the field of}} seismic engineering are global and local analyses. Despite several years of research in this field, the various methodologies suffer from a lack of comprehensive experimental validation. This is mainly due to the difficulty in simulating the many different kinds of masonry and, accordingly, the non-linear response under <b>horizontal</b> <b>actions.</b> This issue can be addressed by examining the local response of isolated panels under monotonic and/or alternate actions. Different testing methodologies are commonly used to identify the local response of old masonry. These range from simplified pull-out tests to sophisticated in-plane monotonic tests. However, {{there is a lack of}} both knowledge and critical comparison between experimental validations and numerical simulations. This is mainly due to the difficulties in implementing irregular settings within both simplified and advanced numerical analyses. Similarly, the simulation of degradation effects within laboratory tests is difficult with respect to old masonry in-situ boundary conditions. Numerical models, particularly on rubble masonry, are commonly simplified. They are mainly based on a kinematic chain of rigid blocks able to perform different “modes of damage” of structures subjected to <b>horizontal</b> <b>actions.</b> This paper presents an innovative methodology for testing; its aim is to identify a simplified model for out-of-plane response of rubbleworks with respect to the experimental evidence.

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{practical}} {{method is}} developed for calculating stresses and velocities at depth using field {{measurements of the}} geometry and surface velocity of glaciers. To do this, it is convenient to partition full stresses into lithostatic and resistive components. The horizontal gradient in vertically integrated lithostatic stress is the driving stress and it describes the <b>horizontal</b> <b>action</b> of gravity. The horizontal resistive stress gradients describe the reactions. Resistive stresses are simply related to deviatoric stresses and hence to strain-rates through a constitutive relation. A numerical scheme {{can be used to}} calculate stresses and velocities from surface velocities and slope, and from ice thickness. There is no mathematical requirement that the variations in these quantities be small...|$|E

40|$|After the 2005 M 7. 6 Kashmir {{earthquake}} (Pakistan), field observations {{reported that}} several buildings manufactured with traditional techniques well resisted to this strong seismic event. Nonetheless, these techniques {{have never been}} deeply studied from a structural engineering point of view yet. This thesis reports a full analytical study on the static and seismic behavior of simple one-storey buildings made with a typical construction technique commonly named as “Bhatar” system, used for several centuries and widely diffused in rather remote areas of the Himalayan regions like India, Nepal and Pakistan. The Bhatar system consists of load-bearing walls made of common dry-stacked rubble stone masonry held together by horizontal wooden bands disposed at several levels (spaced at intervals of about 60 cm). It is widely adopted in developing countries due to its advantages from both economical and constructive point of view {{with respect to the}} conventional constructions techniques (i. e. brick masonry and concrete structures). In the present work, analytical analyses are conducted with reference to a one-storey building modulus characterized by a 3. 6 m x 3. 6 m square plan covered by an heavy wooden roof with 20 cm thick earth coverage, in order to investigate its response under both gravity and seismic inertial loadings. In detail, in-plane and out-of-plane response of a single wall under <b>horizontal</b> <b>actions</b> is discussed and particular attention is focused on the connections between the timber elements, which are fundamental for the transmission of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>actions</b> and for preventing overturning and other failure mechanisms. The main aim is twofold: (i) to provide a first insight into the actual seismic response of such construction technique, as a basis for the specific design of ad-hoc laboratory tests on full-scale models, and (ii) to give some rules of thumb for a proper dimensioning and construction of this kind of structures...|$|R

To this diagram is superimposed {{a web of}} representations of the Ding-Iohara-Miki (DIM) algebra that acts on the partition function. In this correspondence, each segment is associated to a representation, and the (topological string) vertex is identified with the intertwiner operator constructed by Awata, Feigin and Shiraishi. We define a new intertwiner acting on the representation spaces of levels (1,n) ⊗(0,m) →(1,n+m), thereby generalizing to higher rank m the original construction. It allows us to use a folded version of the usual (p,q) -web diagram, bringing great simplifications to actual computations. As a result, the characterization of Gaiotto states and vertical intertwiners, previously obtained {{by some of the}} authors, is uplifted to operator relations acting in the Fock space of horizontal representations. We further develop a method to build qq-characters of linear quivers based on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>action</b> of DIM elements. While fundamental qq-characters can be built using the coproduct, higher ones require the introduction of a (quantum) Weyl reflection acting on tensor products of DIM generators.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the current prospects of small-scale manufacturing firms in Peru. The author argues that their viability depends, among other factors, on {{their access to}} various services such as specialized information on markets and technology, technical training and assistance, negotiations and actions to remove obstacles to foreign trade. These firms are facing intense competition with imported goods, which are produced and assembled abroad by firms that do have access to these services. Three modes of organizing the provision of these services are examined, namely market relations, contractual (vertical) relations and collective (<b>horizontal)</b> <b>action.</b> Market provision is limited insofar these services have, in some degree, the attributes of public goods (indivisible and non-excludable). Furthermore, their provision requires interactions {{in a context of}} asymmetric information and in some cases involves substantial investments and non-negligible sunk costs. Contractual relations within the vertical chain of activities, on the other hand, appear to be significant in agriculture. Their scope in urban settings is limited, however, {{due to the lack of}} production standards and heterogeneous technology, as well as higher transaction costs. Finally, collective action is hindered by the fragmentation and lack of legitimacy of producers' associations, the heterogeneity of social norms and the weakness of the judiciary system. These factors reduce the possibilities of successful negotiation. The limits of these modes of organization provide a rationale for new forms of State intervention, this time in close cooperation with the private sector in order to secure technical competence and financial sustainability. ...|$|E
