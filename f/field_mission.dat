5|$|On March 10, 2002, Jolie adopted {{her first}} child, seven-month-old Maddox Chivan, from an orphanage in Battambang, Cambodia. He was born as Rath Vibol on August 5, 2001, {{in a local}} village. After twice visiting Cambodia, while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and on a UNHCR <b>field</b> <b>mission,</b> Jolie {{returned}} in November 2001 with her husband, Billy Bob Thornton, where they met Maddox and subsequently applied to adopt him. The adoption process was halted the following month when the U.S. government banned adoptions from Cambodia amid allegations of child trafficking. Although Jolie's adoption facilitator was later convicted of visa fraud and money laundering, her adoption of Maddox was deemed lawful. Once the process was finalized, she took custody of him in Namibia, where she was filming Beyond Borders (2003). Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption together, but she adopted Maddox alone, and raised him as a single parent following their separation three months later.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his career, Messi {{has been}} {{involved}} in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood. Since 2004, he has contributed his time and finances to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), an organisation with which Barcelona also have a strong association. Messi has served as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador since his appointment in March 2010, completing his first <b>field</b> <b>mission</b> for the organisation four months later as he travelled to Haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country's children {{in the wake of the}} recent earthquake. He has since participated in UNICEF campaigns targeting HIV prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children. To celebrate his son's first birthday, in November 2013, Messi and Thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.|$|E

50|$|Up to $100,000 a year {{is raised}} for the field {{missions}}; however, only $300 of this total is given {{to each of the}} <b>field</b> <b>missions</b> per month (or about $43,000 yearly for all 12 missions combined). Many ministers of <b>field</b> <b>missions</b> report that they live in poverty. Other reports show the amount of money given the <b>field</b> <b>missions</b> is even less.|$|R
25|$|Although {{the medical}} volunteers almost always receive the most media {{attention}} {{when the world}} becomes aware of an MSF <b>field</b> <b>mission,</b> {{there are a number}} of non-medical volunteers who help keep the <b>field</b> <b>mission</b> functioning. Logisticians are responsible for providing everything that the medical component of a mission needs, ranging from security and vehicle maintenance to food and electricity supplies. They may be engineers and/or foremen, but they usually also help with setting up treatment centres and supervising local staff. Other non-medical staff are water/sanitation specialists, who are usually experienced engineers in the fields of water treatment and management and financial/administration/human resources experts who are placed with field missions.|$|E
25|$|Medical volunteers include physicians, surgeons, nurses, {{and various}} other specialists. In {{addition}} to operating the medical and nutrition components of the <b>field</b> <b>mission,</b> these volunteers are sometimes {{in charge of a}} group of local medical staff and provide training for them.|$|E
25|$|The Kashmir Conflict in {{northern}} India {{resulted in a}} more recent MSF intervention (the first <b>field</b> <b>mission</b> {{was set up in}} 1999) to help civilians displaced by fighting in Jammu and Kashmir, as well as in Manipur. Psychological support is a major target of missions, but teams have also set up programmes to treat tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and malaria. Mental health support has been of significant importance for MSF in much of southern Asia since the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.|$|E

25|$|<b>Field</b> <b>missions</b> {{were set}} up to provide relief to Kurdish {{refugees}} who had survived the al-Anfal Campaign, for which evidence of atrocities was being collected in 1991. 1991 also saw {{the beginning of the}} civil war in Somalia, during which MSF set up <b>field</b> <b>missions</b> in 1992 alongside a UN peacekeeping mission. Although the UN-aborted operations by 1993, MSF representatives continued with their relief work, running clinics and hospitals for civilians.|$|R
25|$|MSF {{first set}} up a <b>field</b> <b>mission</b> in Côte d'Ivoire in 1990, but ongoing {{violence}} and the 2002 division of the country by rebel groups and the government led to several massacres, and MSF teams have even begun to suspect that an ethnic cleansing is occurring. Mass measles vaccinations, tuberculosis treatment and the re-opening of hospitals closed by fighting are projects run by MSF, {{which is the only}} group providing aid in much of the country.|$|E
25|$|Duke then {{traveled}} down to Florida, {{where he}} and Roadblock met up with Cutter and Deep Six, taking the W.H.A.L.E. hovercraft and attacking Zartan's swamp shack hideout in the Florida Everglades. After Destro and Firefly steal the W.H.A.L.E., Duke and Wild Bill take the Dragonfly copter to go after Destro and recover the vehicle. His next <b>field</b> <b>mission</b> is to investigate a suspected Cobra undercover agent on Staten Island. The agent escapes, but leaves behind clues to a secret Cobra operation in the Gulf of Mexico. Duke leads an assault team on the newly formed Cobra Island, but is forced to withdraw when the island is officially recognized as a sovereign state.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>field</b> <b>mission</b> team usually {{consists}} of {{a small number of}} coordinators to head each component of a <b>field</b> <b>mission,</b> and a [...] "head of mission."

2500|$|Before a <b>field</b> <b>mission</b> is {{established}} in a country, an MSF team visits {{the area to}} determine {{the nature of the}} humanitarian emergency, the level of safety in the area and what type of aid is needed (this is called an [...] "exploratory mission").|$|E
2500|$|The {{air force}} has three levels of badges: other than the basic badge, there is a Chaplain Assistant Badge-Senior, and a Chaplain Assistant Badge-Master.

2500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, the ICRC {{is not a}} {{sovereign}} entity like the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and also {{it is not an}} international organization, neither of non-governmental nor of governmental type. The ICRC limits its membership to Swiss nationals only, and also [...] it does not have a policy of open and unrestricted membership for individuals as its new members are selected by the Committee itself (a process called cooptation). However, since the early 1990s, the ICRC employs persons {{from all over the world}} to serve in its <b>field</b> <b>mission</b> and at Headquarters. In 2007, almost half of ICRC staff was non-Swiss. The ICRC has special privileges and legal immunities in many countries, based on national law in these countries, based on agreements between the ICRC and the respective governments, or, in some cases, based on international jurisprudence (such as the right of ICRC delegates not to bear witness in front of international tribunals).|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} {{accurately}} report {{the conditions of}} a humanitarian emergency {{to the rest of}} the world and to governing bodies, data on a number of factors are collected during each <b>field</b> <b>mission.</b> The rate of malnutrition in children is used to determine the malnutrition rate in the population, and then to determine the need for feeding centres. Various types of mortality rates are used to report the seriousness of a humanitarian emergency, and a common method used to measure mortality in a population is to have staff constantly monitoring the number of burials at cemeteries. By compiling data on the frequency of diseases in hospitals, MSF can track the occurrence and location of epidemic increases (or [...] "seasons") and stockpile vaccines and other drugs. For example, the [...] "Meningitis Belt" [...] (sub-Saharan Africa, which sees the most cases of meningitis in the world) has been [...] "mapped" [...] and the meningitis season occurs between December and June. Shifts in the location of the Belt and the timing of the season can be predicted using cumulative data over many years.|$|E
