5|$|The star's {{magnitude}} as observed from Earth is 9; this signifies {{that the}} body is not visible with the naked eye, but can be seen with a telescope. HD 2039 lies roughly 330 light years <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> which is about as far <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> as the second brightest star in the night sky, Canopus.|$|E
5|$|Vesta is the {{brightest}} asteroid visible from Earth. Its maximum distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> is slightly {{greater than the}} minimum distance of Ceres <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> though its orbit lies entirely within that of Ceres.|$|E

5|$|Because the Earth's {{orbit around}} the Sun is also elliptical, the Earth's {{distance}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> similarly varies throughout the year. This affects the apparent size of the Sun in the same way, {{but not as much}} as does the Moon's varying distance from Earth. When Earth approaches its farthest distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> in early July, a total eclipse is somewhat more likely, whereas conditions favour an annular eclipse when Earth approaches its closest distance to the Sun in early January.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{the furthest}} known objects, such as Comet West, have aphelia around 70,000 AU <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> {{but as the}} Oort cloud becomes better known, this may change.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp's orbital {{position}} was calculated as 7.2astronomical units (AU) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> placing it between Jupiter and Saturn and {{by far the}} greatest distance from Earth at which a comet had been discovered by amateurs. Most comets at this distance are extremely faint, and show no discernible activity, but Hale–Bopp already had an observable coma. An image taken at the Anglo-Australian Telescope in 1993 was found to show the then-unnoticed comet some 13AU <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> a distance at which most comets are essentially unobservable. (Halley's Comet was more than 100 times fainter at the same distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun.)</b> Analysis indicated later that its comet nucleus was 60±20kilometres in diameter, approximately six {{times the size of}} Halley.|$|E

5|$|One {{explanation}} is {{the exposure of}} whiter subsurface layers by impacts; another is that the scattered objects' greater distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> creates a composition gradient, analogous to the composition gradient of the terrestrial and gas giant planets. Mike Brown, discoverer of the scattered object Eris, suggests that its paler colour could be because, at its current distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> its atmosphere of methane is frozen over its entire surface, creating an inches-thick layer of bright white ice. Pluto, conversely, being closer to the Sun, would be warm enough that methane would freeze only onto cooler, high-albedo regions, leaving low-albedo tholin-covered regions bare of ice.|$|E

5|$|The Planet Nine {{hypothesis}} {{suggests that}} the orbits of several detached objects {{can be explained by}} the gravitational influence of a large, unobserved planet between 200 AU and 1200 AU <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> and/or the influence of Neptune.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurs at}} the termination shock, which is roughly 80–100AU <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> upwind of the interstellar medium and roughly 200AU <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> downwind. Here the wind slows dramatically, condenses and becomes more turbulent, forming a great oval structure known as the heliosheath. This structure is thought to look and behave {{very much like a}} comet's tail, extending outward for a further 40AU on the upwind side but tailing many times that distance downwind; evidence from Cassini and Interstellar Boundary Explorer spacecraft has suggested that it is forced into a bubble shape by the constraining action of the interstellar magnetic field.|$|E

5|$|With a few exceptions, {{the farther}} a planet or belt is <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> {{the larger the}} {{distance}} between its orbit and the orbit of the next nearer object to the Sun.
