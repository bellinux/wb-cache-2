50|$|Flow {{through the}} main is by gravity under the driving head of the service {{reservoirs}} at the source WTWs. By virtue of its depth, the pipeline is under some pressure; however, the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>grade</b> <b>line</b> rarely exceeds ground level, and, to enter, supply water must be pumped up into the distribution zones at the pump-out shafts. In some respects, therefore, the main {{can be considered as}} a minor reservoir, from which supply is drawn as required. An indication of this dynamic variation in demand is that the minimum hydraulic level moves between the Battersea and Park Lane pump-out shafts. The loop is closed to provide the redundancy that allows any segment on the ring to be isolated and drained for maintenance without interrupting the supply to any shaft, not for hydraulic reasons.|$|E

A water-hammer event is initiated by the closure of a valve in a simple reservoir-pipeline-valve system. The sequence of events following an instantaneous valve closure leading to the formation and collapse of a vapor cavity and the resultant occurrence of a short-duration pressure pulse are described. Short-duration pressure pulses result from the superposition of the valve-closure water-hammer wave and the wave generated by the collapse of the vapor cavity. The resulting maximum pressure may exceed the Joukowsky pressure generated from the initial valve closure.

40|$|A {{transient}} {{or water}} hammer event is initiated whenever a steady-state condition in a pipeline is disturbed either by a planned event or accidentally. When the transient reaches a leak, the transient will be reflected and transmitted, {{which results in}} a different transient event compared to the transient from the same pipeline without a leak. In a previous study, an analytical solution for the variation in <b>hydraulic</b> <b>grade</b> <b>line</b> (HGL) {{expressed in terms of}} a Fourier series has been obtained based on a pipeline with known initial conditions and constant boundary conditions. Based on the analytical solution, a leak detection method was developed previously using leak-induced transient damping. However, The Fourier series approach is not well suited to the case where the boundary conditions vary during the transient event. A Laplace transform solution approach overcomes this difficulty and is the focus of this paper. Normalized hyperbolic governing equations for a pressure transient in a pipeline with a leak are derived, where the discontinuity induced by a leak is considered by using a delta function. In addition the orifice-leak equation is linearized. The accuracy of the analytical solution has been verified by nonlinear numerical analyses using the method of characteristics. The effects of a leak on pipeline transients induced by a pulse boundary perturbation and a continuously changing boundary perturbation are investigated in detail.

40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Introduction: In 2013, Madison Water Utility (MWU) {{consumed}} 19, 660, 250 kWh {{of energy}} to pump just over 10 {{million gallons of water}} (PSC 2013). Numerous benefits are observed by a utility when energy savings measures are implemented, with benefits being economic, environmental, operational, and customer relations in nature. Research performed for this project was aimed at identifying energy conserving practices, and applying them to Madison Water Utility?s system to observe the greatest energy savings. The objectives of the research are: 1. A system-wide variable frequency drive (VFD) study aimed at determining which wells in MWU?s system have characteristics that are ideal for future VFD installations 2. A system demand study in Pressure Zone 4, to characterize the impacts of peak demand periods on annual energy use 3. A hydraulic modeling study of Pressure Zone 4, aimed at estimating the energy savings produced by capital improvements and modifications to hydraulic operations within the zone. Background: On average, drinking water utilities are allocating 30 - 40 % of their total annual operating budget to energy use, of which 94 % or more can be attributed to pumping (Hamilton et al. 2009 and Elliot et al. 2003). Energy intensity can be defined as the amount of energy required to pump, treat, and deliver water to the customer?s tap. Energy intensity is a metric used to benchmark utilities on, and is reported as kilowatt-hours per thousand gallons pumped (kWh/kgal). In 2013, Madison Water Utility consumed 1. 95 kWh/kgal, close to the Wisconsin groundwater utility average of 1. 94 kWh/kgal (PSC 2013). However, energy savings are attainable, with estimates by the Water Research Foundation (WRF) predicting 10 - 30 % savings by all water utilities (WRF 2011). Energy consumption by pumping systems can be divided into two categories: energy consumed by components that are lifting water, and excess energy consumed due to inefficiencies. Deep well pumps and booster pumps lift water from the ground to the distribution system where it can flow into customer?s taps, consuming large amounts {{of energy to}} complete this process. Along the way, energy inefficiencies accumulate, requiring more energy to deliver water than would otherwise be needed. Inefficiencies may include friction, an improperly sized pump, elevated water pressure at a tap, or an aging motor that is no longer operating at its maximum efficiency. To combat high energy use, energy conservation practices including variable frequency drive (VFD) installation, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>grade</b> <b>line</b> management, and flow distribution analyses were tested. Furthermore, pipe modification to reduce headloss, demand reductions to conserve water, and well refurbishment to improve efficiency were examined. Finally, off-peak pumping was tested to determine feasibility and potential energy savings of running pumps at night when energy rates are lowest. Methods: Three studies were performed with the goal of minimizing energy use in as many ways as possible. Much of the analysis revolved around Pressure Zone 4 (PZ 4), while the remaining analysis was performed on previously tested wells. The VFD study used previously collected data by Baniel (2013) to group wells according to specific capacity, a well property that defines the amount of drawdown for a given flow rate. Wells were grouped into low, medium, and high specific capacities, and a representative from each group was analyzed for energy savings and payback. This study allowed for the selection of a group of wells with which to implement VFDs in the future. The energy use characterization of various system demands study utilized MWU?s supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system and Madison Gas and Electric (MG&E) as data sources. Analysis of SCADA data was performed to identify flow ranges, or flow bins, where energy use was high. The hydraulic modeling software H 2 OMAP Water GIS was then used to test the energy use in each flow bin in Pressure Zone 4, attempting to identify flow bins which were consuming large quantities of energy. The study allowed for energy conservation measures to be specifically applied and optimized in flow bins of interest. The final study revolved around PZ 4, specifically Unit Wells 9 and 31. Again, the hydraulic modeling software H 2 OMAP Water GIS was used to test (1) the optimal VFD speed of the UW 31 deep well pump, (2) off-peak pumping feasibility, (3) optimal flow distribution between the two wells, and (4) optimal <b>hydraulic</b> <b>grade</b> <b>line.</b> Significant input data was required to test the various scenarios including pump curves, MG&E rates, PZ 4 demands, and information about the proposed well (UW 31). Energy use and predicted savings were identified for each model variable, then payback of the option was determined to identify the economic feasibility. This study provided estimates of how to operate PZ 4 in the most energy efficient manner. Results: Results of the VFD study outlined the projected energy savings of high, medium, and low specific capacity site of Madison Water Utility. It was found that high specific capacity sites (> 21. 1 gpm/ft) generally had low energy use, low head savings, and low cost savings. Medium specific capacity sites (13. 8 ? 21. 1 gpm/ft) were found to have higher energy use than high specific capacity sites, on average, with greater potential for head savings. Large energy savings were found to be possible in some cases, with payback periods between 5 and 10 years being possible. Low specific capacity well sites ( 2. 1 MGD); Pressure Zones 7, 8, 9, and 10 all have similar characteristics and off-peak pumping should be tested in these zones. ? Operate UW 9 and UW 31 between a 60 / 40 operation and 75 / 25 operation to combat seasonal demand fluctuations, to maintain hydraulic residence time, and energy conservation guidelines by MWU. A 60 / 40 operation works during all seasons. ? Do not perform <b>hydraulic</b> <b>grade</b> <b>line</b> reductions in PZ 4 due to pressure concerns. ? Do not perform pipe modifications in PZ 4 to save energy, but only for operational reasons such as improved flow conditions. ? Continue flow reduction efforts as they have been found to conserve energy and water. ? Continue use of the hydraulic modeling software due to the benefits of energy analyses it can perform prior to implementing options, especially on small pressure zones and preliminary testing of alternatives...|$|E

Despite the {{extensive}} research work {{carried out on}} flow through short square-edged orifice plates {{over the last century}} (e. g. Johansen, 1930; Benedict, 1977; Alvi et al., 1978; Swamee, 2005; ESDU, 2007), gaps in the engineering data still exist for certain ranges of flow conditions and geometries. The majority of data available in the literature are for Newtonian fluids in the turbulent flow regime (ESDU, 2007). Insufficient data have been observed for the orifice with pipe diameter ratio, β = 0. 2, in the laminar flow regime. There are no experimental data for β = 0. 3 and 0. 57. The objective of this thesis was to conduct wide-ranging experimental studies of the flow in orifice plates, which included those geometrical configurations, by measuring pressure loss coefficients and discharge coefficients across the orifice plates using both Newtonian fluids and non-Newtonian fluids in both laminar and turbulent flow regimes. The test work was conducted on the valve test rig at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology. Four classical circular short square-edged orifice plates having, β = 0. 2, 0. 3, 0. 57 and 0. 7, were tested. In addition, two generation 0 Von Koch orifice plates (Von Koch, 1904), with equivalent cross sectional area were also tested for β = 0. 57. Water was used as Newtonian fluid to obtain turbulent regime data and also for calibration purposes to ensure measurement accuracy and carboxymethyl cellulose, bentonite and kaolin slurries were used at different concentrations to obtain laminar and transitional loss coefficient data. The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>grade</b> <b>line</b> method was used to evaluate pressure loss coefficients (Edwards et al., 1985), while the flange tap arrangement method was used to determine the discharge coefficients (ESDU, 2007).

HGL is used, instead of elevation, data because it is significantly more precise than elevation data. Because 2.31 ft of elevation translates into 1 psi of pressure (for water), calculating pressure to 1 psi precision requires elevation data that's accurate to roughly 2 ft. Normal elevation data that is accurate to the nearest 10 ft will result in pressure that is accurate to roughly 4 psi.|$|R

40|$|Traditionally {{the design}} of <b>grade</b> <b>lines</b> of {{highways}} is allocated to senior civil engineers because of the inherent complexity and the compromises that must be made. At one hand multiple, and often contradictory constraints must be simultaneously met {{and on the other}} hand the design must be optimized for safety and cost. While the experience of a senior engineer is indispensable for the political and social aspects of the highway, a good first approximation is feasible with todays computers. In this work {{the design of}} <b>grade</b> <b>line</b> is approached with simulated annealing, which is a stochastic optimization method suitable for multi-optimization problems of large scale, especially ones where the desired global extremum is hidden among many, poorer, local extrema. It is insensitive to initial approximation and can easily take into account diverse constraints. The entities to be optimized are cut-fill for cost, and <b>grade</b> <b>line</b> geometry for safety. The constraints are obligatory horizontal points, obligatory elevations, and limitations of slope and vertical curves. The value of the entities is translated to penalties or energy, with suitable functions. Analogous functions translate constraints satisfactions to penalties or energy. The relative energy of the entities and constraints must be chosen carefully and may vary due to local conditions such as terrain. The energy is minimized by making random and appropriate changes, such as the introduction of a new node, to an original system configuration. Gradually the changes are becoming less and less agile, through the decrease of a control parameter which simulates the temperature, and converge to the optimum solution.
