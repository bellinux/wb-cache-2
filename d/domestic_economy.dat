5|$|Quantitative easing (QE) is the {{practice}} in which a central bank tries to mitigate a potential or actual recession by increasing the money supply for its <b>domestic</b> <b>economy.</b> This {{can be done by}} printing money and injecting it into the <b>domestic</b> <b>economy</b> via open market operations. There may be a promise to destroy any newly created money once the economy improves in order to avoid inflation.|$|E
5|$|A third {{method is}} for {{authorities}} simply to talk down {{the value of}} their currency by hinting at future action to discourage speculators from betting on a future rise, though sometimes this has little discernible effect. Finally, a central bank can effect a devaluation by lowering its base rate of interest; however this sometimes has limited effect, and, since the end of World War II, most central banks have set their base rate according to the needs of their <b>domestic</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|E

Its purpose was to assist Haitians in developing sustainable paradigms for medium-term and long-term economic growth as well as creating jobs that stabilize its <b>domestic</b> <b>economy.</b> The Fund raised $54 million, and during its term, the Fund estimated that its programs sustained or created 7,350 jobs, trained 20,050 individuals, and had an additional positive impact on the conditions of more than 311,000 Haitians.|$|E
50|$|Even {{though a}} state-centered {{approach}} directs {{our attention to}} the important role that states play in shaping the structure of their <b>domestic</b> <b>economies,</b> it does have some important weaknesses.

40|$|Cooking {{methods and}} practises are crucial in {{defining}} group identity, in expressing social and kin networks, and in reflecting <b>domestic</b> <b>economies.</b> In this paper I discuss fire installations and fire related utensils from a functional and typological point of view, throughout the prehistoric and early historic phases of occupation at the East Anatolian site of Arslantepe, {{over a period}} of nearly 2500 years (4200 - 1750 BCE). Arslantepe, through this long sequence, testifies to the development of hierarchical societies, the origin of primary state and its collapse, groups of semi-mobile pastoral communities and then small towns of farmers. Through the distribution of cooking facilities, their attributes and peculiarities, <b>domestic</b> <b>economies</b> and social relations linked to food preparation and consumption are investigated at the site...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{explanations}} for trade misinvoicing [...] high custom duties and weak <b>domestic</b> <b>economies</b> — are less persuasive {{in a world}} of high growth emerging markets who have low trade barriers. A 35 - country data set over a 26 year span, covering both industrialised and developing countries, to study the phenomena of export and import misinvoicing is costructed. Capital account openness, differentials in interest rates, political stability, corruption, indebtedness and the exchange rate regime are identified as factors related to misinvoicing. Trade misinvoicing should be seen as one element of de facto capital account openness.

5|$|In addition, {{the value}} of foreign {{currency}} bonds which matured {{in the remainder of}} 2008 was only $600 million, and foreign currency debt service in 2009 was only $215 million, well within the government's ability to pay. However the agencies believed that the government would have to issue more foreign currency bonds, both to cover losses as the banks' overseas operations are liquidated and also to stimulate demand in the <b>domestic</b> <b>economy</b> as Iceland goes into recession.|$|E
5|$|Born in Fallowfield, Manchester, Nagle was the {{daughter}} of Sir William George Watson, 1st Baronet of Sulhamstead (1861–1930) and his second wife Bessie (née Atkinson); she was also the elder sister of art connoisseur Peter Watson. Nagle was educated at Wycombe Abbey before studying <b>domestic</b> <b>economy</b> at Evendine Court, from which she was expelled after visiting Worcester Cathedral without permission. Accompanied by {{the daughter}} of a canon, Nagle had hired a car for the excursion– {{she was one of the}} first women in Berkshire to hold a driving licence, gaining it when she was fifteen years old. Her education was completed at a finishing school after which she spent some time in Paris, where she became friends with Megan Lloyd George.|$|E

Meanwhile, open <b>domestic</b> <b>economies</b> are susceptible to external shocks such as large short-term capital movements. As a result, we might expect that Indonesia’...|$|R
50|$|International Financial Centers (IFCs)—such as London, New York, and Tokyo—are large {{international}} full-service centers {{with advanced}} settlement and payments systems, supporting large <b>domestic</b> <b>economies,</b> with deep and liquid markets where both the sources and uses of funds are diverse, and where legal and regulatory frameworks are adequate {{to safeguard the}} integrity of principal-agent relationships and supervisory functions.|$|R
50|$|Economic {{interdependence}} {{and greater}} openness exposes <b>domestic</b> <b>economies</b> to {{the exigencies of}} the world market. Social instability is therefore increased by exposure to international competition. This negative force undermines the Kantian peace and remains {{a cause for concern}} in international conflict. Although this concern seems legitimate given the economic disparities between developed and developing countries, studies fail to provide comprehensive empirical evidence.|$|R
25|$|Exports declined, and the <b>domestic</b> <b>economy</b> was depressed. The only segment that {{expanded}} was the subsistence economy. Resources (land, slaves, {{and transport}} animals) made idle by {{the decline of}} the export economy were absorbed into mostly self-consumption activities.|$|E

25|$|Its {{name was}} officially changed to the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in 1960. During the mid-20th century, it was {{restructured}} as {{a provider of}} general higher and vocational education, and pioneered dual sector education in Australia. It also began an engagement with Southeast Asia during this time (under the Australian Government's Colombo Plan).

Therefore, large trade agreements and supranational unions (e.g., the European Union) are used to make policy but this level of politics {{is very hard to}} control with democratic instruments. Globalization additionally endows transnational corporations with more political leverage given their ability to avoid federal regulation and directly affect <b>domestic</b> <b>economies.</b>|$|R

25|$|For {{social and}} {{religious}} reasons, many aspects {{contributed to the}} decline of the Khmer empire. The relationship between the rulers and their elites was unstable – among the 27 Angkorian rulers, eleven lacked a legitimate claim to power, and civil wars were frequent. The Khmer empire focused more on the <b>domestic</b> <b>economy</b> and did not take advantage of the international maritime network. In addition, the input of Buddhist ideas conflicted and disturbed the state order built under the predominant Hinduism.|$|E

25|$|As U.S. President, it was Wilson {{who made}} the key policy {{decisions}} over foreign affairs: while the country was at peace, the <b>domestic</b> <b>economy</b> ran on a laissez-faire basis, with American banks making huge loans to Britain and France — funds that were in large part used to buy munitions, raw materials and food from across the Atlantic. Until 1917, Wilson made minimal preparations for a land war and kept the United States Army on a small peacetime footing, despite increasing demands for enhanced preparedness. He did however expand the United States Navy.|$|E

Highly dependent institutional frameworks were to be restructured, and new obligations were acquired by nations that were once bystanders to the East-West confrontation.|$|R
