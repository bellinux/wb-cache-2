5|$|During {{and after}} the end of World War II, {{scientists}} working on the Manhattan Project and other nuclear weapons research projects conducted studies of the effects of plutonium on laboratory animals and <b>human</b> <b>subjects.</b> Animal studies found that a few milligrams of plutonium per kilogram of tissue is a lethal dose.|$|E
5|$|In early 1943, {{encouraged}} by von Verschuer, Mengele applied {{to transfer to}} the concentration camp service, where he foresaw the opportunity to undertake genetic research on <b>human</b> <b>subjects.</b> His application was accepted, and he was posted to Auschwitz concentration camp. He was appointed by SS-Standortarzt Eduard Wirths, chief medical officer at Auschwitz, {{to the position of}} chief physician of the Zigeunerfamilienlager (Romani family camp), located in the sub-camp at Birkenau.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of <b>human</b> <b>subjects,</b> this {{involved}} injecting solutions containing (typically) five micrograms of plutonium into hospital patients thought to be either terminally ill, or {{to have a life}} expectancy of less than ten years either due to age or chronic disease condition. This was reduced to one microgram in July 1945 after animal studies found that the way plutonium distributed itself in bones was more dangerous than radium. Most of the subjects, Eileen Welsome says, were poor, powerless, and sick.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Human</b> <b>subject</b> {{research}} is systematic, scientific investigation {{that can be}} either interventional (a [...] "trial") or observational (no [...] "test article") and involves human beings as research <b>subjects.</b> <b>Human</b> <b>subject</b> research can be either medical (clinical) research or non-medical (e.g., social science) research. Systematic investigation incorporates both the collection and analysis of data in order to answer a specific question. Medical <b>human</b> <b>subject</b> research often involves analysis of biological specimens, epidemiological and behavioral studies and medical chart review studies. (A specific, and especially heavily regulated, type of medical <b>human</b> <b>subject</b> {{research is}} the [...] "clinical trial", in which drugs, vaccines and medical devices are evaluated.) On the other hand, <b>human</b> <b>subject</b> research {{in the social sciences}} often involves surveys which consist of questions to a particular group of people. Survey methodology includes questionnaires, interviews, and focus groups.|$|R
5|$|Mengele {{received}} doctorates {{in anthropology}} and medicine from Munich University {{and began a}} career as a researcher. He joined the Nazi Party in 1937 and the SS in 1938. Initially assigned as a battalion medical officer at the start of World War II, he was transferred to the concentration camp service in early 1943 and assigned to Auschwitz. There he saw the opportunity to conduct genetic research on <b>human</b> <b>subjects.</b> His subsequent experiments, focusing primarily on twins, had no regard for the health or safety of the victims.|$|E
5|$|Scientist David Banner has {{the idea}} to create super {{soldiers}} by introducing modified DNA sequences extracted from various animals to strengthen the human cellular response, but General Thaddeus Ross denies him permission to use <b>human</b> <b>subjects.</b> Banner subsequently conducts the experiments on himself. After {{the birth of his}} son Bruce, he finds that his son may have inherited the effects and seeks a cure, but is stopped in the process. Following a traumatic event, Bruce remembers nothing of the incident, and has been raised by the Krenzlers. Years later, Bruce is a geneticist working with his girlfriend, Betty Ross, within the Berkeley Biotechnology Institute on nanomed research. The pair hopes to achieve instantaneous cell repair by using low level Gamma radiation exposure to activate the nanomeds once they are introduced into a living organism. During routine maintenance of their appropriated gamma-ray spectrometer, a circuit shorts and triggers the experiment's program sequence. Unable to prevent the machine from firing, Bruce throws himself in front of a colleague to shield the man and is exposed to a massive amount of gamma radiation.|$|E
5|$|Universal {{sold the}} film to PRC for $125,000, which {{represented}} the negative cost plus interest. The transaction occurred around August 1946, but was not made public until it was screened for the trade press on October1, marking its official release date. The sale occurred so quickly and hastily on the copyright files stores at the Library of Congress, the name Universal Pictures was crossed out and Pathe Industries, PRC's corporate body, was written in its place in pencil. Some pressbook advertisements circulated for the film still included the Universal Pictures logo. PRC had previously produced a horror film about acromegaly called The Monster Maker (1944), in which a mad scientist injects <b>human</b> <b>subjects</b> with the disease {{as part of his}} experiments.|$|E

5|$|Neurophysiologists {{study the}} chemical, pharmacological, and {{electrical}} {{properties of the}} brain: their primary tools are drugs and recording devices. Thousands of experimentally developed drugs affect the nervous system, some in highly specific ways. Recordings of brain activity can be made using electrodes, either glued to the scalp as in EEG studies, or implanted inside the brains of animals for extracellular recordings, which can detect action potentials generated by individual neurons. Because the brain does not contain pain receptors, it is possible using these techniques to record brain activity from animals that are awake and behaving without causing distress. The same techniques have occasionally been used to study brain activity in human patients suffering from intractable epilepsy, in cases {{where there was a}} medical necessity to implant electrodes to localize the brain area responsible for epileptic seizures. Functional imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging are also used to study brain activity; these techniques have mainly been used with <b>human</b> <b>subjects,</b> because they require a conscious subject to remain motionless for long periods of time, but they have the great advantage of being noninvasive.|$|E

40|$|A {{device and}} method was {{developed}} to rapidly quantify the relative distention of the bladder of a <b>human</b> <b>subject.</b> An ultrasonic transducer is positioned on the <b>human</b> <b>subject</b> near the bladder. A microprocessor controlled pulser excites the transducer by sending an acoustic wave into the <b>human</b> <b>subject.</b> This wave interacts with the bladder walls and is reflected back to the ultrasonic transducer where it is received, amplified, and processed by the receiver. The resulting signal is digitized by an analog to digital converter, controlled by the microprocessor again, and is stored in data memory. The software in the microprocessor determines the relative distention of the bladder {{as a function of}} the propagated ultrasonic energy. Based on programmed scientific measurements and the <b>human</b> <b>subject's</b> past history as contained in program memory, the microprocessor sends out a signal to turn on any or all of the available alarms.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} the current concepts of <b>human</b> <b>subject</b> as a theoretical methodological basis {{for exploring the}} spatial and temporal characteristics of personal self-fulfillment in vocational educational environment. The <b>human</b> <b>subject</b> {{is regarded as a}} system capable of cognition and conversion of other systems in accordance with the personal logic of functioning and development. The author defines the psychological concept of <b>human</b> <b>subject</b> referring to the indeterminism theory and inner development logic, and broadens  the above concept applying the categories of limitations and limitlessness as a combination of realizable and potential aspects. The methodological bases and existing theoretical concepts of the <b>human</b> <b>subject</b> are given. The main objective involves realization of his temporal and spatial organization. The paper summarizes the ideas of space and time in social and psychological sciences. The categories of self-development and self-fulfillment in psychological time and space are based on the dual subjective perception – i. e. continuity/discreteness, infinity/finiteness. The spatial and temporal characteristics of human existence and self-fulfillment are denoted.   </div...|$|R
40|$|This Brief {{introduces}} {{engineers to}} the main principles in ethics, research design, statistics, and publishing of <b>human</b> <b>subject</b> research. In recent years, engineering has become strongly connected to disciplines such as biology, medicine, and psychology. Often, engineers (and engineering students) are expected to perform <b>human</b> <b>subject</b> research. Typical <b>human</b> <b>subject</b> research topics conducted by engineers include human-computer interaction (e. g., evaluating the usability of software), exoskeletons, virtual reality, teleoperation, modelling of human behaviour and decision making (often {{within the framework of}} ‘big data’ research), product evaluation, biometrics, behavioural tracking (e. g., of work and travel patterns, or mobile phone use), transport and planning (e. g., an analysis of flows or safety issues), etc. Thus, {{it can be said that}} knowledge on how to do <b>human</b> <b>subject</b> research is indispensable for a substantial portion of engineers. Engineers are generally well trained in calculus and mechanics, but may lack the appropriate knowledge on how to do research with human participants. In order to do high-quality <b>human</b> <b>subject</b> research in an ethical manner, several guidelines have to be followed and pitfalls have to be avoided. This book discusses these guidelines and pitfalls. The aim is to prepare engineers and engineering students to carry out independent research in a responsible manner...|$|R
