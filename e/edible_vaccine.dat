30|$|A major {{advantage}} of expression of vaccine antigens in plants {{is that the}} plants can be consumed as raw materials. Thus the vaccine antigens expressed in plants {{can be used for}} oral administration (Jin and Daniell 2015). This potential of plant-based vaccines is vital in cost reduction because the costs related to downstream processing and purification can be circumvented. Production of <b>edible</b> <b>vaccines</b> permits the use of non-processed plant materials that are resistant to digestive enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract due to bioencapsulation through cell wall. Also, <b>edible</b> <b>vaccines</b> administered via oral route can be used to treat autoimmune diseases and to induce oral tolerance to allergens (Sack et al. 2015). An additional {{advantage of}} expression of bioencapsulated pharmaceuticals is the stability of expressed antigens within the plant tissues. In this way, vaccine antigens can be stored at elevated temperatures for longer times and also transported without the need of cooling chain. Vaccine candidates can be expressed in seeds that may remain stable for several years at ambient temperatures and can be effectively delivered to gut-associated lymphoid tissues without degradation because of double packaging into cell wall and protein bodies (Takaiwa 2011; Sack et al. 2015). Thus this strategy may provide additional advantages in terms of storage and cold chain-free delivery of seed-based <b>edible</b> <b>vaccines.</b> However, it is important to assure {{the quality and quantity of}} pharmaceuticals produced in raw plant materials and to prove the antigenic properties of vaccine candidates in animal models.|$|R

The quality of the antibodies, such as avidity, should be considered in evaluating the efficacy of these vaccines. To develop this area, we determined avidity (strength of antibody-antigen binding) of IgG to the capsule of another mucosal pathogen, Streptococcus pneumoniae. Using pneumococcal capsule-specific IgG human monoclonal antibodies (hMAb) cloned from single cells of a subject immunized with pneumococcal vaccine, we defined serotypes specificity and the avidity of these antibodies with ammonium thiocyanate (0, 4 M, 2 M, 1 M 0. 5 M 0. 025 M) dissociation.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the research {{to explore the}} feasibility of plants for oral vaccination. The research focussed on a model of LTB produced in potato tubers or ovalbumin (OVA) as antigen and tested in mice. A general introduction into the backgrounds of oral immunisation is given in Chapter 1. The next two chapters describe the optimisation of an immunisation protocol for edible vaccines by addressing the following questions: can the immune response be increased by more frequent doses of edible vaccines without negative effects on general health (Chapter 2) ?; and can the immune status of the host be modified to react more efficiently to a subsequent oral boost (Chapter 3) ?. Ovalbumin (OVA) was used as model antigen and administered via intragastric (IG) gavage to mice. The results of these studies led to a refined immunisation protocol in which one single subcutaneous, adjuvanted priming is followed three weeks later by oral boost immunisations on three alternating days (also {{referred to as the}} systemic prime/oral boost protocol). As a model for edible vaccines, the heat-labile enterotoxin subunit-B (LTB) of Escherichia coli was produced in potato tubers. This <b>edible</b> <b>vaccine</b> was either fed or administered orally to mice. Using the optimised immunisation protocol, local and systemic responses against LTB were induced (Chapter 4). Subsequently, the use of LTB as adjuvant for co-expressed antigens in edible vaccines was explored. A glycoprotein (E 2) of the classical swine fever virus was co-expressed as fusion protein to LTB or expressed together with LTB in potatoes, resulting in E 2 -LTB and E 2 + LTB potatoes, respectively. LTB fused to these antigens retained its biological activity (GM 1 -binding). The expression levels of LTB varied from 0. 25 % in LTB-transgenic plants to 0. 01 % LTB per total soluble protein in E 2 -LTB-transgenic plants. The levels of LTB as fusion-proteins were lower than those of LTB alone or co-expressed with E 2. LTB, E 2 + LTB, and CVP-LTB producing tubers were immunogenic upon subcutaneous immunisation and significant antibody responses against LTB were detected. The response towards the co-expressed antigens were low or undetectable. Probably, the antigen dose of the co-expressed antigen was too low and the adjuvant capacity of LTB was insufficient (Chapter 5). Further research is required to improve the carrier and adjuvant function of LTB. Another point of concern is that besides adjuvant activity, LT,CT and their B-subunits are also known to be capable to induce oral tolerance. Future research must concentrate on more effective carrier-molecules or adjuvants devoid of tolerating properties. The chapters 4 and 6 clearly demonstrated that IG gavage of tuber or chow extracts induced higher antibody responses than similar doses of antigen taken up with feed or drinking water. It was concluded that the route of oral administration is at least as important than the vaccine composition. The difference between feeding and oral administration {{must be taken into account}} when the feasibility of edible vaccines is assessed (Chapter 6). In Chapter 7, the general findings of this thesis are discussed. The proposed systemic prime/triple dose oral boost protocol appeared to be applicable for oral administration and oral intake of edible vaccines in particular. However, significant adverse effects were observed after tuber intake. The ideal <b>edible</b> <b>vaccine</b> in plants has sufficient levels of antigen, is easy to propagate under a wide range of conditions and is not toxic when given the amounts required. In this respect, the use of potatoes has several drawbacks. Consumption of raw potatoes is not preferable and cooking might denature the antigen.

A 2 fragment containing the coding region of the HN gene from an Indian isolate was cloned into the binary vector pBI 121 and mobilized into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV 3 101. Cotyledonary nodes from germinated seeds of pigeonpea were used for transformation. The presence of transgenes, NPTII and HN in the plants was confirmed by PCR. The expression of HN protein in the transgenic lines was further confirmed by Western blot analysis using polyclonal monospecific antibody to HN and more importantly plant-derived HN protein was shown to be biologically active as demonstrated by neuraminidase activity. Transgenic plants were fertile and PCR of $T_ 1 $ plants confirmed the inheritance of the transgene...|$|E
40|$|Vaccination against anthrax is {{the most}} {{important}} strategy to combat the disease. This study describes a generation of edible transgenic crop expressing, functional protective antigen (PA). In vitro studies showed that the plant-expressed antigen is qualitatively similar to recombinant PA. Immunization studies in mouse animal models indicated the generation of PA-specific neutralizing antibodies and stressed the need for improving expression levels to generate higher antibody titers. Genetic engineering of a plant organelle offers immense scope for increasing levels of antigen expression. An AT-rich PA gene (pagA) coding for the 83 -kDa PA molecule was thus cloned and expressed in tobacco chloroplasts. Biolistics was used for the transformation of a chloroplast genome under a set of optimized conditions. The expression of the pagA gene with 69 % AT content was highly favored by an AT-rich chloroplast genome. A multifold expression level of functional PA was obtained as compared with the nuclear transgenic tobacco plants. This report describes {{for the first time a}} comprehensive study on generating transgenic plants expressing PA, which may serve as a source of an <b>edible</b> <b>vaccine</b> against anthrax. Two important achievements of expressing PA in an edible crop and use of chloroplast technology t...|$|E
40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{vaccine is}} an oral vaccine which given once protects against {{a multitude of}} diseases. Furthermore this ultimate vaccine needs to be very stable and inexpensive to produce. Probably this latter condition can be met only if the vaccines are produced in plants. Such vaccines are called 'edible vaccines'. <b>Edible</b> <b>vaccines</b> can be produced in plants in many ways. Using recombinant plant-virus, CPMV, it was shown that plants can produce massive amounts of chimaeric virus particles which protect after a single injection the target animal against disease. The final step, oral administration, is being addressed at present. Preliminary experiments by others suggest that this step may be solved sooner than expected...|$|R
50|$|Genetic {{engineering}} has {{applications in}} medicine, research, industry and agriculture {{and can be}} used {{on a wide range of}} plants, animals and micro organisms. Bacteria, the first organisms to be genetically modified, can have plasmid DNA inserted containing new genes that code for medicines or enzymes that process food and other substrates. Plants have been modified for insect protection, herbicide resistance, virus resistance, enhanced nutrition, tolerance to environmental pressures and the production of <b>edible</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Most commercialised GMOs are insect resistant and/or herbicide tolerant crop plants. Genetically modified animals have been used for research, model animals and the production of agricultural or pharmaceutical products. The genetically modified animals include animals with genes knocked out, increased susceptibility to disease, hormones for extra growth and the ability to express proteins in their milk.|$|R
40|$|Vaccines {{have played}} an {{important}} role in preventive medicine since Edward Jenner discovered that cowpox induced protection against human smallpox. Until recently, a vaccination has meant a needle in the arm. However, with the increasing need for inexpensive, easily administered vaccines, along with the improvements in genetic engineering, the concept of <b>edible</b> <b>vaccines</b> is fast becoming reality. This is especially important in developing countries, where it is estimated that three to five million children die each year from common diseases, which could have easily been prevented with the proper vaccination. Compared to traditional lab-synthesized vaccines, plants are capable of producing proteins at lower cost, and need not be isolated for injection. Plant-based vaccines are also safer than traditional vaccines because they use selected sub-units of the disease rather the attenuated whole disease-causing organism...|$|R
