5|$|In 1880, Sunday {{relocated}} to Marshalltown, Iowa, where, {{because of his}} athleticism, he had been recruited for a fire brigade team. In Marshalltown, Sunday worked at odd jobs, competed in fire brigade tournaments, and played for the town baseball team. In 1882, with Sunday <b>in</b> <b>left</b> field, the Marshalltown team defeated the state champion Des Moines team 13–4.|$|E

5|$|Bonds {{endured a}} knee injury, {{multiple}} surgeries, and rehabilitation. He was activated on September 12 and started <b>in</b> <b>left</b> field. In his return against the San Diego Padres, he nearly {{hit a home}} run in his first at-bat. Bonds finished the night 1-for-4. Upon his return, Bonds resumed his high-caliber performance at the plate, hitting home runs in four consecutive games from September 18 to 21 and finishing with five homers in only 14 games.|$|E
5|$|Carruthers is left-footed and is versatile, {{being able}} to play as a left back, left wing-back and left midfielder, {{although}} he has stated his strongest position is at left back. He has also played in a more attacking role as a left winger. He predominantly played as a left back for Northampton and Bristol Rovers, but on his arrival at York he was converted to playing <b>in</b> <b>left</b> midfield.|$|E
5|$|Huggins {{continued}} {{to tinker with}} his roster during the offseason. He traded Dugan, Mike Gazella, Rosy Ryan and Pat Collins, and acquired Lyn Lary from the Pacific Coast League. He tried Lary at third base and Leo Durocher at shortstop, while he attempted to acquire George Uhle and Ed Morris, but was unsuccessful in both cases. The Yankees fell behind the Philadelphia Athletics in the standings during the 1929 season and as {{it became clear that}} the Yankees would not win the AL pennant in 1929, Huggins began consulting with coaches Art Fletcher and Bob Shawkey about the future of the team, including how to replace Bob Meusel <b>in</b> <b>left</b> field. However, by August 1929 Huggins began losing weight and complained of feeling ill.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, {{his first}} full season in the majors, Youkilis became a regular first baseman (with 127 games at first). Until that time, he was {{primarily}} a third baseman, though he did play nine games at first base with the Red Sox in 2005, and 56 games at first base in his minor league career. Also in 2006 {{he played in the}} outfield {{for the first time in}} his professional career, 18 games <b>in</b> <b>left</b> field. Despite his inexperience in the outfield, Youkilis did not commit an error while in the outfield; he did, however, commit eight errors while playing the infield.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Ishikawa {{signed with}} the Milwaukee Brewers, who used him mainly as a pinch-hitter and {{defensive}} replacement. Ishikawa spent most of 2013 in the minor leagues, though he played six games for the Baltimore Orioles and one game for the New York Yankees. In 2014, he made the Pittsburgh Pirates Opening Day roster. However his bat wasn't as hot as it was during Spring Training so the Pirates traded for 1B Ike Davis from the New York Mets and Ishikawa was designated for assignment. He was re-signed by his former team the San Francisco Giants in April and started for them <b>in</b> <b>left</b> field during the 2014 playoffs. On October 16, 2014, Ishikawa hit a walk-off three-run home run to give the Giants their third National League pennant in five years by defeating the St. Louis Cardinals.|$|E
5|$|Ishikawa {{signed a}} minor league deal with the Giants on April 24. After languishing in the minors for several months, Ishikawa again {{considered}} retirement, but the Giants promoted him to the major leagues on July 29 after ongoing injuries to first baseman Brandon Belt and a roster re-shuffle following a six-game losing streak. In late September, {{with the return of}} Belt to first base and ongoing injuries to outfielders Michael Morse and Ángel Pagán, the Giants asked Ishikawa to play left field {{for the first time in}} his career. Despite being a career first baseman and with just three career regular season starts <b>in</b> <b>left</b> field, Ishikawa became the Giants starting left fielder during the 2014 postseason.|$|E

5|$|Larry Schmittou {{sold his}} {{majority}} {{interest in the}} Sounds to Al Gordon, president of AmeriSports Companies LLC, before the 1997 season. The new ownership group refurbished every area of the stadium, including the concession stands, bathrooms, concourse, stadium exterior, home clubhouse (a visitor's clubhouse had been built under the third base bleachers for the 1996 season), and parking lots. Several sections of bleachers <b>in</b> <b>left</b> field past third base were removed and replaced by tents and a group picnic area. This brought the seating capacity to 11,500.|$|E
5|$|Nevin {{suffered}} a dislocated shoulder {{in spring training}} in 2003 while making a diving catch. He had surgery on his left shoulder {{and returned to the}} Padres in June. The Padres acquired Rondell White to replace Nevin, and White went on to have an All-Star season <b>in</b> <b>left</b> field. Ryan Klesko filled in at first base and rookie Sean Burroughs played well at third base, Nevin's favorite position. Nevin offered to be used in a utility role, alternating with White, Klesko, and Burroughs, as well as Xavier Nady in right field. In 2004, Nevin had more than 100 RBI {{for the third time in}} his career, but underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair torn cartilage in his right knee in July.|$|E
5|$|Once again, the Red Sox {{took the}} lead in the first inning when Ramírez hit a home run off former Red Sox pitcher Jeff Suppan.

Edmonds then hit a fly ball towards Ramírez <b>in</b> <b>left</b> field, who caught it on the run and threw to catcher Jason Varitek at home plate. Varitek tagged out Walker, who was attempting to score from third, ending the inning.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} has been well-received by critics, with Ellie's relationship with Joel most frequently {{the subject of}} praise. The strength and complexity of her character, and its subversion of the damsel in distress stereotype, have also been commended. Ellie's role <b>in</b> <b>Left</b> Behinds plot has prompted some social commentary within the industry, with coverage focusing on a scene depicting LGBT themes. Both the character and Johnson's performance received numerous awards and nominations, and have regularly been placed favorably in polls and lists.|$|E
5|$|The {{off-season}} the Phillies promoted {{assistant general}} manager Rubén Amaro, Jr. to general manager, succeeding Pat Gillick who retired {{at the end of}} a three-year contract. Their most notable offseason player change was <b>in</b> <b>left</b> field, as Pat Burrell departed due to free agency and was replaced by free agent Raúl Ibañez. Another notable acquisition was free agent pitcher Chan Ho Park. Park was originally signed as a backup option for the bullpen, as reliever J. C. Romero was assigned a 50-game suspension after violating the Major League Baseball drug policy, but Park won the fifth starter's job in Spring Training.|$|E
5|$|There was {{considerable}} attention as Ruth reported for spring training. He did not hit his first home {{run of the}} spring until after the team had left Florida, and was beginning the road north in Savannah. He hit two in an exhibition against the Bears. Amid much press attention, Ruth played his first home game in Boston in over 16 years. Before an opening-day crowd of over 25,000, including five of New England's six state governors, Ruth accounted {{for all of the}} Braves' runs in a 4–2 defeat of the New York Giants, hitting a two-run home run, singling to drive in a third run and later in the inning scoring the fourth. Although age and weight had slowed him, he made a running catch <b>in</b> <b>left</b> field that sportswriters deemed the defensive highlight of the game.|$|E

5|$|Though {{the stadium}} was opened on time, the late sod {{was not the}} only issue on opening day. The stadium's seats, which had {{previously}} been installed in Atlanta's Fulton County Stadium, arrived just in time. Construction of the backstop was still being completed on opening day. Players for both the Sounds and the visiting Braves had concerns about the safety of playing on the quickly installed infield, initially refusing to even play on the surface. Left fielders complained about the extra-steep slope <b>in</b> <b>left</b> field that prevented them from seeing home plate. Only two women's restrooms and one men's restroom were functioning; a few portable toilets were also available.|$|E
5|$|A {{free agent}} in March 2001, Henderson {{returned}} to the Padres. During the 2001 season, he broke three major league career records and reached an additional major career milestone. He broke Babe Ruth's record of 2,062 career walks, Ty Cobb's record of 2,245 career runs, and Zack Wheat's record of 2,328 career games <b>in</b> <b>left</b> field, and {{on the final day}} of the season collected his 3,000th career hit, a leadoff double off Rockies pitcher John Thomson. That final game was also Padre Tony Gwynn's last major league game, and Henderson had originally wanted to sit out so as not to detract from the occasion, but Gwynn insisted that Henderson play. After scoring the game's first run, Henderson was removed from the lineup. With Gwynn having 3,141 hits, it was just the second time in Major League history that a pair of teammates each had 3,000 career hits; Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker had previously played many games together for the 1928 A's.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Mayberry {{was rated}} by Baseball America as the Best Athlete and Best Outfield Arm among all Texas Rangers minor leaguers. In 2006 he was rated by Baseball America as the Best Power Hitter, Best Athlete, and Best Outfield Arm among all Texas Rangers minor leaguers, {{and was named}} a Hawaii Winter Baseball league post-season All Star. In 2007, he hit 30 home runs (tied for 11th among all minor leaguers), was named a California League mid-season All Star, and was named an Arizona Fall League Rising Star. On November 20, 2008, the Philadelphia Phillies traded for him. With the Phillies, he started in Triple-A, and was called up to the major league team in May. He {{hit a home run}} in his major league debut, but was sent back to the minors a few weeks later, and spent the {{majority}} of the 2009 and 2010 seasons there. He was named an MiLB.com 2010 Phillies Organization All Star. He returned to the major league squad in 2010 as a September callup, and remained there, {{with the exception of a}} short stint in Triple-A in 2011. In 2011, Mayberry played over 100 games, splitting time between outfield and first base, as well as pinch hitting. Statistically, 2011 was his best major league season. He remained with the big-league club in 2012, and played predominantly <b>in</b> <b>left</b> field early in the season, and subsequently as the team's everyday center fielder. In 2012 and 2013 his batting average declined.|$|E
