25|$|The {{rate of unionization}} {{for these}} workers is about 36 percent, {{much higher than the}} average for all occupations. Consequently, {{merchant}} marine officers and seamen, both veterans and beginners, are hired for voyages through union hiring halls or directly by shipping companies. Hiring halls rank the candidates by the length of time the person <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> work and fill open slots accordingly. Hiring halls typically are found in major seaports.|$|E
25|$|A {{link with}} the Metropolitan and District lines was made just south of Whitechapel via St Mary's Curve.

The curve can easily be seen on the northbound and eastbound approaches to Whitechapel station, although a temporary wall was built across the line in January 2008, close to the junction with the District line..|$|E

25|$|The Copts {{are one of}} {{the oldest}} Christian {{communities}} in the Middle East. Although integrated in the larger Egyptian nation state, the Copts have survived as a distinct religious community forming around 10 to 20 percent of the population, though estimates vary. They pride themselves on the apostolicity of the Egyptian Church whose founder was the first in an unbroken chain of patriarchs. The main body for 16 centuries <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> communion with both the Roman Catholic Church (in Rome) and the various Eastern orthodox churches.|$|E
25|$|In the CMWU damage {{assessment}} report, waste water networks in Gaza City, Beit Hanoun, Jabalia, and Beit Lahia have sustained severe damage. The Ash Sheikh 'Ijleen sewage plant which treats the raw sewage {{of an area}} inhabited by 400,000 people <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> order since it {{was struck by a}} shell in the second week of the conflict. The final report of the {{damage assessment}} carried out by the CMWU reveals that repairing the water and wastewater network and facilities will cost approximately 6 million US dollars, including 830,000 dollars to repair the wastewater network. According to the Palestinian Hydrology Group, solid waste is accumulating in most areas affected by the hostilities, with the exception of Gaza city where only two areas face problems with solid waste. The group also reported that on 13 February, 3,000 litres of fuel had leaked into wastewater infiltration basin of the Beit Lahia emergency wastewater treatment plant, posing a risk for chemical contamination of the aquifer by hydrocarbons. Major repairs can not take place without the entry of needed spare parts into Gaza, which remains problematic.|$|E
25|$|However, {{this success}} rate {{can only be}} {{achieved}} with the institution of optimum care within fifteen {{minutes to an hour}} of the accident. In the case of knocked-out teeth, being prepared and knowing what to do {{can mean the difference between}} a person retaining or losing replanted knocked-out teeth for life. Teeth that have been knocked out when they are fully matured, that is, when the root has completely formed, have a much better prognosis than those teeth that are immature and not fully formed. This is due to the fragility of the root. When teeth have not fully formed, the walls of the root are thinner and thus more fragile. Another complication for the prognosis is the length of time that the tooth <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> its socket. Teeth that are replanted within fifteen minutes of the accident have an excellent prognosis. Teeth that have been extra-oral and dry stored for more than one hour have a poor prognosis. Teeth that have been placed in an optimal storage medium within one hour of the accident also have an excellent prognosis. All teeth that have been knocked out should be replanted but watched carefully for the development of root resorption. Teeth that do not have root canal treatment within two weeks of replantation also have a poor prognosis.|$|E

500|$|Staunton {{introduced}} the Staunton Gambit against the Dutch Defense (1.d4 f5 2.e4!?). Although {{it was once}} a feared attacking line, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> favour since the mid-1920s, and is thought to [...] "offer White equality at best". Staunton also analysed a different gambit approach to the Dutch, 2.h3 followed by g4. In 1979 Viktor Korchnoi, one of the world's leading players, successfully introduced this line into top-class competition, but later authorities concluded, as Staunton had, that Black gets a good game with 2...Nf6 3.g4 d5! ...|$|E
500|$|On January 6, 2006, just a {{few days}} after the Gator Bowl, Virginia Tech {{officials}} dismissed Vick from the Virginia Tech football team, citing a December 17 traffic stop in which Vick was cited for speeding and driving with a revoked or suspended license. Vick hid the information from the team and the infraction was not discovered until January. The traffic stop, an earlier suspension from the team, and his unsportsmanlike conduct during the 2005 ACC Championship Game and 2006 Gator Bowl were used as grounds for his dismissal. In response to being dismissed from the team, Vick was quoted as saying, [...] "It's not a big deal. I'll just move on to the next level, baby". Vick appeared in one regular-season NFL game for the Miami Dolphins in 2006. The Dolphins did not renew his contract, and he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> football ever since.|$|E
500|$|In {{a broader}} sense, [...] "Western Wall" [...] {{can refer to}} the entire 488-metre-long (1,601ft.) {{retaining}} wall {{on the western side}} of the Temple Mount. The classic portion now faces a large plaza in the Jewish Quarter, near the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount, {{while the rest of the}} wall is concealed behind structures in the Muslim Quarter, with the small exception of a 25ft (8m) section, the so-called Little Western Wall. The segment of the Western retaining wall traditionally used for Jewish liturgy, known as the [...] "Western Wall", derives its particular importance to it having never been fully obscured by medieval buildings, and displaying much more of the original Herodian stonework than the [...] "Little Western Wall". In religious terms, the [...] "Little Western Wall" [...] is presumed to be even closer to the Holy of Holies and thus to the [...] "presence of God" [...] (Shechina), and the underground Warren's Gate, which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> reach since the 12th century, even more so.|$|E

500|$|As {{the three}} summer interns prepare to depart, Michael (Steve Carell) hears from {{various members of}} the office that two of the interns might be dating, and feels upset that he was left out of the gossip. He talks about the {{situation}} with the third intern, and learns that the interns had recently gone out to a young people's club, where they saw Stanley (Leslie David Baker) dancing with a woman, presumably his wife Teri. Michael, wanting to start some gossip of his own, forms the conclusion that Stanley was out because he was having a mid-life crisis and shares it with the office, but Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) claims Stanley does not like crowds and that Teri is out of town. When Michael confronts the interns about this, they insist they saw Stanley there [...] "making out" [...] with a woman. Now realizing that Stanley is possibly having an affair and he is the first person to learn of it, Michael starts telling the employees. Jim (John Krasinski) urges Michael to stop spreading a rumor that he does not know for certain to be true. When Stanley is leaving, Michael heads to the parking lot to discuss the rumor with him. Stanley initially denies it, but when Michael mentions that he was spotted in the club by the interns, he reveals that since Teri <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> town constantly, he has been seeking company from a nurse named Cynthia, whom he met in rehab. Stanley urges Michael not to say anything since he is breaking it off with Cynthia, and Michael agrees, despite having already told the entire office.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Brian <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> town {{attending}} {{a seminar on}} creating a web series and is unaware of what has transpired. On his way home, Brian stops at the Marriott, meets Ida, and starts having drinks with her. Quickly bonding, they retire to Ida's room for sex, with Ida leaving first, then Brian after telling the barman to bill the drinks to her room. The next morning, Brian shares his newfound love with Peter and Lois before showing them a picture of Ida on his cellphone. Peter and Lois go into hysterics, while Brian, unaware of Ida's operation, believes they are just jealous. After Stewie tells him that Quagmire's father has had a sex change and reveals Ida's name, Brian realizes {{that he has had}} sex with Quagmire's transgendered father and vomits for almost 30 uninterrupted seconds before the two of them panic. At the same time, Ida returns to Quagmire's home and apologizes, and Quagmire returns the favor, reconciling their relationship. Ida tells Quagmire that she met someone, and when she says it was Brian, whom Quagmire despises, he becomes furious. Brian is traumatized for no reason after finding out about Ida and, when he hears Quagmire come inside the house, he tries to hide under Peter and Lois' bed, but Quagmire finds him easily, because Brian's feet were sticking out from under the bed, and brutally beats him, thus threatening to blow his head off if he goes near Quagmire's house. Brian gets the final word — [...] "Hey, I fucked your dad." [...] — and angrily slams the door shut.|$|E
