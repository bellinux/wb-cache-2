It was later revealed that Robson and an editor, John Lockert, had removed four substantial scenes from the final cut, including an extended conclusion. In spite of its mixed reception, the film became a cult film in England, noted by critics for its homoerotic undertones.|$|E

In his 2008 book on the Natchez revolt, Arnaud Balvay wrote that more likely than not, the conspiracy claim was false because of <b>incoherence</b> in primary sources.|$|E
5|$|In {{his major}} {{theoretical}} statement, 'Opera and Drama' (1852), Wagner {{objected to the}} music of Meyerbeer, asserting its superficiality and <b>incoherence</b> in dramatic terms; this work contains Wagner's well-known put-down of Meyerbeer's operas as 'effects without causes'. It also contains the sardonic crack that ' never could have dreamt that it would some day occur to the Bankers, for whom he had always made their music, to make it for themselves'. 'Jewishness in Music' was reissued in 1869, (after Meyerbeer's death) in an extended form, with a far more explicit attack on Meyerbeer. This version was under Wagner's own name – and as Wagner had by now a far greater reputation, his views obtained far wider publicity. These attacks on Meyerbeer (which also included swipes at Felix Mendelssohn) are regarded by Paul Lawrence Rose as a significant milestone in the growth of German anti-Semitism.|$|E

Si la coherencia de sentido entre texto e imagen desaparece en el doblaje, el objetivo de verosimilitud no se satisface. En este trabajo analizo y clasifico las incoherencias texto-imagen y aporto posibles soluciones a este recurrente problema. When dubbing {{audio-visual}} products, translators {{must take}} into account the interactionbetween the oral and the visual channels, as both of them convey information at thesame time. It is sometimes difficult to maintain the original coherence between text andimage (due to wordplay, for instance), and the dubbed version ends up making no sense. This has negative consequences on the audience because they realise they are watchinga translation and that it could actually be wrong. Hence, {{the purpose of this paper}} is tofind out what causes the appearance of such <b>incoherences</b> and give some generalsolutions or strategies to prevent them. To do so, I have analysed specific examples oftext-image <b>incoherences</b> in the Spanish version of The Simpsons, as this animationseries often transmits information and humour through the visual channel. The results ofmy work are a classification of the different types of text-image <b>incoherences</b> (basedupon the several restrictions imposed by the image) and a reflection on the importanceof avoiding them to improve the quality of dubbed versions. In some cases I proposeadaptations of the text to solve <b>incoherences,</b> but in other examples visual restrictionsmake such adaptations almost impossible, which leads me to the conclusion that digitalmanipulation of the image is sometimes necessary. Future studies could broaden thescope of my work by analysing more examples of text-image <b>incoherences</b> in otherseries and films: this could help improve my classification of them and give furthersolutions to this recurrent problem...|$|R
5|$|The literary, {{as well as}} the historical, {{value of}} the Historia Augusta has {{suffered}} greatly {{as a result of the}} method of its composition. In the arrangement in categories of the historical material, the authors did but follow the accepted principles of the art of biography as practised in antiquity, but their narratives, consisting often of mere excerpts arranged without regard to connexion or transition, lack grace and even cohesion. The over-emphasis of personal details and the introduction of anecdotal material destroy the proportion of many sections, and the insertion of forged documents interrupts the course of the narrative, without adding anything of historical value or even of general interest. Finally, the later addition of lengthy passages and brief notes, frequently in paragraphs with the general content of which they have no connexion, has put the crowning touch to the awkwardness and <b>incoherence</b> of the whole, with the result that the oft-repeated charge seems almost justified, that these biographies are little more than literary monstrosities.|$|E

A common kind of error in ontology evolution is the logical contradiction declined as <b>incoherences</b> and inconsistences. In this paper, we propose a new approach to predict and identify the <b>incoherences</b> and inconsistences in the evolution of ontologies based on temporal logic and ontology design patterns. We implement the proposed approach using the NuSMV model checker. Based on these patterns, we propose an automated process to guide and monitor the implementation of change while ensuring the consistency of the evolved ontology...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the feature interaction {{problem in the}} research area of telephone systems design. We start with a review of this problem and present our definition of a feature and of a feature interaction. We enumerate and discuss some known approaches {{with respect to their}} strengths and limitations. We present our initial approach and propose some refinements in order to automate the detection of <b>incoherences</b> and derivation of validation scenarios at the design stage using predicate logic and Prolog. The identification of <b>incoherences</b> corresponding to potential feature interactions allows the designer to refine the requirements and to produce a better specification. A UCM model is derived from requirements. This model allows the designers to have a general {{point of view of the}} system and to detect design defaults. The construction of the UCM model is followed by the generation of a LOTOS specification. The derivation of validation test suites and their application against the specification permits to check whether or not the <b>incoherences</b> identified in the requirements lead to feature interactions. The results obtained over two case studies show that the application of this approach improves the design and validation of a specification...|$|R

Avoiding the <b>incoherences</b> requires making some sacrifices: For example, we must require the decision functions to be independent of interactive information, and, the language in which the states are described must be “rich” - in some well-defined sense. Using weak additional assumptions, we also extend all previous results to allow agents to base their decisions on possibly false information. Finally, we provide agreement theorems in which the decision functions are not required to satisfy the Sure-Thing Principle (a central assumption in the standard results). ...|$|R

Outside of the linguistics aspect of research David Rigler did not clearly define any parameters for the scope of the study, and both the extremely high volume and <b>incoherence</b> of the research team's data left the scientists unable to determine the importance of much of the information they collected. After the initial grant and a one-year extension Rigler proposed an additional three-year extension, and the NIMH's grants committee acknowledged that the study had clearly benefited Genie but concluded that the research team had not adequately addressed their concerns. In a unanimous decision the committee denied the extension request, cutting off further funding.|$|E
