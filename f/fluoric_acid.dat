500|$|Hydrofluoric acid {{was used}} in glass etching from 1720 onwards. Andreas Sigismund Marggraf first {{characterized}} it in 1764 when he heated fluorite with sulfuric acid, and the resulting solution corroded its glass container. Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele repeated the experiment in 1771, and named the acidic product fluss-spats-syran (fluorspar acid). In 1810, the French physicist André-Marie Ampère suggested that hydrogen and an element analogous to chlorine constituted hydrofluoric acid. Sir Humphry Davy proposed that this then-unknown substance be named fluorine from <b>fluoric</b> <b>acid</b> and the -ine suffix of other halogens. This word, with modifications, is used in most European languages; Greek, Russian, and some others (following Ampère's suggestion) use the name ftor or derivatives, from the Greek φθόριος (phthorios, destructive) [...] The New Latin name fluorum gave the element its current symbol F; Fl {{was used in}} early papers.|$|E
40|$|Porous silicon (por-Si) has {{a unique}} {{combination}} of physicochemical parameters: well-developed surface and hence high sorption. Depending on technology {{it is possible to}} form nanometer size pores and clusters in porous silicon which makes this material promising for developments in the field of optoelectronics and sensors. However the high surface activity makes por-Si unstable when exposed to atmosphere. In this work we have studied the effect of por-Si surface treatment in a polyacrylic acid water solution on the composition and photoluminescence (PL) of the material. Por-Si was produced from two <b>fluoric</b> <b>acid</b> solutions. One was a standard solution of <b>fluoric</b> <b>acid,</b> isopropyl alcohol and hydrogen peroxide, and the other was a mixture of <b>fluoric</b> <b>acid</b> and dimethylformamide. We have shown that depending on por-Si technology, its treatment in polyacrylic acid solution allows increasing and stabilizing por-Si PL or changing PL band position and significantly increasing its integral intensity...|$|E

The surface modification of Si 3 N 4 powders with <b>fluoric</b> <b>acid</b> strongly influences the surface {{charge of the}} powders in aqueous suspension (indicated by acoustophoretic measurements). For example the isoelectric point of the Si 3 N 4 powder SN E 10 (UBE) is shifted from pH equal 5, 9 for the as-received powder to pH equal 8, 5 for the same powder treated with <b>fluoric</b> <b>acid.</b> The oxygen content of this powder is reduced from 1, 26 to 0, 67 weight percent. Furthermore the influence of PVA-binder on the surface charge and the viscosity of aqueous Si 3 N 4 suspensions is investigated...|$|E

40|$|Calcium {{phosphates}} coatings were deposited onto {{titanium alloy}} discs via en electrodeposition method. Titanium alloy discs were blasted with calcium phosphate particles, then etched {{in a mixture}} of nitric and <b>fluoric</b> <b>acids</b> and rinsed in demineralized water. The titanium alloy disc (cathode) and platinum mesh (anode) were immersed in a supersaturated calcium phosphate electrolyte buffered at pH 7. 4 and connected to a current generator. The microstructure, chemical composition and crystallinity of the electrodeposited coatings were studied as function of time 10 - 120 min, temperature 25 - 80 degrees C, current density 8 - 120 mA/cm(2), magnesium and hydrogen carbonate amounts (0. 1 - 1 mM). Uniform calcium phosphate coatings were obtained in 30 min but coating thickness increased with deposition time. Raising the temperature of electrolyte resulted in more uniform coatings as ionic mobility increased. Low current density was preferable due to hydrogen gas evolving at the cathode, which disturbed the deposition of calcium phosphate crystals on titanium. The amounts of magnesium and hydrogen carbonate ions affected both the homogeneity and morphology of the coatings. This study showed that the electrodeposition method is efficient for coating titanium with osteoconductive calcium phosphate layers...|$|R
40|$|Trace {{concentrations}} of boron in rocks may cause essential rise of neutron absorption of rocks thus changing {{the results of}} interpretation for porosity. The boron in 48 rock samples was chemically assayed and its correlation with Σa plotted. The commonly used method of boron assay was insufficiently accurate and a better method was devised. Using this method a clear cut almost linear dependence of Σa on boron content was observed. Recently Woznicka [1] has shown, in an indirect way, {{the possibility that the}} high boron content is probably the source of thermal neutron absorption cross-section (Σa) rise in samples from Miocene layers in Tarnogrod area (South eastern Poland). Small {{concentrations of}} boron of order of 100 ppm may cause an essential rise of Σa value by 60 to 100 % (Woznicka [2]). The change of the value of Σa by 10 capture units (1 c. u. = 10 - 3 cm- 1) will cause a shift in apparent porosity by 5 to 6 porosity percent during porosity interpretation in sandstones and dolomites according to Zorski et al [3]. Therefore the boron concentration may have an important influence on the assessment of reservoir properties of a rock formation and in consequence on the perspective of its exploitation. We have preformed boron content analysis on samples from Jordanow area and also for a small amount of Miocene samples from Tarnogrod area. The samples have been used before in another research project and are described more extensively in the paper by Loskiewicz et al [4]. From this study also the values of Σa are taken. The problem of dissolving the rock samples without loss of its boron was one of main difficulties of the study. The first approach, in current use in many geological laboratories, is to dissolve the rock samples in a mixture of sulfuric and <b>fluoric</b> <b>acids</b> at room temperature...|$|R

As received powder was rinsed with hydro <b>fluoric</b> <b>acid</b> to remove surface oxide layer and followed with oxidation treatment. The ∆Ηimm was measured for each oxidation stage. The immersion medium was water. The results of ∆Himm measurement show that oxide layer developed at the early stage of oxidation was crystalline silica and then it converged to amorphous silica after further oxidation...|$|E
40|$|An {{electroless}} Ni-P plating on aluminum pad {{has been}} mainly used. A zincate method has also mainly used to initiate electroless Ni-P plating. However, the zincate solution is strong alkaline solution. Therefore, other milder solution is requested. Our previous papers have described possibility of direct electroless Ni-P plating without using the zincate method. Moreover, a fluoric acid(HF) is also {{commonly used to}} remove the passive films. The <b>fluoric</b> <b>acid</b> is not appropriate {{from the viewpoint of}} environmental concern. This paper also reported new etching solution without using <b>fluoric</b> <b>acid.</b> This etching solution was performed by two steps, first investigation was used pure Al and second investigation using actual wafer after conventional semiconductor process. In this investigation, 4 inorganic acids, HCl, H 2 SO 4, HNO 3 and H 3 PO 4, and their mixing solutions were investigated. Only by using the mixture of HNO 3 and H 3 PO 4 solution, enough adhesion strength between Al and electroless deposited Ni-P film was obtained. The aluminum surface before and etching were observed by scanning electron microscopy(SEM), atomic force microscopy(AFM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPS). The aluminum surface that etched with mixture of HNO 3 and H 3 PO 4 solution showed as same as the surface etched by HF. Accordingly, the effect of mixture etching solution was evaluated to Al pad of actual wafer. To obtain a good adhesion, removing fluorine is necessary and this mixing solution shows high ability of removing fluorine from the Al substrate. Therefore, it is concluded that etching by mixture of HNO 3 and H 3 PO 4 solution and following the electroless Ni-P plating is environmental friendly method for obtains a good adhesion...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of the powder properties and the processing conditions on the ceramic material properties are discussed with respect to silicon nitride ceramics. The surface of several Si 3 N 4 -powders can be modified by treatment with <b>fluoric</b> <b>acid.</b> The isoelectric point shifts from a pH range between 5, 0 and 6, 3 for the starting powders to a pH range between 8, 2 and 8, 7 for the acid treated powders. The changed surface chemical properties of the powders influence the adsorption of the deflocculant and thus the viscosity of aqueous slips. A comparison of several processing routes shows that the mechanical strength of the sintered material can by increased by optimum use of the electrokinetic principles for the stabilization of the suspension (pH, deflocculant) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{technique}} of chemical etching for fabrication of near perfect optical fiber nanoprobe (NNP). It uses photosensitive single mode optical fiber to etch in hydro <b>fluoric</b> (HF) <b>acid</b> solution. The difference in etching rate for cladding and photosensitive core in HF acid solution creates capillary ring along core-cladding boundary under a given condition. The capillary ring {{is filled with}} acid solution due to surface tension and capillary action. Finally it creates near perfect symmetric tip {{at the apex of}} the fiber as the height of the acid level in capillary ring decreases while width of the ring increases with continuous etching. Typical tip features are short taper length (~ 4 µm), large cone angle (~ 38 °), and small probe tip dimension (< 100 nm). A finite difference time domain (FDTD) analysis is also presented to compare near field optics of the NNP with conventional nanoprobe (CNP). The probe may be ideal for near field optical imaging and sensor applications...|$|R
30|$|Following the {{treatments}} on {{the backside of}} the Si wafers, vertically aligned SiNWs were grown {{on the other side}} (front side) of the Si wafers by the metal-assisted chemical etching method. This involved the electroless deposition of Ag particles in AgNO 3 /HF solution and subsequent Ag-assisted etching in the same solution. During the chemical etching process, the backside of the Si wafers with Al 2 O 3 or Al layers was protected using a Teflon container. In the typical process, the etchant containing silver ions (Ag+, 0.02 M) and <b>fluoric</b> <b>acid</b> (HF, 5.0 M) was used for the growth of SiNWs. Etching time was controlled at 3 and 5 min to obtain SiNWs of desired dimension at 50 °C. After etching, the as-prepared samples were immersed in 50 % conc. HNO 3 and 5 % conc. HF, successively, to remove residual Ag particles and SiO 2. Finally, the samples were rinsed with deionized water and dried at room temperature in a smooth nitrogen flux.|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{a method}} has been {{developed}} to determine the concentration of 30 elements in Roman bricks from the province Germania Superior in order to compare them with the concentrations measured with XRF. As the matrix of bricks is hard to dissolve, the best conditions for a complete digestion had to be found. The microwave assisted digestion using conc. nitric acid, perchloric acid and <b>fluoric</b> <b>acid</b> {{was found to be}} the most effective method that can even be used for high sample throughput. To remove <b>fluoric</b> <b>acid</b> the solution was evaporated afterwards and the residue was dissolved in 2 % nitric acid. In {{order to be able to}} measure the solutions with both ICP-OES and ICP-MS, an online dilution method using a cell which contains a block of pressed PTFE as a mixing unit was developed, so that the sample solution could be diluted with tridestilled water without any contact with the environment. No memory effect could be observed. A dilution factor of 258 could be achieved by connecting a smaller cell with a bigger one. The dilution procedure was automated by coupling the cell with an Autosampler. The concentrations determined with ICP were compared to the XRF results of G. Schneider to show that it is possible to assign measurements of new brick samples statistically to the groups formed by 600 reference samples determined with XRF. The concentrations of SiO 2, TiO 2, Al 2 O 3, Fe 2 O 3, MnO, MgO, CaO, Na 2 O, K 2 O, Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Nb, Ba, La, Ce, Pb and Th were used for the comparison. It could also be shown that the composition of the investigated bricks is not changed significantly by cleaning them with 24 % technical hydrochloric acid as usually done by archaeologists. All the samples were grouped statistically dependent of their similarity of properties like color, element composition etc. Different statistical methods like Ward dendrogram, centroid clustering and two-step clustering were compared with one another. Also different methods to standardize the results were tested, so that major, minor and trace elements could be used simultaneously in the statistical evaluation. Moreover, 58 samples from the Roman theatre in Mainz could be allocated to the military brick works. </p...|$|E
40|$|Silicon is an {{indirect}} band gap material and therefore its luminescent properties are poor. For very small dimensions however, as in a nanocrystal {{of a few}} nano meter diameter, luminescence becomes strong and blue shifted due quantum confinement. The topic of this thesis is Photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) and the spatial and size distribution of silicon nanocrystals. A main object was to correlate size with their light emitting properties which {{would be subject to}} quantum confinement. The nanocrystals were produced by ion implantation of 28 Si+ ions in thermally grown silicon dioxide which was followed by annealing at 1100 ◦C in nitrogen atmosphere. As a first approach three different oversaturations of silicon atoms in SiO 2 were investigated. The size of the nanocrystals and there distance to each other were characterised with an atomic force microscope (AFM). The effects of the different oversaturations were studied with AFM as well as with PL. Additionally, the samples were etched with hydro <b>fluoric</b> <b>acid</b> in order to remove the oxide matrix such that individua...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Industrialization {{coupled with}} urbanizaton {{has led to}} stress in the Buckingham Canal which runs {{parallel}} to Bay of Bengal {{at a distance of}} around 1 km from the coastline. 4 sediment cores were collected along Ennore – Pulicat stretch to determine acid leachable trace metal concentration. Core samples were collected using gravity corer. The cores were sliced horizontally at 2. 5 cm to determine the grain size, sediment composition, pH, organic matter, calcium carbonate, acid leachable trace metals; cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, zinc. The trace metals were extracted using acid mixture containing hydro <b>fluoric</b> <b>acid,</b> nitric acid and sulphuric acid and analysed by atomic emission spectrophotometer. In an attempt to infer anthropogenic input from geogenic input, several approaches including comparison with sediment quality guidelines – ecotoxicological sense of heavy metal contamination and classification by quantitative indexes such as geoaccumalation index, anthropogenic factor, enrichment factor, contamination factor and degree and pollution load index was attempted. Grain size analysis and sediment composition of core samples shows Ennore is sandy in nature having a neutral pH. Organic matter enrichment is observed to a higher extent in core 3. Core 2 at a depth of 5 cm shows organic matter of 9. 4 %. calcium carbonate is totally absent at the surface sediments in core 2. Cores collected within the canal showed a higher heavy metal concentration than the cores collected from Pulicat lagoon and 2 km into the Ennore Sea. The trace metal concentration for cadmium, lead and zinc in Ennore does not pose a threat to the sediment dwelling fauna whereas chromium and copper are likely to pose a threat. Quantitative indexes place Ennore under moderately polluted. Ennore is likely to face a serious threat of metal pollution with the present deposition rates unless stringent pollution control norms are adopted...|$|E
