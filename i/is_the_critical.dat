5|$|Feminist {{economics}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> {{study of}} economics including its methodology, epistemology, history and empirical research, attempting to overcome androcentric (male and patriarchal) biases. It focuses on topics of particular relevance to women, such as care work or occupational segregation (exclusion {{of women and}} minorities from certain fields); deficiencies of economic models, such as disregarding intra-household bargaining; new forms of data collection and measurement such as the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM), and more gender-aware theories such as the capabilities approach. Feminist economics ultimately seeks to produce a more gender inclusive economics.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} phase of decompression, the {{critical}} event {{is assumed to}} be the presence of a large bubble that has taken up a large quantity of dissolved gas from the adjacent tissue in a joint. If the bubble reaches a critical volume, it will have a mechanical effect on the nerve endings causing pain in a tendon. The bubble volume <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> parameter. This criterion is used to prevent type I pain-only symptoms. The strategy for a safe ascent at this stage is to prevent any gas phase from growing beyond a critical volume.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of nearest {{neighbor}} interactions, E. Ising provided an exact solution of the model. At any positive temperature (i.e. finite β) the free energy is analytic in the thermodynamics parameters and the truncated two-point spin correlation decays exponentially fast. At zero temperature, (i.e. infinite β), {{there is a second}} order phase transition: the free energy is infinite and the truncated two point spin correlation does not decay (remains constant). Therefore, T = 0 <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> temperature of this case. Scaling formulas are satisfied.|$|E
25|$|If {{civilian}} control <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> variable for military effectiveness, {{it raises the}} question of how {{civilian control}} is then to be determined. Huntington identified two shaping forces or imperatives for civilian control – (1) functional and (2) societal. He broke the societal imperative into two components, ideology and structure. By ideology, he meant a world-view or paradigm: liberal anti-military, conservative pro-military, fascist pro-military, and Marxist anti-military. By structure, he meant the legal-constitutional framework that guided political affairs generally and civil-military affairs specifically.|$|E

Lignin <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> limiting factor when using wood to make bio-ethanol because lignin limits the accessibility of cellulose microfibrils to depolymerization by enzymes.|$|E

25|$|The {{foundational}} text {{of most of}} the Old Testament <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> edition done by {{the monks}} of the Benedictine Abbey of St. Jerome under Pope Pius X. The foundational text of the books of Tobit and Judith are from manuscripts of the Vetus Latina rather than the Vulgate. The New Testament was based on the 1969 edition of the Stuttgart Vulgate, and hence on the Oxford Vulgate. All of these base texts were revised to accord with the modern critical editions in Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic. There are also a number of changes where the modern scholars felt that Jerome had failed to grasp the meaning of the original languages, or had rendered it obscurely.|$|E
25|$|A turbine-powered aircraft's takeoff {{procedure}} is designed around ensuring that an engine failure will not endanger the flight. This {{is done by}} planning the takeoff around three critical V speeds, V1, VR and V2. V1 <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> engine failure recognition speed, {{the speed at which}} a takeoff can be continued with an engine failure, and the speed at which stopping distance is no longer guaranteed {{in the event of a}} rejected takeoff. VR is the speed at which the nose is lifted off the runway, a process known as rotation. V2 is the single-engine safety speed, the single engine climb speed. The use of these speeds ensure that either sufficient thrust to continue the takeoff, or sufficient stopping distance to reject it will be available at all times.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} criteria, {{stability}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> consideration {{in evaluating the}} effect of orbital and rotational characteristics on planetary habitability. Orbital eccentricity {{is the difference between}} a planet's farthest and closest approach to its parent star divided by the sum of said distances. It is a ratio describing the shape of the elliptical orbit. The greater the eccentricity the greater the temperature fluctuation on a planet's surface. Although they are adaptive, living organisms can stand only so much variation, particularly if the fluctuations overlap both the freezing point and boiling point of the planet's main biotic solvent (e.g., water on Earth). If, for example, Earth's oceans were alternately boiling and freezing solid, {{it is difficult to imagine}} life as we know it having evolved. The more complex the organism, the greater the temperature sensitivity. The Earth's orbit is almost wholly circular, with an eccentricity of less than 0.02; other planets in the Solar System (with the exception of Mercury) have eccentricities that are similarly benign.|$|E

25|$|A {{turbocharger}} remedies {{this problem}} by compressing the air back to sea-level pressures (turbo-normalizing), or even much higher (turbo-charging), {{in order to produce}} rated power at high altitude. Since the size of the turbocharger is chosen to produce a given amount of pressure at high altitude, the turbocharger is oversized for low altitude. The speed of the turbocharger is controlled by a wastegate. Early systems used a fixed wastegate, resulting in a turbocharger that functioned much like a supercharger. Later systems utilized an adjustable wastegate, controlled either manually by the pilot or by an automatic hydraulic or electric system. When the aircraft is at low altitude the wastegate is usually fully open, venting all the exhaust gases overboard. As the aircraft climbs and the air density drops, the wastegate must continuously close in small increments to maintain full power. The altitude at which the wastegate fully closes and the engine still produces full power <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>critical</b> altitude. When the aircraft climbs above the critical altitude, engine power output decreases as altitude increases, just as it would in a naturally aspirated engine.|$|E
