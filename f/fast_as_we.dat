500|$|On April Fools' Day on , Sunsoft {{announced}} that a sequel to the game would be released on the Virtual Console titled Blaster Master: Destination Fred. According to their press release, the game was only purported to be tested on several PlayChoice-10 machines in the Los Angeles area between 1988 and 1989. Upon discovery of copies {{of the game in}} Sunsoft's headquarters in Japan, Gaijinworks' founder Victor Ireland said: [...] "I was blown away when I saw these. When I was going through boxes of stored code, promotional items, and ROMs to see what we had on hand to release for the U.S. Virtual Console market, finding these nine completely unknown cartridges literally stunned me. I knew it had to be put up on the Virtual Console as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> could make it happen." ...|$|E
500|$|Editing and {{post-production}} work on Alien took roughly 20 {{weeks to}} complete. Terry Rawlings served as editor, having previously worked with Scott on editing sound for The Duellists. Scott and Rawlings edited {{much of the}} film to have a slow pace to build suspense for the more tense and frightening moments. According to Rawlings: [...] "I think {{the way we did}} get it right was by keeping it slow, funny enough, which is completely different from what they do today. And I think the slowness of it made the moments that you wanted people to be sort of scared...then we could go as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> liked because you've sucked people into a corner and then attacked them, so to speak. And I think that's how it worked." [...] The first cut of the film was over three hours long; further editing trimmed the final version to just under two hours.|$|E
500|$|In February 2008, {{plans to}} rebuild the bucentaur {{destroyed}} in 1798 were announced. More than 200 shipbuilders, woodcarvers and jewellers started work on 15 March 2008 at the Arsenale. It has been reported by the Italian press {{that it will take}} two years for the bucentaur to be constructed. However, Colonel Giorgio Paterno, the head of Fondazione Bucintoro which is behind the €20million project, said in March 2008 that [...] "e'll build it as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> can but we're not in a hurry." [...] It is intended that the project will make use of traditional shipbuilding techniques and original materials, including larch and fir wood, and will reproduce gold decorations. The foundation is supported by businessmen in the Veneto and Lombardy regions but has also written to the French President Nicolas Sarkozy for France to make a financial contribution as a goodwill gesture to compensate for Napoleon's [...] "vandalism" [...] of the 1729 vessel.|$|E

30|$|We often {{estimate}} {{the performance of}} a model by calculating its perplexity on a selected development text. Compared to estimation within speech recognition, this method is much <b>faster,</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> only need to estimate each sentence once. Furthermore, {{it has been shown that}} there is a correlation between a language model’s perplexity and its performance in speech recognition [20].|$|R

2500|$|Mayday Parade {{was formed}} {{in the winter of}} 2005 {{following}} the merger of two local Tallahassee bands, Kid Named Chicago and Defining Moment. Kid Named Chicago featured vocalist/guitarist Jason Lancaster, guitarist Alex Garcia and drummer Jake Bundrick, while Defining Moment featured vocalist Derek Sanders, guitarist Brooks Betts, and bassist Jeremy Lenzo. Both bands previously practiced in the same building, before it occurred to Lenzo that it [...] "made more sense if we put them together instead of playing separately." [...] After composing [...] "When I Get Home, You're So Dead" [...] and [...] "Three Cheers for Five Years", the group realised they had [...] "something special". Tales Told by Dead Friends was recorded at Earthsound Recording, in Valdosta, Georgia. Recording was handled by Lee Dyess, who also did mixing. Dan Shike mastered the EP at Tone and Volume Mastering in Nashville, Tennessee. The group recorded the EP [...] "as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> could." ...|$|E

30|$|Deep {{neural network}} {{is simply a}} neural network with {{multiple}} hidden layers. Due to this multiple hidden layers, it can effectively represent any complex input in a hierarchical abstraction. But simply training a deep network with backpropagation to compute the gradient of error will not produce good result. In some cases, the results are even worse than the network with single hidden layers. This lack of progress using deep networks can be mainly attributed to vanishing gradient problem or exploding descent problem. What these mean is that due to the random initialization of weights and backpropagating errors one layer at a time, the weights learn at different speeds. Specifically, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> go backwards from output layer weights learn at decreasing speed. Or sometimes, weights learn very much <b>faster</b> <b>as</b> <b>we</b> go backwards. Either way, the gradient of weights are unstable. This {{is the main reason}} for deep networks to get stuck at learning <b>as</b> <b>we</b> increase the hidden layers.|$|R
