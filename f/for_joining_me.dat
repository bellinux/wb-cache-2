I want him to see the house-maid's face under circumstances which will persuade him that it is your face. And then, going a step further, I want him to see the house-maid leave London, under the impression that he has seen you start on the first stage of your journey to the Brazils. He didn't believe in that journey when I announced it to him this afternoon in the street. He may believe in it yet, if you follow the directions I am now going to give you.|$|E

On June 5, 1981, MMWR {{published}} {{a report of}} Pneumocystis pneumonia in five previously healthy young gay men in Los Angeles, California. This report was later acknowledged as the first {{published a}}ccount of what would become known as human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS. It {{was the first of}} many MMWR reports that led {{to a better understanding of}} this new condition. Today, I'm talking with Dr. Harold Jaffe, a member of the original CDC Task Force assigned to study this mysterious new disease. Dr. Jaffe previously held a number of leadership positions at CDC, including directing the National Center for HIV, Sexually Transmitted Diseases, and Tuberculosis Prevention, and most recently, as CDC 2 ̆ 019 s Associate Director for Science.

I thank Matthew Nice for careful and exhaustive statistical analyses, Russell Martin for painstaking efforts to provide us with data from the CarSharing Portland records and Maren Sounders for prompt and reliable responses to the never-ending stream of questions. I am extremely grateful to Nina DeConcini for continuing support of CarSharing Portland and its first year evaluation. And I owe special thanks to Aphra Katzev for statistical and graphics wizardry. Above all, I wish to acknowledge my deep appreciation to David Brook <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> with <b>me</b> on the project at its inception and for having the gumption to bring a car sharing organization to this community. I know there are many others who are equally grateful for his dedication and desire to see CarSharing Portland succeed...|$|R

"In this missive,--happily for us both, it did {{not contain}} a hundred-pound note or any trifle of that kind,--I {{informed}} you that I was compelled to plan an expedition towards the South Pole; stopping, however, in the Mediterranean; and that I designed leaving this on Monday next for Cadiz or Gibraltar, and then going on to Malta, whence Italy and Sicily would be accessible.

I dedicate this thesis to you both. I would like to thank my thesis advisor, Professor Gene Stanley for taking me into his family of impassioned collaborators, for endless champagne celebrations of life and endless pizza celebrations of science, for teaching by example how to value people, for passionately being his genuine self, for the sense of family that this engendered in his group, for his indefatigable work ethic and boundless curiosity and enthusiasm, for his over-lavish encouragement and thoughtfully over-delicate feedback.

40|$|First and foremost, I {{thank my}} wife, Christine, <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> <b>me</b> in this crazy adventure. I {{am not sure}} she fully {{realized}} what she was getting into when she moved to Georgia, but I am grateful for every day we have shared and will share {{in the years to}} come. I cannot wait to see where life takes us! My family has been a significant influence on my commitment to learning. I believe that seeing both my parents go through college instilled in me a fascination with higher education early on. They have humored my desires to earn a doctorate, despite regularly asking when I would get a job during those first couple years. I know of no better way to thank them than to proudly say I have finally finished. Despite regular jokes about my obsession with being a college student forever, my friends outside of graduate school have been a source of support throughout this, at times seemingly never-ending, journey. With their unwavering faith in my ability to finish my Ph. D. and their regular inquires about whether they could call me “Doctor Dorn ” yet, they have regularly humbled me, distracted me, and kept me in good spirits. I am honored to have such amazing lifelong friends, who are far too numerou...|$|E

First and foremost, I wish to thank my participants. Amina, Alex, Adriana and Ann – I will be forever grateful for your willingness to allow me learn from your teacher preparation; you showed me how strong, wise and loving teachers can be. Your willingness to be vulnerable as we explored uncharted territory together provided me with a needed “window ” into the teacher learning experience. Thank you <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> <b>me</b> on this adventure during a critical time in your teacher licensure program. My heartfelt gratitude also goes to the students, staff, teachers and administration at Chapman Hills Elementary School. I chose to conduct research at Chapman Hills because I had observed exemplary culturally relevant pedagogy from the school’s seasoned teachers. I hadn’t expected to be enveloped into your community as I was, but you warmly welcomed me during a difficult time of transition and for that I am immensely grateful. To all of the scholars and staff whose wisdom and care supported me through my five years at the University of Minnesota, I thank you. To my advisor, Dr. Diane Tedick...|$|E

Treasury Department, the University of Chicago, Johns Hopkins and other places. We are at Dr. Goode’s home at 5420 Connecticut Avenue, N. W., in Washington, D. C. The date today is March 6, 1998, and the time is about 1 : 30 p. m. Dr. Goode, I {{want to thank you very}} much <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> <b>me</b> today, or letting me join you here at your home today. This is an honor for me to meet with you and to have this time to talk. RICHARD B. GOODE: My pleasure. GARDNER: Well, I know that you were born in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1916. Why don’t we begin by talking a little bit about your family background. What did your grandparents and your parents do in the Fort Worth area? 2 GOODE: Well, one of my grandfathers was a Baptist preacher. The other grandfather was an active Baptist layman. It so happens that my birthday and their birthdays were all on July thirty-first; an unusual coincidence. So I’m named after both of them: Richard and Benjamin. I don’t use the middle name much, but that’s my middle name. When I was born, my father was a small farmer. He had a varied career. Later, he was a carpenter and small contractor, and we always lived around in that area. My father was born in East Texas; my mother was born in Georgia. And that’s the family history. I was the only one of my immediate family—I had two older sisters—to attend college. Neither my parents nor my older sisters did. GARDNER: Your grandfather who was a preacher, was he a pastor of a church? GOODE: I think he was at various times, but not when I remember him. He was—well, he was essentially retired when I remembered him. My great-grandfather, by the way, was born in the eighteenth century. GARDNER: Is that right? GOODE: In 1786. GARDNER: Was that also in Texas...|$|E
40|$|Message {{from the}} President Thank you <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> <b>me</b> in this {{look back over}} the past year at the University of New Mexico. It was a year filled with activity, {{accomplishment}} and challenge, and this is our opportunity to reflect back on that year. In 2000 - 2001 we engaged in a University-wide strategic planning process that called on the energies and talents of hundreds of individuals- faculty, staff, students and members of our broader community. The plan, which will be completed in Fall 2001, will serve as our roadmap for the future and will guide our efforts to capitalize on the opportunities and {{to meet the challenges of}} the next several years. This process has encouraged us to examine closely our mission and our values, who we are and what we aspire to become. It has given us reason to be proud of our past and cause to think seriously about how we must change in the future. While this was a year for looking ahead, it was also a year of significant accomplishment. For example, we launched a comprehensive set of programs designed to enrich the academic and social experiences of our undergraduate students. We began the implementation of Freshman Learning Communities where small cohorts of students study and learn together in a common set of courses under the guidance of a senior faculty scholar. We reorganized our advisement systems, we undertook the construction or renovation of student-centered facilities on campus, and we created new support systems to enhance student academic success. It was a year in which our support of faculty, staff and students was our highest priority. Through the support of the New Mexico Legislature, faculty and staff received significant salary increases. A new health benefits plan for graduate assistants was implemented. Our "Staff as Students" program enabled more than 40 staff members to obtain UNM degrees. And, a Center for Scholarship in Teaching and Learning was established to assist faculty in their efforts to develop more effective teaching skills. Finally, this was a year in which UNM dramatically expanded its role in the local community and throughout the state. Never before has the University been as active or as visible in meeting its public responsibility as it was in 2000 - 2001. From its active participation in economic development initiatives, to its involvement in K- 12 educational improvement efforts, to its significant leadership role in health care delivery, UNM demonstrated its ability to help the state meet its most pressing social challenges. And, as UNM took on a more visible role in supporting the state's citizens, the support for UNM was returned in kind. This year, annual giving to the University rose to a record 35. 3 million dollars, a 40 % increase over just two years ago. All told, it has been a gratifying and successful year. However, we cannot allow our past accomplishments to mask the continued challenges facing this University. Neither will we allow these challenges to dominate our thinking and diminish out pride in what the University has achieved. So we will savor our successes and continue to move forward. As always, we thank you for sharing our dreams and for supporting the University of New Mexico. Sincerely, William C. Gordon, PresidentUniversity of New Mexic...|$|E
