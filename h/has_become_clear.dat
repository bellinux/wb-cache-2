5|$|Originally Aristotle divided {{all living}} things between plants, which {{generally}} do not move fast enough for humans to notice, and animals. In Linnaeus' system, these became the kingdoms Vegetabilia (later Plantae) and Animalia. Since then, it <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>clear</b> that the Plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the fungi and several groups of algae were removed to new kingdoms. However, these are still often considered plants in many contexts. Bacterial life is sometimes included in flora, and some classifications use the term bacterial flora separately from plant flora.|$|E

Trophic cascades were originally {{thought to be}} rare, but it <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>clear</b> that they occur across diverse terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems at both small and large spatial and temporal scales.

25|$|The {{history of}} jazz in Cuba was hidden {{for many years}} by the unwillingness of record {{companies}} to make recordings available. However, in recent years, it <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>clear</b> that its history in Cuba is as long as its history in the USA. The key figure in revealing {{the early days of}} Cuban jazz is Leonardo Acosta, musician and musicologist, who has been working on this topic for many years. Others have explored the history of jazz and Latin jazz from the U.S. perspective. The pre-history of Cuban jazz includes musicians like Louis Moreau Gottschalk and W.C. Handy, who visited Cuba and brought creole ideas into their music.|$|E
25|$|Bin Laden's {{location}} and {{state of health}} were a continuing topic of speculation since his disappearance from Tora Bora. It <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>clear</b> {{that most of these}} rumors and speculation were not based on fact. First, rumors surfaced that bin Laden was killed or fatally injured during U.S. bombardments, most notably near Tora Bora, or that he died of natural causes. According to Gary Berntsen, in his 2005 book, , a number of al-Qaeda detainees later confirmed that bin Laden had escaped Tora Bora into Pakistan via an eastern route through snow-covered mountains in the area of Parachinar, Pakistan. The media reported that bin Laden suffered from a kidney disorder requiring him to have access to advanced medical facilities, possibly kidney dialysis. Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Qaeda's second-in-command and a close bin Laden associate, is a physician and may have provided medical care to bin Laden.|$|E
25|$|More recently, it <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>clear</b> {{that the}} Anseriformes (waterfowl) and the Galliformes {{are the most}} ancient groups of modern birds. It is possible, though not at all well-supported, that these were {{distinct}} {{by the end of}} the Albian 100 million years ago (Ma). Loons belong to a more modern radiation. They were once believed to be related to grebes, which are also foot-propelled diving birds, and both species were once classified together under the order Colymbiformes. However, as recently as the 1930s, it was determined that the two groups are not that closely related at all and are merely the product of convergent evolution and adapted in a similar way to a similar ecological niche. The similarity is so strong that even the most modern cladistic analyses of general anatomical features are easily misled into grouping loons and grebes.|$|E

25|$|However, {{with recent}} {{advances}} in ecological understanding it <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>clear</b> that draining of this vast lake affected the entire climate of this important region that is India's capital territory and its neighbourhood. The draining of the lake completely also caused the watertable in the entire area {{to go down and}} the area becoming arid. There have been some plans since to at least resurrect a much smaller lake in the area. Most of the Najafgarh jheel basin lands have increased many folds in their value owing to them coming within Delhi, India's capital territory and are under ownership of farmers who may want to make a fast buck selling them to developers who want to convert the former lake basin into housing complexes as has already been happening with major housing colonies coming up in the region. If Najafgarh drain, which was built to drain the original Najafgarh lake or jheel, ever breaches its wide embankments it will flood these developed lands owing to them spread all over the former low lying jheel or lake basin.|$|E
25|$|The tale told in Sverre's saga is the {{official}} version. Historians have questioned the veracity of it, {{especially with regard to}} Sverre's alleged paternity. Some historians have considered his claim to be King Sigurd's son to be false, as did many of his contemporaries. Others have believed the paternal claim to be true, while most historians have found that the paternal question can not be given a definite answer. Although the fact that kings fathered illegitimate sons was taken for granted, other facts indicate that Sverre was in his early thirties when he came to Norway, such as the age of his own sons and nephews. It has been cited against Sverre's claim that according to Canon law, one had to be at least 30 years old to be eligible for the priesthood. If Sverre was 30 years old when he became a priest, this would place his birth no later than 1145, making his paternal claim impossible, as Sigurd Munn was born in 1133. This particular objection has lost credence as it <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>clear</b> that this age limit was routinely ignored in Scandinavia at the time. However, other objections remain, such as the fact that Sverre consistently refused to undergo an ordeal by fire to prove his claims. At the time, such a trial was routine for new claimants to the throne, and belief in its efficacy seems to have been universal; yet Sverre refused to undergo it. If Sverre's claim was false, however, he would lack royal legitimacy, dooming his plans to failure. Regardless, his motivation is clear: to capture the throne of Norway, whether he could prove royal blood or not. After all, Norway had seen other claimants, since Harald Gille, whose paternity was equally questionable.|$|E

500|$|The writer {{adds that}} Walton's {{allegiance}} to his basic style never wavered {{and that this}} loyalty to his own vision, together with his rhythmic vitality, sensuous melancholy, sly charm and orchestral flair, gives Walton's finest music [...] "an imperishable glamour".

500|$|However, as {{algorithmic}} {{improvements and}} computer performance have erased purely technical deficiencies in older approaches, it <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>clear</b> {{that there is}} no one universal criterion for the 'optimal' structural alignment. TM-align, for instance, is particularly robust in quantifying comparisons between sets of proteins with great disparities in sequence lengths, but it only indirectly captures hydrogen bonding or secondary structure order conservation which might be better [...] metrics for alignment of evolutionarily related proteins. Thus recent developments have focused on optimizing particular attributes such as speed, quantification of scores, correlation to alternative gold standards, or tolerance of imperfection in structural data or ab initio structural models. An alternative methodology that is gaining popularity is to use the consensus of various methods to ascertain proteins structural similarities.|$|E
500|$|Early traditions {{supporting}} a literal interpretation are transmitted on {{the authority of}} companions of Muhammad such as Ibn Abbas, Anas bin Malik, Abdullah bin Masud and others.

The Qur'anic verses [...] {{was part of the}} debate between medieval Muslim theologians and Muslim philosophers over the issue of the inviolability of heavenly bodies.

500|$|Al-Zamakhshari, {{a famous}} {{commentator}} of the Qur'an, acknowledged the splitting {{of the moon}} as one of Muhammad's miracles. But he also suggested that the splitting might take place only {{on the day of}} judgment. The Muslim scholar Yusuf Ali provides three different interpretations of the verse. He holds that perhaps all three are applicable to the verse: Moon once appeared cleft asunder at the time of Muhammad in order to convince the unbelievers. It will split again when the day of judgment approaches (here the prophetic past tense is taken to indicate the future). Yusuf Ali connects this incident with the disruption of the solar system mentioned in [...] Lastly, he says that the verses can be metaphorical, meaning that the matter <b>has</b> <b>become</b> <b>clear</b> as the moon.|$|E

Greer noted that [...] "most of the doctor affidavits submitted are based on their understanding of Schiavo's condition from news reports or video clips they have seen.
