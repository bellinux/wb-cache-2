5|$|In New York, Michael {{manages to}} talk to Wallace, who has {{seemingly}} been avoiding him, and complains that it is unfair {{that he has to}} drive to New York in order {{to talk to}} him <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> phone, and that he deserves more respect after being at Dunder Mifflin for fifteen years. David agrees to fund an anniversary party for him and attend, but Michael abruptly announces his resignation from the company and walks out.|$|E
5|$|On 9 January 2017, {{a new set}} {{of opening}} titles debuted. The titles now feature the cast members posing in front of green screen, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sets. Viewers also noticed that actors Ryan Moloney, Colette Mann and Zoe Cramond had their names misspelled. The {{spelling}} errors were corrected by the production team and the edited titles debuted the following day. The opening title sequence was updated in April 2017, following the arrival of the new Rebecchi family. The style of the titles was not changed, but most of the cast shots were re-filmed.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{featured}} preliminary matches was Shawn Michaels versus Ric Flair in a singles match. The hype to this match began on May 26, 2003 during {{an episode of}} Raw, where Michaels challenged Flair to a singles match for later during the show, which Flair accepted. As the match {{was about to take}} place, the other General Manager, Eric Bischoff, announced that the Flair versus Michaels match was to take place at Bad Blood <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> broadcast of Raw. Later on that episode, Flair and Michaels lost to World Champion Triple H in a Handicap match after Flair cheap shoted Michaels, enabling Triple H to finish him off with the Pedigree. The following Monday on an episode of Raw, Michaels and Flair were in a promotional in-ring segment, where they both discussed who was the better wrestler. Later during the program, Michaels, along with Kevin Nash and The Hurricane defeated Evolution. The feud between Flair and Michaels enhanced on the June 9, 2003 episode of Raw. During the show, Flair and Michaels managed Randy Orton and The Hurricane, respectively; after Orton defeated The Hurricane, Flair and Michaels were scripted to brawl until the program went into a commercial break.|$|E

Severe near-sightedness {{increases the risk of}} retinal detachment, cataracts, and glaucoma.|$|E

Compared to cooking over a fire, the food does not have a smoky flavor.|$|E

25|$|This {{group of}} volcanoes is {{unlike many other}} {{volcanic}} groups in Canada as it resides on islands <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mainland.

The main objective of the naval service was to disrupt the supply lines from Egypt to Palestine, completing the Egyptian expeditionary force's encirclement, and force Egypt to allocate large forces to fight against targets at sea <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, where Operation Yoav was conducted.|$|E
25|$|The bill amends the Uniform Time Act of 1966 by {{changing}} the start and end dates of daylight saving time, beginning in 2007.

25|$|Sidemount is a {{scuba diving}} {{equipment}} configuration which has scuba sets mounted alongside the diver, below {{the shoulders and}} along the hips, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> back of the diver. It originated as a configuration for advanced cave diving, as it facilitates penetration of tight sections of cave, allows easy access to cylinder valves, provides easy and reliable gas redundancy, and tanks can be easily removed when necessary. These benefits for operating in confined spaces were also recognized by divers who conducted technical wreck diving penetrations.|$|E
25|$|On October 29, 2007, newly {{refurbished}} EN57 units modernized by ZNTK Mińsk Mazowiecki entered service. The refurbishments {{included an}} improved shape for aerodynamics. New security systems, {{one of which}} prevents the doors from opening while the train is in motion, were also added. Additionally, dividing walls between cars were removed and seats were mounted on walls <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> floor. The trains were made more accessible by improving access to toilets and adding electronic displays and station announcements. Crew compartments were equipped with an air conditioning system. The total cost of modernization came to 18,000,000zł, 5,000,000 of which was covered by the European Union.|$|E
25|$|Temnodontosaurus {{species are}} {{sometimes}} mistaken for dolphin relatives {{due to their}} similar overall morphology. However, the morphological traits are convergent. Temnodontosaurus were not mammals but were large marine reptiles and their ancestors were land dwelling reptiles. Temnodontosaurus do have morphological traits which differ from Cetacea also. Temnodontosaurus tail would beat laterally side to side, instead of up and down. Temnodontosaurus skull's also have nostrils that are {{placed in front of}} the eyes <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dorsal side of the head like Cetaceans. Though reptiles, Temnodontosaurus can also be mistaken for fish due to their fins and elongate undifferentiated body, but unlike fish Temnodontosaurus are air breathers and must go to the water’s surface for air. Also Temnodontosaurus, like other Ichthyosaurs, are viviparous.|$|E

500|$|The bayside hills between Rosecrans Street and Chatsworth Boulevard {{north of}} Nimitz Boulevard {{are known as}} Loma Portal. A {{distinctive}} feature of this neighborhood is the location of street lights {{in the middle of}} several street intersections <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sidewalk. Loma Portal lies directly in the takeoff pattern for planes from Lindbergh Field, making it the home of the [...] "Point Loma Pause" [...] where all conversation ceases temporarily due to airplane noise. The east-west streets in Roseville and Loma Portal are known as the [...] "alphabetical author streets". The streets are named for authors in alphabetical order from Addison to Zola, with a second partial cycle from Alcott to Lytton.|$|E
500|$|Little {{is known}} {{on the actual}} {{production}} of the film, but the The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer provided {{some insight into the}} production. The review and the synopsis are at odds on several aspects including on whether or not the man was fired for drunkenness or for no reason. In this case, it can be assumed that a drunken state was either not depicted or done inadequately. The reviewer states the [...] "impossible parts of the plot are gracefully omitted" [...] in reference to the abduction of the little girl played by Marie Eline and the overpowering of the chauffeur. Here the synopsis also differs, saying the girl is enticed away instead of being kidnapped. Though the overpowering of the chauffeur is required and acknowledged in the synopsis, the reviewer makes clear the actual method is not depicted. The reviewer also had a keen eye for detail, stating that the passengers disembarked {{into the middle of the}} street <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sidewalk. The final scene's setting is captured in a surviving film still that shows the little girl persuading her parents to hire Jim in the police station with three officers looking on in the background.|$|E
500|$|Several NBA {{players and}} coaches said the brawl was the worst fight they had ever seen. Pacers fans began {{to refer to the}} team as [...] "the Thugs". Pistons CEO Tom Wilson later stated that Artest's action took away {{physical}} barriers, such as tables and benches, that normally separate fans and players, and Indianapolis Star reporter Mark Montieth claimed [...] that [...] "in a way, [...] provoked [...] passively by lying down". In the post-game commentary on ESPN's NBA Shootaround, ESPN's studio analysts laid the blame on the Pistons' fans <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> players. John Saunders of ESPN referred to the fans as [...] "a bunch of punks". [...] Tim Legler said that [...] "the fans crossed the line". Stephen A. Smith stated that [...] "They should be ashamed of themselves and some of them (the fans) should be arrested as far as I'm concerned". Their commentary prompted ESPN vice president Mark Shapiro to place calls to host Saunders, as well as analysts Legler, Smith, and Greg Anthony. Shapiro felt their commentary was biased. The following Tuesday, Shapiro stated, [...] "I wish the studio hadn't laid the blame solely {{on the backs of the}} fans Friday night." ...|$|E
50|$|Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) is a routing {{protocol}} for wireless mesh networks. It {{is similar to}} AODV in that it forms a route on-demand when a transmitting node requests one.
