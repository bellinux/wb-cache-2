In this experimental study total ten beams were casted, one beam without opening (i. e. solid beam) and one beam with rectangular post opening and these two considered as a control beams for comparison. The remaining eight beams were externally strengthened by Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) and Glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) sheets with different strengthening techniques i. e. around the <b>opening,</b> <b>inside</b> the <b>opening,</b> <b>inside</b> and around the opening and double layer around the opening.

50|$|The second die type, {{known as}} a {{pressure}} type die, relies on contact between the jacketing polymer and bare wire inside the die. In this die type, a ring of polymer melt under pressure is forced around the bare wire. Due to the applied pressure of the melt, the opening around the inlet for the bare wire must be very small, {{on the order of}} 0.05 mm. The size of the exit <b>opening</b> <b>controls</b> the thickness of the resulting coating. This type of die results in more intimate contact between the outer coating and the bare wire than the jacketing die.|$|R

40|$|AbstractGreat {{progress}} {{in studies of}} protein dynamics {{in the past decade}} propels an essential alteration in our understanding of the enzymatic catalysis phenomenon. A careful analysis of assumptions made by the hitherto used conventional theory of chemical reactions shows that neither of them is in fact satisfied. One of the reasons is the presence of a slow interconformational dynamics within the protein native state. In consequence, the simple classical statement “enzymes accelerate reactions by decreasing the free energy of activation” represents only half of the truth. Enzymatic reactions actually proceed through ‘gates’ of relatively low free energy {{but it is not the}} process of activated gate crossing that limits the reaction rate, but the process of generally non-activated gate <b>opening,</b> <b>controlled</b> by the conformational relaxation. Possible consequences of this fact are pointed out...|$|R
