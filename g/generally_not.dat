5|$|Exsudoporus frostii {{mushrooms}} can {{be recognized}} by their dark red sticky caps, the red pores, the network-like pattern of the stipe, and the bluing reaction to tissue injury.

Although the mushrooms are considered edible, they are <b>generally</b> <b>not</b> recommended for consumption {{because of the risk}} of confusion with other poisonous red-pored, blue-bruising boletes. E.frostii may be distinguished from other superficially similar red-capped boletes by differences in distribution, associated tree species, bluing reaction, or morphology.|$|E
