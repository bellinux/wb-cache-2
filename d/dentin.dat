5|$|Many topical {{treatments}} for <b>dentin</b> hypersensitivity are available, including desensitizing toothpastes and protective varnishes that coat the exposed <b>dentin</b> surface. Treatment {{of the root}} cause is critical, as topical measures are typically short lasting. Over time, the pulp usually adapts by producing new layers of <b>dentin</b> inside the pulp chamber called tertiary <b>dentin,</b> increasing the thickness between the pulp and the exposed <b>dentin</b> surface and lessening the hypersensitivity.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dentin</b> {{dysplasia}} is {{a disorder}} {{in which the}} roots and pulp of teeth may be affected.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dentin</b> is a mineralized {{connective}} tissue with an organic matrix of collagenous proteins. <b>Dentin</b> has microscopic channels, called dentinal tubules, which radiate outward through the <b>dentin</b> from the pulp cavity to the exterior cementum or enamel border. The diameter of these tubules range from 2.5 μm near the pulp, to 1.2 μm in the midportion, and 900nm near the dentino-enamel junction. Although {{they may have}} tiny side-branches, the tubules do not intersect with each other. Their length is dictated by the radius of the tooth. The three dimensional configuration of the dentinal tubules is genetically determined.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dentin</b> is the {{substance}} between enamel or cementum and the pulp chamber. It is secreted by the odontoblasts of the dental pulp. The formation of <b>dentin</b> {{is known as}} dentinogenesis. The porous, yellow-hued material {{is made up of}} 70% inorganic materials, 20% organic materials, and 10% water by weight. Because it is softer than enamel, it decays more rapidly and is subject to severe cavities if not properly treated, but <b>dentin</b> still acts as a protective layer and supports the crown of the tooth.|$|E
5|$|Dentinogenesis imperfecta is a {{condition}} in which <b>dentin</b> does not form properly and is sometimes associated with osteogenesis imperfecta.|$|E
5|$|Enamel is {{the hardest}} and most highly mineralized {{substance}} of the body. It {{is one of the}} four major tissues which make up the tooth, along with <b>dentin,</b> cementum, and dental pulp. It is normally visible and must be supported by underlying <b>dentin.</b> 96% of enamel consists of mineral, with water and organic material comprising the rest. The normal color of enamel varies from light yellow to grayish white. At the edges of teeth where there is no <b>dentin</b> underlying the enamel, the color sometimes has a slightly blue tone. Since enamel is semitranslucent, the color of <b>dentin</b> and any restorative dental material underneath the enamel strongly affects the appearance of a tooth. Enamel varies in thickness over the surface of the tooth and is often thickest at the cusp, up to 2.5mm, and thinnest at its border, which is seen clinically as the CEJ. The wear rate of enamel, called attrition, is 8 micrometers a year from normal factors.|$|E
5|$|Reversible pulpitis is {{characterized}} by short-lasting pain triggered by cold and sometimes heat. The symptoms of reversible pulpitis may disappear, either because the noxious stimulus is removed, such as when dental decay is removed and a filling placed, or because new layers of <b>dentin</b> (tertiary <b>dentin)</b> have been produced inside the pulp chamber, insulating against the stimulus. Irreversible pulpitis causes spontaneous or lingering pain in response to cold.|$|E
5|$|Enamel's {{primary mineral}} is hydroxyapatite, {{which is a}} {{crystalline}} calcium phosphate. The large amount of minerals in enamel accounts {{not only for its}} strength but also for its brittleness. <b>Dentin,</b> which is less mineralized and less brittle, compensates for enamel and is necessary as a support. Unlike <b>dentin</b> and bone, enamel does not contain collagen. Proteins of note in the development of enamel are ameloblastins, amelogenins, enamelins and tuftelins. It is believed that they aid in the development of enamel by serving as framework support, among other functions.|$|E
5|$|Prismatic enamel - The enamel coating on {{the surface}} of a tooth {{consists}} of prisms, solid, rod-like structures extending from the <b>dentin</b> to the tooth's surface.|$|E
5|$|A tooth is {{composed}} of an outer shell of calcified hard tissues (from hardest to softest: enamel, <b>dentin,</b> and cementum), and an inner soft tissue core (the pulp system), which contains nerves and blood vessels. The visible parts of the teeth in the mouth — the crowns (covered by enamel) — are anchored into the bone by the roots (covered by cementum). Underneath the cementum and enamel layers, <b>dentin</b> forms {{the bulk of the}} tooth and surrounds the pulp system. The part of the pulp inside the crown is the pulp chamber, and the central soft tissue nutrient canals within each root are root canals, exiting through one or more holes at the root end (apical foramen/foramina). The periodontal ligament connects the roots to the bony socket. The gingiva covers the alveolar processes, the tooth-bearing arches of the jaws.|$|E
5|$|Cracked tooth {{syndrome}} {{refers to}} a highly variable set of pain-sensitivity symptoms that may accompany a tooth fracture, usually sporadic, sharp pain that occurs during biting or with release of biting pressure, or relieved by releasing pressure on the tooth. The term is falling into disfavor and {{has given way to}} the more generalized description of fractures and cracks of the tooth, which allows for the wide variations in signs, symptoms, and prognosis for traumatized teeth. A fracture of a tooth can involve the enamel, <b>dentin,</b> and/or pulp, and can be orientated horizontally or vertically. Fractured or cracked teeth can cause pain via several mechanisms, including <b>dentin</b> hypersensitivity, pulpitis (reversible or irreversible), or periodontal pain. Accordingly, there is no single test or combination of symptoms that accurately diagnose a fracture or crack, although when pain can be stimulated by causing separation of the cusps of the tooth, it's highly suggestive of the disorder. Vertical fractures can be very difficult to identify because the crack can rarely be probed or seen on radiographs, as the fracture runs in the plane of conventional films (similar to how the split between two adjacent panes of glass is invisible when facing them).|$|E
5|$|Occlusal trauma {{results from}} {{excessive}} biting forces exerted on teeth, which overloads the periodontal ligament, causing periodontal pain and a reversible increase in tooth mobility. Occlusal trauma may occur with bruxism, the parafunctional (abnormal) clenching and grinding of teeth during sleep or while awake. Over time, {{there may be}} attrition (tooth wear), which may also cause <b>dentin</b> hypersensitivity, and possibly formation of a periodontal abscess, as the occlusal trauma causes adaptive changes in the alveolar bone.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{eruption}} may {{be altered}} by some environmental factors. When eruption is prematurely stopped, the tooth {{is said to}} be impacted. The most common cause of tooth impaction is lack of space in the mouth for the tooth. Other causes may be tumors, cysts, trauma, and thickened bone or soft tissue. Tooth ankylosis occurs when the tooth has already erupted into the mouth but the cementum or <b>dentin</b> has fused with the alveolar bone. This may cause a person to retain their primary tooth instead of having it replaced by a permanent one.|$|E
5|$|Cementum is a {{specialized}} bone like substance covering {{the root of}} a tooth. It is approximately 45% inorganic material (mainly hydroxyapatite), 33% organic material (mainly collagen) and 22% water. Cementum is excreted by cementoblasts within {{the root of the}} tooth and is thickest at the root apex. Its coloration is yellowish and it is softer than <b>dentin</b> and enamel. The principal role of cementum is to serve as a medium by which the periodontal ligaments can attach to the tooth for stability. At the cementoenamel junction, the cementum is acellular due to its lack of cellular components, and this acellular type covers at least ⅔ of the root. The more permeable form of cementum, cellular cementum, covers about ⅓ of the root apex.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{development}} is the complex process by which teeth form from embryonic cells, grow, and erupt into the mouth. Although many diverse species have teeth, their {{development is}} largely {{the same as in}} humans. For human teeth to have a healthy oral environment, enamel, <b>dentin,</b> cementum, and the periodontium must all develop during appropriate stages of fetal development. Primary teeth start to form {{in the development of the}} embryo between the sixth and eighth weeks, and permanent teeth begin to form in the twentieth week. If teeth do not start to develop at or near these times, they will not develop at all.|$|E
5|$|Several suborders of stegocephalians were {{recognized}} in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Animals now regarded as temnospondyls were primarily labyrinthodonts, but some were classified in the Branchiosauria. Branchiosaurs were small-bodied and had simple conical teeth, while labyrinthodonts were larger and had complex, folded <b>dentin</b> and enamel in their teeth. Branchiosauria included only a few forms, such as Branchiosaurus from Europe and Amphibamus from North America, that had poorly developed bones, external gills, and no ribs. Some skeletons of Amphibamus were later found with long ribs, prompting its reassignment to Microsauria (although more detailed studies {{found it to be}} a temnospondyl). Soft tissue, such as scales and external gills, were found in many well-preserved branchiosaur fossils from Germany. In the early 20th century, branchiosaurs would be recognized as larval forms of temnospondyls lacking many of the typical features that define the group, and is no longer recognized as a distinct group.|$|E
5|$|The chief complaint, and {{the onset}} of the complaint, are usually {{important}} in the diagnosis of toothache. For example, the key distinction between reversible and irreversible pulpitis is given in the history, such as pain following a stimulus in the former, and lingering pain following a stimulus and spontaneous pain in the latter. History is also important in recent filling or other dental treatment, and trauma to the teeth. Based on the most common causes of toothache (<b>dentin</b> hypersensitivity, periodontitis, and pulpitis), the key indicators become localization of the pain (whether the pain is perceived as originating in a specific tooth), thermal sensitivity, pain on biting, spontaneity of the pain, and factors that make the pain worse.The various qualities of the toothache, such as the effect of biting and chewing on the pain, the effect of thermal stimuli, and the effect of the pain on sleep, are verbally established by the clinician, usually in a systematic fashion, such as using the Socrates pain assessment method (see table).|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{destruction}} from processes {{other than}} dental caries {{is considered a}} normal physiologic process but may become severe enough to become a pathologic condition. Attrition {{is the loss of}} tooth structure by mechanical forces from opposing teeth. Attrition initially affects the enamel and, if unchecked, may proceed to the underlying <b>dentin.</b> Abrasion is the loss of tooth structure by mechanical forces from a foreign element. If this force begins at the cementoenamel junction, then progression of tooth loss can be rapid since enamel is very thin in this region of the tooth. A common source of this type of tooth wear is excessive force when using a toothbrush. Erosion is the loss of tooth structure due to chemical dissolution by acids not of bacterial origin. Signs of tooth destruction from erosion is a common characteristic in the mouths of people with bulimia since vomiting results in exposure of the teeth to gastric acids. Another important source of erosive acids are from frequent sucking of lemon juice. Abfraction is the loss of tooth structure from flexural forces. As teeth flex under pressure, the arrangement of teeth touching each other, known as occlusion, causes tension {{on one side of the}} tooth and compression on the other side of the tooth. This is believed to cause V-shaped depressions on the side under tension and C-shaped depressions on the side under compression. When tooth destruction occurs at the roots of teeth, the process is referred to as internal resorption, when caused by cells within the pulp, or external resorption, when caused by cells in the periodontal ligament.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dentin</b> formation, {{known as}} dentinogenesis, {{is the first}} {{identifiable}} feature in the crown stage of tooth development. The formation of <b>dentin</b> must always occur before the formation of enamel. The different stages of <b>dentin</b> formation result in different types of dentin: mantle <b>dentin,</b> primary <b>dentin,</b> secondary <b>dentin,</b> and tertiary <b>dentin.</b>|$|E
25|$|After <b>dentin</b> {{formation}} begins, {{the cells}} of the IEE secrete an organic matrix against the <b>dentin.</b> This matrix immediately mineralizes and becomes the initial layer of the tooth's enamel. Outside the <b>dentin</b> are the newly formed ameloblasts in response to the formation of <b>dentin,</b> which are cells that continue the process of enamel formation; therefore, enamel formation moves outwards, adding new material to the outer surface of the developing tooth.|$|E
25|$|Secondary <b>dentin</b> {{is formed}} after root {{formation}} is finished and occurs {{at a much}} slower rate. It is not formed at a uniform rate along the tooth, but instead forms faster along sections closer to the crown of a tooth. This development continues throughout life and accounts for the smaller areas of pulp found in older individuals. Tertiary <b>dentin,</b> also known as reparative <b>dentin,</b> forms in reaction to stimuli, such as attrition or dental caries.|$|E
25|$|Whereas mantle <b>dentin</b> forms {{from the}} preexisting ground {{substance}} of the dental papilla, primary <b>dentin</b> forms through a different process. Odontoblasts increase in size, eliminating the availability of any extracellular resources to contribute to an organic matrix for mineralization. Additionally, the larger odontoblasts cause collagen to be secreted in smaller amounts, which results in more tightly arranged, heterogeneous nucleation that is used for mineralization. Other materials (such as lipids, phosphoproteins, and phospholipids) are also secreted.|$|E
25|$|The normal {{color of}} enamel varies from light yellow to grayish (bluish) white. At {{the edges of}} teeth {{where there is no}} <b>dentin</b> {{underlying}} the enamel, the color sometimes has a slightly blue or translucent off-white tone, easily observable on the upper incisors. Since enamel is semitranslucent, the color of <b>dentin</b> and any material underneath the enamel strongly affects the appearance of a tooth. The enamel on primary teeth has a more opaque crystalline form and thus appears whiter than on permanent teeth.|$|E
25|$|The {{large amount}} of mineral in enamel {{accounts}} {{not only for its}} strength but also for its brittleness. Tooth enamel ranks 5 on Mohs hardness scale and has a Young's modulus of 83 GPa. <b>Dentin,</b> less mineralized and less brittle, 3–4 in hardness, compensates for enamel and is necessary as a support. On radiographs, the differences in the mineralization of different portions of the tooth and surrounding periodontium can be noted; enamel appears lighter than <b>dentin</b> or pulp since it is denser than both and more radiopaque.|$|E
25|$|Hypersensitive teeth, (e.g. dental pain when {{drinking}} a cold liquid) caused by wearing away of {{the thickness of}} insulating layers of <b>dentin</b> and enamel around the dental pulp.|$|E
25|$|Odontoblasts, the dentin-forming cells, {{differentiate}} from {{cells of the}} dental papilla. They begin secreting an organic matrix around the area directly adjacent to the inner enamel epithelium, closest {{to the area of}} the future cusp of a tooth. The organic matrix contains collagen fibers with large diameters (0.1–0.2μm in diameter). The odontoblasts begin to move {{toward the center of the}} tooth, forming an extension called the odontoblast process. Thus, <b>dentin</b> formation proceeds toward the inside of the tooth. The odontoblast process causes the secretion of hydroxyapatite crystals and mineralization of the matrix. This area of mineralization is known as mantle <b>dentin</b> and is a layer usually about 150μm thick.|$|E
25|$|Teeth can {{be damaged}} by several factors {{including}} poor oral hygiene, {{but also by}} wrong oral hygiene. Especially for sensitive teeth, damage to <b>dentin</b> and gums can be prevented by several measures including a correct brushing technique.|$|E
25|$|The mineral {{distribution}} in rodent enamel {{is different from}} that of monkeys, dogs, pigs, and humans. In horse teeth, the enamel and <b>dentin</b> layers are intertwined with each other, which increases the strength and wear resistance of those teeth.|$|E
25|$|Most dental restorations {{involve the}} removal of enamel. Frequently, the purpose of removal is {{to gain access to}} the {{underlying}} decay in the <b>dentin</b> or inflammation in the pulp. This is typically the case in amalgam restorations and endodontic treatment.|$|E
25|$|Aesthetics {{is another}} reason for the removal of enamel. Removing enamel is {{necessary}} when placing crowns and veneers to enhance the appearance of teeth. In both of these instances, when unsupported by underlying <b>dentin,</b> that portion of the enamel is more vulnerable to fracture.|$|E
25|$|Nerve fibers {{start to}} near the tooth during the cap stage of tooth {{development}} and grow toward the dental follicle. Once there, the nerves develop around the tooth bud {{and enter the}} dental papilla when <b>dentin</b> formation has begun. Nerves never proliferate into the enamel organ.|$|E
25|$|Once a lesion has cavitated, {{especially}} if <b>dentin</b> is involved, remineralization {{is much more}} difficult and a dental restoration is usually indicated ("operative treatment"). Before a restoration can be placed, all of the decay must be removed otherwise it will continue to progress underneath the filling. Sometimes a small amount of decay can be left if it is entombed and there is a seal which isolates the bacteria from their substrate. This can be likened to placing a glass container over a candle, which burns itself out once the oxygen is used up. Techniques such as stepwise caries removal are designed to avoid exposure of the dental pulp and overall reduction of the amount of tooth substance which requires removal before the final filling is placed. Often enamel which overlies decayed <b>dentin</b> must also be removed as it is unsupported and susceptible to fracture. The modern decision-making process with regards the activity of the lesion, and whether it is cavitated, is summarized in the table.|$|E
25|$|The teeth have enamel on {{the outside}} and exposed <b>dentin</b> on the inside, so they self-sharpen during gnawing. On the other hand, {{continually}} growing molars are found in some rodent species, such as the sibling vole and the guinea pig. There is variation in the dentition of the rodents, but generally, rodents lack canines and premolars, and have a space between their incisors and molars, called the diastema region.|$|E
25|$|The {{incidence}} of cemental caries increases in older adults as gingival recession occurs from either trauma or periodontal disease. It is a chronic condition that forms a large, shallow lesion and slowly invades first the root’s cementum and then <b>dentin</b> {{to cause a}} chronic infection of the pulp (see further discussion under classification by affected hard tissue). Because dental pain is a late finding, many lesions are not detected early, resulting in restorative challenges and increased tooth loss.|$|E
25|$|Tooth enamel {{is one of}} {{the four}} major tissues that make up the tooth in humans and many other animals, {{including}} some species of fish. It makes up the normally visible part of the tooth, covering the crown. The other major tissues are <b>dentin,</b> cementum, and dental pulp. It is a very hard, white to off-white, highly mineralised substance that acts as a barrier to protect the tooth but can become susceptible to degradation, especially by acids from food and drink.|$|E
25|$|The {{characteristics}} of the lower jaw are therefore {{the lack of a}} chin {{on the one hand and}} on the other it is the considerable size of the lower jaw bone, on which, behind the wisdom tooth a fourth premolar would easily have had space to develop. Since the third molar (the wisdom tooth) is present and its <b>dentin</b> exposed - although only in a few places - the age of death is estimated to be about 20 to 30 years.|$|E
