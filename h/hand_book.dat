2500|$|This {{collection}} {{is one of}} the world's most important examples of the Gothic Revival style; while the buildings' manner and design are unquestionably Gothic, they resemble no building constructed during the Middle Ages. The forms were the same, but their arrangement was uniquely modern. The parliament buildings also departed from the Medieval models by integrating a variety of eras and styles of Gothic architecture, including elements from Britain, France, the Low Countries, and Italy, all in three buildings. In his 1867 <b>Hand</b> <b>Book</b> to the Parliamentary and Departmental Buildings, Canada, Joseph Bureau wrote ...|$|E
2500|$|In his <b>Hand</b> <b>Book</b> to the Parliamentary and Departmental Buildings, Canada (1867), Joseph Bureau wrote, [...] "The {{style of}} the Buildings is the Gothic of the 12th and 13th Centuries, with {{modification}} to suit the climate of Canada. The ornamental work and the dressing round the windows are of Ohio sandstone. The plain surface is faced with a cream-colored sandstone of the Potsdam formation, obtained from Nepean, {{a few miles from}} Ottawa. The spandrils of the arches, and the spaces between window-arches and the sills of the upper windows, are filled up with a quaint description of stonework, composed of stones of irregular size, shape and colour, very neatly set together." ...|$|E
60|$|When {{first the}} Americans of the Northern States {{began to talk}} much of their country, their claims as to fine scenery were {{confined}} to Niagara and the Hudson River. Of Niagara I have spoken; and all the world has acknowledged that no claim made on that head {{can be regarded as}} exaggerated. As to the Hudson I am not prepared to say so much generally, though there is one spot upon it which cannot be beaten for sweetness. I have been up and down the Hudson by water, and confess that the entire river is pretty. But there is much of it that is not pre-eminently pretty among rivers. As a whole, it cannot be named with the Upper Mississippi, with the Rhine, with the Moselle, or with the Upper Rhone. The palisades just out of New York are pretty, and the whole passage through the mountains from West Point up to Catskill and Hudson is interesting. But the glory of the Hudson is at West Point itself; and thither on this occasion we went direct by railway, and there we remained for two days. The Catskill Mountains should be seen by a detour from off the river. We did not visit them, because here again the hotel was closed. I will leave them, therefore, for the new <b>hand</b> <b>book</b> which Mr. Murray will soon bring out.|$|E
