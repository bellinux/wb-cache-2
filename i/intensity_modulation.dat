40|$|Abstract—The p-Ge {{terahertz}} laser {{with flat}} external cavity mirrors exhibits <b>intensity</b> <b>modulations</b> at well-defined nonequidis-tant frequencies in the 8 – 80 -MHz range, resulting from beating of transverse modes.

40|$|Using {{the unique}} {{properties}} {{of the interaction between}} intense, short-pulse lasers and nanometer scale van-der-Waals bonded aggregates (or ‘clusters’), mod-ulated waveguides in hydrogen, argon and nitrogen plasmas were produced and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light was generated in deeply ionized nitrogen plasmas. A jet of clusters behaves as an array of mass-limited, solid-density targets with the average density of a gas. Two highly versatile experimental techniques are demonstrated for making preformed plasma waveguides with periodic structure within a laser-ionized cluster jet. The propagation of ultra-intense femtosecond laser pulses with intensities up to 2 × 1017 W/cm 2 has been experimentally demonstrated in waveguides generated using both methods, limited by available laser energy. The first uses a ‘ring grating’ to impose radial <b>intensity</b> <b>modulations</b> on the channel-generating laser pulse, which leads to axial <b>intensity</b> <b>modulations</b> at the laser focus within the cluster jet target.

50|$|<b>Intensity</b> <b>modulation</b> of SLEDs can {{be easily}} {{achieved}} through direct modulation of the bias current. SLED modules do not include terminating resistors inside because, operating at relatively high currents, excessive cooling {{would be required to}} compensate for the heat dissipation of the resistor. In order to achieve the best performance some external network that reduces the impedance mismatch between the driver amplifier, that usually requires 50 Ohm loads, and the low impedance of the chip (a few Ohm) would be preferable.

50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, the z-value of {{the positioning}} stage, when the modulation of the interference signal {{for a certain}} pixel is greatest, defines the height value for this pixel. Therefore, the quality {{and shape of the}} correlogram have a major influence on the system’s resolution and accuracy. The most important features of the light source are its wavelength and coherence length. The coherence length determines the width of the correlogram, which relies on the spectral width of the light source, as well as on structural aspects such as the spatial coherence of the light source and the numerical aperture (NA) of the optical system. The following discussion assumes that the dominant contribution to the coherence length is the emission spectrum. In Figure 4, you can see the spectral density function for a Gaussian spectrum, which is, for example, a good approximation for a light emitting diode (LED). The corresponding <b>intensity</b> <b>modulation</b> is shown to be substantial only in the neighborhood of position z0 where the reference and object beams have the same length and superpose coherently. The z-range of the positioning stage in which the envelope of <b>intensity</b> <b>modulation</b> is higher than 1/e of the maximum value determines the correlogram width. This corresponds to the coherence length because the difference of the optical path length is twice the length difference of the reference and measurement arms of the interferometer. The relationship between correlogram width, coherence length and spectral width is calculated for the case of a Gaussian spectrum.|$|E

For these test measurements at the new NRSE instrument RESEDA FRM II, Munich, we have employed CASCADE, {{one of the fastest}} neutron detectors in the world, developed at the University of Heidelberg.

5000|$|The vowels of Silbo Gomero are {{described}} roughly as sustained lines {{of high and}} low frequency that are distinct from each other. The high frequency /i/ vowel represents the [...] vowels of the spoken language being whistled, while the low frequency whistle of the dark /a/ vowel represents the vowels [...] It is said that {{it is not possible to}} produce any vowels with intermediary frequencies as the whistling mechanism does not have the same functions that the vocal mechanism possess. The theory that Silbo Gomero has only two vowels was theorised by Ramón Trujillo of the University of La Laguna in his published book [...] "EL SILBO GOMERO análisis lingüístico" [...] in 1978. His work, containing almost a hundred spectrograms, concludes in a theory that there are only two vowels and four consonants in the Silbo Gomero language. In Trujillo's work Silbo's vowels are given one quality, that of pitch, being either high or low. However, in a more recent study, the work of Julien Meyer (2005 - in French only (pg 100), 2008) gives a statistical analysis of the vowels of Silbo showing that there are 4 vowels statistically distinguished in production and that they are also perceived so.

50|$|The {{amplification}} of coherent terahertz {{sound in}} a Wannier-Stark ladder superlattice {{has been achieved}} in 2009 according to a paper publication from the School of Physics and Astronomy in the University of Nottingham. Wannier-Stark effect, exists in superlattices. Electron states in quantum wells respond sensitively to moderate electric fields either by the quantum confined Stark effect {{in the case of}} wide barriers or by Wannier-Stark localization {{in the case of a}} superlattice. Both effects lead to large changes of the optical properties near the absorption edge, which are useful for <b>intensity</b> <b>modulation</b> and optical switching. Namely, in a mathematical point of view, if an electric field is applied to a superlattice the relevant Hamiltonian exhibits an additional scalar potential. If an eigenstate exists, then the states corresponding to wave functions are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian as well. These states are equally spaced both in energy and real space and form the so-called Wannier-Stark ladder. In the proposed scheme, an application of an electrical bias to a semiconductor superlattice is increasing the amplitude of coherent folded phonons generated by an optical pulse. This increase of the amplitude is observed for those biases in which the energy drop per period of the superlattice is greater than the phonon energy. If the superlattice is biased such that the energy drop per period of the superlattice exceeds the width of electronic minibands (Wannier-Stark regime), the electrons become localized in the quantum wells and vertical electron transport takes place via hopping between neighboring quantum wells, which may be phonon assisted. As it had been shown previously, under these conditions stimulated phonon emission can become the dominant phonon-assisted hoping process for phonons of an energy value close to the Stark splitting. Thus, coherent phonon amplification is theoretically possible in this type of system. Together with the increase in amplitude, the spectrum of the bias-induced oscillations is narrower than the spectrum of the coherent phonons at zero bias. This shows that coherent amplification of phonons due to stimulated emission takes place in the structure under electrical pumping.|$|E
