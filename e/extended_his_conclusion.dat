40|$|Numerical {{experiments}} {{performed by}} Hoff 50 {{years ago on}} the application of Saint-Venant's principle to frameworks are <b>extended,</b> and <b>his</b> <b>conclusions</b> qualified. Guided by these results, a general treatment is formulated employing a state variable approach; this leads directly to an eigenvalue problem in which the decay rates are the eigenvalues of the cell transfer matrix. Unity eigenvalues correspond to the transmitting modes of rigid body displacement and the stress resultants of tension, bending moment, shearing force and twisting moment. Consideration of the associated eigenvectors and principal vectors gives exact values for the equivalent “continuum” beam properties of the framework, such as equivalent cross-sectional area, Poisson's ratio, second moment of area, shear coefficient and torsion constant...|$|R
2500|$|During late 1772 Lavoisier {{turned his}} {{attention}} to the phenomenon of combustion, the topic on which he was to make his most significant contribution to science. He reported the results of his first experiments on combustion in a note to the Academy on 20 October, in which he reported that when phosphorus burned, it combined with a large quantity of air to produce acid spirit of phosphorus, and that the phosphorus increased in weight on burning. In a second sealed note deposited with the Academy a few weeks later (1 November) Lavoisier <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> observations and <b>conclusions</b> to the burning of sulfur and went on to add that [...] "what is observed in the combustion of sulfur and phosphorus may well take place in the case of all substances that gain in weight by combustion and calcination: and I am persuaded that the increase in weight of metallic calces is due to the same cause." ...|$|R
