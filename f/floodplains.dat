40|$|A large river system {{typically}} derives {{the majority}} of its biomass from production within the <b>floodplain.</b> The Neches River in the Big Thicket National Preserve is a large blackwater river that has an extensive forested <b>floodplain.</b> Organic carbon was analyzed within the <b>floodplain</b> waters and the river (upstream and downstream of the <b>floodplain)</b> to determine the amount of organic carbon from the <b>floodplain</b> that is contributing to the nutrient dynamics in the river. Dissolved organic carbon was significantly higher at downstream river locations during high discharge. Higher organic carbon levels in the <b>floodplain</b> contributed to increases in organic carbon within the Neches River downstream of the <b>floodplain</b> when Neches River discharges exceeded 10, 000 cfs. Hurricane Rita passed through the Big Thicket National Preserve in September 2005. Dissolved organic carbon concentrations recorded after Hurricane Rita in the Neches River downstream of the <b>floodplain</b> were significantly higher than upstream of the <b>floodplain.</b> Dissolved organic carbon was twice as high after the hurricane than levels prior to the hurricane, with <b>floodplain</b> concentrations exceeding 50 ppm C. The increase in organic carbon was likely due to nutrients leached from leaves, which were swept from the <b>floodplain</b> trees prior to normal abscission in the fall. A continuum of leaf breakdown rates was observed in three common <b>floodplain</b> species of trees: Sapium sebiferum, Acer rubrum, and Quercus laurifolia. Leaves collected from blowdown as a result of Hurricane Rita did not break down significantly faster than leaves collected prior to abscission in the fall. Processing coefficients for leaf breakdown in a continuously wet area of the <b>floodplain</b> were significantly higher than processing coefficients for leaf breakdown on the <b>floodplain</b> floor. The forested <b>floodplain</b> of the Neches River is the main contributor of organic carbon.

5|$|The Clearfield-McIntyre Syncline {{runs through}} the western {{lower part of the}} Kettle Creek {{watershed}} in a southwest-to-northeast direction. North of this syncline lies the Wellsboro Anticline. South of it lies the Hyner Dome. A set of fractures in the watershed causes the tributary Huling Branch to have a straight and narrow valley and for Kettle Creek itself to make a sharp 90-degree turn near the mouth of the tributary Twomile Run. Lateral bars that are nearly or completely devoid of vegetation can be found throughout the main stem of Kettle Creek. In the southern reaches of the watershed, where Pennsylvanian-epoch sandstones are located, the creek flows through steep valleys with narrow <b>floodplains.</b> In the central and northern reaches of the watershed, the main rocks are Mississippian and Devonian rocks. This part of the watershed is characterized by wider <b>floodplains,</b> less steep valleys, and some plateaus, enabling agricultural and residential development to a limited extent.

40|$|The {{geomorphology}} {{and dynamics}} of the Mfolozi River <b>floodplain</b> and estuary, located in the subtropical region of northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, were considered with respect to existing models of avulsion and alluvial stratigraphy. The Mfolozi River <b>floodplain</b> may be divided into regions based on longitudinal slope and dominant geomorphic processes. Confinement of the Mfolozi River above the <b>floodplain</b> {{has led to the}} development of an alluvial fan at the <b>floodplain</b> head, characterized by a relatively high sedimentation rate and avulsion frequency, at a gradient of 0. 10 %. The lower <b>floodplain</b> is controlled by sea level, with an average gradient of 0. 05 %. Between the two lies an extremely flat region with an average gradient of 0. 02 %, which may be controlled by faulting of the underlying bedrock. Avulsion occurrences on the Mfolozi <b>floodplain</b> are linked to the two main zones of aggradation, the alluvial fan at the <b>floodplain</b> head, and toward the river mouth in the lower <b>floodplain.</b> On the alluvial fan, normal flow conditions result in scour from local steepening. During infrequent, large flood events, the channel becomes overwhelmed with sediment and stream flow, and avulses. The resulting avulsion is regional, and affects the location of the channel from the <b>floodplain</b> head to the river mouth. Deposits resulting from such avulsions contribute significantly to the total volume of sediment stored in the <b>floodplain,</b> and tend to persist for long periods after the avulsion. Contrastingly, on the lower <b>floodplain,</b> reaching of the avulsion threshold is not necessarily linked to large flood events, but rather to long-term aggradation on the channel that decreases the existing channels gradient while increasing its elevation above the surrounding <b>floodplain.</b> Resultant avulsions tend to be local and do not contribute significantly to the overall volume of <b>floodplain</b> alluvium...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Civil Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. The <b>floodplain</b> {{of a river}} forms a close {{relationship}} with the stream that created it. Not only does the river influence the characteristics of the <b>floodplain,</b> the <b>floodplain</b> can also very easily influence its river, as is evidenced by examples such as the Huang He River in China and the Columbia River in Canada. These two cases clearly indicate that suspended sediment has a pronounced influence on the <b>floodplain.</b> This thesis investigates the processes which cause sediment to move onto the <b>floodplain.</b> As observed in many rivers worldwide suspended sediment on the <b>floodplain</b> has a tendency to settle near but not directly next to the main river channel. This gap between the river channel and the location of highest sedimentation rate {{stems from the fact that}} there is a zone of relatively higher turbulence at the boundaries of the <b>floodplain.</b> Close to this zone flow on the <b>floodplain</b> is increased in velocity whilst the flow velocity in the main channel is decreased as can be seen in the figure below: [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{downstream}} peak discharge increase during hyperconcentrated {{floods in}} the Yellow River has {{been attributed to}} bed erosion, roughness reduction and <b>floodplain</b> effects. While great improvements have been made on the nderstandings of the roles of bed erosion and roughness reduction, the effects of <b>floodplain</b> remain poorly understood. Here, as a first step to reveal the <b>floodplain</b> effects, we present a numerical experimental study on how the channel-floodplain system reacts to a hyperconcentrated flood process. For this purpose, schematized channel-floodplain systems are designed and the classical 1992 flood record data is prescribed at the upstream boundary. By applying a fully coupled morphodynamic model, numerical experiments are conducted for a comprehensive analysis on the effects of bed erodibility, <b>floodplain</b> width, bed roughness variation, symmetry and longitudinal variability of geomorphology. Our results show two distinct trends for the response of channel- <b>floodplain</b> system depending on bed erodibility. For a small bed erodibility, both channel and <b>floodplain</b> experience erosion. For a moderate/large bed erodibility, only the channel experiences erosion whereas deposition occurs on the <b>floodplain.</b> The variation of the <b>floodplain</b> width does not affect these erosion-deposition behaviors while changing the magnitude and patterns of <b>floodplain</b> deposition. The longitudinally discontinuous channel-floodplain divided by either water storage areas or housing/farming banks diminishes the <b>floodplain</b> deposition at the discontinuous locations. The present numerical experiments do not show an obvious peak discharge increase, nonetheless, the recognized erosion-deposition characteristics would help further study of the <b>floodplain</b> effects on the peak of hyperconcentrated floods.
