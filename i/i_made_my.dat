All these things go through one's mind. Then if Michael had won...he would have had to ask me to join his government, and I didn't want that. I asked myself: why am I risking all this?

Of his five siblings, , his older brother Gabriel Zakuani plays for English club Northampton Town {{and is a member}} of the Congolese national team. He might have been able to play for the United States if granted citizenship. He expressed interest in representing the Congolese national team early in his professional career, but considered his chances of playing for England [...] "a long shot". Later in his career, he expressed interest in playing for the United States, saying, [...] "of the three, I prefer the States as this is where <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> name as a player".|$|E

[...] The lyrics contain direct {{references}} to Christianity, with Fantasia singing: [...] "Thank you for never leaving me Lord Jesus!". She continues to express her gratitude with the lyrics: [...] "You're the only one that never left me when everyone else just didn't care, you're the only one that really loved me. I made it.

500|$|American rapper Angel Haze has {{released}} one studio album, one internet album, two extended plays (EPs), four mixtapes and nineteen singles (including four as a featured artist and nine promotional singles). In July 2012, after releasing two prior mixtapes, Haze released a mixtape Reservation online for free. The title {{is inspired by}} the act of reserving a table at a restaurant, saying [...] " [...] For me, it's like that with the rap industry. <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> reservation there [...] and now I'm finally arriving". The lead single [...] "New York" [...] peaked at number 58 on the UK Singles Chart, and number 12 on the UK R Singles Chart. Shortly after, Haze released a commercial EP compiled of tracks from Reservation, titled New York, followed by a fourth mixtape, Classick. Throughout late 2013, during {{the run-up to the}} release of the debut album, Haze released a cover of a popular song every day, for thirty days. Most famous from these freestyles was the adaptation of Macklemore and Ryan Lewis's track [...] "Same Love", which discusses childhood, prejudice, homophobia and sexuality. The series was dubbed 30 Gold.|$|E

500|$|With the Nuremberg Trials {{underway}} and Japanese {{war crimes}} {{during the war}} coming to light, the announcement of Hashimoto's appearance in testimony against an American officer caused considerable controversy in the American news media. Though Hashimoto was himself known to be innocent of any war crimes and was generally treated well by his guards, he spoke little English and was subject to derision in the press. Among the public responses, socialite Evalyn Walsh McLean sent an angry telegram to Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal to complain, and U.S. Representative Robert L. Doughton publicly stated, [...] "It is the most contemptible thing I ever heard of to summon a Jap officer to testify against {{one of our own}} officers. <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> living practicing law before Navy courts and boards for 25 years, and this reaches an all-time low in courts, board or congressional investigation." [...] Columnist Robert Ruark accused the Navy of using Hashimoto to [...] "hype up" [...] the court martial. Even after his departure his testimony remained controversial, and the Chicago Sun criticized his trip, which it estimated to have cost $1,820.|$|E

He formally received the accolade at Buckingham Palace on 18 February 2009. Afterwards he said, [...] "You can't ask a fantasy writer not to want a knighthood. You know, for two pins I'd get myself a horse and a sword." [...] In late 2009, he did make himself a sword, {{with the help of his}} friends. He told a Times Higher Education interviewer that [...] "At the end of last year <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> own sword. I dug out the iron ore from a field about 10miles away – I was helped by interested friends. We lugged 80kilos of iron ore, used clay from the garden and straw to make a kiln, and lit the kiln with wildfire by making it with a bow.' Colin Smythe, his long-term friend and agent, donated some pieces of meteoric iron – 'thunderbolt iron' has a special place in magic and we put that in the smelt, and I remember when we sawed the iron apart it looked like silver. Everything about it I touched, handled and so forth ... And everything was as it should have been, it seemed to me." ...|$|E

[...] Between her junior and senior year of high school, she shaved her head and sold her hair to a Broadway wigmaker. She openly {{admitted}} to using drugs as a teenager, especially hallucinogens. She has commented that her father was aware of her experimentation with hallucinogens and marijuana, and even told her that it was okay, but that she had [...] "to stop if she had bad trips". Despite her father's leniency, her mother later chose to send her to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. In 2007, she told The Times that [...] "I had a great family life [...] I would never want it to look as if it reflected on them. I think I was very bored, and I did just love taking hallucinogens... but I often feel it's because I experimented when I was younger that I have no interest as an adult. I know a lot of adults who didn't, and it's much more dangerous when you start experimenting with drugs as an adult." [...] She often described herself as a [...] "loner" [...] and a [...] "depressed teenager". Her only extracurricular activity was occasionally skateboarding with her older brother, and she spent most of her free time in her bedroom: [...] "Mostly I sewed. I had nothing better to do, so <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> own clothes." ...|$|E

500|$|At the {{suggestion}} of manager Lenny Poncher and Hassinger, The Electric Prunes agreed to record a concept album that integrated Gregorian music into psychedelic pop, with the belief it would launch them into commercial success. Poncher recruited David Axelrod, a formally neo-classically trained musician, to compose all of the material for the project. The result, Mass in F Minor, was a complex arrangement of religious-based rock, which was sung entirely in Latin. Although the band did record the songs [...] "Kyrie Eleison", [...] "Gloria", and [...] "Credo", the intricate orchestration proved to be too difficult and time-consuming for the group. As a consequence, Hassinger enlisted the Canadian group, The Collectors, among other session musicians, in completing the album, although Lowe, Tulin, and Weakley did contribute to every track. Mass in F Minor was released in January 1968 and reached number 135 on the Billboard 200. An eerie version of the opening track, [...] "Kyrie Eleison", became somewhat of an underground favorite when it appeared in the soundtrack for the counterculture film, Easy Rider. The Electric Prunes performed with the new songs in concert just once, at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, which Tulin described: [...] "From the outset the performance was a disaster. We missed the intro on the first song and it never got any better. Amp speakers blew, charts fell off music stands and everyone was, in general, in a complete state of confusion. Ended up each song turned into one long jam. I think we were, at times, {{all in the same}} key. <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> way over to the four celli and four French horns and told them to 'jam in E.' Somehow we would hit a break and James would manage a vocal". As a result of financial and musical issues, Weakley and Lowe left the group in early 1968. Tulin and Williams finished a tour with a line-up that also included Kenny Loggins and Jeremy Stuart, but by mid-1968 they too departed the group.|$|E

[...] "Many of the songs I heard were not 'me'," [...] the singer stated during a promotional interview with Jet in 1999, [...] "And If I can't feel it, then I won't sing it. I'm not the little girl I was when <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>my</b> first record. My voice is a strong instrument now; my vocals come from both my heart and my diaphragm.
