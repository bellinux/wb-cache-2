Then we explore the impact of computer-generated humans on medical research and education. In the area of orthopedics, we discuss the simulation of motion with <b>joint</b> <b>illness</b> and prosthesis. We then explain the simulation of effects of plastic surgery and facial deformations on facial motion and speech. In surgery, a graphics database of organs combined {{with the impact of}} Virtual Reality may lead to surgical interventions in a virtual world. Psychiatry research may also find new important tools in behavioral and knowledge-based animation research. Finally, we explain the next generation of patients: virtual people with real virtual bones and soft tissues...|$|E
40|$|The {{narratives}} individuals {{told about}} their experiences with an illness {{they have come to}} understand as TMJ, a problem linked to the temporomandibular joints of the jaw, are complex. Each is embedded within a unique set of life circumstances and guided by individual schemas and explanatory models. Each recounts how persons have come to make sense of perplexing symptoms that are not easily categorized and treated within the North American health care system. Yet, in spite of their distinctiveness, the reconstructed narratives are not independent of shared cultural schemas, such as those relating to mind and body, and other shared models, such as the model for TMJ, which individuals come to adopt as a consequence of treatment and interaction with others. The consistent emergence of themes concerning the mind and body within and across narratives attest to their salience for understanding the narratives related here. While describing the effect of illness on individual lives, narratives also illuminate how shared understandings shape the interpretation and construction of individual experience. temporomandibular <b>joint</b> <b>illness</b> narratives cultural models explanatory models...|$|E
40|$|Osteoarthritis is {{a common}} <b>joint</b> <b>illness</b> {{affecting}} both sexes, all ages and races. It causes pain, physical impairment, and decline of competence in daily life. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of osteoarthritis, demographic characteristics, radiologic signs and involved joints in Al-Zahra and Kashani hospitals of Esfahan during the year 1999. This descriptive and cross-sectional study was performed on 3340 patients selected by simple sampling. Age, sex, weight, lob, type of physical activity, involved joints, duration, radiologic changes, treatment type, background diseases and type of osteoarthritis were recorded for every patient. The results showed that 70 % of the cases were female, more than 50 % were over 55 years old. More than 50 % had idiopathic osteoarthritis, and most of them had common activity. Knee joint involvement was the most prevalent and the joint sac narrowing was the most frequent radiologic sign. Most of them had received non-surgical medical treatment. It seems that feminine sex, aging, inappropriate use of joints and high level activity are the risk factors of osteoarthritis and in most patients non-surgical medical treatment is enough...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Epidemics of {{chikungunya}} fever, an Aedes spp. -borne viral disease, affected {{hundreds of}} thousands of people in western Indian Ocean islands and India during 2005 – 2006. The initial outbreaks occurred in coastal Kenya (Lamu, then Mombasa) in 2004. We investigated eco-climatic conditions associated with chikungunya fever emergence along coastal Kenya using epidemiologic investigations and satellite data. Unusually dry, warm conditions preceded the outbreaks, including the driest since 1998 for some of the coastal regions. Infrequent replenishment of domestic water stores and elevated temperatures may have facilitated Chikungunya virus transmission. These results suggest that drought-affected populations may be at heightened risk for chikungunya fever, and underscore the need for safe water storage during drought relief operations. Transmitted by Aedes spp. mosquitoes, Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) causes febrile <b>illness</b> with <b>joint</b> pain. <b>Illness</b> is rarely fatal but can be severe and prolonged, and lead to other complications. Sylvan transmission cycles involving forest-dwelling Aedes spp. and wild primates maintain endemicity throughout tropical Africa.

40|$|Thesis (M. Nurs.), College of Nursing, Washington State UniversityChildhood obesity has {{increased}} three fold since the 1960 's. In the United States, 12. 5 million children and teens {{are affected by}} obesity. The highest childhood obesity rates are associated with low family incomes and low head of household education. Childhood obesity has both immediate and long-term harmful effects. Obese {{children are more likely}} to have hypertension, abnormal glucose tolerance, increased incidence in respiratory <b>illnesses,</b> <b>joint</b> problems, gallstones, fatty liver and psychosocial issues. Current guidelines established by the American Academy of Pediatrics on the assessment, prevention, and treatment of childhood obesity address the recommendations of the problem. However, they do not take into consideration the special circumstances of children living in poverty. Children living in poverty are limited by economic resources, potential unsafe neighborhoods, and genetic predispositions to obesity.

40|$|Abstract Background Neurofibromatosis is a {{syndrome}} {{caused by}} the abnormal deposition of neural tissues of the nervous system, endocrine system, visceral structures, and skin. On the other hand, pectus carinatum and temporomandibular <b>joint</b> dysfunction are <b>illnesses</b> that adversly affect the respiratory system and cause additional problems in airway management. Case Presentation Fifty-eight-year-old Turkish male patient had neurofibromatosis, pectus carinatum and temporomandibular joint dysfunction. The case was due to be operated on with the diagnosis of incarcerated umbilical hernia. Spinal anesthesia was successfully performed and {{the duration of the}} surgery was 1 hour. No postoperative complications were observed and he was discharged from the hospital on the 3 rd post-operative day. Conclusion The anesthetic management of patients with neurofibromatosis requires attention to all possible abnormalities and associated disturbances. Furthermore, the presence of pectus carinatum and temporomandibular joint dysfunction also increase the potential risks. The operation was successfully completed with spinal anesthesia that was carefully applied upon taking the required measures and considering all pathologies that may accompany the case and complications that may occur. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: {{this study}} {{reports on a}} {{feasibility}} trial in which the LivDem model of group support for people affected by dementia was trialled within a Primary Care, IAPT setting. Methodology: five people affected by dementia and their carers were recruited into the study, although one man withdrew before the start due to <b>illness.</b> <b>Joint</b> sessions were held on {{the first and the}} final meetings, with parallel group sessions for people affected by dementia and their carers for the remaining eight sessions. One person affected by dementia and their carer withdrew due to illness {{before the end of the}} sessions. Results: a self-report measure of Quality of Life suggested improvements for two of the three people affected by dementia who completed all of the sessions. The proxy ratings of carers indicated improvements for all three participants. Qualitative interviews were carried out with participants and carers to assess acceptability. Discussion: the improvement in QoL-AD scores of participants are consistent with that found for the LivDem intervention within secondary care. At the same time, concerns remain about the fit between the LivDem intervention and the way in which Primary care psychology is structured particularly if therapists are not actively supported by a dementia specialist and if a parallel carers’ group is not run...|$|R

25|$|These {{days there}} is not much disputing that Ixodes holocyclus is the main vector for Rickettsial Spotted Fever (also known as Queensland tick typhus) (causative {{organism}} the bacteria Rickettsia australis) and Flinders Island Spotted Fever (causative organism Rickettsia honei). Rickettsia australis is an obligate, intracellular bacterial parasite that proliferates within the endothelial cells of small blood vessels, causing a vasculitis. Spotted Fever is probably more common than the Lyme-like Disease. Sometimes infection with Rickettsia australis occurs without a rash - there may just be a high fever. Usually (65% of cases) there is a black spot (known as an eschar, usually 2–5mm in diameter) {{at the site of the}} tick bite. This looks like a scab with redness and swelling around it. Usually there is only one eschar unless there has been more than one tick bite. Often lymph glands nearby are enlarged and painful. Fever starts 1–14 days (usually 7–10 days) following the tick bite, followed within a few days by a rash. The rash can look like chicken pox as the spots may contain some fluid. Other symptoms include headache, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, mental confusion, aching muscles and <b>joints.</b> The <b>illness</b> may be more severe in adults and elderly persons. Spotted Fever is diagnosed by two blood tests (IgM and Weil-Felix tests) taken 10 days apart. PCR analysis of skin biopsies is a more recent testing method. The disease runs its course in two weeks or so but can be cured more quickly with antibiotics (tetracyclines). As antibiotic treatment is very effective, many persons feel so well that they do not return to have the second blood sample collected. But this second blood test is important as it is the only way of proving the diagnosis of Spotted Fever. Spotted Fever rarely, if ever, occurs more than once because the body usually becomes immune for life. In rare instances there may be an apparent repeated infection after recovery - it is not known whether this is caused by another strain. It is also presently unknown if chronic infections occur. It is rarely fatal. Australian Spotted Fever was first described in 1946 when 12 soldiers contracted the disease during training exercises in north Queensland - it was at that time known as Queensland Tick Typhus (QTT). Infections generally arise in rural areas, but 10% of reported cases appear to have been acquired in major cities. It is apparently commonly seen in tick collectors in southern Queensland. It mostly occurs during the winter and spring, but can occur at any time in temperate areas.|$|R
40|$|Many {{studies have}} {{examined}} either electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency activity or gray matter volumes (GMV) in various psychoses (including schizophrenia, schizoaffective and psychotic bipolar disorder). Prior work demonstrated similar EEG and gray matter abnormalities in both schizophrenia and psychotic bipolar disorder. Integrating EEG and GMV and jointly analyzing the combined data fully elucidates the linkage between the two and may provide better biomarker- or endophenotype-specificity for a particular <b>illness.</b> <b>Joint</b> exploratory investigations of EEG and GMV are scarce in the literature {{and the relationship between}} the two in psychosis is even less explored. We investigated a joint multivariate model to test whether the linear relationship or linkage between awake EEG (AEEG) frequency activity and GMV is abnormal across the psychosis dimension and if such effects are also present in first-degree relatives. We assessed 607 subjects comprising 264 probands (105 schizophrenia (SZ), 72 schizoaffective (SZA) and 87 psychotic bipolar disorder (PBP)), 233 of their first degree relatives (82 SZ relatives (SZR), 71 SZA relatives (SZAR) and 80 PBP relatives (PBPR)) and 110 healthy comparison subjects (HC). All subjects underwent structural MRI (sMRI) and EEG scans. Frequency activity and voxel based morphometric GMV were derived from EEG and sMRI data respectively. Seven AEEG frequency and gray matter components were extracted using Joint independent component analysis (jICA). The loading coefficients (LC) were examined for group differences using analysis of covariance. Further, the LCs were correlated with psychopathology scores to identify relationship with clinical symptoms. Joint ICA revealed a single component differentiating SZ from HC (p< 0. 006), comprising increased posterior alpha activity associated with decreased volume in inferior parietal lobe, supra-marginal, parahippocampal gyrus, middle frontal, inferior temporal gyri and increased volume of uncus and culmen. No components were aberrant in either PBP or SZA or any relative group. No significant association was identified with clinical symptom measures. Our data suggest that a joint EEG and GMV model yielded a biomarker specific to SZ, not abnormal in PBP or SZA. Alpha activity was related to both increased and decreased volume in different cortical structures. Additionally, the joint model failed to identify endophenotypes across psychotic disorders...|$|R
