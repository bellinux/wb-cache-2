40|$|The {{pursuit of}} reduced {{greenhouse}} gas emissions, {{as well as}} the increased share of renewable fuels in the overall energy balance has led to a search for alternative energy sources. One of the fuels on which great hopes are set as fuel for engines is biomethane or biogas, whose main component is methane. Biogas can be obtained from different products by using different technologies, so that it has potential as a widely-available fuel, which is quite easy to produce. The percentage of methane in biogas depends on the technology for obtaining biogas and ranges from 35 % to around 75 %. The largest biogas sources can be animal farms, where it is obtained from animal excrement. Another source is sewage treatment plants and rubbish dumps, where substantial quantities of biogas are obtained as a result of natural processes occurring in waste dumping sites or sewage. Biogas can also be acquired from waste obtained from fruit and vegetable processing as well as waste from meat plants. This paper examines the possibility of using biogas as a fuel for diesel engines. In these engines, the combustion of biogas (methane) requires the application of a <b>dual-fuel</b> <b>supply</b> system in which liquid fuel initiating gas fuel self-ignition will be injected into the combustion chamber along with methane. The paper also contains example results showing the effect of the methane dose on the course of the combustion process in diesel engines...|$|E
5|$|Flexible-fuel {{vehicles}} (FFVs) {{are based}} on <b>dual-fuel</b> systems that <b>supply</b> both fuels into the combustion chamber {{at the same time}} in various calibrated proportions. The most common fuels used by FFVs today are unleaded gasoline and ethanol fuel. Ethanol FFVs can run on pure gasoline, pure ethanol (E100) or any combination of both. Methanol has also been blended with gasoline in flex-fuel vehicles known as M85 FFVs, but their use has been limited mainly to demonstration projects and small government fleets, particularly in California.|$|R
40|$|Article {{presents}} simulated {{research and}} visualization of combustion process of four-cylinder test engine {{based on the}} spark ignition engine Toyota Yaris 1. 300 cm 3, equipped with two systems of power supply i. e. : fundamental and ignition. Two methods of initiating the combustion process were applied in the engine, that is: from spark ignition and after it has turned off – the combustion is initiated {{by means of the}} injection of the ignition dose. The conducted research was aimed at revealing the differences in the combustion process and the engine performance, especially the changes of pressure in the cylinder for that kind of <b>dual-fuel</b> power engine <b>supply.</b> The ignition dose injected to cylinder was equal to about 5 % of the general mass of the fuel given to the engine. The mass of the fuel injected to the infold manifold determined the remaining part, and direct injection of fuel took place for several dozen rotation degrees of the crankshaft before TDC (Top Dead Centre). A spatial grid of the engine’s model (preprocessor) was created as well as the modification of the source KIVA 3 V program was executed, consisting of taking into account two systems of injection. It is necessary to mention, that KIVA 3 V program contains only one source of fuel’s injection as a default. On two-dimensional graphs, the courses of changes of pressure and temperature are presented as well as the change of the mass of the injected ignition dose. A simulation was conducted for chosen rotation angles of the crankshaft, for the purpose of a radical analysis of thermodynamic parameters along with an analysis of the toxic components of the exhaust fumes. The conclusions of the conducted simulated research confirm the reduction of fuel consumption with a simultaneous reduction of the emissions of toxic exhaust fumes components...|$|R
