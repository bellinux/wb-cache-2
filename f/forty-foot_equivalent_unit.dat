2500|$|Container {{capacity}} is often expressed in {{twenty-foot equivalent unit}}s (TEU, or sometimes teu). A twenty-foot equivalent unit {{is a measure of}} containerized cargo capacity equal to one standard [...] long container. This is an approximate measure, wherein the height of the box is not considered. For example, the [...] tall high-cube, as well as [...] containers are equally counted as one TEU. Similarly, extra long [...] containers are commonly designated as two TEU, no different than standard [...] long units. Two TEU are equivalent to one <b>forty-foot</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>unit</b> (FEU).|$|E

50|$|Container City is {{the name}} given to two pieces of {{shipping}} container architecture in east London.

50|$|The rebuilt railway's revenue freight {{rolling stock}} {{consists}} of 5-well, articulated, double-stack container railcars with bulkheads. The 265-foot-long car sets were built by Gunderson Inc. and each car set can hold ten 40 foot containers. The bottom level in each well can hold two 20 foot containers {{instead of one}} 40 foot unit. The intermodal terminals at each end can accommodate trains of 11 of these cars, which carry a total of up to 110 <b>forty-foot</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>units</b> (FEUs).|$|R
50|$|The forty-foot {{containers}} {{have found}} wider acceptance, {{as they can}} be pulled by semi-trailer truck. The length of such a combination is within the limits of national road regulations in many countries, requiring no special permission. As some road regulations allow longer trucks, there are also variations of the standard forty-foot container — in Europe and most other places a container of 45 ft may be pulled as a trailer. Containers with a length of 48 ft or 53 ft are restricted to road transport in the United States. Although longer than 40 feet, these variants are put in the same class of <b>forty-foot</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
25|$|The ships {{have five}} holds fitted with tweendecks, four {{forwards}} and one abaft of the superstructure, {{with a total}} grain capacity of 31,181 cubic metres. The foremost hold, No. 1, is specially designed for the carriage of explosives for the mining industry, inflammable liquids and chemicals in packages, {{and for this reason}} has a separate seawater fire extinguishing system that {{can also be used to}} cool the bulkhead between the foremost holds. Lower holds No. 2, 3 and 4 are designed for bulk cargoes such as coal, ore and grain. Containers can be carried in all holds and on the hatch covers, and the total container capacity of the SA-15 class ships is 576 twenty-foot <b>equivalent</b> <b>units,</b> forty of which can be refrigerated, or 236 <b>forty-foot</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>units.</b> In addition the ships can carry special ten-foot ore concentrate containers in holds No. 2, 3 and 4, with two layers on tank top and one on tweendeck.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} {{intermodal container}} is designated as twenty {{feet long and}} 8 ft wide. Additionally there is a standard container with the same width but a doubled length of forty feet called a 40-foot container, which equals one <b>forty-foot</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>unit</b> (often FEU or feu) in cargo transportation (considered to be two TEU, see below).|$|E
5000|$|As the TEU is an inexact unit, it {{cannot be}} {{converted}} precisely into other units. The related unit <b>forty-foot</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>unit,</b> however, {{is defined as}} two TEU. The most common dimensions for a 20 ft container are 20 ft long, 8 ft wide, and 8 ft high, for a volume of [...] However, both 9 ft High cube and 4 ft half height containers are also reckoned as 1 TEU. [...] This gives a volume range of [...] for one TEU.|$|E
50|$|Container {{capacity}} is often expressed in {{twenty-foot equivalent unit}}s (TEU, or sometimes teu). A twenty-foot equivalent unit {{is a measure of}} containerized cargo capacity equal to one standard 20 ft long container. This is an approximate measure, wherein the height of the box is not considered. For example, the 9 ft tall high-cube, as well as 4 ft half-height 20 ft containers are equally counted as one TEU. Similarly, extra long 45 ft containers are commonly designated as two TEU, no different than standard 40 ft long units. Two TEU are equivalent to one <b>forty-foot</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>unit</b> (FEU).|$|E
50|$|The {{economic}} {{advantage of the}} project {{is that it will}} eliminate transshipment costs at import and export ports, as well as the long road journeys to reach these ports, thereby offering significant cost savings in the overall freight charge. Barges can be loaded directly close to the point of manufacture, and discharged within a couple of hundred kilometres of the final point of delivery. Transport cost savings are estimated at more than US$1,000 per FEU (<b>forty-foot</b> <b>equivalent</b> container).|$|R
