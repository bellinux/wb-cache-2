2500|$|Somalia is a {{semi-arid}} {{country with}} about 1.64% arable land. The first local environmental organizations were Ecoterra Somalia and the Somali Ecological Society, {{both of which}} helped promote awareness about ecological concerns and mobilized environmental programs in all governmental sectors {{as well as in}} civil society. From 1971 onwards, a massive tree-planting campaign on a nationwide scale was introduced by the Siad Barre government to halt the advance of thousands of acres of wind-driven sand dunes that threatened to engulf towns, roads and farm land. By 1988, 265 hectares of a projected 336 hectares had been treated, with 39 range reserve sites and 36 forestry plantation sites established. In 1986, the Wildlife Rescue, Research and Monitoring Centre was established by Ecoterra <b>Intl.,</b> with the goal of sensitizing the public to ecological issues. This educational effort led in 1989 to the so-called [...] "Somalia proposal" [...] and a decision by the Somali government to adhere to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which established {{for the first time a}} worldwide ban on the trade of elephant ivory.|$|E
