Later, Liz has a {{conversation}} with her mother Margaret Lemon (Anita Gillette) regarding Liz being single. During their conversation, Margaret reveals that her true love was Buzz Aldrin and not Liz's father Dick Lemon (Buck Henry), which shocks Liz. She tells Jack about what her mother has revealed to her and ponders why her mother did not choose to be with Buzz. Jack offers to introduce her to Buzz with Liz accepting, and wanting {{to find out what}} her mother missed out on. During their meet, Buzz confesses that it was a <b>good</b> <b>decision</b> that Margaret did not stay with him as he spent many of his years as an alcoholic.

FIFA had insisted at the time of the incident that, since selection of referees for the World Cup referee was based on long-term assessments, Hansson would probably make it to the finals.

25|$|After {{moving to}} Nashville, Jackson became a protege of William Blount, {{a friend of}} the Donelsons {{and one of the most}} {{powerful}} men in the state. Jackson became attorney general in 1791, and he won election as a delegate to the Tennessee constitutional convention in 1796. When Tennessee achieved statehood that year, he was elected its only U.S. Representative. The following year, the state legislature elected him as U.S. Senator. He resigned within a year. While in Philadelphia, then the nation's capital, Jackson aligned himself with the Democratic-Republican Party, and he strongly opposed the Jay Treaty. In 1798, with strong support from western Tennessee, he was elected to serve as a judge of the Tennessee Supreme Court, at an annual salary of $600. Jackson's service as a judge is generally viewed as a success and earned him a reputation for honesty and <b>good</b> <b>decision</b> making. Jackson resigned the judgeship in 1804 and returned full-time to his business interests. His official reason for resigning was ill health. He had been suffering financially from poor land ventures, and so it is also possible that he wanted to return full-time to his business interests.|$|E
25|$|The AIF took a {{break at}} this point with no matches between Monday, 10 and Wednesday, 20 August inclusive. They {{returned}} to action on Thursday, 21 August at Southchurch Park in Southend, playing Essex until Saturday, 23 August. Johnny Douglas won the toss and put the AIF in to bat. It looked a <b>good</b> <b>decision</b> as he took seven for 50 himself with his fast-medium pace and the Australians were all out for only 130. Essex were 101 for six at the close and reached 151 on the second morning, Gregory and Collins again bowling in tandem and taking four apiece. The Australians started again before lunch and this time their batting excelled with Taylor scoring 146 and Murray 82. From 362 for five overnight, Collins was able to declare at 447 for eight on the Saturday morning. Douglas took four more wickets, but this time conceding 168 runs, giving him eleven wickets in the match. In the fourth innings, the early Essex batsmen were no match for Gregory who took all the first five wickets, leaving the county on 22 for five. They eventually reached 117 and the Australians were easy winners in the end by 309 runs.|$|E

Describing this evolution, Carpenter comments, [...] "When I first started playing Cordelia, she wasn't nice. She has really deepened and has a stronger sense of responsibility. She's a team player, which was not the case in the beginning." [...] Carpenter cherishes what playing a multi-faceted character like Cordelia meant for her as an actress, describing The road Cordelia has travelled, the journey she has taken up to now has been such a joy to play as an actress, because {{there have been so many}} chances to do so many different emotions. Heroic, vulnerable, just angry, possessed, funny [...] I get to be all those different things rolled into one. Getting this role, in hindsight...

500|$|For the {{upcoming}} God of War title, Barlog explained that Kratos {{had to change}} his cycle of violence {{and learn how to}} control his rage. He said that Kratos had made many bad decisions, which led to the destruction of Olympus, and wanted to know what would happen if Kratos made a <b>good</b> <b>decision.</b> The birth of Barlog's own son influenced the idea of Kratos' character change. The canceled live-action Star Wars television series was also an influence. The bond between Kratos and his son {{is at the heart of}} the game and Barlog said [...] "This game is about Kratos teaching his son how to be a god, and his son teaching Kratos how to be human again." [...] Referencing the Marvel Comics character Hulk, Barlog said that in regards to Kratos, [...] "We've already told the story of The Hulk. We want to tell the story of Banner now." [...] Christopher Judge, best known as Teal'c from Stargate SG-1, replaces T.C. Carson as the voice of Kratos in the game; Carson had voiced Kratos since the original God of War.

500|$|The {{decision}} for cooperative gameplay was made part-way through development, {{for a new}} experience in a Resident Evil game. Despite initial concern that a second player would dampen the game's tension and horror, it was later realized that this could actually increase such factors where one player had to be rescued. The decision to retain wide-screen proportions in two-player mode was made to avoid having the first player's screen directly {{on top of the}} second, which might be distracting, and the restriction on simultaneously moving and shooting was retained to increase player tension by not allowing them to maneuver freely. Takeuchi cited the film Black Hawk Down as an influence on the setting of [...] Resident Evil 5 and his experience working on Lost Planet: Extreme Condition as an influence on its development. When questioned as to why the game was not being released on the Wii, which was the most popular gaming console at the time, Takeuchi responded that although that may have been a <b>good</b> <b>decision</b> [...] "from a business perspective", the Wii was not the best choice in terms of power and visual quality, concluding that he was happy with the console choices they had made.|$|E

There were occasional redbed vestiges at the shale-basement contact and bitumen veining. Many wells proved expensive due to lost circulation in Paleocene-Cretaceous carbonates and caving in underlying Late Cretaceous shales. This was {{so severe that}} the Sarir field was nearly bypassed because oil was not anticipated in the Nubian Formation. However BP's chief geologist insisted a basement core be taken in every well.
