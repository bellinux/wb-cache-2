It highlights the speed differential between the Naval Communications Processing and Routing Systems's (NACOMPARS) processing subsystems and the multichannel broadcast's transmission lines.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a new control strategy for highly loaded anaerobic digestion processes. This strategy {{is based on}} the analysis of disturbances added on purpose to the influent flow rate. The control system then carefully overlooks the response of only two parameters, the biogas output flow rate and the pH, in order {{to determine whether or not}} the load can be increased. The main advantages of this approach rely on its capability to automatically adapt the <b>input</b> flow <b>rate</b> to changes in the influ-ent concentration, without any information on its concentration, and to optimize the biological treat-ment in relation to the influent degradability. Experiments have been carried out using two fluidized bed reactors of dierent sizes and they have demonstrated very good capability of this control strategy. In addition, since only very simple sensors are needed, industrial applications of this strategy can be expected. # 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We measured soil nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions and methane (CH 4) uptake using manual static chambers in an apple orchard. The primary aims were to assess the effect of N fertilizer application on gas fluxes and quantify the site-specific N 2 O emission factor (EFd). Field experiments were arranged in a randomized block design with three N <b>input</b> <b>rates</b> (0, 800 and 2600 / 2000 kg N ha− 1 year− 1). We found that orchard soils were a negligible CH 4 sink (− 1. 1 to − 0. 4 kg C ha− 1 year− 1). Annual N 2 O emissions responded positively to N <b>input</b> <b>rates,</b> ranging from 34. 1 to 60. 3 kg N ha− 1 year− 1. EFd ranged from 1. 00 % to 1. 65 % {{with a mean of}} 1. 34 %. The extremely large background emissions of N 2 O (34. 1 – 34. 3 kg N ha− 1 year− 1) most likely originated from nitrate accumulation in the soil profile because of historical overuse of N fertilizer.

A total of 41 benthic algal taxa was collected, belonging to the groups Cyanobacteria (4 taxa), Bacillariophyceae (33), Rhodophyta (1), Chrysophyceae (1) and Chlorophyta (2). At the shaded site, periphyton dry mass ranged from 13 g m− 2 in April to 440 g m− 2 in August (annual mean = 93 g m− 2), at the sunny site from 3 g m− 2 in May to 512 g m− 2 in late fall (annual mean = 70 g m− 2). Based on the algal carotenoid pattern, Bacillariophyceae were most abundant in fall and winter while Chlorophyceae dominated during summer. Mean annual standing stock of chlorophyll-a was 8. 65 μg cm− 2 at the shaded station and 7. 53 μg cm− 2 at the sunny site. Annual allochthonous CPOM <b>input</b> <b>rates</b> ranged from 382 to 665 g dry mass m− 2 for aerial input and from 1006 to 1062 g DM m− 1 of stream length for lateral <b>input.</b> Lateral <b>input</b> <b>rates</b> were influenced by the bank inclination; the temporal distribution of aerial input showed an autumnal maximum (61 – 65 % of the total).
