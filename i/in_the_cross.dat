5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>cross</b> country events, {{the heat}} of 45°C (113°F), caused all but 15 of the 38 {{competitors}} to abandon the race. Eight finishers were taken away on stretchers. One athlete began to run in tiny circles after reaching the stadium, until setting off into the stands and knocking himself unconscious. Early leader Wide {{was among those who}} blacked out along the course, and was incorrectly reported to have died at the hospital. Nurmi exhibited only slight signs of exhaustion after beating Ritola to the win by nearly a minute and a half. As Finland looked to have lost the team medal, the disoriented Liimatainen staggered into the stadium, but was barely moving forward. An athlete ahead of him fainted 50 metres from the finish, and Liimatainen stopped and tried to find his way off the track, thinking he had reached the finish line. After having ignored shouts and kept the spectators in suspense for a while, he turned into the right direction, realised his situation and reached the finish in 12th place and secured team gold. Those present at the stadium were shocked by what they had witnessed, and Olympic officials decided to ban cross country running from future Games.|$|E
5|$|The main winner <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cross</b> country {{events was}} Norway with seven medals, {{including}} five golds, {{all in the}} men's events. Petter Northug of Norway won three golds, earning them in the 15km + 15km double pursuit, 50km, and 4 x 10km relay. His teammate, Ola Vigen Hattestad, won golds in the individual and team sprint events. Estonia's Andrus Veerpalu became the oldest winner at 38 in the men's 15km event. Kristin Størmer Steira was Norway's only medal in the women's events with a silver in the 7.5km + 7.5km double pursuit event. For the women's events, the biggest winner was Finland's Aino-Kaisa Saarinen with four medals, including three golds (Team sprint, 10km, and 4 x 5km relay) and one bronze (7.5km + 7.5km double pursuit). Poland's Justyna Kowalczyk won three medals at the championships with two golds (7.5km + 7.5km double pursuit and 30km) and a bronze (10km). The only gold not awarded to either Kowalczyk or Saarinen was the women's individual sprint won by Italy's Arianna Follis. In that same event, Kikkan Randall became the first American woman to medal in cross country skiing {{at the world championships}} with her silver.|$|E

40|$|Starting with {{a complex}} {{commutative}} semi-simple regular Banach algebra A and an automorphism σ of A, we form <b>the</b> <b>crossed</b> product of A with the integers, where the latter act on A via iterations of σ.

25|$|The Kettle Creek {{area was}} part of the massive lumbering {{operation}} that occurred in most of north central Pennsylvania in the 1880s and 1890s.

The land was no longer useful to the lumber industry and it fell into disuse. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania purchased much of the land and Ole Bull State Park was opened in 1925.|$|E

Winslow prepared a series of detailed architectural models called maquettes to explore the design of the Grand Staircase and how it related to the Entrance Hall and Cross Hall. The paired Doric columns were retained, and an opening <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cross</b> Hall looking into the Grand Staircase were unanimously agreed upon.|$|E
25|$|For {{much of the}} period, a large jewelled {{cross is}} {{recorded}} as decorating the presumed site of the Crucifixion, around which the Church of the Holy Sepulchre had been built.

The crux gemmata first appears after what {{was believed to be}} the finding of the True Cross by the Empress Helena, mother of Constantine in the early 4th century, when interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>cross</b> greatly increased. The paradox whereby the instrument of execution is rendered the vehicle of Christ's triumph in the Resurrection remains to the present day a central theme in Christian devotion, and the jewelled cross was one of its first visual manifestations.|$|E
