Roughly a decade will be spent identifying, designing, and demonstrating new technologies before an analysis of alternatives is issued in 2024. An initial small team has been formed to consult with industry and identify the threat environment and technologies the submarine will need to operate against in the 2050-plus timeframe. One area already identified {{is the need to}} integrate with off-board systems so future Virginia boats and the SSN(X) can employ networked, extremely long-ranged weapons. A torpedo propulsion system concept from the Pennsylvania State University could allow a torpedo to hit a target [...] away and be guided by another asset during the terminal phase. Targeting information might also come from another platform like a patrol aircraft or an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) launched from the submarine. Researchers have identified a quieter advanced propulsion system and the ability to control multiple unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) at once as key SSN(X) components. [...] The future submarines will operate {{through the end of the}} 21st century, and potentially into the 22nd century. New propulsion technology, moving beyond the use of a rotating mechanical device to push the boat through the water, could come in the form a biomimetic propulsion system that would eliminate noise-generating moving parts like the drive shaft and the spinning blades of the propulsor.|$|E

5000|$|The {{rationale}} for the decision to change the medium of instruction from the Malay Language to English for {{the teaching and learning}} of Science and Mathematics subjects was made based on the government’s concern on the nation’s human capital development towards achieving the standard of a developed country, as well as an <b>early</b> <b>preparation</b> to compete in the era of globalization.It is widely known that the field of science and mathematics form the basis and have {{a crucial role in the}} progress and development of a country.

Thanks to his keen eye and experience on the tour he was able to distinguish between the [...] "modern" [...] method as Tilden referred to it and the traditional techniques and so-called conventional wisdom of tennis instruction, and set out to devise a more effective approach. His system of teaching tennis is {{based on the premise that}} players at every age and ability level can and should use the same basic techniques employed by the top players in the game, hence his motto [...] "Play Like The Pros". The system is based on allowing the player to use instinct and natural movement together with fundamental techniques that emulate the best strokes of the all-time great players in tennis. These fundamentals include an emphasis on open stance, highly developed hand-eye coordination, impeccable timing characterized by waiting rather than <b>early</b> <b>preparation</b> of the stroke, and absence of self-conscious emphasis on footwork. The simplicity of the method is summed in the phrase [...] "Find, Feel, Finish".|$|E
