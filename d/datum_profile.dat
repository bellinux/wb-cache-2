40|$|This paper {{shows how}} it is {{possible}} {{to reduce the number of}} blades in LP turbines by approximately 15 % relative to the first generation of high lift blading employed in the very latest engines. This is achieved through an understanding of the behaviour of the boundary layers on high lift and ultra high lift profiles subjected to incoming wakes. Initial development of the new profiles was carried out by attaching a flap to the trailing edge of one blade in a linear cascade. The test facility allows for the simulation of upstream wakes by using a moving bar system. Hot wire measurements were made to obtain boundary layer losses and surface mounted hot films were used to observe the changes in boundary layer state. Measurements were taken at a Reynolds number between 100, 000 and 210, 000. The effect of increased lift above the <b>datum</b> <b>profile</b> was investigated first with steady and then with unsteady inflow (i. e. with wakes present). For the same profile, the losses generated with wakes present were below those generated by the profile with no wakes present. The boundary layer behaviour on these very high lift pressure distributions suggested that aft loading the profiles would further reduce the profile loss. Finally, two very highly loaded and aft loaded LP turbine profile were designed and then tested in cascade. The new profiles produced losses only slightly higher than those for the <b>datum</b> <b>profile</b> with unsteady inflow, but generated 15 % greater lift...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the impact of}} aerodynamic mistuning {{in the context of}} a structurally coupled blade system. The aerodynamic mistuning assumes a difference in blade loading (between adjacent blades) but no change in eigenfrequency or modeshape. Thus, emphasis is placed on the profile shape impact of transonic rotor blades on aeroelasic damping. An example aeroelasic calculation of the proposed mistuning strategy is present for a coupled blade arrangement. The impact of mistuning compared to the tuned <b>datum</b> <b>profile</b> is discussed. It is shown that there exist significant differences for the two configurations but that the net impact of mistuning is small for the coupled system investigated compared to a freestanding blade design...|$|E

Beach profiles from top of berm or toe of armoring to MLW were standardized using NOAA-verified tide tables as a <b>datum</b> for all <b>profiles.</b> Changes in beach profile within each pair were used to evaluate armoring effects. Presumed changes due to armoring were not attributable to a single factor, but there were consistent trends. Fetch length and direction for both prevailing winds and predominant winds were compared. Fetch length, and {{the angle of the}} prevailing wind to the beach were compared singly and in groups, but no correlation was found. Comparisons of profiles taken both in spring and in late summer on a small number of beach pairs indicate opposite seasonal trends. University of Washington School of Oceanograph...|$|R

In order to research roughness of rock fracture surfaces whether to depend on scale effect, Brazil discs were fractured under tensile and compression stresses in Brazil split test with MTS (Mechanics Test Systems) and a laser profilometer was used to scan rock fracture surfaces and coordinates <b>datum</b> of central <b>profile</b> were acquired. A figure of the central profile was plotted through the coordinates datum. A certain line segment length {{is regarded as a}} step length, which is called scale and the scale length is taken to connect pairs of closer peak points on the profile curve. The directional dis-tribution of every scale’s normal vector is analyzed by statistics and normal hypothesis test. Finally, some statistics of sample degrees datum are compared with other ones and reach a conclusion that roughness of center profile curve de-pends on scale effect. The distribution of degrees more and more approximates normal distribution along with increase of scale...|$|R

On each small [...] energy surface we consider a solution of the linearized system with initial <b>datum</b> having the <b>profile</b> of an elliptic sinus: we show that solutions starting close to the corresponding phase space trajectory remain close to it for times growing exponentially with the inverse of the energy. To obtain the result we have to compute the resonant normal form of 0. 1, and we think this could be interesting in itself. 1. Introduction and statement In this paper we study small amplitude solutions of the equation 0. 1 concentrating on the periodic behaviour. Consider {{the solution of the}} linear string equation u tt Γ c 2 u xx = 0 with the initial datum: u ffl (x; 0) = fflV m sn(!xjm) u(x; 0) = 0; (1. 1) where sn is the elliptic sine [1], m, ! and Vm are constants whose values will be fixed later in t [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Interest in Mangala Valles {{remains high}} within the {{planetary}} science community. This is justified because the survey mission images {{provide us with}} nearly complete coverage of the system at high resolution. Upcoming high resolution topography from the Mars Observer Laser Altimeter will enable the application of flood discharge models with an unprecedented level of detail. Previous work on the Mangala Valles problem has relied on the available low resolution topography. This has limited the ability of workers to constrain discharge calculations to only within several-order-of-magnitude estimates. Local determinations of channel depths via shadow length measurements and photoclinometric profiling are much more accurate, but can only be applied to steep slopes (and/or low sun elevations) {{in the case of}} shadow measurements, or across relatively short distances (to avoid changes in albedo along asymmetric photoclinometric profiles). We are taking stereo parallax measurements from medium resolution Viking Orbiter images, which provide a valuable intermediate check of the topography between those measurements made thus far and the upcoming Mars Observer data. The images used are from orbits 034 A and 637 A, and cover Mangala Valles from the source graben in Memnonia Fossae {{to the beginning of the}} bifurcated reach (at 9. 5 deg lat., 151. 5 deg lon.). These images are about 300 m/pixel and 250 m/pixel, respectively. Both sets of images were orthographically projected to 250 m/pixel. The separation angle between left-right pairs is approximately 52 degrees. This results in a vertical accuracy on the order of plus or minus 260 m. Though this is still somewhat coarse, the channel relief is clearly resolved. Preliminary profiles across Mangala Valles and the large topographic ridge to the east are shown on the following page. An east-west regional tilt that resulted from slight scaling differences in the digital data has been 'removed' by visually estimating a regional datum on the stereo pairs. North-south variations in scale have not yet been adjusted for, so the zero <b>datum</b> for each <b>profile</b> was simply taken to be the high water line of the channel itself. Our depth measurement for the source breach of about 750 m agrees reasonably well with values of 700 - 1000 m determined from shadow measurements...|$|R
