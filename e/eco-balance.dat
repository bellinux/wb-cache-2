40|$|In recent years, in Italy, a large {{quantity}} of construction and demolition (C&D) waste has been generated: {{in the year}} 2004 a production of about 46, 0 Mt of C&D waste has been estimated. After a mechanical treatment, such waste can be recovered and recycled as secondary raw material, determining economic and environmental benefits, by reducing landfilling, transportation and primary resources consumption. To date, the recycling rate of C&D waste in Italy is very low-about 10 %-compared with the recycling rate of most of European countries, due to the large availability of natural resources. This study is aimed to carry out an analysis of C&D waste flow from a representative area in Italy, considering both the amount properly disposed or recycled, both the amount illegally dumped on the territory or in the containers for municipal solid waste. Furthermore, the <b>eco-balancing</b> as a particular procedure of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology, {{has been applied to}} in order to optimize C&D waste recycling and material recovered, considering the environmental impact connected to different C&D waste management schemes. Data obtained from the <b>eco-balancing</b> allow to quantify the environmental performance, to estimate the costs of each scheme considered, and finally to evaluate the best C&D waste management.

40|$|During {{the last}} several years, {{environmental}} impact assessment, regional or spatial planning, and environmental balancing seem to develop similarities, e. g. joint basic methodological approaches {{such as the use}} of environmental indicators, the focus on same environmental goods such air, water, soil, flora/fauna, etc. (Lenz 1999). Especially GIS-based software systems show their multiple applications in these fields. After a short introduction about the central role of indicators in transdisciplinary problem solving processes, experiences from a set of regional environmental (or eco) balances show a wide range of advantages as well as disadvantages in the context of the widespread use of GIS-based planning tools. Relying on concepts and examples for the spatial <b>eco-balances</b> in the district of Pfaffenhofen (Upper Bavaria, Germany; cf. Lenz 1997) and the municipality of Mulfingen (Hohenlohe, Germany) - both of them related to the concept of environmental indicators of the Advisory Board of Environmental Affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany (SRU 1994) and the Federal Environmental Agency (UBA 1995) - we can show GIS-based information systems of a high practical relevancy.

40|$|Abstract â Bats, {{the only}} flying {{mammalian}} species, {{play a vital}} role in maintaining <b>eco-balance</b> and pest-management. Bats are bio-indicators and key informers of climate change. Insectivorous bats produce echolocation calls, that vary from species to species and hence the echolocation calls can be used to identify the different bat species. Bat detectors help in recording the echolocation calls which are ultrasonic. The bat detectors convert the ultrasonic signals of bats into audio signals. This audio signal is pre-emphasized and pre-processed and then features are extracted. In this article, we propose a bat classification scheme with Dual Tree Complex Wavelet Cepstral Coefficient for bats in Kalakad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve, which lies in the Southern Western Ghats, South India, declared as the World Heritage Centre by UNESCO. On classifying the bats calls with k-NN, Bayes and SVM classifiers, SVM was found to outperform others...|$|E

In particular, {{it is part of the}} concept to investigate if the shape of plants can be manipulated to let them grow into the shape of the final product as far as possible. Thus, it is assumed to not only create more eco-friendly products for a better <b>eco-balance</b> of the material, but additionally it would be possible to have less manufacturing steps.

30|$|Textile dyeing {{industry}} at present uses excessive amount of synthetic dyes {{to meet the}} required coloration of global consumption of textiles due to cheaper prices, wider ranges of bright shades, and considerably improved fastness properties in comparison to natural dyes (El-Nagar et al. 2005; Iqbal et al. 2008). But the production of synthetic dyes is dependent on petrochemical source, {{and some of these}} dyes contain carcinogenic amines (Hunger 2003). The application of such dyes causes serious health hazards and influences negatively the <b>eco-balance</b> of nature (Bruna and Maria 2013; Goodarzian and Ekrami 2010; Jothi 2008). Moreover, many countries already imposed stringent environment standards over these dyes. For instance, Germany has banned the azo dyes (Almahy et al. 2013). In this situation, a higher demand is put towards the greener alternatives or agricultural residues (Ammayappan et al. 2014). As a result, natural dyes are among the promising options for developing a greener textile dyeing process and such interest is reflected to the increased number of recent publications. Plant leaves are potential sources of natural dyes because of their easy availability and abundant nature.|$|E

Sand mining has led to the danger of river-course change and causing floods. This replacement has been found to improve the strength characteristics of ferrocement and also makes it lightweight. This not only helps in construction of multi storied structures but also found to maintain thermal comfort. The main investigation is regarding the percentage replacement of sand by BFS and reinforcing with meshes. It is observed that the ultimate strength reaches a peak value and later decreases due to replacement of BFS. Marginal decrease in ultimate strength with increase in mesh content has also been observed. Further, with the cracks developed parallel to the mesh layers, the weak planes are generated along the mesh layer which has hastened the failure. The experimental results are analysed and a theoretical solution has been developed for the computation of stress corresponding to strain...|$|E

30|$|One {{major goal}} is to fully exploit the {{potential}} of natural materials and shapes for applications in consumer or investment goods. Products are to be identified, where the change from conventional materials like plastics or metal to a renewable material is reasonable. In parallel, new ways to utilise plants as technical materials are identified. The shape of the final product is approximated {{as far as possible}} already during plant growth. By using natural materials, a better <b>eco-balance</b> is expected. In addition, such an approach will significantly reduce manufacturing steps. As a consequence resources could be saved during production. Furthermore, it is expected that plants which are being influenced during their growth will go through a natural topology optimisation. Grown structures can lead to mechanically more stable products, compared to plants or parts of plants being shaped under, e.g. pressure and heat after they have been harvested [18]. Because the approach is inherently interdisciplinary, a new type of construction with natural materials and an integrated concept of construction and environmental assessment is strived for, which can be seen as an innovative approach. Accordingly, in order to test the feasibility of this approach from a technical as well as an ecological perspective, appropriate studies cannot only be carried out by one discipline, but only through the already mentioned close interdisciplinary cooperation.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{majority}} of polyurethanes are crosslinked thermoset polymers, which cannot be recycled by melting and extrusion processes without excessive degradation. Sev-eral recycling techniques for polyurethanes {{have been described}} in technical and scientific literature and are used industrially, such as rebonding of flexible foam, regrind and hot stamping of Reinforced Reaction Injection Molding (RRIM) and glycolysis of rigid foams. Several chemical recycling methods for polyurethanes have been developed and pa-tented, such as hydrolysis, glycolysis, aminolysis and acidolysis. The glycolysis process is also being used on an industrial scale for recycling of "in house " production waste of rigid and microcellular shoe sole, polyurethane foam. This article describes a novel, new, chemical recycling process that has been developed to produce relatively high performance polyols from the recycling of a diversity of polyurethanes. This process is attractive for use on an industrial scale {{and appears to be}} commercially viable, based on cost-performance, particularly {{in the context of the}} total <b>eco-balance</b> of polyurethanes.

An empirical model was created for carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide for both uplands and paddy rice using monitoring data from 22 fields. The greenhouse gas emissions were converted into GWP, whereas yield and FSN were obtained from farmers' interviews and literature survey. Land use distribution was obtained by ground surveys in 2002, 2005 and 2007. The analysis showed that paddy rice and soybean were characterized by a high GWP, low FSN and high income, whereas onions and vegetables had a high FSN but low GWP and moderate income. Wheat showed a negative GWP in some years and abandoned areas always exhibit negative values. The total GWP for the region was 14184, 11085 and 8337 Mg CO 2 yr^[- 1] for 2002, 2005 and 2007, respectively. The contribution of paddy rice to GWP was highest, ranging from 40 % to 75 %. To find optimal land use combinations that have higher income and lower GWP and FSN than present, all possible land use combination was analyzed by changing the land use proportion from 0 - 100 % at an interval of 10 %. The number of land use combinations meeting the requirements in the three investigated years was 205.

The purpose is 1) to define âregenerative designâ and âregenerative developmentâ and clarify {{the distinction between}} them, 2) to propose an overall framework that offers {{a new understanding of}} success with both quantitative and qualitative patterns, and 3) to evaluate the emerging regenerative design support toolsâ REGEN, <b>Eco-Balance,</b> Perkins+Will Framework, Living Building Challenge, and LENSES. Regenerative design is an approach to shape and form a system that seeks to reverse environmental degradation by creating positive impacts, rather than merely causing less damage, to increase the health and wellbeing of humans, other living beings, and ecosystems as a co-evolutionary whole. Moreover, regenerative development is an approach for enabling human communities to co-evolve with natural living systems and building the field of caring for ongoing stewardship and self-renewing. Regenerative design and development, together, implies that these two approaches are interrelated and need to be discussed together. The proposed framework, Holistic Regenerative Design Framework, is an effort to visually represent the key attributes and principles of regenerative design and development. The framework has four Essences: Philosophy, Design Process, Indicators, and Emergence of Regeneration. Each Essence includes four main categories to identify the focal points. The Holistic Regenerative Design Framework can be used in design processes and evaluation of tools or case studies. This thesis aims to use the Framework to evaluate the regenerative design support tools listed above.

40|$|Both the {{scientific}} and negotiating community has recognized Bangladesh {{as one of the}} most vulnerable countries to Climate Change effect which in future is likely to face more frequent climatic adversities. This paper emphasizes on putting the theme of âEducation in Emergencyâ in all climate change adaptation efforts in the country which can enable it to safeguard countryâs important education sector during any disaster or in the recovery phase. Education has received inconsiderable amount of importance in those efforts and ultimately encompassed all the spheres of social, emotional, cognitive and physical ground which decelerate multifarious predicaments and adversities. In preparing this paper the authors highly rely on secondary sources of data. In the era of globalization, a vast number of populations remain untouched or being detracted from the light of education. It is particularly fact for country like Bangladesh where natural calamity is an incessant event due to the intrusion of globalization. Bilateral, multilateral, regional and global affiliation and association can be undertaken to the depletion of hindrances. Besides, substantial and congruous strategies, plans, policies and programs within the internal infrastructure may assist to mitigate this endanger and also comply with the commitment of education for all even in the cataclysm. For accomplishing responsiveness and flourishing prowess, an integrating approach to the management of Education in Emergency (EiE) requires coordination and collaboration among government departments or ministries and agencies, designing and upgrading courses (including issues like Need for Sustainable Development and Actions for Environment Protection, Environmental Management Tools & Environmental Assessment, Environment Pollution Management, Progress in Environmental Science, International Environment Laws etc.), as well as superior and immaculate information technology to resolve this consternation and vulnerability. Propitious and admissible approaches can ensure <b>eco-balance</b> and sustainable socio-economic development in a vulnerable country like Bangladesh with a proper accentuation on education in emergency.

The very essence of above quotation has an inseparable relation with the research and therefore the study does fix its primary and principal aim to acquire knowledge and enquire about architectural activism on built activities carried out at tourism destinations in Coxâs Bazar. The central focus sheds light on Coxâs Bazar (a national tourism heaven and a projected regional hub for tourist activities covering entire region of Bangladesh, part of India, part of Myanmar (Burma) and Southern provinces of China) with specific focus on three selected case studies sites of Belize, Langkawi Island, Malaysia & Greek Islands Mykonos and Santorini. Coxâs Bazar is the projected case study for this research aimed to enquire the role of architectural presence (or absence) endorsed or ignored while built activities were carried out and questionnaires, interviews have been conducted. The study therefore represents the area where Coxâsâ Bazar missed its chance to explore full potential and how the dilemma could be removed by implementing a coherent architectural activism where the full potential of the site would be possible to realise. In this connection, the current study aims to focus on built environment where they are demanded for tourism expansion and economic activities particularly in remote and fragile environments where it is vital that impacts be kept to a minimum. This study enquires how coherent architectural activism can address the issue of sustainable accommodation without compromising nature preservation and <b>eco-balance.</b> The study therefore also includes but is not limited to understanding the socio-cultural, economic and environmental impacts of tourism development on the residents in Coxâs Bazar Township.

Ancient towns and villages in Southern Italy are a meaningful example of ecological design in which built technologies were strongly oriented by the site and by the availability of natural resources. They intermediate the relationship between natural and built environment and supply dwelling performances coherently with local context. Harmonization of nature and architecture in many historic towns shows this positive integration and represents an important topic in terms of urban management and urban planning. Ancient villages, especially, present urban patters deeply linked to topography and to the natural environment thus also urban signatures are designed in such a way to give environmental benefits to the whole built-up area in terms of improving microclimate, managing rain fall water and controlling environmental risk. Moreover urban signatures are featured by a common constructive approach aimed at a sustainable use of local resources, as some sort of ???instinctive care??? to Life Cycle of building materials. This kind of implicit sustainability of urban space is now treated by the impact of modern transformation of historic assets - even by the aim of rehabilitation or maintenance - in which the misunderstanding of primary, sustainable building processes could upset local ecological balance and site identity. The common and acceptable instance of updating services and performances of historic urban space by modern dwelling functions ??? such as accessibility by car, improving infrastructure and nets, developing commerce, etc. - ought to be compared to the original state of the site and ought be adequate to local, specific carrying capacity. According to these remarks, {{the purpose of the study}} is to propose a methodology for ???scanning??? city space in a way of emphasizing the coherence between the urban pattern, urban signatures and some key constructive elements. Three key assumptions drive the study. First assumption is the ante litteram sustainability of ancient town, tangible evidence of building tradition devised by economic opportunity and by environment understanding, a special condition that drove constructive solutions towards forms and functions adequate to local carrying capacity According to this, the second assumption regards the application of LCA to the urban signatures. The study aims at recognizing the original life cycle design approach aimed at preserving natural resources, reducing transport costs and optimizing the life service of each element. Third and last assumption concerns the qualitative approach to LCA. It is targeted on a sort of <b>eco-balance</b> more than an inventory itself, focusing on pre-industrial constructive process and local design strategy. From this side, attention will be given at some environmental parameters such as the use of natural resources (local and global), the life cycle management (urban and natural), the re-use and re-cycling of materials that could act as constrains in rehabilitation or management projects...|$|E
30|$|The {{usage of}} the {{synthetic}} dyes in textile dyeing industries is increasing due to cheaper and wider ranges of brighter shades in comparison to natural dyes. Coloured products have gained lot of importance in present day societies. Textile dyes are considered as the most polluting industrial process. Increase in the demand of the dyed textile products with proportional increase in its manufacturing by utilizing synthetic dyes {{has contributed to the}} severe pollution of water, soil and as a whole to our environment (Dos et al. 2007). The effluent containing heavy load of harmful chemicals of the textile industries {{is one of the major}} polluters of our environment (Gyanendra et al. 2015) Excessive use of the synthetic dyes in textiles has led serious health hazards and disturbances in <b>eco-balance</b> of nature. Estimated consumption of the textiles globally is around 30 million tonnes for which the expected increase is at the rate of about 3 Â % per annum (Rajendran and Thamarai 2014). About 700, 000 tonnes of different dyes are required for the colouration of such a bulk quantity of the textiles (Rungruangkitkrai and Mongkholrattanasit 2012). The global production of the synthetic dyes is over 7 [*]Ã[*] 105 annually (Ogugbue and Sawidis 2011). The adverse of the synthetic dyes can be prevented by utilizing eco-friendly dyes and methods (Wanyama et al. 2014). Natural dyes exhibit long endurance, beauty and charm and can be of varied sources like mineral, insect animal and plant of which roots, flowers, barks, leaves, fruits and stems can be used. The international rising demand of the natural dyes is about 10, 000 tonnes which is mere 1 Â % of the world synthetic dye consumption (Sachan and Kapoor 2007). It is of relevance to optimize the colouring process with the objective of reducing the environmental impact of the textile dye industry. The associated toxicity, carcinogenicity and allergic reactions of the synthetic dyes has raised an interest in the revival of the natural dyes which are clinically safer, disease free, non-polluting and biodegradable (Kulkari et al. 2011; Aminoddin 2010, 2010). Non-substantivity of the natural fibre towards natural dye requires a mordant which are usually derived from metallic salts like alum, chrome, copper sulphate, stannous chloride and ferrous sulphate which does not make the process of the dyeing fully eco-friendly (Lodrick et al. 2015). The increased awareness on hazardous, toxic and allergic reactions associated with synthetic dyes has raised a growing demand for the natural dyes and dyed products (Singh and Srivastava 2015). The rising demand of the dyed products and consciousness about the human health and pollution has marked a need for the revival and {{usage of the}} natural dyes and dyed products all over the world. Kashmir valley abounds a rich and varied biodiversity of plants which needs to get explored and utilized commercially as a varied sources of the dyes and mordants. India is one of the 17 megadiverse countries having a rich biodiversity and wide range of natural products (Singh and Srivastava 2015). A sustainable linkage must be developed between cultivation, collection and use of the natural dye sources in our country which has a rich biodiversity and plenty of raw materials (Kumaresan et al. 2011). Kashmir valley enriches with natural dye sources, which has to be explored. The dyeing potential of the similar species using different mordant is only reported by Geelani et al. (2015 a, b). The work was conducted to explore the dyeing potential of Quercus robur, Salix alba and Populus deltoides for their usage in textile industries in order to reduce the pollution of the synthetic dyes. The aim of the work was to extract the natural sources of the textile dyes and mordants by adopting eco-friendly practices. The specific objectives were to compare the efficiency of the dye with the suitable mordant on the fabrics in producing different shades and hues, analysing the colour values and assessment of the colour fastness properties of the dyed fabrics.|$|E

Water {{is a vital}} {{resource}} for every living thing on the Earth. The definition by Scientific Hydrological Committee of the US Federal Council for Science and Technology in 1962 is as follows:âHydrology is a basic and an applied science that treats {{the waters of the}} Earth, their occurrence, circulation, and distribution, their chemical and physical properties, and their reaction with their environment, including their relation to living thingsâ. Thanks to this definition, hydrology has become a subject matter studies by many other scientific disciplines. Hydrology has a interdisciplinary nature and is in close relation to such sciences as mathematics, physical, and chemistry. Global warming caused serious problems concerning water resources, which is thought to result in a decrease in agricultural and forestry products, energy shortage, a populations flow from coastal to central areas. Â  For the preservation of <b>eco-balance</b> and a sustainable development of human communities, water resources should be exploited in the wisest way possible so as to satisfy the present and future need for water. Recently, due to the increasing importance of water, efficient use of water resources has been drawing more attention in Turkish academic milieu. It is crucial to monitor the fluctuations in the water levels in agricultural countries like Turkey. These variations are monitored via satellites and used as data in numerous studies. Comparing satellite data with hydrometeorologically obtained data increases the reliability the processed data. The present study analyses the variations in nine grid levels in Turkey relying on data obtained from GRACE (Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment), which was launched in March 2002. The satellite is intended to determine the static gravity field of the Earth and its temporal changes. With this satellite, variations in the terrestrial water storage, tidal and atmospheric mass, and glacial mass can be monitored by means of temporal changes in the globeâs gravitational force. The measurement of earthâs gravitational force and its temporal variations and the determination of their interrelation to climatic changes are among the missions of GRACE. Â  GRACE mission consists of two identical satellites orbiting about 220 Â± 50 km apart in a circular trajectory 460 km above the Earth at inclination of 89 Âº to the equator. Intersatellite distances which are recalculated every 5 seconds and variations in these distances allow the researchers to monitor temporal mass variations. Â  By means of the energy conservation principle, the difference between gravitational forces of the two satellites on the orbit can be measured {{on the basis of the}} evaluation of the variations in intersatellite distance, the satellitesâ positions and velocity and accelerometric data. Â  Two types of data are obtained from the satellites; i. e. monthly L 2 harmonic gravity field model and L 1 satellite on-orbit data. L 1 B data refers to a sub-set of GRACE data used for the calculation of spherical harmonic coefficient, called L 2 data. The present study primarily focuses on Southeastern Anatolia (in Turkey), where numerous dams were constructed within the framework of GAP (Southeasten Anatolia Project), on which there is little but hard-to-process data, and which neighbours transborder rivers. Â  To create a highly representative data set, the study relies on monthly data on total precipitation, evaporation, snow water equivalent from meteorology stations within the grid and monthly average flow estimates from flow observation stations. Measurements and evaluations were performed from March 2003 till May 2008. Â  Whether a statistically continuous variation (increase-decrease) occurs in the value of a random variable in a time series (trend) can be revealed via statistical tests. The Mann-Kendall is one of the common trend test, a non-parametric test. Â  Mann-Kendall is often times used to analyze and describe such hydrometeorological data as precipitation, temperature, evaporation, and flow. If the data from an observation station continuously increase or decrease over time, then it can be suggested that there is a pattern, i. e. trend. Â  Regression analysis is used to estimate whether a statistically significant relationship exists among variables in the system. If so, it is used to obtain the regression equation of this relationship, to produce estimations, and to calculate reliability range of these estimations. Â  The level variations in each grid, meteorological data and average current data were analyzed via Mann-Kendall trend analysis and regression analysis to discover probable increases and decreases in these variables over time. Â  In conclusion, out of nine grids the analyses of L 1 B and L 2 resolution data revealed a significant (pYÃ¼ksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
