500|$|In October 2006 Thistlethwayte {{described}} his jazz and R background to MusicFix and the band's sound as [...] "rock Sinatra" [...] where [...] "he outlook, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> <b>is</b> {{about being a}} young person in today's society ... being an Australian in an American-ised, Britain-ised kind of world, where you're trying to stay true to yourself". Baker added [...] "We contrived to make it not contrived ... Rai was all for originality in his own vision and so were we".|$|E
2500|$|Even {{though the}} group's name {{includes}} Finland's capital Helsinki, they first played {{there at the}} Flow Festival in August 2007: [...] "When we were in Norway {{at the end of}} last year there were a few Finnish interviewers who came to interview us mainly about the name. I think they were quite perplexed. To us, the name means having to answer many questions and inquiries about the name, which <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> <b>is</b> entirely understandable." [...] Sam Perry said.|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} categorisation, Isis have been {{described}} as post-rock, a genre which leans away from the traditional elements of choruses, verses, repetitive vocals, or fast riffing – what Turner describes as [...] "guitar theatrics." [...] However, post-rock has what is essentially a [...] sound: one devoid of aggressive vocals and distorted guitars. Isis, however, have hardcore/sludge origins (especially in their pre-Celestial era) and hardcore-like vocals. Their music includes elements of hardcore, drone, sludge, ambient music, and post-rock; yet none of these labels defines their sound fully. Critic Dan Epstein notes that [...] "though [...] originally lumped in with the hardcore and doom-metal scenes, the band has long since transcended the musical boundaries of those genres". However, their ongoing acceptance within the pantheon of hardcore music is attested to by Converge's Jacob Bannon, who has gone on record saying that [...] "if I wanna listen to emotional music which <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> contemporary [...] I'll listen to Isis or something like that – something that is [...] emotional, powerful music." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bickers and Chadwick seemed {{confident}} that age, perspective and situation {{meant that they}} could avoid the problems which had divided the band in 1990. Interviewed {{at the time of}} the release of Days Run Away, Chadwick admitted acceptance of the fact that [...] "we're really different people. It's a very complex kind of friendship, and I think it'll always be slightly fractious. We don't have this huge buddy thing going on though at the same time it's very intimate... We've always had a very instinctive way of communicating with each other, which <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> why we make good music together." [...] Bickers in turn reflected [...] "I think we're both old enough and ugly enough to address any issues head-on and keep our tempers in check. We're also doing things at our own pace rather than letting a record company dictate what we do, which helps... It's still early days but communication is good and so is the music. This is about letting bygones be bygones and just getting on with it. Personally, I've never been happier." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, with {{a little}} {{forceful}} gesture, [...] "there are parts of my record I can't boast about, but there are points on which you'd go 'way beyond me.

50|$|As a child Wendy St. Kitts {{spent her}} summers in New York City where she {{eventually}} relocated {{and struggled to}} build her music career. Man, it was as tough as it should be. Selling sex was and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> the thing to do, but that's just not me. So, like many others, I took the long, hard road of certified rejection and truly discovered who I was. Still the best thing I've ever done.|$|E

5000|$|Jonathan Levine {{has said}} that the movie is semi-autobiographical: [...] "'I wish I could say that I sold pot and I had a shrink like Ben Kingsley, but no, it wasn't like that,' admits Jonathan Levine.

'The Stephanie character, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> <b>is</b> a composite of a few different ladies who broke up with me,' Levine says with a laugh. 'That happened.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|Creep's solo {{recordings}} {{have been}} a mesh of outlaw country to folk to industrial. The three solo albums {{that have come out}} have volume numbers (Volume 13: Folk Songs for the Dead, Volume 4: The Untimely Death of Spade 13, Volume 9: Flowers for Nikki) indicate that there are more albums to come. In a radio interview on the Independent Corner, Creep said [...] "For my solo work, there are 15 volumes that are ready to go, its just when i get around to them <b>i</b> <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> when we will hear them." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{record is}} a homage to her {{favourite}} {{songs of the}} 80's. Every song has been reinvented to mould the Kate Ceberano style. Ceberano said of the album, [...] "I grew up on Lime Avenue and spent all my teenage years through the 80's listening to different music and firing up my lust {{for a career in}} music. I'm so nostalgic about that period of my life and in many ways wished we still had that house… this album <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> a collection of different songs connected to different memories from that time" ...|$|E
5000|$|Years ago, I {{looked at}} people and I {{was so full}} of some sort of emotion and I'd say, 'Absolutely not!' ... But I have to admit, people have asked me more recently, and even though I have no idea how such a series of events would come to pass, I can tell that there isn't the bombast in my voice, in the denial, in the refusal. It's more like, 'Well, I dunno.' Never say never is <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>is</b> what people tell you. In this life, all kinds of strange things come to pass. Realizing that it doesn't really kick up a big {{firestorm}} of emotion, it kind of suggests that at least if someone started talking I'd sit still long enough to listen.|$|E

5000|$|Shock Till You Drop {{criticized the}} film for its poor acting and plot, but also remarked {{that it also}} [...] "functions {{primarily}} {{as an attempt to}} keep the carnival-scumbag vibe of vintage H.G. Lewis, David Friedman and Doris Wishman alive and well" [...] and that appreciated these aspects of Death-Scourt Service. HorrorNews.net wrote a mostly favorable review for the movie, stating [...] "At the end of the day, there's absolutely nothing about Death-Scort Service that's subtle; it hits you repeatedly about the head and neck until the final credits roll. Sometimes it's with nudity, sometimes it's with violence. Occasionally, you get both. Again, that's definitely not a complaint. I found myself enjoying the flick even when I felt dirty, which, <b>I</b> <b>guess,</b> <b>is</b> a compliment. Donohue and company know their audience is filled with filthy freaks, and they're more than happy to supply our demand." ...|$|E
