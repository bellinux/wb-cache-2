5|$|Advanced {{methods of}} loading were not {{foreseen}} when the ships were designed. While the new processes are more efficient, loading {{is more difficult}} to control (<b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> over an hour just to halt the operation), occasionally resulting in overloading the ship. These unexpected shocks, over time, can damage the hull's structural integrity.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of mendelevium is mostly known only in solution, in which <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> on the +3 or +2 oxidation states. The +1 state {{has also been}} reported, but {{has not yet been}} confirmed.|$|E
5|$|A highsider, highside, or {{high side}} {{is a type of}} bike motion which is caused by a rear wheel gaining {{traction}} when it is not facing in the direction of travel, usually after slipping sideways in a curve. This can occur under heavy braking, acceleration, a varying road surface, or suspension activation, especially due to interaction with the drive train. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> the form of a single slip-then-flip or a series of violent oscillations.|$|E

5|$|In {{eukaryotic}} somatic cells, the poly(A) tail of most mRNAs in the cytoplasm gradually get shorter, and mRNAs with shorter poly(A) tail are translated {{less and}} degraded sooner. However, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> many hours before an mRNA is degraded. This deadenylation and degradation {{process can be}} accelerated by microRNAs complementary to the 3' untranslated region of an mRNA. In immature egg cells, mRNAs with shortened poly(A) tails are not degraded, but are instead stored without being translated. They are then activated by cytoplasmic polyadenylation after fertilisation, during egg activation.|$|E
5|$|Tests on the thorium uptake {{of workers}} {{involved}} in monazite processing showed thorium levels above recommended limits in their bodies, but no {{adverse effects on}} health were found at those moderately low concentrations. No chemical toxicity has yet been observed in the tracheobronchial tract and the lungs from exposure to thorium. People who work with thorium compounds are at a risk of dermatitis. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> as much as thirty years after the ingestion of thorium for symptoms to manifest themselves.|$|E
5|$|The Display Data Channel (DDC) is a {{communication}} channel {{based on the}} I²C bus specification. HDMI specifically requires the device implement the Enhanced Display Data Channel (E-DDC), which {{is used by the}} HDMI source device to read the E-EDID data from the HDMI sink device to learn what audio/video formats <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>take.</b> HDMI requires that the E-DDC implement I²C standard mode speed (100kbit/s) and allows it to optionally implement fast mode speed (400kbit/s).|$|E

5|$|The SIII has an 8-megapixel camera {{similar to}} that of the Galaxy SII. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> 3264×2448-pixel {{resolution}} photos and record videos in 1920×1080-pixel (1080p) resolution. Samsung improved the camera's software over that of its predecessor to include zero shutter lag, and Burst Mode and Best Shot, which work together to quickly take numerous photos before the best-judged frame is selected. The phone can also take pictures while recording videos. The rear-facing camera is complemented by a 1.9-megapixel front-facing camera that can record 720p videos. The phone has LED flash and autofocus.|$|E
5|$|Albatross chicks take a {{long time}} to fledge. In the case of the great albatrosses, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> up to 280 days; even for the smaller albatrosses, it takes {{anywhere}} between 140 and 170 days. Like many seabirds, albatross chicks will gain enough weight to be heavier than their parents, and prior to fledging they use these reserves to build up body condition (particularly growing all their flight feathers), usually fledging at the same weight as their parents. Between 15% and 65% of those fledged survive to breed. Albatross chicks fledge on their own and receive no further help from their parents, who return to the nest after fledging, unaware their chick has left. Studies of juveniles dispersing at sea have suggested an innate migration behaviour, a genetically coded navigation route, which helps young birds when they are first out at sea.|$|E
5|$|For many {{practical}} purposes, {{light and}} other electromagnetic waves will appear to propagate instantaneously, but for long distances and very sensitive measurements, their finite speed has noticeable effects. In communicating with distant space probes, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> minutes to {{hours for a}} message to get from Earth to the spacecraft, or vice versa. The light seen from stars left them many years ago, allowing {{the study of the}} history of the universe by looking at distant objects. The finite speed of light also limits the theoretical maximum speed of computers, since information must be sent within the computer from chip to chip. The speed of light can be used with time of flight measurements to measure large distances to high precision.|$|E

5|$|Midazolam, marketed {{under the}} trade name Versed, among others, is a {{medication}} used for anesthesia, procedural sedation, trouble sleeping, and severe agitation. It works by inducing sleepiness, decreasing anxiety, and causing {{a loss of}} ability to create new memories. It is also useful {{for the treatment of}} seizures. Midazolam can be given by mouth, intravenously, by injection into a muscle, sprayed into the nose, or in the cheek. When given intravenously, it typically begins working within five minutes; when injected into a muscle, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> fifteen minutes to begin working. Effects last for between one and six hours.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of nobelium is incompletely characterized {{and is known}} only in aqueous solution, in which <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> on the +3 or +2 oxidation states, the latter being more stable. It was largely expected before the discovery of nobelium that in solution, it would behave like the other actinides, with the trivalent state being predominant; however, Seaborg predicted in 1949 that the +2 state would also be relatively stable for nobelium, as the No2+ ion would have the ground-state electron configuration 5f14, including the stable filled 5f14 shell. It took nineteen years before this prediction was confirmed.|$|E
5|$|The {{consequence}} of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read can be challenging in English. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages, including Italian, Spanish, or German. Nonetheless, there is an advantage for learners of English reading in learning the specific sound-symbol regularities {{that occur in the}} standard English spellings of commonly used words. Such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in English. Making primary school teachers more aware of the primacy of morpheme representation in English may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write English.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} {{naturally}} occurring isotope of hydrogen, known as protium, {{has a single}} proton and no neutrons. In ionic compounds, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> on either a positive charge, becoming a cation composed of a bare proton, or a negative charge, becoming an anion known as a hydride. Hydrogen can form compounds with most elements and is present in water and most organic compounds. It plays a particularly important role in acid-base chemistry, in which many reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. As the only neutral atom for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically, study of the energetics and spectrum of the hydrogen atom has {{played a key role}} in the development of quantum mechanics.|$|E
5|$|The {{teeth of}} V.salvadorii do not {{resemble}} those of other monitor species, which are typically blunt, peglike, and face slightly rearward. Their upper teeth are long and fang-like, standing vertical from the jawbone, designed to hook into fast-moving or feathered prey such as birds, bats, and rodents. Their lower teeth are housed in a fleshy sheath. In the wild, V. salvadorii is the top predator in New Guinea, feeding on birds, eggs, small mammals, and carrion. Natives have reported that <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> down pigs, deer, and hunting dogs, and hauls its prey into the canopy to consume it. Captive specimens {{have been known to}} eat fish, frogs, rodents, chickens, and dog food.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} area {{residents}} initiated {{an effort to}} have the former West Michigan Pike designated {{what is now called}} a Pure Michigan Byway. The designation would prioritize the area for historic preservation grants. A Preserve America grant funded a survey from June 2007 through September 2010, the results of which were a set of reports through the Michigan State Historic Preservation Office on the historical nature of the West Michigan Pike. In 2011, the group {{was in the process of}} securing resolutions from municipalities along the highway in support of the designation. According to officials working on the byway, <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> up to seven years to complete the process. The initial proposals had the byway continuing to Mackinaw City, but as approved in 2016, it runs from New Buffalo on I-94 to Ludington, following US31 except between business loops at South Haven, Muskegon, Whitehall–Montague and Pentwater.|$|E

5|$|Goalkeepers {{should be}} wary of dummying, lob shots and skip or bounce shots. Dummying is where players fake shots, leading keepers {{to come out of}} the water too early. This can cause the goalkeeper to come up too early and have to go back down for energy. The lob shot is where a field player {{attempts}} to put the ball over where the goalkeeper's hands can reach. This usually happens either if the goalkeeper is out of position from the dummies or if they are too far out from the goal. The goalkeeper should swim back to try to block it, as it is nowhere near as fast as the power shot. The bounce or skip shot is where a player propels the ball at the water with enough force to make it bounce or skim along the water. <b>It</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> the goalkeeper by surprise as they cannot predict the direction the ball will go.|$|E
5|$|Since <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> {{decades of}} {{studying}} {{climate change and}} tracking bee colonies to find correlations between them, many researchers have turned to ecological modeling. In a Brazilian study, researchers investigated the impact that climate change will have on ten endemic bee species in various future climatic scenarios. It is known that moderate temperatures and high relative humidity impacts flight activity and foraging behavior in bee species such as Melipona and Centris. As a result, the scientists predict that in scenarios where temperatures continue to increase and humidity continues to decrease the only suitable climates for bees in Brazil {{will be in the}} more mountainous environments. The most optimistic scenario estimated climate change would still lead to a five percent reduction in these species’ populations. While this may not seem like a large change, bees are very sensitive to the effects of small population size; small populations can lead to reduced genetic variability and decreased fitness. As a result of this sensitivity, fragmented habitat are less likely to support a viable population and may lead to additional colony collapse.|$|E
5|$|The {{scope of}} ecology {{contains}} {{a wide array}} of interacting levels of organization spanning micro-level (e.g., cells) to a planetary scale (e.g., biosphere) phenomena. Ecosystems, for example, contain abiotic resources and interacting life forms (i.e., individual organisms that aggregate into populations which aggregate into distinct ecological communities). Ecosystems are dynamic, they do not always follow a linear successional path, but they are always changing, sometimes rapidly and sometimes so slowly that <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>take</b> thousands of years for ecological processes to bring about certain successional stages of a forest. An ecosystem's area can vary greatly, from tiny to vast. A single tree is of little consequence to the classification of a forest ecosystem, but critically relevant to organisms living in and on it. Several generations of an aphid population can exist over the lifespan of a single leaf. Each of those aphids, in turn, support diverse bacterial communities. The nature of connections in ecological communities cannot be explained by knowing the details of each species in isolation, because the emergent pattern is neither revealed nor predicted until the ecosystem is studied as an integrated whole. Some ecological principles, however, do exhibit collective properties where the sum of the components explain the properties of the whole, such as birth rates of a population being equal to the sum of individual births over a designated time frame.|$|E
