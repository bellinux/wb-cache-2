40|$|Objective To {{examine the}} intra-rater, inter-rater, and inter-instrumental {{reliability}} of the <b>digitalized</b> pinch muscle strength dynamometer. Method Th irty normal subjects were examined for pinch strength, using both the Preston pinch gauge and the <b>digitalized</b> pinch dynamometer. The participants performed all pinch strength tests in the seated position as recommended by the American Society of Hand Th erapists (ASHT). Th ree successive measurements were taken for each hand. Th e mean of the three trials was used for data analysis. Th e pinch strength tests performed used a repeated measure design and measurements were taken by each rater. Results The relationship between the Preston pinch gauge and the <b>digitalized</b> pinch dynamometer in pinch strength was reliable (the ICC were 0. 821 and 0. 785 in rater 1 and rater 2 respectively). Th e relationship between the fi rst session and second session in pinch strength using the <b>digitalized</b> pinch dynamometer was reliable (the ICC were 0. 872 and 0. 886 in rater A and rater B respectively). Th e relationship between rater A and rater B in pinch strength using the <b>digitalized</b> pinch dynamometer was reliable (the ICC was 0. 754). Conclusion The pinch strength measurement using the <b>digitalized</b> pinch dynamometer is reliable within the rater and between raters. Th us, the Preston pinch gauge and the <b>digitalized</b> dynamometer measure grip strength equivalently, {{and can be used}} interchangeably...|$|R

40|$|The {{digitalization}} {{of products}} {{has become an}} important driver for service innovation in manufacturing firms. The embedding of digital technology in previously non-digital products creates <b>digitalized</b> product platforms that enable digital service innovation. Digital service innovation offers new business opportunities for manufacturing industries, as well as challenges established premises for value creation.  While digital service innovation {{can be found in}} many manufacturing industries, this thesis studies service logic in <b>digitalized</b> product platforms in the vehicle industry. Existing Information Systems (IS) literature presents challenges in digital service innovation relating to value, architecture, and generativity. The design of the architecture of <b>digitalized</b> product platforms requires the identification and combination of digital and non-digital assets. Understanding the architectural aspects is useful in digital service innovation. Moreover, with growing instances of generative digital technologies, it is challenging to develop strategies to leverage generativity for service design in <b>digitalized</b> product platforms. While digital technologies are embedded in products, the role of technology-embeddedness in value creation of digital services is relatively unexplored. Drawing on these challenges, this thesis describes and conceptualizes the underlying premises brought by the architecture and generativity to the value creation of services in <b>digitalized</b> product platforms. The research question addressed in this thesis is: What are the underlying premises for services in <b>digitalized</b> product platforms? To address the question, an interpretive qualitative research approach was adopted in a collaborative research project concerning services enabled by digitalization of vehicles. Drawing on digital innovation and service literature, this thesis presents a theoretical perspective {{on the role of the}} architecture and generativity of <b>digitalized</b> product platforms for value creation of digital services. This perspective is conceptualized as underlying premises for this specific class of services. The premises frame the service logic in <b>digitalized</b> product platforms and provide a ground for understanding services in <b>digitalized</b> product platforms in relation to value dimensions, architecture and generativity. The premises are based on five concepts: value-in-architecture, value-in-connectivity, fundamental asset for value creation, mutual dependence of modular and layered modular assets, and re-evaluation of value propositions. The proposed premises offer a basis for understanding value creation of this class of services, and guidance for manufacturing firms designing <b>digitalized</b> product platforms...|$|R
