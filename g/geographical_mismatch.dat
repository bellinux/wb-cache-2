40|$|Understanding how {{climate change}} can affect crop-pollinator systems helps predict {{potential}} <b>geographical</b> <b>mismatches</b> between a crop and its pollinators, and therefore identify areas vulnerable to loss of pollination services. We examined {{the distribution of}} orchard species (apples, pears, plums and other top fruits) and their pollinators in Great Britain, for present and future climatic conditions projected for 2050 under the SRES A 1 B Emissions Scenario. We used a relative index of pollinator availability {{as a proxy for}} pollination service. At present there is a large spatial overlap between orchards and their pollinators, but predictions for 2050 revealed that the most suitable areas for orchards corresponded to low pollinator availability. However, we found that pollinator availability may persist in areas currently used for fruit production, but which are predicted to provide sub-optimal environmental suitability for orchard species in the future. Our results may be used to identify mitigation options to safeguard orchard production against the risk of pollination failure in Great Britain over the next 50 years; for instance choosing fruit tree varieties that are adapted to future climatic conditions, or boosting wild pollinators through improving landscape resources. Our approach can be readily applied to other regions and crop systems, and expanded to include different climatic scenarios...|$|R

Four classes of housing policy are considered: Rent controls, tenant protection, rationing of housing, and fostering of social housing. Based on a thorough analysis {{of federal and}} regional legislation, for each class, an index is constructed, increasing in degree of regulation. The average of class-specific indices make up a composite index. The index reflects dramatic increases in regulations during and immediately after the World Wars. Likewise, the 2010 s are characterized by a surge in virtually all classes of regulations in Germany related to the growing housing scarcity in large cities due to intra- and international migration leading to a <b>geographical</b> <b>mismatch</b> between housing supply and demand...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{measures}} {{mismatch between}} job-seekers and vacancies in the U. S. labor market. Mismatch {{is defined as}} the distance between the observed allocation of unemployed workers across sectors and the optimal allocation that solves a planner’s problem. The planner’s allocation rule requires (produc-tive and matching) efficiency-weighted vacancy-unemployment ratios to be equated across sectors. More severe mismatch between vacant jobs and idle workers translates into higher unemployment by reducing the aggregate job-finding rate. In our empirical analysis, we use two sources of cross-sectional data on vacancies, JOLTS and HWOL, together with unemployment data from the CPS. We find that mismatch across industries and occupations accounts for 0. 6 to 1. 7 percentage points of the recent rise (by about five percentage points) in the U. S. unemployment rate, whereas <b>geographical</b> <b>mismatch</b> plays no role. The share of the rise in unemployment explained by mismatch is increasing in the education level...|$|E
40|$|Insect {{pollination}} benefits {{over three}} quarters of the world's major crops. There is growing concern that observed declines in pollinators may impact on production and revenues from animal pollinated crops. Knowing the distribution of pollinators is therefore crucial for estimating their availability to pollinate crops; however, in general, we have an incomplete knowledge of where these pollinators occur. We propose a method to predict geographical patterns of pollination service to crops, novel in two elements: the use of pollinator records rather than expert knowledge to predict pollinator occurrence, and the inclusion of the managed pollinator supply. We integrated a maximum entropy species distribution model (SDM) with an existing pollination service model (PSM) to derive the availability of pollinators for crop pollination. We used nation-wide records of wild and managed pollinators (honey bees) as well as agricultural data from Great Britain. We first calibrated the SDM on a representative sample of bee and hoverfly crop pollinator species, evaluating the effects of different settings on model performance and on its capacity to identify the most important predictors. The importance of the different predictors was better resolved by SDM derived from simpler functions, with consistent results for bees and hoverflies. We then used the species distributions from the calibrated model to predict pollination service of wild and managed pollinators, using field beans as a test case. The PSM allowed us to spatially characterize the contribution of wild and managed pollinators and also identify areas potentially vulnerable to low pollination service provision, which can help direct local scale interventions. This approach can be extended to investigate <b>geographical</b> <b>mismatches</b> between crop pollination demand and the availability of pollinators, resulting from environmental change or policy scenarios...|$|R

The existing empirical literature in this topic employs measures hardly useful to analyze the issue at hand. We use a model for non-stationary evolving distributions to identify disaggregate and aggregate disturbances and analyze their joint dynamics. Our main findings are that unemployment is lower the more alike shocks are across regions and the lower mobility of those regional shocks is. Further, the dynamics of regional shocks have substantial predictive power for aggregate unemployment fluctuations. regional fluctuations, <b>geographical</b> region, unemployment, <b>mismatch</b> index, large crosssection. ...|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to load balancing, nodes dynamics, and self-organizing capabilities, reduced latency {{is a crucial}} property in P 2 P networks [23, 24, 36, 37]. Latency in P 2 P network {{is related to the}} distributed nature of nodes. Nodes with adjacent addresses in the overlay might be located in different <b>geographical</b> areas. This <b>mismatch</b> between the overlay and the IP network is the major factor for increasing latency. For example, in SHAM, a direct neighbor is within one hop, yet, this same neighbor could be many hops away in the IP network. A remedy to this problem is to enable nodes to connect to physically nearby neighbors. Other method is utilizing clustering to impose physical proximity of overlay neighbors or even using geographical routing, i.e., geographic awareness [38, 39].|$|R
40|$|In most {{countries}} of Central and Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, {{the transition to}} market {{led to the emergence}} of a private sector and open unemployment. The Belarusian labor market is characterized by low official unemployment, combined with a low share of the private sector in the aggregate employment. However, the cumulative fall in employment since 1990 has been similar to other transition economies, leading to a sharp reduction of labor force, and the youth unemployment remains high. The mismatch in skills between the unemployed and the vacancies and the <b>geographical</b> <b>mismatch</b> suggest that policies aimed at improving skills and increasing mobility are needed. At the same time, the low vacancy-unemployment ratio calls for policies aimed at encouraging private job creation. An immediate policy concern for the government is to launch a labor market reform that would balance providing adequate protection for workers with the need to design the incentives for the unemployed workers to search for new jobs. labor markets, institutions, transition...|$|E
30|$|Our econometric {{analysis}} uses an ARDL model {{to test for}} the statistical significance of observed shifts {{and changes in the}} slope of the Beveridge curve since the onset of the global financial and economic crisis for both the euro area aggregate and the individual countries. We find a significant shift and change in the slope of the euro area Beveridge curve since the onset of the crisis, but considerable heterogeneity at country level. We extend our analysis to examine the likely preconditions underlying the observed developments, evaluating a range of country-specific factors—including labour force characteristics, sectoral employment composition and financial conditions—using the local projection method of Jordà (2005). We find evidence for skill mismatch, <b>geographical</b> <b>mismatch</b> and sectoral mismatch. However, only the latter seems to have a more permanent effect on the position of the Beveridge curve. A high share of low-skilled workers, a high home ownership rate and a high share of workers (previously) employed in the construction sector tend to shift the Beveridge curve outward in case of a negative shock. A high pre-crisis share of female workers in the labour force on the other hand tends to mitigate these effects.|$|E
40|$|Among marine {{habitats}} Sabellaria alveolata-reefs deserve protection {{since they}} provide important ecosystem services and {{positive effects on}} biodiversity. Several marine species are listed among the S. alveolata-reef associated fauna, but characteristic species were seldom reported. Eulalia ornata (Annelida, Phyllodocidae) might represent an exception, since it appears common/abundant in S. alveolata-reefs of the Eastern Atlantic. The most evident <b>geographical</b> <b>mismatch</b> in the distributions of E. ornata and these biogenic reefs occurs in the Mediterranean Sea, where S. alveolata-reefs are commonly found, but E. ornata was never recorded, whilst E. viridis, a non-Mediterranean species, was previously listed among the dominant reef-associated taxa. The faunal characterization of the sabellarid reefs along the Sicily Channel revealed an Eulalia species as the dominant taxon associated with that habitat in the area. A taxonomic approach integrated with DNA barcoding, and comparisons with closely related species, allow us to report E. ornata as a new record for the Mediterranean Sea. We describe patterns of abundance and distribution and corroborate {{its status as a}} preferential species in the S. alveolata-reef habitat. Focusing on the biology and ecology of E. ornata could help us to better understand the dynamics and functioning of this valuable European shallow marine habitat...|$|E

40|$|Land-use {{change is}} one of the major factors {{affecting}} global environmental change and represents a primary human effect on natural systems. Taking into account the scales and patterns of human land uses as source/sink disturbance systems, we describe a framework to characterize and interpret the spatial patterns of disturbances along a continuum of scales in a panarchy of nested jurisdictional social-ecological landscapes (SELs) like region, provinces, and counties. We detect and quantify those scales through the patterns of disturbance relative to land use/land cover exhibited on satellite imagery over a 4 -yr period in the Apulia region, South Italy. By using moving windows to measure composition (amount) and spatial configuration (contagion) of disturbance, we identify multiscale disturbance source/sink trajectories in the pattern metric space defined by composition and configuration of disturbance. We group disturbance trajectories along a continuum of scales for each location (pixel) according to broad land-use classes for each SEL level in the panarchy to identify spatial scales and geographical regions where disturbance is more or less concentrated in space indicating disturbance sources, sinks, and mismatches. We also group locations by clustering, and results are compared in the same pattern space and interpreted with respect to disturbance trajectories derived from random, multifractal and hierarchical neutral models. We show that in the real <b>geographical</b> world spatial <b>mismatches</b> of disturbances can occur at particular scale ranges because of cross scale disparities in land uses for the amount and contagion of disturbance, leading to more or less exacerbation of contrasting source/sink systems along certain scale domains. All cross-scale source/sink issues can produce both negative and positive effects on the scales above and below their levels, i. e., cross-scale effects. Through the framework outlined in our examples, managers, as well as stakeholders belonging to SELs in the panarchy, can be aware of specific scale ranges of disturbance where mismatches might occur and that will help them to value where and how to intervene in the panarchy of SELs to enhance the benefits and to minimize negative effects...|$|R

40|$|The {{provision}} of public services {{is a major}} function of local governments. The capability of local jurisdictions to fulfil this role depends upon the relationship between fiscal capacity and expenditure needs. The extent of the capacity-needs gap varies between jurisdictions {{in response to a}} host of economic, social and political factors. Such differences can lead to major socio-spatial disparities in levels of public service provision and in {{the quality of life for}} residents of different jurisdictions. These variations are particularly acute within metropolitan regions of advanced capitalist societies in which there is a <b>geographical</b> <b>mismatch</b> between increasingly extensive functional urban regions and politically constrained urban administrative units.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{we study}} labour markets, pension systems, {{and the interaction}} between the two. In the second chapter after the introduction we study the effects of fiscal changes in an overlapping-generations model. A labour tax increase reduces welfare more than a consumption tax increase and a tax swap makes all new-born generations better off. However, during transition it opens up a welfare gap between the retired (worse off) and the working (better off). In the third chapter we study the intergenerational effects of unemployment caused by wage rigidity on the accumulation of pension entitlements. We build an overlapping-generations model in which unions set the wages and firms pick employment. The pension system has an effect on steady state outcomes of labour market variables, but pension systems matter less for the transitional dynamics. The fourth chapter analyses euro area Beveridge curves over the past 25 years. We find an outward shift of the aggregate euro area, Spanish and French Beveridge curves since the onset of the crisis, but an inward shift for Germany. Examining the factors underlying the observed developments we find (tentative) evidence for skill, sectoral and <b>geographical</b> <b>mismatch.</b> In the fifth chapter we estimate wage equations to test for changes in the responsiveness of wages to unemployment using euro area panel estimates. Wages are less responsive at high levels of unemployment. Additionally, differences in bargaining position — in particularly differences between unionised vs. non-unionised labour and permanent vs. temporary jobs — explain {{a large part of the}} downward wage rigidity...|$|E
40|$|The Ecosystem Approach to {{environmental}} management, with its explicit {{acknowledgment of the}} environmental, social and economic elements within ecological systems, is becoming increasingly adopted by managers and policy makers. However, there are few specific prescriptions as to exactly how these different elements should be integrated, or examples where historical changes have been tracked. Here, we assess the potential benefits and challenges of applying an Ecosystem Approach to management using one particular method, the Holistic Ecosystem Health Indicator (HEHI), which integrates data from the ecological, social and interactive dimensions into a single composite index of ecosystem 'health'. We apply {{it to one of}} the best-documented catchments in the UK, the Ythan Estuary in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, based on a 50 -year time series of data. The evaluation of ecosystem health over time is lacking in previous applications of HEHI, yet is crucial for the assessment of the utility of this approach to ecosystem management. The application of HEHI yielded different insights to those revealed from the traditional application of biophysical approaches for managing the Ythan. Overall, ecological health declined through the 50 -year period, although it increased marginally in the last decade, while social and interactive dimensions followed the opposite trend. HEHI indicated a steady increase in ecosystem health overall except for the last decade, when it declined marginally. Our evaluation of the application of ecosystem health for the Ythan revealed major data gaps. For the approach to be used more widely, issues of data availability and the temporal and <b>geographical</b> <b>mismatch</b> between ecological and social research boundaries need to be overcome.

30|$|In recent years, the {{analysis}} of labour demand, supply and matching became increasingly based on online data (Askitas and Zimmermann 2009, 2015; Kuhn 2014; Kuhn and Mansour 2014). Internet data can contribute {{to our understanding of}} the labour market by filling the gaps that currently exist in the literature (Kureková et al. 2015). A first web data source that could be particularly useful in this case is a dataset extracted from online job portals. Many job boards are not limited to vacancies but also collect CVs and resumes and offer wage comparisons, employer evaluations and career advice. We do not cover portals in detail in this survey, but refer to Kureková et al. (2015). However, we do present some examples of recent contributions in this field. Marinescu (2015) uses CareerBuilder to investigate <b>geographical</b> <b>mismatch</b> in the USA, while Marinescu and Rathelot (2015) rely on this portal to study unemployment insurance. With a sample of vacancies from Burning Glass, Hershbein and Kahn (2015) provide evidence for upskilling: employers require more in areas with higher unemployment rates. Using a similar approach and dataset, Sasser Modestino et al. (2014) examine changes in employers during the Great Recession (2007 – 2012) and the subsequent recovery (2010 – 2012). In “bad” labour markets, employers are more demanding, in terms of both education and experience. Kudlyak et al. (2012) rely on matched applicant-vacancy data from SnagAJob to assess how job seekers’ behaviour changes during their job search. In another contribution based on SnagAJob, Faberman and Kudlyak (2014) report that job seekers’ search effort declines with search duration. Brenčič (2014) looks into information acquisition through portals and resume databases. Agrawal and Tambe (2014) use online resumes to track workers’ career paths, focusing on workers previously employed in firms acquired through leveraged buyouts.|$|E
