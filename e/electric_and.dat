5|$|Amtrak assumed {{control of}} almost all private sector {{intercity}} passenger rail service in the United States on May 1, 1971, with a mandate to reverse decades of decline. Amtrak retained approximately 184 of the 440 trains which had run the day before. To operate these trains, Amtrak inherited a fleet of 300 locomotives (<b>electric</b> <b>and</b> diesel) and 1190 passenger cars, most of which dated from the 1940s–1950s.|$|E
5|$|Experimental {{condensed}} matter physics {{involves the}} use of experimental probes to try to discover new properties of materials. Such probes include effects of <b>electric</b> <b>and</b> magnetic fields, measuring response functions, transport properties and thermometry. Commonly used experimental methods include spectroscopy, with probes such as X-rays, infrared light and inelastic neutron scattering; study of thermal response, such as specific heat and measuring transport via thermal and heat conduction.|$|E

5|$|After the Great Depression, the {{maintenance}} of the tramway system and the purchase of new trams suffered. Competition from private buses, the MTT's own bus fleet and the growth of private car ownership all took patrons from the tram network. By the 1950s, the tram network was losing money and being replaced by an <b>electric</b> <b>and</b> petrol-driven bus fleet. Adelaide's tram history is preserved by the volunteer-run Tramway Museum, St Kilda and the continuing use of 1929 H type trams on the remaining Glenelg tram line.|$|E

These cars were aging, in need of maintenance, {{and in many cases}} incompatible with each other. The company recognized the need and opportunity to standardize on a single design.|$|E

Despite entering the field at a time where engineering was seen as an inappropriate career for a woman, Hicks held a variety of leadership positions and eventually became the owner of an engineering firm. During her time there, Hicks developed a gas density switch that would be used in the U.S. space program, including the Apollo moon landing missions.|$|E
5|$|Contributing factors {{leading to}} this award {{included}} that during construction, 92% of construction waste was recycled, and non-wood wheat board {{was used in}} some of the walls. Additionally, 18 solar panels were installed on the building to generate power for use in the building, with the city purchasing all additional power through renewable power sources, funded in part by Portland General <b>Electric</b> <b>and</b> the Bonneville Environmental Foundation, while the building is 42% more energy efficient than comparable buildings. Other environmental friendly amenities include occupancy sensors, ventilation that monitors carbon dioxide levels to determine when to activate, high performance exterior glass to reduce heat loss, infrared bathroom fixtures, and the use of recycled building materials among other items.|$|E
5|$|Electricity in Utica is {{provided}} by National Grid plc, a British energy corporation that acquired the city's former electricity provider, Niagara Mohawk, in 2002. Utica is near the crossroads of major electrical-transmission lines, with substations {{in the town of}} Marcy. An expansion project by the New York Power Authority, National Grid, Consolidated Edison, and New York State <b>Electric</b> <b>and</b> Gas (NYSEG) is planned. In 2009 city businesses (including Utica College and St. Luke's Medical Center) developed a microgrid, and in 2012 the Utica City Council explored the possibility of a public, city-owned power company. Utica's natural gas {{is provided}} by National Grid and NYSEG.|$|E

5|$|Featuring {{only four}} engines, the design also {{required}} new engine designs with greatly increased power and better fuel economy. In May 1964, airframe proposals arrived from Boeing, Douglas, General Dynamics, Lockheed, and Martin Marietta; engine proposals were submitted by General Electric, Curtiss-Wright, and Pratt & Whitney. After a downselect, Boeing, Douglas, and Lockheed were given additional study contracts for the airframe, along with General <b>Electric</b> <b>and</b> Pratt & Whitney for the engines.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{deregulation}} of Montana's electricity market in 1997, Montana Power Company began to divest its energy business. MPC sold substantially all its electrical generating assets to the PPL Corporation in December 1997 and its energy {{transmission and distribution}} business to NorthWestern Corporation in February 2002. Despite filing for bankruptcy in 2002, NorthWestern Corporation's subsidiary NorthWestern Energy is the primary provider of <b>electric</b> <b>and</b> natural gas service to Missoula {{in addition to the}} Rural Utilities Service's Missoula Electric Cooperative.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Andrew Strominger {{published}} a similar result which suggested that strongly interacting strings in ten dimensions {{might have an}} equivalent description in terms of weakly interacting five-dimensional branes. Initially, physicists were unable to prove this relationship for two important reasons. On the one hand, the Montonen–Olive duality was still unproven, and so Strominger's conjecture was even more tenuous. On the other hand, there were many technical {{issues related to the}} quantum properties of five-dimensional branes. The first of these problems was solved in 1993 when Ashoke Sen established that certain physical theories require the existence of objects with both <b>electric</b> <b>and</b> magnetic charge which were predicted by the work of Montonen and Olive.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, Chrysler, General Motors, and Ford {{pledged to}} {{manufacture}} 50 {{percent of their}} entire vehicle line as flexible fuel in model year 2012, if enough fueling infrastructure develops. The Open Fuel Standard Act (OFS), introduced to Congress in May 2011, is intended to promote a massive adoption of flex-fuel vehicles capable of running on ethanol or methanol. The bill requires that 50 percent of automobiles made in 2014, 80 percent in 2016, and 95 percent in 2017, would be manufactured and warranted to operate on non-petroleum-based fuels, which includes existing technologies such as flex-fuel, natural gas, hydrogen, biodiesel, plug-in <b>electric</b> <b>and</b> fuel cell.|$|E
5|$|In {{the hours}} {{following}} the storm {{a state of}} emergency was declared in Halifax Regional Municipality and parts of neighbouring East Hants Municipal District and Colchester County. The Government of Nova Scotia requested that the federal government deploy 600 Canadian Forces personnel to assist local authorities in HRM with cleanup in the urban area and to assist utility crews with electrical power restoration. Many utility workers, especially those employed by Nova Scotia Power and the dozens of crews from Maritime <b>Electric</b> <b>and</b> NB Power who responded under mutual assistance agreements, worked for almost threeweeks without any considerable amount of rest. Many residents praised utility crews for their hard work in restoring the extensive damage.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, the US Air Force (USAF) {{was seeking}} an {{aircraft}} to replace its piston-engined Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star, {{which had been}} in service for over a decade. After issuing preliminary development contracts to three companies, the USAF picked Boeing to construct two airframes to test Westinghouse <b>Electric</b> <b>and</b> Hughes's competing radars. Both radars used pulse-Doppler technology, with Westinghouse's design emerging as the contract winner. Testing on the first production E-3 began in October 1975.|$|E
