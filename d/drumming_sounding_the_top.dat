40|$|In {{the field}} of civil engineering, <b>sounding</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> layer of carriageways, i. e., the {{pavement}} layer, is classically performed using standard ground-penetrating radar (GPR), whose resolution is bandwidth dependent. The layer thickness is deduced from both the time delays of backscattered echoes and the known dielectric constant of the medium. This paper focuses on superresolution and high-resolution techniques, which serve to improve the time resolution of GPR signals, and presents a parametric technique and five subspace methods, namely, estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT), multiple-signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm, Min-Norm, and their polynomial versions root-MUSIC and root-Min-Norm. The performance of these algorithms will be compared in terms of resolution power as well as root-mean-square error on the estimated thickness.

40|$|Abstract. Vertical {{distributions}} of aerosol backscattering were obtained on Transport and Atmospheric Chemistry Near the Equator [...] Atlantic (TRACE A) flights {{parallel to the}} west coast of Africa using the airborne differential absorption lidar (DIAL) instrument. Aerosol distributions on the flight of October 15, 1992 (from 22 øS to 5. 5 øS), exhibit strong horizontal and vertical gradients. <b>The</b> <b>top</b> of <b>the</b> aerosol layer ranges from 3. 5 to 5. 7 km above sea level, while its thickness ranges from 1. 4 to 4. 5 km. The greatest aerosol loading generally occurs near 4. 0 - to 4. 5 -km altitude between 8 ø and 12 øS. Meteorological conditions are found to exert a major influence on the aerosol distributions. Dropsonde data along the flight track indicate numerous temperature inversions and stable layers in each <b>sounding.</b> <b>The</b> <b>top</b> of <b>the</b> aerosol region is associated with strong inversions due to subsidence. Five-day backward trajectories are calculated along the flight track at vertical intervals of 1 km using global meteorological analyses. Trajectories arriving at most locations of large aerosol loading originate over southern Africa, where biomass burning is occurring and deep surface-based mixed layers are common. Conversely, the air with less aerosol loading originates over the Atlantic Ocean. The exception is the northernmost segment of the flight above 3. 5 km. Although this segment receives flow off Africa at these altitudes, lower level stable layers inhibit transport to higher levels. In addition, trajectories arriving at this part of the flight pass over a portion of Africa with reduced biomass burning and extensive deep convection that penetrates the stable layers. 1...|$|R

After the young cannibal makes another sandwich out of Popeye's meaty arm, and takes a bite this time, the hero acknowledges his predicament as he sees every native is holding a meat ration book and looking at him hungrily. It takes a horde of natives to overcome Popeye's resistance. They then proceed to flatten him {{into the shape of}} a juicy steak ready to be grilled. The sailor-steak manages to get out and eat his spinach, promptly defeating all the tribesmen then going after Joe, who takes shelter in a building from which he shoots many cannons at the hero. Popeye turns his own projectiles against him, however. Joe is sent flying to the water, where two hungry sharks await, only he is hungrier and chases them over the sea. Popeye becomes the tribe's new king, although he has to put up with the boy cannibal trying a Popeye-leg sandwich once again.|$|R

40|$|When {{electric}} soundings {{are made}} over an irregular terrain, topographic effects {{can influence the}} values of apparent resistivity and lead to erroneous 1 D interpretation. A 3 D finite-element method {{has been applied to}} study the topographical effect of a slope on Schlumberger <b>soundings</b> parallel to <b>the</b> strike. When the resistivity survey is performed at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of <b>the</b> slope, the apparent resistivity values can be two times higher than in the flat-earth case, depending on the angle (alpha) and height (H) of the slope, and on the distance (X) between <b>the</b> <b>sounding</b> and <b>the</b> slope <b>top.</b> <b>The</b> results are presented as nondimensional curves which can be used for evaluating topographic anomalies for any value of the parameters alpha, H and X. It is numerically shown that the topographic effects can be removed from measurements on horizontally layered structures with an irregular earth surface. Real measurements were performed in different geological conditions over an irregular terrain. The correction method based on the nondimensional curves has been applied to the data and has enabled the determination of the correct layered ground configuration using 1 D interpretation.

Measurements were made of wind speed and direction, air pressure and temperature, potential temperature, dewpoint, mixing ratio of H, O, CO, concentration, and ozone concentration. Twenty-five research missions were flown over the Northern Study Area (NSA), Southern Study Area (SSA), and the transect during BOREAS Intensive Field Campaigns (IFCs) 1, 2, and 3 during 1994.

Application of this technique to the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter (JIMO) mission will provide unique remote sensing observations of the plasma and magnetic field environments, and the subsurface conductivities, of Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Spatial structures of ionospheric plasma above the moon surfaces vary in response to magnetic field perturbations from (1) magnetospheric plasma flows, (2) ionospheric currents from ionization of sputtered surface material, and (3) induced electric currents in salty subsurface oceans. Radio sounding at 3 kHz to 10 MHz can provide globally-determined electron densities necessary for the extraction of the oceanic current signals and supplements in-situ plasma and magnetic field measurements. Subsurface variations in conductivity, can be investigated by radio sounding from 10 MHz to 40 MHz allowing {{the determination of the}} presence of dense and solid-liquid phase boundaries associated with oceans and related structures in overlying ice crusts...|$|R
