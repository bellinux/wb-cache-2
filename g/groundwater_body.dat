The last decades stakeholders are {{more aware of the}} risks posed by these sites. Within the Frac-Weco project an integrated framework for the assessment, at regional scale, of the risks posed by these contaminated sites on water resources and ecosystems has been developed. The methodology is based on the calculation of contaminant fluxes reaching the receptors providing a way of estimating the level of exposure/degradation of these receptors at the <b>groundwater</b> <b>body</b> scale. The most important contamination problems at regional scale are located around old urban and industrialized areas. The land-cover distribution in these zones is of prime importance because it determines the spatial variation of groundwater recharge, which is the main vector of contaminant leaching from soil surface to groundwater. To obtain detailed information about land cover for groundwater recharge modeling, a stratified satellite image classification approach was adopted combining land-cover mapping at pixel level for the studied area as a whole with sub-pixel estimation of imperviousness within built-up zones. The obtained land-cover data is used as an input in the WetSpass model to simulate groundwater recharge at high resolution in spatially complex urban areas. In the next step the simulated groundwater recharge is used as an input in a regional scale groundwater flow and transport model simulating contaminant dispersion through the aquifer.

Sixty-five percentage of studied areas were impacted with contaminants (those being by order of importance metals, hydrocarbons, HVOCs and BTEX) originating from around 420 sites. An impact rate (None /local / wide) was attributed for each site / contaminant couple.

It is estimated that annual aquifer recharge in Spain is about 30 % of the total water resources available in the country. Groundwater abstraction is mainly used for irrigation, and often concentrated in some intensively exploited aquifers in the Mediterranean side of the Iberian Peninsula. According to the official figures 699 <b>groundwater</b> <b>bodies</b> have been identified in Spain and 259 (38. 65 %) of these <b>groundwater</b> <b>bodies</b> are classified “at risk ” of not achieving the environmental objectives of the WFD. Groundwater in Spain is a public domain resource since 1985. The changes introduced by the 1985 Water Act and the successive reforms were necessary to deal with the challenges resulting from the more intensive use of groundwater resources. However its implementation has encountered many difficulties which in some ways continue up to date. As all the European Member States, Spain has recently transposed the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) into Spanish law. The WFD states that groundwater abstraction should no...|$|R
40|$|The {{intergranular}} aquifer of Ljubljana Field and {{the aquifer}} system of Ljubljana Moor {{are the most}} important sources of drinking water for Ljubljana. The springs that appear on the area of both <b>groundwater</b> <b>bodies</b> reflect the <b>groundwater</b> status, quantity and quality. The spring water in the Ljubljana Field appears on vowel change of the gravel terrace. We follow them in the lower part of Ljubljana Field aquiferfrom Fu‘ine to confluence of rivers Sava and Ljubljanica. The spring water directly indicates the condition of groundwater level and the quality. On the Ljubljana Barje there are important springs on the southern edge. These springs are crucial observation point for the quality and quantity status monitoring of the inflow fro main recharge area of Ljubljana Moor aquifers that are exploited for the water supplysystem. By the detailed analysis of older sporadic measurements of springs in Ljubljana Polje and Ljubljansko barje we were able to assess the changes in theirs trends of quantity and to design the monitoring network of springs that would acquire adequate data for the actual and future assessment of quantity an quality of these <b>groundwater</b> <b>bodies</b> in the frame of all other available and representative observation points...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the goal}} for the {{preparation}} of Nemunas RBD management plan {{is to provide a}} description of the current state of RBD, including the assess of groundwater discharge into surface water <b>bodies.</b> <b>Groundwater</b> discharge into surface water bodies in Nemunas RBD was carried out in four independent mathematical models for individual <b>groundwater</b> <b>bodies</b> (GWB). Models included shallow groundwater, surface water and deeper laying confined aquifers. The obtained results later were combined. Transmissivity values and recharge rates of shallow groundwater aquifer have been revised by mathematical modelling. Sources of groundwater runoff formation, i. e. an input of groundwater flow from the unconfined aquifer and deeper confined aquifers into surface water bodies, were evaluated. In addition groundwater discharge variation throughout the river length was itemized...|$|R
