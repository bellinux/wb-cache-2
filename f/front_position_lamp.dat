25|$|The <b>front</b> <b>position</b> <b>lamps</b> on any vehicle may emit {{white or}} amber {{light in the}} US, Canada, Mexico, Iceland, Japan, New Zealand {{and much of the}} Middle East; {{elsewhere}} in the world only motorcycles may have amber <b>front</b> <b>position</b> lamps; all other vehicles must have white ones. Colloquial city light terminology for <b>front</b> <b>position</b> <b>lamps</b> derives from the practice, formerly adhered to in cities like Moscow, London and Paris, of driving at night in built-up areas using these low-intensity lights rather than headlamps.|$|R

25|$|Conspicuity for {{the rear}} of a vehicle is {{provided}} by rear <b>position</b> <b>lamps</b> (also called tail lamps or tail lights). These are required to produce only red light and to be wired such that they are lit whenever the <b>front</b> <b>position</b> <b>lamps</b> are lit, including when the headlamps are on. Rear <b>position</b> <b>lamps</b> may be combined with the vehicle's stop lamps or separate from them. In combined-function installations, the lamps produce brighter red light for the stop lamp function and dimmer red light for the rear <b>position</b> <b>lamp</b> function. Regulations worldwide stipulate minimum intensity ratios between the bright (stop) and dim (rear position) modes, so that a vehicle displaying rear <b>position</b> <b>lamps</b> will not be mistakenly interpreted as showing stop lamps, and vice versa.|$|R

5000|$|The dim-dip {{lights were}} not {{intended}} for use as daytime running lights. Rather, they operated when the engine was running and the driver switched on the <b>front</b> <b>position</b> (parking) <b>lamps.</b> Dim-dip was intended to provide a nighttime [...] "town beam" [...] with intensity between that of the parking lamps commonly used at the time by British drivers in city traffic after dark, and low beam headlamps; the former were considered insufficiently intense to provide improved conspicuity in conditions requiring it, while the latter were considered too glaring for safe use in built-up areas. The UK was the only country to require such dim-dip systems, though vehicles so equipped were sold in other Commonwealth countries with left-hand traffic.|$|R
50|$|Vehicles are {{equipped}} {{with a variety of}} lights and reflectors to mark their presence, position, width, length, and direction of travel as well as to convey the driver's intent and actions to other drivers. These include the vehicle's headlamps, <b>front</b> and rear <b>position</b> <b>lamps,</b> side marker lights and reflectors, turn signals, stop (brake) lamps, and reversing lamps. School buses and Semi-trailer trucks in North America are required to bear retroreflective strips outlining their side and rear perimeters for greater conspicuity at night.|$|R
50|$|On 6 December 2014, Proton {{introduced}} the Suprima S Standard, a new base model variant which undercuts the Suprima S Executive {{by as much}} as RM6,900. The Suprima S Standard loses some equipment and trim, including several safety features, and offers several new, albeit downgraded components to achieve its lower pricing. The omissions include several interior components like the Android OS-powered Proton Infotainment System in favour of the more basic head-unit from the Proton Prevé Executive variant, as well as the lack of steering audio switches, YES 4G internet connectivity, and the rear lid on the floor console between the two front seats. On the exterior, the Suprima S loses the front foglights, engine cover and the black tape on the B-pillar sashes. The Suprima S Standard is fitted with the ten-spoke alloy rims first seen on the Proton Prevé, and not the hubcaps from the Proton Exora Bold Standard CFE as speculated from spyshots several days prior to the launch. The most significant omissions in the Suprima S Standard are its safety features; it is only equipped with dual front airbags, ABS and EBD, and is not equipped with side and curtain airbags, electronic stability control (ESC), traction control (TCS) and brake assist (BA), which are all offered in the Suprima S Executive. The anti-trap feature in the front power windows, front reactive headrest, driver-side overhead handle grip and seat belt reminder for the front passenger have also been omitted. Nonetheless, the Suprima S Standard comes with a new Panther Grey finish for the front dashboard panels and <b>front</b> <b>position</b> <b>lamps</b> which are of the bulb type, instead of the L.E.D. type on the Executive trim. The rest of the specifications, including the powertrain were left largely unchanged, and the Proton Suprima S Standard is priced at RM69,438 and RM69,888 for the solid and metallic paint options respectively, both on-the-road prices with insurance. Proton hopes to triple sales of the Suprima S with this new base model.|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} non-perturbative {{description}} of stationary flames with arbitrary gas expansion is considered. A general method for deriving equations for the flame <b>front</b> <b>position</b> is developed. On {{the basis of}} the Thomson circulation theorem an implicit integral of the flow equations is constructed. With the help of this integral the flow structure near the flame front is determined, and a closed system of equations for the flame <b>front</b> <b>position</b> and a set of auxiliary quantities is obtained. This system is shown to be quasi-local, and its transverse representation is found. This representation allows reduction of the system to a single equation for the flame <b>front</b> <b>position.</b> The developed approach is applied to the case of zero-thickness flames.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to present some {{improvements}} in the metrology of forest fire flames by coupling image processing and radiative heat flux measurement. A new metrological tool using a visual video camera and a specific multiple thermal sensors is proposed. By means of an appropriate segmentation algorithm and the Direct Linear Transformation, the image processing methodology gives the forward or the backward fire <b>front</b> <b>positions</b> as input data to a radiative heat flux approach. Using a simplified flame model, this technique provides fire <b>front</b> <b>positions</b> versus time, and average values for the flame length, flame depth, flame tilt angle, apparent flame temperature and flame emissivity. The rates of spread, obtained by a linear regression of the determined fire <b>front</b> <b>positions,</b> as well as the thermal and radiative properties of the flame, are compared favorably to those given in the literature...|$|R

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of A+B->C fronts is analyzed theoretically {{in the presence}} of passive advection when A is injected radially into B at a constant inlet flow rate Q. We compute the long-time evolution of the <b>front</b> <b>position,</b> rf, of its width, w, and of the local production rate R of the product C at rf. We show that, while advection does not change the well-known scaling exponents of the evolution of corresponding reaction-diffusion fronts, their dynamics is however significantly influenced by the injection. In particular, the total amount of product varies as Q^{- 1 / 2 } for a given volume of injected reactant and the <b>front</b> <b>position</b> as Q^{ 1 / 2 } for a given time, paving the way to a flow control of the amount and spatial distribution of the reaction front product. This control strategy compares well with calcium carbonate precipitation experiments for which the amount of solid product generated in flow conditions at fixed concentrations of reactants and the <b>front</b> <b>position</b> can be tuned by varying the flow rate. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

We then obtain precise asymptotics of the <b>front</b> <b>position</b> by means of singularity analysis. In particular, we recover the so-called Ebert and van Saarloos correction [2], we obtain an additional term of order log t/t in this expansion, and we give precise conditions on the initial condition for those terms to be present...|$|R
