25|$|Two {{members of}} the winning family play Fast Money {{for a chance to}} win a cash bonus. One {{contestant}} is onstage with the host, while the other is sequestered backstage so that he/she cannot hear the first portion of the round. The first contestant is asked five rapid-fire survey questions and has a set time limit in which to answer them (originally 15 seconds, extended to 20 in 1994). The clock begins to run only after the <b>first</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> asked, and the first contestant may pass on a question and return to it after all five have been asked, if time remains.|$|E
25|$|The {{answer to}} the <b>first</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> {{provided}} by introducing the Zariski topology, a topology on An whose closed sets are the algebraic sets, and which directly reflects the algebraic structure of k. Then U = V(I(U)) {{if and only if}} U is an algebraic set or equivalently a Zariski-closed set. The {{answer to the}} second question is given by Hilbert's Nullstellensatz. In one of its forms, it says that I(V(S)) is the radical of the ideal generated by S. In more abstract language, there is a Galois connection, giving rise to two closure operators; they can be identified, and naturally play a basic role in the theory; the example is elaborated at Galois connection.|$|E
25|$|Philosophy is {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} life of reason, with normal human reason pursued in a more consistent and dedicated way than usual. Two categories of problem concerning reason have long been discussed by philosophers concerning reason, essentially being reasonings about reasoning itself as a human aim, or philosophizing about philosophizing. The <b>first</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> concerning whether we can be confident that reason can achieve knowledge of truth better than other ways of trying to achieve such knowledge. The other question is whether a life of reason, a life that aims to be guided by reason, {{can be expected to}} achieve a happy life more so than other ways of life (whether such a life of reason results in knowledge or not).|$|E

2500|$|Objectivism {{includes}} an extensive treatment of ethical concerns. Rand wrote on morality in her works The Virtue of Selfishness, We the Living, and Atlas Shrugged. Rand defines morality as [...] "a code of values to guide man's choices and actions—the choices and actions that determine {{the purpose and}} {{the course of his}} life." [...] Rand maintained that the <b>first</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> not what should the code of values be, the <b>first</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> [...] "Does man need values at all—and why?" [...] According to Rand, [...] "it is only the concept of 'Life' that makes the concept of 'Value' possible," [...] and, [...] "the fact that a living entity is, determines what it ought to do." [...] Rand writes: [...] "there is only one fundamental alternative in the universe: existence or non-existence—and it pertains to a single class of entities: to living organisms. The existence of inanimate matter is unconditional, the existence of life is not: it depends on a specific course of action... It is only a living organism that faces a constant alternative: the issue of life or death..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Once the {{question}} is reformulated as dating the transition {{of the evolution of}} H. sapiens from a precursor species, the issue can be refined into two further questions. These are: the analysis and dating of the evolution of Archaic Homo sapiens, and of the evolution from [...] "archaic" [...] forms of the species H. sapiens sapiens. The second question is given an answer in two parts: anatomically modern humans are thought to be about 200,000 years old, with behavioral modernity dating back to 40,000 or 50,000 years ago. The <b>first</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> still subject to debates on its definition.|$|E
2500|$|Ship of Theseus: [...] Briefly, {{the puzzle}} goes {{something}} like this. There is a ship called the Ship of Theseus. Overtime the boards start to rot so we remove the boards {{and place them in}} a pile. <b>First</b> <b>question,</b> <b>is</b> the ship made of the new boards the same as the ship that had all the old boards? Second, if we reconstruct a ship using all of the old planks, etc. from the Ship of Theseus, and we also have a ship that was built out of new boards (each added one-by-one over time to replace old decaying boards), which ship is the real Ship of Theseus? ...|$|E
3000|$|To measure daily {{internet}} use and activities with ESM, the text message surveys included three <b>questions.</b> The <b>first</b> <b>question</b> <b>was,</b> “Are you currently online?” Answer options to the <b>first</b> <b>question</b> <b>were</b> Y for yes and N for no. The second <b>question</b> <b>was,</b> “If so, {{for how many}} minutes have you been online?” For this second <b>question,</b> participants <b>were</b> instructed to numerically enter the number of minutes they had been online.

2500|$|Know Your Product, {{where each}} team chooses {{one of four}} given topics – three {{questions}} around this topic are then asked which either team can answer. The questions are usually ordered by points allocated {{and the number of}} answers needed. (e.g. <b>first</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> worth one point, but only one answer is needed, the second question is worth two points and requires two answers, and the final question is worth three points and has three answers). This game is played first in every episode. In special episodes the topic is the show's theme which has 5 questions of which the 4th & 5th questions have 4 & 5 answers respectively. Named after the song by The Saints.|$|E
2500|$|The {{answer to}} the <b>first</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> , as is {{correctly}} shown by the [...] "simple" [...] solutions. But the {{answer to the}} second question is now different: the conditional probability the car is behind door 1 or door 2 given the host has opened door 3 (the door on the right) is [...] This is because Monty's preference for rightmost doors means that he opens door 3 if the car is behind door 1 (which it is originally with probability [...] ) or if the car is behind door 2 (also originally with probability [...] ). For this variation, the two questions yield different answers. However, as long as the initial probability the car is behind each door is , it is never to the contestant's disadvantage to switch, as the conditional probability of winning by switching is always at least [...] (Morgan et al. 1991) ...|$|E
2500|$|In Switzerland, {{a secret}} force called P-26 was discovered, by coincidence, {{a few months}} before Giulio Andreotti's October 1990 revelations. After the [...] "secret files scandal" [...] (Fichenaffäre), Swiss members of {{parliament}} [...] started investigating the Defense Department in the summer of 1990. According to Felix Würsten of the ETH Zurich, [...] "P-26 was not directly involved in the network of NATO's secret armies but it had close contact to MI6." [...] Daniele Ganser (ETH Zurich) wrote in the Intelligence and National Security review that [...] "following the discovery of the stay-behind armies across Western Europe in late 1990, Swiss and international security researchers found themselves confronted with two clear-cut questions: Did Switzerland also operate a secret stay-behind army? And if yes, was it part of NATO's stay-behind network? The answer to the <b>first</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> clearly yes... The answer to the second question remains disputed..." ...|$|E
