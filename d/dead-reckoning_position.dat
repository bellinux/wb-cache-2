40|$|Navigation is a {{critical}} requirement for the operation of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). To estimate the vehicle position, we present an algorithm using an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to integrate <b>dead-reckoning</b> <b>position</b> with acoustic ranges from multiple beacons pre-deployed in the operating environment. Owing to high latency, variable sound speed multipath transmissions and unreliability in acoustic measurements, outlier recognition techniques are proposed as well. The navigation algorithm has been tested by the recorded data of deep sea AUV during field operations {{in a variety of}} environments. Our results show the improved performance over prior techniques based on position computation...|$|E

This 3 D model provides a realistic representation of the navigation environment of the vehicle. To optimize the performance of vehicle geo-localization system, several sources of information are used for their complementarity and redundancy: a GPS receiver, proprioceptive sensors (odometers and gyrometer), a video camera and a virtual 3 D city model as a priori information. The pose estimation algorithm used to fuse the different sensors data in IMM-UKF (Interacting Multiple Model - Unscented Kalman Filter). The proprioceptive sensors allow to continuously estimating the <b>dead-reckoning</b> <b>position</b> and orientation of the vehicle. This dead-reckoning estimation of the pose is corrected by GPS measurements. Moreover, a 3 D model based observation of the vehicle pose is constructed to compensate the drift of the dead-reckoning localization when GPS measurements are unavailable for a long time. This pose observation is based on the matching between the virtual image extracted from the 3 D city model and the real image acquired by the camera. The observation construction is composed of two major parts. The first part consists in detecting and matching the feature points of the real and virtual images. Three features are compared: Harris corner detector, SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) and SURF (Speed Up Robust Features). The second part is the pose computation using POSIT algorithm and the previously matched features set. The developed approach has been tested on a real sequence and the obtained results proved the feasibility and robustness of the approach...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Unmanned {{underwater}} vehicles (UUVs) {{are increasingly}} being used as efficient and cost-effective Intelligent Preparation of the Operational Environment (IPOE) platforms by the Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO), which seeks to provide Bat-tlespace on Demand to the US Navy warfighter. One such UUV, the Teledyne/Webb Slocum Electric Glider, was utilized during four US Naval exercises {{in the past year}} to provide environmental data in support of Navy operations. Folding Slocum Glider missions into tactical operations has numerous benefits: the Slocum Glider (1) provides high-resolution optical and physical data in shallow coastal environments in real-time, (2) maintains a low profile when surfaced, (3) is piloted remotely with minimal manpower, (4) can be dep-loyed over-the-horizon, and (5) reduces the amount of time an asset spends off-mission for the sake of IPOE measurements. Environ-mental data include sound velocity profiles, water clarity, and current velocity. The scientific payload for the Slocum Gliders in the NAVOCEANO glider inventory consists of a CTD probe and an optical backscattering sensor. Sound velocity profiles are derived from the CTD, water clarity is inferred from the backscattering data, and depth-averaged currents are determined by offsets between sub-surface <b>dead-reckoning</b> <b>position</b> estimates and actual surface Global Positioning System (GPS) position fixes. One issue pertaining to the optical data {{is that many of the}} optical products utilized are based on beam attenuation and not optical backscattering. Conse-quently, optical backscattering data from the NAVOCEANO Slocum glider data must be converted to beam attenuation to be utilized for algorithms that create optical products. The work presented here examines the optical backscattering to beam attenuation relation-ship of glider-based observations of four distinct coastal water masses, as described by the Jerlov Optical Ocean Water Mass Classifica...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} localize underwater gliders in observation networks, and this method is also applicable to other vehicles. Utilizing the travel time of acoustic signals from near-surface acoustic sources, the <b>dead-reckoning</b> <b>positions</b> of underwater gliders can be refined. Specifically, compare two kinds of travel time, one is simulated by an acoustic model {{for a series of}} possible positions of underwater gliders, and the other is the measured travel time for real positions of underwater gliders, then the most possible positions of gliders can be estimated, also the speed of ocean currents. The method formulation is based on particle filters, which could improve performance of the positioning system over time. Simulation is conducted according to experimental environment in the South China Sea, and the positioning results are compared with the <b>dead-reckoning</b> <b>positions</b> derived from experimental data, validating the effectiveness of this method. <br type="_moz" /...|$|R

40|$|The LORAN {{program is}} stored in CMS disk files for use by Avionics Engineering Center {{terminal}} users. A CMS EXEC file named LORAN controls program operation. The user types LORAN and the program then prompts for data input and produces output on the terminal. The FORTRAN program refers to a disk file of LORAN master data giving station locations, coding delays, repetition rate and station pair identification letters. For Geographic-to-LORAN conversion, no iterative computations are required; the program is a straightforward coordinate conversion based upon the techniques described by the Navy. For LORAN-to-Geographic conversion, the original Navy program required a <b>dead-reckoned</b> <b>position,</b> near the actual unknown fix, to begin computations. No iteration was performed to obtain the LORAN fix, but internal program errors occurred at execution time if the dead-reckoned fix were displaced from the actual fix {{by more than a}} few minutes of latitude or longitude. In order to enhance usefulness of the program for the terminal user, an iterative routine was added which allows a single <b>dead-reckoned</b> <b>position</b> to be entered from the master data file for each LORAN chain. The results compare exactly with the LORAN-C navigation chart, and provide adequate benchmark data for general aviation flight planning and data analysis...|$|R
40|$|Sensor {{fusion of}} a MEMS IMU with a {{magnetometer}} {{is a popular}} system design, because such 9 -DoF (degrees of freedom) systems are capable of achieving drift-free 3 D orientation tracking. However, these systems are often vulnerable to ambient magnetic distortions and lack useful position information; {{in the absence of}} external position aiding (e. g. satellite/ultra-wideband <b>positioning</b> systems) the <b>dead-reckoned</b> <b>position</b> accuracy from a 9 -DoF MEMS IMU deteriorates rapidly due to unmodelled errors. Positioning information is valuable in many satellite-denied geomatics applications (e. g. indoor navigation, location-based services, etc.). This paper proposes an improved 9 -DoF IMU indoor pose tracking method using batch optimization. By adopting a robust in-situ user self-calibration approach to model the systematic errors of the accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer simultaneously in a tightly-coupled post-processed least-squares framework, the accuracy of the estimated trajectory from a 9 -DoF MEMS IMU can be improved. Through a combination of relative magnetic measurement updates and a robust weight function, the method is able to tolerate a high level of magnetic distortions. The proposed auto-calibration method was tested in-use under various heterogeneous magnetic field conditions to mimic a person walking with the sensor in their pocket, a person checking their phone, and a person walking with a smartwatch. In these experiments, the presented algorithm improved the in-situ dead-reckoning orientation accuracy by 79. 8 – 89. 5  % and the <b>dead-reckoned</b> <b>positioning</b> accuracy by 72. 9 – 92. 8  %, thus reducing the relative positioning error from metre-level to decimetre-level after ten seconds of integration, without making assumptions about the user’s dynamics...|$|R
30|$|The {{inner layer}} with short time scale loop is {{integrated}} in the onboard controller inside each glider. This layer receives the command waypoints {{from the outer}} layer and control the glider {{to move to the}} desired waypoints. Since endurance of the glider is very important for the long-term marine observation, a LEC (least energy consumption) algorithm is designed to minimize the energy cost in the glider motion. The distance between neighbor waypoints is calculated as the input of LEC and the optimal control variables are generated as the optimization output. The influence of ocean flow is considered by the controller. The glider gets its position every time it surfaces and estimates the flow velocity by comparing the <b>position</b> with the <b>dead-reckoned</b> <b>position</b> (DK position) or that of the desired waypoint. The controller makes decision to decrease the influence of the flow by determining the heading angle of the glider and outputs the flow speed into the LEC to obtain optimal control variables. The onboard subsystem controller based on PID control will achieve the motion control under the optimal command. This control cycle loops every profile, so the inner layer is under a short-time loop by profiles.|$|R

On the night of 16-17 June, she was ordered to Kiska. On 18 June, she reconnoitered Constantine Harbor, found no signs of enemy activity in that evacuated village, and moved on to round the southern end of the island, whence she would proceed to Kiska. In mid-afternoon, she rounded East Cape and that night when she surfaced, fog obscured her position. Lying to charge on both engines, she was carried about 5 mi from her estimated <b>dead-reckoned</b> <b>position.</b> The fog prevented knowledge of the drift. At midnight, she got underway, slowly, on one engine and continued to charge on the other. Soon after 00:43 on 19 June, breakers were sighted about 25 yd forward of the bow.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a computational model of spatial learning and localization in rodents. The model {{is based on}} the suggestion (based on a large body of experimental data) that rodents learn metric spatial representations of their environments by associating sensory inputs with <b>dead-reckoning</b> based <b>position</b> estimates in the hippocampal place cells. Both these sources of information have some uncertainty associated with them because of errors in sensing, range estimation, and path integration. The proposed model incorporates explicit mechanisms for information fusion from uncertain sources. We demonstrate that the proposed model adequately reproduces several key results of behavioral experiments with animals. Introduction Animals demonstrate a wide range of complex spatial learning and navigation abilities (Gallistel, 1990). Considerable research effort has been expended in understanding different aspects of these spatial behaviors. These efforts have resulted in a large corpus of ex [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Bio-Inspired Technologies and Systems (BITS) are a {{very natural}} result of {{thinking}} about Nature's way of solving problems. Knowledge of animal behaviors an be used in developing robotic behaviors intended for planetary exploration. This is the expertise of the JFL BITS Group and {{has served as a}} philosophical model for NMSU RioRobolab. Navigation is a vital function for any autonomous system. Systems must have the ability to determine a safe path between their current location and some target location. The MER mission, as well as other JPL rover missions, uses a method known as <b>dead-reckoning</b> to determine <b>position</b> information. <b>Dead-reckoning</b> uses wheel encoders to sense the wheel's rotation. In a sandy environment such as Mars, this method is highly inaccurate because the wheels will slip in the sand. Improving positioning error will allow the speed of an autonomous navigating rover to be greatly increased. Therefore, local navigation based upon landmark tracking is desirable in planetary exploration. The BITS Group is developing navigation technology based upon landmark tracking. Integration of the current rover architecture with a cerebellar neural network tracking algorithm will demonstrate that this approach to navigation is feasible and should be implemented in future rover and spacecraft missions...|$|R

" The brief suggested a number of aspects to be included, and required detailed proposals, timescales and costs for implementation in London. 1. 1. 2 The background to the brief lies in decisions to introduce pilot automatic route guidance systems in the two cities. The principles of the systems are similar, and have been described in detail elsewhere (Jeffery, 1987). In brief, they involve : (i) a central computer which retains information on a specified road network, which is updated using real time information from the equipment users; (ii) infra red beacons at selected junctions which transmit information to equipped vehicles and receive information from those vehicles; (iii) in-vehicle equipment which includes a <b>dead-reckoning</b> system for <b>position</b> finding, a device for requesting guidance and specifying the destination, a micro-computer which selects the optimal route, and a display which indicates when a turn is required on the main network, and the compass direction and distance to the final destination; iv) transmission from the equipped vehicles of origin, requested destination, links used since passing the last beacon and, for each link, the time of entry and departure and time spent delayed. It is this travel time information which is used to update the central computer's knowledge of the best routes. (Continues [...] ) ...|$|R
