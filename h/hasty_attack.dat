2500|$|The Bir Hakeim box was {{defended by}} the 1st Free French Brigade under Marie-Pierre Koenig. On 27 May, an Italian tank {{battalion}} of the [...] "Ariete" [...] Division, {{which had not}} been engaged {{in the destruction of}} the 3rd Indian Brigade box and had continued to advance alone at full speed, stumbled in the French positions and launched a <b>hasty</b> <b>attack,</b> which was a costly failure against the French [...] guns and mines. On the night of [...] the 90th Light and Trieste divisions were sent south to renew the attack on Bir Hakeim, where the battle continued for another ten days.|$|E
2500|$|At a conference, Wilson {{decided that}} the 47th Division should control a {{counter-attack}} at [...] on 23 May, after the moon was up, by the 99th Brigade, 2nd Division, the 142nd Brigade, 47th Division and the 7th Brigade of the 25th Division. Haig intervened later that day to insist that no <b>hasty</b> <b>attack</b> be made and the counter-attack was postponed until dusk on 24 May. On the night of [...] more artillery batteries were brought into action to fire on the new German positions and links to the rear. The 140th Brigade was withdrawn and replaced by the 99th Brigade and battalions of the 141st Brigade were relieved by part of the 142nd Brigade. The Germans kept up an intense bombardment of Zouave Valley, which made the reliefs more difficult and was apparently prompted by a British deserter, who told the Germans that a counter-attack would begin late on 22 May.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is as I expected," [...] Sir Eustace remarked; [...] "they {{have gone}} to prepare {{materials}} for a regular attack. It may be delivered to-night, or may be delayed {{for a day or}} two; however, we shall be ready for them. Jean Bouvard, do you go round the walls and tell all, save a few as sentries, to retire until the watchman blows his horn to warn us if they seem to be gathering for an attack; and do you, Long Tom, give the same orders to your archers. There is no use wasting the men's strength till the work begins in earnest. If Sir Clugnet is wise he will march away at once. He would need heavy machines and cannon to make a breach in our walls, and even had he an abundance of them it would take him some time to do so. If he tries again, you may be sure that it will be the work of Sir Hugh de Fruges, who has no doubt a lively interest in the matter. He is a clever fellow, and will no doubt do his best to work on the feelings of the other knights by representing that it would be disgraceful for so large a force to abandon the enterprise merely because a first <b>hasty</b> <b>attack,</b> delivered without preparation, had been repulsed. The fact that they have made so careful an examination of the castle would seem in itself to show that they intended to renew the attempt in another form if the first onset failed, and, moreover, the scattering of the force afterwards while the knights still remained with a large body here points in the same direction." ...|$|E
5000|$|Gough's {{conduct of}} the Somme and Third Ypres was {{strongly}} criticised by the Australian Official Historian Bean (1929 and 1933). Gough angrily denied Bean's account of the events at Pozi√®res in July 1916 (Edmonds, the British Official Historian, had passed on his comments to Bean in 1927) and Bean's claim (in the 1916 volume, published 1929) that he was [...] "temperamentally" [...] prone to <b>hasty</b> <b>attacks</b> without proper reconnaissance.|$|R
5000|$|The Second Battle of Bullecourt (3-15 May) was [...] "memorably {{bloody and}} ill-rewarded". Sanders Marble writes: [...] "The results could largely have been {{predicted}} before {{so many lives}} were lost. <b>Hasty</b> <b>attacks</b> failed with heavy losses. Once adequate time was allowed for preparations the village was finally wrested from the Germans ... {{it was not the}} BEF's finest hour" [...] Bullecourt [...] "did not win many plaudits" [...] and further worsened Gough's reputation {{in the eyes of the}} Australians.|$|R
2500|$|The British {{official}} historian, Cyril Falls, {{described the}} great difficulty in moving over devastated ground beyond the British front line. Carrying supplies and equipment over roads behind the original British front line was even worse, due to over-use, repeated freezing and thaws, {{the destruction of}} the roads beyond no man's land and demolitions behind the German front line. The British command was reluctant to risk unsupported forces against a German counter-attack and the evidence from the Fifth Army front, that <b>hasty</b> <b>attacks</b> became impractical once the Germans had begun the main retirement [...] led to a steady pursuit instead. The Australian official historian, Charles Bean, wrote that the advanced troops of I Anzac Corps had gone out on a limb, which had led to the reverse at Noreuil on 20 March, after instructions from the Fifth Army headquarters to press forward to the Hindenburg Line, were misinterpreted.|$|R
5000|$|Successful hasty attacks rely much {{upon the}} commander's sense of timing in {{executing}} the critical tasks {{in the proper}} sequence. The ability to synchronize, concentrate and apply all the different forms of offensive capability available against the enemy at the right times and places is crucial to a good <b>hasty</b> <b>attack.</b> The decision to conduct a <b>hasty</b> <b>attack</b> is usually made after reconnaissance of an enemy force shows that {{the element of surprise}} has presented a compelling opportunity or winning requires a quick strike with little preparation. According to FM 17-97, tactics for conducting a <b>hasty</b> <b>attack</b> have three common features: ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{executing}} {{a successful}} <b>hasty</b> <b>attack,</b> the following tasks are considered critical: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{commander}} may first {{become aware}} of the possibility for <b>hasty</b> <b>attack</b> when scouts in contact with the enemy recommend a <b>hasty</b> <b>attack</b> as a course of action. The unit commander may then decide to execute the recommended course of action. In that case the commander will then issue orders to position forces to execute an attack with minimal planning and preparation.|$|E
5000|$|While {{this was}} {{happening}} [...] "C" [...] Company was fulfilling a task of its own, securing a road junction to provide a maintenance route for 6th Canadian Infantry Brigade. Encountering stiff enemy resistance, [...] "C" [...] Company managed to secure their objective by executing a <b>hasty</b> flanking <b>attack.</b> For his actions during the attack, Sergeant Robert Pearcey was awarded the Military Medal.|$|R
2500|$|On 7 October, the 4th Army {{headquarters}} rescinded {{the policy}} of a reinforced front defence zone, to avoid another disaster like 4 October. Front line regiments were dispersed again, with their reserve battalions moved back behind the artillery protective line. More artillery was to be used against British artillery, to protect the Eingreifdivisionen as they advanced. The Eingreifdivisionen were placed closer to the front line, to intervene as swiftly as possible once an attack commenced, despite {{the risk of being}} devastated by the British artillery. On 9 October Ludendorff issued a memorandum to all Western Front divisions, complaining that Eingreifdivisionen were being misused. Dispersal, poorly timed attacks, disorganisation and poor co-ordination with the artillery, had led to high casualties. Ludendorff emphasised that the reserve units of ground holding divisions, should conduct <b>hasty</b> <b>attacks</b> (...) to push attackers out of their area. [...] units should not be used to reinforce ground-holding divisions for hasty counter-attacks but were to be used only for properly organised counter-attacks (...) [...] As far as possible the Eingreifdivisionen were to avoid casualties, unless lost ground was tactically important enough to recapture.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>hasty</b> Soviet <b>attacks</b> {{failed to}} throw the Germans back, but they forced the German advance to halt and {{compelled}} the German units to engage in combat {{at a time when}} their stocks of supplies were low. By 30 July, General Franz Halder at OKH noted in his diary, [...] "Sixth Army's striking power is paralyzed by ammunition and fuel supply difficulties." [...] During this phase, the Soviets fought at a disadvantage as the Luftwaffe dominated the air over the Kalach Bridgehead and repeatedly struck the 1st and 4th Tank Armies.|$|R
5000|$|FM 17-97, the United States Army field {{manual for}} Cavalry Troop operations, defines it as: [...] "A <b>hasty</b> <b>attack</b> is {{conducted}} {{with a minimum}} of preparation to defeat an enemy force that is not prepared or deployed to fight. It is a course of action routinely employed in cavalry operations to seize or retain the initiative, or to sustain the tempo of operations. A <b>hasty</b> <b>attack</b> can be executed while the troop is engaged with a zone reconnaissance mission or movement to contact." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hasty</b> <b>attack</b> is a {{specific}} form of attack identified within United States and Canadian military doctrine, in which upon contact with the enemy that is unprepared a unit decides to conduct an attack with limited planning and coordination and with rapid preparation and execution to exploit the enemy's weakness. Though applicable to infantry operations historically and in modern times, hasty attacks are a hallmark of mechanized force operations. During the Civil War, the command for a <b>hasty</b> <b>attack</b> was [...] "sally forth".|$|E
50|$|In a <b>hasty</b> <b>attack</b> often a {{fire support}} {{team will be}} {{positioned}} {{in such a way}} that allows it to oversee the battlefield to control the indirect fire. Any organic fire support, like mortar sections, will establish firing positions and prepare to suppress the enemy position.|$|E
50|$|From {{their new}} base at Fort Erie, Brown next marched up the Niagara River and met the British at the Battle of Chippawa. The British {{commander}} at Chippawa, Major General Phineas Riall, {{believed that the}} garrison of Fort Erie was still holding out, which contributed to his decision to launch a <b>hasty</b> and ill-fated <b>attack.</b>|$|R
50|$|Late in 1848, a large British and Bengal army {{took the}} field {{during the cold}} weather season under the Commander in Chief of the Bengal Army, General Sir Hugh Gough. Gough already had a reputation, whether {{deserved}} or not, for unimaginative head-on tactics. On 22 November at Ramnagar, his cavalry were repulsed attacking a Sikh bridgehead on the east bank of the Chenab. Then on 13 January 1849, he launched a <b>hasty</b> frontal <b>attack</b> against Sher Singh's army at Chillianwala near the Jhelum River and was driven back with heavy casualties. Several days' heavy rain followed, preventing either army from renewing the battle. After they had faced each other for three days, both withdrew.|$|R
50|$|Between 1-5 April, the 8th Jaeger Battalion was in {{the thick}} of the {{fighting}} both on the frontline and at headquarters. Tensions surfaced between Oesch and Elfvengren. There was much animosity between the German trained Jaeger officer and the Russian trained White commander which led to arrogance and scornful attitudes between the two men. Oesch felt that Elfvengren was too <b>hasty</b> in his <b>attacks</b> which lead to unnecessary losses and low morale. It was reported that Elfvengren was jealous of Oesch. As the relationship continued to deteriorate Sihvo himself eventually had to intercede. The ongoing dispute undoubtedly affected battlefield operations.|$|R
50|$|A {{textbook}} {{example of}} a <b>hasty</b> <b>attack</b> was the Battle of 73 Easting. There the cavalry troop commander Captain H. R. McMaster upon advancing into an Iraqi Armor Brigade assembly area ordered his unit to advance and engage the Iraqis, exploiting surprise and momentum to win a decisive victory over a much larger and heavily armed force.|$|E
50|$|The <b>hasty</b> <b>attack</b> {{stands in}} {{contrast}} to a deliberate attack, an offensive mission conducted to defeat enemy forces in prepared defensive positions or strongpoints, employing detailed tactical planning and rehearsal of the attack, or a raid which is an attack into enemy territory for a specific purpose, with no intent to gain or hold terrain, and where the unit returns to friendly lines after the attack.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} day, the Parliamentarian commanders held {{a council}} of war at Speen. Cromwell, Balfour and Sir Arthur Hesilrige eventually {{were allowed to}} take cavalry {{in pursuit of the}} King's army, but soon found that the Royalists had already crossed the River Thames at Wallingford and had reached the safety of the neighbourhood of Oxford. The Parliamentarians called off the pursuit and instead made a <b>hasty</b> <b>attack</b> on Donnington Castle. The attack was defeated with heavy casualties.|$|E

50|$|Witnessing Khukri sinking as she did, aggravated the {{commanding}} officer of her sister ship, Kirpan. Kirpan engaged Hangor with a <b>hasty</b> emergency <b>attack.</b> Sinking a pattern of depth charges, Kirpan hoped to drive Hangor into retreat. However, Hangor continued the engagement, firing a third torpedo locked on to Kirpans tail. Kirpan quickly disengaged, and increased her speed and successfully evaded the torpedo, though it is reported {{that it had been}} damaged in the attack. INS Kirpan later returned for rescue operations along with INS Katchal. Hangor disengaged by turning west towards deeper waters. Hangor continued to patrol for another 4 days till the night of 13 December 1971 when she returned safely to her berth. While celebrating her victory, {{the second half of the}} mission, Ghazi under the command of Commander Zafar Muhammad Khan patrolling in water near Visakhapatnam, Bay of Bengal, was given the task of laying mines close to the port, a task it was not originally meant for but was restructured in Turkey to include mine laying. While the Indian Navy claimed to have sunk Ghazi the Pakistanis claimed that during the process one mine exploded and the submarine sank. After the war, Indian divers located PNS Ghazi and reported a wide hole blown from inside out. All hands aboard Ghazi died when the submarine sank on the night of 4 December 1971.|$|R
50|$|Leading {{up to the}} <b>hasty</b> <b>attack,</b> the {{reconnaissance}} {{element in}} contact with the enemy will generally continue to reconnoiter the enemy's position and perform their tasks. Often one section will remain {{in contact with the}} enemy while another will continue its reconnaissance up to a limit of advance established by the commander. Both reconnaissance elements are looking for the presence of other enemy units, to the flanks or rear, supporting the objective enemy unit. Immediately prior to the attack the commander may choose to direct the battle from the position of the reconnaissance element in overwatch.|$|E

50|$|Starting on 17 March 1917, the 2nd Division was reorganised {{to pursue}} the German withdrawal, with the 6th Brigade chosen to lead the pursuit. On 20 March, the 6th Brigade {{attempted}} a <b>hasty</b> <b>attack</b> on the fortified village of Noreuil, which was beaten back with 331 casualties. However, the next attack on the fortified village of Lagnicourt on 26 March was successful, with the German counter-attack {{on the same day}} defeated by the Australians. Soon after, the 2nd Division was relieved by Australian 4th Division, which conducted a second attack on the fortified village of Noreuil, which was captured on 2 April. With the capture of Noreuil (Louverval and Doignies were also taken by the Australian 5th Division on 2 April), the I Anzac Corps was within striking distance of the main Hindenburg defences.|$|E
5000|$|On 26 September Gough sacked Brigadier-General W. A. Oswald, GOC of 73 Brigade, part of 24th Division, as it {{was moving}} up to the front. There is little {{evidence}} to support a later claim that he had [...] "broken down mentally"; rather, Gough was concerned that the brigade might not hold its position around Fosse 8 against German counterattacks. Although Gough later acquired {{a reputation as a}} ruthless sacker of officers, he seldom did so while they were in action, and his dislike of Indian Army officers and elderly [...] "dugouts" [...] (retired officers recalled to service - Oswald was both) may have played a role. A <b>hasty</b> <b>attack</b> by 64 Brigade (part of 21st Division) at 1:45 pm that day, after an excited message from a junior staff officer, is also witness to the fear of sacking under which brigadiers worked.|$|E
50|$|Both combatants on Lake Ontario were {{building}} progressively larger ships of war. Yeo laid down a frigate, {{to be named}} Prince Regent, and requested the Admiralty to promote Mulcaster {{to the rank of}} Post-Captain to command her. This was agreed. Before the ship was launched, in late 1813, Mulcaster commanded several vessels from the Lake Ontario flotilla which were escorting supply convoys up the Saint Lawrence River. He encountered the vessels of American General James Wilkinson's expedition against Montreal at French Creek and harassed the American encampments. When Wilkinson set off down the Saint Lawrence, Mulcaster hastened to Kingston with the news and then sailed in pursuit with armed schooners and gunboats, with a detachment of soldiers commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Wanton Morrison embarked. On 11 November Mulcaster's gunboats helped goad Wilkinson into a <b>hasty</b> <b>attack</b> against Morrison which led to the American defeat at the Battle of Crysler's Farm.|$|E
