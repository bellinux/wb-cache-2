50|$|The {{divisions}} in CPH had emerged in 1925, when the Communist International asked the leadership trio {{of the party}} to step down. David Wijnkoop, Willem van Ravesteyn and Jan Ceton had led the party since its foundation in 1909. The trio was accused of not fully <b>implementing</b> <b>decisions</b> given to the party by the International. After their demotion, the group would rally an oppositional tendency within the party. The group was able to gather strong support within the Rotterdam branch of the party, which was van Ravestyen's home turf. As a result, the entire Rotterdam organisation of CPH was expelled from the party. On May 22-24 other followers of van Ravesteyn and Wijnkoop were expelled.|$|E
50|$|BAT {{for a given}} {{industrial}} sector are described in BAT reference documents (BREFs) as defined in article 3(11) of the Industrial Emissions Directive. BREFs {{are the result of}} an exchange of information between European Union Member States, the industries concerned, non-governmental organisations promoting environmental protection and the European Commission pursuant to article 13 of the directive. This exchange of information is often called the Sevilla process because it is steered by the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies of the European Commissions' Joint Research Centre, which is based in Seville. The process is described in detail in Commission Implementing Decision 2012/119/EU. The most important chapter of the BREFs, the BAT conclusions, are published as <b>implementing</b> <b>decisions</b> of the European Commission in the Official Journal of the European Union.

5000|$|In November 2000, U.S. President Bill Clinton issued Executive Order 13175, which {{required}} federal departments and agencies {{to consult with}} Indian Tribal governments {{in the development of}} policies that would have Tribal implications. Tribal Implications are defined by the EPA as having [...] "substantial direct effects on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the federal government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the federal government and Indian tribes." [...] As a Federal agency of the U.S. government, the EPA was required to establish a set of standards for the consultation process. As its initial response, the agency developed a set of standards that would allow for meaningful communication and coordination between the agency and tribal officials prior to the agency taking actions or <b>implementing</b> <b>decisions</b> that may affect tribes. The standards also designated EPA consultation contacts to promote consistency and coordination of the consultation process, and established management oversight and reporting to ensure accountability and transparency.|$|E
5000|$|Internal {{stakeholders}} can {{be considered}} {{the first line of}} action when it comes to <b>implementing</b> <b>decisions</b> in a company, {{due to the fact that}} they have direct influence on its organizational resources. The classification of internal stakeholders can be divided into three categories: shareholders, managerial employees, and employees. Shareholders typically believe that they are the ones with the most power when it comes to influencing decision making because they own a part of the company, however, managerial and nonmanagerial employees should be given the same amount of credit because they are the ones in charge of applying the different politics that have been established at a managerial level to assure the success of company. While managers transmit the organizations goals, the nonmanagers are in charge of putting these goals into practice. The success of a company occurs when these three categories are given the same importance, and therefore, become synchronized to achieve the same goals.|$|E
50|$|A {{majority}} of the Court considered that s 14(1) of the Act obliged the Magistrates Court to impose serious restraints on a person's liberty {{whether or not that}} person had committed or was ever likely to commit a criminal offence. The provision authorised the executive to enlist the Magistrates Court in <b>implementing</b> <b>decisions</b> of the executive and that the manner in which that occurred was incompatible with the Magistrates Court's institutional integrity as an independent and impartial tribunal. French CJ held at 26 that the legislative power of a State does not extend to enacting a law which deprives a court of the State of one of its defining characteristics as a court or impairs one or more of those characteristics. The courts decision was based in part on their concern that the Act infringed common law freedoms for the individuals involved, but mostly on the prospect of a Parliament directing courts was inconsistent with the separation of powers under the Commonwealth Constitution which applied to the state Magistrates Court as a repository of federal judicial power under section 71 of the Constitution.|$|E
