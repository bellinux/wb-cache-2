5|$|As {{tensions}} rose, Lithuania {{asked the}} Allied Supreme Council to intervene, and it proposed two demarcation lines to prevent open hostilities, drawn in June and July 1919 (the second one {{was known as}} the Foch Line). However, Poland ignored both lines and advanced deeper into the Lithuanian-controlled territory. Faced with pressure from the Entente, Polish Chief of State Józef Piłsudski, who was significantly involved in planning of the coup, did not want open Polish–Lithuanian hostilities, which could led to much bloodshed and even greater tensions between Poland and Lithuania. Instead, since <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> were enough Polish sympathizers in Lithuania to stage a coup d'etat, he decided to plan one to topple the Lithuanian government.|$|E
5|$|Chrysippus {{also argued}} for the {{existence}} of fate based on divination, which <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> was good evidence for. It would not be possible for diviners to predict the future if the future itself was accidental. Omens and portents, he believed, are the natural symptoms of certain occurrences. There must be countless indications of the course of providence, for the most part unobserved, the meaning of only a few having become known to humanity. To those who argued that divination was superfluous as all events are foreordained, he replied that both divination and our behaviour under the warnings which it affords are included in the chain of causation.|$|E
5|$|The casting {{director}} Roshmi Banerjee suggested Nawazuddin Siddiqui {{for the role}} of Khan. Siddiqui, who had only had minor roles in Bollywood up to that time, was surprised {{that for the first time}} he would not have to portray a beggar. Saswata Chatterjee, another Bengali actor, was surprised as well when he was offered the role of the contract killer Bob Biswas. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> were suitable actors in Hindi film industry for the role. He said that Ghosh had known him since childhood and was impressed with his acting, so he wanted him as Bob Biswas.|$|E

25|$|During {{the first}} half of the 20th century, a {{widening}} gap had existed between the classes; Perón hoped to close it through the increase of wages and employment, making the nation more pluralistic and less reliant on foreign trade. Before taking office in 1946, President Perón took dramatic steps which he believed would result in a more economically independent Argentina, better insulated from events such as World War II. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> would be another international war. The reduced availability of imports and the war's beneficial effects on both the quantity and price of Argentine exports had combined to create a US$1.7billion cumulative surplus during those years.|$|E
25|$|Laurents {{was horrified}} {{when he saw}} the first rough cut of the film. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> were a few good scenes, and some good moments in bad scenes, but overall {{he thought it was a}} badly photographed jumbled mess lacking coherence. Both stars {{appeared}} to be playing themselves more often than their characters, and Streisand often used a grand accent that Laurents felt hurt her performance. Pollack admitted the film was not good, accepted full responsibility for its problems, and apologized for his behavior. The following day he retreated to the editing room to improve it as much as possible. Laurents felt the changes made it better but never as good as it could have been.|$|E

25|$|Initially, the {{government}} had no comment about the controversy. Only deputy Carlos Kunkel said that {{although he did not}} know Lázaro Báez, if he committed a crime {{he had to go to}} prison; however, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> was insufficient evidence. Governor of Santa Cruz province Daniel Peralta denied any connection to Báez, saying that public works in the province were financed by the national government since 2008 through Vialidad Nacional. Once a Kirchner supporter, Peralta had turned to Federal Peronism. He said that the national government had invested $770million in public works from 2007 to 2012, and that control of such finances was the purview of the SIGEN. Minister Julio de Vido considered the scandal an attempt to halt construction of the dams Néstor Kirchner and Jorge Cepernic Dams. Báez, in a news conference where he took no questions, considered it an attempt to defame Néstor Kirchner; he questioned Fariña and Elaskar's reliability and the authenticity of the documents shown on the program.|$|E
500|$|On 25 May, Warne asked Potter to {{send him}} one of the two dummy books she had in her {{possession}} in order to check the size of the plates before continuing with the printer's blocks. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> was [...] "too much bend" [...] about the dog's nose and the division between its legs was unclear. He kept the two plates back for Potter's inspection before sending them off to make the blocks. On 26 May, he received two more originals and the circular portrait of the cat for the cover. He thought the background of the colour illustration of Ribby and Duchess sitting at the table too light, but liked the pen-and-ink sketches. Potter struggled with the dog illustrations, and sent Warne a photograph of her canine model to prove the dog's ruff was as large as she had depicted it.|$|E
500|$|Ballo's {{father was}} {{critical}} of the statements made by Fosse about his daughter's history. He commented to Verdens Gang that the Church of Scientology was negatively impacting the reputation of his daughter and not respecting the privacy of her health history. He {{did not wish to}} comment regarding the nature of the investigation in France. Ballo's uncle Heljar Ballo explained that Kaja Ballo's family decided to come forward with information to the media about her suicide, due to a motivation to publicize information relating to the circumstances of her death. Heljar Ballo told Aftenposten that the family [...] "had confidence" [...] in the investigation by local law enforcement in France. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> was a connection between her death and Scientology. Kaja Ballo's father retained an attorney to investigate his daughter's death. In April 2008, Ballo's family was considering taking legal action against Scientology. Kaja Ballo was interred on April 11, 2008 at Grefsen Church in Oslo, and approximately 500 people were present at the funeral ceremony.|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} avoid {{suffering}} a heavy defeat that could eliminate them, Rose worked out that if they batted first and declared within the first seven balls of their batting innings, it would not matter if they lost, as their bowling strike rate could not suffer sufficiently {{for them to be}} knocked out. There was no rule against declaring in one-day cricket, but Rose was aware that his plan was controversial. He discussed it with his teammates and there was no significant opposition–Derek Taylor, the wicket-keeper did not like the idea, but was not vociferous in the discussion. Rose sought clarification from Donald Carr, the chairman of the Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB), who administered cricket in England. Carr told Rose that his plan was legal, but against the spirit of the laws, and that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> would be repercussions if they went ahead with the plan. Roy Kerslake, the Somerset chairman, was with the team in Worcester and though he had reservations, he told Rose that he would [...] "support the team whatever their decision".|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. It {{was named the}} third best episode of The Simpsons by Sarah Culp of The Quindecim, {{and one of the}} ten best episodes by Jim Schembri of The Age. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, praised the episode for being one of the best Lisa-centric episodes, and called Lisa's talk with Thomas Jefferson and her nightmare vision of politicians as pigs [...] "especially worthy of note." [...] Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave the episode a 4.5 rating and said {{it is one of the}} best episodes featuring Lisa, [...] "complete with poignant observations about politics." [...] He particularly enjoyed the appearance of Barbara Bush at the White House. The Austin American-Statesmans Steven Stein said this was the first episode of The Simpsons he saw. Even though he did not understand half of the pop culture references, by the end of the episode he was a [...] "Simpsons convert." [...] <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> was [...] "something exotic about an issue as serious as political corruption being dealt with in a cartoon and being interrupted by jokes about beer and, yes, doughnuts." ...|$|E
500|$|Filming {{started in}} February 2012. Hooper {{investigated}} filming the feature in 3D, and performed some camera tests {{before deciding to}} film it with traditional 2D methods. He stated [...] " [...] I slightly worry with 3D that some people will physically struggle with it. If you have {{a certain type of}} eyesight it can be more demanding than watching a normal movie." [...] Unlike other musical films, Les Misérables features the actors singing live on camera, rather than miming to backing vocals. Hooper told Los Angeles Times that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> was a [...] "slightly strange falseness" [...] when he saw musical films where the actors sang to recordings. The actors wore wireless earpieces on set so they could sing to accompanying piano music. Hooper believed this method allowed the actors to have emotional control over their songs: [...] "When Annie [...] is singing 'I Dreamed a Dream', if she needs to take a tenth of a second to have a thought before she sings it, or to have an emotion before she sings a line, she can take it." [...] The actors also performed their songs in recitative style, which Hooper likened to being immersed in a 3D film. Les Miserables was released in North America on 25 December 2012, and received eight Academy Award nominations including Best Picture.|$|E

500|$|Contemporary critics {{discuss a}} clear {{progression}} {{over the course}} of Salinger's published work, as evidenced by the increasingly negative reviews received by each of his three post-Catcher story collections. Ian Hamilton adheres to this view, arguing that while Salinger's early stories for the [...] "slicks" [...] boasted [...] "tight, energetic" [...] dialogue, they had also been formulaic and sentimental. It took the standards of The New Yorker editors, among them William Shawn, to refine his writing into the [...] "spare, teasingly mysterious, withheld" [...] qualities of [...] "A Perfect Day for Bananafish" [...] (1948), The Catcher in the Rye, and his stories of the early 1950s. By the late 1950s, as Salinger became more reclusive and involved in religious study, Hamilton notes that his stories became longer, less plot-driven, and increasingly filled with digression and parenthetical remarks. Louis Menand agrees, writing in The New Yorker that Salinger [...] "stopped writing stories, in the conventional sense... He seemed to lose interest in fiction as an art form—perhaps <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> was something manipulative or inauthentic about literary device and authorial control." [...] In recent years, some critics have defended certain post-Nine Stories works by Salinger; in 2001, Janet Malcolm wrote in The New York Review of Books that [...] "Zooey" [...] "is arguably Salinger's masterpiece... Rereading it and its companion piece [...] "Franny" [...] is no less rewarding than rereading The Great Gatsby." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Chinese Restaurant" [...] {{was written}} by series co-creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones, who directed all of season two's episodes. David {{came up with the}} idea of the real-time episode while he and Seinfeld were waiting for a table at a Chinese restaurant in Los Angeles. When David presented the episode to NBC executives, he received a negative reaction. The network felt that there was no real story and viewers would not be interested. Executive Warren Littlefield commented that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> were pages missing from the script he had received. David argued that each character had a storyline: Jerry's story was he recognized a woman but did not know from where; Elaine's story was that she was very hungry; and George's story was that he was unable to use the phone. NBC disagreed and objected to the broadcast of the episode. To satisfy the executives, staff writer Larry Charles suggested the group's storyline to be on their way to a one-night screening of Plan 9 from Outer Space, and thus introducing a [...] "ticking clock" [...] scenario to the story. When the NBC executives still objected, David threatened to quit the show if the network would force any major changes upon the script. Seinfeld supported David and NBC eventually allowed them to produce [...] "The Chinese Restaurant" [...] without any significant alterations, although they strongly advised them not go through with it, and postponed the broadcast until near the end of the season. In 2015, Seinfeld writer Spike Feresten revealed that the host's calling [...] "Cartwright" [...] instead of [...] "Costanza" [...] was a subtle allusion to the classic western show Bonanza. [...] "Bonanza" [...] rhymes with [...] "Costanza" [...] and the show's main characters are the [...] "Cartwright" [...] family.|$|E
500|$|H. J. R. Murray {{wrote that}} Staunton's {{response}} to Morphy's initial challenge and his {{article about the}} same in The Illustrated London News should have been interpreted as a courteous refusal of the offer, but that Morphy interpreted them differently, {{and one of the}} main reasons for his visit to Europe in 1858 was the hope of playing a match with Staunton. Murray also commented on the whole affair, [...] "In all this there is but little in which we can reproach Staunton, beyond the fact that he kept open the possibility of a match for so long, and even here there is a good deal that could be urged in justification of the course followed by Staunton" [...] but also noted that both sides were playing tactical games with each other in front of the public, and that comments made by both players or their respective supporters were acrimonious. In response to Morphy's complaints Lord Lyttelton, then president of the British Chess Association, said that it was reasonable for Staunton to decline the match, but that in his opinion Staunton should have done so plainly in his first letter to America, but had instead often given the impression that he would soon be ready to start the match. von der Lasa later wrote, although not specifically about this affair, that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> was no chance of Staunton's health being good enough for a serious contest from 1853 onwards. William Norwood Potter wrote in his obituary of Staunton in the City of London Chess Magazine, [...] "...nor were his innuendoes concerning Morphy otherwise than an utterly unworthy means of getting out of an engagement, which he could have either declined with a good grace at first, or afterwards have honourably asked to be released from. Nevertheless, all said and done, Staunton was, as we have often heard a distinguished enemy of his say, emphatically a MAN. There was nothing weak about him, and he had a backbone that never curved with fear of any one." ...|$|E

Bonhoeffer called these two sayings [...] "the claim to exclusiveness and the claim to totality". [...] He argued that both are {{necessary}} and that [...] "The cross of Christ makes both sayings true." [...] D.A. Carson commented similarly, adding <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> are two different contexts where /describe the attitude listeners are to have to other possible disciples: when in doubt, be inclusive, while /describe the standard listeners should apply to themselves: be in no doubt of one's own standing.

2500|$|On June 5, 1989, Jackson barehanded a line-drive off {{the left}} field wall on a {{hit-and-run}} play against the Seattle Mariners.

But Jackson, from the warning track, turned flat footed and fired a strike on the fly to catcher Bob Boone, who tagged out the sliding Reynolds. Jackson's throw reached Boone on the fly. Interviewed for the [...] "Bo Jackson" [...] episode of ESPN Classic's SportsCentury, Reynolds admitted that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>there</b> was no way anyone would throw him out on such a deep drive into the gap in left-center, and {{was shocked to see}} his teammate telling him to slide as he rounded third base.|$|E
