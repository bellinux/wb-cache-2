40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} project is to improve {{industrial}} system testing efficiency. The thesis is mainly focused {{on the field of}} telecommunication. Testing {{is one of the most}} important steps before selling a product to customers and testing is also an important component of after sale maintenance. The work load for testers can be decreased and more projects could be carried out in parallel, if the testing efficiency can be improved. The thesis project is carried out within the Ericsson Product Development Unit (PDU) <b>Packet</b> <b>Core</b> System Test section. The goal is to improve the system testing efficiency of the <b>Evolved</b> <b>Packet</b> Gateway, as system testing has gradually become one of the bottle necks for the whole product release. Ericsson wants to accelerate its pace in releasing new products to the market and releasing new software to their customers. An initial investigation was made to get a clear view about how the complete system testing procedure is currently carried out and then, an analysis was made based on this information. Ideas were collected for a proposed new implementation and finally a prototype for the most useful ideas was developed and evaluated to show how the system testing efficiency can be improved. Finally, these ideas were proved to be valuable for Ericsson PDU <b>Packet</b> <b>Core</b> System Test section and two of them have been adopted and are already under developing...|$|R

40|$|Today's {{telecommunication}} {{world is}} developing toward an increasing demand for accessing the Internet, multimedia applications and IP technologies. As radio access technology evolves, {{the complexity of}} the core network increases and the need for intelligent verification procedures rises. The Gateway GPRS Support Node is an essential component of GPRS <b>packet</b> <b>core</b> network which acts as the gateway between the <b>packet</b> <b>core</b> and the external network.

30|$|In {{the last}} three years, several {{researchers}} have attempted to adapt SDN technology throughout mobile network architectures, from the radio access network to the mobile <b>packet</b> <b>core</b> network. Since the mobile <b>packet</b> <b>core</b> network is composed of wired entities (e.g., SGW, PGW, etc.), it seems that these {{would be easier to}} re‐design by leveraging SDN technology rather than redesigning the radio access part. To this end, most studies have attempted to centralize control functions, including the control function of the MME {{as well as those of}} the SGW and PGW, as packages in an SDN controller or as VMs running in a cloud environment. The data plane for the EPC entities is simplified and can be thus programmed from the control plane by using open interfaces.|$|R
30|$|To provide QoS and satisfy {{bandwidth}} {{requirements of the}} mobile communications, the mobile <b>packet</b> <b>core</b> network and the backhaul must implement a control plane which handles and tracks the mobility of the mobile node (MN) and also maintains the active services when the handover is produced.|$|R
30|$|To {{support this}} integration, an IP-based {{backhaul}} is {{deployed in the}} mobile network, and it is integrated with the <b>packet</b> <b>core</b> network.

50|$|The LTE {{specification}} provides downlink peak {{rates of}} 300 Mbit/s, uplink peak rates of 75 Mbit/s and QoS provisions permitting a transfer latency {{of less than}} 5 ms in the radio access network.

LTE supports scalable carrier bandwidths, from 1.4 MHz to 20 MHz and supports both frequency division duplexing (FDD) and time-division duplexing (TDD). The IP-based network architecture, called the <b>Evolved</b> <b>Packet</b> <b>Core</b> (EPC) designed to replace the GPRS Core Network, supports seamless handovers for both voice and data to cell towers with older network technology such as GSM, UMTS and CDMA2000.

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} improve the {{efficiency}} of maintaining <b>packet</b> <b>core</b> network and test the network elements, a simulation testing system for GPRS and UMTS 3 G <b>packet</b> <b>core</b> network is proposed. The system can simultaneously simulate several network elements to connect with SGSN, GGSN, WAP gateway respectively for testing. In the system, multiple UEs can be simulated, and multiple applications can run on each UE. Protocol Stack Pool is developed to accommodate several protocol stacks at Gb, Iu-PS, Gn, Gi interfaces. Simulated UEs can communicate with the network side equipments through the Protocol Stack Pool. The system was implemented in Linux operating system and a web-based management subsystem was provided. The system was tested by Tektronix K 1297 testing equipment and by accessing the current cellular mobile communications network. We also emulate the main network elements and set up an emulated core network to test in laboratory. The testing results show that applications can run on the system to test the network elements...|$|R
