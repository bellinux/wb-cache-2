40|$|This paper {{provides}} a new reading of a classical economic relation: the short-run Phillips curve. Our point is that, {{when dealing with}} inflation and unemployment, policy making {{can be understood as}} a multicriteria decision making (MCDM) problem. Hence, we use so-called multiobjective programming in connection with a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to determine the combinations of policy instruments that provide efficient combinations of inflation and unemployment. This approach results in an alternative version of the Phillips curve labelled as efficient Phillips curve. Our aim is to present an application of CGE models to a new area of research that can be especially useful when addressing policy exercises with real data. We apply our methodological proposal within a particular regional economy, Andalusia, in the South of Spain. This tool can give some keys for policy advice and policy implementation in the <b>fight</b> <b>against</b> unemployment and <b>inflation.</b> JRC.

40|$|Purpose – The paper aims {{to assess}} the impact of {{agricultural}} output changes on the general price level over time with China as an example. Design/methodology/approach – A simple numerical global general equilibrium (GE) model of two regions (China and the rest of the world) and three commodities (agriculture, manufacturing goods, and services) is used {{to assess the}} impacts of agricultural output changes on the overall economy price changes. The numerical GE model of this paper consists of production, final consumption, and market clear conditions. The results are generated with the GE model calibrated to aggregated China's input-output tables of 1987, 1997, and 2005. Findings – The results suggest that China witnessed a declining influence of agricultural output changes on general price changes. The contribution of given agricultural output change on the general price change in 2005 was merely less than 60 percent of that in 1987, which in turn implies that macro policies targeting to curb general inflation via boosting agricultural output will be less effective as those of 20 years ago. Practical implications – China's policy makers should rely less and less on promoting agricultural output policies to <b>fight</b> <b>against</b> general <b>inflation</b> and should resort to non-agricultural policies. Originality/value – The paper argues that the influence of agriculture on the China's general price indices has been weakening along with China's economic development with a numerical GE model calibrated to aggregated China's input-output tables of 1987, 1997, and 2005.

40|$|Abstract Purpose of the {{research}} is to get evidence how returns on assets are related <b>against</b> <b>inflation.</b> In other words, idea {{is to find out}} if some assets can offer hedge <b>against</b> <b>inflation.</b> More specifically, aim of the study is to get global evidence of hedging ability of assets <b>against</b> <b>inflation</b> in the long run. Moreover, this research presents findings how assets are related with inflation in different time periods. Additionally, this study shows how returns on assets react <b>against</b> <b>inflation</b> shocks. First of all, this study points out how nominal and real returns differ from each other between different asset classes. Then, autocorrelation is tested for nominal and real returns. Existence of unit-roots is tested by using ADF-, PP- and KPSS-test. Basic OLS estimation is used to get evidence how returns on assets are related <b>against</b> <b>inflation.</b> More deeply, ARIMA model shows how returns on assets are related against expected and unexpected inflation. Quantile regression presents how returns on assets behave <b>against</b> <b>inflation</b> in different quantiles. Finally, VAR analysis is used to get information of Granger causality, impulse-response function and cointegration. The results show clearly that Goldman Sachs Commodity Index offers the best hedge <b>against</b> <b>inflation.</b> In fact, Goldman Sachs Commodity Index offers hedge against both, expected and unexpected inflation in the long run. However, quantile regression and periodic analysis show that even Goldman Sachs Commodity Index cannot offer hedge <b>against</b> <b>inflation</b> during extremely high inflation periods. On the other hand, gold seems to offer at least partial hedge <b>against</b> <b>inflation</b> during high inflation periods. REITs can offer partial hedge <b>against</b> <b>inflation,</b> but the hedge does not hold when the rate of inflation is high. Interestingly, stocks cannot offer hedge <b>against</b> <b>inflation</b> in the long run. However, in the case when the rate of inflation is low, stocks seems to offer at least partial hedge <b>against</b> <b>inflation.</b> Interest rates are positively related with inflation, but cannot offer any hedge against it. Finally, bonds are the worst assets <b>against</b> <b>inflation,</b> but U. S TIPS can offer some hedge. Generally speaking, these results show clearly that when investment decisions are done between different asset classes, the rate of inflation should be taken into consideration with high importance. More specifically, the rate of inflation can be extremely harmful for the returns on assets. Finally, {{it should be noted that}} the results show that different asset classes react completely differently <b>against</b> <b>inflation...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the short-run and long-run inflation hedging effectiveness {{of gold in}} the United States and Japan {{during the period of}} January 1971 to January 2010. Previous research has shown in the long-run that inflation tends to appropriately increase the price of gold in the U. S., leading to gold's popularity as an asset in portfolios to reduce the risk <b>against</b> sudden <b>inflation.</b> However, gold is only partially effective in hedging <b>against</b> <b>inflation</b> in Japan. This research found that the rigidity between the price of gold and the consumer price index affects the inflation hedging ability of gold in the long-run. The gold price is characterized by market disequilibrium induced by the price rigidity, causing the price of gold to be unable to response to changes in the CPI. To explore the inflation hedging ability of gold in the short-run, this study further examines the price rigidity in low and high momentum regime. It is found during the low momentum regimes that, gold return is unable to hedge <b>against</b> <b>inflation</b> in either the U. S. or Japan. However, during high momentum regimes, gold return is able to hedge <b>against</b> <b>inflation</b> in the U.
