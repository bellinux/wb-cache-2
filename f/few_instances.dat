5|$|Although not {{required}} by law or military regulation, members of the uniformed services are encouraged to render salutes to recipients of the Medal of Honor {{as a matter of}} respect and courtesy regardless of rank or status, {{whether or not they are}} in uniform. This is one of the <b>few</b> <b>instances</b> where a living member of the military will receive salutes from members of a higher rank.|$|E

There is no loss of generality arising from this fact since the learning process converges, in respect to the indicators being measured, before those samples are exhausted.|$|R
5|$|By 1942, {{there were}} {{proposals}} for completely buried flame fougasses {{to be used}} as oil mines but by then the emergency was over. Almost all flame fougasses were removed {{before the end of the}} war and in most instances even the slightest traces of their original locations have disappeared. A <b>few</b> <b>instances</b> were missed, and their remains have been found. For example, the rusty remnants of a four-barrel battery, one of which still contained an oily residue, were discovered in 2010 in West Sussex.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Infantry Division {{then moved}} to the offensive, in early May 1951 {{they were used to}} scout for Chinese {{concentrations}} and then call in artillery to destroy them. These actions have been viewed by historians as one of <b>few</b> <b>instances</b> where Rangers in Korea were effectively employed, used as a stealthy infiltration force for terrain too difficult for conventional units.|$|E
5|$|The Third Amendment {{has been}} invoked in a <b>few</b> <b>instances</b> as helping {{establish}} an implicit {{right to privacy}} in the Constitution. Justice William O. Douglas used the amendment along {{with others in the}} Bill of Rights as a partial basis for the majority decision in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), which cited the Third Amendment as implying a belief that an individual's home should be free from agents of the state.|$|E
40|$|Hampson, Goldberg and John (1987) {{reported}} {{a positive correlation}} between category breadth and social desirability of trait descriptive adjectives. Two possible explanations for this finding are as follows. (a) Undesirable traits represent denials of desirable traits, and are thus more difficult to process cognitively; therefore, <b>fewer</b> <b>instances</b> of negative traits can be imagined. (b) Undesirable behaviours are less frequent; therefore, <b>fewer</b> <b>instances</b> spring to mind. With respect to root/negation pairs of traits in which the negation is socially desirable (e. g. Unenvious/Envious), Hypothesis (a) predicts a lower category breadth for the negation, whereas Hypothesis (b) predicts the reverse. Using the relevant trait pairs in Table 1 from Hampson et al. (1987), Hypothesis (b) appeared to be victorious in 10 of the 12 cases (p < 0. 05) ...|$|R

Paucal number has also been documented in some Cushitic languages of Ethiopia, including Baiso, which marks singular, paucal, plural. When paucal number is used in Arabic, it generally refers to ten or <b>fewer</b> <b>instances.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{cattle egret}} engages in {{low levels of}} brood parasitism, {{and there are a}} <b>few</b> <b>instances</b> of cattle egret eggs being laid in the nests of snowy egrets and little blue herons, {{although}} these eggs seldom hatch. There is also evidence of low levels of intraspecific brood parasitism, with females laying eggs in the nests of other cattle egrets. As much as 30% extra-pair copulations have been noted.|$|E
5|$|Violent crime, {{including}} murder, {{has occurred}} on the trail in a <b>few</b> <b>instances.</b> Most have been crimes by non-hikers who crossed paths relatively randomly with the AT hiker-victims. The official website of the Appalachian Trail Conservancy {{points out that the}} number of violent crimes is extremely low when compared against the number of people (3 to 4 million) who hike on the trail every year.|$|E
5|$|Female {{homosexuality}} has {{not received}} the same negative response from religious or criminal authorities as male homosexuality or adultery has throughout history. Whereas sodomy between men, men and women, and men and animals was punishable by death in Britain, acknowledgment of sexual contact between women was nonexistent in medical and legal texts. The earliest law against female homosexuality appeared in France in 1270. In Spain, Italy, and the Holy Roman Empire, sodomy between women was included in acts considered unnatural and punishable by burning to death, although <b>few</b> <b>instances</b> are recorded of this taking place.|$|E
30|$|Case C {{represents}} a library {{that is not}} accessed much—in average, each object is used only every 10  years. If so, then there are comparatively <b>fewer</b> <b>instances</b> when mechanical degradation can accumulate, and as a consequence, even degraded objects do not become unfit and only ~ 10  % of acidic paper will reach the fitness threshold, {{with the rest of}} the collection remaining fit for use.|$|R

In addition, CTM participants report a higher overall feeling of control {{as compared to}} those using Standard Shared Mode...|$|R
50|$|Some princesses are reigning monarchs of principalities. There {{have been}} <b>fewer</b> <b>instances</b> of reigning princesses than reigning princes, as most principalities {{excluded}} women from inheriting the throne. Examples of princesses regnant have included Constance of Antioch, princess regnant of Antioch in the 12th century. As the President of France, an office for which women are eligible, is ex-officio co-Prince of Andorra, Andorra could theoretically be {{ruled by a}} co-Princess.|$|R
5|$|The {{idea of a}} sonic {{weapon was}} one which had been unsuccessfully pioneered by German {{scientists}} {{under the control of}} Albert Speer during World War II. A book that Tintin examines in Professor Topolino's house, German Research in World War II by Leslie E. Simon– a retired Major General in the US Army– really existed and was published in 1947. In the strip, Hergé preserved the English language title of the book rather than translating it into French, although altered the book's cover design to remove a prominent swastika. The inclusion of the book is one of the <b>few</b> <b>instances</b> that there is any reference to the Second World War within The Adventures of Tintin.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a <b>few</b> <b>instances</b> of fishers preying on cats and small dogs; in Massachusetts |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517202212/http://www.mass.gov/dfwele/dfw/wildlife/living/living_with_fisher.htm |archivedate=May 17, 2008 |accessdate=August 21, 2016}} but in general, the {{evidence}} suggests these attacks are rare. A 1979 study examined the stomach contents of all fishers trapped {{in the state of}} New Hampshire; cat hairs were found in only 1 of over 1,000 stomachs. More recent studies in suburban upstate New York and Massachusetts found no cat remains in 24 and 226 fisher diet samples (scat and stomach contents) respectively. While there is popular belief for more frequent attacks on pets, zoologists suggest bobcats or coyotes are more likely to prey upon domestic cats and chickens.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a <b>few</b> <b>instances</b> of general {{population}} poisoning {{as the result of}} long-term exposure to cadmium in contaminated food and water, and research into an estrogen mimicry that may induce breast cancer is ongoing. In the decades leading up to World War II, mining operations contaminated the Jinzū River in Japan with cadmium and traces of other toxic metals. As a consequence, cadmium accumulated in the rice crops along the riverbanks downstream of the mines. Some members of the local agricultural communities consumed the contaminated rice and developed itai-itai disease and renal abnormalities, including proteinuria and glucosuria.|$|E

In {{the latter}} ones, {{a higher number}} of transitively valid {{relation}} (due to {{the totality of the}} graph) means <b>fewer</b> <b>instances</b> of the verify_high rule are applied. For the case of distrust costs, Lemma 3 states that, given a fixed number of lazy agents, the value of distrust instances is only due to the applications of the unverified_contra rule. The explanation above, mapping order relation to topologies, holds in this latter case as well.|$|R

5|$|Unlike the Robinson Crusoe of the novel, who craved human contact, {{most of the}} Warsaw Crusoes {{tried to}} avoid it at all cost. This contradiction was noted by both the Robinsons and those who wrote about them after the war. Being {{discovered}} by the Germans in almost all cases meant immediate death. There were, however, some exceptions, the best known being that of Szpilman's encounter with Wilm Hosenfeld, a captain of the Wehrmacht who helped to hide and feed him. In a <b>few</b> <b>instances</b> those captured were first forced to help the Germans with the looting of the city's ruins, before being either executed or sent to the Pruszków camp.|$|E
5|$|As {{a clandestine}} army {{operating}} in an enemy-occupied country, and separated by {{over a thousand}} kilometers from any friendly territory, the Home Army faced unique challenges in acquiring arms and equipment. It was able to overcome these difficulties to some extent and to field {{tens of thousands of}} armed soldiers. Nevertheless, the difficult conditions meant that only infantry forces armed with light weapons could be fielded. Any use of artillery, armor or aircraft was impossible (except for a <b>few</b> <b>instances</b> during the Warsaw Uprising, such as the Kubuś armored car). Even these light-infantry units were as a rule armed with a mixture of weapons of various types, usually in quantities sufficient to arm only a fraction of a unit's soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The narrator's tone is {{informal}} and conversational, attempting to conjure {{the picture of}} a dialogue between the reader and the speaker (who is evidently Auden himself, speaking directly in the first person as he does in a large proportion of his work). The informality is established syntactically by enjambment—only 13 of the poem's 93 lines are clearly end-stopped. There are <b>few</b> <b>instances</b> of rhyme, and about half the lines end on unaccented syllables. The lines alternate 13 syllables incorporating five or six accents with 11 syllables and four accents. Auden adapted this syllabic construction from Marianne Moore. The pattern is reinforced by the line indentation and confirmed by Auden's own reading. This structure mitigates the tendency of normally accented English speech to fall into the rhythm of iambic pentameter. Swift changes in the sophistication of diction also occur in the poem, as in conversation, and lend it an immediate, informal quality.|$|E
5000|$|In 1997, the U.S. Army mounted an {{exercise}} codenamed [...] "Force 21", {{to test the}} application of digital technologies in warfare {{in order to improve}} communications and logistics by applying private-sector technologies adapted for military use. Specifically, it sought to increase awareness of one's position on the battlefield as well as the enemy's, in order to achieve increased lethality for enemies, greater control of the tempo of warfare, and <b>fewer</b> <b>instances</b> of friendly fire via improved identification friend or foe.|$|R
50|$|According to experts, {{many women}} become victims of trafficking, {{the most common}} form of which is prostitution, as a means of {{survival}} and economic desperation. Deterioration of living conditions can often compel children to abandon school to contribute to the family income, putting them at risk of being exploited. For example, in Zimbabwe, a number of girls are turning to sex in return for food to survive because of the increasing poverty. According to studies, as poverty decreases there will be <b>fewer</b> and <b>fewer</b> <b>instances</b> of violence.|$|R

5|$|The {{sequence}} of earthquakes caused widespread landslides {{from the coast}} to east of Scotia and from the northern extent of the Eel River basin near Thompson Hill to south of Petrolia. Most of these were existing landslides that had been re-initiated and {{the largest of the}} slides were either slumps or bedding plane failures along the coastal bluffs. Several slump failures between Guthrie Creek and Oil Creek stretched from the bluffs out towards the shore for a distance of , leaving some of the slide to be eroded by the surf. The road between Ferndale and Petrolia was closed {{for more than a week}} where about six mostly minor landslides blocked the passage, with the roadway itself sustaining light damage due to sliding or settlement of the road fill in a <b>few</b> <b>instances.</b> One of the largest slides occurred along the railroad tracks at the Scotia bluffs where previous slides had taken place. That slide also took about a week to clear.|$|E
5|$|The {{war between}} the two sides in England reached a {{stalemate}} in the mid-1140s, while Geoffrey of Anjou consolidated his hold on power in Normandy. 1143 started precariously for Stephen when he was besieged by Robert of Gloucester at Wilton Castle, an assembly point for royal forces in Herefordshire. Stephen attempted to break out and escape, resulting in the battle of Wilton. Once again, the Angevin cavalry proved too strong, and for a moment it appeared that Stephen might be captured for a second time. On this occasion, however, William Martel, Stephen's steward, made a fierce rear guard effort, allowing Stephen to escape from the battlefield. Stephen valued William's loyalty sufficiently to agree to exchange Sherborne Castle for his safe release—this was one of the <b>few</b> <b>instances</b> where Stephen was prepared to give up a castle to ransom one of his men.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian {{may have}} become {{involved}} in battles against the Quadi and Marcomanni immediately after the Battle of the Margus. He eventually {{made his way to}} northern Italy and made an imperial government, but it is not known whether he visited the city of Rome at this time. There is a contemporary issue of coins suggestive of an imperial adventus (arrival) for the city, but some modern historians state that Diocletian avoided the city, and that he did so on principle, as the city and its Senate were no longer politically relevant to the affairs of the empire and needed to be taught as much. Diocletian dated his reign from his elevation by the army, not the date of his ratification by the Senate, following the practice established by Carus, who had declared the Senate's ratification a useless formality. However, Diocletian was to offer proof of his deference towards the Senate by retaining Aristobulus as ordinary consul and colleague for 285 (one of the <b>few</b> <b>instances</b> during the Late Empire in which an emperor admitted a privatus as his colleague) and by creating senior senators Vettius Aqulinus and Junius Maximus ordinary consuls for the following year – for Maximus, it was his second consulship.|$|E
