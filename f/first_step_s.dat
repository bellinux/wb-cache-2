In the second step, the Mg++ concentration was raised to 20 mM and the incubation was performed for 90 min at 50 °. No requirement for 30 S subunits or other components (e. g., polyamine) was found. The reconstituted particle has the same sedimentation coefficient as the native 50 S subunit and is highly active in protein synthesis with natural (R 17 RNA) and artificial [poly(U) ] messengers as well as in tests for peptidyltransferase (fragment assay) and for binding of antibiotics (chloramphenicol) ...|$|R

The emergence of chloroquine-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum in most of the malarious areas has encountered the relevant countries with some difficulties about treating the acute cases of the disease particulary if the monotherapy regimen has been used. Because of many advantages for the combination therapy, the effectiveness of chloroquine (CQ) and Otostegia persica (OP), a medicinal plant in combination form, was tested against the chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant strains of Plasmodium berghei in sourian mouse using in-vivo adapted fixed ratios method in this study.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has evidenced {{a relationship between}} Fe nutrition and S nutrition. Aim of the present work {{was to investigate the}} effect of Fe deficiency on the capacity of maize roots to take up and metabolize S. Maize (Zea mays L. cv. Cecilia) plants were grown for 10 d in nutrient solution (NS) with (+S) or without (-S) sulphate and Fe was added as Fe-III-EDTA at 80 mum. After removing the extraplasmatic Fe pool, half of the plants of each treatment (+S and -S) were transferred to a new Fe-free NS. Roots were collected 4 and 24 h from the beginning of Fe deprivation. Fe deprivation slightly increased root thiols content in both nutritive conditions (+S and -S). ATP sulphurylase activity was enhanced by sulphur deprivation, but greatly depressed when Fe and S were both omitted from the nutrient solution. O-Acetylserine sulphydrylase activity was also enhanced by S deprivation; this activity was increased by Fe starvation in +S plants, while it was unaffected by Fe nutrition in -S plants. S deprivation greatly increased uptake rates of (SO 42 -) -S- 35 (1. 9 +/- 0. 1 vs. 5. 2 +/- 0. 2 mumol g(- 1) root d. w. h(- 1)); furthermore, Fe deficiency increased (SO 42 -) -S- 35 uptake rates by 11 and 55 % in +S and -S plants, respectively. Data show that Fe-deficiency in maize results in a higher ability to take up sulphate, while limiting the <b>first</b> <b>step</b> of <b>S</b> assimilation in S deprived plants...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was the {{evaluation}} of lime pretreatment combined or not with previous step of autohydrolysis for oat straw valorization. Under selected conditions of lime pretreatment, 96 % of glucan and 77 % of xylan were recovered and 42 % of delignification was achieved. Xylose fermentation to ethanol by metabolic engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae (MEC 1133) strain improved the ethanol production by 22 % achieving 41 g/L. Alternatively, <b>first</b> <b>step</b> of autohydrolysis (<b>S</b> 0 = 4. 22) allowed a high oligosaccharides recovery (68 %) and subsequent lime pretreatment attained a 57 % of delignification and 99 % of glucan to glucose conversion. Oat straw processed by autohydrolysis and lime pretreatment reached the maximal ethanol concentration (50 g/L). Both strategies led to oat straw valorization into bioethanol, oligosaccharides and lignin indicating that these pretreatments are adequate as a first stage within an oat straw biorefinery.

40|$|This paper {{shows how}} to {{construct}} locally robust semiparametric GMM estimators, meaning equivalently moment conditions have zero derivative {{with respect to}} the <b>first</b> <b>step</b> and the <b>first</b> <b>step</b> does not affect the asymptotic variance. They are constructed by adding to the moment functions the adjustment term for <b>first</b> <b>step</b> estimation. Locally robust estimators have several advantages. They are vital for valid inference with machine learning in the <b>first</b> <b>step,</b> see Belloni et. al. (2012, 2014), and are less sensitive to the specification of the <b>first</b> <b>step.</b> They are doubly robust for affine moment functions, so moment conditions continue to hold when one <b>first</b> <b>step</b> component is incorrect. Locally robust moment conditions also have smaller bias that is flatter as a function of <b>first</b> <b>step</b> smoothing leading to improved small sample properties. Series <b>first</b> <b>step</b> estimators confer local robustness on any moment conditions and are doubly robust for affine moments, {{in the direction of the}} series approximation. Many new locally and doubly robust estimators are given here, including for economic structural models.
