25|$|The {{concert was}} {{scheduled}} to take place at a venue called The <b>Empty</b> <b>Bottle</b> on 13 December 2003, with Der Blutharsch and Changes. Initially, pressure from a group calling themselves the Center for New Community {{was applied to the}} owner of the club, Bruce Finkelman. Finkelman, who is Jewish, and his staff, which contains African Americans, initially decided the show would go on, feeling there was insufficient evidence to cancel the performance.|$|E
25|$|The record {{discloses}} {{that although}} the propanone was difficult to obtain, it {{was by no means}} impossible. The defendants admitted making the drug both before and after those batches made with the propanone supplied by Shapiro. Shapiro testified that he saw an <b>empty</b> <b>bottle</b> labeled phenyl-2-propanone on his first visit to the laboratory on December 7, 1969. And when the laboratory was searched pursuant to a search warrant on January 10, 1970, two additional bottles labeled phenyl-2-propanone were seized. Thus, the facts in the record amply demonstrate that the propanone used in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine not only could have been obtained without the intervention of Shapiro but was in fact obtained by these defendants.|$|E
25|$|Poirot and {{the police}} {{question}} the suspects and examine alibis. Kenneth was heard typing letters specifically responding to figures in previous mail. Linda falsely claims she was fond of her stepmother. By her watch, she and Christine went to Gull Cove at 10:30 and returned at 11:45, giving them an alibi. The Gardeners were with Poirot the entire time. Rosamund was seen reading at Sunny Ledge (above Pixy Cove) by Emily and Patrick. Rev. Lane and Major Barry were absent the whole day and Sir Horace Blatt went sailing. Christine, Rosamund, Kenneth and Mr Gardener all went to play tennis at noon. Earlier in the day, Miss Brewster was nearly hit on the head by an <b>empty</b> <b>bottle</b> tossed {{from one of the}} bedroom windows, so Poirot asks the chambermaid if she has observed a bottle missing. The chambermaid cannot tell, but did note another odd occurrence: somebody ran a bath at noon but everyone denies having done so.|$|E

25|$|Jandek {{performed}} {{twice in}} September 2006. The first show, in Toronto, was performed at Centre of Gravity, a renovated Vaudeville theatre/circus rehearsal space and continued the semi-classical/jazzy aspects of Glasgow Monday, this time using a unique lineup of cymbals, double bass and a guitar played more for sound patterns than melody. The artist himself played the Korg keyboards again (as {{he had in}} Manhattan), and the performance was one extended piece. By contrast, three days later he played a high-amped rock set at the <b>Empty</b> <b>Bottle</b> in Chicago with bassist Josh Abrams and Tortoise drummer/producer John McEntire that featured lyrics recounting a prison stay. Jandek played a show in Seattle, Washington at On the Boards on October 27, 2006 with the same lineup as the Portland performance earlier that year, and he ended 2006 with a concert in Indianapolis on December 9, 2006 in a church sanctuary attached to the Harrison Center for the Arts. That show included Nathan Vollmar of the band Rivulets on drums, and a female vocalist who also played viola and sang lead on a few tracks and a flute player, a first.|$|E

2500|$|The {{airport was}} owned by Infratil, a New Zealand company and {{majority}} owner of Wellington International Airport Infratil also owned Manston Airport until November 2013. Manston was sold to a shell company owned by Ann Gloag, a co-founder of Stagecoach, Prestwick's previous owner. In April 2005, Infratil completed a major refurbishment of the terminal building, and rebranded the airport using the phrase [...] "pure dead brilliant", taken straight from the Glasgow patter. Some of the rebranding has been controversial, in particular the redecoration of the airport bar. The bar was rebranded in February 2006 with a logo depicting {{a man in a}} kilt, unconscious with an <b>empty</b> <b>bottle</b> of whisky. Despite objections that it promoted the wrong image of Scotland to foreign visitors and embarrassed local travellers, the airport management insisted the logo was [...] "fun and visually stimulating". However, it was removed a matter of weeks after installation, after the South Ayrshire Licensing Board said the logo trivialised excessive drinking. The [...] "pure dead brilliant" [...] branding was removed from the main terminal building in January 2014.|$|E

At the bottler, the bottles would be inspected for damage, cleaned, sanitized, and refilled.|$|R

2500|$|Soldiers capture Grenouille {{moments after}} he {{finishes}} preparing his perfume. On {{the day of}} his execution, he applies the perfume on himself, forcing the jailers to release him. The executioner and the crowd in attendance are speechless at the beauty of the perfume; they declare Grenouille innocent before falling into a massive orgy. Richis, still convinced of Grenouille's guilt, threatens him with his sword, but he is then overwhelmed by the scent and embraces Grenouille as his [...] "son." [...] Walking out of Grasse unscathed, Grenouille has enough perfume to rule the world, but has discovered that it will not allow him to love or be loved like a normal person. Disenchanted by his aimless quest, he returns to the Parisian fish market where he was born and pours the remaining perfume over his head. Overcome by the scent and in the belief that Grenouille is an angel, the nearby crowd devours him. The next morning, all that is left are his clothes and the <b>empty</b> <b>bottle,</b> from which one final drop of perfume falls.|$|E
2500|$|A 0.75-mile (1.1-km) hike {{leads to}} the edge of the crater's rim. Signs at the trailhead say that the hike takes 1.5–2 hours round-trip, and {{recommends}} that hikers bring water. Although not difficult, the signs also say that the hike is not a casual one: the mostly unpaved trail winds over uneven rock, ascends 74 steps, then through a tunnel and up another steep 99 steps. Next is a small lighted tunnel to a narrow spiral staircase (43 steps) inside a coastal artillery observation platform built in 1908. From the summit above the observation platform both Waikīkī and the Pacific Ocean can be seen in detail. It is a short but steep hike – it is a 170 m (560ft) elevation gain for a total elevation of 232 m (762ft). There is a water fountain near the bathrooms at the foot of the trail in case you want to hydrate before the hike or fill an <b>empty</b> <b>bottle.</b> The park closes at 6:00 pm and signs posted indicate that you are not allowed to head up the trail after 4:30 pm. [...] A downloadable certificate is available to those who complete the climb.|$|E
2500|$|Near {{the body}} was the cap from a bottle of [...] "Sierra Silver" [...] tequila, {{in the shape of}} a red plastic sombrero, and a {{corresponding}} <b>empty</b> <b>bottle</b> was found on the other side of a small path nearby. Near one foot police found another bottle which was tested for traces of an accelerant. Laura Wilcock, a forensic scientist with specialist expertise in examining suspicious fires, concluded that the body could have been burning for up to seven hours, and very little of it was undamaged by the burning. The palm of the right hand remained relatively undamaged and this was swabbed for DNA evidence. The extensive burning of the body hampered pathologists from ascertaining a cause of death, and Dr. Julia Bell, a forensic pathologist at the University of Glasgow Medical School said that the possibilities for a full post mortem were [...] "limited". Bell said she was unable to completely exclude the possibility that setting the teenager on fire had killed her but believed [...] "the findings [...] not suggestive of this": while the natural instinct of a person on fire would be to move, there was no evidence of this, probably because Nelson was unconscious or dead. Examination of Nelson's respiratory tract did not demonstrate soot in the quantities which would indicate she had still been breathing and scientists had been unable to carry out blood analysis which might have provided further proof.|$|E
5000|$|The song {{makes use}} {{of a number of}} metaphors, most {{prominently}} the song's title [...] "Down Among the Dead Men."
