40|$|The {{visual cortex}} in {{primates}} {{consists of an}} array of anatomically and chemically identifiable cellular modules (hypercolumns) with distinct physiological properties. For example, layers II/III in the macaque monkey contain a regular array of cytochrome oxidase-rich blobs. Furthermore, the surrounding cytochrome oxidase-poor interblob regions have a higher density of neuropeptide Y-positive aspiny stellate cells. Neurons in the blobs are thought to mediate predominantly low spatial frequencies and color vision, while those in the interblobs appear {{to be engaged in}} pattern vision and high spatial frequency analysis. In this study we examined the role of the retina in the development of hypercolumns. A bilateral retinal ablation was performed in embryos at midgestation, before any photoreceptors had established contacts with other retinal neurons and before layers II/III of the cortex [...] or their synaptic connection [...] had been generated. We found that the cortex in operated animals had cytochrome oxidase blobs and that their size and spacing were normal. In addition, neuropeptide Y-containing neurons were preferentially distributed in the <b>interblob</b> <b>region</b> as in control animals. Our findings indicate that some basic aspects of the cyto- and chemoarchitectonic organization of the cerebral cortex, which presumably evolved for the analysis of form and color, can emerge in the absence of cues from the retinal photoreceptors that mediate these attributes of vision...|$|E
40|$|The basic {{principle}} {{of the most frequently}} used functional neuroimaging methods is the brain’s local dynamic regulation of blood flow. For a correct interpretation of neuroimaging results the structural and functional neurovascular coupling underlying this regulation must be well understood. Here we report quantitative anatomical data of the microvasculature in the macaque visual cortex. Formalin-fixed frozen sections of 4 animals (M. mulatta) were processed for double fluorescence immunohistochemistry. Sections were incubated with anti-collagen type IV and DAPI to stain for vessels and cell nuclei. In one additional animal, the anti-collagen procedure was combined with cytochrome oxidase staining in V 1. The length density (LD), surface density (SD), volume fraction (VF) and diameter (D) of the vessels were stereologically determined. Furthermore, synchrotron-based computed tomographies (SRCT) of formalin-fixed and barium sulfate-perfused brain samples from another 2 animals were used to corroborate the histological results. In V 1, the vascular density was highest in layer IVc- (LD 674. 7 mm/mm 3, SD 15. 2 mm 2 /mm 3, VF 2. 6, D 7. 2 microns) and lowest in layer I (LD 461. 5 mm/mm 3, SD 10. 9 mm 2 /mm 3, VF 1. 9, D 7. 5 microns). In all extrastriate visual areas analyzed (V 2, V 3, V 4, V 5), the vascular density was generally lower, and the difference between layer IV and the remaining layers was less prominent when compared to V 1. These density values were similar compared to the ones tomographically obtained from SRCT. The vascular density in cytochrome oxidase rich blobs in V 1 was 14 higher as compared to the <b>interblob</b> <b>region.</b> In summary, V 1 is different from all extrastriate areas analyzed with respect to the laminar vessel distribution and overall vascular density. Differences between extrastriate areas were negligible. The overall vascular volume fraction in visual cortex derived from immunostaining was approximately 2, a value that was well reproduced by the SRCT...|$|E
40|$|The close {{correlation}} between energy supply by {{blood vessels and}} energy consumption by cellular processes in the brain {{is the basis of}} blood flow-related functional imaging techniques. Regional differences in vascular density can be detected using high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging. Therefore, inhomogeneities in vascularization might help to identify anatomically distinct areas noninvasively in vivo. It was reported previously that cytochrome oxidase-rich blobs in the striate cortex of squirrel monkeys are characterized by a notably higher vascular density (42 % higher than <b>interblob</b> <b>regions).</b> However, blobs have so far never been identified in vivo {{on the basis of their}} vascular density. Here, we analyzed blobs of the primary visual cortex of squirrel monkeys and macaques with respect to the relationship between vascularization and cytochrome oxidase activity. By double staining with cytochrome oxidase enzyme histochemistry to define the blobs and collagen type IV immunohistochemistry to quantify the blood vessels, a close {{correlation between}} oxidative metabolism and vascularization was confirmed and quantified in detail. The vascular length density in cytochrome oxidase blobs was on average 4. 5 % higher than in the <b>interblob</b> <b>regions,</b> a difference almost one order of magnitude smaller than previously reported. Thus, the vascular density that is closely associated with local average metabolic activity is a structural equivalent of cerebral metabolism and blood flow. However, the quantitative differences in vascularization between blob and <b>interblob</b> <b>regions</b> are small and below the detectability threshold of the noninvasive hemodynamic imaging methods of today...|$|R
5000|$|From the LGN, the M pathway {{continues}} {{by sending}} {{information to the}} <b>interblob</b> <b>regions</b> of the 4Cα layer of the V1 region of the visual cortex, also called the [...] "striate cortex". Other cells in the striate are more influenced from signaling from P cells and yet others from K cells. As signals are passed to {{other regions of the}} cortex, the signals start to be less separate, more integrated, and more influenced by signals {{from other parts of the}} brain. While classically it is said that signaling through the M pathway ultimately flow out of the visual cortex through the dorsal stream and signaling through the P pathway ultimately flows to the ventral stream, subsequent studies have shown that both pathways influence both streams.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The primary {{visual cortex}} of the primate shows {{distinct}} regions of increased cytochrome oxidase activity, the so called “blobs”. When visualized in tangential sections the blobs form a pattern of regularly distributed patches which are most prominent in the third cortical layer. Since cytochrome oxidase is an enzyme of the oxidative chain, increased local enzyme activity indicates an increased metabolic activity of a given region. It {{has been shown in}} the squirrel monkey cortex that this metabolic difference is reflected in the density of the cortical vascularization. The aim {{of this study was to}} replicate and extend this finding with a quantitative and layer specific assessment of the vascular density in blob and <b>interblob</b> <b>regions.</b> Methods: Formalin-fixed frozen sections of 2 animals (M. mulatta) were first stained with the classical cytochrome oxidase staining method that uses the enzyme activity to precipitate DAB. The sections were then further processed for fluorescence immunohistochemistry. They were incubated with anti-collagen type IV and a Cy 3 -conjugated secondary antibody to stain for blood vessels. Epifluorescence micrographs were taken and the vessels were manually and automatically delineated. The length density (mm/mm³) and volume fraction (mm³/mm³) of vessels was taken as a measure for the vascular density. The blobs were determined in the corresponding brightfield micrograph of the same section on the basis of the cytochrome oxidase stain. Results: The vascular length density and volume fraction was significantly higher inside the blobs as compared to the <b>interblob</b> <b>regions</b> (paired t-test, p< 0. 001). The absolute values were 535. 2 +/- 57. 8 mm/mm³ (mean +/- SD of 2 animals) for the blobs and 485. 5 +/- 51. 2 mm/mm³ for interblob areas, which is 108. 7 for blobs and 98. 1 for interblobs of the overall mean vascular length density in V 1. The blob-interblob difference was most prominent in cortical layer IV. Conclusion: In summary, the blobs’ vascular density is significantly higher as compared to the surrounding cortex in V 1. This reflects an adaptation of blood supply in these metabolically and most likely also functionally different regions of V 1. However, the measured difference is considerably smaller when compared to the previously published data. This discrepancy could be due inter-species or methodological differences between the studies...|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of studies to map spatial {{frequency}} tuning of neurons in layers 2 and 3 of macaque striate cortex, we found that a high proportion (70 %) of cells in the <b>interblob</b> <b>regions</b> responded poorly to full-field gratings, compared with responses to single bars, edges, or delimited gratings. This was most often due to side inhibition, in which {{increasing the number of}} cycles of a grating placed within the cell's receptive field causes progressive inhibition of response. Quantitative receptive-field mappings showed, however, that the inhibition can occur within the region activated by a bar, as well as beyond it. The inhibition appears to be orientation-selective, in that a surround grating was more effective at inhibiting the response to a center grating patch if it was of similar orientation. 2 -Deoxyglucose experiments confirmed that side inhibition is very widespread in the interblobs of layers 2 and 3 and suggested that it is reduced or lacking in layers 4 A through 6. Since layers 2 and 3 of striate cortex are the major source of cortical projections to area V 2 and beyond, the prevalence of side stopping in these laminae has implications for theories of cortical visual function. Side-stopped interblob cells may be acting as "contour-pass filters" that filter out redundant information in textured or noisy surfaces, focusing subsequent form processing on contrasts corresponding to object boundaries...|$|R
40|$|Previously, we {{reported}} that the receptive-field (RF) center/surround organization of V 1 and V 2 neurons in macaques is immature during the first postnatal 8 weeks (Zhang et al, 2005). To gain insight into such functional immaturity, we examined the development of intrinsic and corticocortical connections {{in some of these}} infant monkeys. In 2 -, 4 - and 16 -week-old infants and adults, we placed pressure injections of the tracers CTB and WGA-HRP along the posterior bank of the lunate sulcus. Following two to four days of transport, each animal was perfused. The brain was artificially flattened, cut, and stained for cytochrome oxidase (CO) or either tracer. CO sections were used to identify the V 1 /V 2 border, stripe types, and blobs within V 1. In some respects connection patterns were relatively mature even after two weeks of postnatal development. At two weeks, thin stripe injections showed strong connections with V 1 blobs, thin stripes and other stripes in V 2. Thick stripe injections did not preferentially label cells associated with blob or <b>interblob</b> <b>regions.</b> The label found within stripes was patchy at two weeks of age, as in older monkeys. V 1 injections in two week old monkeys resulted in patches of labeled cells near the injection site. These connectional features were also observed in older monkeys. Thus, the presence of aspects of ‘adult-like’ connections at two weeks of age suggests that the basic pattern of intrinsic connections is present in V 1 and V 2 near birth. However, the RF surround mechanisms of V 1 and V 2 neurons are very immature at this age and adult-like responses emerge much later (Zhang et al, PNAS, 2005). The RF surround mechanisms of V 2 (and V 1) neurons likely depend more on the developmental elaboration of long-range horizontal connections, and/or the maturation of feedback connections from higher-order visual areas...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{striate cortex}} of macaque monkeys {{contains}} {{an array of}} patches which stain heavily for the enzyme cytochrome oxidase (CO blobs). Cells inside and outside these blobs are often described as belonging to two distinct populations or streams. In order {{to better understand the}} function of the CO blobs, we measured the contrast sensitivity and spatial frequency response of single neurons in and around the CO blobs. Density profiles of each blob were assessed using a new quantitative method, and correlations of local CO density with the physiology were noted. We found that the CO density dropped off gradually with distance from blob centers: in a typical blob the CO density dropped from 75 % to 25 % over 100 μm. Recordings were confined to cortical layers 2 / 3. Most neurons in these layers have poor contrast sensitivity, {{similar to that of the}} parvocellular neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus. However, in a small proportion of layers 2 / 3 neurons we found higher contrast sensitivity, similar to that of the magnocellular neurons. These neurons were found to cluster near blob centers. This finding is consistent with (indirect) parvocellular input spread uniformly throughout layers 2 / 3, and (indirect) magnocellular input focused on CO blobs. We also measured spatial tuning curves for both single units and multiple unit activity. In agreement with other workers we found that the optimal spatial frequencies of cells near blob centers were low (median 2. 8 c/deg), while the optimal frequencies of cells in the <b>interblob</b> <b>regions</b> were spread over a wide range of spatial frequencies. The high cut-off spatial frequency of multi-unit activity increased with distance from blob centers. We found no correlation between spatial bandwidth and distance from blob centers. All measured physiological properties varied gradually with distance from CO blob centers. This suggests that the view of blob cells subserving visual functions which are entirely distinct from non-blob cells may have to be reevaluated...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to the major anatomical pathways from Vl into the temporal lobe, there are other smaller, “bypass ” routes that are poorly understood. To investigate the direct projection from Vl to V 4 (bypassing V 2) and from V 2 to TEO (bypassing V 4), we injected the fovea 1 and parafoveal representations of V 4 and TEO with different retrograde tracers in five hemispheres of four macaques and analyzed the distributions of labeled neurons in Vl and V 2 using flattened preparations of the cortex. In Vl, labeled neurons were seen after injections in V 4 but not TEO. The V 4 -projecting neurons were located in the fovea 1 representation of Vl, in both cytochrome oxidase (CO) -rich blobs and CO-poor <b>interblob</b> <b>regions.</b> In V 2, TEO-projecting neurons were intermingled with V 4 -projecting neurons, although the former were far sparser than the latter. Across the cases, 6 -l 9 % of the TEOprojecting neurons were double labeled, that is, also projected to area V 4. Both V 4 - and TEO-projecting neurons formed bands that ran orthogonal to the Vl IV 2 border, and both were located in CO-rich thin stripes and CO-poor interstripe regions. In some cases, a continuous band of V 4 projecting neurons was also found along the Vl /V 2 border in the fovea 1 representation of V 2. The {{results indicate that the}} pathways from Vl to V 4 and from V 2 to TEO involve anatomical subcompartments thought to be concerned with both color and form. These “bypass ” routes may allow coarse information about color and form to arrive rapidly in the temporal lobe. The bypass route from V 2 to TEO might explain the partial sparing of color and form vision that is seen after lesions of V 4. By analogy, given the bypass route from the fovea 1 representation of Vl to V 4, lesions of V 2 affecting the fovea 1 visual field would also be insufficient to block color and form vision.

40|$|Cortical {{maps and}} {{feedback}} connections are ubiquitous {{features of the}} visual cerebral cortex. The role of the feedback connections, however, is unclear. This study was aimed at revealing possible organizational relationships between the feedback projections from area V 2 and the functional maps of orientation and retinotopy in area V 1. Optical imaging of intrinsic signals was combined with cytochrome oxidase histochemistry and connectional anatomy in owl monkeys. Tracer injections were administered at orientation-selective domains in regions of pale and thick cytochrome oxidase stripes adjacent to the border between these stripes. The feedback projections from V 2 {{were found to be}} more diffuse than the intrinsic horizontal connections within V 1, but they nevertheless demonstrated clustering. The clusters of feedback axons projected preferentially to <b>interblob</b> cytochrome oxidase <b>regions.</b> The distribution of preferred orientations of the recipient domains in V 1 was broad but appeared biased toward values similar to the preferred orientation of the projecting cells in V 2. The global spatial distribution of the feedback projections in V 1 was anisotropic. The major axis of anisotropy was systematically parallel to a retinotopic axis in V 1 corresponding to the preferred orientation of the cells of origin in V 2. We conclude that the feedback connections from V 2 to V 1 might play a role in enhancing the response in V 1 to collinear contour elements...|$|R
