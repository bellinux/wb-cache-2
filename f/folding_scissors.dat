5000|$|An [...] (from the French, for keeper or holder) is a woman's {{ornamental}} case, usually {{carried in}} a pocket or purse. It holds small tools for daily use such as <b>folding</b> <b>scissors,</b> bodkins, sewing needles (a needlecase), hairpins, tweezers, makeup pencils, etc. Some étuis were also used to carry doctors' lancets.

50|$|When two or {{more people}} {{are working on the}} same or {{different}} parts of a larger overall system, there must be multiple holes to lock the device. To expand the number of available holes, the locked-out device is secured with a <b>folding</b> <b>scissors</b> clamp that has many pairs of padlock holes capable of keeping it closed. Each worker applies their own padlock to the clamp. The locked-out device cannot be activated until all workers have removed their padlocks from the clamp.In the United States a lock selected by color, shape or size (e.g. red padlock) is used to designate a standard safety device, locking and securing hazardous energy. No two keys or locks should ever be the same. A person's lock and tag must only be removed by the individual who installed the lock and tag unless removal is accomplished {{under the direction of the}} employer. Employer procedures and training for such removal must have been developed, documented and incorporated into the employer energy control program.|$|E

500|$|After {{a year in}} existence, {{the band}} had earned a total of $600. They now faced two options: divide the money among the members, or press the {{recordings}} they had made with Zientara at Inner Ear. Choosing the latter, Nelson, Strejcek and MacKaye formed Dischord Records with Groff's help, to release the recordings. The band sent the tapes to a pressing plant in Nashville, Tennessee that specialized in pressing country music records. Initially puzzled by the request to put eight songs on a 7" [...] record, they pressed 1,000 copies. For the cover, the band took apart another 7" [...] record sleeve and {{used it as a}} template for their own cover design. They photocopied it on 11" [...] × 17" [...] paper, which the band members cut out with <b>scissors,</b> <b>folded</b> and glued by hand, then into these inserted the records and lyric sheets. Released in December 1980, Minor Disturbance was a local success, receiving radio airplay and reviews from fanzines such as Touch and Go, which meant that Dischord now had enough money to release records by other bands.|$|R
