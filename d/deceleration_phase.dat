5000|$|On {{the other}} extreme, the more light and slow a {{projectile}} is, the more relevant sloping becomes. Typical World War II Armoured Piercing shells were bullet-shaped {{and had a}} much lower velocity than a shaped charge jet. An impact would not result in a complete melting of projectile and armour. In this condition {{the strength of the}} armour material becomes a relevant factor. If the projectile would be very light and slow, the strength of the armour might even cause the hit to result in just an elastic deformation, the projectile being defeated without damage to the target. Sloping will mean the projectile will have to attain a higher velocity to defeat the armour, because on impact on a sloped armour not all kinetic energy is transferred to the target, the ratio depending on the slope angle. The projectile in a process of elastic collision deflects at an angle of 2 (where [...] denotes the angle between the armour plate surface and the projectile's initial direction), however the change of direction could be virtually divided into a deceleration part, when the projectile is halted when moving in a direction perpendicular to the plate (and will move along the plate after having been deflected at an angle of about [...] ), and a process of elastic acceleration, when the projectile accelerates out of the plate (velocity along the plate is considered as invariant because of negligible friction).

It was shown that: (1) viewing the hand prior to movement decreased pointing variability {{as compared to the}} dark condition. (2) Viewing simultaneously hand and target (H+T) and further decreased pointing variability as compared to the H-T condition. This effect was proportional to the reaction time.

40|$|Abstract Background How glial {{cells and}} cytokines are {{associated}} with the progression of delayed neuronal death induced by transient global ischemia is still unclear. To further clarify this point, we studied morphological changes in glial cells (microglial cells and astrocytes), and cytokine protein levels, during the progression of neuronal cell loss in CA 1 (Cornu Ammonis 1) of the hippocampus after transient global ischemia. Methods Morphological changes in glial cells were studied immuno-histochemically. Nine cytokines (IL- 1 α, IL- 1 β, IL- 2, IL- 4, IL- 6, IL- 10, GM-CSF, IFN-γ and TNF-α) were simultaneously measured by a multiplexed bead-based immunoassay from 6 h to day 21 after transient four vessel occlusion (4 VO) in rats. Results During the process of neuronal loss, we observed four distinct phases: (1) lag phase day 0 - 2 (no NeuN+ cell loss observed), (2) exponential phase day 2 - 7 (NeuN+ cells reduced in number exponentially), (3) <b>deceleration</b> <b>phase</b> day 7 - 14 (reduction rate of NeuN+ cells became low), (4) stationary phase day 14 onward (NeuN+ cell loss progressed no longer). In the lag phase, activated glial cells were observed in the entire hippocampus but later were gradually restricted to CA 1. Cytokine protein levels in the lag and exponential phases were lower than in the deceleration and stationary phases. IL- 1 α, IL- 1 β, IL- 4, IL- 6 and IFN-γ in 4 VO were significantly higher in all four phases than in sham. Compared with sham level, GM-CSF was significantly high in the <b>deceleration</b> <b>phase.</b> TNF-α was significantly high in both the deceleration and stationary phases. Conclusion Ischemic stress in 4 VO activated glial cells in areas beyond CA 1 in the lag phase. Pyramidal neurons were injured in CA 1 {{from the end of the}} lag phase and then neuronal cells reduced in CA 1 in the exponential phase. After neuronal death began, the influence of dead cells on glial cells and cytokine expression gradually became stronger than the influence by ischemic stress. Therefore, from the <b>deceleration</b> <b>phase,</b> changes in glial cells and cytokine production were likely caused by dead cells. Cytokine interaction in the microenvironment may determine the functions of IL- 1 α, IL- 1 β, IL- 4, IL- 6 and IFN-γ in all four phases. The function of GM-CSF and TNF-α in the <b>deceleration</b> <b>phase</b> may be neurotrophic. </p...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a mechanism with the following specifications: continuous alternate motion, wide motion phases with constant angular velocity, parallel input and output shafts, and great strokes. Those specifications derive from a possible application in the textile field. The mechanism is composed of two star wheels properly coupled together: there are two counter-rotating input wheels, alternately coupling with slots first, then teeth at each side of the output wheel. As usual for star wheels, pins and slots handle the acceleration and <b>deceleration</b> <b>phases,</b> while the constant velocity phase is performed by coupling sectors of toothed gears. A proper design of pins and slots is performed, so {{that at the same time}} when a pin from one input wheel is releasing a slot, a pin from the other input wheel engages a slot on the other side of the output wheel, forcing the latter to an opposite motion. In this way the output wheel has a continuous and smooth alternate motion.
