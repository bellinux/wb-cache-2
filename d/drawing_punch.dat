40|$|Compound process {{technology}} has been investigated for many years on a macro scale, {{but only a few}} studies can be found on a micro scale due to the difficulties in tool manufacturing, parts transporting and punch-die alignment. In this paper, a novel technology of combining the laser shock wave and soft punch was introduced to fabricate the dish-shaped micro-parts on copper to solve these difficulties. This compound process includes deep <b>drawing,</b> <b>punching</b> and blanking and these processes can be completed almost at the same time because the duration time of laser is quite short, so the precision of the micro-parts can be ensured. A reasonable laser energy of 1550 mJ made the morphology, depth of deformation, dimensional accuracy and surface roughness achieve their best results when the thickness of the soft punches was 200 μm. In addition, thicker soft punches may hinder the compound process due to the action of unloading waves based on the elastic wave theory. So, the greatest thickness of the soft punches was 200 μm...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Forming {{tools for}} a press are usually {{machined}} with {{computer numerical control}} (CNC) machine tools. This could be quite time consuming—calculating tool tracks, selecting cutting tools, cutting blanks, design fixation and finally machining—especially for a small batch of parts. One alternative method is to cut a die and <b>draw</b> <b>punch</b> tools from a blank sheet and join the plates together. Clamping plates together is fast and easy to implement by using, for example, threaded rods and guide bars with a certain tolerance to ensure alignment. A laser, a waterjet or a plasma cutter {{can be used for}} cutting plates. The laser and the fine beam plasma cutting in particular are precise methods that give a fine surface quality even without a need for fine-tuning [4]. The method saves material compared with machining because a die and a punch could be cut at the same time from a blank sheet as a compatible pair; in addition, the required number of plates could be estimated depending of the length of a pressed product. The University of Oulu, Oulu Southern Institute and the Future Manufacturing Technology group has manufactured several forming tools within this technique and found it suitable for easily experimenting with different solutions and options. Furthermore, the method is likely to help especially small and medium enterprise (SMEs) in research and development phase by lowering production costs in an efficient way...|$|R
