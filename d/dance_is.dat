5|$|Hip-hop <b>dance</b> <b>is</b> not a studio-derived style. Street dancers {{developed}} it {{in urban}} neighborhoods without a formal process. All {{of the early}} substyles and social dances were brought about {{through a combination of}} events including inspiration from James Brown, DJ Kool Herc's invention of the break beat, the formation of dance crews, and Don Cornelius' creation of the television show Soul Train.|$|E
5|$|If a human {{watched the}} dance of the elves, he would {{discover}} that even though {{only a few hours}} seemed to have passed, many years had passed in the real world. Humans being invited or lured to the elf <b>dance</b> <b>is</b> a common motif transferred from older Scandinavian ballads.|$|E
5|$|The Nifo oti, or Samoan fire knife <b>dance,</b> <b>is</b> also a kind {{of weapon}} dance. The kailao is a {{standing}} male war dance of Tonga. The kailao is performed by men (less commonly women also perform it with the men as a mixed dance), who carry clubs or fighting sticks.

Additional idiophonic percussion is provided by strung rattles worn on the anklets of the dancers, and the clashing together of the wooden implements of war, which today are either sticks or mock weapons.

5000|$|Folk <b>dances</b> <b>are</b> <b>dances</b> that <b>are</b> {{developed}} by people {{that reflect the}} life of the people of a certain country or region. Not all ethnic <b>dances</b> <b>are</b> folk dances; for example, ritual dances or dances of ritual origin are not considered to <b>be</b> folk <b>dances.</b> Ritual <b>dances</b> <b>are</b> usually called [...] "Religious dances" [...] because of their purpose.|$|R

5|$|The Sunrise Dance Ceremony is not {{an ancient}} Yavapai ceremony. Apache and Yavapai often intermarried and adopted {{elements}} of each other's cultures; these two tribes reside together on the Camp Verde and Fort McDowell reservations. The Sunrise <b>Dance</b> <b>is</b> a four-day rite-of-transition for young Apache girls, which typically takes place from March through October. The sunrise <b>dance</b> <b>is</b> an ancient practice, unique to the Apache. It {{is related to the}} myth of the Changing Woman, a powerful figure in Apache culture who is believed to grant longevity. The power of Changing Woman is transferred to the pubescent girl through songs sung by the Medicine Man. A medicine man is joined by other tribal members in singing a series of songs, up to 32 which are believed to have first been sung by Changing Woman.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} {{agricultural}} societies, Torajans dance and sing during harvest time.

There are several war dances, {{such as the}} Manimbong dance performed by men, followed by the Ma'dandan dance performed by women. The aluk religion governs when and how Torajans dance. A dance called Ma'bua can be performed only once every 12 years. Ma'bua is a major Toraja ceremony in which priests wear a buffalo head and dance around a sacred tree.|$|E
5|$|Dancers in the United Kingdom {{have had}} success in hip-hop theater. In 2006, hip-hop dance company Boy Blue Entertainment won a Laurence Olivier Award for their show Pied Piper. In 2008, Into the Hoods {{became the first}} hip-hop theater show to perform in London's West End. It {{eventually}} {{went on to become}} the West End's longest running dance show ever. According to Clemente, the future of hip-hop <b>dance</b> <b>is</b> in theater; he believes it is necessary for the dance to make this transition in order for it to be legitimized as an art form.|$|E

5|$|Modern Chinese dragons {{are also}} often green, but unlike European dragons, they are benevolent; Chinese dragons {{traditionally}} symbolize potent and auspicious powers, particularly control over water, rainfall, hurricane, and floods. The dragon {{is also a}} symbol of power, strength, and good luck. The Emperor of China usually used the dragon {{as a symbol of}} his imperial power and strength. The dragon <b>dance</b> <b>is</b> a popular feature of Chinese festivals.|$|E
5|$|Since <b>dance</b> <b>is</b> {{already an}} art form, “weapon dance as art” may seem redundant; yet, “art” is used here {{to mean the}} re-creation, say, of a folk weapon dance in a more {{professional}} staged venue, such as a ballet, or when an Australian, Native American, or African troupe of professional musicians and dancers present a reenactment on stage of a weapon dance, or when the use of weapons is introduced in stylized dance enactments of fighting. For example, recent ballets such as the New York City Ballet’s version of Romeo and Juliet (to the music of Sergei Prokofiev) employ highly choreographed sword-fight/dance sequences.|$|E

5|$|The {{commercialization of}} hip-hop dance {{continued}} into the 1990s and 2000s with the production of several television shows and movies such as The Grind, Planet B-Boy, Rize, StreetDance 3D, America's Best Dance Crew, Saigon Electric, the Step Up film series, and The LXD, a web series. Though the <b>dance</b> <b>is</b> established in entertainment, including mild representation in theater, it maintains a strong presence in urban neighborhoods {{which has led to}} the creation of street dance derivatives Memphis jookin, turfing, jerkin', and krumping.|$|E
5|$|There are {{virtually}} no {{parts of the}} world left where the weapon <b>dance</b> <b>is</b> directly connected with imminent or recent combat. This is especially true of European states, which have long since moved away from the tribalism that usually gives rise to such folk dances. It is, however, also true of {{parts of the world}} where tribal traditions have succumbed to colonialism and the forces of globalism. The dances that one sees today are often part of general movements to preserve and rejuvenate tribal or local traditions. Some of these movements are quite strong now, such as those among native North American tribes and the aboriginal peoples of Australia.|$|E
5|$|Torajans perform dances {{on several}} occasions, most often during their {{elaborate}} funeral ceremonies. They dance {{to express their}} grief, and to honour and even cheer the deceased person because {{he is going to}} have a long journey in the afterlife. First, a group of men form a circle and sing a monotonous chant throughout the night to honour the deceased (a ritual called Ma'badong). This is considered by many Torajans to be the most important component of the funeral ceremony. On the second funeral day, the Ma'randing warrior <b>dance</b> <b>is</b> performed to praise the courage of the deceased during life. Several men perform the dance with a sword, a large shield made from buffalo skin, a helmet with a buffalo horn, and other ornamentation. The Ma'randing dance precedes a procession in which the deceased is carried from a rice barn to the rante, the site of the funeral ceremony. During the funeral, elder women perform the Ma'katia dance while singing a poetic song and wearing a long feathered costume. The Ma'akatia <b>dance</b> <b>is</b> performed to remind the audience of the generosity and loyalty of the deceased person. After the bloody ceremony of buffalo and pig slaughter, a group of boys and girls clap their hands while performing a cheerful dance called Ma'dondan.|$|E

50|$|Many of {{the folk}} <b>dances</b> <b>are</b> related to harvest and hunting {{and the ancient}} gods {{associated}} with them.

5000|$|Dance {{has existed}} in Ukraine as a ritual since ancient times, {{but it was}} mostly absorbed by Christianity and blended with Christian rituals. [...] The {{earliest}} <b>dances</b> <b>were</b> circle <b>dances</b> concerned with agriculture. Dances took place on Ivan Kupala day, St. George's day, Pentecost, days of harvest, and weddings. Ritual <b>dances</b> <b>were</b> rarely performed to music, and usually to a chant. Folk <b>dances</b> <b>were</b> performed with or without music. The majority of Ukrainian folk <b>dances</b> <b>are</b> circular. Some {{of the most famous}} <b>dances</b> <b>are</b> the Arkan and Hopak. <b>Dance</b> <b>was</b> also enriched with traditional Ukrainian folk dress. Today many Ukrainian dance groups exist in Ukraine and the Ukrainian diaspora, particularly in Canada, and have kept the tradition of folk dancing alive.|$|R
5|$|A {{centre of}} Buddhist {{learning}} and culture, Gangtok's most notable Buddhist institutions are the Enchey monastery, the Do-drul Chorten stupa complex and the Rumtek Monastery. The Enchey monastery is the city's oldest monastery {{and is the}} seat of the Nyingma order.

Though the devadasi practice has been discontinued, the dance form has become modern and classical and is widely popular; many of the Odissi virtuoso artists and gurus (teachers) are from Puri. Some of the famous Odissi dancers are Kelucharan Mohapatra, Mayadhar Raut, Sonal Mansingh, Sanjukta Panigrahi and many more.|$|E
5|$|During the Sun Dance, {{which is}} practiced by many Plains Indian tribes, the eagle is {{represented}} in several ways. The eagle nest {{is represented by the}} fork of the lodge where the <b>dance</b> <b>is</b> held. A whistle made from the wing bone of an eagle is used {{during the course of the}} dance. Also during the dance, a medicine man may direct his fan, which is made of eagle feathers, to people who seek to be healed. The medicine man touches the fan to the center pole and then to the patient, in order to transmit power from the pole to the patient. The fan is then held up toward the sky, so that the eagle may carry the prayers for the sick to the Creator.|$|E
