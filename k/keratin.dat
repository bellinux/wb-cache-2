5|$|The human {{esophagus}} has a {{mucous membrane}} {{consisting of a}} tough stratified squamous epithelium without <b>keratin,</b> a smooth lamina propria, and a muscularis mucosae. The epithelium of the esophagus has a relatively rapid turnover, and serves a protective function against the abrasive effects of food. In many animals the epithelium contains a layer of <b>keratin,</b> representing a coarser diet. There {{are two types of}} glands, with mucus-secreting esophageal glands being found in the submucosa, and esophageal cardiac glands, similar to cardiac glands of the stomach, located in the lamina propria and most frequent in the terminal part of the organ. The mucus from the glands gives a good protection to the lining. The submucosa also contains the submucosal plexus, a network of nerve cells {{that is part of the}} enteric nervous system.|$|E

5|$|Acne vulgaris is {{a chronic}} skin {{disease of the}} pilosebaceous unit and {{develops}} due to blockages in the skin's hair follicles. These blockages are thought to occur {{as a result of}} the following four abnormal processes: a higher than normal amount of oily sebum production (influenced by androgens), excessive deposition of the protein <b>keratin</b> leading to comedo formation, colonization of the follicle by Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) bacteria, and the local release of pro-inflammatory chemicals in the skin.|$|E

40|$|Background: Several protein markers, {{including}} vimentin, {{have been}} used to diagnose human melanoma. Because mel-anoma often has metastasized by the time of diagnosis, early markers prognostic for metastatic potential need to be iden-tified. Commonly, vimentin is found in mesenchymal cells, and <b>keratins</b> are present in epithelial cells, but recent studies report coexpression of vimentin and <b>keratin(s)</b> in epithelial and nonepithelial neoplasms, including some melanomas. Purpose: Our purpose was to determine whether co-expression of vimentin and <b>keratin(s)</b> is correlated with tumor cell invasion and metastatic behavior. Methods: We evaluated nine human melanoma cell lines expressing vimentin and other markers of aggressive tumor behavior (HMB- 45, S- 100, HLA-ABC class I and HLA-DR class U histocompatibility antigens, and K 8 and K 18 <b>keratins).</b> Lev...|$|R
40|$|The {{aberrant}} expression of embryonic simple epithelial <b>keratins</b> K 8 and K 18 {{has been previously}} detected in chemically-induced mouse skin carcinomas and in cultured epidermal keratinocytes containing H-ras oncogenes. In this study, we report that cell lines derived from benign papillomas do not generally synthesize simple epithelial <b>keratins,</b> regardless {{of the presence of}} H-ras gene alterations. These results reinforce our previous suggestion that the expression of these <b>keratins</b> during mouse epidermal carcinogenesis is a marker of malignant transformation. The comparison of the two-dimensional electrophoresis intermediate filament protein profiles of transformed keratinocytes in culture, reveal that during in vitro progression to the malignant phenotype increased synthesis of simple epithelial <b>keratins</b> is associated to a general disturbance on the expression of cytoskeletal proteins.

5|$|Daniela Schwarz {{and colleagues}} (2007) {{concluded}} that the bifurcated neural spines of diplodocids and dicraeosaurids enclosed an air sac, {{which would have been}} connected to the lungs as part of the respiratory system. In Dicraeosaurus, this air sac (the so-called supravertebral diverticulum) would have rested on top of the neural arch and filled the entire space between the spines. In Amargasaurus the upper two-thirds of the spines would have been covered by a sheath of <b>keratin,</b> restricting the air sac to the space between the lower one-third of the spines.|$|E
5|$|Odontocetes, such as {{the sperm}} whale, possess teeth with {{cementum}} cells overlying dentine cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on {{the portion of the}} tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. Only in larger whales, where the cementum is worn away on the tip of the tooth, does enamel show. Mysticetes have large whalebone, as opposed to teeth, made of <b>keratin.</b> Mysticetes have two blowholes, whereas Odontocetes contain only one.|$|E
5|$|Proteins can be informally {{divided into}} three main classes, which {{correlate}} with typical tertiary structures: globular proteins, fibrous proteins, and membrane proteins. Almost all globular proteins are soluble and many are enzymes. Fibrous proteins are often structural, such as collagen, the major component of connective tissue, or <b>keratin,</b> the protein component of hair and nails. Membrane proteins often serve as receptors or provide channels for polar or charged molecules {{to pass through the}} cell membrane.|$|E

5|$|Several twentieth-century writers {{explored}} {{possibilities of}} wheeled creatures. L. Frank Baum's 1907 children's novel Ozma of Oz features humanoid creatures with wheels instead of hands and feet, called Wheelers. Their wheels {{are composed of}} <b>keratin,</b> which has been suggested by biologists {{as a means of}} avoiding nutrient and waste transfer problems with living wheels. Despite moving quickly on open terrain, the Wheelers are stymied by obstacles in their path that do not hinder creatures with limbs, and they cannot cross sand.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{proteins}} confer {{stiffness and}} rigidity to otherwise-fluid biological components. Most structural proteins are fibrous proteins; for example, collagen and elastin are critical components of connective tissue such as cartilage, and <b>keratin</b> {{is found in}} hard or filamentous structures such as hair, nails, feathers, hooves, and some animal shells. Some globular proteins can also play structural functions, for example, actin and tubulin are globular and soluble as monomers, but polymerize to form long, stiff fibers {{that make up the}} cytoskeleton, which allows the cell to maintain its shape and size.|$|E
5|$|The bovids show great {{variation}} {{in size and}} pelage colouration. Excepting some domesticated forms, all male bovids have two or more horns, and in many species females possess horns, too. The {{size and shape of}} the horns vary greatly, but the basic structure is always one or more pairs of simple bony protrusions without branches, often having a spiral, twisted or fluted form, each covered in a permanent sheath of <b>keratin.</b> Most bovids bear 30 to 32 teeth.|$|E

40|$|Intermediate {{filaments}} {{have been}} used as cell-type-specific markers in differentiation and pathology; however, recent reports have demonstrated the coexpression of vimentin (a mesenchymal marker) and <b>keratins</b> (epithelial markers) in numerous neoplasms, including melanoma, which has been linked to metastatic disease. To test the hypothesis that coexpression of vimentin and <b>keratins</b> by melanoma cells contributes to a more migratory and invasive phenotype, we co-transfected a vimentin-positive human melanoma cell line, A 375 P (of low invasive ability), with cDNAs for <b>keratins</b> 8 and 18. The resultant stable transfectants expressed vimentin- and keratin-positive intermediate filaments showed a two- to threefold increase in their invasion of basement membrane matrix and migration through gelatin in vitro. These findings were further corroborated by video cinematography. During attachment and spreading on fibronectin, the transfectants containing vimentin and <b>keratins</b> 8 and 18 demonstrated an increase in focal adhesions that stained positive for beta 1 integrin and phosphotyrosine, along with enhanced membrane ruffling and actin stress fiber formation. From these data, we postulate that coexpression of vimentin and <b>keratins</b> results in increased cytoskeletal interactions at focal contacts within extracellular matrices involving integrin cell signaling events, which contributes to a more migratory behavior...|$|R
5|$|The {{cell lines}} of origin {{are not fully}} understood. The {{mechanism}} may involve abnormal activation of stem cells. In the proximal airways, stem cells that express <b>keratin</b> 5 {{are more likely to}} be affected, typically leading to squamous-cell lung carcinoma. In the middle airways, implicated stem cells include club cells and neuroepithelial cells that express club cell secretory protein. Small-cell lung carcinoma may be derived from these cell lines or neuroendocrine cells, and may express CD44.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known turtles {{are from}} fossils in the Upper Triassic. These fossils are nearly indistinguishable from modern turtles anatomically. In these early fossils (mostly {{of the genus}} Proganochelys), the teeth have already been lost, and a <b>keratin</b> beak {{is suggested by the}} mandibles. Important differences between Proganochelys and modern turtles are the presence of the palatal teeth (lost in modern species), the inability to retract the head within the shell, and the lack of a trochlear pulley in the jaw closing anatomy.|$|E
5|$|A rigid {{structure}} {{called the}} plica mediana or lytta {{runs from the}} front to the back, {{down the center of}} the sublingua to give it support. The plica mediana is usually made of cartilage and attaches the sublingua to the underside of the tongue. In lemuriforms, the sublingua mostly consists of two plicae fimbriatae (singular: plica fimbriata), which run along the sides of the plica mediana and end in comb-like serrated edges that are hardened with <b>keratin.</b> The plicae fimbriatae move freely over a limited range. The plica sublingualis, which is found in all primates, but is particularly small in lemuriforms, attaches the tongue and sublingua to the floor of the mouth. Tarsiers have a large but highly generalized sublingua, but their closest living relatives, monkeys and apes, lack one.|$|E
