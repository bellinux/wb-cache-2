40|$|Behavior {{of models}} of three-phase-to-single-phase rotary {{reversible}} thyristor converters of brushless synchronous compensators in a circuit simulation system is analyzed. It is shown that combined control mode of opposite-connected thyristors {{may result in}} the <b>exciter</b> <b>armature</b> winding short circuits both at the thyristor feed-forward and lagging current delay angles. It {{must be taken into}} consideration when developing brushless compensator excitation systems...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the advantages of}} laser interferometry in providing traceable vibration measurements with lowest levels of uncertainty of measurement due to which it has been established as National primary standard. The potential high precision measurements can be achieved with air bearing <b>exciters</b> of beryllium <b>armature</b> having lowest transverse motion, by special vibration isolation and by data acquisition at a high sampling rate. The national standards briefly described are mainly used for the primary calibration of reference standard accelerometers which are used in accredited calibration laboratories. Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) analysis of laser interferometer approach is discussed. The expanded measurement uncertainty (k = 2) of 0. 3 to 1. 8...|$|R
