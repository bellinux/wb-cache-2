5|$|Parallel {{to these}} {{developments}} in psychology, a philosophical behaviorism (sometimes called logical behaviorism) was developed. This {{is characterized by}} a strong verificationism, which generally considers unverifiable statements about interior mental life pointless. For the behaviorist, mental states are not interior states on which one can make introspective reports. They are just descriptions of behavior or dispositions to behave <b>in</b> <b>certain</b> <b>ways,</b> made by third parties to explain and predict another's behavior.|$|E
5|$|Some insects, {{occupying the}} {{biological}} niches that they do, {{need to be}} incredibly maneuverable. They must find their food in tight spaces and be capable of escaping larger predators – or they may themselves be predators, and need to capture prey. Their maneuverability, from an aerodynamic viewpoint, is provided by high lift and thrust forces. Typical insect fliers can attain lift forces up to three times their weight and horizontal thrust forces up to five times their weight. There are two substantially different insect flight mechanisms, and {{each has its own}} advantages and disadvantages – just because odonates have a more primitive flight mechanism does not mean they are less able fliers; they are, <b>in</b> <b>certain</b> <b>ways,</b> more agile than anything that has evolved afterward.|$|E

25|$|Another {{criticism}} regarding resilience is its definition. Like other psychological phenomena, {{by defining}} specific psychological and affective states <b>in</b> <b>certain</b> <b>ways,</b> controversy over meaning will always ensue. How the term resilience is defined affects research focuses; different or insufficient definitions of resilience {{will lead to}} inconsistent research about the same concepts. Research on resilience has become more heterogeneous in its outcomes and measures, convincing some researchers to abandon the term altogether due to it being attributed to all outcomes of research where results were more positive than expected.|$|E
25|$|Singers {{can also}} learn to project sound <b>in</b> <b>certain</b> <b>ways</b> {{so that it}} resonates better within their vocal tract. This is known as vocal resonation. Another major {{influence}} on vocal sound and production is {{the function of the}} larynx which people can manipulate in different ways to produce different sounds. These different kinds of laryngeal function are described as different kinds of vocal registers. The primary method for singers to accomplish this is through the use of the Singer's Formant; which has been shown to match particularly well to the most sensitive part of the ear's frequency range.|$|E

25|$|Apparent {{correlation}} between heredity and {{behavior may be}} due to social stereotypes making people with certain physical characteristics (which may be hereditary physical characteristics) behave <b>in</b> <b>certain</b> <b>ways,</b> without any biological link between the genetic factor and the behavior. This violatates the equal environment assumption of twin design and suggests a stronger argument for environmental influences. This factor has an especially high likelihood of being the case for behaviors that are culturally depicted in mass media as being more accepted by those who consider them to be biological than by those who consider them learned (e.g. sexuality and some psychiatric diagnoses) and for physical characteristics that are not culturally considered by mass media to be bigoted to associate with certain behaviors (e.g. not ethnic or racial). Such unequal environment biases may concentrate on {{a relatively small number of}} minor physical characteristics that are subject to stereotypes that are considered to be politically correct, with no statistically significant effect on overall ratings of physical similarity, let alone anywhere near being able to pass identical twins off as being fraternal.|$|E

[...] Price Peterson of TV.com gave a mostly negative review, writing, [...] "This episode was not the best! Not terrible by any means, but it felt lacking <b>in</b> <b>certain</b> <b>ways,</b> particularly when it came to the total lack of Piz and Dick. Where were they? Also this episode made it clear that Logan didn't have all that much to do on the show anymore." ...|$|E

Although I thought it was generally well directed, the show felt very 'wide' to me—very loose and lacking some things. A retrospective of the first season in Entertainment Weekly rated the episode a B, praising Mark Sheppard's [...] "sizzling performance", though finding that the [...] "annoying" [...] character of Phoebe Green was a detriment to the episode, who kept [...] "any real sparks from flying". Keith Phipps, writing for The A.V. Club, rated the episode a C, finding it [...] "contrived and unnecessary", and feeling that the relationship between Mulder and Phoebe Green was not believable.

500|$|Burroughs {{continued}} to publicly disagree with Long and his allies, {{and a number}} of his essays dedicated to [...] "sham nature history" [...] were collected in the volume Ways of Nature, published in late 1905. Admitting that his authorial tone had changed since 1903, he wrote in the preface that [...] "My readers will find this volume quite a departure <b>in</b> <b>certain</b> <b>ways</b> from the tone and spirit of my previous books, especially in regard to the subject of animal intelligence. Heretofore I have made the most of every gleam of intelligence of bird or four-footed beast that came under my observation, often, I fancy, making too much of it, and giving the wild creatures credit for more 'sense' than they really possessed." [...] Mabel Osgood Wright weighed in on the debate in a 1905 essay titled [...] "Nature as a Field for Fiction", in which she criticized both sides. Believing that nature writing could imbue animal characters with human qualities in order to better connect with the reader on an emotional level, Wright argued that nature writing should nonetheless strive to be factual and not fantastical.|$|E

Gyllenhaal's father, who was raised as a Swedenborgian, is of Swedish and English descent, and is a descendant of the Swedish noble Gyllenhaal family. Jake's last ancestor to be born in Sweden was his great-great-grandfather, Anders Leonard Gyllenhaal. Jake's mother is Jewish, and {{was born in}} New York City to a family from Russia and Poland. Gyllenhaal has said that he considers himself Jewish. On his 13th birthday, Gyllenhaal performed a [...] "barmitzvah-like act, without the typical trappings", volunteering at a homeless shelter because his parents wanted to give him a sense of gratitude for his privileged lifestyle. His parents insisted that he have summer jobs to support himself and he thus worked as a lifeguard and as a busboy at a restaurant operated by a family friend. Gyllenhaal said his parents encouraged artistic expression: [...] "I do have parents who constantly supported me <b>in</b> <b>certain</b> <b>ways.</b> In other ways, they were lacking. Definitely, it's in expression and creativity where my family has always been best at." ...|$|E
500|$|The travel motif is a {{recurring}} theme in Traveling Shoes, as evidenced in the book's title, but Angelou's primary motivation in living in Africa, as she told interviewer George Plimpton, was [...] "trying to get home". Angelou not only related her own journey of an African-American woman searching for a home, but the journeys of other Black expatriates at the time, whom McPherson compared to the descriptions of white expatriates in Europe in the 1920s by Ernest Hemingway and Henry James. Angelou's issues were resolved {{at the end of}} Traveling Shoes when she decided to return to America. She called her departure a [...] "second leave-taking", and compared it to the last time she left her son with his grandmother in Singin' and Swingin' when he was a child, and to the forced departure from Africa by her ancestors.
