40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{combustion}} {{and fire}} retardancy behaviour of polyacryloni-trile and its fibre-forming copolymers {{have been studied}} using the cone calorimetry technique. The <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> <b>rates</b> of the polymers are characterised by two high peaks. The first one occurs {{at the beginning of}} flaming combustion while the other occurs close to extinction. However, the initial peak is sig-nificantly reduced by the addition of comonomers such as methyl acrylate and vinyl acetate, or flame retardants such as ammonium polyphosphate. The study shows that the high initial peak during combustion is closely related to the intensive exotherm of the polymers during pyrolysis. It is suggested that the intensive exotherm leads to rapid decomposition of the polymer chains and consequently results in the high initial peak of <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> <b>rates.</b> The two selected flame retardants, ammonium polyphosphate (APP) and decabromo-diphenyl oxide (Deca) show a high efficiency in reducing the <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> <b>rates.</b> The APP mainly reduces the initial peak while Deca diminishes the last peak significantly, demonstrating two completely different retarding mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study {{focuses on}} the {{combustion}} efficiencies and further the <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> <b>rates</b> for pool fires in ceiling vented compartments. The concept of plume equivalence ratio (PER) is introduced to express the ventilation conditions for the flames in such compartments. The transient PER is estimated using the fire plume theories because the complex bi-directional vent flow {{makes it impossible to}} measure or calculate directly. The combustion efficiencies can thus be predicted utilizing the empirical correlation proposed by Tewarson, and subsequently the <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> <b>rates</b> can be decided in combination with the fuel mass loss rates. Heptane pool fires in a small-scale ceiling vented compartment were experimentally investigated. The increment of the opening size had limited impacts on the fuel mass loss rates, but significantly raised the oxygen concentrations in the compartment; however, the oxygen concentrations at the bottom began to decrease earlier. The PERs inclined with the burning procedure until extinction in general indicating the ventilation conditions for the flame grew worse; the combustion efficiencies declined correspondingly. Increasing the opening size may improve the ventilation conditions for the flame in general and consequently increase the combustion efficiencies but it seemed to have little impacts on the <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R
