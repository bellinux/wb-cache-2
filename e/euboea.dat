5|$|Athens was {{prevented}} from sending more effective aid by events on <b>Euboea</b> in 348 BC. A pre-eminent politician from Chalcis, Callias, sought {{to unite the}} cities of <b>Euboea</b> in a new confederation, inevitably meaning {{the end of the}} hitherto strong Athenian presence on the island. Strategically, this was unacceptable for the Athenians. In 410 BC, the strait between <b>Euboea</b> and the mainland, the Euripos, had been narrowed, and then bridged at Chalcis. If <b>Euboea,</b> and in particular Chalcis, was no longer controlled by Athens then Philip could potentially cross into <b>Euboea</b> from Thessaly, and then cross back into Boeotia via the bridge at Chalcis, thus outflanking Thermopylae. The whole Athenian strategy in the years after 352 BC therefore required that they hold <b>Euboea.</b>|$|E
5|$|Historians {{suggest that}} the Allies may have misinterpreted the Persian {{movements}} {{and come to the}} mistaken conclusion that the Persians were sailing east around Skiathos, aiming to sail around the eastern side of <b>Euboea.</b> The signals sent by fire beacons must have been very simplistic, and potentially interpreted wrongly; alternatively, the signallers may have genuinely believed that the Persian fleet was sailing to the east of Skiathos. If the Persians sailed around the outer, eastern side of <b>Euboea,</b> they could head straight to Attica, and thereby cut off the Allied fleet's line of retreat. Furthermore, the Persians had enough ships to attempt to both attack the Straits of Artemisium, and sail around <b>Euboea.</b> The withdrawal to Chalcis therefore gave the Allies the opportunity to escape from the Straits of <b>Euboea</b> if the Persians did travel around the outside of <b>Euboea,</b> but also allowed them to return to Artemisium if necessary. In this context, the watchers left on <b>Euboea</b> could inform the Allies if the Persian fleet did indeed sail east of <b>Euboea.</b> The Allied fleet thus continued to wait at Chalcis. Nevertheless, the Allies, undoubtedly anxious about facing a Persian fleet that so greatly outnumbered them, may have somewhat overreacted.|$|E
5|$|In early 348 BC, the Athenians were {{distracted by}} events on <b>Euboea,</b> {{and were in}} no {{position}} to send much help to Olynthos. However, the expedition the Athenians sent to <b>Euboea</b> to try to maintain their position on the island was a disaster, and the Athenians had to seek peace with Chalcis, thereby effectively losing control of the island. It is possible that Philip actually incited the revolt on <b>Euboea,</b> though it considered more likely that this is a misreading of a speech of the Athenian politician Aeschines.|$|E
5|$|During the night, another storm broke (this time {{probably}} a thunder-storm, possibly with a south easterly wind), preventing the Allies from setting off southwards {{to counter the}} Persian detachment sent around the outside of <b>Euboea.</b> However, the storm also hit the Persian detachment of ships, driving them off course and onto the rocky coast of 'the Hollows' of <b>Euboea.</b> This part of the Persian fleet was thus also shipwrecked, losing most of the ships.|$|E
5|$|Simultaneous {{with the}} battle at Thermopylae, an Allied naval force of 271 triremes defended the Straits of Artemisium against the Persians. Directly before Artemisium, the Persian fleet {{had been caught}} in a gale {{off the coast of}} Magnesia, losing many ships, but could still {{probably}} muster over 800 ships {{at the start of the}} battle. On the first day (also the first of the Battle of Thermopylae), the Persians detached 200 seaworthy ships, which were sent to sail around the eastern coast of <b>Euboea.</b> These ships were to round <b>Euboea</b> and block the line of retreat for the Allied fleet. Meanwhile, the Allies and the remaining Persians engaged in the late afternoon, the Allies having the better of the engagement and capturing 30 vessels. That evening, another storm occurred, wrecking the majority of the Persian detachment which had been sent around <b>Euboea.</b>|$|E
5|$|Again {{waiting until}} late afternoon, the Allies took the {{opportunity}} to attack a patrol of Cilician ships, destroying them, before retreating as night fell. These ships were possibly survivors of the wrecked detachment sent around <b>Euboea,</b> or were perhaps anchored in an isolated harbour.|$|E
5|$|Antigonus, who {{had brought}} with him a large force of 20,000 {{infantry}} and 1,300 cavalry, was marching through <b>Euboea</b> towards the Peloponnese. The hostile Aetolian League occupying parts of Thessaly had threatened to oppose him if he went further south than Thermopylae, despite their neutrality {{at that point in}} the war. Aratus met Antigonus at Pagae, where he was pressured by Antigonus into giving Megara to Boeotia. When Cleomenes heard of the Macedonian advance through <b>Euboea,</b> he abandoned his siege of Sicyon and constructed a trench and palisade running from Acrocorinth to the Isthmus. He chose this location to avoid facing the Macedonian phalanx head-on.|$|E
5|$|In the Ionian Islands, P.fluviatile {{is known}} to occur at only one site on Corfu, {{as well as on}} Kefalonia, Lefkada and Zakynthos. In the Aegean Islands, it is found on Skiathos and Skopelos (Sporades), on <b>Euboea</b> and Skyros, and at a single site on Andros in the Cyclades.|$|E
5|$|The Persians {{finally arrived}} off the {{southern}} tip of <b>Euboea,</b> at Karystos. The citizens of Karystos refused to give hostages to the Persians, so they were besieged, and their land ravaged, until they submitted to the Persians.|$|E
5|$|The Siege of Eretria {{took place}} in 490 BC, during the first Persian {{invasion}} of Greece. The city of Eretria, on <b>Euboea,</b> was besieged by a strong Persian force {{under the command of}} Datis and Artaphernes.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Heraclea, Attalus and Sulpicius sacked both Oreus, on the {{northern}} coast of <b>Euboea,</b> and Opus, the chief city of eastern Locris. The spoils from Oreus had been reserved for Sulpicius, who returned there, while Attalus stayed to collect the spoils from Opus. However, with their forces divided, Philip, alerted by signal fire, attacked and took Opus. Attalus, caught by surprise, was barely able to escape to his ships.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of summer, Philip and his fleet left Macedon, sailed through the Euripus Strait, between the island of <b>Euboea</b> and Boeotia on the Greek mainland, and then rounded Cape Malea, before dropping anchor off the Islands of Cephalenia and Leucas, to await word of {{the location of the}} Roman fleet. Informed that it was still at Lilybaeum, he sailed north to Apollonia in Illyria.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Artemisium, or Battle of Artemision, was {{a series}} of naval engagements over three days during the second Persian {{invasion}} of Greece. The battle took place simultaneously with the more famous land battle at Thermopylae, in August or September 480 BC, off the coast of <b>Euboea</b> and was fought between an alliance of Greek city-states, including Sparta, Athens, Corinth and others, and the Persian Empire of Xerxes I.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, {{which was}} also {{the second day of}} Battle of Thermopylae, the Persian fleet, now recovering from the two storms, declined to attack the Allies, and instead attempted to make the fleet seaworthy again. News of the shipwreck off <b>Euboea</b> reached the Allies that day, as well as a reinforcement of 53 ships from Athens.|$|E
5|$|When {{hostilities}} resumed, they sacked both Oreus, on {{the northern}} coast of <b>Euboea</b> and Opus, the chief city of eastern Locris. The spoils from Oreus had been reserved for Sulpicius, who returned there, while Attalus stayed to collect the spoils from Opus. With their forces divided, Philip attacked Opus. Attalus, caught by surprise, was barely able to escape to his ships.|$|E
5|$|After the Morea {{military}} expedition, the Greeks {{only had}} to face the Turkish troops in Central Greece. Livadeia, gateway to Boeotia, was conquered at the beginning of November 1828. A counterattack by Mahmud Pasha from <b>Euboea</b> was repulsed in January 1829. In April, Naupaktos was restored to the Greeks; in May, Augustinos Kapodistrias recaptured the symbolic town of Messolonghi. However, it took the military victory of Russia in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–29 and the Treaty of Adrianople before the independence of Greece was recognised.|$|E
5|$|After the Spartan threat {{had been}} removed, Pericles crossed back to <b>Euboea</b> {{to crush the}} revolt there. He then punished the landowners of Chalcis, who lost their properties. The {{residents}} of Histiaea, meanwhile, who had butchered the crew of an Athenian trireme, were uprooted and replaced by 2,000 Athenian settlers. The crisis was brought to an official end by the Thirty Years' Peace (winter of 446–445BC), in which Athens relinquished most of the possessions and interests on the Greek mainland which it had acquired since 460BC, and both Athens and Sparta agreed not to attempt {{to win over the}} other state's allies.|$|E
5|$|Approaching Artemisium {{towards the}} end of summer, the Persian navy was caught in a gale off the coast of Magnesia and lost around a third of their 1200 ships. After {{arriving}} at Artemisium, the Persians sent a detachment of 200 ships around the coast of <b>Euboea</b> in an attempt to trap the Greeks, but these were caught in another storm and shipwrecked. The main action of the battle took place after two days of smaller engagements. The two sides fought all day, with roughly equal losses; however, the smaller Allied fleet could not afford the losses.|$|E
5|$|At that time, {{the newly}} {{restored}} Byzantine Empire, {{under the leadership}} of Michael VIII Palaiologos, sought to recover <b>Euboea,</b> which was the major Latin insular possession in the Aegean Sea and a base for piratical activity directed against his lands. Furthermore, along with the Principality of Achaea it presented the major obstacle to his complete recovery of Greece. Already in 1269/1270, a Byzantine fleet under Alexios Doukas Philanthropenos had attacked and captured many Latin nobles, the town of Oreos.|$|E
5|$|His conquests proved {{temporary}} only, as the Byzantines were gradually evicted by the Venetians and {{the other}} Latin lords. Even in <b>Euboea,</b> Licario's major gain and personal fief, the Lombard barons managed to complete their reconquest of the entire island by 1296. Nevertheless, Licario proved {{one of the most}} successful military leaders in Michael VIII's employ, and his victories greatly enhanced the emperor's own standing and prestige amongst the Latins. The historian Deno John Geanakoplos ranks him, along with Michael's brother John Palaiologos, as the two men who caused the most damage to the Latin rulers of Greece.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{most likely}} {{realised}} that this situation presented {{them with an}} opportunity to destroy an isolated part of the Persian fleet. Herodotus is not clear on where the Allies planned to meet this detachment, only that they resolved to do so. One possibility is that they planned to sail down the Straits of <b>Euboea,</b> and hope that the other Allied ships, patrolling the coast of Attica, followed the Persians as they entered the Straits of <b>Euboea</b> from the south; then the Persians might themselves be caught in a trap. Alternatively, the Allies may have planned to ambush the detachment as it passed by Artemisium, on its journey from Aphetae. Either way, they decided to make a demonstration towards the Persian lines during what remained of the day, to convince the Persians that they were planning to stay at Artemisium. Herodotus also suggests that this was an opportunity for them to assess Persian seamanship and tactics. The Allies probably waited until late afternoon so that there was little chance of being drawn into a full scale engagement; {{they did not want to}} suffer casualties before sailing to meet to the Persian detachment. These decisions finally led to the beginning of the battle.|$|E
5|$|The French and British ambassadors had set {{themselves}} up at Poros and invited Constantinople {{to send a}} diplomat there so as to pursue negotiations over the status of Greece. The Porte persisted in refusing to participate in conferences. Hence, the French suggested continuing military operations and extending them into Attica and <b>Euboea.</b> The British opposed this plan. Thus {{it was left to}} the Greeks to drive out the Ottomans from these territories, with the understanding that the French army would only intervene if the Greeks found themselves in trouble.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} year the Persian invasion force, {{led by the}} Persian king in person, had scored victories at the battles of Thermopylae and Artemisium and conquered Thessaly, Boeotia, <b>Euboea</b> and Attica. However, at the ensuing Battle of Salamis, the Allied Greek navy had won an unlikely but decisive victory, preventing the conquest of the Peloponnesus. Xerxes then retreated with much of his army, leaving his general Mardonius to finish off the Greeks the following year.|$|E
5|$|The {{task force}} sailed on to <b>Euboea,</b> {{and to the}} first major target, Eretria. The Eretrians {{made no attempt to}} stop the Persians from landing or {{advancing}} and thus allowed themselves to be besieged. For six days, the Persians attacked the walls, with losses on both sides; however, on the seventh day two reputable Eretrians opened the gates and betrayed the city to the Persians. The city was razed, and temples and shrines were looted and burned. Furthermore, according to Darius's commands, the Persians enslaved all the remaining townspeople.|$|E
5|$|William, {{moving quickly}} {{in support of}} his own claims, had already seized Negroponte. Gradenigo and his Venetians {{attacked}} and took the city, but William responded by sending his nephew the baron of Karytaina, Geoffroy de Bruyères, who recaptured Negroponte and launched devastating raids in <b>Euboea.</b> Venice then laid siege to the city, which dragged on for thirteen months until its defenders capitulated in early 1258. An Achaean counterattack was repulsed by Venetian infantry sallying forth and defeating the famed Achaean cavalry before the city's walls.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Athens orchestrated the {{creation}} of an alliance with <b>Euboea,</b> Megara, Achaea, Corinth, Acarnania and other states in the Peloponnese. However the most desirable ally for Athens was Thebes. To secure their allegiance, Demosthenes was sent, by Athens, to the Boeotian city; Philip also sent a deputation, but Demosthenes succeeded in securing Thebes's allegiance.* K. Tsatsos, Demosthenes, 284–285; H. Weil, Biography of Demosthenes, 41–42. Demosthenes' oration before the Theban people is not extant and, therefore, the arguments he used to convince the Thebans remain unknown. In any case, the alliance came at a price: Thebes's control of Boeotia was recognised, Thebes was to command solely on land and jointly at sea, and Athens was to pay two thirds of the campaign's cost.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey married Isabella de la Roche, {{daughter}} of the Great Lord of Athens and Thebes, Guy I de la Roche. In 1256–58, he {{became involved in the}} War of the Euboeote Succession, at first as a lieutenant of his uncle, Prince William II of Villehardouin, leading an army that laid waste to <b>Euboea</b> and recovered the town of Negroponte for the Prince. Later, however, he sided with his father-in-law Guy de la Roche and the other Frankish lords who opposed William's hegemonic ambitions. William however prevailed in the Battle of Karydi in 1258, and a parliament was assembled at Nikli to judge the defeated lords. Geoffrey was pardoned by the Prince and his confiscated lands returned, but this time as a personal grant, rather than a fief held in right of conquest.|$|E
5|$|In 1276, {{following}} their great {{victory over the}} Lombard triarchs of Negroponte at the Battle of Demetrias, the Byzantines renewed their offensive in <b>Euboea.</b> Licario attacked his native Karystos, seat of the southern triarchy, and took it, after a long siege, in the same year. For this success, he was rewarded by Michael VIII with the whole island as a fief, and a noble Greek wife with a rich dowry. In turn, Licario pledged to provide 200 knights to the Emperor. Gradually, Licario reduced the Latin strongholds on the island, until, by 1278, he had seized {{almost all of it}} except for the capital, the city of Negroponte (Chalkis).|$|E
5|$|Later on that day, a deserter {{from the}} Persian fleet, a Greek called Scyllias, swam into the Allied camp. He brought {{bad news for}} the Allies — whilst most of the Persian fleet was {{undergoing}} repairs, the Persians had detached 200 seaworthy ships to sail around the outer coast of <b>Euboea,</b> to block the escape route of the Allied fleet. The Persians did not want to attack the Allies yet, because they thought the Allies would simply flee, and so they sought to trap them. The Allies resolved to go and meet this detachment, to prevent being trapped, though they planned to leave by nightfall to prevent the Persians becoming aware of their plans.|$|E
5|$|Licario {{was born}} in Karystos in Latin-held <b>Euboea</b> (Negroponte), from a Vicentian father and a local woman. He was of humble origin, but able and ambitious. Serving as a knight under the Latin triarch Giberto II da Verona, he managed to win the heart of Felisa, sister of Giberto and widow of another triarch, Narzotto dalle Carceri. The match was met with disapproval by Felisa's family. They {{secretly}} married, but the marriage was cancelled by her relatives. Fleeing from their wrath, Licario sought refuge in the fort of Anemopylae near Cavo D'Oro. He repaired the strong fortress, assembled {{a small group of}} followers, and began raiding the surrounding estates, belonging to the island's nobles.|$|E
5|$|Once the Ionian revolt {{was finally}} {{crushed by the}} Persian victory at the Battle of Lade, Darius began to plan to subjugate Greece. In 490 BC, he sent a naval task force under Datis and Artaphernes across the Aegean to subjugate the Cyclades, and then to make punitive attacks on Athens and Eretria. Reaching <b>Euboea</b> in mid-summer after a {{successful}} campaign in the Aegean, the Persians proceeded to put Eretria under siege. The siege lasted six days before a fifth column of Eretrian nobles betrayed {{the city to the}} Persians. The city was plundered, and the population enslaved on Darius's orders. The Eretrian prisoners were eventually taken to Persia and settled as colonists in Cissia.|$|E
5|$|Strategically, the Allied {{mission was}} simple. The fleet {{needed to protect}} the flank of the army at Thermopylae, whilst not being cut off themselves. For the Persians, the {{strategic}} situation was equally simple, although with more options. They needed to force their way through either one of Thermopylae or Artemisium (since holding both was necessary for the Allied effort), or to outflank either position. Outflanking the Straits of Artemisium was theoretically much easier than outflanking Thermopylae, by sailing around {{the east coast of}} <b>Euboea.</b> The Greek position at Artemisium may have been chosen in order to watch for such attempts. If narrowness of the channel had been the only determinant, the Allies could have found a better position near the city of Histiaea.|$|E
5|$|The {{task force}} then sailed around <b>Euboea</b> {{to the first}} major target, Eretria. According to Herodotus, the Eretrians were divided amongst {{themselves}} as to {{the best course of}} action; whether to flee to the highlands, or undergo a siege, or to submit to the Persians. In the event, the majority decision was to remain in the city. The Eretrians made no attempt to stop the Persians landing, or advancing, and thus allowed themselves to be besieged. For six days the Persians attacked the walls, with losses on both sides; however, on the seventh day two reputable Eretrians opened the gates and betrayed the city to the Persians. The city was razed, and temples and shrines were looted and burned. Furthermore, according to Darius's commands, the Persians enslaved all the remaining townspeople.|$|E
5|$|Therefore, {{the first}} Persian {{invasion}} of Greece effectively {{began in the}} following year, 492 BC, when Mardonius was dispatched (via Ionia) to complete the pacification of the land approaches to Greece and push on to Athens and Eretria if possible. Thrace was re-subjugated, having broken loose from Persian rule during the revolts and Macedon compelled to become a vassal of Persia. However, progress was halted by a naval disaster. A second expedition was launched in 490 BC under Datis and Artaphernes, son of the satrap Artaphernes. This amphibious force sailed across the Aegean, subjugating the Cyclades, before arriving off <b>Euboea.</b> Eretria was besieged, captured and destroyed, and the force then moved onto Attica. Landing at the Bay of Marathon, they were met by an Athenian army and defeated in the famous Battle of Marathon, ending the first Persian attempt to subdue Greece.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the battle, Sparta and Athens were the two largest city-states in Greece. Once the Ionian revolt was finally crushed by the Persian victory at the Battle of Lade in 494 BC, Darius began plans to subjugate Greece. In 490 BC, he sent a naval task force under Datis and Artaphernes across the Aegean, to subjugate the Cyclades, and then to make punitive attacks on Athens and Eretria. Reaching <b>Euboea</b> in mid-summer after a {{successful}} campaign in the Aegean, the Persians proceeded to besiege and capture Eretria. The Persian force then sailed for Attica, landing in the bay near the town of Marathon. The Athenians, joined by a small force from Plataea, marched to Marathon, and succeeded in blocking the two exits from the plain of Marathon. The Athenians also sent a message asking for support to the Spartans. When the messenger arrived in Sparta, the Spartans were involved in a religious festival and gave this as a reason for not coming to aid of the Athenians.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1821 Mr. Leeves of the BFBS visited Thessaloniki to {{supervise}} the translation. On February 8, 1821 he wrote that the work had been completed, {{and that the only}} outstanding task was a final review by a competent person, who had already been assigned to the task. In 1822 the revised manuscript was sent to Malta to be printed, and in 1823 Leeves sent from Malta to the representative of the society in Corfu the first copy of a printed New Testament in Albanian. Meanwhile, the New Testament had had a final revision performed by the Archimandrite of <b>Euboea,</b> Grigor Gjirokastriti, an Albanian who subsequently became Archbishop Gregory IV of Athens. Archimandrite Grigor had recommended that the Bible be printed in a large typeface in two columns, one in Albanian and the other in modern Greek, because Albanians would rather read modern Greek than Koine.|$|E
