40|$|A {{large scale}} spatio-temporally {{periodic}} disturbance was excited in a {{turbulent boundary layer}} via a wall-actuated dynamic roughness. Streamwise velocity, wall pressure, and direct wall shear stress measurements were made with a <b>hot</b> <b>wire,</b> pressure <b>microphone,</b> and a micro-scale differential capacitive sensor, respectively. Phase-averaged fields for the three quantities were calculated and analyzed. A phase calibration between the various sensors was performed with an acoustic plane wave tube over a range of operating conditions to validate a direct phase comparison between the respective quantities. Results suggest encouraging agreement between the phase of the wall shear stress and velocity near the wall; however, more refined velocity measurements are needed to make quantitative comparisons to the wall pressure. Overall, this work highlights the potential for wall-based control with applications towards reducing turbulent drag...|$|R
40|$|The {{acoustical}} excitation of shear layers is investigated. Acoustical excitation {{causes the}} so-called orderly structures in shear layers and jets. Also, the deviations in the spreading rate between different shear layer experiments {{are due to}} the same excitation mechanism. Measurements in the linear interaction region {{close to the edge}} from which the shear layer is shed are examined. Two sets of experiments (Houston 1981 and Berlin 1983 / 84) are discussed. The measurements were carried out with shear layers in air using <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> anemometers and <b>microphones.</b> The agreement between these measurements and the theory is good. Even details of the fluctuating flow field correspond to theoretical predictions, such as the local occurrence of negative phase speeds...|$|R

40|$|The {{principle}} {{reasons for}} using the <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> type of anemometer for turbulence measurements are outlined {{and some of the}} objectionable features limiting the applicability of the conventional type anemometer are pointed out. A brief historical background of the <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> anemometer is followed by a consideration of various possibilities of improving the method of measuring the intensity of turbulence.

40|$|The <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> method, with pH and {{temperature}} sensors, was evaluated {{to determine its}} usefulness and application for cheese production automation. Coagulation of milk substrate was measured with the <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> instrument and by four other methods: Formagraph, Brookfield®, vixcometer, Omnispec™ bioactivity monitor, and Sommer and Matsen rolling bottle method. The <b>hot</b> <b>wire,</b> using the time at maximum slope, detected coagulation before methods that measure resistance to shear, and after methods that measure light reflectance. Coagulation time was {{not significantly different from}} the industry standard rolling bottle method used by Sommer and Matsen. the <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> instrument was also used to distinguish samples that formed curd at different rates. This was accomplished by measuring the rate of temperature change of the <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> probe during curd formation. Milk samples of varying protein, fat, and calcium concentrations were prepared to determine if the instrument could be used to predict a consistent curd cut-point. The pH level was also adjusted, and rennet additions were varied. Coagulation was monitored simultaneously with the <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> system and a Formagraph. All five factors (pH, calcium, fat, protein, and rennet) had significant effects on cut time estimations (CT 20) on the Formagraph. Linear correlations (R 2) ranging from. 74 to. 94 were obtained using stepwise regressions when comparing <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> and compositional data with the Formagraph. A Formagraph was used to measure effects of calcium, pH, and rennet changes on the coagulation properties of late lactation milk. Calcium, pH, and rennet treatments significantly affected the coagulation parameters measured by the Formagraph. However, response among the poor coagulating samples to treatments to improve coagulation was sample dependent. General composition and SDS-PAGE fractionation data could not be used as an indicator of poor or good coagulability of samples. The <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> method worked well for monitoring coagulation time and curd firming rate, but did not measure maximum curd firmness well. Curd firming rates determined from the <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> data are acceptable for estimation of a curd cut time. Added benefits of the <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> method for monitoring cheese manufacture are that stirring, coagulation, and healing of curd can also be measured. Therefore, the rates of change of important parameters, such as pH, temperature, and coagulation during critical processing steps, can easily be determined by a computer and displayed, printed out, or saved for future evaluation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{new method}} {{to measure the}} thermal {{conductivity}} of a single fine fibre is proposed. The method {{is based on the}} heat transfer phenomena of a pin fin attached to a short <b>hot</b> <b>wire.</b> The short <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> is supplied with a constant direct current to generate a uniform heat flux and both its ends are connected to lead wires and maintained at the initial temperature. The test fibre is attached as a pin fin to the centre position of the <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> at one end and the other end is connected to a heat sink. One-dimensional steady-state heat conduction along the <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> and the test fibre is analytically solved. From the solutions, the relationships among the average temperature rise of the <b>hot</b> <b>wire,</b> the heat generation rate, the temperature at the attached end of the fibre, and heat flux from the <b>hot</b> <b>wire</b> to the fibre are accurately obtained. Based on the relationships, the thermal conductivity of the single test fibre can easily be estimated when the average temper-ature rise and the heat generation rate are measured for the same system as above. We have obtained analytical solutions for various measurement conditions and clarified quantitatively the applicability and accuracy of this method. It is found that the thermal conductivity can be measured within an error of 1 % in the range up to 1000 W mÿ 1 Kÿ 1 for a fibre of 10 ^ 30 mm in diameter. Furthermore, preliminary experiments have been carried out with samples of platinum wire (100. 8 mm diameter) and copper wire (41. 7 mm diameter), and confirmed the validity of the present method. ...|$|R
