5|$|In March, {{hundreds}} {{of political prisoners}} were freed, with Gaddafi falsely claiming {{that there were no}} further political prisoners in Libya. In June, Libya's government issued the Great <b>Green</b> <b>Charter</b> on Human Rights in the Era of the Masses, in which 27 articles laid out goals, rights and guarantees to improve the situation of human rights in Libya, restricting the use of the death penalty and calling for its eventual abolition. Many of the measures suggested in the charter would be implemented the following year, although others remained inactive. Also in 1989, the government founded the Al-Gaddafi International Prize for Human Rights, to be awarded to figures from the Third World who had struggled against colonialism and imperialism; the first year's winner was South African anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela. From 1994 through to 1997, the government initiated cleansing committees to root out corruption, particularly in the economic sector.|$|E

2500|$|From 1969 to 2011, {{the history}} of Libya was marked by the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (where jamahiriya means [...] "state of the masses"), a [...] "direct democracy" [...] {{political}} system established by Muammar Gaddafi, who nominally stepped down from power in 1977, but remained an unofficial [...] "Brother Leader" [...] until 2011. Under the Jamahiriya, the country's literacy rate rose to 90%, and welfare systems were introduced that allowed access to free education, free healthcare, and financial assistance for housing. In 2008, the General People's Congress has declared the Great <b>Green</b> <b>Charter</b> of Human Rights of the Jamahiriyan Era. The Great Manmade River was also built to allow free access to fresh water across {{large parts of the}} country. In addition, illiteracy and homelessness had been [...] "almost wiped out," [...] and financial support was provided for university scholarships and employment programs, while {{the nation as a whole}} remained debt-free. As a result, Libya's Human Development Index in 2010 was the highest in Africa and greater than that of Saudi Arabia.|$|E

50|$|At the 2001 Canberra Global Gathering delegates for Green Parties from 72 {{countries}} decided upon a Global <b>Greens</b> <b>Charter</b> which proposes six key principles.
