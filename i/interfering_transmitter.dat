50|$|Near end {{crosstalk}} (NEXT): NEXT is {{a measure}} of the ability of cabling to reject crosstalk. Interference between two pairs in a cable is measured at the same end of the cable as the <b>interfering</b> <b>transmitter.</b> Crosstalk is undesirable. In crosstalk, the signals traveling through adjacent pairs of wire in twisted-pair cabling interfere with each other. The pair causing the interference is called the “disturbing pair,” while the pair experiencing the interference is the “disturbed pair.” Channel NEXT is the NEXT value measured between one wire pair and another in the same cable; NEXT is measured at both ends of the wire. The NEXT value for a given cable type is generally expressed in decibels per feet or decibels per 1000 feet. NEXT value varies with the frequency of transmission. The higher the NEXT value, the greater the cable’s ability to reject crosstalk at its local connection. Generally specifications for cabling (such as CAT 5) include the minimum NEXT values.|$|E

Specifically, results shown in this section are with ACI, and results shown in Section 3 are without ACI. The simulation parameters are specified in Table  1, if not otherwise indicated. To {{examine the effects of}} ACI on a given receiver, consider two transmitters: one transmitter is desired and generates the desired signal, and the other transmitter is not desired and generates ACI. Presented in this section are the following three scenarios. In the first scenario, the reference receiver belongs to a PU, the desired transmitter belongs to another PU, and the <b>interfering</b> <b>transmitter</b> belongs to a SU. In the second scenario, the reference receiver belongs to a SU, the desired transmitter belongs to another SU, and the <b>interfering</b> <b>transmitter</b> belongs to a PU.

30|$|The metrics for {{evaluating}} {{the performance of the}} HetNet are directly related to the SINR on links. The SINR depends on many factors such as the distance between the desired transmitter and the desired receiver, and the set of <b>interfering</b> <b>transmitters</b> and their distances from the desired receiver [14]. The SINR is considered in this work by applying Equations (1) and (2) from Section 2, respectively.|$|R

30|$|As {{shown in}} [4, 5], the {{fundamental}} {{origin of the}} interchannel interference lies in the unavoidable non-smoothness in the modulation of the <b>interfering</b> <b>transmitter,</b> which leads to discontinuities in the higher order derivatives of the modulating signal. This non-smoothness is exacerbated by the non-idealities in the hardware implementation, and by the coupling of other interfering signals from the adjacent circuitry.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. Interference of satellite communications {{is a frequent}} and ongoing concern for both DoD and civilian enterprises. Geolocation of the interfering source is an essential step in mitigating or eliminating the interference and restoring operation of the communications service. Existing techniques to locate sources of such interference are not applicable to newer satellite communications systems. This thesis offers an innovative method for locating interference that takes advantage of modern multi-antenna satellites. The location of a source of radio frequency interference can be determined by comparing the received signal strength across multiple antennas on the same satellite. The difference between signal strength'as received by the satellite antennas'can be computed and plotted as lines of position {{on the surface of}} the Earth. The intersection of two or more lines of position represents the location of the <b>interfering</b> <b>transmitter.</b> An advantage of this method is that it is completely passive and can be done in real time. The size and accuracy of the resultant geolocation area are a function of a number of different factors, including terrestrial latitude of the <b>interfering</b> <b>transmitter,</b> the accuracy of the signal strength measurement, and the geometry of the intersecting lines of position.

40|$|The {{best known}} inner {{bound for the}} 2 -user {{discrete}} memoryless interference channel is the Han-Kobayashi rate region. The coding schemes that achieve this region are based on rate-splitting and superposition coding. In this paper, we develop a multicoding scheme {{to achieve the same}} rate region. A key advantage of the multicoding nature of the proposed coding scheme is that it can be naturally extended to more general settings, such as when encoders have state information or can overhear each other. In particular, we extend our coding scheme to characterize the capacity region of the state-dependent deterministic Z-interference channel when noncausal state information is available at the <b>interfering</b> <b>transmitter.</b> We specialize our results to the case of the linear deterministic model with on/off interference which models a wireless system where a cognitive transmitter is noncausally aware of the times it interferes with a primary transmission. For this special case, we provide an explicit expression for the capacity region and discuss some interesting properties of the optimal strategy.

Therefore, the measurements have been conducted in an environment where the interference has been limited, and the carrier frequency and the receiver gain were kept constant.|$|E

However, this would permit part of a subframe from an <b>interfering</b> <b>transmitter</b> to interfere with part of another subframe at the receiver, and the complications for analysis would be too much. To simplify the interference scenario, we would not account for, or model, any interference by partially overlapping subframes. In other words, if a subframe partially overlaps another subframe, it is assumed to overlap completely. This {{is equivalent to the}} 'subframe-synchronized but frame-asynchronous’ assumption.|$|E

These novel results provide valuable insights for the design of future ad hoc networks.

By this, we mean that, first, the receivers make no attempt to decode and subtract the received interference from K− 1 APs to get their desired signal. Second, {{the only way to get}} rid of collision of signals at the receivers in our system model is by preventing the interferences reaching the receivers. The main justification for this assumption is that, in most envisioned MU-MIMO WLAN applications, clients would use receivers with a simple architecture. Additionally, in a dynamic environment of WLANs, interference subtraction is difficult as the receivers do not know the coding and modulation schemes used by the <b>interfering</b> <b>transmitters.</b>|$|R
