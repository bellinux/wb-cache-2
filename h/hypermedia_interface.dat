40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss a {{distributed}} user model architecture suitable for hypermedia systems. In this architecture, the user knowledge is spread over a collection of autonomous actors, cooperating in a way which provides, through collaborative activities, a global, dynamic user model. Separate duties and knowledge, combined with asynchronous and concurrent processing, augment the adaptivity and the e�ciency of the platform, avoiding the drawbacks of more traditional centralized approaches. Our goal was to enrich an existing hypermedia architecture with an appropriate user model activity, conceived and realized with the same design perspective of the underlying system, the actor-level design approach. The organizational structure has been de�ned by extending a previous hypermedia system model without redesigning the overall architecture. The prototype hasbeen tested withsuccess as an adaptive <b>hypermedia</b> <b>interface</b> inalogic objectoriented programming environment. ...|$|E

In this paper we present a conversational metaphor to try to ameliorate this problem. We propose a framework in which the interaction is rendered using 3 D sound. Several voices used as media to convey information are placed in the space through this technology. By using a glove the user controls the system manipulating a special version of 3 D auditory icons, called audicons. Moreover, we introduce a technique called grab-and-drop, equivalent to the visual drag-and-drop. We show that this framework permits the building and adaptation of current <b>hypermedia</b> <b>interfaces</b> in a way that can be used without visual cues.

40|$|Communication is {{virtually}} impossible when interlocutors lack the ability to negotiate meanings. The intended semantics of the language used by a sender should be perceived and mastered by its receiver/s. For this reason the sender should always vision and identify himself in the receiver in order to design the most clear and proper signs with respect to her/his knowledge. Web sites are complex interactive communication tools. In order to let users manage and control their content and services, they make use of different languages, different families of signs involving different sets of knowledge that the user should be somehow familiar with. Web designers (senders) should design interface signs so that their intended meaning could be correctly interpreted by the envisioned users (receivers). This work presents a novel approach for analyzing {{the different kinds of}} signs composing web interfaces and better understanding their relationship with the process of user’s understanding. Starting from Linguistic/Semiotic theories and key achievements in <b>Hypermedia</b> <b>Interface</b> Design, this research developed a semiotic framework (W-SIDE Framework) for analyzing and evaluating the user’s understanding of the interface language of web applications. W-SIDE Framework comprises a conceptual toolkit (W-SIDE Model) and an evaluation technique (W-SIDE Evaluation Technique) for modeling and evaluating the clarity of web interface language with respect to critic user profiles. W-SIDE represents a useful conceptual tool supporting web interface design and evaluation, by making experts aware of potential user misunderstandings caused by a gap between the knowledge presupposed by web signs and the one owned by targeted users. The empirical validation of the framework has been carried out in two ways. Firstly, the method has been employed in web projects on the field. The results obtained from analyzing and evaluating web applications through W-SIDE have been compared with the ones obtained from observing real users while interacting with the same applications, in order to check the reliability of the method. Secondly, the framework has been constantly reviewed by experts from both the linguistic/semiotic and the web design field: the feedback gathered is encouraging for further improvements...|$|E

Introduction: In the present paper we will seek to place the design of hypermedia-based user interfaces in the appropriate context of user-centred system design.

As this will indicate, we view hypermedia design as essentially no different from any other kind interface design in terms of process and problem. Hence the methodological issues for <b>hypermedia</b> <b>interfaces</b> need to be seen as design problems rather than cognitive scientific ones.

40|$|Abnormal Situation Management (ASM) {{involves}} the timely detection, diagnosis and correction of abnormal process conditions. Industrial statistics estimate {{the economic impact}} due to abnormal situations to be about 20 billion/year in the U. S. petrochemical industries alone. Process fault diagnosis, which forms {{the first step in}} ASM, deals with detection and analysis of the root causes of abnormal behaviors. Although modern control systems achieve a high degree of automation, the process operator still has the overall responsibility for the safe and economic operation of the process, including process fault diagnosis. Diagnostic problem solving forms a major part of an operator 2 ̆ 7 s activities in complex chemical processes. It cannot be overemphasized that training operators on fault diagnosis and ASM will help minimize process upsets, and thereby improve the reliability and safety of the plant. However, current practices in operator training for ASM, in general, are quite inadequate in a number of aspects, thus necessitating the development for more effective alternative approaches. ^ Towards that goal, a novel Process Operator Intelligent Training System (POINTS) framework has been presented in this thesis. This intelligent tutoring environment is composed of an interactive, dynamic simulation of a chemical process plant, a computer model of expert operators, an intelligent computer-based tutor and trainee model that allow for automatic evaluation and coaching of the trainees in order to improve their diagnostic skills, and suitable graphical user interfaces. Causal models of the process are represented as diagraph models. To make the training system more effective, the process-related information/explanations including digraph-based symptom-cause relationships are supplied through intelligent <b>hypermedia</b> <b>interface.</b> It helps operators to organize system knowledge and operational information including causal relationships. ^ Specific training applications were developed for a CSTR case study and the AMOCO Model IV FCCU plant. These establish the feasibility of implementing integrated intelligent training programs as POINTS applications. This demonstrates the possibility of using general-purpose toolkit modules to design and configure flexible systems which are relatively easy to use and support. Possibilities of using this system as an on-line assistant of process operators and for the training of remedial actions are also discussed. ...|$|E
40|$|Increasingly {{the use of}} Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in {{teaching}} and learning has become a key focus of educational research. However, the effective use of ICTs in education depends on various factors of performance and context which are not always effectively recognized by the traditional delineation between quantitative and qualitative research methodologies. In other words, research about ICT-related tools, programs, methods and imperatives in education often involve or require new and changing notions of an effective design, evaluation, and implementation stages or processes of research. Likewise, there is a related need to re-visit and distinguish the 'constants' of effective research (e. g. the construction and refinement of a relevant and focused research problem or question) in changing times whatever the methodological approach taken. This presentation will thus explore some of the issues, requirements and possibilities of doing educational research involving ICTs in changing times. Dr. Cameron Richards is a lecturer at the Singapore National Institute of Education whose recent teaching, research and publications have revolved around the practical as well as conceptual/theoretical problem of integrating in education the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) exemplified by the internet. Over the last seven years in two countries he has designed, developed and coordinated innovative ICT-related courses in various modes of 'e-learning' which have been well-received by students. In terms of his PhD and Masters dissertation supervision as well as his own research projects, he has been particularly interested in the challenge of designing effective research methodologies for ICT integration in education - that is, inquiries which retain connections to concrete, performative, and problem-based contexts of application. He has also presented and published widely on related topics such as performative action research, project/problem-based learning, an appropriate ICT learning model, a theory of the <b>hypermedia</b> <b>interface,</b> and an integrated approach to e-learning. His recent articles have been published in journals such as Teaching and Learning, Education and Computers, Language Learning and Technology, and Educational Technology.

40|$|Current {{hypermedia}} modeling {{techniques such}} as OOHDM, RMM or WebML rely on class-based domain models to guide the hypermedia construction process. In this paper we discuss the notion of role-oriented models as particularly suited for capturing different semantic contexts of <b>hypermedia</b> <b>interfaces.</b> The key idea is to allow resources to fill different roles which specify how these resources can be embedded in different link structures. After an overview of some class-oriented models, we discuss in detail the main features and benefits of role-oriented modeling compared to conventional class-oriented approaches, and make clear the distinction between attributes and links associated with objects via their natural types and attributes and relationships for an object specified by the different roles the object can fill. Two detailed examples, one discussing the use of role-oriented models for the specification of link structures in learning materials, another one for the specification of contexts for a tourist information system, show how these role-oriented models can be applied in different areas. Finally we show how such models can be easily expressed and implemented using the W 3 C standard for web annotation, RDFS, and show that a role-oriented semantics is actually closer to the intended use of RDFS schemas than the "default" class-oriented semantics...|$|R

Examples will be taken from a museum hypermedia we are currently developing in co-operation with the Poldi Pezzoli Museum in Milano. Multimedia and hypermedia can have a potentially enormous exploitation in museums, addressing different categories of users and serving {{for a variety of}} purposes.
