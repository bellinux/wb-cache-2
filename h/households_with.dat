40|$|Suicide {{rates are}} higher {{among those who}} own a handgun and among {{those who live in}} a <b>household</b> <b>with</b> a handgun. The present {{investigation}} examined the association between gun ownership and mental health, another risk factor for suicide. Data from the General Social Survey, a series of surveys of U. S. adults, were analyzed to compare general emotional and mental health, sadness and depression, functional mental health, and mental health help seeking among gun owners, persons who do not own their own gun but reside in a <b>household</b> <b>with</b> a gun, {{and those who do not}} own a gun. After taking into account a few basic demographic characteristics associated with both variables, there appears to be no association between mental health and gun ownership. Nor is there any association between mental health and living in a <b>household</b> <b>with</b> a firearm. Findings suggest that the high risk of suicide among those who own or live in a <b>household</b> <b>with</b> a gun is not related to poor mental health.

5|$|Robert Frank, a {{professor}} of child development at Oakton Community College in Illinois, conducted a study comparing <b>households</b> <b>with</b> a stay-at-home dad and <b>households</b> <b>with</b> a stay-at-home mom. His study concluded that women were still able to form a strong bond with their children despite working full-time outside the home. Also, women working full-time were often more engaged with their children {{on a day-to-day basis}} than their male counterparts. His study concluded that in a family with a stay-at-home dad arrangement, the maternal and paternal influences are equally strong. This contrasts with the more traditional family structure where the father works outside the home and the mother stays home with the children. In this type of arrangement, the mother's influence is extremely strong, whereas the father's is relatively small. The study found that both parents play an equal role in a child's development, but the stay-at-home dad arrangement is the most beneficial for the child.|$|E
