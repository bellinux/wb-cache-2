5|$|Babrak Karmal (Dari/, born Sultan Hussein; 6 January 1929 – 1 or 3 December 1996) was an Afghan {{politician}} who was installed {{as president of}} Afghanistan by the USSR when they invaded in 1979. Karmal was born in Kamari and educated at Kabul University. When the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) was formed, Karmal became one of its leading members, having been introduced to Marxism by Mir Akbar Khyber during his imprisonment <b>for</b> <b>activities</b> deemed too radical by the government. He eventually became {{the leader of the}} Parcham faction. When the PDPA split in 1967, the Parcham-faction established a Parcham PDPA, while their ideological nemesis, the Khalqs, established a Khalqist PDPA. Under Karmal's leadership, the Parchamite PDPA participated in Mohammad Daoud Khan's rise to power, and his subsequent regime. While relations were good at the beginning, Daoud began a major purge of leftist influence in the mid-1970s. This in turn led to the reformation of the PDPA in 1977. The PDPA took power in the 1978 Saur Revolution.|$|E

5|$|Boyce was a multi-millionaire by {{the early}} 1900s and by 1909 became more {{interested}} in civic affairs and less in finance. He also began to travel, often as part of hunting expeditions. He leased hunting lodges at Fort Sisseton, South Dakota, where he had hunted as a young man. He often hosted friends and relatives, especially his son, <b>for</b> <b>activities</b> such as hunting, fishing, dinner, poker, and plentiful liquor. These changes {{may have been in}} part caused by the destruction of his Ottawa mansion by fire in early 1908, which was soon rebuilt, followed three months later by the sale of his Marseilles paper mill due to a new law that prevented railroads from negotiating with shippers, and his September 1908 announcement that he and his wife, Mary Jane, were separating.|$|E
5|$|Full-time National Serviceman Muhammad Fadil Abdul Hamid was {{detained}} on 4 April 2010. He {{was described by}} the media as self-radicalized, having been deeply influenced by the lectures of Feiz Mohammad and Anwar al-Aulaqi which he had accessed online. Around this time, two other people influenced by al-Aulaqi were placed under restriction orders. Between January and July 2011, three Muslim radicals were deported to Singapore from other countries and detained. JI members Jumari bin Kamdi and Samad bin Subari were arrested in Malaysia and Indonesia respectively; while Abdul Majid s/o Kunji Mohammad, {{a member of the}} Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), was arrested in Malaysia. As of 13 September 2011, there were 17 people on orders of detention, one whose detention had been suspended, and 49 people on restriction orders.

5|$|Rachel Barrett (12 November 1874 – 26 August 1953) was a suffragette and {{newspaper}} editor born in Carmarthen, Wales. After attending the University College of Wales in Aberystwyth {{she became a}} science teacher. In 1906 she quit her job after hearing Nellie Martel speak on women's suffrage; she then {{became a member of}} the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) and moved to London. In 1907 she became an organiser for the WSPU and after Christabel Pankhurst fled to Paris, Barrett was asked to be the joint organiser of the national WSPU campaign. In 1912, despite having no journalistic background, she was put in charge of the newly formed newspaper The Suffragette. Barrett was arrested on more than one occasion <b>for</b> <b>activities</b> linked to the suffrage movement and between 1913 and 1914 she spent time incognito avoiding re-arrest.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In modern {{manufacturing}} {{systems like}} multi-resource constrained project scheduling {{problem with the}} multiple modes (mcPSP-mM) is complicated because of the complex interrelationships between the units of the different stages. In this paper, we develop an adaptive genetic algorithm (aGA) to solve the mcPSP-mM which is a well known NP-hard problem. A new aGA algorithm approach for solving these mcPSP-mM problems is 1) the design of priority-based encoding <b>for</b> <b>activity</b> priority and multistage-based encoding <b>for</b> <b>activity</b> mode, 2) order-based crossover operator <b>for</b> <b>activity</b> priority and local search-based mutation operator <b>for</b> <b>activity</b> mode, 3) iterative hill-climbing method in GA loop, 4) auto-tuning for the rates of crossover and mutation operators. The numerical experiments show that the proposed aGA is effective to the mcPSP-mM. Keywords: Multi-resource constrained, Project scheduling problem, Multiple modes, Adaptive genetic algorithm 1.

In addition to their strong claws and feet, woodpeckers have short, strong legs. This is typical of birds that regularly forage on trunks. Exceptions are the black-backed woodpecker and the American and Eurasian three-toed woodpeckers, which have only three toes on each foot. The tails of all woodpeckers, except the piculets and wrynecks, are stiffened, and when the bird perches on a vertical surface, the tail and feet work together to support it.|$|E
