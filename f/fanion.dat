25|$|During {{the early}} morning of 16 April 1917 the Nivelle Offensive was launched. In the sector where the tanks {{operated}} the initial waves of French infantry succeeded in taking {{the first and second}} German trenches as planned, but with very heavy losses. The French artillery was insufficient in number to simultaneously sustain the creeping barrage and suppress the numerous German artillery batteries. This was aggravated by the German air superiority which allowed artillery observation planes to precisely direct German interdiction fire on the advancing French columns. Groupement Chaubès suffered many losses before it was even able to leave the French lines. When arriving at the frontline in the early afternoon, it had to assist the infantry in clearing the second trench of the last German remnants. These did not panic {{at the sight of the}} French tanks but had been trained to hide from them, leaving their cover to engage the French infantry when the armoured vehicles had moved on. At the end of the day, the French infantry proved unable to continue the offensive and the last surviving French tanks had to be withdrawn. More to the east, north of Berry-au-Bac after which village later the entire tank action would be named, Groupement Bossut proved more successful. It managed to cross the various trench lines losing only a few vehicles and in the late morning concentrated to carry on the offensive. However, around 11:00 the tank of Bossut, Trompe-la-Mort ("Dare-devil") leading the advance, carrying a tricolour <b>fanion</b> blessed in the Sacré-Cœur at Montmartre, received a direct heavy artillery hit, incinerating most of the crew and blowing Bossut himself from the rear entrance from which he had been directing the battle, killed by a shell splinter through the heart. Nevertheless, the Schneiders continued their progress, advancing several miles in a narrow penetration through a shallow valley towards the third German trench. The weakened infantry though, was unable to follow, forcing the tanks to wait for the arrival of reserve units. For several hours the tanks moved up and down the conquered terrain to avoid presenting static targets for the German artillery. Despite this many vehicles were hit, as they were in plain sight of German batteries on the surrounding hills. Flank assaults by Bavarian stormtroopers were repulsed. In the early evening, fresh infantry units together with the tanks conquered a sector of the third trench, marking the high tide of the French progress during the entire Second Battle of the Aisne. The Schneiders then withdrew, again suffering losses by artillery fire.|$|E

At Zero Hour, the 66th Division advanced behind a creeping bombardment, through German artillery and machine-gun counter-barrages, which caused many casualties, entered the German first position and fought hand-to-hand with the Prussian Guard. On the extreme right flank near La Royère Farm, the 67th Division made little headway but the 66th Division pushed on to the Panthéon, Orage and Bovettes quarries. By [...] the division had advanced between <b>Fanion</b> Trench, the east end of the German second position and Lützen Trench. Bois de Veau was entered but the division was not able to advance down the slopes to Pargny-Filain. The 67th Division had been repulsed from Tonnerre and other quarries and a further advance by the 66th Division was postponed until they were captured. During the night the division organised a defensive flank from Bois de Veau to Bovettes Quarry.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the right}} of the 38th Division, the 66th Division and the XXXIX Corps {{regiment}} of the 67th Division, extended the attack front east to the Chevrégny spur, to force 5th Guard Division out of the ruins of Panthéon Farm, [...] Panthéon Quarry and Orage Quarry. The objectives were the east end of the Malmaison plateau and two lines of trenches further back; <b>Fanion</b> Trench to the north, the east end of the German second position and Lützen Trench just below the crest towards Pargny-Filian. The Chasseurs Alpins and the 67th Division, were to attack part of the neck joining the Malmaison plateau to the Chevrégny Spur, reach the Les Bovettes water-tower and then work down the ravine {{on the east side of}} the north of the Malmaison plateau and down the Bovettes ravine to Pargny-Filain, to capture Lützen Trench, Pargny-Filain village and Bois de Veau, in the depression between Fort de la Malmaison and Pargny-Filain. During the advance, the French would have to pass the subterranean quarries near Les Bovettes, the Tonnerre Quarry and across the crest, where the French could be engaged by the German artillery on the Monampteuil Heights.|$|E

As a result, the single flag displays all the battle honours earned by every rifle battalion.|$|R
50|$|During {{the arrival}} of the {{regiment}} in camp Arue of December 9, 1963, the regiment conserved three battalions. Two battalions were assigned to works, they both merged in 1964, and one battalion was assigned to service. On April 30, 1964, for the celebration of Camerone, the 5e RMP received a new insign which reminded the original lieu of garrison, the belonging to the legion, to the Génie and the garrison in Polynesia.

50|$|Much {{attention}} {{had been}} given to ergonomics, Mourret's stated motive in having the tank designed by a shipyard. The vehicle was less cramped than earlier designs, the crew being able to more or less walk through the hull, with only a slight crouch. The mechanic could access the engine at both sides. The commander could communicate with the driver, the front machine-gunner and the mechanic via speaking tubes. External communications were the responsibility of the mechanic who could lift a little hatch just behind the turret to give signals by <b>fanions,</b> pyrotechnic devices or electrical lights. The tank could be entered through the cupola, but each member had oval or round escape hatches above and below him.|$|R

The {{remainder of the}} force were regrouped in a marching battalion BM 5, which the units of traditions kept the <b>fanions</b> of their battalion. In February 1946, the legionniares were authroized to cross the Tonkin frontier, to push the Viet Minh, their new adversary, approaching Son La. They were stopped by the accords of Hanoi. Linked to the exterior world only by radio and parachuting, they succeeded in June to reach the province of Sam Neua, which they protected against the pillards. On November 1, 1946, the BM 5 was dissolved. On December 12, 1946, the remainder embarked on the Sontay in direction to Algeria and the maison mère of Sidi bel-Abbès.|$|R

40|$|A B S T R A C T: A {{series of}} {{phlogopite}} and biotite samples were examined by wide-line NMR spectroscopy. Monitoring of the fluorine signal revealed the presence ofhomogeneous fl orine domains. The {{importance of these}} domains creased with increase in F and Fe contents. A model for the distribution <b>fanions</b> and cations in the octahedral sheet of micas is presented and discussed. The distribution of ions within a given mineral or between existing minerals has been, for many decades, the subject of numerous investigations (Goldschmidt, 1937). Most of the early information came from detailed chemical analysis of large collections of natural samples. Distribution coefficients of various elements have also been determined for synthetic materials (Munoz, 1974, 1977). The use of spectroscopic methods is now widespread: the ordering of Fe in lattice sites of silicate minerals may be determined by Mfssbauer spectroscopy (Goodman, 1980); different cationic associations surrounding the OH groups of amphiboles have also been detected successfully by IR (Strens, 1974). We have shown recently how information regarding the distribution of ions in the octahedral sheet of micas may be obtained by NMR (Sanz & Stone, 1977, 1979; Stone &...|$|R

5000|$|A <b>fanion</b> {{is a small}} flag used by the French military; the {{equivalent}} of an American guidon or British company colour. The name derives from the Italian word gonfanone, or gonfanon. They were often attached to a small staff which {{was placed in the}} muzzle of a rifle.|$|E

5000|$|During Piaf's {{tour of the}} stalags in Germany {{during the}} war, one of the famous Monnot-Asso songs, [...] "Le <b>fanion</b> de la Légion", was banned because it had created such {{patriotic}} fervor in Parisian audiences.

Asso's songs from this era were put to the music of Marguerite Monnot, who became the regular composer for la Môme. During this period, Asso also wrote songs for Marie Dubas including [...] "Le <b>Fanion</b> de la Légion" [...] ("The Legion's Flag") and [...] "Mon légionnaire" [...] ("My Legionnaire").|$|E
5000|$|The same year, Monnot met the lyricist Raymond Asso, {{with whom}} she was to {{collaborate}} for many years.

This song, together with another inspired by the same colonial theme, [...] "Le <b>fanion</b> de la Légion", written in 1938, established Monnot and Asso as a successful songwriting team. This was the era of such songs as [...] "Morocco coeurs brulées" [...] and the films of Jean Gabin featuring soldiers in North Africa.
