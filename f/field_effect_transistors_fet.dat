40|$|The {{building}} blocks of silicon-based microelectronics are <b>field</b> <b>effect</b> <b>transistors</b> (<b>FET)</b> whose basic function is to switch electrical current between two electrodes on and off with a third electrode (gate). Building a single molecule FET is naturally {{considered to be a}} critical step towards the ultimate goal of molecular electronics. FET-like behavior has been demonstrated in carbon nanotubes[1] and semiconductor nanowires,[2] and Coulomb blockade[3 - 6] and Kondo effects[4 - 5] have been recently observed in molecular systems using a back gate at low temperatures. Theoretical models have predicted that the conductance of a single molecule can be modulated with a gate electrode via resonant tunneling[7 - 8]. Experimental demonstration of this FET behavior in single molecules has, however, been a difficult challenge because it requires one to: 1) find a reliable method to wire a single molecule to the source and drain electrodes; and 2) place the gate electrode a few Å away from the molecule to achieve the required gate field.
