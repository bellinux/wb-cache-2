This document describes the representation of identity information in POLICY_DATA object for supporting policy based admission control in the Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP). The goal of identity representation is to allow a process on a system to securely identify the owner {{and the application of}} the communicating process (e. g., user id) and convey this information in RSVP messages (PATH or RESV) in a secure manner. We describe the encoding of identities as RSVP policy element. We describe the processing rules to generate identity policy elements for multicast merged flows.

In summary, we describe the use of this identity information in an operational setting.

40|$|Besides the {{ray tracing}} technique, the radiosity method is another major {{approach}} for global illumination modeling {{in the field}} of computer graphics. Since this method needs a huge amount of storage space (both memory and disk) and a long pre-computation cycle, it is not suitable to implement it on conventional workstations. Supercomputers seem to be necessary for such kind of graphics applications. However, some problems appear with the integration of supercomputers and workstations in a distributed computing environment, especially for graphics application. The major problems are: (i) unavailability of standard higher-level mechanisms for building distributed application; (ii) transparent access to supercomputers without remote login or file transfer sessions; (iii) computation balance to make the best use of the performance of supercomputers and workstations; (iv) data transfer/storage strategy between supercomputers and workstations; and (v) conflict between interaction and response time for graphics applications. In this paper we suggest solutions to the above mentioned problems based on the remote procedure call (RPC) and the client/server model, for the radiosity package implementation. After the introduction of the radiosity method, we concentrate on the integration between supercomputers and high-performance workstations. We also convey some general issues related to distributed computing and present the experience with our implementation, such as the application protocol <b>definition,</b> <b>error</b> recovery, code debugging etc. The radiosity package has been implemented at ZGDV in Darmstadt, F.

In case geometric data are extracted from IFC files, three types of geometrical errors are often encountered: clash errors where two building solids intersect, space <b>definition</b> <b>errors</b> where a building space volume is incorrectly defined leaving volume gaps between the space and neighboring building entities (walls, slabs, [...] .) and surface orientation errors, where the normal vector of some boundary surfaces of building solids points to the wrong direction, generating a misconception on which area is inside or outside the solid. These errors are introduced either in the design process or during export from the BIM authoring tool. In this paper, error detection and correction algorithms are introduced to address each individual error type. The algorithms are tested on the geometrical data of the IFC files of two office buildings, where errors of the types mentioned above were detected and automatically corrected...|$|R
