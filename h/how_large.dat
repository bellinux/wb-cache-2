Graves {{did not realize}} <b>how</b> <b>large</b> the French fleet was, and neither did Cornwallis.

5|$|In {{computer}} science, integer sorting is the algorithmic {{problem of}} sorting {{a collection of}} data values by numeric keys, {{each of which is}} an integer. Algorithms designed for integer sorting may also often be applied to sorting problems in which the keys are floating point numbers, rational numbers, or text strings. The ability to perform integer arithmetic on the keys allows integer sorting algorithms to be faster than comparison sorting algorithms in many cases, depending on the details of which operations are allowed in the model of computing and <b>how</b> <b>large</b> the integers to be sorted are.|$|E
5|$|Custer’s 7th Cavalry {{advance party}} {{attacked}} Cheyenne and Lakota tribes at their {{camp on the}} Little Big Horn River (known as the Greasy Grass River to the Lakota) on June 25, 1876. The U.S. Army did not realize <b>how</b> <b>large</b> the camp was. More than 2,000 Native American warriors had left their reservations to follow Sitting Bull. Inspired by a vision of Sitting Bull’s, in which he saw U.S. soldiers being killed {{as they entered the}} tribe’s camp, the Cheyenne and Lakota fought back. Custer's badly outnumbered troops lost ground quickly and were forced to retreat. The tribes led a counter-attack against the soldiers on a nearby ridge, ultimately annihilating them.|$|E

5|$|Since Carcharocles {{is derived}} from Otodus, and the two had teeth that bear a close {{similarity}} {{to those of the}} sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus), megalodon may have had a build more similar to the sand tiger shark than to other sharks. However, this is unlikely since sand tiger sharks are axial swimmers that flex their body for propulsion, meaning that they are adapted for acceleration rather than for maintaining high cruising speeds. A large sand tiger shark would require large fins to propel itself, however this in itself would create more drag and offset efficiency, so it is unlikely that they had similar body shapes given <b>how</b> <b>large</b> megalodon was.|$|E
5|$|The Regent of Madiun, Raden Rangga Prawirasentika, {{participated in}} funding the {{construction}} of Taman Sari. Prawirasentika also beseeched the Sultan to be relieved of Madiun's tax obligation. He offered other alternative ways of payment. The Sultan accepted his proposal. In 1758, the Sultan commanded the Regent to supervise the making of bricks and various complements, which {{would be used to}} build a beautiful garden. The sultan wanted a place where he could spend some time to relax after many years of wars that he had just experienced. Raden Tumenggung Mangundipura, under supervision of Raden Arya Natakusuma (who later became Sri Pakualam II), was responsible for the construction. The building was started in 1684 Javanese year (1758 AD). After finding out <b>how</b> <b>large</b> the complex was, Raden Rangga Prawirasentika realized that the cost would have been greater than the taxes. He resigned from the project and was replaced by Prince Natakusuma who continued the project to completion.|$|E
5|$|Shirts are {{normally}} {{made of a}} polyester mesh, which does not trap the sweat and body heat {{in the same way}} as a shirt made of a natural fibre. Most professional clubs have sponsors' logos on the front of their shirts, which can generate significant levels of income, and some also offer sponsors the chance to place their logos on the back of their shirts. Depending on local rules, there may be restrictions on <b>how</b> <b>large</b> these logos may be or on what logos may be displayed. Competitions such as the Premier League may also require players to wear patches on their sleeves depicting the logo of the competition. A player's number is usually printed on the back of the shirt, although international teams often also place numbers on the front, and professional teams generally print a player's surname above his number. The captain of each team is usually required to wear an elasticated armband around the left sleeve to identify him as the captain to the referee and supporters.|$|E

5|$|The dungeon has a fleshed-out ecology: certain {{creatures are}} natural enemies. For example, Flies and Spiders are often found {{at odds with}} one another. Common {{behaviours}} when a creature is angry include vandalising the dungeon and deserting the player. The creatures are varied in their statistics; some excel at certain tasks, and others refuse to perform certain tasks. Which creatures enter the dungeon depends on which rooms the player has and <b>how</b> <b>large</b> they are; most creatures have prerequisites for entering service. Creatures require paying regularly, and when 'Payday' comes, will head for the Treasure room to collect their wages. Other ways to obtain creatures include imprisoning and torturing them, 'scavenging' (persuaded to defect to the player) from enemy keepers, and performing certain sacrifices at the Temple. Creatures entering via the Portal are at the lowest experience level, and must gain experience, usually by training in the training room. Training creatures increases their attributes (such as hit points) and abilities (such as which spells they can cast). Such spells include lightning bolts, rebounding projectiles, and increasing armour. Creatures will frequently enter combat with heroes or creatures belonging to another keeper. Each creature has a star of the colour of the keeper it belongs to above it, displaying its experience level. The star is a health meter; as a creature takes damage, the spikes turn black. The player {{has the ability to}} possess a creature, seeing the dungeon from its first-person perspective and using its attacks and abilities. This is one of the spells; others include speeding creatures up, and healing them.|$|E
5|$|The {{siege of}} Bedford Castle {{required}} huge resources. Siege engines were brought from Lincoln, Northampton and Oxfordshire, while carpenters built others on site using timber from Northamptonshire; ropes from London, Cambridge and Southampton; hides from Northampton and tallow from London. Labourers from across Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire were {{gathered by the}} relevant sheriffs, and miners from Hereford and the Forest of Dean. Crossbow bolts were ordered from a depot at Corfe Castle and from the provinces; 43,300 crossbow bolts {{are known to have}} been ordered by the king. Local trees were cut down, and stone quarrying begun to provide ammunition for siege engines. Tents and pavilions for the King were sent from London along with supplies of luxury foods and wine, also for the King. In total, Henry's wage bill for the siege came to £1,311; it is uncertain exactly <b>how</b> <b>large</b> Henry's army was, but potentially there were between 1,600 and 2,700 men present at any one time. To support the siege, Langton instructed his bishops to mobilise one man from every 24 hectares (60 acres) of land they owned and levied a special tax on the churches' estates.|$|E
