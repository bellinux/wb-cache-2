50|$|In 1984, after President Mitterrand renounced the left's Common Programme and the <b>electoral</b> <b>sanction</b> in the European Parliament {{election}} (only 11% of votes) the PCF's ministers {{resigned from}} the cabinet. An electoral decline ensued and Marchais faced internal dissent from figures such as Pierre Juquin, Claude Poperen and former ministers as Charles Fiterman. Indeed, some party members, notably among the locally elected, accused him of leading a suicidal strategy. He accused them of plotting with Mitterrand in order to dissolve the PCF in Social Democracy. He let André Lajoinie, leader of the Communist group in the French National Assembly, represent the party in the 1988 presidential election. He was reserved about perestroika. Unlike the Italian Communists, he refused to {{change the name of}} the French party {{after the collapse of the}} Soviet bloc.|$|E
40|$|We {{now know}} {{a good deal}} about {{economic}} voting, but that knowledge comes mostly from research on high-income democracies, such as those in North America and Western Europe. Of course, there are serious relevant studies on low-income democracies, but they are largely of single-country design, frequently employing aggregate data. Multi-national, individual-level survey designs are all but non-existent. Here we examine a 13 - nation pool of current Latin American voting surveys. From estimation of a fully specified, and vigorously challenged, voting model, we conclude there are general, and rather strong, sociotropic retrospective economic voting effects. This finding is ofnormative, as well as scientific importance, indicating that governments in these low-income democracies cannot escape <b>electoral</b> <b>sanction</b> for the delivery of poor economic performance...|$|E
40|$|A basic {{theory of}} electoral {{accountability}} is widely accepted by academic opinion: voters cause politicians to gain or lose office through periodic elections, thereby influencing policy through {{the threat of}} <b>electoral</b> <b>sanction.</b> Empirical studies {{run the gamut from}} findings of strong support for this theory, to mixed or conditional support, to weak or negative results. When electoral processes are analyzed in terms of two distinct causal linkages within a three-part chain of accountability, however, positive findings are revealed as weaker than they appear while a compelling trend emerges toward findings ranging from conditional to negative in the last two decades. This trend is visible in three topical areas -economic voting, political corruption, and ideological congruence- and it holds for both presidential and parliamentary regimes as well as for a variety of electoral systems. The new electoral skepticism's unsettling results and insightful methods may help to improve future research and reform efforts alike...|$|E
25|$|The HAM, a quasi-governmental {{organization}} {{mandated by}} the transitional constitution, imposed sanctions on both privately owned and state-owned media during the year, particularly during the election campaign, for inciting ethnic hatred or violence and for violating media regulations intended to ensure balanced <b>electoral</b> reporting. The <b>sanctions</b> included broadcast suspensions of several days or weeks.|$|R
40|$|This thesis investigates electoral {{accountability}} for incumbent {{leaders and their}} parties in Latin America. It addresses two central questions. First, it seeks to explain sources of contextual and institutional variation in {{the degree to which}} voters punish and reward incumbents. Second, it asks how voters hold incumbents accountable for other areas of government control besides the macro-economy. The first paper develops a framework of executive accountability as dependent on {{the degree to which the}} presidential candidate of the incumbent party is identified with the performance of the outgoing president. It differentiates between presidents running for re-election, successors, and non-successors. Estimating random-intercept random-slopes models on an original dataset, it shows different levels of {{accountability for}} the three types of candidates. The second paper examines whether endorsements from incumbent politicians to co-partisans lead to more <b>electoral</b> <b>sanctioning.</b> It uses a randomised experiment embedded in a national survey conducted in the run-up to the 2012 Mexican general election to demonstrate that Senate candidates endorsed by the outgoing president are held more electorally accountable. Using a difference-in-difference design, the third paper finds causal evidence of tactical allocation of federal funds to municipalities governed by co-partisans of the president in the run-up to the 2006 Mexican presidential election. It shows that voters rewarded the party in the federal government for these additional transfers to their municipalities by voting for the ruling party. Taken together, the three papers have important theoretical implications for the study of electoral accountability, comparative electoral behaviour, and the quality of democracy in Latin America...|$|R
40|$|Paper 1 : “Can the Internet Promote Political Accountability? Evidence from a Laboratory Experiment” [...] - Abstract. We {{ask whether}} {{technical}} progress in information communication technology (ICT) can increase political accountability via a ‘Fire-Alarm Mechanism’: Despite ordinary citizens’ cognitive and motivational limitations to inform themselves about politics, ICT substantially increase the monitoring capability {{of those who}} act as watchdogs. Because of the resulting higher transparency, politicians anticipate that citizens at large might get more informed about their wrongdoings. To avoid <b>electoral</b> <b>sanctions,</b> they will act more representatively ex ante. Therefore, citizens {{do not need to}} be well-informed in actuality, it suffices that there is the potential to become well-informed through the watchdogs. We test this mechanism in a laboratory experiment that reflects the accountability relationship between a voter and a politician in information environments with increasing progress in ICT. In line with the predictions, subjects anticipate higher monitoring and justify their decision with the fear of being sanctioned more often. However, as an unexpected second effect, we find that they also justify their decision less frequently with fairness considerations. Overall, the two opposing effects do not lead to an increase in accountability. Our results imply that progress in ICT has the potential to increase accountability, but policy designers have to take negative side effects of higher control into consideration. [...] Paper 2 : “Why German Political Elites Support Governmental Transparency – Self-Interest, Anticipation of Voters’ Preferences or Socialization?” [...] - Abstract. We compare three analytically distinctive motivations that could explain transparency support among German political elites: (1) Principal-agent theory suggests that elites have no incentive to reduce their informational advantage over voters. (2) From an office-seeking perspective, it is beneficial to support popular issues such as transparency. (3) Democratic-elitism suggests a specific elite-socialisation leads to high support of civil liberties like transparency. Analysing survey data of candidates for the German Bundestag 2009, we find high variance among elites and complementary influence of the motivations. Membership in left-leaning parties has the strongest positive effect. We find anticipation effects among candidates that are highly dependent on voters’ support and whose voters are in favour of transparency at the same time. Further, transparency support is higher among young candidates. The findings imply that more transparency policies might be implemented in the future if public support for transparency increases and older candidate cohorts are replaced. [...] Paper 3 : “Online and Open-Minded. Cross-Country and Panel Analyses of the Impact of Internet Usage on Liberal Attitudes” [...] - Abstract. Does internet usage promote liberal attitudes? From our theoretical perspective, internet effects differ from those of traditional media: Via different technical mechanisms the internet changes who can broadcast and control information and it connects people with very different backgrounds. This leads to a more liberal agenda and an atmosphere of higher openness and tolerance. Our claim is tested with data from 57 countries of the World Values Survey. Multi-level analyses reveal that internet usage has a significant positive effect on liberal attitudes in many countries. The more liberal a country is, the stronger is the effect. In contrast, television viewing tends to have no effect in liberal countries and is even related with more conservative attitudes in conservative countries. Similar effects can be reproduced with fixed effects models and panel data from the Dutch LISS panel. Therefore, the effects are not caused by unobserved heterogeneity that would explain both internet usage and liberal attitudes. In conclusion, internet effects clearly differ from traditional media effects and the further diffusion of internet technology has the potential to increase open-mindedness...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} a {{political}} system {{to respond to the}} preferences of its citizens is central to democra-tic theory and practice; yet most empirical research on government responsiveness has concen-trated on the United States. As a result, we know very little about the nature of government policy responsiveness in Europe and we have a poor understanding of the conditions that affect cross-national variations. This comparative study examines the relationship between public opinion and policy preferences in the United Kingdom and Denmark during the past three decades. We address two key questions: First, are the government’s policy intentions driven by public opinion or vice versa? Second, do political institutions influence the level of government responsiveness? We suggest that public opinion tends to drive the government’s policy intentions due to the threat of <b>electoral</b> <b>sanction,</b> and that this is more pronounced in proportional systems than in majoritarian democracies. The relationship between mass public opinion and public policy {{is at the heart of}} normative democratic theory. Government responsiveness to mass preferences is fundamental to most conceptions of democracy (Lijphart, 1984; Dahl, 1967). Yet, in spite of the importance of this issue, most empirical research on th...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{strategic}} interaction between a firm, an extortionary mafia, and a potentially corrupt government. The model identifies several results. First, government spending is not monotonic in revenues. Second, although the firm wants {{the government to}} challenge the mafia (it uses the threat of electoral sanctions to induce {{the government to do}} so), in equilibrium, the firm does not directly appeal to the government for protection even though it is extorted. The more likely the government is to uncover mafia extortion independent of an appeal from the firm, the more effective the firm’s threat of <b>electoral</b> <b>sanction</b> is at motivating the government to invest in law enforcement. This is because the electoral threat to punish failure on the government’s part is only a compelling reason to invest in law enforcement when the government actually expects to confront the mafia. This same logic also implies that the relationship between mafia strength and government corruption is somewhat counterintuitive. When the mafia is strong in equilibrium (i. e. pervasive and extorting large fees), the government is not very corrupt. When the mafia is weak, the government is highly corrupt. Finally, an extension shows that if the mafia and government can collude, then the harsher the threatened sanctions against the mafia, the less likely the government is to challenge the mafia because the mafia is more willing to bribe the government. 1...|$|E
40|$|The 2016 U. S. presidential {{election}} {{can be described}} as nostalgic. On one hand, there was the fond remembrance of the Clinton administration characterized by a period of economic prosperity which overshadowed the more disastrous aftermath of various policies (the crime bill, the welfare reform, the Defense of Marriage Act, the repeal of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, etc.). On the other, the 2016 election brought to the surface a dormant longing for a privileged past rooted in open discrimination, inequality, segregation, and white supremacy, echoed by Donald Trump’s campaign. The Republican candidate had won the party’s nomination by openly and devoutly proselytizing against minority groups that allegedly threaten the fabric, integrity, and security of the United States. The more ethnic stereotypical caricatures and outright lies he employed in his speeches, the more successful his primary campaign was and the more he unnerved the Republican establishment, the general electorate, and the media. Yet Donald Trump’s campaign was not innovative by any means. Instead, as this study will argue, Trump’s electoral success during the primary elections can be in part attributed to the Republican Party’s decades-long history of strategic racism that has been instrumental in grooming the party’s base into Donald Trump’s supporters. In order to showcase that Trump’s ascendancy {{to the top of the}} Republican primary election was not a political accident, but a natural progression of decades-old officially <b>sanctioned</b> <b>electoral</b> policies, the study analyzes the origins behind the “dog whistle” practice, based on the model of strategic racism advanced by Ian Haney López. In conducting this research, I provide examples from U. S. public officials – past and present – and also highlight the role of the media in the propagation and cultivation of dog whistle politics...|$|R
