If there are gigs on the weekdays, she does the {{schoolwork}} as homework. She has mentioned in interviews that math, PE, and sewing are her favorite subjects in school. She regards her education as important, as it will allow her to do something else if the music doesn't work out or if she doesn't want to sing anymore; she has said that she wants to sing as long as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fun.</b> She has mentioned hairdressing as her future dream hobby. Despite her gigs, she has time to have holidays and she says the entertainment business hasn't been harsh on her. Her manager-father deals with the business side, and her parents support her in her career.|$|E
500|$|FLCL has {{received}} highly positive reviews from critics. Christopher McDonald of Anime News Network called it [...] "downright hilarious" [...] and [...] "visually superb" [...] with great music, citing the packaging of 2 episodes per DVD {{as the only}} weakness of Synch-Point's original release. Robert Nelson of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews gave the anime 4 out of 5 stars stating, [...] "FLCL {{may not have a}} straightforward or deep plot. It may not have complex characterizations. Hell, it may not have any meaning. But FLCL does succeed in its true objective. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>fun</b> to watch!" [...] Chris Beveridge of Mania gave it an A- stating, [...] "FLCL is something that allowed those involved to try a wide variety of styles and techniques and does come off as quite experimental. But nearly everything worked in their favor and you end up with three hours of nearly break neck speed action, comedy and commentary on modern life." [...] Brian Ruh praised the series stating, [...] "It was very frenetic and kept pushing the envelope on what was possible in Japanese animation." ...|$|E

500|$|Natasha's {{personality}} {{began to}} change and in October 2010, Novakovic said [...] "When she arrived she was full-on, {{and that was all}} a part of getting the attention she loves. It's all about knowing that she's liked. But she's more settled now". Novakovic also explained that it is [...] "quite challenging" [...] to play someone so different from herself, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fun.</b> She also hoped that she is not as irritating as Natasha in real life and added [...] "I'm not a manipulative teenage girl who's forever wanting everything her own way." [...] In March 2011, Novakovic revealed that she would like to see Natasha become a nicer person, grow up and turn over a new leaf. She said [...] "There are glimpses of the nice girl in Tash." [...] She later said that as she has played the villain for over a year, she would like to show Natasha's [...] "softer, funnier side." [...] Novakovic also hoped that her future storylines could see Natasha's background and her relationship with her mother explored and developed.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{opens with}} Leslie (Amy Poehler) and Tom (Aziz Ansari) {{responding}} to an incident at a park trail, where teenage boys {{are picking up}} plastic baggies of dog droppings and throwing them at each other. [...] Leslie tries to stop them but ends up playing along with the boys and admitting that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fun.</b> [...] Later, at the Pawnee town hall, a construction company has sent a gift basket with wine and cheese to the parks department, but Leslie locks it away {{because they are not}} allowed to accept gifts over $25. [...] Later, she and the others in the department look at a new social-networking site that April (Aubrey Plaza) has set up for the pit construction project. [...] The site already has seven friends, including city planner Mark (Paul Schneider), who Leslie is disappointed to see is friends with many scantily clad young women. [...] Leslie and Ann (Rashida Jones) see Mark and other city planners drinking beer in the town hall courtyard. [...] Leslie describes it as the exclusive [...] "boys' club" [...] and proposes that she and Ann crash it.|$|E
500|$|Pinto's {{first film}} of 2015 was Terrence Malick's Knight of Cups, an {{experimental}} film that featured an ensemble cast including Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Natalie Portman, and Antonio Banderas. She played Helen, a model with whom Bale embarks on a [...] "dalliance". She talked about acting without a script: [...] "It {{is definitely a}} bit nerve-racking {{on the first day}} because you don't know where you are going to go. But once you figure that out, then it doesn't really matter. It is actually very relaxing. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>fun</b> and liberating. It is an experience that I completely embrace". Premiering at the competition section of the 65th Berlin International Film Festival, the film received average to mixed reviews from critics. The film was released in the United States in March 2016. She was among the 100 narrators of Unity (2015), a documentary that explores the relationships between Earth's species. Her third release of that year was the Colombian action film Blunt Force Trauma, in which she starred opposite Ryan Kwanten and Mickey Rourke as a woman looking for her brother's murderer. John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter criticised the film, stating that it [...] "takes itself much more seriously than viewers will." [...] In 2015, Pinto worked on Andy Serkis' Jungle Book, a motion capture adventure fantasy film based on Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book. She will portray Mowgli's adoptive mother in the film.|$|E

2500|$|Writing for The New Indian Express, Pramod Thomas criticised the script, saying [...] "the {{sequences}} {{where the}} intelligence of the protagonist is shown as an election-winning tactic are difficult to chew...the screening of yesteryear scenes from the popular Mohanlal starrers seems to be okay in the beginning, but with weary repetition, even the hardcore fans will lose patience,". The critic from Sify called it [...] "average", and said: [...] "In all fairness, the initial moments of the film are pretty fine and more so, {{when compared to the}} rest of the film...Mohanlal's comic lines and sequences from his yesteryear hits are used in plenty especially in the first half, in an impressive way...at times <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fun</b> when logic if defied in films, but least of all it should be entertaining, right?", also criticised the script.|$|E

60|$|To any one {{who should}} come from a {{southern}} sanatorium to the Alps, the row of sun-burned faces round the table would present the first surprise. He would begin by looking for the invalids, and he would lose his pains, for not {{one out of five}} of even the bad cases bears the mark of sickness on his face. The plump sunshine from above and its strong reverberation from below colour the skin like an Indian climate; the treatment, which consists mainly of the open air, exposes even the sickliest to tan, and a tableful of invalids comes, in a month or two, to resemble a tableful of hunters. But although he may be thus surprised at the first glance, his astonishment will grow greater, as he experiences the effects of the climate on himself. In many ways it is a trying business to reside upon the Alps: the stomach is exercised, the appetite often languishes; the liver may at times rebel; and because you have come so far from metropolitan advantages, it does not follow that you shall recover. But one thing is undeniable--that in the rare air, clear, cold, and blinding light of Alpine winters, a man takes a certain troubled delight in his existence which can nowhere else be paralleled. He is perhaps no happier, but he is stingingly alive. It does not, perhaps, come out of him in work or exercise, yet he feels an enthusiasm of the blood unknown in more temperate climates. It may not be health, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fun.</b>|$|E
