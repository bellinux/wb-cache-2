500|$|Clarke {{arrived in}} Florida {{at the end}} of April. The short story, [...] "The Man Who Ploughed the Sea", {{included}} in the Tales from the White Hart (1957) collection, was influenced by his time in Florida. While in Key Largo in late May, Clarke met Marilyn Mayfield, and after a romance lasting less than three weeks, they travelled to Manhattan and married at New York City Hall. The couple spent their honeymoon in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, where Clarke proofread Childhood's End. In July, Clarke returned to England with Mayfield, but it quickly became clear that the marriage would not last as Clarke {{spent most of his time}} reading and writing, and talking about his work. Further, Clarke wanted to be a father, and Marilyn, who had a son from a previous marriage, informed Clarke after their marriage that she could no longer have children. When Childhood's End was published the following month, it appeared with a dedication: [...] "To Marilyn, <b>For</b> <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> read the proofs on our honeymoon." [...] The couple separated after a few months together, but remained married for the next decade.|$|E

In the booklet of The Open Door, she stated that her long-time friend and husband, Josh Hartzler, was the main {{inspiration}} for the song. In the booklet she wrote, [...] "Josh, you are my muse. Nothing inspires me the way you do. Thank you for all my missing pieces. Thank you for your strength and love. Thank you <b>for</b> <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> see myself through your eyes, because only then could I know that I am good enough for you." [...] One of the band's previous singles, [...] "Bring Me to Life", was also written about Josh Hartzler. In an interview with VH1, Lee further revealed the inspiration behind the song, saying [...] "I had gone through a lot of difficult things during the writing of the whole album, and by the end of it, I had stepped away from those bad situations. That's really hard. You have to be really brave and strong about it. After doing that, I felt so amazing. For the first time I felt like I could write a song based on how good I felt. I have never done that before ever. During another interview with The Washington Post she stated: ...|$|E

2500|$|As a rule, [...] "thanks" [...] is {{signaled}} {{to the vehicle}} behind by switching between the left- and right-turn signal several times, whereas turning on the hazard-warning lights (both turn signals) means [...] "Slow down; danger ahead". As cars would normally use the hazard-warning lights for [...] "thanks", in trucks distinction is necessary. The truck blocks the view of drivers behind it, hence a distinction must be made between [...] "Thanks <b>for</b> <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> pass" [...] and [...] "Danger in front, I may brake hard!" [...] Turning on the left-turn signal (in a right-hand traffic country) when a vehicle behind attempts to overtake means [...] "Back off; lane not clear", and turning on the right-turn signal means [...] "Go ahead; lane clear".|$|E

2500|$|Later, as {{it became}} clear that Peniston was leaping from the Overweight Pooch's album {{to the top of the}} charts, rumor had it the Pooch was stewing over Peniston's using Female Preacher as her springboard. Tonya Davis, {{pregnant}} at the time of recording her album, swore she harbored no jealousy towards Peniston. [...] "There's no jealousy, because she has a voice. I gave her the chance, but I didn't give her a voice," [...] the rapper insisted for Phoenix New Times in July 1992, and Peniston, interviewed by the same newspaper in the meantime, reacted by her own words. [...] "I feel like anything's possible and I know one thing. If I wasn't at this spot, I still would be achieving to get to this spot." [...] Ironically enough, Sallard eventually threw in a few back-up vocals for Peniston on a song with a significant title, [...] "You Win, I Win, We Lose", while Peniston, who in return played an agent to get a record deal also for Malaika (whose album Sugar Time scored in 1993 two Top 5 hits on the US Dance chart, including the No. 1 single [...] "Gotta Know (Your Name)") mentioned the Pooch's name on her own debut album in addition, leaving Davis a note saying [...] "thanks <b>for</b> <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> be a part of Female Preacher".|$|E
