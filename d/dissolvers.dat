40|$|A {{flow test}} was {{performed}} in Scrap Recovery of HB-Line to document the flow available for hydrogen dilution in the <b>dissolvers</b> when the charge chute covers are removed. Air flow through the dissolver charge chutes, with the covers off, was measured. A conservative estimate of experimental uncertainty was subtracted from the results. After subtraction, the test showed that there is 20 cubic feet per minute (cfm) air flow through the <b>dissolvers</b> during dissolution with a glovebox exhaust fan operating, even with the scrubber not operating. This test also showed there is 6. 6 cfm air flow through the <b>dissolvers,</b> after subtraction of experimental uncertainty if the scrubber and the glovebox exhaust fans are not operating. Three H-Canyon exhaust fans provide sufficient motive force to give this 6. 6 cfm flow. Material charged to the dissolver {{will be limited to}} chemical hydrogen generation rates that will be {{greater than or equal to}} 25 percent of the Lower Flammability Limit (LFL) during normal operations. The H-Canyon fans will maintain hydrogen below LFL if electrical power is lost. No modifications are needed in HB-Line Scrap Recovery to ensure hydrogen is maintained less that LFL if the scrubber and glovebox exhaust fans are not operating...|$|E

Materials were typically processed in nitric acid based (4 - 14 M) solutions containing fluoride concentrations less than 0. 2 M. The primary corrosion issue for the stainless steel <b>dissolvers</b> is the occurrence of localized corrosion near the tank bottom and the heat affected zones of the welds. Laboratory data for a range of operational conditions, including solution chemistry and temperature, was used {{to assess the impact of}} processing changes on the dissolver corrosion rate. Experimental and NDE-based general corrosion rates were found to be in reasonable agreement for standard dissolution chemistries consisting of nitric acid with fluorides and at temperatures less than 95 C.

40|$|During {{a camera}} {{inspection}} {{of a failed}} coil in the 6. 1 D <b>dissolver,</b> an orange discoloration was observed on {{a portion of the}} <b>dissolver</b> wall and coils. At the request of H-Canyon Engineering, the inspection video of the <b>dissolver</b> was reviewed by SRNL to assess if the observed condition (a non-uniform, orange-colored substance on internal surfaces) was a result of corrosion. Although the <b>dissolver</b> vessel and coil corrode during dissolution operations, the high acid conditions are not consistent with the formation of ferrous oxides (i. e., orange/rust-colored corrosion products). In a subsequent investigation, SRNL performed dissolution experiments to determine if residues from the nylon bags used for Pu containment could have generated the orange discoloration following dissolution. When small pieces of a nylon bag were placed in boiling 8 M nitric acid solutions containing other components representative of the H-Canyon process, complete dissolution occurred almost immediately. No residues were obtained even when a nylon mass to volume ratio greater than 100 times the 6. 1 D <b>dissolver</b> value was used.

40|$|An {{alternative}} to the FB-Line scrap recovery dissolver was desired for the dissolution of sand, slag, and crucible (SS{ampersand}C) residues from the plutonium reduction process due to the potential generation of hydrogen gas concentrations above the lower flammability limit. To address this concern, a flowsheet was developed for the F-Canyon <b>dissolvers.</b> The <b>dissolvers</b> are continually purged with nominally 33 SCFM of air; therefore the generation of flammable gas concentrations {{should not be a}} concern. Following removal of crucible fragments, small batches of the remaining sand fines or slag chunks containing less than approximately 350 grams of plutonium can be dissolved using the center insert {{in each of the four}} annular dissolver ports to address nuclear criticality safety concerns. Complete dissolution of the sand fines and slag chunks was achieved in laboratory experiments by heating between 75 and 85 degrees Celsius in a 9. 3 M nitric acid/ 0. 013 M (hydrogen) fluoride solution. Under these conditions, the sand and slag samples dissolved between 1 and 3 hours. Complete dissolution of plutonium and calcium fluorides in the slag required adjusting the dissolver solution to 7. 5 wt% aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (ANN). Once ANN was added to a dissolver solution, further dissolution of any plutonium oxide (PuO 2) in successive charges was not practical due to complexation of the fluoride by aluminum. During the laboratory experiments, well mixed solutions were necessary to achieve rapid dissolution rates. When agitation was not provided, sand fines dissolved very slowly. Measurement of the hydrogen gas generation rate during dissolution of slag samples was used to estimate the amount of metal in the chunks. Depending upon the yield of the reduction, the values ranged between approximately 1 (good yield) and 20 % (poor yield). Aging of the slag will reduce the potential for hydrogen generation as calcium metal oxidizes over time. The potential for excessive corrosion in the <b>dissolvers</b> was evaluated using experimental data reported in the literature. Corrosion data at the exact flowsheet conditions were not available; however, the corrosion rate for 304 L stainless steel (wrought material) corrosion coupons in 10 M nitric acid/ 0. 01 M hydrofluoric acid at 95 degrees Celsius was reported as 21 mils per year. If the fluoride in the dissolver is complexed with aluminum, the corrosion rate will decrease to approximately 5 mils per year...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{dissolution}} and characterization studies has been performed {{to determine if}} FB-Line residues stored in desicooler containers will dissolve using a modified H-Canyon processing flowsheet. Samples of desicooler materials were used to evaluate dissolving characteristics in the low-molar nitric acid solutions used in H-Canyon <b>dissolvers.</b> The selection for the H-Canyon dissolution of desicooler residues was based on their high-enriched uranium content and trace levels of plutonium. Test results showed {{that almost all of}} the enriched uranium will dissolve from the desicooler materials after extended boiling in one molar nitric acid solutions. The residue that contained uranium after completion of the extended boiling cycle consisted of brown solids that had agglomerated into large pieces and were floating on top of the dissolver solution. Addition of tenth molar fluoride to a three molar nitric acid solution containing boron did not dissolve remaining uranium from the brown solids. Only after boiling in an eight molar nitric acid-tenth molar fluoride solution without boron did remaining uranium and aluminum dissolve from the brown solids. The amount of uranium associated with brown solids would be approximately 1. 4 percent of the total uranium content of the desicooler materials. The brown solids that remain in the First Uranium Cycle feed will accumulate at the organic/aqueous interface during solvent extraction operations. Most of the undissolved white residue that remained after extended boiling was aluminum oxide containing additional trace quantities of impurities. However, the presence of mercury used in H-Canyon <b>dissolvers</b> should complete the dissolution of these aluminum compounds...|$|E
40|$|Uranium dioxide {{dissolution}} in {{nitric acid}} {{is a complex}} reaction. On the one hand, the dissolution produces nitrous oxides (NOX), {{which makes it a}} triphasic reaction. On the other hand, one of the products accelerates the kinetic rate; the reaction is hence called autocatalytic. The kinetics for these kinds of reactions need to be formalized in order to optimize and design innovative dissolution reactors. In this work, the kinetics rates have been measured by optical microscopy using a single particle approach. The advantages of this analytical technique are an easier management of species transport in solution and a precise following of the dissolution rate. The global rate is well described by a mechanism considering two steps: a non-catalyzed reaction, where the catalyst concentration has no influence on the dissolution rate, and a catalyzed reaction. The mass transfer rate of the catalyst was quantified in order to discriminate when the reaction was influenced by catalyst accumulated in the boundary layer or uncatalyzed. This first approximation described well the sigmoid dissolution curve profile. Moreover, experiments showed that solutions filled with catalyst proved to lose reactivity over time. Results pointed out that the higher the liquid-gas exchanges, the faster the kinetic rate decreases with time. Thus, it was demonstrated, for the first time, that there is a link between catalyst and nitrous oxides. The outcome of this study leads to new ways for improving the design of <b>dissolvers.</b> Gas-liquid exchanges are indeed a lever to impact dissolution rates. Temperature and catalyst concentration can be optimized to reduce residence times in <b>dissolvers...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{solutions}} {{from the}} dissolution of sand, slag, and crucible (SS&C) material are sufficiently different from previous solutions processed via the F-Canyon Purex process that the effectiveness of individual process steps needed to be ascertained. In this study, the effectiveness of gelatin strike was tested {{under a variety of}} conditions. Specifically, several concentrations of silica, fluoride, nitric acid (HNO{sub 3 }), boric acid (H{sub 3 }BO{sub 3 }), and aluminium nitrate nonahydrate (ANN) were studied. The disengagement times of surrogate and plant SS&C <b>dissolver</b> solutions from plant solvent also were measured. The results of the tests indicate that gelatin strike does not coagulate the silica at the low concentration of silica ({tilde 30 } ppm) expected in the SS&C <b>dissolver</b> solutions because the silicon is complexed with fluoride ions (e. g., SiF{sub 6 }{sup - 2 }). The silicon fluoride complex is expected to remain with the aqueous phase during solvent extraction. The disengagement times of the <b>dissolver</b> solutions from the plant solvent were not affected by the presence of low concentrations of silica and no third phase formation was observed in the disengagement phase with the low silica concentrations. Tests of surrogate SS&C <b>dissolver</b> solutions with higher concentration of silica (less than 150 ppm) did show that gelatin strike followed by centrifugation resulted in good phase disengagement of the surrogate SS{ampersand}C <b>dissolver</b> solution from the plant <b>dissolver</b> solution. At the higher silica concentrations, there is not sufficient fluoride to complex with the silica, and the silica must be entrained by the gelatin and removed from the <b>dissolver</b> solution prior to solvent extraction...|$|R
40|$|The {{first step}} in {{processing}} low-enriched uranium (LEU) targets for production of {sup 99 }Mo is to dissolve the neutron-irradiated uranium foil coming from the reactor.

On the basis of these dissolution rates, the process chemistry, and a model that integrates dissolution rates as a function of temperature and composition, a closed stainless-steel <b>dissolver</b> was designed, built, and tested for dissolving up to 18 g of uranium foil. The results were quite successful, with the uranium foil being dissolved within one hour as desired.

40|$|In {{support of}} the HB-Line Engineering {{agitator}} mixing project, flow pattern calculations have been made for a 90 {sup o} apart and helical pitch agitator submerged in a flat tank containing <b>dissolver</b> baskets. The work is intended to determine maximum agitator speed to keep the <b>dissolver</b> baskets from contacting the agitator for the nominal tank liquid level. The analysis model was based on one <b>dissolver</b> basket located on the bottom surface of the flat tank for a conservative estimate. The modeling results will help determine acceptable agitator speeds and tank liquid levels {{to ensure that the}} <b>dissolver</b> basket is kept from contacting the agitator blade during HB-Line <b>dissolver</b> tank operations. The numerical modeling and calculations have been performed using a computational fluid dynamics approach. Three-dimensional steady-state momentum and continuity equations were used as the basic equations to estimate fluid motion driven by an agitator with four 90 {sup o} pitched blades or three flat blades. Hydraulic conditions were fully turbulent (Reynolds number about 1 x 10 {sup 5 }). A standard two-equation turbulence model ({kappa},{var_epsilon}), was used to capture turbulent eddy motion. The commercial finite volume code, Fluent [5], was used to create a prototypic geometry file with a non-orthogonal mesh. Hybrid meshing was used to fill the computational region between the round-edged tank bottom and agitator regions. The nominal calculations and a series of sensitivity runs were made to investigate the impact of flow patterns on the lifting behavior of the <b>dissolver</b> basket. At high rotational speeds and low tank levels, local turbulent flow reaches the critical condition for the <b>dissolver</b> basket to be picked up from the tank floor and to touch the agitator blades during the tank mixing operations. This is not desirable in terms of mixing performance. The modeling results demonstrate that the flow patterns driven by the agitators considered here are not strong enough to lift up the <b>dissolver</b> basket for the agitator speeds up to 2500 rpm. The results also show that local velocity magnitudes for the three-blade flat plate agitator are at maximum three times smaller than the helical fourblade one.

40|$|The {{dissolution}} of composite materials containing plutonium (Pu) and tantalum (Ta) metals is currently performed in Phase I of the HB-Line facility. The {{conditions for the}} present flowsheet are the {{dissolution of}} 500 g of Pu metal in the 15 L dissolver using a 4 M nitric acid (HNO{sub 3 }) solution containing 0. 2 M potassium fluoride (KF) at 95 C for 4 - 6 h. [1] The Ta metal, which is essentially insoluble in HNO{sub 3 }/fluoride solutions, is rinsed with process water to remove residual acid, and then burned to destroy classified information. During the initial dissolution campaign, the total mass of Pu and Ta in the dissolver charge was limited to nominally 300 g. The reduced amount of Pu in the dissolver charge coupled with significant evaporation of solution during processing of several dissolver charges resulted in the precipitation of a fluoride salt contain Pu. Dissolution of the salt required the addition of aluminum nitrate (Al(NO{sub 3 }) {sub 3 }) and a subsequent undesired 4 h heating cycle. As {{a result of this}} issue, HB-Line Engineering requested the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) to optimize the dissolution flowsheet to reduce the cycle time, reduce the risk of precipitating solids, and obtain hydrogen (H{sub 2 }) generation data at lower fluoride concentrations. [2] Using samples of the Pu/Ta composite material, we performed three experiments to demonstrate the dissolution of the Pu metal using HNO{sub 3 } solutions containing 0. 15 and 0. 175 M KF. When 0. 15 M KF was used in the dissolving solution, 95. 5 % of the Pu in the sample dissolved in approximately 6 h. The undissolved material included a small amount of Pu metal and plutonium oxide (PuO{sub 2 }) solids. Complete dissolution of the metal would have likely occurred if the dissolution time had been extended. This assumption is based on the steady increase in the Pu concentration observed during the last several hours of the experiment. We attribute the formation of PuO{sub 2 } to the complexation of fluoride by the Pu. The fluoride became unavailable to catalyze the dissolution of PuO{sub 2 } as it formed {{on the surface of the}} metal. The mass of Pu dissolved is equivalent to the dissolution of 343 g of Pu in the HB-Line <b>dissolvers.</b> In the initial experiment with 0. 175 M KF in the solution, we achieved complete dissolution of the Pu in 6 h. The mass of Pu dissolved scales to the dissolution of 358 g of Pu in the HB-Line <b>dissolvers.</b> The second experiment using 0. 175 M KF was terminated after approximately 6 h following the dissolution of 92. 7 % of the Pu in the sample; however, dissolution of additional Pu was severely limited due to the slow dissolution rate observed beyond approximately 4 h. A small amount of PuO{sub 2 } was also produced in the solution. The slow rate of dissolution was attributed to the diminishing surface area of the Pu and a reduction in the fluoride activity due to complexation with Pu. Given time (> 4 h), the Pu metal may have dissolved using the original solution or a significant portion may have oxidized to PuO{sub 2 }. If the metal oxidized to PuO{sub 2 }, we expect little of the material would have dissolved due to the fluoride complexation and the low HNO{sub 3 } concentration. The mass of Pu dissolved in the second experiment scales to the dissolution of 309 g of Pu in the HB-Line <b>dissolvers.</b> Based on the data from the Pu/Ta dissolution experiments we recommend the use of 4 M HNO{sub 3 } containing 0. 175 M KF for the dissolution of 300 g of Pu metal in the 15 L HB-Line dissolver. A dissolution temperature of nominally 95 C should allow for essentially complete dissolution of the metal in 6 h. Although the H{sub 2 } concentration in the offgas from the experiments was at or below the detection limit of the gas chromatograph (GC) used in these experiments, small concentrations (< 3 vol %) of H{sub 2 } are typically produced in the offgas during Pu metal dissolutions. Therefore, appropriate controls must be established to address the small H{sub 3 } generation rates in accordance with this work and the earlier flowsheet demonstrated for Pu metal. [3...|$|E

For corrosion control, {{it may be necessary to}} initiate reaction at a decreased HNO{sub 3 } concentration and to increase it after a sufficient concentration of aluminum nitrate has accrued. The process may be adapted to batch processing, as well. Again, acid concentrations may be initially relatively small and, then, gradually increased as reaction proceeds until the desired excess of HNO{sub 3 } above stoichiometric quantity has been added. Other objects, advantages, and capabilities of the present invention will become more apparent as the description proceeds...|$|R
40|$|The unsteady-state {{continuous}} rotary <b>dissolver</b> {{material balance}} code (USSCRD) {{is a useful}} tool with which to study {{the performance of the}} rotary <b>dissolver</b> under a wide variety of operating conditions. The code does stepwise continuous material balance calculations around each <b>dissolver</b> stage and the digester tanks. Output from the code consists of plots and tabular information on the stagewise concentration profiles of UO{sub 2 }, PuO{sub 2 }, fission products, Pu(NO{sub 3 }) {sub 4 }, UO{sub 2 }(NO{sub 3 }) {sub 2 }, fission product nitrates, HNO{sub 3 }, H{sub 2 }O, stainless steel, total particulate, and total fuel in pins. Other information about material transfers, stagewise liquid volume, material inventory, and dissolution performance is also provided. This report describes the development of the code, its limitations, key operating parameters, usage procedures, and the results of the analysis of several sets of operating conditions. Of primary importance in this work was the estimation of the steady-state heavy metal inventory in a 0. 5 -t/d <b>dissolver</b> drum. Values ranging from {similar_to} 12 to > 150 kg of U + Pu were obtained for a variety of operating conditions. Realistically, inventories are expected to be near the lower end of this range. Study of the variation of operating parameters showed significant effects on <b>dissolver</b> product composition from intermittent solids feed. Other observations indicated that the cycle times for the digesters and shear feed should be closely coupled in order to avoid potential problems with off-specification product. 19 references, 14 tables...|$|R

40|$|The {{revolution}} in modes {{of design and}} production anticipate a liberalization of material/fabrication that can potentially allow the masses {{to take control of}} the design of the urban space. Historically with each technical invention, writing, printing press, and video-cameras, came not only the possibility for new creative practices but also the formation of the socio-political structures to allow such new praxis to mobilize and become effective. For example, with the advent of printing press, publishing houses organized the literary world, selecting culture for mass consumption, or film and television industry grew to broadcast programs and movies. During the ' 90 's, theories of virtuality and the commercialization and privatization of public spaces, were seen as potential <b>dissolvers</b> of physical public places. Today we should acknowledge the power of networked media and digital fabrication for their potential to physically build public good. This thesis explores and proposes a method to create urban places by designing three prototypes of urban objects that can be customized by the public and easily fabricated with a CNC router which will allow a digitally networked audience to participate in the physical making of space in their cities. by Michela Barone Lumaga.

40|$|The Analytical Development Section (ADS) of SRNL was {{requested}} {{to perform a}} waste disposal assay of two heater boxes which {{had been used in}} the HB Line <b>dissolvers.</b> They had been sent to SRNL for study to make recommendations on how to prevent future failure of the units when they were replaced. The study having been completed, the units needed to be characterized prior to sending to Solid Waste for disposal. An assay station consisting of a turntable, HPGe detector, CANBERRA Inspector, transmission source and a portable computer was set up to do the required assays. The assays indicate the presence of U- 235, Pu- 239 and Cs- 137. No measurable amounts of U- 235 or Pu- 239 were found. Therefore the Minimum Detectable Activities for U- 235 and Pu- 239 were calculated. For Heater Box 1, 0. 23 grams of U- 235 and 0. 24 grams of Pu- 239. For Heater Box 2, the results were 0. 21 grams of U- 235 and 0. 21 grams of Pu- 239. This paper describes and documents the assays employed to determine the amount of U, Pu and Cs contents of the heater boxes. The paper provides results of SNM assays using traditional calibration of the system and on one based on modeling. It also provides the scientific community with data that will assist the user in determining the method of choice for assaying items with irregular geometries...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{dissolution}} {{studies of}} aluminum clad {{mixed oxide fuel}} rods have been conducted using two different F-Canyon decladding and dissolving flowsheets. During {{the first phase of}} the experimental program, materials from three different color coded fuel rods were dissolved in caustic and nitric acid solutions. The final phase of the laboratory program involved the dissolution and characterization of materials from three cracked pellet fuel rods using a selected caustic/ nitric acid flowsheet. Laboratory results obtained from the initial dissolution studies identified several inconsistencies and potential problem issues with the behavior of materials from the color coded fuel rods. Based on these findings and influenced by the difficulties introduced by using the RCRA listed mercury during processing, the flowsheet selected for dissolving these aluminum clad fuel rods in F-Canyon <b>dissolvers</b> was the two- step caustic decladding/ nitric acid dissolution flowsheet. The final phase of the experimental program involved testing materials from three cracked pellet fuel rods using the selected flowsheet. Again all aluminum fuel rod components dissolved during the decladding step. However, some uranium and plutonium bearing solids remained with the caustic decladding solution which could be sent to waste. The quantities of uranium and plutonium expected to remain with the caustic solutions are small. Fluoride ions will need to be present in the nitric acid dissolver solution to dissolve all solids. At 0. 05 molar fluoride concentration, no plutonium bearing solids remained in the product solutions...|$|E

40|$|Unirradiated Mark 42 fuel {{tubes are}} to be {{dissolved}} in an upcoming campaign in F-canyon. Savannah River Technology Center (SRTC) /Chemical & Hydrogen Technology Section (CHTS) identified a flow sheet for the dissolution of these Mark 42 fuel tubes which required a more aggressive <b>dissolver</b> solution than previously required for irradiated Mark 42 fuel tubes. Subsequently, SRTC/MTS was requested to develop and perform a corrosion testing program {{to assess the impact}} of new flow sheets on corrosion of the <b>dissolver</b> wall. The two primary variables evaluated were the fluoride and aluminum concentrations of the <b>dissolver</b> solution. Fluoride was added as Calcium Fluoride (CaF{sub 2 }) while the aluminum was added either as metallic aluminum, which was subsequently dissolved, or as the chemical aluminum nitrate (Al(NO{sub 3 }) {sub 3 }). The dissolved aluminum metal was used to simulate the dissolution of the aluminum from the Mark 42 cladding and fuel matrix. Solution composition for the corrosion tests bracketed the flow sheet for the Mark 42. Corrosion rates of AISI Type 304 stainless steel coupons, both welded and non-welded coupons, were calculated from measured weight losses and post-test concentrations of soluble Fe, Cr and Ni. The corrosion rates, which ranged between 2. 7 and 32. 5 mpy, were calculated from both the one day and the one week weight losses. These corrosion rates indicated a relatively mild corrosion on the <b>dissolver</b> vessel. The welded coupons consistently had a higher corrosion rate than the non-welded coupons. The difference between the two decreased as the solution aggressiveness decreased. In these test solutions, aggressiveness corresponded with the fluoride concentration. Based on the results of this study, any corrosion occurring during the Mark 42 Campaign is not expected to have a deleterious effect on the <b>dissolver</b> vessel...|$|R
40|$|Short time {{corrosion}} testing of perforated sheets and wire meshes fabricated from Type 304 L stainless steel, Alloy 600 and C 276 showed that 304 L stainless steel perforated sheet should perform {{well as the}} material of construction for <b>dissolver</b> baskets. The baskets will be exposed to hot nitric acid solutions and are limited life components. The corrosion rates of the other alloys and of wire meshes were too high for useful extended service. Test results also indicated that corrosion of the <b>dissolver</b> should drop quickly during the dissolutions due to the inhibiting effects of the corrosion products produced by the dissolution processes...|$|R
