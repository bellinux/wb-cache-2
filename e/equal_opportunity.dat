Data from the British Workplace Employee Relations Survey of 1998 provide {{strong evidence that}} <b>equal</b> <b>opportunities</b> practices improve productivity overall, and increasingly so as the share of female and ethnic minority employees increases. However, short-term effects may be negative in segregated workplaces. Non-financial participation schemes are negatively associated with productivity, {{but in most cases}} the joint presence of these participatory schemes and <b>equal</b> <b>opportunities</b> practices significantly increases productivity. Interactions between participatory and <b>equal</b> <b>opportunities</b> schemes are also affected by work-force composition and by the level of <b>equal</b> <b>opportunities</b> policies implemented.

5|$|Biographer Andrew Morton {{noted that}} most of Madonna's admirers were females, who were born-and-brought-up with an image of old-fashioned {{stereotypes}} of women as virginal brides, or as whores, or with feminist values that rejected {{the use of a}} woman's looks for her self-advancement. Author William McKeen of Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology commented that with the song, Madonna became the last word in attitude and fashion for young girls of that time. He compared that image of Madonna with that of Barbie. McKeen explained that Madonna intermixed middle-class ideas of femininity with examples of what femininity meant to her, which was having <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity.</b> She offered an aggressive sexuality that implied it was acceptable for women not only to initiate relationships, but also enjoy them.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Analyse the {{existence}} of <b>equal</b> <b>opportunities</b> in rules and standards related to business management and typify the "Corporate Equality" distinction as a new <b>equal</b> <b>opportunities</b> certification. Design/methodology: The existing <b>equal</b> <b>opportunities</b> principles established in different standards and rules have been studied and the "Corporate Equality" distinction has been typified according to different criteria. Findings: Having analysed the existing <b>equal</b> <b>opportunities</b> principles established in different rules and standards concerning business management, {{it is obvious that}} these principles are not put into practice. Therefore, the distinction of “Corporate Equality" would indeed stand for a new certification that specifically controls how <b>equal</b> <b>opportunities</b> principles within the company are implemented. However, the lack of information about what these companies have actually achieved up to now limits the knowledge, awareness and appreciation of the different interest groups which deal with aforesaid firms on such matter. Originality/value: The article makes a theoretical contribution to typify the "Corporate Equality" distinction as a new <b>equal</b> <b>opportunities</b> certification. </p...|$|R
5|$|Legislation {{requires}} that all presidential and parliamentary election candidates (or slates) are guaranteed <b>equal</b> <b>opportunity</b> to present and discuss their platforms {{in the media}} (in addition to paid advertising). In 2007 the parliamentary election campaign was covered by all media, including nationwide television broadcasters. During this period the broadcasters, which included Croatian Radiotelevision (HTV), RTL Televizija (RTL) and Nova TV, aired 27.8hours of news on 22 different programs with 1,196 news reports. This total included 171 reports dealing directly with the elections. Analysis of news coverage indicated evenly-matched coverage of the combined ruling party (HDZ) and official government statements on one side, and the main opposition party (SDP) on the other; each received an average of a 37.5-percent share of coverage and a 33-percent share of interviews aired. HTV and Nova TV gave a slight advantage to the HDZ and the government, while RTL gave more coverage to the SDP. However, the differences were small and resulted in matching ratios. Other political parties received considerably less coverage. HNS received an average of approximately 11 percent of the coverage, HSS received six percent and all other parties received less than five-percent coverage. The national television broadcasters air programs where all slates and candidates may talk about their platforms and organise debates.|$|E

40|$|Theme of this diploma {{work are}} {{problems}} of <b>equal</b> <b>opportunities</b> at the labour market. The first part concentrates on unequality {{between men and}} women, causes of different social statuses, basic terms and legislative framework of <b>equal</b> <b>opportunities</b> {{of men and women}} in the European Union and the Czech Republic. Overview of present social status of women at the labour market is given by the analysis of basic statistic indicators differentiated by gender. Apart from the European Union, which set up <b>equal</b> <b>opportunities</b> as one of its fundamental goals, important initiators of gender precautions are individual companies. Therefore following parts of my work concentrate on companies' attitude to <b>equal</b> <b>opportunities</b> and first of all on main reasons for implementation of individual precautions and concrete steps, which should support the improvement of present situation. The last chapter deals with costs and benefits consequent upon implementation of <b>equal</b> <b>opportunities</b> and shows those precautions that certify in practice...|$|R

40|$|The basic {{assumption}} {{of the idea of}} <b>equal</b> <b>opportunities</b> is based on the assertion that all individuals competing for an advantaged social position should have <b>equal</b> <b>opportunities,</b> i. e., that {{each and every one of}} them should have fair opportunities to achieve a particular goal. Despite the fact that <b>equal</b> <b>opportunities</b> is one of the basic mechanisms for a just distribution of advantageous social positions, the idea of fair equality of opportunity remains divided between different competing political projects, e. g., egalitarian liberalism, libertarian political theory, multiculturalism, etc. This paper examines two basic dimensions of <b>equal</b> <b>opportunities</b> to which existing conceptions fail to offer a unanimous answer, i. e., a) the issue of fairness and b) the issue of the currency of fairness. The concluding part of this paper presents two basic paradoxes that determine both the direction of the discussion as well as the possible solutions to the achievement of fair <b>equal</b> <b>opportunities</b> as part of any process for competing for advantageous social positions...|$|R

40|$|Ensuring <b>equal</b> <b>opportunities</b> is a {{priority}} for CEO-s and decision makers, however, it is often not put into practice. Changes in recent years along with the priorities of the EU and the efforts made to banish discrimination becoming more prominent brought with themselves a pressure on firms to provide <b>equal</b> <b>opportunities</b> for the different under-privileged social groups. In Hungary the Act CXXV of 2003 on discrimination and <b>equal</b> <b>opportunities</b> lists the groups in need of protection. The law requires employers with more than fifty employees to have an <b>equal</b> <b>opportunities</b> program. In spite of this, these programs are often general and do not implement the changes and goals identified after the assessment. Still, strategies and plans are only worth how much of them are realized. Our article is about the conscious principles of the Hungarian business sector about equality and whether there are regional differences. We compare answers given by both employers and employees {{on the subject of}} the extent to which the above mentioned principles are realized by the management and whether the employees experience these changes. Our theory is that the prioritisation of <b>equal</b> <b>opportunities</b> in firms is more the result of access to project funds than that of inner initiative from the firm's management. We analyse our research questions using a quantitative method on a regionally representative national sample. We examined 992 firms with special attention on those and their employees who had some sort of written guidelines on <b>equal</b> <b>opportunities</b> and plans on implementing these. In our paper we give a short review on the importance of <b>equal</b> <b>opportunities,</b> it's manifestation in HR management and it's written declaration, the so called <b>Equal</b> <b>Opportunities</b> Plan (EOP). The efforts of the EU and access to financial resources for the EU projects as a condition our hypotheses are that (1) at least 30 % of the firms studied have written guidelines or declaration on <b>equal</b> <b>opportunities,</b> (2) the majority of these firms have a higher rate of disadvantaged employees and operate in economically undeveloped areas...|$|R
