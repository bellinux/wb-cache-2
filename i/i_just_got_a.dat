500|$|Andrew Garfield {{was given}} the role of Tommy, a well-meaning, rather dim young person who struggles {{to find a place}} in an {{environment}} which values imagination and creativity above all. He said of his character, [...] "There's a sense of anxiety that runs through these kids, especially Tommy, because he's so sensory and feeling and animalistic, that's my perspective of him." [...] Garfield was attracted to the film based on the existential questions the story expresses. He called the experience of being a part of Never Let Me Go a [...] "dream to come true". Garfield enjoys an opportunity to let loose with his roles. He said the scenes in which his character—unable to contain his frustration—erupts with a wail, was [...] "intense" [...] for him. [...] "I think those screams are inside all of us, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> chance to let mine out". Before shooting the film, he had read the screenplay and the book. In March 2009 Daily Variety reported that Knightley was signed to the project. Knightley admitted that she only agreed to appear in Never Let Me Go because co-star and friend Mulligan had asked her to. She portrays Ruth, a zealous, ambitious character who behaves manipulatively out of inner insecurity. When asked what she did and did not have in common with her character, Knightley said she was unable to relate to Ruth's situation of being involved in a love triangle.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Garfield co-starred {{opposite}} Carey Mulligan and Keira Knightley in Mark Romanek's dystopian {{science fiction}} drama Never Let Me Go, {{an adaptation of}} Kazuo Ishiguro's 2005 novel of the same name. He said of his character, Tommy D., [...] "There's a sense of anxiety that runs through these kids, especially Tommy, because he's so sensory and feeling and animalistic, that's my perspective of him." [...] Garfield was attracted to the film based on the existential questions the story expresses. He said {{the experience of being}} a part of Never Let Me Go was [...] "just a dream to come true".

[...] "I think those screams are inside all of us, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> chance to let mine out". For his portrayal of a well-meaning, but dim young man caught in a love triangle, he won the 2010 Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor. Cleveland Magazine Clint O'Connor lauded his performance, commenting that Garfield delivered [...] "a terrifically anguished performance" [...] in the film. Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman praised the performances of the lead cast, reflecting that [...] "these three all act with a spooky, haunted innocence that gets under your skin." [...] Tom Preston, a critic from The Guardian, further described Garfield's acting as solid and [...] "at times deeply moving". In comparison to Mulligan and Knightley, Scott Bowles, writing for USA Today, deemed Garfield [...] "the real find" [...] of Never Let Me Go.|$|E
2500|$|According to Stephen Shore's [...] "Factory: Andy Warhol," [...] "Andy and I {{were hanging}} around together. I had an {{apartment}} on the Lower East Side, where I had haircutting salons. Hundreds of people would come, and I’d be cutting someone's hair. Andy came. When he first started making films, he made films about what a person was famous for," [...] Billy, whose real name was William Linich Jr., and {{was the son of}} a barber, recalled. [...] "I was famous for giving haircuts, so he said, [...] "Would you let me do a film of you doing haircuts?" [...] I had covered my entire apartment in silver foil and painted everything silver. Andy said, [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> new loft would you do to it what you’ve done to your apartment?" [...] I said, [...] "Oh, sure, let's do it." [...] So, I started doing it. I was a technician— I’d been a light designer for [...] the Judson Church. I also worked for some off-Broadway theater and avant-garde dance companies. I installed all the lighting at the Factory, all the sound systems." [...] In return for making over his loft, Warhol gave Name a new role within the Factory. [...] "I was into light and sound before, but not photography," [...] Name said. [...] "Andy had a still camera, but he had gotten the Bolex. He was going to start to do films, and he gave me the Pentax and said, [...] "Here, Billy, you do the still photography; I’m going to start making films." [...] I became the in-house photographer and was sort of like the foreman. Eventually I moved in." [...] Name and Warhol eventually became lovers, but the romantic aspect of their relationship slowly dissolved into mutual loyalty and admiration.|$|E

I went in once to see whether Adrian was up to mischief there, and the Mother Butterfly {{looked at me as}} if I had seven heads; but <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> glimpse of the girl, and, as my uncle says, she would make an ideal Mona, or Miranda." ...|$|E

The best plan, I find, is to treat it as a game and take a hand in it. Last week {{he wanted to be a}} lion. I could see that was going to be awkward, he roaring for raw meat and thinking to prowl about the house at night. Well, I didn't nag him--that's no good. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> gun and shot him. He's a duck now, and I'm trying to keep him one: sits for an hour beside his bath on three china eggs I've bought him. Wish some of the sane ones were as little trouble." ...|$|E

He stated, [...] "People didn't think about the sound of things, people put on guitars and then clanged out stuff. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> tired of <b>a</b> guitar sound that wasn't thought about.

2500|$|In 1996, at the Ichthus music festival, Mullins cited {{personal}} {{reasons for his}} move. He {{was asked if he}} made the move because God had called him to proselytize and convert the Native Americans. To this Mullins responded, [...] "No. <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> tired of <b>a</b> White, Evangelical, middle class perspective on God, and I thought I would have more luck finding Christ among the Pagan Navajos. I'm teaching music." ...|$|R
5000|$|Hough {{described}} {{the process of}} writing the song in a behind the scenes video of making her second album.

In 1986 she said, [...] "People {{have to realize that}} <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> out of <b>a</b> very difficult marriage. I'm not the type of woman who needs to jump back into another. I liked my freedom when I got out of that one. I've had a few love affairs, but nothing important." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jamie McMurray, who {{threaded}} {{the needle}} between Busch and Johnson exiting Turn 2 {{on the final}} lap to claim a runner-up finish, said [...] "it’s really circumstantial {{as to what the}} guys do {{in front of you and}} what is happening behind you. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> run at the right time. I thought the No. 17 (Stenhouse) was going to get a little bit further out, but when we were coming to the line it just seemed like his car wasn’t going at that point, so it was a good finish. It was a great race. I’m glad everybody is okay, that was a really scary wreck on the backstretch, but really good day for our McDonald’s Chevrolet. We had good pit stops and the guys did a great job.” ...|$|E
5000|$|McCabe {{is the son}} of a {{bus driver}} father and a social worker mother and has two older brothers, Alan and Paul. When asked what it was that {{inspired}} him to become a guitarist, he answered: [...] "That was me, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> guitar, and I could play a few things on it, and I liked messing with it, and I liked making my own things up." [...] He attended Haydock High School, and later met Richard Ashcroft at Winstanley College. Ashcroft described McCabe's guitar playing as sounding like [...] "a whole other universe"; the two briefly played in a band whilst at college. After leaving college, McCabe began a career as a quantity surveyor. He later recalled: [...] "I hated it. I used to sit there all day scribbling in my pad thinking about guitar sounds." [...] He gave this up to be part of The Verve along with Ashcroft, Simon Jones and Peter Salisbury.|$|E

2500|$|At 96 by 78inches, The Gross Clinic {{is one of}} the artist's largest works, and {{considered}} by some to be his greatest.

Eakins borrowed it for subsequent exhibitions, where it drew strong reactions, such as that of the New York Daily Tribune, which both acknowledged and damned its powerful image, [...] "but the more one praises it, the more one must condemn its admission to a gallery where men and women of weak nerves must be compelled to look at it. [...] For not to look it is impossible...No purpose is gained by this morbid exhibition, no lesson taught—the painter shows his skill and the spectators' gorge rises at it—that is all."

It was another kind of album. It was more… I guess <b>I</b> was <b>just</b> expressing myself about everyday life and where I was at then—just emotionally, personally.
