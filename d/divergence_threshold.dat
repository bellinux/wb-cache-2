40|$|DNA metabarcoding is a {{promising}} method for describing communities and estimating biodiversity. This approach uses high-throughput sequencing of targeted markers to identify species {{in a complex}} sample. By convention, sequences are clustered at a predefined sequence <b>divergence</b> <b>threshold</b> (often 3 %) into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that serve {{as a proxy for}} species. However, variable levels of interspecific marker variation across taxonomic groups make clustering sequences from a phylogenetically diverse dataset into OTUs at a uniform threshold problematic. In this study, we use mock zooplankton communities to evaluate the accuracy of species richness estimates when following conventional protocols to cluster hypervariable sequences of the V 4 region of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (18 S) into OTUs. By including individually tagged single specimens and “populations” of various species in our communities, we examine the impact of intra- and interspecific diversity on OTU clustering. Communities consisting of single individuals per species generated a correspondence of 59 – 84 % between OTU number and species richness at a 3 % <b>divergence</b> <b>threshold.</b> However, when multiple individuals per species were included, the correspondence between OTU number and species richness dropped to 31 – 63 %. Our results suggest that intraspecific variation in this marker can often exceed 3 %, such that a single species does not always correspond to one OTU. We advocate the need to apply group-specific divergence thresholds when analyzing complex and taxonomically diverse communities, but also encourage the development of additional filtering steps that allow identification of artifactual rRNA gene sequences or pseudogenes that may generate spurious OTUs...|$|E

40|$|The Philippine Islands {{are one of}} {{the most}} biologically diverse archipelagoes in the world. Current taxonomy, however, may {{underestimate}} levels of avian diversity and endemism in these islands. Although species limits can be difficult to determine among allopatric populations, quantitative methods for comparing phenotypic and genotypic data can provide useful metrics of divergence among populations and identify those that merit consideration for elevation to full species status. Using a conceptual approach that integrates genetic and phenotypic data, we compared populations among 48 species, estimating genetic divergence (p-distance) using the mtDNA marker ND 2 and comparing plumage and morphometrics of museum study skins. Using conservative speciation thresholds, pairwise comparisons of genetic and phenotypic divergence suggested possible species-level divergences in more than half of the species studied (25 out of 48). In speciation process space, divergence routes were heterogeneous among taxa. Nearly all populations that surpassed high genotypic <b>divergence</b> <b>thresholds</b> were Passeriformes, and non-Passeriformes populations surpassed high phenotypic <b>divergence</b> <b>thresholds</b> more commonly than expected by chance. Overall, there was an apparent logarithmic increase in phenotypic divergence with respect to genetic divergence, suggesting the possibility that divergence among these lineages may initially be driven by divergent selection in this allopatric system. Also, genetic endemism was high among sampled islands. Higher taxonomy affected divergence in genotype and phenotype. Although broader lineage, genetic, phenotypic, and numeric sampling is needed to further explore heterogeneity among divergence processes and to accurately assess species-level diversity in these taxa, our results support the need for substantial taxonomic revisions among Philippine birds. The conservation implications are profound...|$|R

Severe weather events are pinpointed using tornado and hail reports and correlating them with NEXRAD radar data to determine maximum intensity of the event. Severe storms that occur within 30 minutes of a model forecast hour are catalogued for further investigation. Once these events are diagnosed, ETA- 212 and MM 5 model data is regridded, centered on the storm. Divergence values at 300 hPa are extracted from the model data for each storm event. These storms are then grouped in three ways: all storms, tornadic storms, and hail producing storms. The averaged maximum divergence values from the ETA- 212 for each group are examined from the 0 hour analysis through the 21 hour forecast.

40|$|International audienceGenetic {{approaches}} to exploring in situ marine phytoplankton assemblages have revealed previously unsuspected diversity at different taxonomic levels. However, the phylogenetic species concept {{has rarely been}} compared to classical morphologically based taxonomy, which forms the basis of most current ecological, physiological, and paleontological knowledge of phytoplankton. Here we use the coccolithophores {{as a case study}} to test the relationship between these two taxonomic approaches. Analysis of 217 coccolithophore LSU rDNA sequences and 729 specimens observed by light and electron microscopy obtained from three water samples (Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean and Mediterranean Sea) demonstrated that parallel analysis of morphological and genetic data highlights limitations inherent to each approach. Combined morpho-genetic analyses increase the scope of description of the composition, richness and structure of natural coccolithophore communities. Overall, genetic determined diversity exceeded morphological determined diversity, which may partly reflect methodological biases, but also probably reflects cryptic speciation and/or the presence of lightly- or non-calcifying species (or life cycle stages) within the coccolithophore clade. Focusing on six coccolithophore family or order level subgroups, we show that the genetic diversity within established morphospecies varied significantly in different environments. Critically, we find that the <b>divergence</b> <b>threshold</b> at which phylospecies corresponded to morphospecies varied between different natural communities, a factor that may have important implications with respect to evaluation of diversity by metagenomics approaches...|$|E

Much previous work has been done in Churchill to study the Daphnia pulex species complex in particular, but no study has completed a wide-scale survey on the crustacean species that inhabit Churchill’s aquatic ecosystems using molecular markers. We have employed DNA barcoding to study the diversity of the Branchiopoda (Crustacea) in {{a wide variety of}} freshwater habitats and to determine the likely origins of the Churchill fauna following the last glaciation. The standard animal barcode marker (COI) was sequenced for 327 specimens, and a 3 % <b>divergence</b> <b>threshold</b> was used to delineate potential species.

40|$|The role of DNA barcoding {{as a tool}} to {{accelerate}} the inventory and analysis of diversity for hyperdiverse arthropods is tested using ants in Madagascar. We demonstrate how DNA barcoding helps address the failure of current inventory methods to rapidly respond to pressing biodiversity needs, specifically in the assessment of richness and turnover across landscapes with hyperdiverse taxa. In a comparison of inventories at four localities in northern Madagascar, patterns of richness were not significantly different when richness was determined using morphological taxonomy (morphospecies) or sequence <b>divergence</b> <b>thresholds</b> (Molecular Operational Taxonomic Unit(s); MOTU). However, sequence-based methods tended to yield greater richness and significantly lower indices of similarity than morphological taxonomy. MOTU determined using our molecular technique were a remarkably local phenomenon—indicative of highly restricted dispersal and/or long-term isolation. In cases where molecular and morphological methods differed in their assignment of individuals to categories, the morphological estimate was always more conservative than the molecular estimate. In those cases where morphospecies descriptions collapsed distinct molecular groups, sequence divergences of 16 % (on average) were contained within the same morphospecies.

40|$|Shark {{fisheries}} worldwide {{are mostly}} unmanaged, but the burgeoning shark fin {{industry in the}} last few decades has made monitoring catch and trade of these animals critical. As a tool for molecular species identification, DNA barcoding offers significant potential. However, the genetic distance-based approach towards species identification employed by the Barcode of Life Data Systems may oftentimes lack the specificity needed for regulatory or legal applications that require unambiguous identification results. This is because such specificity is not typically realized by anything less than a 100 % match of the query sequence to an entry in the reference database using genetic distance. Although various <b>divergence</b> <b>thresholds</b> have been proposed to define acceptable levels of intraspecific variation, enough exceptions exist to cast reasonable doubt on many less than exact matches using a distance-based approach for the identification of unknowns. An alternative approach relies on the identification of discrete molecular characters {{that can be used to}} unambiguously diagnose species. The objective of this study was to assess the performance differences between these competing approaches by examining more than 1000 DNA barcodes representing nearly 20 % of all known elasmobranch species.

Our {{results indicate that the}} 18 S rRNA gene is a good molecular marker for the study of copepod biodiversity, and our conclusions are as follows: 1) 18 S rRNA genes are highly conserved intra-species (intra-species similarities are close to 100 %); and could aid in species-level analyses, but with some limitations; 2) nearly-whole-length sequences and some partial regions (around V 2, V 4, and V 9) of the 18 S rRNA gene can be used to discriminate between samples at both the family and order levels (with a success rate of about 80 %); 3) compared with other regions, V 9 has a higher resolution at the genus level (with an identification success rate of about 80 %); and 4) V 7 is most divergent in length, and would be a good candidate marker for the phylogenetic study of Acartia species. This study also evaluated the correlation between similarity thresholds and the accuracy of using nuclear 18 S rRNA genes for the classification of organisms in the subclass Copepoda.

40|$|Hyperspectral LiDAR (HSL) {{is a novel}} tool in {{the field}} of active remote sensing, which has been widely used in many domains because of its {{advantageous}} ability of spectrum-gained. Especially in the precise monitoring of nitrogen in green plants, the HSL plays a dispensable role. The exiting HSL system used for nitrogen status monitoring has a multi-channel detector, which can improve the spectral resolution and receiving range, but maybe result in data redundancy, difficulty in system integration and high cost as well. Thus, it is necessary and urgent to pick out the nitrogen-sensitive feature wavelengths among the spectral range. The present study, aiming at solving this problem, assigns a feature weighting to each centre wavelength of HSL system by using matrix coefficient analysis and <b>divergence</b> <b>threshold.</b> The feature weighting is a criterion to amend the centre wavelength of the detector to accommodate different purpose, especially the estimation of leaf nitrogen content (LNC) in rice. By this way, the wavelengths high-correlated to the LNC can be ranked in a descending order, which are used to estimate rice LNC sequentially. In this paper, a HSL system which works based on a wide spectrum emission and a 32 -channel detector is conducted to collect the reflectance spectra of rice leaf. These spectra collected by HSL cover a range of 538 nm – 910 nm with a resolution of 12 nm. These 32 wavelengths are strong absorbed by chlorophyll in green plant among this range. The relationship between the rice LNC and reflectance-based spectra is modeled using partial least squares (PLS) and support vector machines (SVMs) based on calibration and validation datasets respectively. The results indicate that I) wavelength selection method of HSL based on feature weighting is effective to choose the nitrogen-sensitive wavelengths, which can also be co-adapted with the hardware of HSL system friendly. II) The chosen wavelength has a high correlation with rice LNC which can be retrieved by using PLS and SVMs regression methods...|$|E

The major goals of the present work were to: a) conduct the largest species-level barcoding study of the Muscidae to date and characterize the range of genetic divergence values in the northern Nearctic fauna; b) evaluate the correspondence between morphospecies and barcode groupings defined using both clustering-based and threshold-based approaches; and c) use the reference library produced to address taxonomic issues. Results Our data set included 1114 individuals and their COI sequences (951 from Churchill, Manitoba), representing 160 morphologically-determined species from 25 genera, covering 89 % of the known fauna of Churchill and 23 % of the Nearctic fauna. Following an iterative process through which all specimens belonging to taxa with anomalous divergence values and/or monophyly issues were re-examined, identity was modified for 9 taxa, including the reinstatement of Phaonia luteva (Walker) stat. nov. as a species distinct from Phaonia errans (Meigen). In the post-reassessment data set, no distinct gap was found between maximum pairwise intraspecific distances (range 0. 00 - 3. 01 %) and minimum interspecific distances (range: 0. 77 - 11. 33 %). Nevertheless, using a clustering-based approach, all individuals within 98 % of species grouped with their conspecifics with high (> 95 %) bootstrap support; in contrast, a maximum species discrimination rate of 90 % was obtained at the optimal threshold of 1. 2 %. DNA barcoding enabled the determination of females from 5 ambiguous species pairs and confirmed that 16 morphospecies were genetically distinct from named taxa. There were morphological differences among all distinct genetic clusters; thus, no cases of cryptic species were detected. Conclusions Our findings reveal the great utility of building a well-populated, species-level reference barcode database against which to compare unknowns. When such a library is unavailable, {{it is still possible}} to obtain a fairly accurate (within ~ 10 %) rapid assessment of species richness based upon a barcode <b>divergence</b> <b>threshold</b> alone, but this approach is most accurate when the threshold is tuned to a particular taxon. </p...|$|E

Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are classified into two species, species A and B, which contain over 100 serotypes, and a recently discovered genetically hetero-geneous third species (HRV species C). To investigate their diversity and population turnover, screening for the detection and the genetic characterization of HRV variants in diagnostic respiratory samples was performed by using nested primers for the efficient amplification of the VP 4 -VP 2 region of HRV (and enterovirus) species and serotype identification. HRV species A, B, and C variants were detected in 14 %, 1. 8 %, and 6. 8 %, respectively, of 456 diagnostic respiratory samples from 345 subjects (6 samples also contained enteroviruses), predominantly among children under age 10 years.

We here examine an array of factors affecting GMYC resolution (tree reconstruction method, taxon sampling coverage/taxon richness and geographic sampling intensity/geographic scale). We test GMYC performance based on empirical data (DNA barcoding of the Romanian butterflies) on a solid taxonomic framework (i. e. all species are thought to be described and can be determined with independent sources of evidence). The data set is comprehensive (176 species), and intensely and homogeneously sampled (1303 samples representing the main populations of butterflies in this country). Taxonomy was assessed based on morphology, including linear and geometric morphometry when needed. The number of GMYC entities obtained constantly exceeds the total number of morphospecies in the data set. We show that c. 80 % of the species studied are recognized as entities by GMYC. Interestingly, we show that this percentage is practically the maximum that a single-threshold method can provide for this data set. Thus, the c. 20 % of failures are attributable to intrinsic properties of the COI polymorphism: overlap in inter- and intraspecific divergences and non-monophyly of the species likely because of introgression or lack of independent lineage sorting. Our results demonstrate that this method is remarkably stable under a wide array of circumstances, including most phylogenetic reconstruction methods, high singleton presence (up to 95 %), taxon richness (above five species) and the presence of gaps in intraspecific sampling coverage (removal of intermediate haplotypes). Hence, the method is useful to designate an optimal <b>divergence</b> <b>threshold</b> in an objective manner and to pinpoint potential cryptic species that are worth being studied in detail. However, the existence of a substantial percentage of species wrongly delimited indicates that GMYC cannot be used as sufficient evidence for evaluating the specific status of particular cases without additional data.

40|$|Background] Due {{to their}} great species and {{ecological}} diversity {{as well as}} their capacity to produce hundreds of different toxins, cone snails are of interest to evolutionary biologists, pharmacologists and amateur naturalists alike. Taxonomic identification of cone snails still relies mostly on the shape, color, and banding patterns of the shell. However, these phenotypic traits are prone to homoplasy. Therefore, the consistent use of genetic data for species delimitation and phylogenetic inference in this apparently hyperdiverse group is largely wanting. Here, we reconstruct the phylogeny of the cones endemic to Cabo Verde archipelago, a well-known radiation of the group, using mitochondrial (mt) genomes. [Results] The reconstructed phylogeny grouped the analyzed species into two main clades, one including Kalloconus from West Africa sister to Trovaoconus from Cabo Verde and the other with a paraphyletic Lautoconus due to the sister group relationship of Africonus from Cabo Verde and Lautoconus ventricosus from Mediterranean Sea and neighboring Atlantic Ocean to the exclusion of Lautoconus endemic to Senegal (plus Lautoconus guanche from Mauritania, Morocco, and Canary Islands). Within Trovaoconus, up to three main lineages could be distinguished. The clade of Africonus included four main lineages (named I to IV), each further subdivided into two monophyletic groups. The reconstructed phylogeny allowed inferring the evolution of the radula in the studied lineages as well as biogeographic patterns. The number of cone species endemic to Cabo Verde was revised under the light of sequence divergence data and the inferred phylogenetic relationships. [Conclusions] The sequence divergence between continental members of the genus Kalloconus and island endemics ascribed to the genus Trovaoconus is low, prompting for synonymization of the latter. The genus Lautoconus is paraphyletic. Lautoconus ventricosus is the closest living sister group of genus Africonus. Diversification of Africonus was in allopatry due to the direct development nature of their larvae and mainly triggered by eustatic sea level changes during the Miocene-Pliocene. Our study confirms the diversity of cone endemic to Cabo Verde but significantly reduces the number of valid species.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to develop a {{computer}} assisted tissue classification (granulation, necrotic, and slough) scheme for chronic wound (CW) evaluation using medical image processing and statistical machine learning techniques. The red-green-blue (RGB) wound images grabbed by normal digital camera were first transformed into HSI (hue, saturation, and intensity) color space and subsequently the “S” component of HSI color channels was selected as it provided higher contrast. Wound areas from 6 different types of CW were segmented from whole images using fuzzy <b>divergence</b> based <b>thresholding</b> by minimizing edge ambiguity. A set of color and textural features describing granulation, necrotic, and slough tissues in the segmented wound area were extracted using various mathematical techniques. Finally, statistical learning algorithms, namely, Bayesian classification and support vector machine (SVM), were trained and tested for wound tissue classification in different CW images. The performance of the wound area segmentation protocol was further validated by ground truth images labeled by clinical experts. It was observed that SVM with 3 rd order polynomial kernel provided the highest accuracies, that is, 86. 94 %, 90. 47 %, and 75. 53 %, for classifying granulation, slough, and necrotic tissues, respectively. The proposed automated tissue classification technique achieved the highest overall accuracy, that is, 87. 61 %, with highest kappa statistic value (0. 793) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{study is}} {{described}} in which optimal textural and spectral features are selected for scene segmentation. A set of 46 textural features and 3 spectral features were available for image classification. A method was developed which used a thresholded separability measure to select the best features for scene segmentation. The measure {{was based on the}} Mahalanobis distance between class means. The optimal feature selection process was applied to a variety of images and classification results using 4 features ranged from 91 % to 97 % with independent data sets. The use of the thresholded Mahalanobis-like distance for optimal feature selection was compared to the more common <b>thresholded</b> <b>divergence</b> separability measure and was found to choose features which were equally good for classification. The Mahalanobis-like measure had the additional advantage of using only 1 / 6 the time needed to calculate the divergence measure...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{determine}} optimal spectral band sets for {{the exploitation of}} multispectral and hyperspectral imagery is of great concern due to data transfer, storage, and computational constraints. This study compares the performance of three band selection techniques {{across a range of}} scenarios and image exploitation algorithms. <b>Thresholded</b> <b>Divergence,</b> a technique based on Gaussian Maximum Likelihood classification, Forward Sequential Band Selection, an iterative method based on target identification algorithms, and Spectral Basis Functions, a method independent of end-exploitation, were selected for evaluation. Each of these band selection techniques was applied to two M 7 multispectral images and two HYDICE hyperspectral images. Each selected optimal spectral band set for each image was classified and assessed for classification accuracy. Comparisons between band selection techniques were made based on spectral band subset size, image exploitation algorithm, image and scene type, and input parameter set...|$|R
40|$|As {{the largest}} and the basal-most family of conifers, Pinaceae {{provides}} key insights into the evolutionary history of conifers. We present comparative chloroplast genomics and analysis of concatenated 49 chloroplast protein-coding genes common to 19 gymnosperms, including 15 species from 8 Pinaceous genera, to address the long-standing controversy about Pinaceae phylogeny. The complete cpDNAs of Cathaya argyrophylla and Cedrus deodara (Abitoideae) and draft cpDNAs of Larix decidua, Picea morrisonicola, and Pseudotsuga wilsoniana are reported. We found 21 - and 42 -kb inversions in congeneric species and different populations of Pinaceous species, which indicates that structural polymorphics may be common and ancient in Pinaceae. Our phylogenetic analyses reveal that Cedrus is clustered with Abies–Keteleeria rather than the basal-most genus of Pinaceae and that Cathaya is closer to Pinus than to Picea or Larix–Pseudotsuga. Topology and structural change tests and indel-distribution comparisons lend further evidence to our phylogenetic finding. Our molecular datings suggest that Pinaceae first evolved during Early Jurassic, and diversification of Pinaceous subfamilies and genera took place during Mid-Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous, respectively. Using different maximum-likelihood <b>divergences</b> as <b>thresholds,</b> we conclude that 2 (Abietoideae and Larix–Pseudotsuga–Piceae–Cathaya–Pinus), 4 (Cedrus, non-Cedrus Abietoideae, Larix–Pseudotsuga, and Piceae–Cathaya–Pinus), or 5 (Cedrus, non-Cedrus Abietoideae, Larix–Pseudotsuga, Picea, and Cathaya–Pinus) groups/subfamilies are more reasonable delimitations for Pinaceae. Specifically, our views on subfamilial classifications differ from previous studies {{in terms of the}} rank of Cedrus and with recognition of more than two subfamilies...|$|R
40|$|Conventionally {{decision}} {{trees are}} fixed structures for sequential classification, which {{are designed for}} certain regions and specific research questions. In heterogeneous and dynamic urban environments their broad application requires a continual change of their structure, which is time consuming and laborintensive.

The platform of the user interface is composed of fixed feature sets which are equally applied to all scenes. They are {{selected on the basis of}} the Transformed <b>Divergence.</b> The features’ <b>thresholds</b> are connected to controllers, which can be adapted by the user. For assessing the effectiveness of the user interface, its classification performance is compared to the one of a decision tree with fixed thresholds.

40|$|Background: Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves {{are being}} used to {{identify}} Minimally Important Change (MIC) thresholds on scales that measure a change in health status. In quasi-continuous patient reported outcome measures, such as those that measure changes in chronic diseases with variable clinical trajectories, sensitivity and specificity are often valued equally. Notwithstanding methodologists agreeing that these should be valued equally, different approaches have been taken to estimating MIC thresholds using ROC curves. Aims and objectives: We aimed to compare the different approaches used with a new approach, exploring {{the extent to which the}} methods choose different thresholds, and considering the effect of differences on conclusions in responder analyses. Methods: Using graphical methods, hypothetical data, and data from a large randomised controlled trial of manual therapy for low back pain, we compared two existing approaches with a new approach that is based on the addition of the sums of squares of 1 -sensitivity and 1 -specificity. Results: There can be <b>divergence</b> in the <b>thresholds</b> chosen by different estimators. The cut-point selected by different estimators is dependent on the relationshi...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{investigate}} the optical properties of proton-implanted photonic crystal (PhC) vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) emitting in the visible spectrum. The fabricated lasers have a threshold current of 1. 3 mA and single-mode output power greater than 1 mW at room temperature. The incorporation of a PhC {{into the top}} facet of a proton-implanted VCSEL results in a stable single-fundamental-mode operation with a side-mode sup-pression ratio larger than 30 dB and a constant beam divergence in-dependent of injection current level or ambient temperature. Using an index-step optical fiber model, we compare the effects of differ-ent hole etching depths to variations in output beam divergence. By varying the design and etching depth of the hole pattern, the lasers can either be optimized for low beam <b>divergence</b> or low <b>threshold</b> currents. The controllable refractive index guidance effect from the PhC allows for precise engineering of the optical properties of these visible VCSELs for consumer and imaging applications.

40|$|The X(3872) {{seems to}} be a loosely-bound hadronic {{molecule}} whose constituents are two charm mesons. A novel feature of this molecule is that the mass difference of the constituents is close to the mass of a lighter meson that can be exchanged between them, namely the pion. We analyze this feature in a simple model with spin- 0 mesons only. Various observables are calculated to next-to-leading order in the interaction strength of the exchanged meson. Renormalization requires summing a geometric series of next-to-leading order corrections. The dependence of observables on the ultraviolet cutoff can be removed by renormalizations of the mass of the heaviest meson, the coupling constant for the contact interaction between the heavy mesons, and short-distance coefficients in the operator product expansion. The next-to-leading order correction has an unphysical infrared <b>divergence</b> at the <b>threshold</b> of the two heavier mesons that can be eliminated by a further resummation that takes into account the nonzero width of the heaviest meson.
