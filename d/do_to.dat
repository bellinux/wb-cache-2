5|$|As {{opposed to}} film makers, virtual camera system creators {{have to deal}} with a world that is {{interactive}} and unpredictable. It is not possible to know where the player's character {{is going to be in}} the next few seconds; therefore, it is not possible to plan the shots as a film maker would <b>do.</b> <b>To</b> solve this issue, the system relies on certain rules or artificial intelligence to select the most appropriate shots.|$|E
5|$|Before I {{had become}} {{familiar}} with my surroundings the President sent for me. In the interview that followed he told me what he wanted, and what the failures and his disappointments had been, and proceeded to advise me as to what I should <b>do</b> <b>to</b> accomplish the purpose determined upon {{in the way of}} the new coinage. In this talk he suggested some details of action of a drastic character for my guidance, which he was positive were necessary to be adopted before success could be had. All this was delivered in his usual vigorous way, emphasizing many points by hammering on the desk with his fist.|$|E

Second, {{she was in love}} with Angel, and I always viewed Darla as the jilted ex-wife that could never get over being dumped. If you really look at her, you can have sympathy and empathy for her. In the beginning of her life she was a prostitute, Joss and I actually talked about that a lot, that she was probably abused growing up. She did what she needed to <b>do</b> <b>to</b> survive, she just lacked the people skills.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{insisted that}} there was nothing more they could <b>do</b> <b>to</b> deter Rhodesia directly; they had already {{threatened}} to expel Rhodesia's representative from the British Embassy in Washington, with no effect. The only open course therefore had to be to take a firmer line with Portugal. Two days later, on 7 September, Wilson discussed the matter with Hughes and Stewart, and agreed with their conclusions, telling them to proceed.|$|E
5|$|In 1881, a {{currency}} reform introduced a bimetallic standard, which {{went into effect}} in July 1883. Unlike many precious metal standards the system was very decentralized: no national monetary authority existed and all control over convertibility rested with the five banks of issue. The period of convertibility lasted only 17 months: from December 1884 the banks of issue refused to exchange gold at par for notes. The suspension of convertibility was soon accommodated by the government, since, having no institutional power over the monetary system, there was little they could <b>do</b> <b>to</b> prevent it.|$|E

5|$|In 1954, India {{arranged}} to purchase Hunters {{as a part}} of a wider arms deal with Britain, ordering 140 Hunter single-seat fighters at the same time that Pakistan announced its purchase of several North American F-86 Sabre jet fighters. The Indian Air Force (IAF) was the first to operate the Hunter T.66 trainers, placing an initial order in 1957. The more powerful engine was considered beneficial in a hot environment, allowing for greater takeoff weights. During the 1960s, Pakistan investigated the possibility of buying as many as 40 English Electric Lightnings, but Britain was unenthusiastic about the potential sales opportunity because of the damage it would <b>do</b> <b>to</b> its relations with India, which at the time was still awaiting the delivery of large numbers of ex-RAF Hunters.|$|E
5|$|In a {{revision}} of basal Dinosauria, Padian and May (1993) discussed {{the definition of the}} clade, and redefined it as the latest common ancestor of Triceratops and birds. They also discussed what this definition would <b>do</b> <b>to</b> the most basal taxa, such as Herrerasauridae, and Eoraptor. Padian and May considered that since both Herrerasauridae and Eoraptor lack many diagnostic features of Saurischia or Ornithischia, that they could not be considered inside Dinosauria.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} game Georgia Tech {{defeated}} Furman 25–0, playing mainly substitutes. Hay was spread on the field {{in an attempt to}} counteract the steady downpour. Tech quarterback Al Hill scored two touchdowns, and Dan Whelchel (called Walthall) scored a third when he recovered a fumble by Theodore Shaver after crossing the goal line. Although Furman's lineup included future South Carolina Hall-of-Famer Speedy Speer, there was little Speer could <b>do</b> <b>to</b> affect the outcome. Tech's starting lineup was Ulrich (left end), Higgins (left tackle), Whelchel (left guard), Johnson (center), Wright (right guard), Doyle (right tackle), Colcord (right end), Hill (quarterback), Smith (left halfback), Shaver (right halfback), and Harlan (fullback).|$|E

5|$|Joel (Troy Baker) is {{the protagonist}} of The Last of Us. Originally from Texas, Joel was a single father in his late 20s when the initial Cordyceps {{outbreak}} occurred. Fleeing with his brother Tommy and his twelve-year-old daughter Sarah, they got involved in a firefight with a soldier, and Sarah was mortally wounded and died in his arms, leaving him traumatized. In the 20 years that follow, Joel did whatever he had to <b>do</b> <b>to</b> survive. In the {{time spent in the}} brutal post-apocalyptic world, still bitter from his daughter's death, Joel became a hardened survivor, physically and mentally tough. He has a brutal fighting style and is capable of taking on and defeating much younger men in hand-to-hand combat.|$|E

Michael sets up a meeting with a potential investor and makes a list of potential salesmen to join the company. He receives a letter from his realtor saying that running a business from his condominium is in violation of his residence agreement, so he needs to find office space for the company. Michael and Pam leave to find potential salesmen and then have their meeting with the potential investor.|$|E
5|$|Some {{types of}} organochlorides, though not all, have {{significant}} toxicity to plants or animals, including humans. Dioxins, produced when organic matter is {{burned in the}} presence of chlorine, and some insecticides, such as DDT, are persistent organic pollutants which pose dangers when they are released into the environment. For example, DDT, which was widely used to control insects in the mid 20th century, also accumulates in food chains, and causes reproductive problems (e.g., eggshell thinning) in certain bird species. Due to the ready homolytic fission of the C–Cl bond to create chlorine radicals in the upper atmosphere, chlorofluorocarbons have been phased out due to the harm they <b>do</b> <b>to</b> the ozone layer.|$|E

5|$|The NZRFU named Gallaher captain for the tour, with Billy Stead as vice-captain. A week {{into the}} voyage to Britain aboard the SS Rumutaka, rumours {{circulated}} {{that some of}} the southern players were unhappy with the appointment of Gallaher, and with what they perceived as an Auckland bias in the squad. The dissidents contended that the captain and vice-captain should have been elected by the players, as they had been on the 1897 and 1903 tours to Australia. Gallaher recognised the damage factionalism might <b>do</b> <b>to</b> the team and offered to resign, as did the vice-captain Stead. Although the teams' manager refused to accept the resignations, the players still took a vote—17 out of 29 endorsed the NZRFU's selections.|$|E

A hostile alien invader known as Captain Kabuki (voiced by Lorelei King) descends upon Little Muu and starts taking it apart, piece by piece, contrasting on what Aloha himself had once tried to <b>do</b> <b>to</b> Crater Planet in the first game. Aloha flees the onslaught in his space pod, and lands on an asteroid far away from Little Muu, where he calls for help from his sworn enemy, Universal City Hall. Once again, Robbit is dispatched to help, and manages to free the parts of Little Muu which Kabuki has taken, and ultimately faces Kabuki one-on-one in mortal combat. Robbit defeats Kabuki, resulting in the latter escaping.|$|E
