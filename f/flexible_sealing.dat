50|$|Diving bells {{have been}} used for {{submarine}} rescue. The closed dry bell is designed to seal against the deck of the submarine above an escape hatch. Water in the space between the bell and the submarine is pumped out and the hatches can be opened to allow occupants to leave the submarine and enter the bell. The hatches are then closed, the bell skirt flooded to release it from the submarine, and the bell with its load of survivors is hoisted back to the surface, where the survivors exit and the bell may return for the next group. The internal pressure in the bell is usually kept at atmospheric pressure to minimise run time by eliminating the need for decompression, so the seal between the bell skirt and the submarine deck is critical to the safety of the operation. This seal is provided by using a <b>flexible</b> <b>sealing</b> material, usually a type of rubber, which is pressed firmly against the smooth hatch surround by the pressure differential when the skirt is pumped out.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIntroductionBefore IS- 1 (3. 2 mm) {{standardization}} of pacemaker leads and connectors, 5 / 6 mm connector ports accomodated 5 mm or 6 mm diameter lead connector pins. Case reportA patient with sick sinus syndrome underwent implantation of a 5 mm unipolar atrial lead, mated to a 5 / 6 mm connector port Medtronic Spectrax Sx 5985 pacemaker. Pulse generator reached ERI in 2006, with change {{out to a}} Medtronic Sigma SSR 306 (5 / 6 mm connector port) and preservation of the 5 mm lead. She was admitted in 2010 for atrial lead non capture from blood leak and corrosion of the header-connector pin apparatus. Discussion 5 / 6 mm pacemaker header ports have a 5 mm <b>flexible</b> <b>sealing</b> ring at the port entrance to seal 5 mm or 6 mm lead connector pins. The inner barrel diameter of the connector port is 6 mm and insertion of a 5 mm lead results in a 0. 5 mm tolerance circumferentially. Should the seal be compromised, blood can corrode the apparatus. To minimize this, we can employ (a) a cinching tie to further seal the silicone ring (b) universal adaptor sleeves (c) splice kits (d) lead adaptor kits. Aging leads, adaptor kits or sleeves themselves can result in lead failure. It may be safer to re-implant the entire system. ConclusionA 5 / 6 mm configuration pacemaker header connector port allows for significant tolerances when a 5 mm lead is used. Consideration {{must be made to}} prevent leaks...|$|E
40|$|TutorialFlexible sealing elements, {{typically}} elastomeric O-rings {{are commonly}} used to contain fluids within pressurized cavities of turbomachinery at the interfaces between adjoining components. All too often the only selection criteria applied for these sealing element is chemical resistance and a check that the service conditions are within the published temperature limits for the material being considered. This seemingly simplistic selection process can be complicated when the fluid in question, comprised of numerous constituents that dictate several different elastomeric materials, would normally be the optimal selection. Furthermore {{in the case of}} duties where the fluid (typically gas) pressure is elevated, some additional considerations also become more prominent due to explosive decompression (ED) damage that can occur during rapid depressurization events in the pressurized system. Despite the effects of ED being well documented, there is still a relative lack of understanding regarding what makes a sealing device ?ED resistant? and why. This tutorial goes through the composition of <b>flexible</b> <b>sealing</b> element materials and how they compare with a more widely understood engineering material; steel. It also focuses on sizing issues and international standards and how they are applied in given applications. Thermal considerations will also be addressed and an appreciation of the methods used to test such materials will be covered. In addition to ED topics being fully addressed there will also be other issues covered such as storage and longevity, modulus, strength, hardness, elongation, compression set, and stress relaxation. Lastly, although this tutorial focuses mainly on O-rings it can equally be applied to any elastomeric sealing material used in the turbomachinery industry...|$|E
