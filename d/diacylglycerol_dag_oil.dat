DAG oil was evaluated in healthy cats and in a feline model of hypertriglyceridemia as a result of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) deficiency. In the first study, eight adult cats were offered a commercial dry diet enriched with either DAG or triglyceride (TAG) oil (48 % metabolizable energy [ME] from fat) in a two-bowl palatability feeding trial. After 14 days, total food intakes were similar (DAG diet 470 ± 52 g, TAG diet 380 ± 88 g, P = 0. 4). Both diets were well-accepted and no changes in health or fecal quality were observed. In the second study, eleven adult LPL-deficient male cats were fed a semipurified diet containing either DAG or TAG oil as the sole fat source (25 % ME) in a crossover design for 8 days each after a 21 -day acclimation period. Serum concentrations of TAG, cholesterol, and nonesterified fatty acids were measured on days 6, 7, 8 and days 14, 15, 16. No significant effects were observed on any measurements, and a reduction in hypertriglyceridemia was not demonstrated (DAG: 3282 ± 400 mg/dl, TAG: 3001 ± 302 mg/dl). Dietary fat source did not significantly affect food intake, body weight, fecal quality, or general health.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Characteristics for the {{serum lipid}} {{abnormalities}} in the obesity/metabolic syndrome are elevated fasting, postprandial triglyceride (TG), and decreased high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C). <b>Diacylglycerol</b> (<b>DAG)</b> <b>oil</b> ingestion {{has been reported}} to ameliorate postprandial hyperlipidemia and prevent obesity by increasing energy expenditure, due to the intestinal physiochemical dynamics that differ from triacylglycerol (TAG). Our study demonstrated that DAG suppresses postprandial increase in TG-rich lipoprotein, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), and insulin, as compared with TAG in young, healthy individuals. Interestingly, our study also presented that DAG significantly increases plasma serotonin, which is mostly present in the intestine, and mediates thermogenesis, proposing a possible mechanism for a postprandial increase in energy expenditure by DAG. Our other study demonstrated that DAG suppresses postprandial increase in TG, VLDL-C, and remnant-like particle-cholesterol, in comparison with TAG in an apolipoprotein C-II deficient subject, suggesting that DAG suppresses postprandial TG-rich lipoprotein independently of lipoprotein lipase. Further, to understand the molecular mechanisms for DAG-mediated increase in serotonin and energy expenditure, we studied the effects of 1 -monoacylglycerol and 2 (1) : 1 - 10 2 -monoacylglycerol, distinct digestive products of DAG and TAG, respectively, on serotonin release from the Caco- 2 cells, the human intestinal cell line. We also studied effects of 1 - and 2 -monoacylglycerol, and serotonin on the expression of mRNA associated with â-oxidation, fatty acids metabolism, and thermogenesis, in the Caco- 2 cells. 1 -monoacylglycerol significantly increased serotonin release from the Caco- 2 cells, compared with 2 -monoacylglycerol by approximately 40 %. The expression of mRNA of acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO), fatty acid translocase (FAT), and uncoupling protein- 2 (UCP- 2), was significantly higher in 1 -MOG-treated Caco- 2 cells, than 2 -MOG-treated cells. The expression of mRNA of ACO, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, FAT, and UCP- 2, was significantly elevated in serotonin-treated Caco- 2 cells, compared to cells incubated without serotonin. In conclusion, our clinical and in vitro studies suggested a possible therapeutic application of DAG for obesity, and obesity-related metabolic disorders...|$|E

We have previously studied plasma serotonin, which increases EE and exists in the small intestine, in individuals who ingested TAG and DAG oil, and found that DAG ingestion elevates plasma serotonin levels by about 50 % compared with TAG ingestion. We studied the molecular mechanisms for DAG-mediated increase in serotonin and EE. Methods: We studied effects of 1 -monoacylglycerol and 2 -monoacylglycerol, distinct digestive products of DAG and TAG, respectively, on serotonin release from the Caco- 2 cells (the human intestinal cell line, n = 8). Further, we studied effects of 1 - and 2 -monoacylglycerol, and serotonin on expression of mRNA associated with &beta;-oxidation, FA metabolism, and thermogenesis, in the Caco- 2 cells (n = 5). Results: 1 -monoacylglycerol (100 &micro;M 1 -monooleyl glycerol [1 -MOG]) significantly increased serotonin release from the Caco- 2 cells compared with 2 -monoacylglycerol (100 &micro;M 2 -MOG) by 36. 6 %. Expression of mRNA of acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO), fatty acid translocase (FAT), and uncoupling protein- 2 (UCP- 2) were significantly higher in 100 &micro;M 1 -MOG-treated Caco- 2 cells than 100 &micro;M 2 -MOG-treated cells by 12. 8 %, 23. 7 %, and 35. 1 %, respectively. Further, expression of mRNA of ACO, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, FAT, and UCP- 2 were significantly elevated in serotonin (400 nM) -treated Caco- 2 cells compared with cells incubated without serotonin by 28. 7 %, 30. 1 %, and 39. 2 %, respectively. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that 1 -monoacylglycerol, a digestive product of DAG, increases serotonin release from the Caco- 2 cells, and enhances expression of genes associated with &beta;-oxidation, FA metabolism, and thermogenesis, and that serotonin increases expression of these genes, proposing a novel molecular mechanism for DAG-mediated promotion of negative caloric balance.
