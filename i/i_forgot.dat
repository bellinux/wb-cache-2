On March 30 of that year, President Reagan and three others were shot by troubled 25-year old John Hinckley, Jr as they left the Washington Hilton hotel. Nancy was alerted and arrived at George Washington University Hospital, where the President was hospitalized.

500|$|Drummer Lars Ulrich {{achieved}} a unique sound on St. Anger by {{turning off the}} snares on his snare drum resulting in a drum tone with far more [...] "ring" [...] than is usual in rock and metal. This sound received much backlash from fans and critics alike. Ulrich said, [...] "One day <b>I</b> <b>forgot</b> to turn the snare on because I wasn't thinking about this stuff. At the playbacks, I decided I was really liking what I was hearing—it had a different ambience. It sang back {{to me in a}} beautiful way."

[...] Rock said, [...] "I would say I've only [...] this brutal [...] when I've done demos.

500|$|Thomas disliked being {{regarded}} as a provincial poet, and decried any notion of 'Welshness' in his poetry.

I can't read Welsh." [...] Despite this his work was rooted in the geography of Wales. Thomas acknowledged that he returned to Wales when he had difficulty writing, and John Ackerman argues that [...] "His inspiration and imagination were rooted in his Welsh background". Caitlin Thomas wrote that he worked [...] "in a fanatically narrow groove, although there was nothing narrow about the depth and understanding of his feelings.

This includes an electric left-handed guitar, a shirt similar to Cobain's, and a blonde wig. The costuming for the performance is critical; Schwartz explained that [...] "if anything's missing, Al won't do it". The rest of Al's band also participates. Steve Jay, who plays bass, uses two bass straps to emulate and exaggerate [...] "Novoselic's low-hanging bass". He explained that he positions his instrument [...] "to where I can just barely touch the strings". The members of the band also mock-mosh. Jim West, the band's guitarist, noted that moshing is usually tame, but that there [...] "were a few collisions where people got hurt, but not the audience, just the band." [...] Sometimes during the third verse, after Yankovic sings [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>forgot</b> the next verse," [...] he drops out {{for the next few}} lines, pretending to actually forget the lyrics.|$|E

500|$|After {{his release}} Robert Dudley was short {{of money and}} he and Amy were helped out financially by their families. Their {{lifestyle}} had to remain modest, though, and Lord Robert (as he was known) was heaping up considerable debts. Sir John Robsart died in 1554; his wife {{followed him to the}} grave in the spring of 1557, which meant that the Dudleys could inherit the Robsart estate with the Queen's permission. Lady Amy's ancestral manor house of Syderstone had been uninhabitable for many decades, and the couple were now living in Throcking, Hertfordshire, at the house of William Hyde, when not in London. In August 1557 Robert Dudley went to fight for Philip II of Spain (who was then Mary I's husband) at the Battle of St. Quentin in France. From this time a business letter from Amy Dudley survives, settling some debts of her husband's in his absence, [...] "although <b>I</b> <b>forgot</b> to move my lord thereof before his departing, he being sore troubled with weighty affairs, and I not being altogether in quiet for his sudden departing".|$|E
500|$|While only {{a modest}} success with North American audiences, The Commitments has since been {{regarded}} as a cult film, {{and one of the}} best Irish films ever made.

In 2005, a poll conducted by Jameson Irish Whiskey ranked The Commitments the [...] "Best Irish Film of All time", based on 10,000 votes.

To Kwaak Je-yup of The Korea Times was positive about the performance of the song during the tour saying that, [...] "The highlight of the night was her first slow jam 'Hair,' which she introduced as her favorite track on the 'Born This Way' album... Playing the guitar-shaped keyboard, she flubbed her line once and admitted it right away — 'I'm getting too excited (that) <b>I</b> <b>forgot</b> my lines,' she said — but the moment made the experience personal." [...] On the second night of Gaga's show in the Philippines, she addressed the controversy directly before a slow-tempo version of [...] "Hair". While playing the piano she stated that she is aware of the issues around her image and music, she emphasized that she respects all kinds of religion, people and culture – including Filipino culture. She also said that she respects that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but stressed [...] "What I don’t respect is homophobia and hatred…I reject intolerance to the gay community." [...] This drew cheers from the audience.

500|$|Bond next {{created the}} role of Mad Margaret in Ruddigore (1887; {{originally}} spelt [...] "Ruddygore"), which she regarded as her favourite of all the Gilbert and Sullivan roles, [...] "for it gave me the chance to show what I really could do as an actress." [...] The part was her largest to date, and Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte made her audition it {{for them to be}} sure that she could handle the responsibility. [...] "It was an awful ordeal. [...] I saw the three white faces looming out of the darkness as they sat close together; criticizing me, talking me over, with cold managerial detachment. It nearly killed me. [...] Perhaps it gave an added realism and abandon to my simulated madness, for indeed I was nearly mad with fear – but at any rate I came through triumphantly, they were all three of them delighted." [...] Bond was particularly nervous on opening night. [...] "I shook and tottered so much that Mad Margaret's staff was no mere adjunct, but an absolute necessity. Without it I should have fallen as I stood in the wings waiting to go on. Then some one gave me a push; I was there, on the stage, in the glare of the footlights, hundreds of eyes fixed on me, tier upon tier of dim white faces rising from floor to ceiling in the gloom. It was enough; <b>I</b> <b>forgot</b> myself, I was Mad Margaret and no one else. I made an immense success." [...] Cellier and Bridgeman seconded this assessment: ...|$|E
500|$|The team, led by Joseph Giordano, cut off Reagan's [...] "thousand dollar" [...] {{custom-made}} suit {{to examine}} him, much to Reagan's anger. Military officers, {{including the one}} who carried the nuclear football, unsuccessfully tried to prevent FBI agents from confiscating the suit, Reagan's wallet, and other possessions as evidence; the Gold Codes card was in the wallet, and the FBI did not return it until two days later. The medical personnel found that Reagan's systolic blood pressure was 60 versus the normal 140, indicating {{that he was in}} shock, and knew that most 70-year-olds in the president's condition would not survive. Reagan was in excellent physical health, however, and also was shot by the [...]22 caliber instead of the larger [...]38 as was first feared. They treated him with intravenous fluids, oxygen, tetanus toxoid, and chest tubes, and surprised Parr—who still believed that he had cracked the president's rib—by finding the entrance gunshot wound. Brady and the wounded agent McCarthy were operated on near the president; when his wife arrived in the emergency room, Reagan remarked to her, [...] "Honey, <b>I</b> <b>forgot</b> to duck", borrowing boxer Jack Dempsey's line to his wife the night he was beaten by Gene Tunney. While intubated, he scribbled to a nurse, [...] "All in all, I'd rather be in Philadelphia", borrowing W. C. Fields' line. Although Reagan came close to death, the team's quick action—and Parr's decision to drive to the hospital instead of the White House—likely saved the president's life, and within 30 minutes Reagan left the emergency room for surgery with normal blood pressure.|$|E

In an article in the December 2004 edition of the {{magazine}} Royalty Digest: A Journal of Record Peter de Malama wrote that his cousin, Dmitri Yakovlevich Malama, an officer in the Imperial Russian Cavalry, met Tatiana when he was wounded in 1914 and a romance later developed between Tatiana and the young man when he was appointed an equerry to the court of the Tsar at Tsarskoye Selo. Dmitri Malama gave Tatiana a French bulldog she named [...] "Ortipo" [...] in September 1914. [...] "Forgive me about the little dog," [...] Tatiana wrote to her mother on 30 September 1914. [...] "To say the truth, when he asked should I like to have it if he gave it to me, I at once said yes. You remember, I always wanted to have one, and only afterwards when we came home I thought that suddenly you might not like me having one. But I really was so pleased at the idea that <b>I</b> <b>forgot</b> about everything." [...] The dog died, but Malama gave her a replacement puppy. Tatiana took it with her to Yekaterinburg, where it died {{with the rest of the}} family. Malama paid the imperial family a visit some eighteen months after he gave Tatiana the first dog. [...] "My little Malama came for an hour yesterday evening," [...] wrote Alexandra to Nicholas on 17 March 1916. [...] "...Looks flourishing more of a man now, an adorable boy still.
