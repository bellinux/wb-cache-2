40|$|This work {{covers the}} {{implementation}} of <b>filing</b> <b>service</b> in a municipal office and compares the real, current state with current legislation demands. The work is divided into 2 parts. The first part provides basic information about a selected municipal office and the character of currently used information system for <b>filing</b> <b>service.</b> Next this part describes individual activities being carried out {{in order to provide}} <b>filing</b> <b>service</b> and analyzes the life cycle of documents being processed in the municipal office. The second part of this work identifies significant changes in legislation, which influence individual activities of <b>filing</b> <b>service.</b> This enumeration serves as a basis for change proposals leading to the removal of flaws in processes as well as confusion in <b>filing</b> <b>service</b> managment in the municipal office. The main output of optimisation of <b>filing</b> <b>service</b> is altering the <b>filing</b> <b>service</b> managment according to the current <b>filing</b> <b>service</b> order in order to be in agreement with current legislation and the Ministry of Internal Affairs regulation...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of <b>filing</b> <b>service</b> and archival science. The theoretical part is focused on definition of the basic terms and contains a description of the document lifecycle. An {{important part of the}} <b>filing</b> <b>service</b> is the creation of the file which is governed by the applicable legislation. Life cycle of documents and files is ending within the shredding proces. The individual steps are described in the thesis. The practical part is focused on achieving of the targets in this thesis. It {{deals with the}} <b>filing</b> <b>service</b> of a specific public originator which is the Municipality of Kamenice nad Lipou. There is described the evolution <b>filing</b> <b>service</b> in the municipal office, the implementation of an electronic <b>filing</b> <b>service</b> system and start of data boxes operations. The goal of the thesis is valorize the benefits of the introduction of electronic <b>filing</b> <b>services</b> and if public originators can achieve savings due to this information technologies. There will be evaluated positives and negatives of both analog and electronic form <b>filing</b> <b>service</b> and whether all public originators are able to practice <b>filing</b> <b>services</b> by applicable laws...|$|R

It is based on IBM's high-performance shared-disk clustered file system GPFS. SoFS exports the clustered file system through industry standard protocols like SMB, NFS, FTP and HTTP. Released in 2007, SoFS is a second generation <b>file</b> <b>services</b> architecture used within IBM since 2001.|$|R

50|$|One initiative, IRS Free File, {{instructed}} the IRS to provide free and secure online tax return preparation and <b>filing</b> <b>services</b> to taxpayers. In accordance with this OMB directive, the IRS began working {{in partnership with}} the tax software industry to develop a solution. The result was the formation of the Free File Alliance, LLC, a group of tax software companies who provide free commercial online tax preparation and electronic <b>filing</b> <b>services.</b>|$|R
50|$|All of {{the work}} of searching the {{directory}} to figure out where the desired data was physically located on the disk was performed at high speed locally on the server.By the mid-1980s, most NOS products had shifted from the disk service to the <b>file</b> <b>service</b> model. Today, the disk service model is making a comeback, see SAN.|$|E
50|$|At {{the next}} level there are the servers. This is where nearly all the {{operating}} system functionality is located. User processes obtain <b>file</b> <b>service,</b> for example, by sending messages to the file server to open, close, read, and write files. In turn, the file server gets disk I/O performed by sending messages to the disk driver, which controls the disk.|$|E
5000|$|The name FSP was {{originally}} created without a real expansion. In 1993, discussions were held {{about what to}} expand the acronym to; the ultimate result was <b>File</b> <b>Service</b> Protocol. Other suggestions included File Slurping Protocol, FTP's Sexier Partner, and Flaky Stream Protocol. Due to its inherent low performance, FSP was sometimes colloquially said to stand for [...] "Fucking Slow Protocol" [...]|$|E
50|$|When {{designing}} the remote file server client for each conceptual interface {{you have to}} ask yourself the level of service your high level modules require (not necessary all of them) and not only how to implement the remote file server functionalities but maybe how to make the <b>file</b> <b>services</b> in your application compatibles between already implemented <b>file</b> <b>services</b> (local <b>files,</b> existing cloud clients) and your new remote file server client.|$|R

5000|$|<b>File</b> <b>Service</b> Protocol (FSP) is a UDP-based {{replacement}} for the File Transfer Protocol, designed for anonymous access with lower hardware and network requirements than FTP. In particular, because it uses UDP, it avoids the problems that many FTP servers have had with requiring a separate process for each client, [...] {{and because it is}} built to use an unreliable protocol, it can more easily handle resuming a transfer after a network failure.|$|E

WHO I catalogs important figures in economics, society, and politics, WHO II in academic research, literary, and journalism, and WHO III in arts, entertainment, and sports. The Sakka shippitsusha jinbutsu file compiles over 36,000 writers, critics, journalists, and researchers in {{humanities and social sciences}} from Meiji period to the present.

50|$|The Apple Filing Protocol (AFP), {{formerly}} AppleTalk Filing Protocol, is {{a proprietary}} network protocol, {{and part of}} the Apple <b>File</b> <b>Service</b> (AFS), that offers file services for macOS and the classic Mac OS. In macOS, AFP is one of several file services supported, with others including Server Message Block (SMB), Network File System (NFS), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), and WebDAV. AFP currently supports Unicode file names, POSIX and access control list permissions, resource forks, named extended attributes, and advanced file locking. In Mac OS 9 and earlier, AFP was the primary protocol for file services.|$|E
50|$|V {{was never}} {{an end in itself}} for the Stanford group; rather, it was used as a vehicle for many {{different}} research projects in distributed operating systems and networking. Much like other operating system efforts of its day (such as Sprite), V was a complete system that was mostly self hosting. Many students ran V as the only operating system on their diskless SUN workstations or MicroVAX workstations. Compiles could be done either on V itself or on VAX Unix machines that provided <b>file</b> <b>service</b> in a more stable environment than the ever-changing research system.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the raging}} debates of the 90s was {{whether it was}} more {{appropriate}} for network <b>file</b> <b>service</b> to be performed by a software layer running {{on top of a}} general purpose operating system, or by a special purpose operating system. NetWare was a special purpose operating system, not a timesharing OS. It was written from the ground up as a platform for client-server processing services. Initially it focused on file and print services, but later demonstrated its flexibility by running database, email, web and other services as well. It also performed efficiently as a router, supporting IPX, TCP/IP, and Appletalk, though it never offered the flexibility of a 'hardware' router.|$|E
