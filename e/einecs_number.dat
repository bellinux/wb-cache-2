50|$|Terbium-activated {{gadolinium}} oxysulfide {{is frequently}} {{used as a}} scintillator for x-ray imaging. It emits wavelengths between 382-622 nm, though the primary emission peak is at 545 nm. It is also used as a green phosphor in projection CRTs, though its drawback is marked lowering of efficiency at higher temperatures.http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5115306.html Variants include, for example, using praseodymium instead of terbium (CAS registry number , <b>EINECS</b> <b>number</b> 271-826-9), or using a mixture of dysprosium and terbium for doping (CAS number , <b>EINECS</b> <b>number</b> 271-824-8).|$|E
50|$|Oil Yellow DE is a {{synthetic}} greenish-yellow azo dye {{which has the}} appearance of a reddish yellow powder. Its <b>EINECS</b> <b>number</b> is 219-616-8.|$|E
50|$|The European List of Notified Chemical Substances (ELINCS) {{provides}} an <b>EINECS</b> <b>number.</b> The system {{was used by}} the European Union to identify commercially available chemical substances. Since 1 June 2007 EU Members, Liechtenstein, Iceland and Norway apply the REACH protocol (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation of Chemicals).|$|E
50|$|Bromine monochloride, {{also called}} bromine(I) chloride, bromochloride, and bromine chloride, is an interhalogen {{inorganic}} compound with chemical formula BrCl. It {{is a very}} reactive golden yellow gas with boiling point 5 °C and melting point −66 °C. Its CAS number is 13863-41-7 and its <b>EINECS</b> <b>number</b> is 237-601-4. It is a strong oxidizing agent.|$|E
50|$|Octadecyltrichlorosilane (ODTS, or n-octadecyltrichlorosilane) is an {{organometallic}} chemical. It {{is used in}} {{semiconductor industry}} to form self-assembled monolayer thin films on silicon dioxide substrates. Its structural chemical formula is CH3(CH2)17SiCl3. It is flammable, reacts with water, and is also sensitive to air. It is corrosive and can severely damage mucous membranes. Its <b>EINECS</b> <b>number</b> is 203-930-7.|$|E
50|$|Silica fume, {{also known}} as microsilica, (CAS number 69012-64-2, <b>EINECS</b> <b>number</b> 273-761-1) is an {{amorphous}} (non-crystalline) polymorph of silicon dioxide, silica. It is an ultrafine powder collected as a by-product of the silicon and ferrosilicon alloy production and consists of spherical particles with an average particle diameter of 150 nm. The main field of application is as pozzolanic material for high performance concrete.|$|E
30|$|REACH and in {{particular}} the classification, labelling, packaging (CLP) Regulation[37] base in general on the assumption that a substance has an intrinsic hazard profile independent from the manufacturing process. Thus, REACH information can be shared between the registrants of the substance, and the hazard classification based on the CLP Regulation should correspond (e.g. agreed entry, harmonised classification). However, this approach has limitations already for bulk materials. For example, bulk materials of the same substance can differ in their hazard profiles based on impurities or macroscopic particle size, leading to different classifications under the CLP Regulation. As already mentioned above, different nanomaterials of the same chemical composition often have very different properties and, subsequently, can differ in their hazard profile. This condition for instance can be utilised to define nanomaterials as substances on their own. In a paper from Competent Authorities for REACH and CLP (CARACAL), it is described that indeed in some cases the nanoform could be treated as a substance on its own: ‘In the case of substances at nanoscale, it is possible that some substances which in the past have been identified by the same <b>EINECS</b> <b>number</b> may have to be considered as different substances for the purpose of REACH’[38]. However, the paper does not provide criteria for this decision.|$|E
