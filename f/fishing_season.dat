5|$|Chew Valley Lake Sailing Club has a sailing area, {{approximately}} 1.9miles (3km) long, for dinghy sailing. The lake {{is divided}} into two areas: a restricted summer area which is available during the <b>fishing</b> <b>season</b> (mid-March to mid-October), and the full area which can be used throughout the winter and on Sunday afternoons. The sailing area is marked out by lines of small white buoys. Racing marks are red buoys with flags, although large inflatable marks are used of open events.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the men of}} Ifaluk atoll, costly {{signalling}} {{theory can}} also explain why men torch fish. Torch fishing is a ritualized method of fishing on Ifaluk whereby men use torches made from dried coconut fronds to catch large dog-toothed tuna. Preparation for torch fishing requires significant time investments and involves {{a great deal of}} organization. Due to the time and energetic costs of preparation, torch fishing results in net caloric losses for fishers. Therefore, torch fishing is a handicap that serves to signal men’s productivity. Torch fishing is the most advertised fishing occupation on Ifaluk. Women and others usually spend time observing the canoes as they sail beyond the reef. Also, local rituals help to broadcast information about which fishers are successful and enhance fishers’ reputations during the torch <b>fishing</b> <b>season.</b> Several ritual behavioural and dietary constraints clearly distinguish torch fishers from other men. First, males are only permitted to torch fish if they participated {{on the first day of}} the <b>fishing</b> <b>season.</b> The community is well informed as to who participates on this day, and can easily identify the torch fishers. Second, torch fishers receive all of their meals at the canoe house and are prohibited from eating certain foods. People frequently discuss the qualities of torch fishermen. On Ifaluk, women claim that they are looking for hard-working mates. With the distinct sexual division of labor on Ifaluk, industriousness is a highly valued characteristic in males. Torch fishing thus provides women with reliable information on the work ethic of prospective mates, which makes it an honest costly signal.|$|E

The flying <b>fish</b> <b>season</b> represents {{the core of the}} life and culture of the Tao tribe; the annual rituals and lifestyles are operated according to the flying <b>fish</b> <b>season.</b> The flying <b>fish</b> <b>season</b> spans from February to August each year, with several important ceremonies taking place during this period, such as mivanwa (flying fish attracting festival) and manoigoyin (end of eating flying fish festival). During the flying <b>fish</b> <b>season,</b> the people are not allowed to catch other than the flying fish and the common dolphinfish; they also have specific regulations for fishing gear and the number of people allowed to fish. During this period, all tribe members must follow traditional norms and avoid violating the related taboos, i.e., must not interfere with the tribe peoples’ lifestyle or affect their personal social status.|$|R

40|$|Research PaperThe {{status of}} {{fisheries}} resources on coastal and offshore areas {{is getting worse}} in Taiwan. Thus, to establish a fishery resources management system has become the main task among stakeholders. In this study, {{we would like to}} examine the feasibility of imposing the community-based co-management system and setting closed <b>fishing</b> <b>seasons</b> on the Northeast coastal fisheries in Taiwan and their potential impacts on fishery sustainability. In practical, lessons from other fishery countries, which have applied community-based fisheries co-management system that can be improved the effectiveness and feasibility for the program, and consequently, the implementation cost can be also reduced. Through questionnaire of Keelung, Nan-Fang-Ao, and Gong-Liao fishermen, the survey results indicate that, in general, their response to closed <b>fishing</b> <b>seasons</b> are important (70. 9 %), only 0. 9 % thank it is not important and 28. 2 % are neutral; Though the majority of them accept the plans of setting closed <b>fishing</b> <b>seasons</b> (67. 77 %), while difference among areas as Keelung (50 %), Nan-Fang-Ao (82. 2 %), Gong-Liao (57. 5 %) respectively. Finally, {{the results of this study}} have indicated: (1) fishermen recognized that a well-designed policy for fisheries management should consult fishermen’s view, while they prefer the government agencies play the role of program as supervisors; (2) fishermen association can help to reach the fishermen’s consensus harmoniously, which is useful to carry out the fisheries co-management system;(3) simulation results show that the application of closed <b>fishing</b> <b>seasons</b> with fisheries co-management system is more effective than that of closed <b>fishing</b> <b>seasons</b> only. These reactions can be referred to the government for establishing future fisheries management policies, which can achieve more economic efficiency and resource sustainability, and also can comply with the international regulations or resolutions...|$|R
25|$|In 2000, WWF placed cod on the {{endangered}} species list. The WWF issued a report stating the global cod catch had suffered a 70% drop over the last 30 years, and if this trend continued, the world’s cod stocks would disappear in 15 years. Åsmund Bjordal, director of the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research disputed the WWF's claim, noting the healthy Barents Sea cod population. Cod (known in Norway as skrei) is among Norway's most important fishery exports and the Barents Sea is Norway's most important cod fishery.

25|$|Historically, in Alaska, {{hand hook}} and line {{trolling}} {{were used to}} catch king and silver salmon in salt water. This method required minimal gear-boat, lines and hooks—and was used to catch fish that were still feeding in open water before returning to spawn. Trolling was very successful in southeast Alaska and historically the catch {{was used by the}} fresh and mild-cured fish packing industries. Power boats located near feeding grounds conducted most of the trolling. Each boat had four to ten lines, extending from tall poles hung outboard when fishing; each line carried several hooks, with heavy lead sinkers and spoons or baits as lures. Trolling lengthened the <b>fishing</b> <b>season,</b> allowing fishermen to fish in early spring before spawning runs.|$|E

25|$|In 2001, {{the annual}} global harvest of edible {{jellyfish}} {{was estimated to}} be around 321,000 metric tons. The most prominent countries involved in edible jellyfish production are Burma, China, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. In China, jellyfish larvae are reared in ponds before being released as juveniles into the sea to grow and mature. In Southeast Asia, edible species of jellyfish may be harvested using various nets such as drift nets, scoop nets, set nets and hand nets, hooks and beach seines. In 2001, the estimated annual catch in Southeast Asia in net weight was at around 169,000 metric tons. The amount of jellyfish caught annually in this region can vary significantly, and the <b>fishing</b> <b>season</b> for them is relatively short, at two to four months.|$|E
