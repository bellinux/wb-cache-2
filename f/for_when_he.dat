5|$|Michael Boulding {{was born}} on 8 February 1976 in Sheffield, England, to Mick and Deirdre Boulding. Boulding has four sisters, Sally, Mary, singer-songwriter Helen, and Laura, who plays rounders for England, and a younger brother, Rory, who is 12 years his junior, and was born after {{the family moved to}} Sheffield. Boulding's family own a {{property}} business, Merlin Estates, which he briefly worked <b>for</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> decided to retire from football in 2005. The firm went into compulsory liquidation in 2009. Boulding lives with his brother, Rory. He also has a helicopter pilot's licence.|$|E
5|$|Aykroyd {{had never}} written a {{screenplay}} before, as he admitted in the 1998 documentary, Stories Behind the Making of The Blues Brothers, or even read one, {{and he was}} unable to find a writing partner. Consequently, he put together a very descriptive volume that explained the characters' origins and how the band members were recruited. His final draft was 324 pages, which was three times longer than a standard screenplay, written not in a standard screenplay format, but more like free verse. To soften the impact, Aykroyd made a joke of the thick script and had it bound with the cover of the Los Angeles Yellow Pages directory <b>for</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> turned it in to producer Robert K. Weiss. Landis was given the task of editing the script into a usable screenplay, which took him about two weeks.|$|E

25|$|The agent's {{company has}} been {{planning}} for years to turn the last survivor of the Creedish cult into a religious celebrity. They create a fake history for Tender and completely overhaul his body. He is given steroid injections, health food, teeth caps, and is made to exercise and diet incessantly until he is the model of attractiveness. It is made clear by the agent {{that no one will}} worship an ugly religious leader. Tender is entirely agreeable to all of it, as he has no will to live and desires fame only in order to have an enormous audience <b>for</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> commits suicide.|$|E
25|$|Despite violent rivalries and the {{fracturing}} of the kingdom, {{it continued}} to exist independently well into the 19th century. The rise of the clans became noticeable in the 1850s {{at the end of}} the reign of Henrique II. In 1855 or 1856, two potential kings emerged to contest the succession following his death. Álvaro Ndongo claimed the throne on behalf of the Kinlaza faction of Matari (ignoring the existence of Andre's group at Mbanza Puto), calling himself Álvaro XIII and Pedro Lelo claimed the throne on behalf of the Mbidizi Valley faction of the Kinlaza from a base at Bembe. Pedro won the contest, thanks to soliciting Portuguese aid, and with their help his soldiers defeated Álvaro. Like André II, Álvaro XIII did not accept defeat and established his own base at Nkunga, not far from São Salvador. The Portuguese support which had put Pedro V on the throne had a price, <b>for</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was crowned Pedro V (he was actually the second king named Pedro V; the first one ruled in the late 1770s) in 1857 he also swore a treaty of vassalage to Portugal. Portugal gained nominal authority over Kongo, and even constructed a fort in São Salvador to house a garrison.|$|E

25|$|During the Forever Evil storyline, Scarecrow {{learns that}} Bane {{may be the}} cause of the Blackgate {{uprising}} and will be their leader in the impending war, and that Talons were stored at Blackgate on ice. Bane, having escaped Peña Dura Prison in Santa Prisca, ships his Venom to Gotham City to be there <b>for</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> arrives. As he is traveling to Gotham, he orchestrates the release of Blackgate's prisoners during the Crime Syndicate's broadcast to the world. Later, on board his ship, he prepares his men for the impending war with Scarecrow, and with Gotham in the distant, claims it will be his. Bane enters Blackgate through the sewers to join the prisoners there. While there, he comes across where the Talons are stored hoping to make them in to his weapons. While the attack on Gotham City begins between Bane's men and the GCPD, Bane also approaches Professor Pyg, forcing him to join his cause, and spread word that everything in Gotham is now controlled by Bane. Bane arrives at Blackgate as Man-Bat and his fellow bats are attempting to transport the Talons to Mr. Freeze and is able to keep one from leaving. Bane retrieves Emperor Penguin for the Penguin as part of their agreement.|$|E
25|$|After {{witnessing}} {{the death of}} Conquering Bear at the Grattan massacre, Crazy Horse began to get trance visions. Curly went out on a vision quest to seek guidance but without going through the traditional procedures first. In his vision, a warrior on his horse rode out of a lake and the horse seemed to float and dance throughout the vision. He wore simple clothing, no face paint, his hair down with just a feather in it, and a small brown stone behind his ear. Bullets and arrows flew around him as he charged forward, but {{neither he nor his}} horse were hit. A thunderstorm came over the warrior, and his people grabbed hold of his arms trying to hold him back. The warrior broke their hold and then lightning struck him, leaving a lightning symbol on his cheek, and white marks like hailstones appeared on his body. The warrior told Curly that as long he dressed modestly, his tribesmen did not touch him, and he did not take any scalps or war trophies, then he would not be harmed in battle. As the vision ended, he heard a red-tailed hawk shrieking off in the distance. Curly’s father later interpreted the vision and said that the warrior was going to be him. The lightning bolt on his cheek and the hailstones on his body were to become his war paint. Curly was to follow the warrior’s role to dress modestly and to do as the warrior's prophecy said so he would be unharmed in battle. For the most part, the vision was true and Crazy Horse was rarely harmed in battle, except <b>for</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was struck by an arrow after taking two enemy scalps. He was shot in the face by No Water when Little Big Man tried to hold Crazy Horse back to prevent a fight from breaking out, and he was held back by one of his tribesmen—according to some reports, Little Big Man himself—when he was stabbed by a bayonet the night he died.|$|E

500|$|Tatiana {{was also}} fond of an officer named Vladimir Kiknadze, whom she cared <b>for</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> {{was wounded in}} 1915 and again in 1916, {{according}} to the diary of Valentina Ivanovna Chebotareva, a nurse who worked with Tatiana during the war. Chebotareva described how Tatiana sometimes sat beside [...] "Volodia" [...] at the piano as he played a tune with one finger and talked {{to her in a}} low voice, wearing a mysterious expression on his face. Chebotareva also described how Tatiana and her sister Olga made excuses to come to the hospital to see Volodia. Chebotareva felt the flirtations between the grand duchesses and the wounded officers could cause gossip and damage the girls' reputations.|$|E
500|$|The Chronology of Yue Wumu {{lists the}} events at Zhou's tomb {{happening}} in 1121 when Yue was nineteen, but Yue {{would have been}} eighteen in that year since he was born on [...] "the fifteenth day of the second month of 1103". The author of the original source material was using xusui age calculation, in which a child is already considered one year old at birth. Since Yue joined the military shortly after Zhou's death, a relative time frame can be given <b>for</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> died. During {{the early months of}} 1122, the Song empire mobilized its armed forces to assist the Jurchen in confronting their common enemy, the Liao Dynasty. Therefore, it appears that Zhou died in late 1121, before the call to arms was issued.|$|E
500|$|I am {{ashamed to}} relate what Gallienus used often {{to say at}} this time, when such things were happening, as though jesting amid the ills of mankind. <b>For</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was told of the revolt of Egypt, {{he is said to}} have exclaimed [...] "What! We cannot do without Egyptian linen!" [...] and when {{informed}} that Asia had been devastated both by the violence of nature and by the inroads of the Scythians, he said, [...] "What! We cannot do without saltpetre!" [...] and when Gaul was lost, he is reported to have laughed and remarked, [...] "Can the commonwealth be safe without Atrebatic cloaks?" [...] Thus, in short, with regard to all parts of the world, as he lost them, he would jest, as though seeming to have suffered the loss of some article of trifling service.|$|E

500|$|The {{different}} vendors all collaborated for {{the final}} battle sequence, which {{takes place in the}} wreckage of a helicarrier: Luma created the climactic fight between Deadpool and Ajax; DD created the majority of the Colossus effects, except <b>for</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> is damaged later on, which was handled by Blur Studio; DD also created the effects for Negasonic Teenage Warhead's abilities as well as expanding the helicarrier's deck; Rodeo contributed matte paintings for the background; and Weta provided the facial animation for Deadpool. Negasonic's abilities were the only [...] "supernatural effect-sy thing" [...] in the film, and were based on fuel-air exposives and solar flares to try ground them in reality. Setting the final sequence on the wrecked helicarrier was Miller's idea, to help expand the scope of the third act and include more connections to the comics and wider Marvel Universe. To avoid rights issues with Marvel Studios, the helicarrier for Deadpool was designed to be [...] "as different as possible from the one in The Avengers." [...] Additionally, a French animation artist with a [...] "unique style" [...] created 2D cartoon characters that dance around Deadpool after he is stabbed in the head during the fight.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Judy Coleman of The Boston Globe called [...] "Get Back" [...] a [...] "welcome girl-rock hit". Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic included the song at number eight on his [...] "Top 10 from the Disney girls" [...] list, and said, [...] "She wrote {{this with the}} Jonas Brothers, but it sounds more like a Tommy Tutone B-side from the early '80s or {{the sort of thing}} Greg Kihn was pining <b>for</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> sang, 'They don't write 'em like that anymore'". Masley noted that the song sounds better live, as does [...] "nearly everything Lovato touches". Masley concluded, writing, [...] "When she sings 'I {{want to get back to}} the old days,' what she means is when she and her boyfriend were happy, but power-pop fans will hear it as a call to get back to much older days than that." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted it as one of the best tracks on Don't Forget. Joey Guerra of The Houston Chronicle called it [...] "undeniably kicky, and Lovato manages some surprisingly credible rock wails." [...] Ken Barnes of USA Today called it an [...] "insidious, Go-Go's-like single".|$|E
500|$|Keogh {{was born}} in Birmingham, England, and moved to New Zealand when he was young. In 1884 he started playing senior club rugby for Kaikorai Rugby Football Club in Dunedin. Keogh played as half-back, and had already gained a {{reputation}} as a talented player before being selected to play provincially for Otago in 1887. For Otago, Keogh played one match against the privately organised British team that toured New Zealand and Australia in 1888. Early {{in the second half of}} the match, with no score from either team, the ball was heeled loose from an Otago scrum and Keogh collected the ball before darting through the British Isles' forwards to score a try. The tourists recovered to score twice after an Otago player left the field injured (there were no injury replacements). The British Isles eventually won 4–3, but Keogh's play against the tourists was described as [...] "outstanding". It was rumoured that Keogh, who had missed Otago's first match against the British due to injury, had watched through a hole in a fence in order to devise strategies <b>for</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> could play them.|$|E
