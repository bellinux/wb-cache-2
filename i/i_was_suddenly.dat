500|$|Little {{is known}} of this period of Alkan's life, other than that apart from {{composing}} he was immersed {{in the study of}} the Bible and the Talmud. Throughout this period Alkan continued his correspondence with Ferdinand Hiller, whom he had probably met in Paris in the 1830s, and with Masarnau, from which some insights can be gained. It appears that Alkan completed a full translation into French, now lost, of both the Old Testament and the New Testament, from their original languages. In 1865, he wrote to Hiller: [...] "Having translated a good deal of the Apocrypha, I'm now onto the second Gospel which I am translating from the Syriac... In starting to translate the New Testament, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> struck by a singular idea– that you have to be Jewish to be able to do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|While I {{was hearing}} the boys’ confessions {{on the evening}} of the 5th [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> terrorized by the sight of a {{celestial}} person who presented himself to my mind’s eye. He had in his hand a sort of weapon like a very long sharp-pointed steel blade which seemed to emit fire. At the very instant that I saw all this, I saw that person hurl the weapon into my soul with all his might. I cried out with difficulty and felt I was dying. I asked the boy to leave because I felt ill and no longer had the strength to continue. This agony lasted uninterruptedly until the morning of the 7th. I cannot tell you how much I suffered during this period of anguish. Even my entrails were torn and ruptured by the weapon, and nothing was spared. From that day on I have been mortally wounded. I feel in the depths of my soul a wound that is always open and which causes me continual agony.|$|E

I came to you, Mr. Holmes, because I recognized that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> myself an unpractical man and because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>suddenly</b> confronted with a most serious and extraordinary problem.

"Unconscious of {{anything}} but the exciting chase before me, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>suddenly</b> disagreeably reminded {{that there is such}} a thing as caution, and necessity to look where you are going to, for, putting his foot in an unusually deep tuca-tuca hole, my little horse comes with a crash upon his head, and turns completely over on his back, burying me beneath him in a hopeless muddle."

6000|$|... "You set me philosophizing. I'd never {{examined}} a girls' school before, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> {{struck by the}} spectacle of the fifty of you. What's going to become of them all?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nillie!" [...] exclaimed Mr. Malcolm MacPherson. There {{was such}} real agony {{in his tone}} that Peggy and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>suddenly</b> {{stricken}} with contrition. What were we doing? We {{had no right to}} be listening to this pitiful interview. The pain and protest in his voice had suddenly banished all the humour from it, and left naught but the bare, stark tragedy. We rose and tiptoed out of the room, wholesomely ashamed of ourselves.|$|R
6000|$|I felt {{weak and}} cold as if <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> <b>suddenly</b> poisoned. <b>I</b> trembled, then grew hot with indignation. [...] "Sixty cents apiece!" [...] I gasped. [...] "Didn't I warn you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I seem to {{have had}} no time for games. I like walking, walking in the country or even walking in the cities and {{watching}} the people. Only the London streets are so sad. Then <b>I</b> <b>am</b> fond of reading. I'm afraid <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> rather a strange figure if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> to <b>be</b> <b>suddenly</b> projected into your world, Lady Elisabeth." ...|$|R
60|$|I had {{got as far}} as that in rehearsing my {{explanatory}} phrases, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> {{checked by}} seeing plainly in Mr. Candy's face that my experiment on him was a total failure.|$|E
60|$|At {{the end of}} {{that time}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> {{conscious}} that she had laid down her book, and was regarding me through partially-closed eyes. I too laid down my paper. Our eyes met, and she smiled.|$|E
6000|$|He {{recovered}} {{himself with}} a little effort. [...] "It is all right," [...] he said. [...] "You know I told you I'd come down here to recoup a little. I get nervous attacks. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> giddy then." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nonsense, child, about introducing; {{you know}} better than that. A {{practical}} professional man, tired and hungry, who has been travelling ever since daylight this morning, will hardly be inclined to talk and air courtesies to-night. He wants food and shelter, and you must see that he has it, simply because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>suddenly</b> laid up and cannot. There is nothing so dreadful in that, I hope? You get all kinds of stuff into your head from reading so many of those novels.' ...|$|R
6000|$|A {{night or}} two later <b>I</b> <b>was</b> again <b>suddenly</b> awakened to feel that Oro was approaching. He {{appeared}} like a ghost in the bright moonlight, greeted me, and said: ...|$|R
60|$|She {{started to}} walk to where <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> and <b>suddenly</b> <b>I</b> seen she <b>was</b> limping. So <b>I</b> gave her a hand down to my room, and set her on a chair.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{off for a}} stroll. There {{are many}} things in this town I haven't seen as yet, {{and it would be}} a pity if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> called to Cambridge without having learned all that may be come at." ...|$|E
6000|$|Before noon {{the next}} day she brought in the speech, neatly typewritten, and laid it on my desk. Looking up and {{catching}} her eye just as she was about to withdraw, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> impelled to ask:--"Well, {{what did you think of}} it?" ...|$|E
60|$|How long I slept I do not know; but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> {{aroused by}} a sharp tug at my sleeve. The room was in darkness, but a hot smell of oil {{told me that}} the lamp had only that instant been extinguished.|$|E
60|$|Just a line {{or two to}} say <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>suddenly</b> called away to bury my sick mother. When that is off my mind I'll {{write you}} what I know about the Hegira, the Flight into Egypt, the Retreat of the Ten Thousand, and {{whatever}} else {{you would like to}} learn. There is nothing mean about me! I don't think there has been any wilful desertion. You may engage an editor for, say, fifty years, with the privilege of keeping him regularly, if, {{at the end of that}} time, I should break my neck hastening back.|$|R
40|$|A grand {{seduction}} indeed Was it {{over another}} bottomless glass of sangria {{or during the}} boat ride on a sparkling lake? I’m not sure exactly when it occurred to me, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>suddenly</b> very popular. People laugh more at my jokes, request that <b>I</b> <b>be</b> seated first, and listen to even the longest of my stories. And while I {{would like to believe}} that my Semitic features or past travels have invoked such interest, the truth is this: my name <b>is</b> Eric, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a graduating fam-ily physician. From Vancouver to Val-d’Or, Canadians are in dire need of family doc-tors. Recent estimates peg the shortage at 3000, and between 4 and 5 millio...|$|R
60|$|But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> gone but {{a little}} way when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> brought <b>suddenly</b> to a {{standstill}} by another sound that in the hush of the garden, in the bright languor after sleep, went to my heart: {{it was as if}} a child were crying.|$|R
60|$|I cannot {{undertake}} to {{say what}} happened. I {{was not in a}} fit state to witness or to chronicle such events. I can only say that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> conscious that his face was away from me--that he was looking towards the animal.|$|E
60|$|DEAR PAMELA,--An {{hour after}} you left <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> struck with a realizing sense of the utter chuckle-headedness of that notion of mine: to send your trunk after you. Land! it was idiotic. None but a lunatic would, {{separate}} himself from his baggage.|$|E
60|$|What wonder, then, {{my senses}} {{fell asleep in}} that vast lullaby! And out of a {{daydream}} almost as deep as that in which I first set out, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> aroused by a light tapping sound, distinct and regular between the roaring breakers.|$|E
6000|$|Absorbed in {{the delicious}} reverie which {{was caused by}} the dear creature's confusion, we were both silent for a while, and should have {{remained}} so for hours perhaps, so lost were we in happiness, had <b>I</b> not <b>been</b> <b>suddenly</b> roused by a voice exclaiming from behind us-- ...|$|R
60|$|A side eye at my Hamlet hat. If <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>suddenly</b> naked here as <b>I</b> sit? <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not. Across {{the sands}} of all the world, {{followed}} by the sun's flaming sword, to the west, trekking to evening lands. She trudges, schlepps, trains, drags, trascines her load. A tide westering, moondrawn, in her wake. Tides, myriadislanded, within her, blood not mine, oinopa ponton, a winedark sea. Behold the handmaid of the moon. In sleep the wet sign calls her hour, bids her rise. Bridebed, childbed, bed of death, ghostcandled. Omnis caro ad te veniet. He comes, pale vampire, through storm his eyes, his bat sails bloodying the sea, mouth to her mouth's kiss.|$|R
6000|$|His {{interruption}} {{serves to}} turn me back from my momentary contemplation of those popular effigies inflated by old newspapers and windy report, the earthly great. He sets me thinking of more personal and intimate applications, {{of the human}} beings one knows with a certain approximation to real knowledge, of the actual common substance of life. He turns me to the thought of rivalries and tendernesses, of differences and disappointments. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>suddenly</b> brought painfully against the things that might have been. What if instead of that Utopia of vacant ovals we meet relinquished loves here, and opportunities lost and faces as they might have looked to us? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Right!" [...] He {{seemed to}} be a person of few words. Following him down the passage <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> {{interrupted}} by a small woman, who stepped out from what proved to be the dining-room door. She was a bright, vivacious, dark-eyed lady, more French than English in her type.|$|E
60|$|How long I lay in this {{condition}} I know not, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> awakened by a yell so appalling that my heart leaped as if into my throat, and my nerves thrilled with horror. For one instant I was paralysed; then my blood seemed to rebound on its course. I sprang up and attempted to seize my rifle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Time," [...] replied Syme, [...] "for one {{outrageous}} thought. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>suddenly</b> possessed {{with the}} idea that the blind, blank back of his head really was his face--an awful, eyeless face staring at me! And I fancied that the figure running in front of me was really a figure running backwards, and dancing as he ran." ...|$|E
5000|$|Track #4, [...] "Ya Svoboden" [...] (<b>I</b> <b>am</b> Free), <b>suddenly</b> {{became a}} hit in 2003 when it was re-released by Kipelov and a music video was aired on MTV. The ballad topped Russian rock charts and was {{featured}} on MTV Russia's Top 20.|$|R
5000|$|Saurau on his {{decaying}} family [...] "My sisters {{but also}} my daughters {{always try to}} keep me going by fraudulent means, deceptions major and minor, but especially through one scandalous ruse: their attention.

If I lose interest and have myself {{laid out in the}} summer cottage. Plan to have myself laid out in the summer cottage like my father. A dead father," [...] he said, [...] "really instils fear.

6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] she says, [...] "I want to {{hear from}} you, but I {{do not want to see}} you. There's a sort of {{abstract}} YOU that I want to go on with. Something I've made out of you.... I want to know things about you--but I don't want to see or feel or imagine. When some day I have got rid of my intolerable sense of proprietorship, it may be different. Then perhaps we may meet again. <b>I</b> think it <b>is</b> even more the loss of our political work and dreams that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> feeling than the loss of your presence. Aching loss.
