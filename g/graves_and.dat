5|$|The Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) is an {{intergovernmental}} organisation of six independent member states whose principal {{function is to}} mark, record and maintain the <b>graves</b> <b>and</b> places of commemoration of Commonwealth of Nations military service members {{who died in the}} two World Wars. The Commission is also responsible for commemorating Commonwealth civilians who {{died as a result of}} enemy action during World War II. The Commission was founded by Fabian Ware and constituted through Royal Charter in 1917 named the Imperial War Graves Commission. The change to the present name took place in 1960.|$|E

5|$|The {{controversy}} in Austria only ceased when Empress Maria Theresa of Austria sent her personal physician, Gerard van Swieten, {{to investigate the}} claims of vampiric entities.

Other European countries followed suit. Despite this condemnation, the vampire lived on in artistic works and in local superstition.|$|E

5|$|The first {{victims were}} a few {{thousand}} men arrested in July 1941 and brought from Riga Central Prison. In 1942 another 12,000 Jews were brought from Germany, Austria, and Czechoslovakia. In 1943 Riga Ghetto prisoners were brought here who were unable to work at Kaiserwald concentration camp, followed by those from the camp itself unable to work in 1944. In 1943 and onwards Nazis dug up <b>graves</b> <b>and</b> burned the bodies to hide the evidence. It is estimated {{that there are now}} around 20,000 victims buried in the forest.|$|E

5|$|The stone church's three-stage tower has six bells, {{three of}} which {{were made by the}} local Bilbie family, to whom a {{redundant}} bell {{at the back of the}} church serves as a memorial. The interior of the church is largely Victorian and includes 156 angels in wood and stone. The churchyard includes <b>graves</b> <b>and</b> memorials to local residents and the base of a 14th-century cross. The remains of the cross from Morteon were moved to Chew Stoke when their original site was flooded during the construction of Chew Valley Lake in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Tiberius {{has been}} {{represented}} in fiction, in literature, film and television, and in video games, {{often as a}} peripheral character in the central storyline. One such modern representation is in the novel I, Claudius by Robert <b>Graves,</b> <b>and</b> the consequent BBC television series adaptation, where he is portrayed by George Baker. George R. R. Martin, the author of The Song of Ice and Fire series, has stated that central character Stannis Baratheon is partially inspired by Tiberius Caesar, and particularly the portrayal by Baker.|$|E
5|$|As of {{that time}} and in the {{following}} decades, Western Pomerania, plus some of Greater Poland, Lower Silesia and some areas west of the middle and lower Oder River made up the Sukow-Dziedzice culture group. Its origin {{is the subject of}} debate among archeologists. First settlements appear in the early 6th century and cannot be directly derived from any other Slavic archeological culture. They reveal certain similarities to the artifacts of the Dobrodzień group of the Przeworsk culture. According to scholars such as Siedow, Kurnatowska and Brzostowicz, it might be a direct continuation of the Przeworsk tradition. According to allochthonists, it represents a variant of the Prague culture and is considered its younger stage. The Sukow-Dziedzice group shows significant idiosyncrasies, such as no <b>graves</b> <b>and</b> (typical {{for the rest of the}} Slavic world) rectangular dwellings set partially below the ground level were found within its span.|$|E
