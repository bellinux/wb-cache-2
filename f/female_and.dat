40|$|This {{study is}} a sociolinguistic study about request made by male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> {{employer}} to the male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees <b>and</b> also male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees to male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers. The writer is interested in investigating request since request can be used differently by both employers and employees. She also wants to know the types of request used by the male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employer to the male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees <b>and</b> male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees to male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers. The writer used Ervin-Tripp?s theory of request as the main theory to classify the types of request. To find {{the most frequently used}} types of request used by both male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers <b>and</b> both male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees, the writer used descriptive quantitative approach. The writer found that both male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers mostly used the same types of request expressions to both male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees. However, the writer found various types of request used by both male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees to both male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers. The result of this research showed that both male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers mostly used bald imperatives as their types of request, both to their male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees. However, both male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees used various types of request, both to male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employer. Thus, the result might prove that the social status and gender may have influenced the types of request made by both male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employers <b>and</b> both male <b>and</b> <b>female</b> employees...|$|R
