40|$|From 1950 to 1960, the United States Air Force Band in Washington, DC {{participated in}} one of the most {{aggressive}} and widespread diplomatic campaigns in United States History. They completed ten international tours through Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and South America as part of the U. S. State Department's cultural diplomacy program. Conceived as a way to thwart the spread of Soviet Communism in vulnerable countries worldwide, cultural diplomacy's purpose was to promote democracy and American ideas of freedom and individuality as a way to gain global influence and contain Soviet infiltration. In researching this project, I discovered that the USAF Band exemplified U. S. cultural ambassadorship. Their performances were met <b>with</b> large and <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>audiences.</b> Through their musical mission, the band cultivated some extraordinary relationships within some very tenuous environments, strengthening US goodwill efforts abroad and perpetuating democratic ideals. &# 8195...|$|R

60|$|She {{recalled}} {{him as he}} {{had been}} in his first youth--reserved, sensible, thoughtful, but with the fire of ambition burning strongly within, and ever and anon flashing forth vividly, repressed at once as too demonstrative, but <b>filling</b> her <b>with</b> <b>enthusiastic</b> admiration. She remembered him calmly and manfully meeting the shock of the failure, that would, he knew, fetter and encumber him through life--how resolutely he had faced the difficulties, how unselfishly he had put himself out of the question, how uprightly he had dealt by the creditors, how considerately by his father and aunt, how wise and moderate his proceedings had been throughout. She recollected how she had shared his aspirations, and gloried in his consistent and prudent course, without perceiving what sorrow had since taught her-that ambition was to him what pleasure was to other young men. What had it not been to her when that ambition began to be gratified! when he had become a leading man in Parliament, and by-and-by held office.|$|R
50|$|When Kaye Gibbons {{published}} Ellen Foster in 1987, the novel—her first—met <b>with</b> an <b>enthusiastic</b> <b>audience.</b> Critics admired Gibbons's skillful {{creation of}} Ellen's narrative voice, acknowledging its accuracy in representing a child's point of view. Gibbons won two literary awards for Ellen Foster, the Sue Kaufman Prize for First Fiction and a citation from the Ernest Hemingway Foundation. While some readers criticized {{the events of}} the novel as being melodramatic, others asserted that Ellen's wisdom, resilience, and tenacity save her narrative from becoming a sentimental tearjerker. Gibbons has said that some of {{the events of the}} novel—Ellen's mother's suicide and Ellen's subsequent movement from one relative's home to another—reflect her own childhood experiences. Ellen is indeed a lonely child, quietly observing the happiness of other families, yearning to belong, and making mental notes about what her perfect family should be like. Ellen Foster is ultimately a coming-of-age story, as Ellen engineers for herself a place in the secure, nurturing family she has craved and simultaneously comes to understand herself better through her friendship with Starletta, her black friend. Against the Southern backdrop of racism, Ellen moves from feeling she is superior to Starletta into a new understanding that color {{has nothing to do with}} a person's character. Ellen Foster belongs not only to the Southern tradition in American literature, with its distinctive voice and its treatment of racism, but also to that of first-person coming-of-age narratives, in which the narrator's innocence is also his or her wisdom.|$|R

The thread on our forums are <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>enthusiastic</b> and overwhelmingly positive impressions of the game, and Lasharor has some excellent tips for newcomers."

When you get up a real head of steam and fly though the caves (after banking some rope and hook upgrades, of course), Hook Champ borders on zen. You just know when to throw the hook again and keep out of the gaping maw that’s giving chase. Developer Rocketcat keeps adding new content through updates, such as additional levels, so Hook Champ has real longevity."

It has expressive, retro graphics, well-written dialogue full of humor, and an addictive gameplay mechanic." [...] 148apps gave it 4/5 stars, concluding [...] "This game is exactly what I love about the iPhone. A small time developer has a great simple idea, executes it extremely well and can put it out for me to consume and enjoy. I can’t recommend this retro style platformer enough, especially at the price of $2.99. It’s the first game I’ve reviewed here that I think is a must buy. It’s too bad this game isn’t in the top 100 of games sold on the appstore, because it definitely should be. The game currently has a 4.5 star rating average on the appstore, and it’s definitely well deserved." [...] AppSafari said [...] AppSafari gave it 4.5/5 stars, commenting [...] "For only $0.99 Hook Champs is a great value. Counterintuitivly, I found the retro-style graphics to be a breath of fresh air. If you are playing on an iPad, iPhone 3G (or later model), or a third generation iPod Touch, loading times should be virtually non-existent. Older iOS devices may experience a bit of lag." ...|$|R
60|$|Below him lay a {{succession}} of valleys opening into each other like gentle lakes, until they were lost to the southward. Westerly the distant range hid the bosky canada which sheltered the Mission of San Pablo. In the farther distance the Pacific Ocean stretched away, bearing a cloud of fog upon its bosom, which crept through {{the entrance of the}} bay, and rolled thickly between him and the northeastward; the same fog hid the base of the mountain and the view beyond. Still from time to time the fleecy veil parted, and timidly disclosed charming glimpses of mighty rivers, mountain defiles, and rolling plains, sear with ripened oats and bathed in the glow of the setting sun. As father Jose gazed, he was penetrated with a pious longing. Already his imagination, <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>enthusiastic</b> conceptions, beheld all that vast expanse gathered under the mild sway of the holy faith and peopled with zealous converts. Each little knoll in fancy became crowned with a chapel; from each dark canon gleamed the white walls of a mission building. Growing bolder in his enthusiasm and looking farther into futurity, he beheld a new Spain rising on these savage shores. He already saw the spires of stately cathedrals, the domes of palaces, vineyards, gardens, and groves. Convents, half hid among the hills, peeping from plantations of branching limes, and long processions of chanting nuns wound through the denies. So completely was the good Father's conception of the future confounded with the past, that even in their choral strain the well-remembered accents of Carmen struck his ear. He was busied in these fanciful imaginings, when suddenly over that extended prospect the faint distant tolling of a bell rang sadly out and died. It was the Angelus. Father Jose listened with superstitious exaltation. The Mission of San Pablo was far away, and the sound must have been some miraculous omen. But never before, to his enthusiastic sense, did the sweet seriousness of this angelic symbol come with such strange significance. With the last faint peal his glowing fancy seemed to cool; the fog closed in below him, and the good Father remembered he had not had his supper. He had risen and was wrapping his serapa around him, when he perceived {{for the first time that}} he was not alone.|$|R
