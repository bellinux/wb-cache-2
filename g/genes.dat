5|$|Essential <b>genes</b> are {{the set of}} <b>genes</b> {{thought to}} be {{critical}} for an organism's survival. This definition assumes the abundant availability of all relevant nutrients {{and the absence of}} environmental stress. Only a small portion of an organism's <b>genes</b> are essential. In bacteria, an estimated 250–400 <b>genes</b> are essential for Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, which is less than 10% of their <b>genes.</b> Half of these <b>genes</b> are orthologs in both organisms and are largely involved in protein synthesis. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the number of essential <b>genes</b> is slightly higher, at 1000 <b>genes</b> (~20% of their <b>genes).</b> Although the number is more difficult to measure in higher eukaryotes, mice and humans are estimated to have around 2000 essential <b>genes</b> (~10% of their <b>genes).</b> The synthetic organism, Syn 3, has a minimal genome of 473 essential <b>genes</b> and quasi-essential <b>genes</b> (necessary for fast growth), although 149 have unknown function.|$|E
5|$|<b>Genes</b> with a {{most recent}} common ancestor, {{and thus a}} shared {{evolutionary}} ancestry, are known as homologs. These <b>genes</b> appear either from gene duplication within an organism's genome, where they are known as paralogous <b>genes,</b> or {{are the result of}} divergence of the <b>genes</b> after a speciation event, where they are known as orthologous <b>genes,</b> and often perform the same or similar functions in related organisms. It is often assumed that the functions of orthologous <b>genes</b> are more similar than those of paralogous <b>genes,</b> although the difference is minimal.|$|E
5|$|A small {{fraction}} of the <b>genes</b> in an organism's genome control the organism's development. These <b>genes</b> are called the developmental-genetic toolkit. They are highly conserved among phyla, meaning that they are ancient and very similar in widely separated groups of animals. Differences in deployment of toolkit <b>genes</b> affect the body plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts. Most toolkit <b>genes</b> are parts of signalling pathways: they encode transcription factors, cell adhesion proteins, cell surface receptor proteins and signalling ligands that bind to them, and secreted morphogens that diffuse through the embryo. All of these help to define the fate of undifferentiated cells in the embryo. Together, they generate the patterns in time and space which shape the embryo, and ultimately form the body plan of the organism. Among the most important toolkit <b>genes</b> are the Hox <b>genes.</b> These transcription factors contain the homeobox protein-binding DNA motif, also found in other toolkit <b>genes,</b> and create the basic pattern of the body along its front-to-back axis.|$|E

Some 250 of these <b>genes</b> are more specifically expressed in the thyroid with about 20 <b>genes</b> being highly thyroid specific. The corresponding specific proteins are mainly involved in thyroid hormone synthesis, such as thyroglobulin, TPO and IYD, and expressed in follicular cells.

5|$|About 20,000 protein-coding <b>genes</b> are {{expressed}} in human cells and nearly 70% of these <b>genes</b> {{are expressed}} in the normal esophagus. Some 250 of these <b>genes</b> are more specifically expressed in the esophagus with less than 50 <b>genes</b> being highly specific. The corresponding esophagus-specific proteins are mainly involved in squamous differentiation such as keratins KRT13, KRT4 and KRT6C. Other specific proteins that help lubricate the inner surface of esophagus are mucins such as MUC21 and MUC22.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Gene</b> {{expression}} profiling is {{a promising}} approach to better estimate patient prognosis; however, {{there are still}} unresolved problems, including little overlap among similarly developed <b>gene</b> sets and poor performance of a developed <b>gene</b> set in other datasets. Results We applied a <b>gene</b> sets approach to develop a prognostic <b>gene</b> set from multiple <b>gene</b> expression datasets. By analyzing 12 independent breast cancer <b>gene</b> expression datasets comprising 1, 756 tissues with 2, 411 pre-defined <b>gene</b> sets including <b>gene</b> ontology categories and pathways, we found many <b>gene</b> sets that were prognostic {{in most of the}} analyzed datasets. Those prognostic <b>gene</b> sets were related to biological processes such as cell cycle and proliferation and had additional prognostic values over conventional clinical parameters such as tumor grade, lymph node status, estrogen receptor (ER) status, and tumor size. We then estimated the prediction accuracy of each <b>gene</b> set by performing external validation using six large datasets and identified a <b>gene</b> set with an average prediction accuracy of 67. 55 %. Conclusion A <b>gene</b> sets approach is an effective method to develop prognostic <b>gene</b> sets to predict patient outcome and to understand the underlying biology of the developed <b>gene</b> set.

50|$|Therapeutic <b>gene</b> {{modulation}} {{refers to}} the practice of altering the expression of a <b>gene</b> at one of various stages, with a view to alleviate some form of ailment. It differs from <b>gene</b> therapy in that <b>gene</b> modulation seeks to alter the expression of an endogenous <b>gene</b> (perhaps through the introduction of a <b>gene</b> encoding a novel modulatory protein) whereas <b>gene</b> therapy concerns the introduction of a <b>gene</b> whose product aids the recipient directly.|$|R

Genome-wide association scans have identified other <b>genes</b> that are altered to characteristic variants in psoriasis.

40|$|Abstract. Identifying <b>gene</b> {{function}} {{has many}} useful applications especially in <b>Gene</b> Therapy. Identifying <b>gene</b> function based on <b>gene</b> expression data {{is much easier}} in prokaryotes than eukaryotes due to the relatively simple structure of prokaryotes. That is why tissue-specific expression is the primary tool for identifying <b>gene</b> function in eukaryotes. However, {{recent studies have shown}} that there is a strong learnable correlation between <b>gene</b> function and <b>gene</b> expression. This paper outlines a new approach for <b>gene</b> function prediction in mouse. The prediction mechanism depends on using Artificial Neural Networks (NN) to predict <b>gene</b> function based on quantitative analysis of <b>gene</b> co-expression. Our results show that (NN) can be extremely useful in this area. Also, we explore clustering of <b>gene</b> functions as a preprocessing step for predicting <b>gene</b> function. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background A <b>gene</b> {{regulatory}} relation often {{changes over}} time rather than being constant. But many <b>gene</b> regulatory networks available in databases or literatures are static {{in the sense that}} they are either snapshots of <b>gene</b> regulatory relations at a time point or union of successive <b>gene</b> regulations over time. Such static networks cannot represent temporal aspects of <b>gene</b> regulatory interactions such as the order of <b>gene</b> regulations or the pace of <b>gene</b> regulations. Results We developed a new qualitative method for representing dynamic <b>gene</b> regulatory relations and algorithms for identifying dynamic <b>gene</b> regulations from the time-series <b>gene</b> expression data using two types of scores. The identified <b>gene</b> regulatory interactions and their temporal properties are visualized as a <b>gene</b> regulatory network. All the algorithms have been implemented in a program called GeneNetFinder ([URL]) and tested on several <b>gene</b> expression data. Conclusions The dynamic nature of dynamic <b>gene</b> regulatory interactions can be inferred and represented qualitatively without deriving a set of differential equations describing the interactions. The approach and the program developed in our study would be useful for identifying dynamic <b>gene</b> regulatory interactions from the large amount of <b>gene</b> expression data available and for analyzing the interactions. </p...|$|R

5|$|Genetics is {{believed}} {{to be involved in the}} majority of cases, either directly or indirectly. Some epilepsies are due to a single gene defect (1–2%); most are due to the interaction of multiple <b>genes</b> and environmental factors. Each of the single gene defects is rare, with more than 200 in all described. Most <b>genes</b> involved affect ion channels, either directly or indirectly. These include <b>genes</b> for ion channels themselves, enzymes, GABA, and G protein-coupled receptors.|$|E
5|$|Homologous {{sequences}} are paralogous if {{they were}} created by a duplication event within the genome. For gene duplication events, if a gene in an organism is duplicated to occupy two different positions in the same genome, then the two copies are paralogous. Paralogous <b>genes</b> often {{belong to the same}} species. They can shape the structure of whole genomes and thus explain genome evolution to a large extent. Examples include the Homeobox (Hox) <b>genes</b> in animals. These <b>genes</b> not only underwent gene duplications within chromosomes but also whole genome duplications. As a result, Hox <b>genes</b> in most vertebrates are clustered across multiple chromosomes with the HoxA-D clusters being the best studied.|$|E

5|$|Labrador {{colouration}} {{is controlled}} by multiple <b>genes.</b> It is possible for recessive <b>genes</b> to re-emerge in later generations. Also, there can sometimes be unexpected pigmentation effects to {{different parts of the}} body. Pigmentation effects appear in regard to yellow Labradors, and sometimes chocolate, and hence the majority of this section covers pigmentation within the yellow Labrador. The most common places where pigmentation is visible are the nose, lips, gums, feet, tail, and the rims of the eyes, which may be black, brown, light yellow-brown ("liver", caused by having two <b>genes</b> for chocolate), or several other colours. A Labrador can carry <b>genes</b> for a different colour, for example a black Labrador can carry recessive chocolate and yellow <b>genes,</b> and a yellow Labrador can carry recessive <b>genes</b> for the other two colours. DNA testing can reveal some aspects of these. Less common pigmentations (other than pink) are a fault, not a disqualification, and hence such dogs are still permitted to be shown.|$|E
5|$|Mutations {{can involve}} large {{sections}} of a chromosome becoming duplicated (usually by genetic recombination), which can introduce extra copies of a gene into a genome.
