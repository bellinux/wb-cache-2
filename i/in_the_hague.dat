5|$|In June 2011, Pre-Trial Chamber II {{requested}} that the Prosecutor, defendants, and victims comment {{on the possibility of}} holding the confirmation of charges hearings in Kenya rather than <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Hague.</b> This move was supported by Amnesty International, which claimed that holding the hearings in Kenya would bring the justice process closer to victims. The idea of holding the hearings in Kenya was also supported by the defendants Francis Muthaura and Henry Kosgey, with Mathaura suggesting holding the hearings in a military barracks for enhanced security as well as suggesting the possibility of holding the hearings in Arusha, Tanzania, which is the location of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The move was opposed by the Prosecution, who cited security concerns as an obstacle, and also by Ali, Kenyatta, Ruto, and Sang who cited the possibility that a change of venue would lead to delays in the trial process in submissions made to the Court. On 29 June Judge Trendafilova ruled that the hearings will take place at the seat of the Court <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Hague.</b>|$|E

In response, Soegijapranata encouraged eligible clergy to apply for Indonesian citizenship, circumventing the new laws.|$|E
