40|$|This letter {{presents}} a novel microstrip structure using a nanoscale porous substrate filled by a ferromagnetic material, forming {{an array of}} nanowires perpendicular to the ground plane. When compared with photonic bandgap structures, the stopband behavior is created here by a <b>gyromagnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> phenomenon in the metallic nanowires. This resonance is tuned {{by means of a}} de magnetic field parallel to the nanowires, in a very good agreement with the gyromagnetic theory, Also, tuning can be achieved over more than one octave, because the nanoscale geometry ensures that fields penetrate into the whole wire area up to 40 GHz. Other advantages are detailed in the letter...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{broad-band}} {{characterization method}} {{based on the}} junction of the full-wave analysis of a nonreciprocal strip transmission line with a predictive permeability tensor model is presented. The aim of this method is the direct measurement of the permeability tensor components spectra of magnetized thick samples, whatever their magnetization state is. The propagation constants of the dominant transverse electromagnetic (TEM) and higher order modes inside the measurement cell are obtained along with its scattering parameters (S-parameters). The apparition of magnetostatic modes and the nonreciprocal nature of the structure are probed. Procedures based {{on the use of}} this method to find accurate values of <b>gyromagnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> and the resonance line width DH are proposed. The direct analysis is validated by comparison of the calculated S-parameters with those obtained with an electromagnetic field simulator based on finite element methods (FEM) ...|$|E

40|$|Self-organization is a {{property}} of dissipative nonlinear {{processes that are}} governed by an internal driver and a positive feedback mechanism, which creates regular geometric and/or temporal patterns and decreases the entropy, in contrast to random processes. Here we investigate {{for the first time}} a comprehensive number of 16 self-organization processes that operate in planetary physics, solar physics, stellar physics, galactic physics, and cosmology. Self-organizing systems create spontaneous order out of chaos, during the evolution from an initially disordered system to an ordered stationary system, via quasi-periodic limit-cycle dynamics, harmonic mechanical <b>resonances,</b> or <b>gyromagnetic</b> <b>resonances.</b> The internal driver can be gravity, rotation, thermal pressure, or acceleration of nonthermal particles, while the positive feedback mechanism is often an instability, such as the magneto-rotational instability, the Rayleigh-Bénard convection instability, turbulence, vortex attraction, magnetic reconnection, plasma condensation, or loss-cone instability. Physical models of astrophysical self-organization processes involve hydrodynamic, MHD, and N-body formulations of Lotka-Volterra equation systems. Comment: 61 pages, 38 Figure...|$|R
40|$|It {{is argued}} {{that in the long}} {{wavelength}} limit of electromagnetic, far infrared, field optical response of an ultrafine metal particle threaded by uniform magnetic field can be properly modeled by equations of semiclassical electron theory in terms of the surface inertial-wave-like oscillations of free electrons driven by Lorentz restoring force. The detailed calculation of the frequency of size-independent <b>gyromagnetic</b> plasmon <b>resonances</b> computed as a function of multipole degree of electron cyclotron oscillations is presented. This spectrum is derived in juxtaposition with the canonical Mie's spectral formula for the surface plasmon resonances caused by the Coulomb-force-driven plasma oscillations of conduction electrons.

40|$|A second {{harmonic}} tunable RF cavity {{is being developed}} for the Fermilab Booster. This device, which promises reduction of the particle beam loss at the injection, transition, and extraction stages, employs perpendicularly biased garnet material for frequency tuning. The required range of the tuning is significantly wider than in previously built and tested tunable RF devices. As a result, the magnetic field in the garnet comes fairly close to the <b>gyromagnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> line {{at the lower end}} of the frequency range. The chosen design concept of a tuner for the cavity cannot ensure uniform magnetic field in the garnet material; thus, it is important to know the static magnetic properties of the material to avoid significant increase in the local RF loss power density. This report summarizes studies performed at Fermilab to understand variations in the magnetic properties of the AL 800 garnet material used to build the tuner of the cavity. Comment: 4 p...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of magnetic state (saturated or unsaturated states) on the <b>gyromagnetic</b> <b>resonance</b> damping in relaxing rare earth substituted Y 1 -xDyxGd 2 Fe 5 O 12 garnets (with x= 0; 0. 15; 0. 3; 0. 6) has been studied. The damping parameter α, {{as defined by}} Landau-Lifshitz equation, has been determined either by FMR at 10 GHz (saturated state) or by measurement of the frequency dependence of the complex initial permeability in the 0. 1 GHz- 10 GHz band (unsaturated state). On the one hand, the damping parameter αsat has been calculated by fitting the FMR spectra of single crystals with the theoretical lorentzian shape. On the other hand, the damping parameter αunsat of polycrystals has been calculated using models which {{take into account the}} interaction between magnetic domains. In the fully magnetized state the introduction of relaxing rare earth (Dy) is found to increase significantly αsat values (from 0. 02 to 0. 3 when x varies from 0 to 0. 6). On the contrary, the introduction of Dy hardly increases αunsat values. It appears that the difference between αsat and αunsat values stems not only from the interaction between magnetic domains but also from the modification of the damping in each magnetic domain owing to the presence of magnetic domain walls...|$|E
