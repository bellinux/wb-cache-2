The new commission recommended that the Old Post Office be torn down in favor of completing the plan for the Federal Triangle. The temporary commission managed to prevent development of the avenue which was contrary to the draft plan, but <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> able to win congressional approval for its plan. It ceased to function on November 15, 1969, due to lack of funds. A permanent Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation (PADC) was finally created by Congress on October 30, 1972.|$|E

500|$|In {{his review}} {{of the first two}} episodes of the season, Brian Lowry of Variety said that while [...] "You're Gonna Love Tomorrow" [...] is {{satisfactory}} and establishes the five-year jump effectively, the second episode is better, calling it [...] "a knock-out." [...] Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker commended the time jump as a reflection of both the characters' and series' ambitions, rating the episode a 'B+'. Joanna Weiss of The Boston Globe gave the episode a mixed review. She said that the time leap proved to be successful, as the show had been [...] "flailing" [...] for several seasons and concluded that, [...] "so far, at least, this season promises to be less about plot than personality. That doesn't mean the show is perfect - <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> - but it's better, and that's a big relief." [...] The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Rob Owen was positive in his review, noting that the writers handled the five-year leap well, especially in regards to Lynette's storyline. He complimented the episode's comedy and expressed his hope that the time jump would allow the writers to focus on humor rather than overly-dramatic storylines.|$|E
500|$|After the 2000s, {{the effects}} of poptimism {{attracted}} a belief that once a pop star reaches {{a certain level of}} stardom, many critics will safeguard them from negative reviews. Richards argued that poptimism cheerleads the already successful while privileging consensus and smothering dissent. New York Times Magazines Saul Austerlitz called poptimism a product of click-driven internet journalism that aspired to the lowest common denominator while being actively hostile to people who are fans of genres and bands associated with rockism. He further criticized it for allowing pop music fans to avoid expanding their taste and contrasted the types of music lauded by poptimists with the literature and film praised by book and film critics. Loss agreed with Austerlitz's text: [...] "When [...] wrote that '(m)usic criticism's former priority—telling consumers what to purchase—has been rendered null and void for most fans. In its stead, I believe, many critics have become cheerleaders for pop stars,' I imagined an editor and a record label exec swooping down on him saying, [...] "Don't tell them that!" [...] We like to believe criticism is devoid of crass commercialism, but Austerlitz gives away that <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> in the first place." [...] He also noted a minuscule number of lowly-rated albums in publications such as Rolling Stone, Pitchfork, and PopMatters, and that [...] "telling consumers what to purchase is still the point of a lot of music 'criticism'." ...|$|E

500|$|SpongeBob SquarePants was an {{immediate}} hit. Within its first month on air, it overtook Pokémon (1997) as the highest-rated Saturday morning children's series. By the end of 2001, the show boasted the highest ratings of any children's series on television. Nickelodeon began adding SpongeBob SquarePants to its Monday-through-Thursday prime-time block. This programming change {{increased the number of}} older viewers significantly. By May 2002, the show's total viewership reached more than 61 million, 20 million of which were aged 18 to 49. Hillenburg did not expect the show would be very popular even to adults: [...] "I never imagined that it would get to this point. When you set out to do a show about a sponge, you can't anticipate this kind of craze. We just try to make ourselves laugh, then ask if it's appropriate for children. I can tell you that we hoped it would be liked by adults. But we really thought the best we could hope for was a college audience." [...] SpongeBob SquarePants has gone on {{to become one of the}} longest-running series on Nickelodeon. [...] "Ten years. I never imagined working on the show to this date and this long. <b>It</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> possible to conceive that. ...I really figured we might get a season and a cult following, and that might be it," [...] Hillenburg said in 2009 during the show's tenth anniversary. Its popularity has made it a media franchise, which is the most-distributed property of MTV Networks. , it has generated $12 billion in merchandising revenue.|$|E
500|$|Around the holidays, {{he was so}} broke he had {{to borrow}} money for groceries. Bissell {{was found dead in}} his {{apartment}} in Hoboken, New Jersey on December 29, 1987. At the time of his death, he was engaged to fellow dancer at the American Ballet Theatre, soloist Amy Rose, and had planned to rejoin the company in January of the following year. The results of an autopsy showed that he died from an overdose of cocaine, codeine, methadone and other drugs. <b>It</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> determined whether Bissell's death was a deliberate suicide. His death prompted charges of extensive drug use in the dance world by Bissell's parents and fellow-dancer Gelsey Kirkland. Kirkland's autobiography Dancing on My Grave mentions Bissell's frequent use of cocaine and, when discussing her own addiction, she alleged that he had introduced her to the drug. Attention was also drawn to the drug therapy program offered by the American Ballet Theatre. According to the company's executive director, Charles Dillingham, Bissell had been participating in the therapy program instituted by the company and had [...] "appeared to have been making progress" [...] prior to his death. Gelsey Kirkland alleged that Bissell's death was [...] "an unavoidable tragedy caused at least in part by the failure of the ballet world and American Ballet Theater in particular to acknowledge and deal openly with the drug problem", which contrasted with [...] Dillingham's statement that [...] "his death came as an utterly horrible surprise". The 1988 production of La Bayadère by the American Ballet Theatre was dedicated to Bissell who had been notable in the rôle of Solor.|$|E

2500|$|After {{living in}} Los Angeles for 30 years, Ronstadt moved to San Francisco {{because she said}} she never felt at home in Southern California.

In many ways it has kept this ethic throughout its expansion. <b>It</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> simply another fraternity to be invited.

2500|$|Writing in the 1940s, Caracostea {{pleaded for}} the poem to be [...] "re-invoked" [...] and kept alive, its themes and hidden {{meanings}} explained to successive generations. A while after, Constantinescu was to note that, [...] "a Romantic {{in his work}} and in his life, Eminescu {{never had a chance}} to enjoy, after his death, a destiny like the Morning Star, with whom he identified, and if his glow was indeed 'deathless', <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> 'cold'." [...] This popular enthusiasm for the poem has been criticized by some scholars, who noted its negative implications. According to Eugen Negrici, the [...] "Eminescu myth" [...] is a resilient element of literary culture, leading from a poète maudit trope to the [...] "aggressive tabooing and delirium about genius." [...] As he notes, Luceafărul was an especially important as autofiction, encouraging [...] "analogical reasoning" [...] among its readers: [...] "the text has produced exhilaration in academia and has stirred affection for the poet, a distortion sparked by the mystique of writings which bear the mark of destiny".

When asked about the slideshow presentation of his animated shorts {{in an interview with}} The College Hill Independent, Neely felt that the approach was not [...] "an aesthetic choice, it was sort of the only thing I was able to do.

But, <b>it</b> <b>never</b> <b>was</b> something I felt I was needing to defend or stick to, or that it represented me artistically." [...] Other changes to the art style from the shorts were dictated by animation director, Mike L. Mayfield. Weidenfeld stated that Mayfield [...] "was instrumental in turning Brad's original style into what we had the first season." [...] Among them were the addition of pupils which, according to Weidenfeld, some of Neely's fans were unhappy over.
