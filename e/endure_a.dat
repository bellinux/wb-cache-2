5|$|It also tolerates {{a variety}} of soil conditions. Although young {{specimens}} perform best when planted {{in a mixture of}} peat and either sand or perlite, P.atriplicifolia can thrive in sandy, chalky, or loamy soil, or heavy clay soil with sufficient drainage. It can <b>endure</b> <b>a</b> wide range of soil pH, as well as exposure to salty conditions near oceans. Its deep-feeding taproot makes it especially drought tolerant; for this reason it has seen wide use for xeriscaping in the Intermountain West. Overwatering and over-fertilization can damage its roots and lead to a rapid decline in health. P.atriplicifolia is otherwise generally free from plant pathogens. In cultivation, it is also rarely selected as forage by grazing animals, and so is considered both a deer-resistant and rabbit-resistant plant.|$|E
5|$|Little {{was known}} {{about the impact of}} spaceflight on living creatures at the time of Laika's mission, and the {{technology}} to de-orbit had not yet been developed, so Laika's survival was never expected. Some scientists believed humans would be unable to survive the launch or the conditions of outer space, so engineers viewed flights by animals as a necessary precursor to human missions. The experiment aimed to prove that a living passenger could survive being launched into orbit and <b>endure</b> <b>a</b> Micro-g environment, paving the way for human spaceflight and providing scientists with some of the first data on how living organisms react to spaceflight environments.|$|E

5|$|The {{first week}} {{stabbing}} {{was regarded as}} similar to the Murder of Jonathan Levin. ABC sent the media the first two episodes prior to the season 6 premiere. In the first episode, Smits is both stabbed and inadvertently cut by his dentist. Based {{on the first two}} episodes, Dave Matheny and Neal Justin of the Star Tribune determined that Simone would <b>endure</b> <b>a</b> worsening mysterious illness. In the third episode of the arc, Smits was hospitalized and in need of a heart transplant. The fourth episode was a buildup to impending heart surgery as he struggles with cardiomyopathy.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{does well}} in his first fights, mainly because he is {{competing}} against opponents almost as out of shape as he is. At every match, he follows Moe's advice and gains widespread attention, eventually becoming the top ranked fighter in the Springfield Hobo Boxing Association. Moe's former boxing manager Lucius Sweet visits Moe and announces that the current Heavyweight Champion Drederick Tatum is being released from prison and is ready for a comeback fight, and Sweet wants Tatum to fight Homer. Lucius hopes that due to Homer's fame as a human punching bag, he will at least be able to <b>endure</b> <b>a</b> few rounds. Moe, despite knowing that Tatum is far too strong for a fighter of Homer's ability, promises Sweet that Homer will last three rounds with Tatum.|$|E
5|$|In early April 1941, the battalion, less 'D' Company which {{travelled}} {{west for}} home leave, entrained at Oakbank, near to Woodside, South Australia {{where they had}} moved the previous February. From there, the battalion travelled overland to Sydney where they embarked upon the SS Ile de France from Pyrmont Wharf, bound for the Middle East, {{as part of a}} large convoy of troopships. Sailing via Fremantle where 'D' Company rejoined the battalion, they sailed on to Colombo, which was reached in late April, where the troopship put in for repairs and shore leave was given to all battalion personnel. Departing again in early May, they continued on alone, crossing the Red Sea in a week and making landfall at Port Tewfik. The troops had to <b>endure</b> <b>a</b> two-day wait before disembarkation whereupon they were taken to {{the eastern side of the}} Suez Canal by lighter and then transferred by train to Kantara.|$|E

5|$|The {{record of}} events during the mid {{part of the}} twelfth century {{suggests}} that Leinster-based overkings of Dublin enjoyed {{the cooperation of the}} indigenous leaders of Dublin, and the emergence of the Meic Torcaill during this period may well fit into such a context. When an indigenous ruler was not to be found, however, the Dubliners seem to have sought leadership from the Isles, rather than <b>endure</b> <b>a</b> non-Leinster overking, as evidenced by the aforesaid episode concerning Gofraid. Mac Murchada's considerable authority in Dublin at this point is apparent through several ecclesiastical grants, foundations, and appointments. Furthermore, two major military operations undertaken by Dublin's forces in 1164 and 1165 were almost certainly conducted under Mac Murchada's authority. The former campaign, recorded by the thirteenth/fourteenth-century texts Brut y Tywysogyon and Brenhinedd y Saesson, concerned naval manoeuvres off Wales, in the service of Henry II, King of England (died 1189). The latter campaign, recorded by the Annals of Ulster, consisted of involvement in the ill-fated invasion of mainland Scotland, launched by Somairle mac Gilla Brigte, King of the Isles (died 1164).|$|E
5|$|Barcelona begin {{start off}} {{the season with}} the {{traditional}} curtain raiser, the Supercopa de España, against Sevilla, losing the first leg 3–1 at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium. In the return leg at the Camp Nou, however, the team would win 4–0, thus claiming the Supercopa 5–3 on aggregate. In the 2010–11 season, Barcelona would <b>endure</b> <b>a</b> slow start to the campaign, despite a victory over Racing de Santander (3–0) on {{the opening day of}} the season; they would go on to be defeated 2–0 at the Camp Nou by newly promoted minnows Hércules. Nevertheless, Barça would recover and go on to magnificent 5–0 win over Real Madrid at home. In the Champions League semi-finals against Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu, Lionel Messi scored two goals to ensure a 0–2 win for Barcelona, with the second leg at home ending in a 1–1 draw, sending Barça through to the Final to take on Manchester United. In the Copa del Rey Final at the Mestalla Stadium against Real Madrid, Cristiano Ronaldo would convert a header on the 100th minute to win the Copa for Madrid, 1–0. Barça, however, would end up beating Manchester United 3–1 with goals from Pedro, Messi and David Villa to win them the Champions League for the fourth time in club history. Barcelona would also claim La Liga with 96 points to Real Madrid's 92 {{for the third time in}} a row to round off a very successful season.|$|E

25|$|In some Native American cultures, severe {{penalties}} {{could be}} imposed on an adulterous wife by her husband.
