40|$|Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is {{a disease}} of {{the central nervous system}} that is {{considered}} a public health problem in endemic areas. The definitive diagnosis of this disease is made using a combination of tools that include imaging of the brain and immunodiagnostic tests, but the facilities for performing them are usually not available in endemic areas. The immunodiagnosis of NCC is a useful tool that can provide important information on whether a patient is infected or not, but it presents many drawbacks as not all infected patients can be detected. These tests rely on purified or semipurified antigens that are sometimes difficult to prepare. Recent efforts have focused on the production of recombinant or synthetic antigens for the immunodiagnosis of NCC and interesting studies propose the use of new elements as nanobodies for diagnostic purposes. However, an <b>immunodiagnostic</b> <b>test</b> that can be considered as “gold standard” has not been developed so far. The complex nature of cysticercotic disease and the simplicity of common immunological assumptions involved explain the low scores and reproducibility of immunotests in the diagnosis of NCC.

Of the 100 serum samples from epileptic patients, 13 were positive and 87 negative by EITB. Compared to Western blot Tsol-p 27, immunodot blot Tsol-p 27 offered similar specificity (97. 8 % vs. 95. 6 %) but better sensitivity (86. 7 % vs. 76. 4 %).

Invasive candidiasis (IC) has an associated mortality rate of around 50 %, with the diploid, pleomorphic yeast, Candida albicans responsible for up to 60 % of cases. Current <b>immunodiagnostic</b> <b>tests</b> for IC are based on the detection of circulating mannan antigen (Mn) and anti-mannan antibody (A-Mn) in a patient’s serum, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) format. The high rate of false negative results in immunocompromised patients unable to produce sufficient levels of antibody, and false positive results in patients with superficial, non-invasive colonisation has encouraged the development of new non-invasive <b>immunodiagnostic</b> <b>tests</b> that rapidly and more accurately detect IC. In this study, hybridoma technology was used to produce a murine monoclonal antibody (MAb), MC 3, which binds to a carbohydrate epitope present on an extracellular mannan-containing antigen in C. albicans yeast and hyphal morphotypes. The MAb is highly specific, reacting with antigens from several Candida species known to cause IC, but not with antigens from a large number of clinically important fungi, including the invasive human pathogens Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus. The MAb was used in combination with a standard mycological growth medium to develop an ELISA for differentiation of C. albicans from other pathogenic yeasts in single and mixed species cultures, substantially improving in vitro detection methods using mycological culture. In future, the MAb will be incorporated into the rapid, point-of-care lateral-flow device (LFD) diagnostic format, previously used successfully in the detection of invasive aspergillosis (IA).

The diagnostic {{sensitivity of the}} EgHF-ELISA was 91 %. With regard to the test specificity of the EgHF-ELISA (overall 5 82 %), we observed relatively frequent cross-reactions in tumor patients (6 %) and in patients with other parasitic diseases. Cestode-related cross-reactivity can be resolved by the complementary use of E. multilocularis-specific antigens or Taenia solium cysticercosis–specific immunoblotting. Immunoblotting based upon the detection of antibody reactivity to the 8 -kD antigen of EgHF, or if appropriately detectable, to the 29 -kD and 34 -kD bands exhibited a 91 % diagnostic sensitivity and an overall spec-ificity of 97 % or 94 %, respectively.

Using a solid phase (Sepharose 4 B) two-site immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) employing hyperimmune rabbit antifilarial antisera, we have previously shown (Hamilton et al., 1984) that essentially all cases of patent (ie. microfilaremic) infection in patients with bancroftian filariasis can be detected by this semi-quantitative assay {{as well as some}} individuals with amicrofilaremic (i. e., 'cryptic') infection.

It was run in SDS-PAGE, blotted to nitrocellulose paper and identified autoradiographically using 125 I-labelled rabbit antifilarial antiserum. Its high molecular weight (approximately 200 kD), stability to acid and boiling, and sensitivity to pronase and periodate suggest its being a glycoprotein.

40|$|Since {{the advent}} of human {{immunodeficiency}} virus infection, with its profound and progressive effect on the cellular immune system, a group of human opportunistic pathogens has come into prominence. Opportunistic parasitic infection can cause severe morbidity and mortality. Because many of these infections are treatable, an early and accurate diagnosis is important. This {{can be accomplished by}} a variety of methods such as direct demonstration of parasites and by serological tests to detect antigen and/or specific antibodies. However, antibody response may be poor in these patients and therefore <b>immunodiagnostic</b> <b>tests</b> have to be interpreted with caution. Cryptosporidium parvum, Isospora belli, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Microsporidia, Entamoeba histolytica and Strongyloides stercoralis are the commonly detected parasites. Detection of these parasites will help in proper management of these patients because drugs are available for most of these parasitic infections...|$|R
