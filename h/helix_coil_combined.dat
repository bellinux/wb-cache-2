40|$|ABSTRACT: Simple <b>helix</b> <b>coil</b> {{transition}} {{theories have}} been indispensable {{tools in the}} analysis of data reporting on the reversible folding of α-helical polypeptides. They provide a transferable means to not only characterize different systems but to also compare different techniques, viz., experimental probes monitoring <b>helix</b> <b>coil</b> transitions in vitro or biomolecular force fields in silico. This article addresses several issues with the application of Lifson Roig theory to <b>helix</b> <b>coil</b> transition data. We use computer simulation to generate two sets of ensembles for the temperature-controlled, reversible folding of the 21 -residue, alanine-rich FS peptide. Ensembles differ in the rigidity of backbone bond angles and are analyzed using two distinct descriptors of helicity. The analysis unmasks an underlying phase diagram that is surprisingly complex. The complexities give rise to fitted nucleation and propagation parameters that are difficult to interpret and that are inconsistent with the distribution of isolated residues in the α-helical basin. We show that enthalpies of helix formation are more robustly determined using van’tHoffanalysis of simple measures of helicity rather than fitted propagation parameters. To overcome some of these issues, we design a simple variant of the Lifson Roig model that recovers physical interpretability of the obtained parameters by allowing bundle formation to be described in simple fashion. The relevance of our results is discussed in relation to the applicability of Lifson Roig models to both in silico and in vitro data. Elucidating the <b>helix</b> <b>coil</b> transition microscopically has long been deemed to be of utmost importance for the understandin...|$|R

Experimental data was presented {{in the form of}} average heat transfer coefficient and two-phase friction factor. Comparison of the experimental heat transfer coefficient with the predicted values obtained from the Jung, Murata and Thome methods confirms a good accuracy of these methods although they were developed for the straight tube-in-tube heat exchanger. The predicted two-phase friction factor values obtained from the Martinelli correlation deviates more than 50 % from the experimental results for the three working fluids.

By this method we can calculate many chemical and biochemical properties of large scale biological systems. In this work all-atom molecular dynamics simulation of polyalanine (PA) was investigated {{in the presence of}} 0. 224, 0. 448, 0. 673, 0. 897 and 1. 122 M of guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) at 273 - 395 K by molecular dynamics simulation. Analysis of surface area, radial distribution function, radius of gyration, heat capacity, hydrogen bond, <b>helix,</b> <b>coil</b> and beta contents showed that an intermediate appears on the way of <b>helix</b> to <b>coil</b> transition. GdmCl at low concentration increases the midpoint of transition temperature (Tm), number of solvent molecules in the hydration layer and interapeptide hydrogen bond as well as decreases in rate of <b>helix</b> to <b>coil</b> transition.

50|$|However, if an uncompensated {{sample is}} to be analyzed, it becomes {{essential}} to cool the sample to 25 °C +/- 1 °C. This {{can be achieved by}} two-stage cooling. In the first stage cooling (also known as 'primary cooling'), the sample is cooled by using available cooling water. In most of the countries, cooling water is available in the range of 30-32 °C. This cooling water can cool the sample unto 35 °C(considering an approach temperature of 3 to 5 °C). A sample cooler is used to achieve this. Sample cooler is a heat exchanger specially designed for SWAS applications. Preferred sample cooler for primary cooling is a double <b>helix</b> <b>coil</b> in shell type design providing contraflow heat exchange.|$|R

The approach is motivated by the observation of a bias in the sec-ondary structure preferences of free cysteines and half-cystines, and by promising preliminary results we obtained using diresidue position-specific scoring matrices. Results: As calibrated by receiver operating characteristic curves from 4 -fold cross-validation, our conditioning on secondary structure allows our novel diresidue neural network to perform as well as, {{and in some cases}} better than, the current state-of-the-art method.

50|$|A {{torsion spring}} is a spring that works by torsion or twisting; that is, a {{flexible}} elastic object that stores mechanical energy {{when it is}} twisted. When it is twisted, it exerts a force (actually torque) in the opposite direction, proportional to the amount (angle) it is twisted. There are two types. A torsion bar is a straight bar of metal or rubber that is subjected to twisting (shear stress) about its axis by torque applied at its ends. A more delicate form used in sensitive instruments, called a torsion fiber consists of a fiber of silk, glass, or quartz under tension, that is twisted about its axis. The other type, a helical torsion spring, is a metal rod or wire {{in the shape of}} a <b>helix</b> (<b>coil)</b> that is subjected to twisting about the axis of the coil by sideways forces (bending moments) applied to its ends, twisting the coil tighter. This terminology can be confusing because in a helical torsion spring the forces acting on the wire are actually bending stresses, not torsional (shear) stresses.|$|R
