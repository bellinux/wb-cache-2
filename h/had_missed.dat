5|$|The Baltimore Ravens {{selected}} Smith {{with the}} 58th overall {{pick in the}} second round of the 2011 NFL Draft. Smith, who ran the 40-yard dash in 4.41 seconds at the combine, was described as a deep threat that the team <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> the previous season.|$|E
5|$|A dry track during Q2 {{saw the two}} Mercedes drivers fastest, Rosberg four-tenths of {{a second}} faster than Hamilton. Fernando Alonso failed {{to make it into}} Q3, the seventh time that season. He <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> the last part of {{qualifying}} seven times over the entire course of his Ferrari stint in the five previous seasons. Daniel Ricciardo was eliminated in 14th place, meaning that he - like Button - was unable to take the full extent of his ten-place grid penalty.|$|E

No! nor the good Carrier, so jovial and so ruddy, {{at the bottom}} of the table. Nor the brown, fresh sailor-fellow, and his {{handsome}} wife. Nor any one among them. To <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> the dinner would <b>have</b> been to <b>miss</b> as jolly and as stout a meal as man need eat; and to <b>have</b> <b>missed</b> the overflowing cups in which they drank The Wedding Day would have been the greatest miss of all.|$|R

5|$|After {{a drunken}} and violent fight with Graham in 1938, Scott {{returned}} to Asheville. A group from Zelda's hospital {{had planned to}} go to Cuba, but Zelda <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> the trip. The Fitzgeralds decided to go on their own. The trip was a disaster even by their standards: Scott was beaten up {{when he tried to}} stop a cockfight and returned to the United States so intoxicated and exhausted that he was hospitalized. The Fitzgeralds never saw each other again.|$|E
5|$|At 21, Leicester's David Nish {{became the}} {{youngest}} ever captain of a cup finalist. His opposite number Tony Book became the third oldest at 35. Book <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> {{a large part of}} season through injury, but upon returning his impact was so great that he shared the award for the 1969 FWA Footballer of the Year.|$|E

He made it a {{condition}} of his acceptance that Northcott be given the appointment of Commander-in-Chief of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) in Japan. Sturdee felt that Northcott <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> out on opportunities for active service through his being CGS and saw the BCOF post as a just reward for that service.|$|E

5|$|Fourteen horses {{started at}} the 2013 Belmont Stakes. Oxbow drew the number seven post position, with rival Orb at post five. There were {{concerns}} about Stevens' fitness as he <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> races after being thrown from a horse the previous week, but medical tests {{showed no sign of}} injury. Oxbow was the third favorite at 5–1 on the morning line, but by race time his odds were at 10–1.|$|E
5|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} this interaction, Presley and Jackson spoke on the telephone almost every day, forging a strong friendship. The two came to realize they had much in common: both had been protected and sheltered from the real world, both felt they <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> out on a normal childhood, both were mistrustful of outsiders having {{spent most of their}} lives feeling exploited by them, and both had problems with the media. Presley was raised in Graceland, while Jackson lived at Neverland.|$|E
5|$|Simms {{made his}} Football League debut at Lincoln City {{in place of}} Caesar Jenkyns, who <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> his train. In bitterly cold weather, after snow had been cleared from the pitch, Lincoln took {{advantage}} of winning the toss by choosing to play downhill, and took a 2–1 lead. On change of ends, Small Heath {{came back into the}} game, and scored twice {{in the last quarter of}} an hour to take the game 4–3.|$|E

5|$|The first 14 {{picks in}} the draft belonged to teams that <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> the playoffs; the order was {{determined}} through a lottery. The lottery determined the three teams that would obtain the first three picks on the draft. The remaining first-round picks and the second-round picks were assigned to teams in reverse order of their win-loss record in the previous season. As it is commonplace {{in the event of}} identical win-loss records, the NBA performed a random drawing to break the ties on April 18, 2008.|$|E

5|$|A strong game by Doug Williams {{carried the}} Buccaneers despite an anemic rushing attack. Both teams later complained about officiating errors and the {{malfunctioning}} game clock. The Metropolitan Stadium 30-second clock failed {{for the second}} week in a row, as did both regulation clocks. The Buccaneers survived a last-minute drive by the Vikings in which quarterback Tommy Kramer was penalized for throwing a pass from beyond the line of scrimmage, which helped to keep the Vikings out of field goal range. Curtis Jordan sealed the victory by deflecting Kramer's last-second Hail Mary pass. Kramer later admitted to being aware of having crossed the line of scrimmage, but had hoped that the officials would miss it as they <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> so many other penalties in the game.|$|E

5|$|After {{a year in}} San Diego, Washington {{was traded}} again. Levin decided to acquire Portland center Bill Walton even though Walton <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> the entire 1978–79 season due to broken bones in his foot. Since the Blazers and Clippers could not agree on compensation, the commissioner's office made the final decision, sending Washington, Kunnert and Randy Smith to Portland in {{exchange}} for the center. This became the second time he had been traded along with Kunnert. The center signed with Boston before the 1978–79 season even though Washington was on the team because the Celtics offered him the most money. There remained a mostly quiet discord between the two as Washington felt Kunnert never properly acknowledged his role in the fight.|$|E
5|$|After reading The Last Tycoon, Zelda {{began working}} on a new novel of her own, Caesar's Things. As she <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> Scott's funeral, so she missed Scottie's wedding. By August 1943 she had {{returned}} to the Highland Hospital. She worked on her novel while checking {{in and out of the}} hospital. She did not get better, nor did she finish the novel. On the night of March 10, 1948, a fire broke out in the hospital kitchen. Zelda was locked into a room, awaiting electroshock therapy. The fire moved through the dumbwaiter shaft, spreading onto every floor. The fire escapes were wooden, and they caught fire as well. Nine women, including Zelda, died.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{made three}} changes. Having taken only seven wickets {{in the first}} four Tests at an average of 61.00, off spinner Ian Johnson was {{replaced}} by leg spinner Doug Ring. Australia's second change was forced on them; the injured medium pacer Ernie Toshack was replaced by the opening batsman Sid Barnes, who <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> the Fourth Test with a rib injury. This meant Australia were playing with one extra batsman and one less frontline bowler. The final change was the return of first-choice wicket-keeper Don Tallon from injury and the omission of his deputy Ron Saggers.|$|E

5|$|Beyond the {{negative}} impact on Bertuzzi's individual play, the media speculated that {{the fallout from the}} Moore incident had become a distraction to the organization as a whole. Compounding the situation in Vancouver, the Canucks <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> the playoffs {{for the first time in}} four years. As such, general manager Dave Nonis spent the off-season making significant changes to the Canucks lineup. On June 23, 2006, he traded Bertuzzi to the Florida Panthers, along with goaltender Alex Auld and defenceman Bryan Allen, in exchange for goaltender Roberto Luongo, defenceman Lukáš Krajíček and a sixth-round selection in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft (Sergei Shirokov). After seven-and-a-half seasons with the Canucks, Bertuzzi left the club ranked seventh all-time among franchise scoring leaders with 449 points.|$|E
5|$|Both {{halves of}} the road trace their origins to {{the early days of}} Aspen's {{settlement}} in the 1880s during the Colorado Silver Boom. Prospectors who <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> out on the earlier mining boom that built Leadville began to head west, drawn by reports of vast untapped silver deposits in the Roaring Fork Valley just beyond the Continental Divide. They began crossing what was then known as Hunter Pass, in defiance of an order from Governor Frederick Walker Pitkin not to do so until the federal government had negotiated a peace treaty with the Ute people.|$|E
5|$|Following the missed field goal, Auburn {{took over}} on offense at its six-yard line—the {{point from which}} Tech <b>had</b> <b>missed</b> the kick. Ronnie Brown picked up 13 yards and a first down on three rushes. Carnell Williams then picked up three yards, and Jason Campbell threw a seven-yard pass that gave Auburn another first down. A five-yard penalty against Virginia Tech pushed Auburn's offense near midfield, and Ronnie Brown {{returned}} to the field, rushing the ball four consecutive times for 16yards and driving the Tigers into Virginia Tech territory. Facing a fourth down and one yard, Auburn elected to give the ball to Brown again. On the one-yard run, however, Brown fumbled the ball, which was recovered by Virginia Tech's Mikal Baagee with 8:38 remaining.|$|E
