2500|$|Another {{piece to}} <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> {{the effects of}} rater {{motivation}} on judgmental evaluations. [...] It {{is not uncommon for}} rating inflation to occur due to rater motivation (i.e. [...] "organizationally induced pressures that compel raters to evaluate ratees positively"). [...] Typically, raters are motivated to give higher ratings {{because of the lack of}} organizational sanction concerning accurate/inaccurate appraisals, the rater's desire to guarantee promotions, salary increases, etc., the rater's inclination to avoid negative reactions from subordinates, and the observation that higher ratings of the ratees reflect favorably upon the rater.|$|E

[...] "Very little was based on the stories that Matt Drudge himself wrote. The fact that the Drudge Report appears left of center is merely a reflection of the overall bias of the media." [...] Professor Mark Liberman critiqued the statistical model used in this study on the basis that model assumed conservative politicians do not care about the ideological position of think tanks they cite, while liberal politicians do. The study was also criticized by media watchdog Spinwatch for its methodology and its authors' ties to conservative think tanks.|$|E

50|$|A {{ground grid}} is {{provided}} primarily for safety, {{and the size}} of the conductors is probably governed by local building or electrical code. One factor to <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>is</b> that since the final grid will have multiple paths to ground, the final system resistance to ground will likely be lower than for a typical star ground. But this does not change the need for adequate conductor size to any given piece of equipment in case of a fault.|$|E
