5000|$|Over time, {{it became}} common to bind maps {{together}} into composite works. Although the word [...] "atlas" [...] {{was not in}} use for these composite works until 1570, they now are termed [...] "IATO Assembled To Order atlases" [...] or, more frequently, [...] "Lafreri atlases" [...] (one of the leading publishers of the period, Antonio Lafreri {{is thought to have}} been the first to add an <b>engraved</b> <b>title</b> <b>page</b> to a collection of maps - around 1570 or 1572 {{about the same time as}} the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum was published in Antwerp.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>engraved</b> <b>title</b> <b>page</b> of Uranometria {{is signed}} {{in the shadows}} of the central scroll at the bottom with the {{monogram}} AMF, for [...] "Alexander Mair fecit", and the date MDCIII. It features an architectural motif with the full title in the center. On pedestals to either side stand figures of Atlas and Hercules. Inscriptions in the pedestals read, [...] "Atlanti uetustiss astronom magistro" [...] ("Atlas the earliest teacher of astronomy") and [...] "Herculi uetustiss astronom discipulo" [...] ("Hercules the earliest student of astronomy"). Across the top of the title page are engraved several additional figures. In the upper left is Apollo, personifying the sun. Top center is the Earth goddess Cybele with a crown of stars and two lions on leashes. Upper right is Diana, personifying the moon, with a cape of stars. Beneath the title banner is a figure of Capricorn and beneath that a view of Augsburg.|$|E
50|$|The <b>engraved</b> <b>title</b> <b>page</b> {{engravings}} made {{allusion to}} temples, caciques, {{and other aspects}} of the Americas, as well as portraits of some of the Spanish conquistadors, including his fellow cuellaranos Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar, Juan de Grijalva, and Captain Gabriel de Rojas y Córdova. These portraits constitute an accurate collection of the most famous of the conquistadors, {{and many of them are}} unique, which makes them especially exceptional. The Décadas are considered a work not subject to influence, since the author did not live through the experiences he describes, attempting to acquaint the reader with them through the chronicles of his predecessors in his post and other learned men of letters, and through all the official documents which, due to his position, he had within reach, coming from books of the Cámara de Castilla and the papers from the archive of the Council of the Indies, so that it was the first history of the Americas which used all the available historical sources and so was the first general history of the Americas.|$|E

50|$|He is also closely {{associated}} with the first printed collection of music for smallpipes, A Favorite Collection of Tunes with Variations Adapted for the Northumberland Small Pipes, Violin, or Flute, published by William Wright, of Newcastle, probably in 1801. The book had an <b>engraved</b> <b>title</b> <b>page</b> in the style of Thomas Bewick, and probably from his workshop, and the 1801 date is suggested by entries in the account books of Thomas Bewick for work done for Wright, between February and June 1801; in any case, Wright gave the address of his shop as High Bridge, so the date of publication definitely preceded the move of the business from High Bridge to Pilgrim Street, which he announced in April and May 1803.As well as containing 50 tunes for smallpipes, the book also contains an engraving, also thought to have been done in Bewick's workshop, showing 2 chanters and their fingering charts; one is a simple keyless chanter with an octave range from G to g, the other is J. Peacock's New Invented Pipe Chanter with the addition of Four Keys, these keys were for the notes low D, E, F sharp, and high a. Peacock was thus probably the first player of the instrument to play an extended keyed chanter. Such chanters continued to be developed in {{the first decades of the}} 19th century, by John Dunn, in association with Peacock, and slightly later by Robert Reid, and subsequently by others, including Reid's son James.|$|E
