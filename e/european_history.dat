5|$|Among {{the results}} of the Greek and Islamic {{influence}} on this period in <b>European</b> <b>history</b> was the replacement of Roman numerals with the decimal positional number system and the invention of algebra, which allowed more advanced mathematics. Astronomy advanced following the translation of Ptolemy's Almagest from Greek into Latin in the late 12th century. Medicine was also studied, especially in southern Italy, where Islamic medicine influenced the school at Salerno.|$|E

5|$|The second Persian {{invasion}} of Greece was {{an event of}} major significance in <b>European</b> <b>history.</b> A large number of historians hold that, had Greece been conquered, the Ancient Greek culture {{that lies at the}} basis of Western civilization would have never developed (and by extension Western civilization itself). While this may be an exaggeration, it is clear that even at the time the Greeks understood that something very significant had happened.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Marathon was a {{watershed}} in the Greco-Persian wars, showing the Greeks that the Persians could be beaten; the eventual Greek triumph in these wars {{can be seen}} to begin at Marathon. The battle also showed the Greeks {{that they were able to}} win battles without the Spartans, as they had heavily relied on Sparta previously. This win was largely due to the Athenians, and Marathon raised Greek esteem of them. Since the following two hundred years saw the rise of the Classical Greek civilization, which has been enduringly influential in western society, the Battle of Marathon is often seen as a pivotal moment in Mediterranean and <b>European</b> <b>history.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Great Salt Lake entered written <b>European</b> <b>history</b> {{through the}} records of Silvestre Vélez de Escalante, who learned of its {{existence}} from the Timpanogos Utes in 1776. No European name was given to it at the time, {{and it was not}} shown on the map by Bernardo Miera y Pacheco, the cartographer for the expedition. In 1824, it was observed, apparently independently, by Jim Bridger and Etienne Provost. Shortly thereafter other trappers saw it and walked around it.|$|E

5|$|The {{rule of the}} Jagiellonian dynasty in Poland between 1386 and 1572 {{spans the}} late Middle Ages and early Modern Era in <b>European</b> <b>history.</b> The dynasty was founded by the Lithuanian Grand Duke Jogaila (Władysław II Jagiełło), whose {{marriage}} to Queen Jadwiga of Poland formed a Polish–Lithuanian union. The partnership brought vast territories controlled by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania into Poland's sphere of influence and proved beneficial for both the Polish and Lithuanian people, who coexisted and cooperated {{in one of the}} largest political entities in Europe for the next four centuries.|$|E
5|$|With the {{repatriation}} of Ukrainians from Poland to the Soviet Union and the 1947 Operation Vistula dispersing the remaining Ukrainian minority, and {{with most of}} the former Jewish minority exterminated by Nazi Germany during the Holocaust and many of the survivors emigrating to the West and to newly created Israel, Poland for the first time became an ethnically homogeneous nation state. The government-imposed and spontaneous movements of people amounted to one of the greatest demographic upheavals in <b>European</b> <b>history.</b>|$|E

5|$|Reflecting a new revolutionary {{era in the}} <b>European</b> <b>history</b> {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of the French Revolution, the authors expressed sharp social criticism, castigating the corruption of the church authorities, the idleness of the monasticism, and popular superstition. They also appealed for reform of the language, education, and change to the social mores as a way to overcome backwardness and to renew people's mentality with a more western view. They claimed that Greece is positioned within a Europe defined by the dynamics of political reforms from old and corrupt monarchical regimes to new republican communities. The modern innovative spirit of Geographia Neoteriki was also expressed in the use of a lively and malleable vernacular (Demotic) language with very few ties to the katharevousa, a more archaich form of Greek, which was commonly used by most Greek scholars of that time.|$|E
5|$|Year 1346 (MCCCXLVI) was {{a common}} year {{starting}} on Sunday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. It was {{a year in the}} 14th century, {{in the midst of a}} period known in <b>European</b> <b>history</b> as the Late Middle Ages. In Asia that year, the Black Plague came to the troops of the Golden Horde Khanate; the disease also affected the Genoese Europeans they were attacking, before spreading to the rest of Europe. In Central and East Asia, there was a series of revolts after Kazan Khan was killed in an uprising, and the Chagatai Khanate began to splinter and fall; several revolts in China began what would eventually lead to the overthrow of the Yuan dynasty. The Indian kingdom of Vijayanagara won several victories over Muslim conquerors in the north in this year as well.|$|E
