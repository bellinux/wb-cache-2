Seamless vertical handover {{is an important}} function of Beyond 3 G systems. Context transfer can help support seamless vertical handover while maintaining required security level. So as to come to solutions for <b>security</b> <b>context</b> transfer, this paper first analyses trust relationship between different participants of vertical handover and gives a definition of <b>security</b> <b>context.</b> Context transfer schemes for no coupling, loose coupling and tight coupling of networks are then presented...|$|R

40|$|Many {{solutions}} for securing inter-provider handover proposed to date {{make use of}} the concept of <b>security</b> <b>context</b> transfer. However, none of these solutions addresses problems arising from subsequent handover. In this paper, we provide a formal model for subsequent <b>security</b> <b>context</b> transfer and define a set of security requirements. We furthermore present a new solution that meets all but one of these requirements. In particular, we combine the concept of a history-enriched <b>security</b> <b>context</b> transfer with a policy-based handover decision process. 1...|$|R
40|$|While mobile nodes (MNs) undergo handovers across inter-wireless access networks, their <b>security</b> <b>contexts</b> must be {{propagated}} for secure re-establishment of on-going application sessions, such {{as those}} in secure mobile internet protocol (IP), authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) services. Routing <b>security</b> <b>contexts</b> via an IP network either on-demand or based on MNs' mobility prediction, imposes new challenging requirements of secure cross-handover services and <b>security</b> <b>context</b> management. In this paper, we present a context router (CXR) that manages <b>security</b> <b>contexts</b> in an all-IP network, providing seamless and secure handover services for the mobile users that carry multimedia-access devices. A CXR is responsible for (1) monitoring of MNs' cross-handover, (2) analysis of MNs' movement patterns, and (3) routing of <b>security</b> <b>contexts</b> ahead of MNs' arrival at relevant access points. The predictive routing reduces the delay in the underlying security association that would otherwise fetch an involved <b>security</b> <b>context</b> from a remote server. The predictive routing of <b>security</b> <b>contexts</b> is performed based on statistical learning of MNs' movement pattern, gauging (dis) similarities between the patterns obtained via distance measurements. The CXR has been evaluated with a prototypical implementation based on an MN mobility model on a grid. Our evaluation results support the predictive routing mechanism's improvement in seamless and secure cross-handover services by a factor of 2. 5. Also, the prediction mechanism is shown to outperform the Kalman filter-based method [13] as a Kalman Fiter-based mechanism up to 1. 5 and 3. 6 times regarding prediction accuracy and computation performance, respectively.

S. policy makers claim that {{nuclear weapons are}} needed to <b>guarantee</b> <b>security</b> commitments and discourage the international spread of nuclear weapons. This thesis evaluates the link between <b>security</b> <b>guarantees</b> and efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation. It draws three conclusions based on case studies {{of the use of}} conventional security commitments and nuclear <b>security</b> <b>guarantees</b> to prevent nuclear weapons development in South Korea and Taiwan. First, nuclear <b>security</b> <b>guarantees</b> alone are not sufficient to prevent proliferation. Second, strong conventional commitments made credible by visible presence of forces are sufficient to prevent nuclear proliferation when the direct security threat is conventional. Third, when the security threat being faced includes nuclear weapons, nuclear proliferation prevention requires both a nuclear <b>security</b> <b>guarantee</b> and a physically evident conventional military guarantee. Two implications for security policy follow from these findings. First, nuclear weapons are necessary in the modem security environment. Second, nuclear <b>security</b> <b>guarantees</b> are not credible without the stationing of conventional forces[URL] United States Nav...|$|R

The most attractive assets are the cryptographic keys stored into the non volatile memory (NVM) area. Most of the researches try to obtain them through side channel attacks or fault attacks.

Such a smart card embeds a firewall that provides isolation between applets from different clients (using the notion of <b>security</b> <b>contexts).</b> We exploit the client/server architecture of the intra platform communication to lure a client application to execute within its <b>security</b> <b>context,</b> a hostile code written and called from another security context: the server <b>security</b> <b>context.</b> This attack shows the possibility for a trusted application to execute within its <b>security</b> <b>context</b> some hostile code uploaded previously by the server...|$|R

50|$|The {{concept of}} type {{enforcement}} (TE) {{in the field}} of information technology is related to access control. Implementing TE gives priority to “mandatory access control” (MAC) over “discretionary access control” (DAC). Access clearance is first given to a subject (e.g. process) accessing objects (e.g. files, records, messages) based on rules defined in an attached <b>security</b> <b>context.</b> A <b>security</b> <b>context</b> in a domain is defined by a domain security policy. In the Linux security module (LSM) in SELinux, the <b>security</b> <b>context</b> is an extended attribute. Type enforcement implementation is a prerequisite for MAC, and a first step before “multi-level security” (MLS) or its replacement “multi categories security” (MCS). It is a complement of “role based access control” (RBAC).|$|R
30|$|After {{running the}} initial AKA {{protocol}} in the source network, the mobile device and the AS would have shared the <b>security</b> <b>context</b> {{that consists of}} the UID, MS, AK, and SK. In case of a handover, the <b>security</b> <b>context</b> is transferred, over a presumably secure channel from the old AS to the new AS in the destination network. This means that, the <b>security</b> <b>context</b> is always shared between the mobile device and the network, it also implies that, only the SK is re-established on handover, while the re-establishment of the AK and the authentication process happen after the handover. As stated in [7], the SK transferred during the context transfer continues to be used until the new SK is established.|$|R
