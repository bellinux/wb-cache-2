Moreover, firm valuation and performance are relatively higher for firms with controlling shareholders when compared to firms without controlling shareholders...|$|E

With greater activism among shareholders and the shift from plurality to majority voting for directors, the number of close votes is rising. But is the basic technology of corporate voting adequate to the task? In this Article, we first examine the incredibly complicated system of US corporate voting, a complexity that {{is driven by the}} underlying custodial ownership structure, by dispersed ownership and large trading volumes, and by the rise in short-selling and derivatives. We identify three ways in which things predictably go wrong: pathologies of complexity; pathologies of ownership; and pathologies of misalignment of interests. We then discuss the current legal treatment of these pathologies and consider a variety of directions for reform, ranging from incremental modifications to fundamental redesign. We show that, absent a fundamental reconstruction of the ownership structure, the existing system will continue to be noisy, imprecise and disturbingly opaque. The problems with the existing system pose fundamental challenges for both proponents of <b>direct</b> <b>shareholder</b> democracy, who advocate more extensive voting rights for shareholders, and for proponents of indirect shareholder democracy, who advocate deference to a board of directors the legitimacy of which ultimately also rests on shareholder elections...|$|E

The Names were both <b>direct</b> <b>shareholders</b> and, crucially, {{those who had}} obtained a stake through another third-party agent. It was held that Merrett Syndicates was liable to both types of shareholders, as there was enough foreseeability to extend pure economic loss liability to [...] "un-proximate" [...] third parties. The major significance here was, however, the allowance of claims in both contract and tort, which blurred the divide between the two.

This new system was a type of book-entry direct registration system (DRS) operated by stock transfer agent. This concept would allow any retail investor who wants his or her securities to be registered directly on the books of the issuer, but does not necessarily want to receive a certificate, to register those securities in book-entry form directly on the books of the issuer. The DRS concept {{has been slow to}} develop for two reasons. First, many investors do not understand that if they give up paper certificates while joining a DRS, this will return them to the status of <b>direct</b> <b>shareholders</b> of the issuer rather than just customers of a broker (who is the registered shareholder {{in the eyes of the}} issuer), and second, once brokers and banks had been inserted as the [...] "indispensable" [...] middlemen between shareholders and issuers, they were not eager to surrender this privileged position of control.

A well-designed {{corporate}} governance regime is an important tool to make the transition period shorter and less painful. After reviewing the partially or wholly privatised European telecom sector, the paper proposes eight lessons for policy makers in charge of designing privatisation. First, where the State remains an important owner after partial privatisation, it should organise its shareholding function to pursue exclusively shareholder value objectives. Second, any privatisation-related asymmetries between control and cash-flow rights among shareholders should be limited in time and scope. Third, while some minority shareholder power, such as <b>direct</b> <b>shareholder</b> nomination and cumulative voting are welcome, the board needs to develop its own cohesiveness and culture. Fourth, the board should be actively and effectively involved in the development and validation of the company's strategy and the control of major transactions. Fifth, the privatised firms should strive to list in a market with high and credible disclosure requirements. Sixth, privatised firms should focus on developing a disclosure culture, especially as regards non-financial disclosure.

40|$|Part B. of {{the paper}} compares the basic {{concepts}} of shareholder control in Anglo-America and some states of Continental Europe. It introduces a new categorization between Implicit and Explicit Systems of Corporate Control. The first category refers to statutes that are enacted and construed {{with the belief that}} market forces influence managers. Shareholder rights to be exercised in direct contact with the corporation are thought to be relatively weak. This system is established in the Anglo-American world. In contrast, <b>direct</b> <b>shareholder</b> influence through voting and (even minority) shareholder monitoring constitute the fundaments of the Explicit System that traditionally prevailed, for example, in France and Germany. This paper provides historical, statutory and new empirical evidence from some Continental jurisdictions, and in particular Germany. It concludes that in Germany, shareholder meetings are part of Corporate Governance, while the Anglo-American corporate world traditionally understood this term to include only inter-board relationships. Part C. analyses the questions of whether, how and why Corporate Governance systems converge. This study suggests that Corporate Governance systems are likely to develop in Convergence Cycles: If a legal regime provides a particularly efficient solution to a specific problem, this solution will eventually be adopted by other Corporate Governance systems with an inferior system in respect of such problem. These Convergence Cycles will finally overcome the forces against formal convergence. The proposition of Convergence Cycles draws on historical, as well as new statutory and empirical evidence, collected by the author. Part D., finally, analyses the likely impact of convergence on ownership structures. It is likely that {{the answer to the question}} of which ownership structure is efficient depends on the stage of the business cycle that the firm is at. Firms within the same stage are likely to become more and more similar with respect to their ownership structures, until they reach an equilibrium that is set at a specific point for a particular group of firms. Thus, this paper adds a dynamic perspective to the static views that presently prevail in the debate upon the convergence of ownership structures...|$|E
40|$|Lucrative pay to {{corporate}} managers remains controversial yet continues to evade judicial scrutiny for legitimacy. Although many arrangements likely would pass the most rigorous scrutiny, it seems equally clear that some would not. Some agreements {{are not the}} product of arm’s-length bargaining, can rivet managers on short-term stock prices at the destruction of long-term business value, and can misalign manager-shareholder interests. Yet even such objectionable arrangements are immune from serious legal oversight. In theory, they are open to judicial review under corporate law, but shareholders challenging pay contracts face formidable procedural hurdles in derivative litigation and substantive obstacles from corporation law’s business judgment rule and the anemic doctrine of waste. A new legal theory {{would be useful to}} check board excesses in the population of clearly objectionable cases. This Article explains why and how traditional contract law’s theory of unconscionability should be used to create a modicum of judicial scrutiny to strike obnoxious pay contracts and preserve legitimate ones. Under this proposal, pay contracts that are the product of managerial domination of the process and formed on terms massively favoring the executive will be stricken. This will follow <b>direct</b> <b>shareholder</b> lawsuits in state courts where the contract is made or performed and applying that state’s contract law. This new legal theory circumvents today’s dead-end route, where pay contracts are always upheld in derivative shareholder lawsuits applying corporate law that sets no meaningful limits on executive pay. This proposal creates new but modest pressure from sister states on Delaware to take greater responsibility for the effects its production of corporate law has nationally. For those outraged by lopsided corporate executive compensation, this Article offers an appealing new legal theory of contractual unconscionability to police them. Those who see no or few problems with contemporary pay arrangements, or who are outraged by federal regulatory schemes like the Dodd-Frank Act, will welcome how this proposal is narrowly tailored using common law to address the most obnoxious cases...|$|E

Based on the global reporting initiative (GRI) guidelines, we use content analysis to assess the value relevance of CSR disclosures of 130 German companies over 4 years. Germany is an interesting setting as CSR disclosures are mostly voluntarily, even though the institutional environment appears sensitive to CSR disclosures. Our results show that CSR information is value-relevant, but the value relevance of CSR information differs amongst CSR categories. Specifically, the disclosure of social (i. e. employee-related) information is positively associated with firm value yet environmental disclosures are not.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{relationship}} between board of directors (BoD) and corporate performance in China. In particular, it attempts to identify the effects of four attributes of BoD board composition, characteristics of directors, board structure and board process on the financial performance of Chinese listed companies. A large number of empirical studies have examined the correlation between BoD and corporate performance. Few previous studies have examined the effects of BoD on both <b>direct</b> <b>shareholder</b> wealth and company financial performance. Moreover, little attention has been paid to this topic in a Chinese context. Owing to special ownership structure of listed companies, agency problems have recently received more and more attention in China from the academics and policy makers. As noted by Qian (1995) and Firth et al. (2003), agency problems in China are potentially more serious than in the West. Therefore, this study mainly employs agency theory to examine the effects of the BoD on corporate performance. It is utilised, together with other theories, such as resource dependence theory, to develop testable hypotheses and discuss the results. This study finds that there is relatively limited evidence that board independence has significantly positive impacts on corporate performance. In particular, it finds that there is non-linear relationship between board independence and firm performance. There is no negative relation between the proportion of affiliated directors on board and firm current or future performance. In addition, there is no significantly negative correlation between board size and firm current performance. In particular, there is no non-linear relationship between board size and corporate performance. There is no confirmative evidence that stock ownership and cash compensation of independent directors have any positive effects on corporate financial performance. However, there is strong evidence that firm performance depends crucially on the interaction between the magnitude of cash compensation of independent directors and the size of them on board. Also there is no evidence that the incentives of independent directors have any curvilinear effects on current performance. There is no evidence of significantly positive or negative correlation between age and primary occupation of independent directors and firm performance. However, I find that the presence of overseas independent directors has significantly positive impacts on corporate performance. Interestingly, there is a significantly negative correlation between the proportion of female independent directors and corporate performance. There is no clear evidence that CEO duality has any negative impact on current financial performance, which rejects the hypothesis H 5. Furthermore, there is a significantly negative relationship between multi-directorship and firm performance. In addition, there is limited evidence that auditing committee has a significantly positive impact on corporate performance. There is no significantly positive correlation between the frequency of board meeting and firm financial performance. However, there is strong evidence that firm performance depends crucially on the interaction between the frequency of board meetings and the size of independent directors appointed. In particular, there is confirmative evidence that frequency of board meeting has curvilinear effect on firm performance. There is no clear evidence that the proportion of directors appointed by government agents control shareholders has a negative impact on corporate performance. However, there is a significantly negative correlation between the proportion of directors appointed by SOE control shareholders and company performance. Furthermore, the relationship between the proportion of directors appointed by SOE control shareholders and company performance is non-linear. The dissertation makes several important contributions to the corporate governance literature. In addition, this study also has implications for policy makers insofar as it offers empirical evidence concerning effectiveness of Chinese BoD in improving financial performance of listed companies.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the power of}} corporate social responsibility to reduce information asymmetry and {{to act as a}} marketing instrument in the banking sector. Trust is the most important asset of a bank. Therefore, banks are motivated to use the most effective instruments to diminish information asymmetry with their stakeholders. The fact that cash disbursements in CSR actions are not <b>directed</b> towards <b>shareholders</b> makes them more valuable signals to other stakeholders regarding the financial soundness of the bank. The empirical study conducted based on limited dependent variable models supports the effectiveness of the CSR as marketing instrument in banking. It reveals the circumstances associated to a higher probability of an active CSR policy conducted by a banking institution. The results support the hypothesis that in the banking sector CSR is perceived as an instrument which helps stakeholders reduce information asymmetry. As marketing instrument, CSR contributes to increasing the tangibility of the banking products, decreasing their perceived variability and thus making them more attractive for the clients and allowing for differentiation between competitors...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{corporate}} social responsibility and its benefits has been discussed at length in both industry and academia. Much of the discussion has focused on what actually constitutes social responsibility and, {{given the nature of}} directors' responsibilities, whether or not corporations should be held accountable for the implementation of social policies {{that may or may not}} benefit <b>direct</b> <b>shareholders.</b> W hat is often missed in these discussions is that, irrespective of the company direction, decisions are made by individuals within that organization and therefore the issue of individual ethics is brought into play. Replicating a study by Girodo (1998) with police managers, this thesis examines the ways in which hospitality leaders in Australia seek to influence others in the workplace. One hundred and thirty three managers of hotels rated as three, four or five stars according to the Australian Automobile Association participated in this study, of which 91 provided answers to all questions. Factor analysis, MANOVA of factor scores across groups and t tests were used to identify differences across and amongst the groups to derive the results. The results indicate that the prevailing leadership styles in Australia are a blend of Machiavellian (manipulative) and Bureaucratic styles and that variance in this choice correlates with the age of the respondent. That is, the older the manager, the less Machiavellian or Bureaucratic they become. Based on the relationships explored by Hitt (1990), these leadership styles indicate that older managers are less inclined to use a utilitarian or rule-based ethical decision-making style, and more inclined to embrace a social contract or personalistic ethic approach. This is in line with general moral development theories that suggest we embrace more enlightened morals as we age. The difference in the use of various decision-making styles appears to correspond closely to generational differences; there is evidence that different styles are used by Baby Boomers, Generation X and Generation Y leaders. This finding warrants a closer review as it indicates that Generation Y leaders, in particular, are quite different in their expectations of their roles in work and, in fact, will make quicker decisions to move jobs if they feel they are not recognized or rewarded appropriately. Their application of ethics is also quite different to Baby Boomers in that they apply far greater weight to the here and now, and to the majority, than to the future or the individual needs of orthers...|$|R

This is so because more independent directors—regarded as better monitors of managerial activities—will be elected. In the model, a manager maximizes his expected utility by solving the trade-off between reputation and consumption of private benefits. The board can be of high-type (independent, only cares about reputation) or low-type (non-independent, faces a trade-off similar to the manager's). When the board can signal its type at a relatively small cost, giving <b>shareholders</b> <b>direct</b> access to proxy is better than delegating the nomination of outside directors to managers: in the first alternative, only high-type boards will be kept, whereas in the second, low-type boards will predominate.

This paper raises selective, critical issues of corporate governance that are particularly relevant to problems of the accountability of boards of directors to their shareholders in transition economies.
