5|$|The {{domestic}} dwellings of <b>elite</b> <b>and</b> ordinary Egyptians alike {{were constructed}} from perishable {{materials such as}} mud bricks and wood, and have not survived. Peasants lived in simple homes, while the palaces of the <b>elite</b> <b>and</b> the pharaoh were more elaborate structures. A few surviving New Kingdom palaces, {{such as those in}} Malkata and Amarna, show richly decorated walls and floors with scenes of people, birds, water pools, deities and geometric designs. Important structures such as temples and tombs that were intended to last forever were constructed of stone instead of mud bricks. The architectural elements used in the world's first large-scale stone building, Djoser's mortuary complex, include post and lintel supports in the papyrus and lotus motif.|$|E
5|$|The {{odds were}} against {{successful}} applications, and only approximately 40,000 a year were approved. Refusal was often arbitrary, {{dependent on the}} goodwill of local officials.

However, they were not permitted to take their families with them.|$|E

5|$|A {{dispute over}} the {{succession}} to Edward led to the Norman conquest of England in 1066, accomplished by an army led by Duke William of Normandy. The Normans themselves originated from Scandinavia and had settled in Normandy in the late 9th and early 10th centuries. This conquest led to the almost total dispossession of the English <b>elite</b> <b>and</b> its replacement by a new French-speaking aristocracy, whose speech had a profound and permanent effect on the English language.|$|E
5|$|Aburish {{asserts that}} Nasser was not distressed by his {{frequent}} relocations, which broadened his horizons {{and showed him}} Egyptian society's class divisions. His own social status was well below the wealthy Egyptian <b>elite,</b> <b>and</b> his discontent with those born into wealth and power grew throughout his lifetime. Nasser {{spent most of his}} spare time reading, particularly in 1933 when he lived near the National Library of Egypt. He read the Qur'an, the sayings of Muhammad, the lives of the Sahaba (Muhammad's companions), and the biographies of nationalist leaders Napoleon, Atatürk, Otto von Bismarck, and Garibaldi and the autobiography of Winston Churchill.|$|E
5|$|According {{to their}} Confucian ethics, <b>elite</b> <b>and</b> cultured scholar-officials viewed {{themselves}} as the pinnacle members of society (second only to the imperial family). Rural farmers were seen as the essential pillars that provided food for all of society; they were given more respect than the local or regional merchant, no matter how rich and powerful. The Confucian-taught scholar-official elite who ran China's vast bureaucracy viewed their society's growing interest in commercialism {{as a sign of}} moral decay. Nonetheless, Song Chinese urban society was teeming with wholesalers, shippers, storage keepers, brokers, traveling salesmen, retail shopkeepers, peddlers, and many other lowly commercial-based vocations.|$|E

5|$|An <b>elite</b> <b>and</b> {{well trained}} force of bodyguards known as Garudas {{protected}} {{the members of}} the royal family at all times. These servants moved closely yet inconspicuously by the side of their master, their loyalty being so complete that they committed suicide after his death. Hero stones (virgal) erected in memory of these bodyguards are called Garuda pillars. The Garuda pillar at the Hoysaleswara temple in Halebidu was erected in honor of Kuvara Lakshma, a minister and bodyguard of King Veera Ballala II.|$|E
5|$|As of 2006, the IFNA {{recognises}} only women's netball. Men's netball teams {{exist in}} some areas but attract less attention from sponsors and spectators. Men's netball started to become popular in Australia during the 1980s, and the first men's championship was held in 1985. In 2004, New Zealand and Fiji sent teams {{to compete in the}} Australian Mixed and Men's National Championships. By 2006, mixed netball teams in Australia had as many male participants as rugby union. Other countries with men's national teams include Canada, Fiji, Jamaica, Kenya, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates. Unlike women's netball at <b>elite</b> <b>and</b> national levels, men's and mixed gendered teams are largely self-funded.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Arab Revolt and its aftermath, Aleppo's {{political}} elite was divided between those who embraced the Arab nationalist movement led by Faisal and those who sought political autonomy for Aleppo and its hinterland within the Ottoman state. A number of factors distinguished the attitudes of Aleppo's <b>elite</b> <b>and</b> populace from those of Damascus. For one, the economic well-being of Aleppo's inhabitants was dependent on open, commercial access to Aleppo's Anatolian hinterland, which was predominantly populated by Turks; southwestern Anatolia was the principal market for Aleppo's goods and the principal supplier of its food and raw materials.|$|E

5|$|Cossa's {{body was}} moved to the Baptistry and the nine-day funeral, as {{prescribed}} by the Ordo Romanus, was well-attended by the Florentine <b>elite</b> <b>and</b> the papal court. Cossa's corpse was crowned with a white mitre with his cardinal's hat at his feet on the funerary bier during the rituals, which took place entirely within the Baptistry and Duomo. The first three days of ceremonies celebrated in turn Cossa's role as cardinal and pope, his role as an ally of Florence, and his role as a private citizen. He received a temporary burial until the tomb was complete.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though most}} {{consumer}} items {{are in short}} supply in North Korea, there is a considerable variety of cigarettes available. In general, strong tobacco is preferred, and filters are rare. Western brands, particularly American, but also Chinese, Russian and Japanese are popular with the <b>elite</b> <b>and</b> preferred over domestic cigarettes. Foreign cigarettes and the domestic 727 brand, whose name stands for 27 July, the date of the Korean Armistice Agreement, are veritable status symbols. Menthol cigarettes are virtually non-existent, but there is competition among tobacco companies to introduce other attractive products, such as fruit-flavoured balls inside the filter to give the cigarette flavour.|$|E

5|$|Maya art is {{essentially}} {{the art of the}} royal court. It is almost exclusively concerned with the Maya <b>elite</b> <b>and</b> their world. Maya art was crafted from both perishable and non-perishable materials, and served to link the Maya to their ancestors. Although surviving Maya art represents only a small proportion of the art that the Maya created, it represents a wider variety of subjects than any other art tradition in the Americas. Maya art has many regional styles, and is unique in the ancient Americas in bearing narrative text. The finest surviving Maya art dates to the Late Classic period.|$|E

In 1912, Nasib graduated from the al-Sultaniya School of Beirut. When Sharif Hussein's son, Faisal, visited Syria in early 1916, he lodged in the al-Bakris' summer house in Qaboun, outside of Damascus. Prior to this, Nasib and his brothers Fawzi and Sami had joined the budding al-Fatat movement, an underground society advocating Arab independence from the Ottomans. Nasib had become the movement's secretary.|$|E
