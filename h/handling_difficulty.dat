40|$|Frequency {{multipliers}} {{are required}} as local oscillator sources for frequencies up to 2. 7 THz for FIRST and airborne applications. Multipliers at these frequencies have not previously been demonstrated, {{and the object}} of this work was to show whether such circuits are really practical. A practical circuit is one which not only performs as well as is required, but also can be replicated in a time that is feasible. As the frequency of circuits is increased, the difficulties in fabrication and assembly increase rapidly. Building all of the circuit on GaAs as a monolithic circuit is highly desirable to minimize the complexity of assembly, but at the highest frequencies, even a complete monolithic circuit is extremely small, and presents serious <b>handling</b> <b>difficulty.</b> This {{is compounded by the}} requirement for a very thin substrate. Assembly can become very difficult because of handling problems and critical placement. It is very desirable to make the chip big enough to that it can be seen without magnification, and strong enough that it may be picked up with tweezers. Machined blocks to house the chips present an additional challenge. Blocks with complex features are very expensive, and these also imply very critical assembly of the parts. It would be much better if the features in the block were as simple as possible and non-critical to the function of the chip. In particular, grounding and other electrical interfaces should be done {{in a manner that is}} highly reproducible...|$|E

The scope of work is diverse, with projects ranging from single acquisitions to collections of projects and operations that span several decades and costs from hundreds of millions to billions US$. The {{need to be able}} to manage and understand the technical risks from the project to senior management level has been recognized as an enabler to successfully completing the mission. In 2008, DOE-EM developed the Technical Risk Rating as a new method to assist in managing technical risk based on specific criteria. The Technical Risk Rating, and the criteria used to determine the rating, provides a mechanism to foster open, meaningful communication between the Federal Project Directors and DOE-EM management concerning project technical risks. Four indicators (technical maturity, risk urgency, <b>handling</b> <b>difficulty</b> and resolution path) are used to focus attention on the issues and key aspects related to the risks. Pressing risk issues are brought to the forefront, keeping DOE-EM management informed and engaged such that they fully understand risk impact. Use of the Technical Risk Rating and criteria during reviews provides the Federal Project Directors the opportunity to openly discuss the most significant risks and assists in the management of technical risks across the portfolio of DOE-EM projects. Technical Risk Ratings can be applied to all projects in government and private industry. This paper will present the methodology and criteria for Technical Risk Ratings, and provide specific examples from DOE-EM projects...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an experiment that investigated {{the potential benefits}} of virtual reality (VR) environments in supporting assembly planning. In the experiment, fifteen sub-jects performed an assembly planning task in three different conditions: a traditional engineering environment (TE), a nonim-mersive desktop VR (DVR) environment, and an immersive care automatic virtual environment (CAVE) VR environment (CVR environment). The effects of the three conditions on the subjects’ performance were analyzed. The subjects ’ performance time in the TE condition was significantly longer than that in the DVR condition and that in the CVR condition, whereas the difference in performance time between the DVR condition and the CVR condition was not significant. The total number of problematic assembly steps in the TE condition was significantly greater than that in the CVR condition. Specifically, the subjects ’ assembly sequences in the TE condition involved more reorientations than in the DVR condition. The number of difficult assembly steps in the TE condition was significantly greater than that in the DVR condition, which was significantly greater than that in the CVR condition. The number of dissimilar assembly steps in the TE condition was significantly greater than that in the CVR condition, which was significantly greater than that in the DVR condition. Hence, the results revealed advantages of the two VR environments over the traditional engineering environment in improving the subjects ’ overall assembly planning performance and in minimizing the <b>handling</b> <b>difficulty,</b> excessive reorientation, and dissimilarity of assembly operations.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) {{have attracted}} considerable attention in scientific communities {{due to their}} remarkable mechanical, thermal and electrical properties (high stiffness, high strength, resilience, etc.). In particular, mechanical properties of single wall nanotubes (SWNTs) have a Young's modulus of about 1 TPa if normalized to their diameter showing why they are widely considered as reinforcing elements in advanced low weight composite structures. The determinations of mechanical properties of SWNT are currently investigated both experimentally and theoretically. However, to determine CNTs mechanical properties in a direct experimental way is a challenging and not economical task because of the technical difficulties and the costs involved in the manipulation of nanoscale objects. Due to the <b>handling</b> <b>difficulty,</b> estimation of mechanical properties using computer simulations are being performed by several author with different approaches. In this work a Finite Element Model of SWNTs based on molecular mechanics theory is proposed to evaluate mechanical properties as Young's modulus, ultimate strength and strain. The novelty of the model lies {{on the use of}} non-linear and torsional spring elements, to evaluate SWNTs mechanical properties and tensile failure. With this approach, it was possible to model the bond interaction without making any assumption on non-physical variable, i. e. area, inertia of atom interaction when using beam approach. With the proposed model it was able to understand the evolution of the tensile failure of nanotubes. Moreover, it is {{important to point out that}} while most of the fracture evolution studies use molecular dynamics theory and technique, the proposed approach leaded to a minor computational time with the possibility to simulate large atoms system.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{identify}} children’s different ways of experiencing and <b>handling</b> <b>difficulties</b> in the pre-school class’s pedagogical circle time and increase our understanding of children’s actions in a situation they regard as difficult. It is a question of studying children’s experiencing in relation to what and how aspects, how difficulties are manifested in the actions of children and children’s and teacher’s perspectives on this. Questions based on the aim are formulated as follow: What do children experience as difficult in pedagogical circle time? How do children <b>handle</b> these <b>difficulties?</b> How do children act to solve these difficulties? How do teacher’s act to help the children solve these difficulties? The theoretical starting points consist of the developmental pedagogic theory, a special needs communicative, relation-oriented perspective and the symbolic interactionism. The focus is on the concepts of variation with respect to the what and how aspect in children’s experiencing (developmental pedagogy), participation, communication and learning (a communicative, relation-oriented perspective) and action/symbol, interaction, language and identity/self (symbolic interactionism). Children’s perspectives and a pre-school class for all children are reflected in the theoretical starting-points. Children’s perspectives are a common denominator in all three theoretical starting-points. The research group of 115 children consisted of 15 different pre-school classes in 12 different schools. Sixty-one of the children were girls and 54 boys. Data collection methods are: video recording/observation using a digital video camera with a monitor and feedback on videotaped observation – interviews with children in the form of talk about questions based on the videotaped circle time context. The theoretical starting points/analytical concepts are discussed together in order to show the breadth provided by the data. If only a theoretical starting point had been used, {{it would not have been}} possible to describe the picture provided by the data to the same extent. One starting point shows one way of describing a situation while several starting points describe and bring out several aspects of a situation. The three theoretical starting points/analytical concepts are research approaches that, together and individually, emphasise children’s experience-based world/perspectives. To sum up, the analysis shows what children on a collective level experience as difficulties and how they <b>handle</b> <b>difficulties.</b> The children’s different actions in the interaction with adults and other children reveal varying ways of experiencing and <b>handling</b> <b>difficulties.</b> Difficulties emerge when there is insufficient interaction, communication and participation between teachers, children and task/content in the pedagogical circle time situation. The results in the present study show that in the interaction, sufficient attention is not always paid to children’s perspectives.
