5|$|Solar {{hot water}} systems use {{sunlight}} to heat water. In low geographical latitudes (below 40degrees) from 60 to 70% of the <b>domestic</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> use with temperatures up to 60°C {{can be provided}} by solar heating systems. The most common types of solar water heaters are evacuated tube collectors (44%) and glazed flat plate collectors (34%) generally used for domestic hot water; and unglazed plastic collectors (21%) used mainly to heat swimming pools.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{heating systems}} are a well known second-generation {{technology}} and generally consist of solar thermal collectors, a fluid system {{to move the}} heat from the collector to its point of usage, and a reservoir or tank for heat storage. The systems may be used to heat <b>domestic</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water,</b> swimming pools, or homes and businesses. The heat can also be used for industrial process applications or as an energy input for other uses such as cooling equipment.|$|E

25|$|Air-air heat pumps, that extract {{heat from}} outside air and {{transfer}} this heat to inside air, {{are the most}} common type of heat pumps and the cheapest. These are similar to air conditioners operating in reverse. Air-water heat pumps are otherwise similar to air-air heat pumps, but they transfer the extracted heat into a water heating circuit, floor heating being the most efficient, and they can also transfer heat into a <b>domestic</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> tank for use in showers and hot water taps of the building. However, ground-water heat pumps are more efficient than air-water heat pumps, and therefore they are often the better choice for providing heat for the floor heating and <b>domestic</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> systems.|$|E
25|$|There are {{millions}} of domestic installations using air source heat pumps. They are used in climates with moderate space heating and cooling needs (HVAC) and may also provide <b>domestic</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water.</b> The purchase costs are supported in various countries by consumer rebates.|$|E
25|$|The chief {{benefit is}} that by {{avoiding}} drawing-off <b>domestic</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> directly, the tank is not continually fed with cold water, which in 'hard' water areas reduces the deposit of limescale to whatever is dissolved in the original charge of water plus relatively trivial amounts added to replace losses due to seepage.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The energy {{consumptions}} {{in households}} {{and the energy}} resources used for fulfilling the energy needs have been changing in a quite short period of time. The present study aims to provide a background of the energy consumptions in Portugal in a European context. A {{significant part of the}} energy consumptions is related to buildings. It is estimated that buildings use about 40 % of all the energy needs in Europe. In that way, buildings, including households, {{play a major role in}} the energy consumptions in Europe. In Portugal the energy consumption of buildings represents about 30 % of the final energy consumption of the country and actually electricity plays a major role in the households energy needs. In European households as well as in Portuguese households the energy required is mainly for cooking, for electrical equipment, for heating and cooling the houses, for <b>domestic</b> <b>hot</b> <b>waters</b> (DHW), and for artificial lighting...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between Legionella and Pseudomonas spp contamination and mineral content of <b>domestic</b> <b>hot</b> <b>waters</b> {{was investigated in}} a cross-sectional Italian survey. Pseudomonas spp contamination was associated with elevated Ca, but lower Fe and free chlorine content in the water. Waters with Cu concentrations > 50 microg/L prevented Legionella spp colonisation (OR = 0. 14, 95 % CI = 0. 02 - 1. 13), whereas the risk of legionellae occurrence increased in waters with Mn levels > 3 microg/L (OR = 2. 37, 95 % CI = 1. 06 - 5. 30). Furthermore, Mn was positively associated with the risk of colonisation by eterotrophic bacteria growing at either 22 and 36 degrees C. Legionella species and serogroups were differently distributed according to Cu and Mn concentrations, suggesting that Legionella strains may have a different sensibility/resistance to trace elements. A specific action of Cu as decontamination factor is suggested and the consideration of Mn as a risk indicator for bacterial colonisation and biofilm presence is proposed...|$|R

25|$|While {{copper and}} {{stainless}} steel <b>domestic</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> tanks are more commonplace in Europe, carbon steel tanks are {{more common in the}} United States, where typically the periodic check is neglected, the tank develops a leak whereupon the entire appliance is replaced. Even when neglected, carbon steel tanks tend to last for a few years more than their manufacturer's warranty, which is typically 3 to 12 years in the US.|$|E
25|$|Another very {{important}} reason for using biocides in cooling towers is to prevent the growth of Legionella, including species that cause legionellosis or Legionnaires' disease, most notably L. pneumophila, or Mycobacterium avium. The various Legionella species are the cause of Legionnaires' disease in humans and transmission is via exposure to aerosols—the inhalation of mist droplets containing the bacteria. Common sources of Legionella include cooling towers used in open recirculating evaporative cooling water systems, <b>domestic</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> systems, fountains, and similar disseminators that tap into a public water supply. Natural sources include freshwater ponds and creeks.|$|E

25|$|A {{heat pump}} uses an {{electrically}} driven compressor {{to operate a}} refrigeration cycle that extracts heat energy from outdoor air, the ground or ground water, and moves that heat to the space to be warmed. A liquid contained within the evaporator section of the heat pump boils at low pressure, absorbing heat energy from the outdoor air or the ground. The vapor is then compressed by a compressor and piped into a condenser coil within the building to be heated. The heat from the hot dense gas is absorbed by {{the air in the}} building (and sometimes also used for <b>domestic</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water)</b> causing the hot working fluid to condense back into a liquid. From there the high pressure fluid is passed back to the evaporator section where it expands through an orifice and into the evaporator section, completing the cycle. In the summer months, the cycle can be reversed to move heat out of the conditioned space and to the outside air.|$|E

40|$|The general {{situation}} in the Georgian energy sector is serious. The whole energy sector was ruined {{with the collapse of}} the Soviet Union and today faces the reality of no central district heating or <b>domestic</b> <b>hot</b> tap <b>water</b> supply. Mostly, space heating changed to electric heating, which nowadays is quite expensive and inefficient. This also puts a heavy load on the electric power sector causing serious shortages in electricity during the winter. This project can thus be considered the very first step in rebuilding district heating. After many surveys and analyses, during which several district heating alternatives were evaluated, a decision was made to opt for the following project. It is a two stage project: Tap water supply using geothermal <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> as a power source, and district heating based on individual natural gas boilers.
