40|$|Wear is {{the main}} reason for the loss of {{performance}} of the parts for agricultural machinery. It leads to the degradation of the soil working quality. This work aims to highlight the wear resistance of the harrows discs manufactured, consolidated and sharpened differently. The tests were conducted in the laboratory and the field of the Faculty of Exploitation and Repair of Agricultural Machinery of the State Technical University of Kirovograd (Ukraine) in 2015. The technical equipment consists of devices for consolidation by electric discharge and for measurement the linear wear of discs, a harrow, a sand test bed, a tractor and discs made of different materials and technologies. Some parameterized were collected during the laboratory test each 5 ha and up to 20 ha of operation and in the fields each 30 ha until the time limit of exploitation. The Laboratory tests have shown that after twenty (20) ha of operation, the wear resistance of the experimental discs made of steel 65 G and consolidated by electric discharge with simultaneous grinding (sharpening angle of 30 °) is 2. 95 times higher than the discs in series made of steel 28 MnB 5. The field experiment gave the following results: According to agro technical requirements, the plowing depth limit of serial discs made of steel 28 MnB 5 was reached after an operating duration of 120 ha while for experimental discs made of steel 65 G and consolidated by electric discharge with simultaneous grinding (sharpening angle of 30 degrees) this duration is of 156 ha. The <b>diameter</b> <b>wear</b> limit of experimental discs was reached after an operating duration of 179 ha against 154 ha for the serial ones. Therefore, the new technology can be applied during the manufacture and / or the repair of the discs...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this doctoral thesis is {{the evaluation of the}} tribological properties of automotive gasoline and diesel fuel, as well as the improvement of the latter with the addition of bio-additives and biofuels. It is listed the physicochemical and tribological properties of automotive diesel fuels, heating diesel fuels and marine diesel fuels. What is typical for diesel fuel is the distinct separation between the values of the corrected wear diameter and the values of friction across the limit of 460 κm, which is noticeable difference in gradient of the linear dependence of the variance of these two values. There were samples of marine diesel that their lubricity was inappropriate and greater than the limit of 460 micrometers. It was examined the impact of biodiesel, vegetable oils and essential oils in the middle distillates fractions of oil. The methodology used to measure gasoline lubricity is the ASTM G 133 standard test method for linearly reciprocating ball-on-flat sliding wear. Taking into account the experimental condition characteristics for the assessment of lubricity of refinery streams is noticed that they are characterized by worst anti-wear properties and lubricity in relation to diesel fuels. It was measured the gasoline lubricity of mixtures that emerged from the composition of the refinery streams and correspond to commercial gasolines. The increased wear scar diameter of the refinery streams contributes to larger <b>diameter</b> <b>wear</b> for the final commercial gasolines and therefore the value of the corrected wear scar diameter depends significantly from that of the constituent refinery streams. In particular, it is evident for all 36 mixtures, the wear mechanism taking place is that of the heavy adhesive wear and mild to heavy abrasive wear, and can coexist with that of the oxidative wear. The optimum addition rate is following the mixing rules that prevail in modern refineries and specifically an optimum rate of 35 % for the stream of catalytic cracking FCC unit and 26 % for the stream of catalytic reformer unit were observed. It was measured the lubricity of commercial gasolines. For sulfur content below 50 ppm and potassium content of less than 5 ppm was noticed increased wear and in particular greater than 700 κm for all commercial gasoline types. The chlorine content varies with an average of 10 ppm for commercial gasolines by potentiometric titration. The presence of chlorine is certified by elemental analysis performed by SEM. ...|$|E

40|$|Among {{the wear}} {{quantification}} techniques applied to point contacts, the most typical one consists of measuring the longitudinal and transversal <b>wear</b> scar <b>diameters</b> of the <b>worn</b> surface. However, this method {{does not provide}} information about {{the distribution of the}} wear along the worn surfaces. As a result, the wear prediction using <b>wear</b> scar <b>diameters</b> could be misrepresentative because of the irregular shape of the worn surfaces. This drawback should be considered especially when the scope of the test method is the determination of the relative wear preventive properties of lubricants in sliding contacts. This paper compares two hydraulic lubricants from different manufacturers using a four-ball tribometer under the ASTM D 4172 standard. Wear was measured by the <b>wear</b> scar <b>diameter</b> and <b>wear</b> volume with an optical 3 D profilometer.

40|$|This program {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} common manufacturing variables on spike-tempering effectiveness. The investigation used design-of-experiment (DOE) techniques, and examined both dual-phase and martensitic grades of high-strength steels (HSS). The specific grades chosen for this project were: Dual-phase (DP) 600, galvannealed (GA), 1. 55 mm (DP) 600; Dual-phase (DP) 980 (uncoated), 1. 55 mm (DP) 980; and Martensitic (M) 1300, 1. 55 mm (M) 1300. Common manufacturing conditions of interest included tempering practice (quench and temper time), button size, simulated part fitup (sheet angular misalignment and fitup), and electrode wear (increased electrode face diameter). All of these conditions were evaluated against mechanical performance (static and dynamic tensile shear). Weld hardness data was also used to examine correlations between mechanical performance {{and the degree of}} tempering. Mechanical performance data was used to develop empirical models. The models were used to examine the robustness of weld strength and toughness to the selected processing conditions. This was done using standard EWI techniques. Graphical representations of robustness were then coupled with metallographic data to relate mechanical properties to the effectiveness of spike tempering. Mechanical properties for all three materials were relatively robust to variation in tempering. Major deviations in mechanical properties were caused by degradation of the weld itself. This was supported by a lack of correlation between hardness data and mechanical results. Small button sizes and large electrode face <b>diameters</b> (<b>worn</b> electrodes) produced large reductions in both static and dynamic strength levels when compared to standard production setups. Dynamic strength was further degraded by edge-located welds...|$|R

40|$|Surface {{roughness}} {{plays an}} important role in machine design. In the micro-scale when two engineering surfaces are brought into contact, the real contact area occurs at isolated point of asperity. Wear is one of some effects of contacting surfaces. This paper presents a modeling of sliding wear at asperity level on the artificial rough surfaces. The surface roughness is represented by spherical asperities at the hemispherical pin that is developed from the existing model. The wear model is based on the simple analytical solution. The combination of Archard 2 ̆ 7 s wear equation and finite element simulation is performed to predict the wear. Results show that the increasing of sliding distance give the increasing of wear depth, <b>wear</b> scar <b>diameter</b> and <b>wear</b> volume of the asperity.

A used drill stem is inspected on site, or off location. Ultrasonic testing and modified instruments similar to the spherometer are used at inspection sites to identify defects from metal fatigue, in order to preclude fracture of the drill stem during future wellboring.

50|$|Traditionally, {{screen cloth}} {{was made with}} metal wires woven with a loom. Today, woven cloth is still widely used {{primarily}} because they are less expensive than other types of screen media. Over the years, different weaving techniques have been developed; either to increase the open area percentage or add wear-life. Slotted opening woven cloth is used where product shape is not a priority and where users need a higher open area percentage. Flat-top woven cloth is used when the consumer wants to increase wear-life. On regular woven wire, the crimps (knuckles on woven wires) wear out faster {{than the rest of}} the cloth resulting in premature breakage. On flat-top woven wire, the cloth wears out equally until half of the wire <b>diameter</b> is <b>worn,</b> resulting in a longer wear life. Unfortunately flat-top woven wire cloth is not widely used because of the lack of crimps that causes a pronounced reduction of passing fines resulting in premature wear of con crushers.|$|R

Further, it is revealed from the analysis that an increase volume fraction of abrasive (abrasive concentration) in water results in significant decrease in the skin friction coefficient and jet exit kinetic energy...|$|R

Effectively, the car would possess no superstructure, and instead the cargo would be carried inside the car's axles themselves. Steel tires, flanged and fitted to the gauge of track, were put around the cylinders, which served as the wheels of the car. The Westinghouse Air Brake Company developed a system of air brakes specifically for this type of freight car.The prototype car underwent trials on the CB&Q Railroad, making six round trips of 200 miles each, carrying the grain magnificently and supposedly turning it {{out at the end of}} each trip one grade better than when it was first loaded. Railroad personnel were satisfied with it, since there was said to be no trouble in passing curves, frogs and switches. In addition, the car required less lubrication than conventional cars, and experienced significantly less rolling resistance due to a lower dead weight and a lower center of gravity. Due to the extremely large large wheel <b>diameter,</b> track <b>wear</b> was reduced. Due to its all-iron construction, the car was even supposedly fireproof.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{quantify}} the effect of handhold orientation, size (<b>diameter),</b> and <b>wearing</b> a glove on the maximum breakaway strength between a hand and handhold. Background: Manual breakaway strength is known to be greatly reduced for vertical compared with horizontal handholds, but oblique orientations have yet to be studied. Method: For this study, 12 young adults (6 female) attempted to hold on to fixed overhead cylindrical handholds with one hand in low-speed simulated falls as forces on the handhold were recorded in two experimental designs. Breakaway strength was measured for (a) three different-sized cylinders in four orientations while the participants were using the dominant hand and (b) a single-sized cylinder in four orientations while the participants were bare-handed or wearing a glove on the nondominant hand. Results: Handhold orientation (p <. 001), handhold diameter (p <. 001), and wearing gloves (p <. 001) significantly affected breakaway strength. Breakaway strength increased 75 % to 94 % as the orientation of the handhold was moved from vertical to horizontal. Breakaway strength decreased 8 % to 13 % for large-diameter (51 -mm) handholds as compared with smaller diameters (22 mm to 32 mm), depending on orientation. Gloves may increase or decrease the ability to hang on depending on interface friction; greater friction increased breakaway force. Conclusion: Handles oriented perpendicular to the pull direction and high-friction gloves provide the greatest breakaway strength. Smaller handhold diameters than predicted by grip strength afford greater capability in these orientations. Application: These insights can be used to design handholds that increase the ability to support one’s body weight and reduce the effort needed to pull or lift heavy items...|$|R

For instance, Aluminum Matrix Composites (AMC) shows improved mechanical properties as wear and abrasion resistance, high strength, chemical and dimensional stability. Automotive industry has focused in AMC {{for a variety of}} applications in automotive parts in order to improve the fuel economy, minimize vehicle emissions, improve design options, and increase the performance. Wear resistance {{is one of the most}} important factors in useful life of the automotive components, overall in those components submitted to mechanical systems like automotive brakes and suspensions. Friction Stir Welding (FSW) rises as the most capable process to joining AMC, principally for the capacity to weld without compromising their ceramic reinforcement. The aim of this study is focused on the analysis of wear characteristics of the friction-stir welded joint of aluminum matrix reinforced with 20 percent in weight silicon carbide composite (A 359 /SiC/ 20 p). The experimental procedure consisted in cut samples into small plates and perform three welds on these with a FSW machine using a tool with 20 mm shoulder diameter and 8 mm pin <b>diameter.</b> The <b>wear</b> features of the three welded joints and parent metal were analyzed at constant load applying 5 N and a rotational speed of 100 rpm employing a Pin-on - Disk wear testing apparatus, using a sapphire steel ball with 6 mm diameter.

The results determine that the FSW process parameters affect the wear resistance of the welded joints owing to different microstructural modifications during welding that causes a low wear resistance on the welded zone...|$|R

ABSTRACT: The report of investigation of the wear behaviour of aluminium alloy samples used in the floating calliper of master cylinder clutch or brake is presented in this paper. As-received commercial aluminium alloy sample sourced from automobile hydraulic brake cylinder calliper was melted in electric furnace under a controlled atmosphere, and sand cast at pouring temperature range of 700 - 800 oC into rod of 300 mm long by 30 mm <b>diameter.</b> A <b>wear</b> jig {{was used to determine}} the wear resistance of the aluminium samples with and without the use of hydraulic fluid. The microstructures and surface of the as-received and cast specimen were examined under high resolution microscope to assess the effects of wear with and without hydraulic oil. It was observed that the aluminium sample wears faster in the absent of hydraulic fluid and was reduced to a bearable minimum when hydraulic fluid was applied. The results obtained are presented in figures showing the wear rates and weight loss of the aluminium samples with respect to the wear cycle, from which models equations are derived. The test results show that eutectic structured cast aluminium alloy behaves relatively better than the as-received aluminium alloy specimen in oil. It is significant that the oil functions as lubricant on the alloy under test, hence the common deteriorations experience from the cast alloy under service must have aggravated from the chemical adulterations in the oil wherewith a thin film of more wear and chemical resistance would bring effective and significant wear and corrosio...|$|R

Questions/purposes We asked the following questions: Is the wear of conventional and crosslinked polyethylene liners affected by ball diameter, rigidity of backing, and liner thickness? Are the stresses in the liner affected by thickness? Methods Wear rates were measured in a hip simulator and stresses were calculated using finite element modeling.

40|$|A rail is an {{important}} and the most heavily laden element in the railway superstructure, because it functions as both the running surface used for vehicle guidance and the beam directly transmitting the load of the vehicles to the ballast bed and the railway substructure. The {{first part of the}} thesis describes the characteristics of rails and provides a theoretical background relating to rail stresses resulting from traffic load, temperature change and production procedures. When rail vehicles move, enormous contact stresses are produced in the contact zone between the wheel and the rail, which often causes damage to the running surface. Curves with smaller <b>diameters</b> cause particular <b>wear</b> of the rails because of the strongest dynamic effects of the vehicle on the rail. The thesis thus presents the most common surface defects, defines rail wear and outlines currently available techniques of rail grinding and lubrication. In the last few decades, only continuous welded tracks have been consistently installed. To this end, the second chapter describes the procedures and conditions for the construction and welding of rails into continuous welded tracks as provided for in the Rules on railway line superstructure published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 92 / 2010.

The test was performed over a broad range of applied loads (W), sliding velocities (v) and sliding distances (L) using a ball-on-disc tribometer. At higher applied load, sliding speed and sliding distance, it was found that gas blown to the sliding surfaces in air effectively reduced the coefficient of friction as compared to the air lubrication. In addition, based upon the mean of signal-to-noise (SN) ratio analysis, the sliding speed is the most influencing factor for minimizing coefficient of friction. In this study, the optimal design parameters for a lower coefficient of friction (μ) are: lubricant = N 2, W = 10 N, v = 1000 rpm, L = 1 km. By using the optimal design parameters, a confirmation test successfully verified that the N 2 -gas lubrication reduced coefficient of friction by 24 %. This is in accordance with a significant reduction of <b>wear</b> scar <b>diameter</b> and smoother <b>worn</b> surface on the ball...|$|R
