40|$|The Belgian Material Test Reactor (MTR) BR 2 is {{strongly}} heterogeneous high flux engineering test reactor at SCK-CEN (Centre d'Etude de l'energie Nucléaire) in Mol at a thermal power 60 to 100 MW. It deploys highly enriched uranium, water cooled concentric plate fuel elements, positioned inside a beryllium reflector with complex hyperboloid arrangement of test holes. The {{objective of this}} paper is the validation of a MCNP&ORIGEN-S 3 D model for reactivity predictions of the entire BR 2 core during reactor operation. We employ the Monte Carlo code MCNP- 4 C for evaluating the effective multiplication factor keff and 3 D space dependent specific power distribution. The 1 D code ORIGEN-S is used for calculation of <b>isotopic</b> <b>fuel</b> depletion versus burn up and preparation of a database (DB) with depleted fuel compositions. The approach taken is to evaluate the 3 D power distribution at each time step and along with DB to evaluate the 3 D <b>isotopic</b> <b>fuel</b> depletion at the next step and to deduce the corresponding shim rods positions of the reactor operation. The capabilities of the both codes are fully exploited without constraints on the number of involved isotope depletion chains or increase of the computational time. The reactor has a complex operation, with important shutdowns between cycles, and its reactivity {{is strongly}} influenced by poisons, mainly 3 He and 6 Li from the beryllium reflector, and burnable absorbers 149 Sm and 10 B in the fresh UAlx fuel.

We ignore the DD fusion reactions since its reaction rate coefficient is two orders of magnitude lower than the DT reaction rate in the temperature range that ITER will operate. In this ion temperature range (5 – 30 keV) the DT reaction rate coefficient scales roughly as ~Ti 2 / 3, thus the fusion power PDT scales as PDT ~ γ (1 −γ) ni 2 Ti 2 / 3.

40|$|As {{part of the}} International Thermonuclear Engineering Reactor (ITER) plasma fueling {{development}} program, Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has fabricated a pellet (cylindrical projectile {{of frozen}} hydrogenic gas at a temperature in the range 6 [...] 16 K) injection system to test the mechanical and thermal properties of extruded tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. This repeating, single-stage, pneumatic injector, called the Tritium-Proof-of-Principle Phase 2 (TPOP- 2) Pellet Injector, has a piston-driven mechanical extruder and is designed to extrude and accelerate hydrogenic pellets sized for the ITER device. The TPOP- 2 program has the following development goals: evaluate the feasibility of extruding tritium and deuterium-tritium (D-T) mixtures for use in future pellet injection systems; determine the mechanical and thermal properties of tritium and D-T extrusions; integrate, test, and evaluate the extruder in a repeating, single-stage light gas gun that is sized for the ITER application (pellet diameter {approximately} 7 to 8 mm); evaluate options for recycling propellant and extruder exhaust gas; evaluate operability and reliability of ITER prototypical fueling systems {{in an environment of}} significant tritium inventory that requires secondary and room containment systems.

40|$|International audienceDynamic {{fuel cycle}} {{simulation}} codes model evolving nuclear fuel cycles, and calculate nuclides inventories and material flows in each {{unit of the}} cycle. In the nuclear fuel cycle simulation code CLASS (Core Library for Advanced Scenario Simulation), a Fuel Loading Model (FLM) builds a fresh fuel fulfilling the reactor criticality requirement, depending on the available fissile material. Then, a mean cross-sections predictor calculates the mean cross-sections required to perform the fuel depletion in a short calculation time. This work focuses on the elaboration of these models {{in the case of}} a PWR-MOXEUS fuel (MOX on Enriched Uranium Support), which allows plutonium mono-recycling and multi-recycling in PWR. These models are built using neural networks. These predictors are trained on a databank composed of 1000 PWR infinite assembly depletion calculations performed using the software MURE (MCNP Utility for Reactor Evolution) based on the transport code MCNP (Monte-Carlo N Particle). Several databanks are tested and the performance of the resulting predictors are compared. The FLM predicts the plutonium content, and potentially the uranium enrichment, required in the fresh fuel. This model is based on a calculation of the infinite multiplication factor performed with an accuracy close to MCNP statistical error. Mean cross-sections prediction allows a deviation lower than 5 % on main plutonium isotopes at 75 GWd/t compared to the fuel depletion reference calculation. PWR MOXEUS models are also tested on a balancing scenario. The complex evolution of MOXEUS fresh <b>fuel</b> <b>isotopic</b> composition during the scenario is highlighted.

Since nowadays higher burn ups are achievable through increasing initial enrichments, more efficient burn up strategies within the reactor cores and the extension of the irradiation periods, establishing and improving computation methodologies is mandatory in order to carry out reliable criticality and isotopic prediction calculations. Several codes (WIMSD 5, SERPENT 1. 1. 7, SCALE 6. 0, MONTEBURNS 2. 0 and MCNP-ACAB) and methodologies are tested here and compared to consolidated benchmarks (OECD/NEA pin cell moderated with light water) with the purpose of validating them and reviewing the state of the isotopic prediction capabilities. These preliminary comparisons will suggest what can be generally expected of these codes when applied to real problems.

During testing, the physical and mechanical stability of the rolled membranes have been observed and high hydrogen fluxes have been measured. The long-term tests have also shown the modification of the surface structure of the membrane due to the hydrogen-metal interaction and the thermal cycling: as a consequence, an increase of the mass transfer properties of the hydrogen through the material (diffusivity and solubility) has been observed and the membrane tube has attained very high performances in about 3 months of operation in terms of hydrogen permeability. Furthermore, the tests have demonstrated that these Pd-Ag membranes {{have the capability to}} separate hydrogen from gas mixtures with a complete hydrogen selectivity and can be used to produce ultra-pure hydrogen for applications in energetic fields in membrane reactors by molecular reforming in membrane reactors (i. e. <b>isotopic</b> hydrogen separation, <b>fuel</b> cell, etc.).

40|$|For {{modeling}} the <b>isotopic</b> composition of <b>fuel,</b> and maximum temperatures at different moments of time, {{one can use}} different algorithms and codes. In connection {{with the development of}} new types of fuel assemblies and progress in computer technology, the task makes important to increase accuracy in modeling of the above characteristics of fuel assemblies during the operation. Calculations of neutronphysical characteristics of fuel rods are mainly based on models using averaged temperature, thermal conductivity factors, and heat power density. In this paper, complex approach is presented, based on modern algorithms, methods and codes to solve separate tasks of thermal conductivity, neutron transport, and nuclide transformation kinetics. It allows to perform neutron-physical and thermal-physical calculation of the reactor with detailed temperature distribution, with account of temperature-depending thermal conductivity and other characteristics. It was applied to studies of fuel cell of the VVER- 1000 reactor. When developing new algorithms and programs, which should improve the accuracy of {{modeling the}} isotopic composition and maximum temperature in the fuel rod, it is necessary to have a set of test tasks for verification. The proposed approach can be used for development of such verification base for testing calculation of fuel rods of VVER type reactor...|$|R
