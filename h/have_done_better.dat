5|$|Upon {{release in}} Japan, the game entered {{the top ten}} best-selling titles of the week at #3, with 21,445 units sold. It had a {{sell-through}} rate of just over 48%. The following week, it had dropped to #8, selling a further 8,436 units. By {{the end of the}} year, it was among the top 1000 best-selling games of 2011, with total sales of 46,834 units. At its debut in the United Kingdom, it performed poorly, reaching only #38 in the charts. According to Xseed, the game's sales in North America were favorable, although they were not on the same level as The Last Story. In an interview, Xseed said that it might <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>better</b> if it had been released in the 2012 holiday season.|$|E

25|$|After {{the loss}} of Kaiserslautern, the Army of the Moselle withdrew to the Saar while the Army of the Rhine retreated behind the Queich River to Landau. Möllendorf would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>better</b> by {{following}} Jourdan to the north. His minor victory at Kaiserslautern was greatly overmatched by Jourdan's decisive triumph at the Battle of Fleurus. Möllendorf's offensive quickly {{ground to a halt}} and the Prussians set about building a series of armed camps to hold their newly captured territory. The next action in the theater occurred on 12 and 13 July in the Battle of the Vosges or Schänzel. After this victory, the French recaptured Kaiserslautern on 17 July and moved forward to the Speyerbach again, wiping out all of the Coalition's recent gains.|$|E
5000|$|More than 67 million Americans {{watched the}} debate, {{making it the}} most widely viewed first presidential debate in 32 years. A CBS poll of {{uncommitted}} voters found that 46% thought that Romney <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>better,</b> 22% thought Obama <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>better,</b> and 32% {{thought that it was}} a tie. A CNN poll found a greater advantage for Romney among debate watchers overall, with 67% believing the former Massachusetts governor <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>better,</b> 25% believing that the president <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>better,</b> and 8% believing that it was a tie. A Gallup poll found that 72% of the debate watchers believed Romney was the clear winner, 20% believed that Obama had won, and 9% believed it was a tie or had no opinion; the widest margin of victory for any presidential debate in Gallup history. Time Magazines Joe Klein stated, [...] "It was, in fact, one of the most inept performances I’ve ever seen by a sitting President." ...|$|R

25|$|During {{his time}} at the college, Woods {{developed}} a slower ball after watching George Lohmann bowling against Sussex. Woods claimed that after practising the delivery for hours, he took a wicket with the first one he ever bowled, dismissing GG Hearne caught and bowled in a match against the Marylebone Cricket Club and Ground. Woods left Brighton College in 1886, aged 19, and shortly after, in August of the same year, he made his first-class cricket debut. Playing for GN Wyatt's XI against the touring Australians, Woods opened the bowling in both innings for the English side which was termed a 'South of England XI'. Woods made scores of 21 and 11 with the bat, and took 2/45 and 0/40 bowling. He claimed that he strained his side trying to bowl too fast, and would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>better</b> otherwise.|$|E
25|$|Nationwide, the RealClearPolitics tally counted one caucus {{participant}} {{as equal}} to one primary participant. However, turnout is generally lower in caucuses, {{and as a}} result, the popular vote may overweight the influence of primary states. For example, Hawaii and Rhode Island have similar populations, but the opinion of Rhode Islanders is weighted more heavily in the popular vote total. Clinton won the Rhode Island primary 58-40% and received 33,600 more votes than Obama. In contrast, Obama won the Hawaii caucuses 76-24%, but received only 19,500 more votes than Clinton. Thus, some researchers argue that the popular vote underestimates the depth of Obama's support in caucus states. If these states were to hold primaries and Obama were to win by a similar margin, his popular vote total would be considerably higher. However, Clinton argued that she would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>better</b> in these states if primaries were held.|$|E
25|$|While {{both were}} important, Sasun Eff was {{absolutely}} essential. His refusal would damn the Cabinet as a Talib ministry and doom it to failure from the outset. I left my {{cup of tea}} undrunk and rushed {{back to the office}} to tell Mr Philby. He wasn't there, but there was a light in Sir Percy's room. I went in and told him. He bade me go at once to Sasun Eff and charged me to make him change his mind. I set off feeling as if I carried the future of the 'Iraq in my hands, but when I got to Sasun's house to my immense relief I found Mr Philby and Capt Clayton already there. The Naqib had got Sasun's letter and had sent Mr Philby off post haste. I arrived, however, in the nick of time. They had exhausted all their arguments and Sasun still adhered to his decision. I think my immense anxiety must have inspired me for after an hour of concentrated argument he was visibly shaken, {{in spite of the fact}} that his brother Sha'al (whom I also admire and respect) came in and did his best against us. Finally however we persuaded him that Sir Percy had no desire to thrust Talib or anyone else upon Mesopotamia, but that Talib like everyone else must be given his chance. If he proved valuable he would take his part in the foundation of national institutions, if not he was politically a dead man. We got Sasun Eff to consent to think it over and to come and see Sir Percy next day. I had an inner conviction that the game was won—partly, thank heaven, to the relations of trust and confidence which I personally had already established with Sasun—but we none of us could feel sure. You will readily understand that I didn't sleep much that night. I turned and turned in my mind the arguments I had used and wondered if I could not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>better.</b>|$|E

500|$|Negative reviews {{revolved}} around the theme's classic Bond sound. LAUNCHcast's James Poletti called the song a [...] "perfectly competent Bond theme", but [...] "the formula seems a little too easy. Perhaps they would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>better</b> {{to rise to the}} challenge of doing something a little different, something a little more knowingly tongue-in-cheek." [...] Melody Maker stated, [...] "You know what this sounds like before you hear it. If the people in charge want Garbage, then why not let them do what Garbage do?" [...] In its review of Absolute Garbage, Pitchfork called the song a [...] "predictable 'Goldfinger' permutation signaling the band's limitless affinity for big-budget theatrics." ...|$|E
500|$|Verdi {{received}} the draft libretto {{a few weeks}} later, by early July 1889, {{at a time when}} his interest had been piqued by reading Shakespeare's play: [...] "Benissimo! Benissimo!... No one could <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>better</b> than you", he wrote back. Like Boito, Verdi loved and revered Shakespeare. The composer did not speak English, but he owned and frequently re-read Shakespeare's plays in Italian translations by Carlo Rusconi and Giulio Carcano, which he kept by his bedside. He had earlier set operatic adaptations of Shakespeare's Macbeth (in 1847) and Othello (in 1887) and had considered King Lear as a subject; Boito had suggested Antony and Cleopatra.|$|E

While Ocasek and Orr split vocal duties on past albums, Ocasek sings lead on all the tracks from Move Like This. In a Rolling Stone interview, Ocasek said, [...] "I was aware that on half of the new songs, Ben would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>better</b> than I did. But we never wanted anybody from the outside."

500|$|William Plomer, {{writing in}} The Spectator after the book's first publication, thought it mistaken [...] "to regard Mr Waugh's more {{surprising}} situations as farcical or far-fetched; {{they are on}} the whole extremely realistic". However, the mixture of genres was not immediately understood or appreciated by some of Waugh's admirers; Connolly's initial thought was that Waugh had been [...] "destroyed as a writer", by snobbery and association with country-house living. In Sykes's view, the fleeting appearances in the book of characters from Waugh's farcical world, such as Lady Metroland, are awkward and intrusive—the world of A Handful of Dust is not outlandish: [...] "Evelyn would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>better</b> to have forgotten Lady Metroland and her world altogether".|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{favorable}} reviews and good chart {{position of the}} lead single, 1000 Fires did not achieve mainstream success. Lords later commented: [...] "The problem with that album {{was that it was}} ahead of its time. Electronica was just starting to happen. Moby was just starting to be huge. I opened for Thrill Kill Kult and Moby as a DJ back then. The masses didn't know who Moby was. I think if it had been slightly delayed it would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>better.</b> Madonna had it right to wait for Ray of Light. She has been a lot better with her timing than me. I am proud of that album because I hear it now and it still feels current. It doesn't feel dated." ...|$|E
500|$|On his deposition, a Sydney Morning Herald {{editorial}} {{summed up}} his leadership thus: [...] "True, the margin [...] was slender. And, true, Morton campaigned vigorously. But his punches {{seemed to be}} rather wild. He would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>better</b> by directing his blows to a few vital points {{instead of trying to}} hit at anything in sight. In addition to losing the last election, when Labour seemed at its most vulnerable after 18 years of office, Mr Morton further disappointed his colleagues – indeed, antagonised some of them – by expanding his private business interests when he was being urged to concentrate wholly on the job of Leader of the Opposition. However, the sad truth is that the genial Mr Morton has never measured up as a sagacious, inspiring leader." ...|$|E

A Reuters poll indicated Biden the superior candidate, 42% to 35% with 23% undecided or believing they tied. [...] A CNN poll of debate watchers found that 48% of viewers believed Ryan <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>better,</b> 44% believed Biden <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>better,</b> and 8% believed they tied or had no opinion; CNN {{noted that the}} debate audience polled was about eight percentage points more Republican than the general population. [...] Nate Silver's analysis of polling after the debate led to his concluding that, though both debaters performed adequately, Biden's performance helped to slow {{the momentum of the}} Romney campaign following the first presidential debate.|$|R
500|$|The film also {{attracted}} criticism. UK Anime Network's Andy Hanley stated [...] "It has potential in its characters and concept, but does very little with {{them over the}} course of this film to make for a disappointly mediocre movie." [...] Similar to Silverman, Jeffrey Kauffman from Blu-ray.com noted that the film had a slow pace in developing Yuri and Flynn's relationship. He gave high praise to the animation used in the story. He criticized its supporting cast as he believes [...] "Tales of Vesperia: The First Strike is a standalone offering, or at least one that might <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>better</b> had it focused solely on Yuri and Flynn and left the rest of the 'cast of thousands' far in the background." [...] Gay was saddened by the lack of appearances from the side characters such as Siren, Hisca, and Chastel.|$|E
500|$|Numismatist David Bullowa, in {{his early}} work on commemoratives, stated, [...] "the design of this issue is pleasing... the obverse and reverse alike are sharply defined, {{interesting}} and not crowded". Art historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his work on U.S. coins and medals, wrote that the half dollar [...] "manages to combine most of the faults found in the better designs of the 1920's and 1930's." [...] After complaining about the flat design and {{the large amount of}} lettering on both sides, Vermeule critiqued, [...] "the bust of Moses Cleaveland {{can only be described as}} commonplace, and the view of the Great Lakes, bisected by a large compass, is nothing short of incomprehensible." [...] Nevertheless, Vermeule suggested that Putnam did the best she could to squeeze the required text onto a half dollar, and might <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>better</b> with fewer words to place.|$|E
500|$|Wizards & Warriors III {{received}} {{praise from}} Retro Gamer magazine in September2010, {{as part of}} its retrospective on the Wizards & Warriors series. They said that the third installment was the best game in the series as well as developer Ste Pickford's personal favorite, {{despite the fact that it}} did not sell as well as its predecessor Ironsword. Developer Ste Pickford said: [...] "Wizards & WarriorsIII was more like a game that I really wanted to make. IronSword was pretty much a straight sequel for a game dropped in our lap; we look at it and tried to make a new version with some improvements." [...] Pickford added that, while he could <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>better</b> with both Ironsword and Wizards & WarriorsIII, he wished he would have been able to see the latter to its completion.|$|E
50|$|A CNN poll {{of debate}} watchers found that 46% of {{respondents}} believed that Obama <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>better,</b> 39% believed that Romney <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>better,</b> and 11% <b>had</b> no opinion or believed they tied; CNN {{noted that the}} debate audience polled was about eight percentage points more Republican than the general population, similar to the Vice Presidential debate. A CBS poll of uncommitted voters found that 37% believed Obama was superior in the second debate, 30% said that Romney was superior, and 33% called the debate a tie. 55% of the voters CBS polled said that Obama gave direct answers, while 49% said this about Romney.|$|R

Normally, he would break some of those runs. I don't think he quite had his third gear today." [...] Steffy played a solid first half, but in the second, threw two interceptions before {{suffering}} a season-ending thumb fracture. He was replaced by back-up Chris Turner who started {{for the remainder of}} the season. Regarding their loss, Delaware head coach K.C. Keeler said, [...] "This is not like a moral victory. I don't believe in moral victories... This was not a payday for us... We play a home game, we make more money than playing this game down here. When we scheduled this game, I thought our program would possibly be in a position to beat a solid ACC school." ...|$|E
500|$|Paranhos {{was left}} behind when Carneiro Leão {{returned}} to Brazil, having been named Brazil's diplomatic minister to Uruguay. Paranhos' time in Uruguay allowed him to acquire {{an understanding of the}} dynamics characterizing Hispanic American nations of the period. Intermittent crises leading to and resulting from coups, government by dictators, political factionalism and civil wars were commonplace among these countries. A penchant for, and skill in, diplomacy became evident during his stay—as a pleased Viscount of Uruguai, still Minister of Foreign Affairs, noted in February 1853: [...] "In a general manner, I approve of what our diplomatic representatives do; however, it almost always seems to me that, were I in their places, I would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>better.</b> But with Dr. Paranhos that thought does not occur to me. Every time I read his communiqués, I tell myself: 'This is precisely what I would have done or said.'" ...|$|E
500|$|A soldier {{under the}} command of Colonel Garnons Williams wrote an account of his {{commanding}} officer's death, which puts the date of his death as 27 September. Col Garnons Williams was in temporary command of the 12th Royal Fusiliers when on 25 September he led his battalion in an attack on German trenches. However, the flanks were exposed and on 27 September, Garnons Williams gave the order to retreat. He was at that moment shot in the head from a house nearby. The soldier who gave the account said: [...] "I was very sorry for him, as we could not have had a better, braver officer. He was with us {{all the time in the}} front trench, and looked after us as well as he could; no man could <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>better.</b> Nobody could get back to him." [...] The following evening, the battalion was relieved, Garnons Williams being declared officially wounded and missing in action, unofficially reported killed.|$|E
