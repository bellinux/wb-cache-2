5000|$|On December 8, 2014 the Oklahoma City School Board voted {{unanimously}} to remove Redskins as the nickname for Capitol Hill High School. The vote came in response to pleas from students and teachers who found the term offensive. The following day some students {{of the high school}} upset by the change protested the school board decision. On January 6, 2015, the school board held an <b>information</b> <b>forum</b> at which a panel of Native American community leaders presented the reasons for the decision, including the derogatory nature of the term. Some members of the audience walked out during the presentation, and one alumni called the presentation [...] "propaganda" [...] and asserted his opposition to changing the name. Another alumni stated that if any Native Americans did not like the name Redskins they should go to a native school. A committee has selected four possible replacements, including Red Hawks, Red Wolves, War Eagles and Nations, with the final decision to be made by a vote of Capitol Hill Students. Names such as Chieftains and Warriors, although favored by alumni on the committee, were not selected as continuing the linkage to Native Americans. In a vote by students in May, 2015, Red Wolves was selected as the new mascot.|$|E

40|$|Objective : To {{describe}} {{role and}} involvement of Life End <b>Information</b> <b>Forum</b> (LEIF) physicians in end-of-life care decisions and euthanasia in Flanders. Study Design : All 132 LEIF physicians in Belgium received a questionnaire inquiring about their {{activities in the}} past year, and their end-of-life care training and experience. Principal Findings : Response rate was 75 percent. Most respondents followed substantive training in end-of-life care. In 1 year, LEIF physicians were contacted 612 times for consultations in end-of-life decisions, of which 355 concerned euthanasia requests eventually resulting in 221 euthanasia cases. LEIF physicians also gave information about various end-of-life issues (including palliative care) to patients and colleagues. Conclusions : LEIF physicians provide a forum for information and advice for physicians and patients. A similar health service providing support to physicians for all end-of-life decisions could also be beneficial for countries without a euthanasia law...|$|E
40|$|In 2000, crystal methamphetamine made an {{appearance}} in the Prince George hospital detox unit and drug busts however, the first public warning via a provincially sponsored <b>information</b> <b>forum</b> did not occur until early 2006. This retrospective case study uses documentary evidence and interviews, to examine the who, how, and why of the information about crystal methamphetamine that is provided {{to the public in}} Prince George. A timeline of media accounts reveals an increase in language designed to stimulate public concern about crystal methamphetamine and increase public trust for the provincial government. Horizontal disconnection between community agencies in terms of role recognition (internal recognition of an agency mandate) and role perception (external perception of agency mandate) seems to increase difficulties in strategic planning and formulation of a shared vision for the community.

(2015) provided undergraduate students with two conflicting written health information claims about cholesterol. Depending on the experimental group, {{one of the two}} conflicting claims cited scientific studies that allegedly supported the claim, and the other claim lacked such references.
