40|$|An {{investigation}} was initiated {{to determine the}} cause of coating spallation occurring on the Shuttle Orbiter's wing leading edge panels in the slip-side <b>joggle</b> region. The coating spallation events were observed, post flight, on differing panels on different missions. As part of the investigation, the high re-entry heating occurring on the <b>joggles</b> was considered here as a possible cause. Thus, a thermostructural evaluation was conducted to determine the detailed state-of-stress in the <b>joggle</b> region during re-entry and the feasibility of a laboratory test on a local <b>joggle</b> specimen to replicate this state-of-stress. A detailed three-dimensional finite element model of a panel slip-side <b>joggle</b> region was developed. Parametric and sensitivity studies revealed significant stresses occur in the <b>joggle</b> during peak heating. A critical interlaminar normal stress concentration was predicted in the substrate at the coating interface and was confined to the curved <b>joggle</b> region. Specifically, the high interlaminar normal stress is identified to be the cause for the occurrence of failure in the form of local subsurface material separation occurring in the slip-side <b>joggle.</b> The predicted critical stresses are coincident with material separations that had been observed with microscopy in <b>joggle</b> specimens obtained from flight panels...|$|R

40|$|Linear elastic, thermo-mechanical stress {{analyses}} of the Space Shuttle Orbiter wing-leading-edge panels is presented for entry heating conditions. The wing-leading-edge panels are made from reinforced carbon-carbon {{and serve as a}} part of the overall thermal protection system. Three-dimensional finite element models are described for three configurations: integrated configuration, an independent single-panel configuration, and a local lower-apex <b>joggle</b> segment. Entry temperature conditions are imposed and the through-the-thickness response is examined. From the integrated model, it was concluded that individual panels can be analyzed independently since minimal interaction between adjacent components occurred. From the independent single-panel model, it was concluded that increased through-the-thickness stress levels developed all along the chord of a panel s slip-side <b>joggle</b> region, and hence isolated local <b>joggle</b> sections will exhibit the same trend. From the local <b>joggle</b> models, it was concluded that two-dimensional plane-strain models can be used to study the influence of subsurface defects along the slip-side <b>joggle</b> region of these panels...|$|R

60|$|While I {{was thus}} desperately tacking through the bog, {{children}} and cattle began to disperse, until only {{a pair of}} girls remained behind. From these I sought direction on my path. The peasantry in general were but little disposed to counsel a wayfarer. One old devil simply retired into his house, and barricaded the door on my approach; and I might beat and shout myself hoarse, he turned a deaf ear. Another, having given me a direction which, as I found afterwards, I had misunderstood, complacently watched me going wrong without adding a sign. He did not care a stalk of parsley if I wandered all night upon the hills! As for these two girls, they were a pair of impudent sly sluts, with not a thought but mischief. One put out her tongue at me, the other bade me follow the cows, and they both giggled and <b>joggled</b> each other's elbows.

All the time the first witnesses was proving the bad blood and the threats and all that, Tom Sawyer was alive and laying for them; and the minute they was through, he went for them, and done his level best to catch them in lies and spile their testimony. But now, how different. When Lem first begun to talk, and never said anything about speaking to Jubiter or trying to borrow a dog off of him, he was all alive and laying for Lem, {{and you could see}} he was getting ready to cross-question him to death pretty soon, and then I judged him and me would go on the stand by and by and tell what we heard him and Jim Lane say. But the next time I looked at Tom I got the cold shivers. Why, he was in the brownest study you ever see--miles and miles away. He warn't hearing a word Lem Beebe was saying; and when he got through he was still in that brown-study, just the same. Our lawyer <b>joggled</b> him, and then he looked up startled, and says, [...] "Take the witness if you want him. Lemme alone--I want to think." ...|$|E

Then Mrs. Eddy does not keep still, but fetches around and comes forward and testifies again. It is most injudicious. For she resorts to metaphor this time, and it makes trouble, for she seems to reverse the percentages and claim only the eight per cent. for her self.

60|$|Smeaton was, indeed, {{the patron}} saint of the Bell Rock. Undeterred by the {{sinister}} fate of Winstanley, he had tackled and solved the problem of the Eddystone; but his solution had not been in all respects perfect. It remained for my grand-father to outdo him in daring, by applying to a tidal rock those principles which had been already justified by the success of the Eddystone, and to perfect the model by more than one exemplary departure. Smeaton had adopted in his floors the principle of the arch; each therefore exercised an outward thrust upon the walls, which must be met and combated by embedded chains. My grandfather’s flooring-stones, on the other hand, were flat, made part of the outer wall, and were keyed and dovetailed into a central stone, so as to bind the work together and be positive elements of strength. In 1703 Winstanley still thought it possible to erect his strange pagoda, with its open gallery, its florid scrolls and candlesticks: like a rich man’s folly for an ornamental water in a park. Smeaton followed; then Stevenson in his turn corrected such flaws as were left in Smeaton’s design; and with his improvements, it is not too much to say the model was made perfect. Smeaton and Stevenson had between them evolved and finished the sea-tower. No subsequent builder has departed in anything essential from the principles of their design. It remains, and it seems to us as though it must remain for ever, an ideal attained. Every stone in the building, it may interest the reader to know, my grandfather had himself cut out in the model; {{and the manner in which}} the courses were fitted, <b>joggled,</b> trenailed, wedged, and the bond broken, is intricate as a puzzle and beautiful by ingenuity.|$|E

50|$|<b>Joggling</b> was {{conceived}} by Bill Giduz in 1975. The first official <b>joggling</b> event {{took place at}} the 1981 International Jugglers' Association festival in North Dakota. The sport has two primary rules: a runner must juggle at least three objects every step of the way, and if the object drops, the runner must pick it up and continue running from the point where the drop occurred. Kapral first learned of <b>joggling</b> at the age of 11, when he saw the world record listed in The Guinness Book of World Records, and started running after graduating from college. He completed his first marathon in 1999, and in 2002 won the Toronto Marathon with a time of 2:30:40, his best overall marathon time. Earlier that year, he was the top Canadian finisher at the Boston Marathon.|$|R
