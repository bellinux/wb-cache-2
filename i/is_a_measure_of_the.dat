5|$|Climate <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{long-term}} {{trends in}} the weather. Various factors are known to influence the climate, including ocean currents, surface albedo, greenhouse gases, variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the Earth's orbit. Based on historical records, the Earth {{is known to have}} undergone drastic climate changes in the past, including ice ages.|$|E
5|$|The {{nominal volume}} of gas stored is {{commonly}} quoted as the cylinder {{capacity in the}} USA. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> volume of gas that can be released from the full cylinder at atmospheric pressure. Terms used for the capacity include 'free gas volume' or 'free gas equivalent'. It depends on the internal volume and the working pressure of a cylinder. If the working pressure is higher, the cylinder will store more gas for the same volume.|$|E
5|$|The season's {{activity}} was reflected with a cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 121. ACE, broadly speaking, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{power of the}} hurricane multiplied by {{the length of time}} it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high values. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34knots (39mph, 63km/h) or tropical storm strength.|$|E
50|$|In addition, the {{parameters}} qE, and pNPQ {{have been developed}} to measure the photoprotective xanthophyll cycle. qT <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> state transitions. qM <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> chloroplast migration, and qI <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> plant photoinhibition.|$|R

50|$|Operating {{leverage}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> how {{revenue growth}} translates into growth in operating income. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> leverage, {{and of how}} risky, or volatile, a company's operating income is.|$|R
5|$|Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{activity}} {{of a hurricane}} season. It is calculated by squaring the windspeed of a cyclone with at least tropical storm-force winds every six hours, summing the results, and dividing that total by 104. As a tropical cyclone does not have gale-force winds until it becomes a tropical storm, tropical depressions {{are not included in}} these tables. For all storms, ACE is given to three significant figures. The ACE in the east Pacific proper (140°W to North America) is given; the ACE in the central Pacific (the International Date Line to 140°W) is given in parentheses.|$|E
5|$|Temperature <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{kinetic energy}} of a sample of matter. Temperature is the unique {{physical}} property that determines the direction of heat flow between two objects placed in thermal contact. If no heat flow occurs, the two objects have the same temperature; otherwise heat flows from the hotter object to the colder object. Temperature, within meteorology, is measured with thermometers exposed to the air but sheltered from direct solar exposure. In most of the world, the degree Celsius scale is used for most temperature measuring purposes. However, the United States is the last major country in which the degree Fahrenheit temperature scale is used by most lay people, industry, popular meteorology, and government. Despite this, METAR reports from the United States also report the temperature (and dewpoint, see below) in degrees Celsius.|$|E
5|$|The {{route is}} {{maintained}} by the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT), {{who is responsible for}} maintaining and constructing transportation infrastructure in Colorado, including highways. As part of this role, CDOT periodically conducts surveys on their highways to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> average daily traffic volume on a particular road. In 2009, CDOT calculated that as few as 3,200 vehicles used SH74 daily near Idledale, and as many as 23,000 vehicles used SH74 near the interchange with I-70 as well in Evergreen.|$|E
40|$|Three {{integrity}} {{measures are}} introduced: contamination, channel suppression, and program suppression. Contamination <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> how much untrusted information reaches trusted outputs; {{it is the}} dual <b>of</b> leakage, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> information-flow confidentiality. Channel suppression <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> how much information about inputs to <b>a</b> noisy channel <b>is</b> missing from channel outputs. And program suppression <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> how much information about the correct output of <b>a</b> program <b>is</b> lost because of attacker influence and implementation errors. Program and channel suppression do not have confidentiality duals. As a case study, the relationship between quantitative integrity, confidentiality, and database privacy is examined. 1...|$|R
50|$|Length may be {{distinguished}} from height, which is vertical extent, and width or breadth, which are the distance from side to side, measuring across the object {{at right angles to}} the length. Length <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> one dimension, whereas area <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> two dimensions (length squared) and volume <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> three dimensions (length cubed). In most systems of measurement, the unit of length <b>is</b> <b>a</b> base unit, from which other units are derived.|$|R
50|$|In scheduling, {{tardiness}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{delay in}} executing certain operations and earliness <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> finishing operations before due time. The operations {{may depend on}} each other and {{on the availability of}} equipment to perform them.|$|R
5|$|The season's {{activity}} was reflected with an ACE rating of approximately 165 units, the highest since 2005, and the eleventh highest value since 1944 at the time. Broadly speaking, ACE <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{power of a}} tropical or subtropical storm multiplied by {{the length of time}} it existed. Therefore, a storm with a longer duration, such as Igor, will have high values of ACE. It is only calculated for full advisories on specific tropical and subtropical systems reaching or exceeding wind speeds of 39mph (63km/h). Accordingly, tropical depressions are not included in the count. After the storm has dissipated, typically {{after the end of the}} season, the NHC re-examines the data and produces a final report on each storm. These revisions can lead to a revised ACE total either upward or downward compared to the original value.|$|E
5|$|Atoms lack a {{well-defined}} outer boundary, so their dimensions are usually {{described in terms}} of an atomic radius. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> distance out to which the electron cloud extends from the nucleus. However, this assumes the atom to exhibit a spherical shape, which is only obeyed for atoms in vacuum or free space. Atomic radii may be derived from the distances between two nuclei when the two atoms are joined in a chemical bond. The radius varies with the location of an atom on the atomic chart, the type of chemical bond, the number of neighboring atoms (coordination number) and a quantum mechanical property known as spin. On the periodic table of the elements, atom size tends to increase when moving down columns, but decrease when moving across rows (left to right). Consequently, the smallest atom is helium with a radius of 32pm, while one of the largest is caesium at 225pm.|$|E
5|$|M-75 {{begins in}} {{downtown}} Boyne Falls at an intersection with US 131. It follows Mill Street northwesterly out of town, passing {{to the north}} of a lake and the Boyne Mountain Airport. The airport property ends at the intersection with C-48 west of Boyne Falls. M-75 runs parallel to the Boyne River until it turns west near the Boyne City Municipal Airport to enter the community of Boyne City on East Division Street. Two blocks further west, it meets C-73/East Jordan Road next to the Maple Lawn Cemetery. Next to the cemetery, the highway follows Boyne Avenue northwesterly into downtown. The trunkline turns north on East Street to cross the Boyne River and then turns east on State Street passing Rotary Park {{on the way out of}} town. The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) measures the average annual daily traffic (AADT) in traffic surveys. AADT <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> average traffic levels for a section of roadway on any given day of the year. The southern segment of M-75 carried 6,500vehicles daily in the 2007 survey. Of these vehicles, commercial traffic was measured at 280trucks.|$|E
50|$|Cumulative {{incidence}} or {{incidence proportion}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> frequency, as in epidemiology, where it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>measure</b> <b>of</b> disease frequency {{during a period}} of time.
