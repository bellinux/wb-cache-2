50|$|Vocal <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> a {{quantity}} varied by speakers when adjusting {{to an increase}} or decrease in the communication distance. The communication distance is {{the distance between the}} speaker and the listener. Vocal <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> a subjective physiological quantity, and is mainly dependent on subglottal pressure, vocal fold tension and jaw opening. Vocal <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> different from sound pressure. To measure vocal <b>effort,</b> listeners <b>are</b> asked to rate the distance between speaker and addressee.|$|R
5|$|The {{development}} of Nazi propaganda in occupied Poland {{can be divided}} into two main phases.

5|$|Il-6 – bomber with M-90 engines - {{projected}} variant with M-90 engines, production drawings {{were issued}} but nothing further was heard of it, presumably as all <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> {{focused on the}} diesel-powered version.|$|E
5|$|One last Allied <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> made by 70 B-24 Liberators, which bombed airfields around Bari in Italy. Some 54 German {{aircraft}} {{were destroyed}} and 13 damaged on the ground. The USAAF units claimed 50.|$|E

30|$|Minimum {{pneumatic}} braking: in this region, {{the electric}} braking <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> {{limited to a}} maximum value, often related to the motor currents. If a higher braking <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> required, then the pneumatic brake is activated to supply the difference.|$|R

5|$|Vandegrift {{ordered the}} {{withdrawal}} {{because of the}} receipt of intelligence from coastwatchers, aerial reconnaissance, and radio intercepts that a major Japanese reinforcement <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> imminent. Indeed, the Japanese {{were in the process}} of attempting to deliver the 10,000 remaining troops from the 38th Division to Guadalcanal in order to reattempt to capture Henderson Field. The resulting efforts by the Americans to stop this reinforcement attempt resulted in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, the decisive naval battle of the Guadalcanal campaign, in which the Japanese reinforcement <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> turned back.|$|E
5|$|Work {{started on}} the Cray-3 in 1988 at Cray Research's (CRI) {{development}} labs in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. Other teams at the lab were working on designs with similar performance. To focus the teams, the Cray-3 <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> {{moved to a new}} lab in Colorado Springs, Colorado later that year. Shortly thereafter, the corporate headquarters in Minneapolis decided to end work on the Cray-3 in favor of another design, the Cray C90. In 1989 the Cray-3 <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> spun off to a newly formed company, Cray Computer Corporation (CCC).|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Battle of France and the {{evacuation}} of British troops from Dunkirk during Operation Dynamo, much of Britain's war production and <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> channeled into RAF Bomber Command and the strategic bombing offensive against Germany. However, bomber losses on each raid began to increase during 1941, which British intelligence concluded was due to German use of advanced radar equipment.|$|E

40|$|Objectives {{were listed}} for four areas: {{engineering}} science, reliability physics, module development, and module performance and failure analysis. The engineering science <b>efforts</b> <b>are</b> to develop module design requirements for large-scale photovoltaic (PV) applications {{and to develop}} generic module and array design and construction technology to meet the needed performance, safety, reliability, and system interfaces. The reliability physics <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> to develop the technology for 30 -year life modules. The module development <b>efforts</b> <b>are</b> to transfer new technology to PV manufacturers and their products, and to evaluate these advanced modules. The module performance and failure analysis <b>efforts</b> <b>are</b> to determine PV module performance, to identify needed development, and to assess suitability for large-scale use...|$|R
5|$|An {{aggressive}} 113 for Fitzroy against Melbourne Cricket Club in 1946–47 saw Harvey {{selected for}} the Victorian team {{at the age of}} 18. He made 18 in his only innings during his first-class debut against Tasmania. In the next match against Tasmania, Harvey made his maiden first-class century, scoring 154. He said that his <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> inspired by elder brother Merv, who gained Test selection in the same year.|$|E
5|$|Away {{from the}} tumult of Bodyline, McCabe played {{in five of}} New South Wales' six Sheffield Shield matches, and he scored 348 runs at 49.71 with four fifties and took 11 wickets at 17.54.

His most {{prominent}} <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> a 91 and a match total of 5/41 in an innings win over Queensland.|$|E
5|$|By August 3, Colonel Warren {{concluded}} the entire <b>effort</b> <b>was</b> futile and dangerous. The unprotected sailors were stirring up radioactive material and contaminating their skin, clothing, and, presumably, their lungs.

Warren demanded an immediate halt to the entire cleanup operation. He was especially concerned about plutonium, which was undetectable on site.|$|E

40|$|By definition, giving 100 % effort all of {{the time}} is sustainable, but begs the {{question}} of how to define 100 % effort. As a corollary, once a benchmark for defining 100 % <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> chosen, it may be possible, even optimal, to give a greater amount of effort for a short period of time, while recognizing that this level of <b>effort</b> <b>is</b> not sustainable. This dynamic <b>effort</b> provision problem <b>is</b> analyzed in the context of effort and performance by National Basketball Association (NBA) players over the course of a season. Within this context, several benchmarks for sustainable <b>effort</b> <b>are</b> considered, but these are rejected by the data.

Strong reinforcements to the Allied antisubmarine forces were desperately needed to avert defeat and needed at once. In response to a request from the Royal Navy for the service of American antisubmarine warfare ships in European waters, the United States Navy began sending destroyers eastward across the Atlantic.|$|E
