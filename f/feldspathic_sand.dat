40|$|Abstract The rice {{industry}} generates {{huge amounts}} of rice straw ashes (RSA). This paper {{presents the results of}} an experimental research work about the incorporation of RSA waste as a new alternative raw material for production of porcelain tiles. The RSA replaces, partially or completely, the non-plastic raw materials (quartz (<b>feldspathic</b> <b>sand</b> in this research) and feldspar), that together with the clays, constitute the major constituents of formulations of porcelain tiles. A standard industrial composition (0 % RSA) and two more compositions in which feldspar and <b>feldspathic</b> <b>sand</b> were replaced with two percentages of RSA (12. 5 % RSA and 60 % RSA) were formulated, keeping the clay content constant. The mixtures were processed, reproducing industrial porcelain tile manufacturing conditions by the dry route and fired at peak temperatures varying from 1140 - 1260 ºC. The results showed that additions of 12. 5 % RSA in replacement of feldspar and <b>feldspathic</b> <b>sand</b> allowed producing porcelain tiles that did not display marked changes in processing behaviour, in addition to obtain a microstructure and the typical mineralogical phases of porcelain tile. Thus, an alternative use of an agricultural waste material is proposed, which can be translated into economic and environmental benefits...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to determine the influence of certain variables (e. g., collector addition, pulp dilution, conditioning times, pH and pulp agitation speed) on the yield for feldspar sand flotation aimed at separating quartz from feldspar and to estimate the values that provide an optimum yield. The <b>feldspathic</b> <b>sands</b> were obtained from a sedimentary deposit located in the Sarreaus region (Ourense province, NW Spain). Flotation yield was based on two parameters: grade and recovery. Each of these parameters was determined in a series of experiments in which a single parameter was varied at a time while the remainder were kept constant. The results indicate {{that it is possible to}} obtain a high flotation yield using optimum process variables. With these optimum variables, the average concentrate grade and recovery were 95. 1 % and 25. 6 %, respectively...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} replacing fluxing and filler materials with rice straw ash (RSA) in manufacturing porcelain stoneware tile, using the design of experiments (DOE) methodology. The results of the characterization were used to obtain statistically significant, valid regression equations, relating the technological properties of the dried and fired test pieces to the raw materials content in the unfired mixtures. The regression models were analysed {{in relation to the}} X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy results and used to determine the most appropriate combinations of traditional raw materials and RSA to produce porcelain stoneware tiles with specific technological properties. The studied range of tile body compositions: clay (40 wt%), feldspar (20 – 50 wt%), <b>feldspathic</b> <b>sand</b> (5 – 20 wt%), and RSA (0 – 25 wt%) was shown to be appropriate for porcelain stoneware tile manufacture.

40|$|The {{refractory}} shales of the 1) urgatoire and Dakota formations in centrM Colorado {{were studied}} {{to determine the}} genesis of the kaolinite. The compositions of the shales ~ere similar, with variation only in relative amounts and grain size of the component minerals. The shMes consist primarily of kaolinite, subangular to subrounded quartz, and hydro-muscovite, with minor amounts of feldspar, montmoril lonitc, mixed-layer clays, and occasional traces of gypsum and zeolites. An inverse relation between the kaolinite and hydromuscovite conten~s uggests that hyda'omuscovlte was an intermediate mineral {{in the formation of the}} kaolonite. Derivation of vermicular kaolinite from feldspar and mica was evident from examina-t ion of thin sections _ The thinly banded interfingered lenses of montmoril lonlte suggest a detrital origin rather than alteration in situ of a volcanic ash to bentonite. Genesis of the kaolinite probably is similar to that proposed recently by Kesler ibr the Cretaceous clays of Georgia and South Carolina whereby <b>feldspathic</b> <b>sands</b> deposited in a near-shore nvironment were subsequently weathered to produce residual kaolinite...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the range}} of climates from high-latitude glacial to {{equatorial}} tropical, the mineral and chemical compositions of over 600 modern nonmarine, first-cycle sands and muds produced from felsic crystalline basement provenance in various tectonic settings were studied. Under glacial conditions, sediments are developed by mostly mechanical weathering and thus are mineralogically and chemically similar to their source rocks. Humid tropical climates yield quartz-rich sands, kaolinite-rich muds, along with Si, Mg, Ca, Na, and K in solution. Between these extremes, {{a wide range of}} detrital sediment compositions are developed in arid to wet climates. In arid-climate and semi-arid-climate sands, feldspar is commonly more abundant than quartz, and plagioclase. K-feldspar (except in the cases of granite source rocks); the muds are feldspathic with smectite dominant in the clays. With increasing temperature and moisture in temperate to subtropical climates, mafic silicates and feldspars are destroyed so that the sands range from arkoses with plagioclase as the major feldspar to subarkoses with dominant K-feldspar. Through this range of climate, muds become more kaolinitic and thus more aluminous with increasingly severe weathering. Typically, <b>feldspathic</b> <b>sands</b> are associated with feldspathic muds; with decreasing feldspar in sands, there is less feldspar in muds. With increasingly intense chemical weathering, rare earth elements (REE) are more fractionated into muds. Typically sands contain, 150 ppm REE (unless heavy mineral–rich) and associated muds contain. 150 ppm REE with much of the REE in heavy minerals. Abundance differences are greatest between humid tropical sands and muds. In many samples the REE are mostly in monazite, allanite, sphene, and apatite. More intensely weathered samples contain more xenotime and zircon, evidenced by Yb enrichment...|$|R
40|$|We use {{numerical}} simulations {{to derive}} the elastic properties of model monomineralic consolidated sand-stones. The model morphology {{is based on}} overlapping spheres of a mineral phase. We consider model quartzose and <b>feldspathic</b> <b>sands.</b> We generate moduli-porosity re-lationships for both the dry and water-saturated states. The ability to control pore space structure and mineral-ogy results in numerical data sets which exhibit much less noise than corresponding experimental data. The numer-ical data allows us to quantitatively analyze the effects of porosity and {{the properties of the}} mineral phase on the elastic properties of porous rocks. The agreement be-tween the numerical results and available experimental data for clean consolidated sandstones is encouraging. We compare our numerical data to commonly used theoretical and empirical moduli-porosity relationships. The self-consistent method gives the best theoretical fit to the numerical data. We find that the empirical relation-ship of Krief et al. is successful at describing the numeri-cal data for dry shear modulus and that the recent empir-ical method of Arns et al. gives a good match to the nu-merical data for Poisson’s ratio or Vp=Vs ratio of dry rock. The Raymer equation is the best of the velocity-porosity models for the water-saturated systems. Gassmann’s re-lations are shown to accurately map between the dry and fluid-saturated states. Based on these results, we propose a new empirical method, based solely on a knowledge of the mineral modulus, to estimate the full velocity-porosity relation-ship for monomineralic consolidated sands under dry and fluid-saturated states. The method uses the equa-tion of Krief et al. for the dry shear modulus and the empirical equation of Arns et al. for the dry Poisson’s ratio. Gassmann’s relations are applied to obtain the fluid-saturated states. The agreement between the new empirical method, the numerical data and available ex-perimental data for dry and water-saturated states is en-couraging...|$|R
40|$|The Pacoima area {{is located}} on an {{isolated}} hill in the northeast section of the San Fernando, the northeast portion of the Pacoima Quadrangle, Los Angeles County, California. Within it are exposed more than 2300 feet of Tertiary rocks, which comprise three units of Middle Miocene (?) age, and approximately 950 feet of Jurassic (?) granite basement. The formations are characterized by their mode of occurrence, marine and terrestial origin, diverse lithology, and structural features. The basement complex is composed of intrusive granite, small masses of granodiorite and a granodiorite gneiss {{with the development of}} schistosity in sections. During the long period of erosion of the metamorphics, the granitic rocks were exposed and may have provided clastic constituents for the overlying formations. As a result of rapid sedimentation in a transitional environment, the Middle Miocene Twin Peaks formation was laid down unconformably on the granite. This formation is essentially a large thinning bed of gray to buff pebble and cobble conglomerate grading to coarse yellow sandstone. The contact of conglomerate and granite is characterized by its faulted and depositional nature. Beds of extrusive andesite, basalt porphyry, compact vesicular amygdaloidal basalts, andesite breccia, interbedded <b>feldspathic</b> <b>sands</b> and clays of terrestial origin, and mudflow breccia comprise the Pacoima formation which overlies the Twin Peaks formation unconformably. A transgressing shallow sea accompanied settling of the region and initiated deposition of fine clastic sediments. The marine Topanga (?) formation is composed of brown to gray coarse sandstone grading into interbedded buff sandstones and gray shales. Intrusions of rhyolitedacite and ash beds mark continued but sporatic volcanism during this period. The area mapped represents an arch in the Tertiary sediments. Forces that produced the uplift of the granite structural high created stresses that were relieved by jointing and faulting. Vertical and horizontal movement along these faults has displaced beds, offset contacts and complicated their structure. Uplift and erosion have exposed the present sequence of beds which dip gently to the northeast. The isolated hill is believed to be in an early stage of maturity. ...|$|R
40|$|Old Hickory {{is a heavy}} mineral sand deposit located 60 km {{south of}} Richmond, Virginia, USA. It has been an active mine since 1997, {{operated}} by Iluka Resources, Inc. The deposit {{is one of several}} known large occurrences of heavy mineral sand along the "Fall Zone " from southern Virginia to central North Carolina. These deposits were formed by marine processes, probably at the intersection of shorelines and major paleorivers, during multiple transgressive/regressive events perhaps from Cretaceous through Tertiary time. The pre-mining resource was estimated at 75 million tons averaging 9 % heavy mineral. The average heavy mineral assemblage comprises 63 % ilmenite, 19 % zircon and 2. 5 % rutile plus leucoxene. The remaining non-valuable heavy minerals are predominantly staurolite, kyanite and sillimanite. The host sediment is dominantly clayey sand, which contains an average of 33 % material finer than 75 microns, mainly clay. The original sediment was probably quartz <b>sand</b> to <b>feldspathic</b> quartz <b>sand.</b> The clay currently disseminated in the deposit is thought to have been derived by weathering of feldspar and infiltration through the pile of clay-laden meteoric water. Much of the sediment is structureless from bioturbation, but locally planar cross-bedding...|$|R

40|$|The 85 -m Brushy Basin Member of the Morrison Formation {{in western}} Colorado {{comprises}} a 30 -m lower division mostly made of red-brown mudstone and a 55 -m upper division characterized by variegated smectitic mudstones. River-channel sandstones {{embedded in the}} floodplain mudstones tend to have cut down to resistant caliche paleosols. Also present are thin beds of lacustrine micritic limestone and altered silicic ashfalls. These strata were studied at three locations, from west to east: Trail Through Time (TT), Fruita Paleontological Resource Area (FP), and Echo Canyon (EC). ^ Morrison strata developed in a back-bulge depozone of a foreland basin system, with the debris eroded from thrust slices to the west. The Morrison strata differ from many foreland basins because the Morrison-age forebulge deposits west of the preserved basin were eroded due to plateau uplift of eastern Nevada and western Utah. ^ Petrographic modal analyses of 87 sandstones date a major pulse of the Nevadan Orogeny at {{the transition from the}} Salt Wash Member to the Brushy Basin Member in late Kimmeridgian time. Brushy Basin sandstones show significant increases upsection in plagioclase, total lithic fragments, and especially volcanic fragments. Abundant volcanic ash accumulated on the floodplains. The source areas for the Morrison Formation were the Ellko and Mogollon Highlands with <b>feldspathic</b> litharenite <b>sands</b> characterized by relatively high proportions of lithic and volcanic fragments and plagioclase. ^ Floodplain red-brown mudstones are highly smectitic with abundant smectite altered from silicic volcanic ash, in both the lower and the upper divisions. ^ Depositional facies and architectural element analysis show that the rivers were low gradient, mainly anastomosing, with perennial flow and seasonal peaks in discharge. ^ Dinosaur bone accumulations are found in some floodplain ponds. Isolated bones are present in anastomosing sandstones at the Trail Through Time. At Fruita Paleontological Resource Area, major acummulations of bones were rapidly buried in the deep pools at three bends in a meandering river. ...|$|R
