5|$|Eleven {{percent of}} Nescopeck Creek's {{watershed}} {{is made up}} of the Udorthents-Urban Land-Volusia series. There is some urban development over lands containing the soil series. Other areas where this soil series occurs have been surface-mined. The limiting factor <b>for</b> <b>plant</b> growth in this series is the rocky surface and the depth of the bedrock below. The Udorthents-Urban Land-Volusia soil series occurs in the southeastern and parts of the southwestern parts of the Nescopeck Creek watershed. The Lackawanna-Arnot-Morris series is present in nine percent of Nescopeck Creek's watershed. The Lackawanna-Arnot-Morris soil series mostly is near Nescopeck Creek's source, but there is some of it in the central Nescopeck Creek watershed.|$|E
5|$|In cool {{temperate}} regions, conifers often predominate; {{a widely}} distributed climax {{community in the}} far north of the northern hemisphere is moist taiga or northern coniferous forest (also called boreal forest). Taiga is the world's largest land biome, forming 29% of the world's forest cover. The long cold winter of the far north is unsuitable <b>for</b> <b>plant</b> growth and trees must grow rapidly in the short summer season when the temperature rises and the days are long. Light is very limited under their dense cover {{and there may be}} little plant life on the forest floor, although fungi may abound. Similar woodland is found on mountains where the altitude causes the average temperature to be lower thus reducing the length of the growing season.|$|E
5|$|Kristall {{contained}} furnaces for use {{in producing}} crystals under microgravity conditions (hence the choice of name for the module). The module was also equipped with biotechnology research equipment, including a small greenhouse <b>for</b> <b>plant</b> cultivation experiments which was equipped with a source of light and a feeding system, in addition to equipment for astronomical observations. The most obvious features of the module were the two Androgynous Peripheral Attach System (APAS-89) docking ports designed to be compatible with the Buran spacecraft. Although they were never used in a Buran docking, they were useful later during the Shuttle-Mir programme, providing a berthing location for US Space Shuttles.|$|E

Twining {{found he could}} not compete with natural ice, but in Melbourne Harrison's plant came to dominate the market. Australia's distance from New England, where journeys could take 115 days, and the consequent high level of wastage– 150 tons of the first 400-ton shipment to Sydney melted on route– made it relatively easy <b>for</b> <b>plant</b> ice {{to compete with the}} natural product.

5|$|Potassium {{compounds}} {{are often}} used as fertilisers as potassium is an important element <b>for</b> <b>plant</b> nutrition. Potassium hydroxide {{is a very strong}} base, and is used to control the pH of various substances. Potassium nitrate and potassium permanganate {{are often used}} as powerful oxidising agents. Potassium superoxide is used in breathing masks, as it reacts with carbon dioxide to give potassium carbonate and oxygen gas. Pure potassium metal is not often used, but its alloys with sodium may substitute for pure sodium in fast breeder nuclear reactors.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{interference}} genes, as {{components of}} the antiviral innate immune system in many eukaryotes, are involved in an evolutionary arms race with viral genes.

Studies of evolutionary rates in Drosophila have shown that genes in the RNAi pathway are subject to strong directional selection and are among the fastest-evolving genes in the Drosophila genome.|$|E

Its current president, since 2017, is Patrick S.

5|$|The mallard usually feeds by dabbling <b>for</b> <b>plant</b> food or grazing; {{there are}} reports of it eating frogs. However, in 2017 a flock of mallards in Romania were {{observed}} hunting small migratory birds, including grey wagtail and black redstart, the first documented occasion they had been seen attacking and consuming large vertebrates. It usually nests on a river bank, but not always near water. It is highly gregarious outside of the breeding season and forms large flocks, which are known as sords.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} pintail is a bird of open wetlands which nests on the ground, often {{some distance from}} water. It feeds by dabbling <b>for</b> <b>plant</b> food and adds small invertebrates to its diet during the nesting season. It is highly gregarious when not breeding, forming large mixed flocks with other species of duck. This duck's population is affected by predators, parasites and avian diseases. Human activities, such as agriculture, hunting and fishing, have also {{had a significant impact}} on numbers. Nevertheless, owed to the huge range and large population of this species, it is not threatened globally.|$|E

5|$|Antioxidants {{are used}} as food {{additives}} to help guard against food deterioration. Exposure to oxygen and sunlight are the two main factors in the oxidation of food, so food is preserved by keeping {{in the dark and}} sealing it in containers or even coating it in wax, as with cucumbers. However, as oxygen is also important <b>for</b> <b>plant</b> respiration, storing plant materials in anaerobic conditions produces unpleasant flavors and unappealing colors. Consequently, packaging of fresh fruits and vegetables contains an ~8% oxygen atmosphere. Antioxidants are an especially important class of preservatives as, unlike bacterial or fungal spoilage, oxidation reactions still occur relatively rapidly in frozen or refrigerated food. These preservatives include natural antioxidants such as ascorbic acid (AA, E300) and tocopherols (E306), as well as synthetic antioxidants such as propyl gallate (PG, E310), tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA, E320) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT, E321).|$|E
5|$|Cominco's president, Selwyn G. Blaylock, was cautious. There {{might be}} no post-war demand for heavy water, and the patent {{on the process}} was held by Albert Edgar Knowles, so a {{profit-sharing}} agreement would be required. In response, Taylor offered $20,000 <b>for</b> <b>plant</b> modifications. There the matter rested until 6 December, when Blaylock {{had a meeting with}} the British physicist G. I. Higson, who informed him that Taylor had become discouraged with Cominco, and had decided to find another source of heavy water. Blaylock invited Taylor to visit Trail, which he did from 5 to 8 January 1942. The two soon found common ground. Blaylock agreed to produce heavy water at Trail, and quickly secured approval from the Chairman of the Board, Sir Edward Beatty. A contract was signed on 1 August 1942. The heavy water project became known as the P-9 Project in October 1942.|$|E
