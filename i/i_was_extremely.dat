25|$|In Bristol, Southey and Coleridge {{continued}} {{to flesh out}} their plans, and spoke openly of their radical ideas. One listener was John Poole, cousin of Tom Poole of Nether Stowey, who writes of his encounter with the two young men: “Each of them was shamefully hot with Democratic rage as regards politics, and both Infidel as to religion. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> indignant…”.|$|E
500|$|I got a call, {{they wanted}} me {{to be a part of}} that record. [...] It was {{actually}} the last day before Kanye had to turn the record in, and I think that pressure just made it that much more special to me. So I just sat there, approached the record openly and as straightforward as I could. When I laid the verse, 30 minutes later, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> happy. I sent it to him, and he was too. I think it was one of the dopest verses I did this year." ...|$|E
500|$|Leonard Boyarsky, art {{director}} of the original Fallout, when asked about Interplay Entertainment's sale of the rights to Bethesda Softworks, said [...] "To be perfectly honest, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> disappointed {{that we did not}} get the chance to make the next Fallout game. This {{has nothing to do with}} Bethesda, it's just that we've always felt that Fallout was ours and it was just a technicality that Interplay happened to own it. It sort of felt as if our child had been sold to the highest bidder, and we had to just sit by and watch. Since I have absolutely no idea what their plans are, I can't comment on whether I think they're going in the right direction with it or not.".|$|E

500|$|Among other {{contemporary}} rock musicians, Stephen Stills was {{so taken}} with the song that he had its lyrics carved on a stone monument in his yard. Lennon also admired the track, saying of Harrison: [...] "His mind and his music are clear. There is his innate talent, he brought that sound together." [...] David Crosby, who introduced Harrison to Shankar's music in 1965, described Harrison's fusion of ideas as [...] "utterly brilliant", adding: [...] "He did it beautifully and tastefully... He did it at absolutely the highest level that he could, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> proud of him for that." [...] Writing in the [...] "100 Rock Icons" [...] issue of Classic Rock, in 2006, singer Paul Rodgers cited the track to support Harrison's standing as what the magazine called [...] "the Beatles' musical medicine man". Rodgers said: [...] "He introduced me and a generation of people worldwide to {{the wisdom of the}} East. His thought-provoking 'Within You Without You' – with sitars, tablas and deep lyrics – was something completely different, even in a world full of unique music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Robertson also co-wrote a {{song with}} Lynott, [...] "Borderline", {{for which he}} did receive a writing credit.

[...] Alcock confirmed that Robertson had significant lyrical input on this track, and that the band's other guitarist Scott Gorham had similar influence on the lyrics for [...] "Sweet Marie".|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the {{explicit}} {{shots in the}} final photo slide show in which his character is seen receiving fellatio in an elevator, Galifianakis confirmed that a prosthesis {{was used for the}} scene, and that he had been more embarrassed than anyone else during the creation of the shot. [...] "You would think that I wouldn't be the one who was embarrassed; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> embarrassed. I really didn't even want it in there.

2500|$|Despite their jungle training, the Australians {{found the}} going {{incredibly}} difficult. Captain R.N. Thompson of the 2/14th said [...] "I {{was one of}} the fittest members, but on the second day, climbing the Golden Stairs <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> fatigued. A small dixie of tea made me vomit and I could not eat." [...] While they struggled over the ranges, the Japanese bombed the Port Moresby airfield, destroying two of the Dakotas. When Potts reached Myola he found only 5,000 rations. Mystery and controversy abound regarding the missing rations.

Ó Sé was forced to issue an embarrassing apology; however, he still guided his team to a seventh Munster title in eight years. Kerry, however, were later trounced by eventual champions Tyrone in the All-Ireland semi-final. Ó Sé later described the result as a [...] "disastrous defeat". He was fired as manager.

Following his recall to the Seleção squad, Kaká stated, [...] "I admit {{it was a}} surprise this call... When the list was published, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> happy. It was like my first call-up." [...] Brazil coach Mano Menezes stated that despite Kaká and Oscar's similarities, the two would be able to play alongside each other, as Kaká had slightly changed his playing style. On his return to the national side, Kaká scored in both matches, a 6–0 win over Iraq and a 4–0 win over Japan.

2500|$|However, all was {{not well}} within the group. A legal dispute with Rough Trade had delayed the album by almost seven months (it had been {{completed}} in November 1985), and Marr {{was beginning to feel}} the stress of the band's exhausting touring and recording schedule. He later told NME, [...] "'Worse for wear' wasn't the half of it: <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> ill. By the time the tour actually finished it was all getting a little bit... dangerous.

B.Slade spoke of the album, commenting Full Moon single-handedly changed the vocal game.

2500|$|In 1989 Spin {{magazine}} rated The Queen is Dead as {{number one}} of [...] "The Greatest Albums Ever Made". Spin {{was not alone}} in this designation—numerous periodicals rank the Smiths and their albums, especially The Queen is Dead, high on their best ever lists. NME, for example, has dubbed the Smiths the most important rock band of all time. However, a legal dispute with Rough Trade had delayed the album by almost seven months (it had been completed in November 1985), and Marr was beginning to feel the stress of the band's exhausting touring and recording schedule. He later told NME, [...] "'Worse for wear' wasn't the half of it: <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> ill. By the time the tour actually finished it was all getting a little bit... dangerous.

Despite their continued success, personal differences within the band – including the increasingly strained relationship between Morrissey and Marr—saw them on the verge of splitting.|$|E

2500|$|Little-known abroad, but {{extremely}} popular in Naples, {{is the local}} stage musical form called the Sceneggiata. [...] Around {{the start of the}} 20th century, they were performed in the U.S. in areas populated by Italian immigrants. [...] The form has been called [...] "a musical soap opera" [...] and generally revolves around domestic grief, the agony of leaving home, personal deceit and treachery, betrayal in love, and life in the world of petty crime. It is always sung and spoken in Neapolitan dialect. Action stops every few minutes for someone to break out in song. As a rule, many of the plots were flimsy after-the-fact vehicles to promote particular songs. [...] The sceneggiata started shortly after World War <b>I,</b> <b>was</b> <b>extremely</b> popular in the 1920s, then faded, but has been enjoying somewhat of a comeback with newer generations of performers since the 1960s. The most populars performers of the genre are the Neapolitans, Mario Merola, Pino Mauro and Mario Trevi. The most popular sceneggiata ever written is Zappatore, (meaning, exactly, [...] "clodbuster," [...] one who works the land and breaks up the soil for farming) written to feature a song of that name in 1929 by Bovio and Albano. It then became a stage production and was even made into a film on various occasions, the first one actually from a film company in Little Italy in New York City.|$|E
