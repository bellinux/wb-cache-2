Their relative importance {{for the maintenance of}} normal glucose metabolism is not fully known. In a population-based sample of 1114 individuals, aged 58 - 78 years, dietary intakes were assessed by 4 d food records and cardiorespiratory fitness as maximal oxygen uptake. Insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, the early-phase disposition <b>index</b> (<b>DI</b> 30) and the total disposition <b>index</b> (<b>DI</b> 120) were assessed based on an oral glucose tolerance test. Linear associations were modelled using linear regression. Combined effects were studied by introducing SF and fibre intakes, as well as cardiorespiratory fitness and waist circumference (WC) as dichotomised variables in general linear models. Intakes of dietary fibre and whole-grain bread were positively associated with insulin sensitivity, independent of physical fitness and WC. In women, dietary fibre intake was also positively associated with DI 30. The negative association of high WC with DI 30 was attenuated by a combination of low SF intake and high cardiorespiratory fitness. In conclusion, dietary fibre and a combination of low SF intake and high cardiorespiratory fitness may contribute to the maintenance of normal glucose metabolism, independent of WC...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} a Wavelet Coefficient based approach using experiments {{to understand the}} sensitivity of ultrasonic signals due to parametric variation of a crack configuration in a metal plate. A PZT patch sensor/actuator system integrated to a metal plate with through-thickness crack is used. The proposed approach uses piezoelectric patches, {{which can be used}} to both actuate and sense the ultrasonic signals. While this approach leads to more flexibility and reduced cost for larger scalability of the sensor/actuator network, the complexity of the signals increases as compared to what is encountered in conventional ultrasonic NDE problems using selective wave modes. A Damage <b>Index</b> (<b>DI)</b> has been introduced, which is function of wavelet coefficient. Experiments have been carried out for various crack sizes, crack orientations and band-limited tone-burst signal through FIR filter. For a 1 cm long crack interrogated with 20 kHz tone-burst signal, the Damage <b>Index</b> (<b>DI)</b> for the horizontal crack orientation increases by about 70 % with respect to that for 135 degrees oriented crack and it increases by about 33 % with respect to the vertically oriented crack.

The ProTMDMulti-Part II was validated using the Helkimo Clinical Dysfunction <b>Index</b> (<b>Di).</b> The construct validity was tested using the analysis of the ability of ProTMDMulti-part II to differentiate the CG from the TMDG and to measure the changes that occurred in the TMDG between the period before and after TMD treatment.

There was a statistically significant correlation between the Helkimo Clinical Dysfunction <b>Index</b> (<b>Di)</b> and the severity scores of the ProTMDMulti-Part II.

40|$|Structural Health Monitoring Systems {{based on}} {{embedded}} FBG sensors, to identify damage conditions, are largely {{dependent on the}} spectral distortion of the sensors. The uneven stress gradient occurring along the grating of FBG sensors, due to damage inside composite structures can be estimated by analysing significant changes that appear in the FBG response spectra. However, the stochastic nature of the distorted shape of the FBG spectra {{makes it difficult to}} interpret and quantify the existing damage at the location of the FBG sensors. There are several indexing methods proposed by researchers. We have previously presented a novel concept of the Distortion <b>Index</b> (<b>DI)</b> which is defined using distorted spectra of FBG sensors. It was observed that the DI increases with the increase in damage size. The Distortion <b>Index</b> (<b>DI)</b> is introduced to create a correlation between the damage and the distortion of the response spectra of a FBG sensor. This index provides the ability to generalise the distortion of FBG spectra for a particular structure. The index can be used to quantify the damage in the structure relative to its original condition, which can be the condition of structure during a regulated time, i. e. a month uninterrupted operation or first hours in operation, of a structure can be used as no damage condition. In this paper we discuss the application of distortion index and comparison with available several other indexes. ...|$|R
