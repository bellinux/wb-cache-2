5|$|The {{differences}} in reduction potentials is attributed in the cobaltocenium {{system to the}} <b>inductive</b> effect of the alkyl groups, further stabilising the 18-valence electron species. A similar effect {{is seen in the}} rhodocenium data shown above, again consistent with <b>inductive</b> effects. In the substituted iridocenium system, cyclic voltammetry investigations shows irreversible reductions at temperatures as low as −60°C; by comparison, the reduction of the corresponding rhodocenes is quasi-reversible at room temperature and fully reversible at −35°C. The irreversibility of the substituted iridocenium reductions is attributed to the extremely rapid dimerisation of the resulting 19-valence electron species, which further illustrates that iridocenes are less stable than their corresponding rhodocenes.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} basic {{strategies}} for biological pest control: classical (importation), where a natural enemy of a pest is {{introduced in the}} hope of achieving control; <b>inductive</b> (augmentation), in which a large population of natural enemies are administered for quick pest control; and inoculative (conservation), in which measures are taken to maintain natural enemies through regular reestablishment.|$|E
5|$|With {{organic acids}} <b>inductive</b> effects and mesomeric effects affect the pKa values. A simple example is {{provided}} by the effect of replacing the hydrogen atoms in acetic acid by the more electronegative chlorine atom. The electron-withdrawing effect of the substituent makes ionisation easier, so successive pKa values decrease in the series 4.7, 2.8, 1.4, and 0.7 when 0, 1, 2, or 3 chlorine atoms are present. The Hammett equation, provides a general expression for the effect of substituents.|$|E
5|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{is useful for}} staging OCD lesions, evaluating {{the integrity of the}} joint surface, and distinguishing normal variants of bone formation from OCD by showing bone and cartilage edema {{in the area of the}} irregularity. MRI provides information regarding features of the articular cartilage and bone under the cartilage, including edema, fractures, fluid interfaces, articular surface integrity, and fragment displacement. A low T1 and high T2 signal at the fragment interface is seen in active lesions. This indicates an unstable lesion or recent microfractures. While MRI and arthroscopy have a close correlation, X-ray films tend to be less <b>inductive</b> of similar MRI results.|$|E
25|$|<b>Inductive</b> {{arguments}} argue {{their conclusions}} through <b>inductive</b> reasoning.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypothesis}} in the <b>inductive</b> {{step that}} the statement holds for some n {{is called the}} induction hypothesis (or <b>inductive</b> hypothesis). To perform the <b>inductive</b> step, one assumes the induction hypothesis and then uses this assumption to prove the statement for n+1.|$|E
25|$|<b>Inductive</b> {{reasoning}} contrasts {{strongly with}} deductive reasoning in that, {{even in the}} best, or strongest, cases of <b>inductive</b> reasoning, {{the truth of the}} premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. Instead, the conclusion of an <b>inductive</b> argument follows with some degree of probability. Relatedly, the conclusion of an <b>inductive</b> argument contains more information than is already contained in the premises. Thus, this method of reasoning is ampliative.|$|E
25|$|In words, {{the basis}} P(0) and the <b>inductive</b> step (namely, that the <b>inductive</b> {{hypothesis}} P(k) implies P(k+1)) together imply that P(n) for any natural number n. The axiom of induction {{asserts that the}} validity of inferring that P(n) holds for any natural number n from the basis and the <b>inductive</b> step.|$|E

25|$|Proofs using <b>inductive</b> logic, while {{considered}} mathematical in nature, seek {{to establish}} propositions {{with a degree}} of certainty, which acts in a similar manner to probability, and may be less than full certainty. <b>Inductive</b> logic {{should not be confused with}} mathematical induction.|$|E
25|$|<b>Inductive</b> logic {{programming}} {{is concerned with}} generalizing positive and negative examples {{in the context of}} background knowledge: machine learning of logic programs.

25|$|Looking at logical categorizations of {{different}} types of reasoning the traditional main division made in philosophy is between deductive reasoning and <b>inductive</b> reasoning. Formal logic has been described as the science of deduction. The study of <b>inductive</b> reasoning is generally carried out within the field known as informal logic or critical thinking.|$|E

25|$|Early {{forms of}} analogical {{reasoning}}, <b>inductive</b> reasoning and categorical syllogism {{were introduced in}} Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), Sharia (Islamic law) and Kalam (Islamic theology) from the 7th century {{with the process of}} Qiyas, before the Arabic translations of Aristotle's works. Later during the Islamic Golden Age, there was a logical debate among Islamic philosophers, logicians and theologians over whether the term Qiyas refers to analogical reasoning, <b>inductive</b> reasoning or categorical syllogism. Some Islamic scholars argued that Qiyas refers to <b>inductive</b> reasoning, which Ibn Hazm (994-1064) disagreed with, arguing that Qiyas does not refer to <b>inductive</b> reasoning, but refers to categorical syllogism in a real sense and analogical reasoning in a metaphorical sense. On the other hand, al-Ghazali (1058–1111) (and in modern times, Abu Muhammad Asem al-Maqdisi) argued that Qiyas refers to analogical reasoning in a real sense and categorical syllogism in a metaphorical sense. Other Islamic scholars at the time, however, argued that the term Qiyas refers to both analogical reasoning and categorical syllogism in a real sense.|$|E
25|$|While Avicenna (980-1037) often {{relied on}} {{deductive}} reasoning in philosophy, {{he used a}} different approach in medicine. Ibn Sina contributed inventively {{to the development of}} <b>inductive</b> logic, which he used to pioneer the idea of a syndrome. In his medical writings, Avicenna was the first to describe the methods of agreement, difference and concomitant variation which are critical to <b>inductive</b> logic and the scientific method.|$|E

25|$|Intuitive use of {{mathematical}} induction, however, the <b>inductive</b> hypothesis was not formulated or employed in proofs.|$|E
25|$|It is {{sometimes}} desirable {{to prove a}} statement involving two natural numbers, n and m, by iterating the induction process. That is, one performs a basis step and an <b>inductive</b> step for n, and {{in each of those}} performs a basis step and an <b>inductive</b> step for m. See, for example, the proof of commutativity accompanying addition of natural numbers. More complicated arguments involving three or more counters are also possible.|$|E
25|$|The <b>inductive</b> step: prove that, if the {{statement}} holds for some natural number n, then {{the statement}} holds for n+1.|$|E
25|$|Next, each {{formula is}} {{assigned}} a truth value. The <b>inductive</b> definition {{used to make}} this assignment is called the T-schema.|$|E
25|$|Power factor {{correction}} brings the power factor of an AC power circuit closer to 1 by supplying or absorbing reactive power, adding capacitors or inductors that act {{to cancel the}} <b>inductive</b> or capacitive effects of the load, respectively. In the case of offsetting the <b>inductive</b> effect of motor loads, capacitors can be locally connected. These capacitors help to generate reactive power {{to meet the demand}} of the <b>inductive</b> loads. This will keep that reactive power from having to flow {{all the way from the}} utility generator to the load. In the electricity industry, inductors are said to consume reactive power and capacitors are said to supply it, even though reactive power is just energy moving back and forth on each AC cycle.|$|E

25|$|Aneutronic fusion {{produces}} {{energy in}} the form of charged particles instead of neutrons. This means that energy from aneutronic fusion could be captured using direct conversion instead of the steam cycle that is used for neutrons. Direct conversion techniques can either be <b>inductive,</b> based on changes in magnetic fields, electrostatic, based on pitting charged particles against an electric field, or photoelectric, in which light energy is captured.

25|$|As {{either the}} Lewis acidity {{of the base}} or the {{coordinating}} ability of the substituent decrease, a mechanism involving purely <b>inductive</b> effects becomes more important. For instance, the lithiation of 1 with lithium di(isopropyl)amide (LDA) affords only the product of benzylic metalation 2; none of the ortho-lithiated product 3 is observed. This result is explained by a mechanism in which the amide substituent affects the acidity of the para benzylic position solely through <b>inductive</b> effects and coordination of the base is not operative. Deprotonation occurs to afford the most thermodynamically stable product.|$|E
