5|$|The easiest {{species to}} confuse with the Carolina wren is Bewick's wren, which differs in being smaller {{but with a}} longer tail, grayer-brown above and whiter below. The Carolina and white-browed wrens differ from the <b>house</b> <b>wren</b> in being larger, with a decidedly longer bill and hind toe; their culmen has a notch behind the tip.|$|E
5|$|This nuthatch's {{responses}} to predators {{may be linked}} to a reproductive strategy. A study compared the white-breasted nuthatch with the red-breasted nuthatch in terms of the willingness of males to feed incubating females on the nest when presented with models of predators. The models were of a sharp-shinned hawk, which hunts adult nuthatches, and a <b>house</b> <b>wren,</b> which destroys eggs. The white-breasted nuthatch is shorter-lived than the red-breasted nuthatch, but has more young, and was found to respond more strongly to the egg predator, whereas the red-breasted showed greater concern with the hawk. This supports the theory that longer-lived species benefit from adult survival and future breeding opportunities, while birds with shorter life spans place more value on the survival of their larger broods.|$|E
5|$|For the few {{species on}} which data are available, the average {{nuthatch}} lifespan {{in the wild}} is between 2 and 3.5years, although ages of up to 10 years have been recorded. The Eurasian nuthatch has an adult annual survival rate of 53% and the male Corsican nuthatch 61.6%. Nuthatches and other small woodland birds share the same predators: accipiters, owls, squirrels and woodpeckers. An American study showed that nuthatch responses to predators {{may be linked to}} reproductive strategies. It measured the willingness of males of two species to feed incubating females on the nest when presented with models of a sharp-shinned hawk, which hunts adult nuthatches, or a <b>house</b> <b>wren,</b> which destroys eggs. The white-breasted nuthatch is shorter-lived than the red-breasted nuthatch, but has more young, and was found to respond more strongly to the egg predator, whereas the red-breasted showed greater concern with the hawk. This supports the theory that longer-lived species benefit from adult survival and future breeding opportunities while birds with shorter life spans place more value on the survival of their larger broods.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} to explain its decline in its eastern range, including pesticide use and competition from other bird species. [...] The most likely reason seems to be competition from <b>house</b> <b>wrens.</b> <b>House</b> <b>wrens</b> compete with Bewick's wrens for similar nesting sites. <b>House</b> <b>wrens</b> will destroy both the nests and eggs of Bewick's wrens. [...] The reforestation of once open land has also negatively impacted the eastern Bewick's wrens.|$|R
40|$|Chapters 1 and 2 {{focus on}} {{two aspects of}} trilled song that are likely {{physically}} challenge to produce: low vocal deviation and high consistency. Chapter 1 (in review at Behavioral Ecology) describes a playback study to territorial male <b>house</b> <b>wrens</b> showing that males do not respond differently to songs with different trill performance and consistency characteristics. Chapter 2 examines whether song traits correlate with male quality measures, with social pairing success, with extra-pair mating success, or with annual reproductive success. Again, I {{found no evidence that}} these song parameters are important. I conclude that <b>house</b> <b>wrens</b> do not use these song components as signals of male quality. In Chapters 3 and 4, I examine post-copulatory sexual selection in <b>house</b> <b>wrens.</b> Chapter 3 (accepted at the Journal of Ornithology) examines correlations between male quality measures and sperm morphology; we also show that sperm morphology is consistent between years, despite testicular regression and regrowth. In Chapter 4, we ask whether variation in sperm morphology is related to extra-pair paternity success, and find that it is not. Chapter 5 (accepted at Ethology) takes a more mechanistic perspective, and asks whether high circulating testosterone is necessary for aggressive behaviors in <b>house</b> <b>wrens.</b> I found no evidence to suggest that this is the case...|$|R
40|$|Incubation {{periods of}} Neotropical birds are often longer {{than those of}} related species at {{temperate}} latitudes. We conducted a common-garden experiment {{to test the hypothesis}} that longer tropical incubation periods result from longer embryo development times rather than from different patterns of parental incubation behavior. <b>House</b> <b>wrens,</b> one of few species whose geographic range includes tropical equatorial and temperate high latitudes, have incubation periods averaging 1. 2 days longer at tropical latitudes. We incubated eggs of <b>house</b> <b>wrens</b> in Illinois and Panama under identical conditions in mechanical incubators. Even after factoring out differences in egg size, tropical <b>house</b> <b>wrens</b> still required 1. 33 days longer, on average, to hatch. We conclude that parental attendance patterns do not account for latitudinal differences in incubation period but that some other as yet unmeasured factor intrinsic to the egg or embryo, or both, extends development time in the tropics...|$|R

40|$|The fitness-related {{consequences}} of egg mass, independent of confounding influences associated with parental quality, remain poorly understood for wild birds {{in general and}} for passerines in particular. We performed cross-fostering experiments {{to test the hypothesis}} that egg mass, independent of parental quality, is the primary determinant of fitness-related traits in nestling <b>house</b> <b>wrens</b> (Troglodytes aedon), an insectivorous passerine. Nestling mass was significantly correlated with the mass of the eggs from which nestlings hatched early but not late in the nestling period in early-season broods. In contrast, in late-season broods, nestling mass was correlated with egg mass until nestlings achieved asymptotic mass. Neither nestling growth nor survival to nest leaving was related to egg mass in either early- or late-season broods; however, nestlings in late-season broods grew more slowly than did nestlings in early-season broods. We propose that nestling mass and egg mass remained correlated throughout the nestling period in late-season broods because decreased arthropod food resources late in the breeding season constrain parents' ability to provision nestlings. We conclude that female <b>house</b> <b>wrens</b> in this population trade-off clutch size for greater egg mass to maximise reproductive success in late-season broods...|$|R
