40|$|The {{packing density}} of {{filaments}} in zero-twist <b>stretch</b> <b>yarns</b> {{is very low}} and the filament segments between points of entanglement are very long. This combination results in relatively high mobility of filament segments along the yarn axis and in any direction away from the yarn axis [1]. The relatively high mobility of the filaments means that the <b>stretch</b> <b>yarn</b> structure is easily deformed and that yarn has poor dimensional stability in general. The flattening out of the yarn structure occurs rather easily under normal bend-ing or compressional deformations. The spreading of fila-ments changes the yarn cross-sectional shape to a rather flat, ribbon-like structure, or one that is quite elliptical. This collapse of the filament bundle permits a much greater area of contact with other surfaces, resulting in greater friction and discomfort in apparel applications. I...|$|R

40|$|Elastane yarns {{are often}} used to produce stretch fabrics on {{knitting}} machines as well as rapier weaving machines. On air-jet weaving looms their use is still limited. That is why {{the objective of this}} paper is to investigate the weavability of elastane based <b>stretch</b> <b>yarns</b> on air-jet looms. Bobbins of elastane were woven on an air-jet loom and a distinction of the bobbins in three categories was made according to the most important production processes for elastane yarn: core twist, core spun and air covered. Yarn properties such as linear density, elongation at break and Air Index value were determined, weaving tests were performed and properties of the resulting fabric were determined...|$|R

30|$|For {{the elastic}} {{recovery}} rate of Hanji denim fabrics {{developed in the}} study, we compared the result with that of existing stretch denim fabrics (S 1, S 2). Basically, the standard denim fabrics are made of unbleached cotton yarn, {{so there is no}} elasticity and many wrinkles. Recently, denim fabrics have been given elasticity according to consumers’ needs. The existing denim fabrics, which were compared with the Hanji denim fabric produced in this study, were denim fabrics with medium stretch (S 1) and high stretch (S 2). The approximate structure of the existing denim fabrics (S 1, S 2), using the analysis of fabric structure, showed cotton yarns (navy color) and <b>stretch</b> <b>yarns</b> used as warp and weft, respectively. Most Hanji denim fabrics produced, except for the DF 1 (C 10) and the DF 2 (C 10), showed a higher elastic recovery rate than that of existing medium stretch denim fabric (S 1). The high recovery rate trend resulted mainly in the denim fabrics using the rope-dyed yarn.|$|R
5000|$|In knitting, a yarn over is {{technique}} {{in which the}} yarn is passed over the right-hand knitting needle. In general, the new loop is knitted on the next row, either by itself (producing a hole) or together with an adjacent stitch (e.g., in [...] "tucked" [...] slip stitches). The yarn-over may also be dropped on the next row, producing a longer <b>stretch</b> of <b>yarn</b> between the stitches of the previous row. Conversely, {{the effect of a}} yarn-over can be obtained by picking up the yarn between stitches of the previous row; the difference is that the yarn then is shorter, and the flanking stitches of the previous row may be overly drawn together.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of a 46, 000 word polyphonic novella, Unravel, and an exegesis, Picking at Scabs: the Underside of Grief. The works are companion pieces, sitting side-by-side, and together they plumb the complex depths of loss and its resultant disorder, painful longing, and sorrow. The novella, representing 75 % {{of the work and}} creative practice, is a multilayered work, which scrapes at the potent unspeakability of the presence of absence in the lives of its chief protagonists, Hana and Guy. As the novella progresses, loss is unraveled to reveal the interplay of remembering and forgetting, past and present {{and the ways in which}} these knotty fibres are connected with the strands of memory, trauma, silence, and the uncanny. Each of these threads is woven into the novella and as they plait together, loosen and fray, they expose the mystery, lies and secrets at the core of the novella. The exegesis, which comprises 25 % of the thesis, picks at loss to uncover and loosen a complex and worn tangle of knots and loops. In this way, the exegesis and creative work are constantly in dialogue and while neither provides all the answers, both <b>stretch</b> the <b>yarn</b> to reveal an enthusiasm of practice...|$|R
40|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{tested in}} this study was that intraoral exposure of elastomeric chains alters their tensile strength. For such purpose, it was evaluated the in situ behavior of different <b>elastomeric</b> chains <b>stretched</b> for 3 weeks. Three kinds of elastomeric chains, Plastic chain (PC), Memory chain (MC) and Super slick chain (SSC), were randomly placed in 3 quadrants of 13 patient in a fixed distance of 16 mm and mean initial force of 180 g. Tensile testing was performed in an universal testing machine at different intervals: initial, 1 h, 24 h, 1 week, 2 weeks and 3 weeks. A two-way ANOVA test was performed to identify the influence of both material and time on the force decrease. A subsequent one-way ANOVAtest with the Tukey's post hoc test was used to identify statistically significant intragroup and intergroup remaining force (g and %) differences at 5 % significance level. The effect of both the material and the time factors were significant. All groups showed significant force decrease after the 1 -h period (23 % for PC and 14 % for MC and SSC). At the end of the 3 -week period, the remaining force was 57 % (96 g), 67 % (129 g) and 71 % (125 g) for PC, MC and SSC, respectively. In conclusion, intraoral exposure of elastomeric chains altered their tensile strength. In general, the greater force decrease occurred within the first hour. The remaining force of the enhanced chains measured at each time interval was greater than the conventional one (PC). After 3 weeks, only the enhanced chains maintained the force applied over 100 g...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{determination}} of the effective mechanical moduli of textiles from mechanical measurements is usually difficult due to their discrete architecture, which makes micromechanical analyses a relevant alternative to access those properties. Micropolar continuum models describing the effective mechanical behavior of woven fabric monolayers are constructed from the homogenization of an identified repetitive pattern of the textile within a representative unit cell. The interwoven yarns within the textile are represented as a network of trusses connected by nodes at their crossover points. These trusses have extensional and bending rigidities to allow for <b>yarn</b> <b>stretching</b> and flexion, and a transverse shear deformation is additionally considered. Interactions between yarns at the crossover points are captured by beam segments connecting the nodes. The woven fabric is modeled after homogenization as an anisotropic planar continuum with two preferred material directions in the mean plane of the textile. Based on the developed methodology, the effective mechanical properties of plain weave and twill are evaluated, including their bending moduli and characteristic flexural lengths. A satisfactory agreement is obtained between the effective moduli obtained by homogenization and numerical values obtained by finite element simulations performed over periodic unit cells...|$|R
30|$|This study {{facilitates}} {{an effective}} design {{and development of}} various high stretch compression products by analyzing fabric size, stretch properties, and clothing pressure for various knit structures. Four types of fabrics were knitted with polyester SCY (Single Covered Yarn). Then fabric size including weight and thickness, stretch properties (stretch, elastic recovery), and clothing pressure were then measured, to analyze their interrelation. A comparison of fabric size indicated that yarn floating caused reduction in both course and wale-wise specimens; in addition, yarn overlapping caused a release in course-wise and shrinkage in wale–wise due to tuck. The high density caused by shrinkage in the course-wise due to yarn floating rather than overlapping influenced the weight and thickness of knitted fabrics. Yarn floating reduced course-wise elasticity and increased wale-wise elasticity in the fabric <b>stretch</b> test; however, <b>yarn</b> overlapping reduced elasticity in both directions. The elastic recovery analysis indicated that the recovery value gap among four specimens decreased over time. In comparison clothing pressure, ‘plain-float’ fabric showed higher clothing pressure than ‘plain’, while the pressure value of ‘plain-tuck’ was similar to ‘plain’. Dimensional change in course-wise had a greater effect on clothing pressure than in wale-wise in the correlation among fabric size, stretch properties and clothing pressure. Weight and thickness change exerted a strong influence on clothing pressure which vertically presses down the body. The clothing pressure value of knitted specimen having a lower stretch ratio was higher in course-wise.|$|R

40|$|Thermoplastic {{elastomers}} (TPEs) {{are known}} to exhibit a phase-separated morphology which depends on their chemical structure and processing. The design of novel TPEs with predefined properties which are also independent of the material thermal history has so far remained a challenge. The focus of this work is on the semicrystalline morphology of all-aliphatic thermoplastic elastomers consisting of alternating polytetrahydrofuran (PTHF) segments and uniform glycine or β-alanine bisoxalamide units. The thickness of the hard segment crystals {{was found to be}} highly monodisperse and independent of the sample thermal history. Using Nanocalorimetry, we observed that at cooling rates as high as 12 [*] 000 °C s– 1 the bisoxalamide segments can still crystallize although the crystallization temperature decreases by ca. 26 °C. The surface free energy of the hard block crystals is found to be extremely low (∼ 18 mJ·m− 2), which is likely due to the entropic contribution of soft segments forming tie chains bridging the neighboring crystals. To investigate the combined effect of crystal orientation and phase transitions, simultaneous time-resolved X-ray scattering and mechanical tensile tests were performed. Upon <b>stretching,</b> <b>elastomeric</b> PTHF segments with lengths above 1000 g mol– 1 crystallize at ambient temperatures. Under these conditions two main morphologies were observed: at low strains the long axes of the fibril-like crystals were oriented parallel to the flow direction, whereas higher strains caused bisoxalamide crystal fragmentation and changed their preferential direction to the one perpendicular to the drawing direction. The chain tilts in the bisoxalamide crystals were calculated from the characteristic four-spot SAXS patterns and were ∼ 5 °– 16 ° in the case of glycine end-groups and 24 ° for alanine and propyl terminal groups. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to determine the chain tilt for the nonlamellar crystals in block copolymer...|$|R
