5|$|In Orson Welles's {{film version}} of Macbeth (1948), Fleance is briefly seen again {{at the very end}} of the movie. He does not speak <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>scene,</b> but he has {{returned}} to Scotland with the army of Malcolm and Macduff, and is shown along with those hailing Malcolm as the new king after the killing of Macbeth.|$|E
5|$|Star Wars creator George Lucas {{personally}} directed Shaw for {{his appearance}} in the final scene of the film, {{in which he is}} a Force Ghost of Anakin. Shaw's image <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>scene</b> was replaced with that of Christensen in the 2004 release. This last attempt to tie the prequel and original trilogies together proved to be possibly the most controversial change in the Star Wars re-releases.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Caligari is not {{the only}} symbol of arrogant {{authority}} in the film. In fact, he is a victim of harsh authority himself during the scene with the dismissive town clerk, who brushes him off and ignores him to focus on his paperwork. Film historian Thomas Elsaesser argues that Dr. Caligari's murderous rampage through Cesare {{can be seen as a}} rebellious, anti-authoritarian streak in response to such experiences as these, even in spite of his own authoritarianism. The Expressionistic set design <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>scene</b> further amplifies the power of the official and the weakness of his supplicant; the clerk towers in an excessively high chair over the small and humiliated Dr. Caligari. The scene represents class and status differences, and conveys the psychological experience of being simultaneously outraged and powerless in the face of a petty bureaucracy. Another common visual motif is the use of stairways to illustrate the hierarchy of authority figures, such as the multiple stairs leading up to police headquarters, and three staircases ascending to Dr. Caligari in the asylum.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} rolling waves and shots of palm tree-lined roads, and gulls. A posse of skateboarders are also pictured <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>scene.</b> At first, the clip appears to {{function}} in small, romantic gestures, reminiscent {{to that of a}} fashion magazine advertisement. The singer is pictured in two visually different love affairs. In the first, Del Rey is shown clinging to a younger, long-haired blond, leather-clad man on a beach, where she narcotically flits around the Pacific Ocean shorefront, and splashes in its waves with him. At the 1:20 mark, the song and its visuals simultaneously switch up, with the singer being pictured donning diamond jewelry, sitting alongside a more mature and svengali-type man who wears sunglasses, as a chauffeured convertible barrels forward in slow motion. Del Rey's love interest in this segment recalls age disparity in sexual relationships, producer Robert Evans, and Scott Weiland. In another scene, the two are depicted nuzzling and smoking {{in the back seat of}} the car. Del Rey depicts a woozy and solemn persona in these segments, while the pair caress each other under passing streetlights. The clip then returns to the scene of Del Rey and her younger love interest on the beach. The aforementioned segments are intercut with scenes that appear to be shot on a low-quality camcorder.|$|E
25|$|The Politician's Son depicts Rama (as Yuda) {{beating a}} politician's son at a night club which, {{in the final}} cut, was only {{mentioned}} {{as the reason for}} his imprisonment {{at the beginning of the}} film. Former MTV personality Daniel Mananta was seen <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>scene</b> as someone introducing Yuda to a 'boss'.|$|E
25|$|The Beats {{and some}} of the Black Mountain poets are often {{considered}} to have been responsible for the San Francisco Renaissance. However, as previously noted, San Francisco had become a hub of experimental activity from the 1930s thanks to Kenneth Rexroth and Gleason. Other poets involved <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>scene</b> included Charles Bukowski (1920–1994) and Jack Spicer (1925–1965). These poets sought to combine a contemporary spoken idiom with inventive formal experiment.|$|E

25|$|The Sacrifice of Isaac first {{appears in}} Christian art in 4th century depictions from the Roman catacombs and sarcophagi, {{as well as}} pieces like a {{fragment}} from a marble table from Cyprus. Abraham is restrained by the hand, which in the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus grasped his knife hand, as the angel often does in other depictions. However the angel mentioned in the biblical text is more usual, and often included as well. The use of the hand <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>scene,</b> at least in Christian art, indicates God's acceptance of the sacrifice, {{as well as his}} intervention to change it.|$|E
25|$|The {{clothing}} West depicted <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>scene</b> {{was highly}} controversial at the time. Although {{the event was}} relatively recent—only eleven years prior—its subject matter made it a fitting example of the genre of history painting, for which contemporary dress was unsuitable. During the painting, several influential people, including Sir Joshua Reynolds, instructed him to dress the figures in classical attire, and after its completion, George III refused to purchase it because the contemporary clothing compromised {{the dignity of the}} event. The work, however, eventually overcame all objections and helped inaugurate more historically accurate practice in history painting.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>scene,</b> Mussorgsky is hailed to {{be ahead}} of his time musically. His use of the whole tone scale, which uses only whole steps, made the Coronation scene stand out. This {{technique}} was replicated by impressionistic composers about 20 years later who noted his success. Mussorgsky also combined different two-beat and three-beat meters to create a unique sound for his composition called polymeters. These techniques were uncommon during this era and were believed to be almost too overwhelming for the public. This led to his rejection on two different occasions by the Imperial Opera before they decided to perform.|$|E

25|$|Frieze A {{originally}} depicted Domitian as {{he prepared}} to depart for a campaign against the Chatti. Contemporary authors such as Suetonius later alleged that Domitian's military endeavours were largely a failure, motivated by a quest for personal glory rather than necessity. The scene depicted on Frieze A seems to counter such accusations by presenting Domitian as a reluctant general, spurred on by the Gods Mars, Minerva and Roma, who are pictured on the far left, to defend his home country. Other characters who appear <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>scene</b> are the Genii, or guardian spirits, of the Roman Senate and the people of Rome, and a number of soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Kakuju, {{discovering}} her daughter's body, {{and realizing}} what has happened, attacks and stabs Tarō. The real escort then arrives for Kan Shōjō, learns that the minister already {{left in a}} different palanquin, and prepares to set off to find him. Just then, the false escort returns, having realized he had been tricked with a wooden statue of the minister; several times <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>scene,</b> Kan Shōjō demonstrates the mysterious ability to transform into, or otherwise replace himself with, a wooden statue. He emerges from the palanquin, and the false escort is arrested and Hyōe executed, before the minister leaves with the real escort, to a tearful farewell, bound for his exile in Dazaifu.|$|E
25|$|The third {{scene of}} Act IV, Terakoya ("Temple School") {{is among the}} most popular, and most {{frequently}} performed, scenes in the play. It takes place at the provincial school run by Genzō and Tonami, where they are watching over the young Kan Shūsai. Shihei suspects that this is where the minister's son is being hidden, and sends Matsuōmaru there to kill the boy and return with his head; among all of Shihei's retainers, only Matsuōmaru is trusted to identify the boy's head. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>scene,</b> Matsuōmaru is dressed in a dark kimono with snow and pine motifs, his hair wild and busy, a sign of the tragedy which is to come, and of the illness which he claims in order to quit Shihei's service.|$|E

25|$|In Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Voldemort's manifestation is as {{a face on}} {{the back}} of Quirrell's head, an effect {{achieved}} by computer generated imagery. Ian Hart, the actor who played Quirrell in the same film, provided the voice and the facial source for this character. Voldemort also appears in a scene in the Forbidden Forest where he is seen drinking the blood of a unicorn. As Voldemort's face was altered enough by CG work, and Hart's voice was affected enough, there was no confusion by Hart's playing of the two roles. In that film, he was also shown in a flashback sequence {{when he arrived at the}} home of James and Lily Potter to kill them. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>scene</b> Voldemort is played by Richard Bremmer, though his face is never seen. His next appearance would be in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets as the 16-year-old Tom Marvolo Riddle (portrayed by Christian Coulson).|$|E
25|$|As {{the second}} verse begins, the singer {{is seen in}} an African hut lying on the floor, {{surrounded}} by female dancers. She performs on the floor, in one moment managing to put her leg over her head, before standing up and again, performing a dance routine. The performers are seen to make {{the shape of an}} eye, with Rihanna in the centre as the pupil. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>scene</b> she wears a black lace ensemble with a new wild curly hairstyle. This is followed with the singer lying in a large birds' nest and then goes back to the singer with her previous wild hairstyle, performing a complex dance routine with female dancers, this time with fluorescent green effects. The penultimate scene shows Rihanna in a long dress which lights up neon red, while the singer has sequins across her face. She then appears to channel Hindu god Shiva as multiple arms surround her body. In the final scene, Rihanna and her male background dancers seen previously, slowly descend back underwater into the swamp; Rihanna's head completely submerges below the water.|$|E
25|$|The video {{depicts the}} Yojiro Noda at night {{time in a}} playground, as he pushes a girl with a {{blindfold}} and headphones in a wheelchair through the park. The girl holds a flash light as they move. Through the park, the pair pass a facially deformed man and men who are fighting. Further through the park is a makeshift slum, where they pas a man on fire. The sky begins to dawn, and the people around Noda and the girl are shot. A man sets a car on fire, and is later shot down {{by a group of}} men with guns. Near the end of the song, the pair come up to a pile of bodies and severed limbs, along with people crying over their bodies. The rest of the band members perform the song <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>scene.</b> Noda leaves the girl to close the eyes of a dead boy, and covers him with his jacket. The girl gets up from her wheelchair, and drops her flash light. She screams, removing her headphones and blindfold to reveal that her eyes have been sewn shut.|$|E

500|$|In {{original}} {{performances of}} A Midsummer Night's Dream, {{the actor who}} played Egeus and the actor who played Philostrate were probably one and the same. This can be gathered through discrepancies between the First Folio and earlier quarto versions of the play. In Act V, scene 1, for example, the quartos say [...] "Call Philostrate" [...] in several places where the 1623 Folio says [...] "Call Egeus". This would be an easy mistake to make if one actor had spoken both parts <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>scene.</b> One actor filling both roles explains the jumbled dialogue <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>scene.</b> Howard Furness, editor of several Shakespeare editions, interprets this a little differently, saying that Shakespeare may not have originally intended both roles to be played by the same person, but that directors combined the roles to save money. In any case, Act V, scene 1 is the only scene in which both men are present at the same time. In cases where one actor was playing both roles, Egeus' character would probably have filled both roles <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>scene,</b> absorbing Philostrate's lines into his own.|$|E
