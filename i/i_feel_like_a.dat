500|$|The play {{received}} overwhelmingly negative reviews, {{although some}} critics had minor compliments for Bara. Biographer Eve Golden described the reviews of Bara's acting as [...] "nothing less than vicious", but the commentary about the {{play as a}} whole was even more negative. Variety expected Bara to draw audiences to the theater for at least a few weeks, but said opinions in the daily press were united about how bad the play was. In The New York Times, Alexander Woollcott mocked the dialogue, which included lines such as, [...] "Have you brought the cocaine?" [...] and [...] "You make my heart laugh and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> woman of the streets." [...] Delivered seriously, this dialog drew laughter from the audience. Woollcott highlighted one particular line: [...] "I'm going to be so bad, I'll be remembered always." [...] He said Bara was bad, but not bad enough to be memorable. He credited her for speaking clearly and for not losing her composure when the audience laughed at her. Other reviewers gave Bara similarly faint praise: she had [...] "average competence" [...] or [...] "was not so bad". Some complimented her looks or her glamorous wardrobe.|$|E
