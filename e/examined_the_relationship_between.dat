5|$|The {{research}} Fischbach {{conducted at}} Columbia University stemmed from his previous work at Harvard University, Washington University {{and with the}} National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institute of Health. The specialized focus of his research was on the influence trophic factors could have on the survival of nerve cells and the efficiency of synapses. After his arrival to Columbia, Fischbach {{was focused on the}} expression of neuregulin in regards to neuromuscular synapses, signaling pathways in the brain, transcription factors, as well as work on autism. His research on Neuregulin-1 revealed a possible function in CNS neurogenesis since the neuregulins were labeled throughout proliferation with an anti-MAP2 antibody and an anti-nestin antibody were suggested to have become neuron-restricted progenitors. Some of his other research <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> neuregulin and expression of myosin heavy chain and transcription factors in human muscle. The research found that treatment including neuregulin increased the number of acetylcholine receptors {{on the surface of the}} myotube as well as an increase in the early growth response family for transcription factors. These findings impact the available knowledge regarding muscle spindle fiber formation, myosin heavy chains development, and the feasibility of mimicking muscle development processes in vitro.|$|E

40|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{empirical}} research that <b>examines</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> corporate board structure and performance.

25|$|Other {{researchers}} have investigated {{to what extent}} these behavioral economic lab experiments on social preferences can be generalized to behavior in the field. In a 2011 study, Fehr and Leibbrandt <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> contributions in public goods games to participation in public goods {{in the community of}} shrimpers in Brazil. These shrimpers cut a hole in the bottom of their fishing bucket in order to allow immature shrimp to escape, thereby investing in the public good of the shared shrimp population. The size of the hole {{can be seen as the}} degree to which participants cooperate, as larger holes allow more shrimp to escape. Controlling for a number of other possible influences, Fehr and Leibbrandt demonstrated a positive relationship between hole size and contributions in the public goods game experiment.|$|E
500|$|Early in 1975 Manning began The Danger Tree, {{which for}} a time she {{described}} as [...] "The Fourth Part of the Balkan Trilogy"; in the event, it became the first novel in The Levant Trilogy, continuing {{the story of the}} Pringles in the Middle East. The first book proved [...] "a long struggle" [...] to write, in part because of Manning's lack of confidence in her powers of invention: the book juxtaposes the Desert War experiences of a young officer, Simon Boulderstone, with the securer lives of the Pringles and their circle. [...] Manning, fascinated by sibling relationships, and remembering the death of her own brother, also <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> Simon and his elder brother, Hugo. She felt inadequate in her ability to write about soldiers and military scenes; initial reviewers agreed, finding her writing unconvincing and improbable, though subsequent reviewers have been considerably kinder.|$|E
500|$|As {{part of a}} study {{measuring}} the impact {{that the practice of}} clearfelling has on biodiversity in the Weld Valley of Tasmania, it was found that A.latipennis {{was one of the few}} species that thrived in regrowth forests that were previously clearfelled. [...] An earlier study, conducted in other regions of southern Tasmania, <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> the moth and Eucalyptus regnans and E.obliqua and reached the same conclusion. [...] The tunnelling and feeding habit of A.latipennis larvae on the roots of these two eucalypt species is mostly responsible for its abundance in clearfelled forests, as the trees are the typical regrowth of logged areas. [...] This success may also be due in part to the caterpillar's lack of dependence on decaying vegetation, a characteristic of the Abantiades genus and dissimilar to other Tasmanian genera—such as Eudonia and Barea—that have not fared as well in clearfelled forest.|$|E

500|$|Some {{analyses}} have <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> Marco and his father. Alison Lurie {{asserts that}} Marco's factual reply {{to his father}} {{at the end of}} the story says that [...] "it is sometimes, perhaps always, best to conceal one's inner imaginative life from adults", a message that appears again in The Cat in the Hat. [...] To Matthew Pierlot, [...] "The father serves as an external check on the boy's tendency to abandon the truth", a Socrates-like figure who insists on intellectual integrity and thwarts Marco's desire to mold mundane reality into something more exciting than it is. [...] To Patrick Shannon, [...] "Marco escapes into his imagination to combat the insipid character and conformity of the adult world". [...] In this sense the book follows an individualist, child-centered trend in children's literature beginning in the mid-20th century, also seen in the works of Maurice Sendak and William Steig; this is in contrast to the norm in earlier children's books where the author tried to impart outside values on the child reader.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between diet and acne is unclear, {{as there is}} no high-quality evidence that establishes any definitive link between them. High-glycemic-load diets have been found to have different degrees of effect on acne severity. Multiple randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized studies have found a lower-glycemic-load diet to be effective in reducing acne. There is weak observational evidence suggesting that dairy milk consumption is positively associated with a higher frequency and severity of acne. Milk contains whey protein and hormones such as bovine IGF-1 and precursors of dihydrotestosterone. These components are hypothesized to promote the effects of insulin and IGF-1 and thereby [...] increase the production of androgen hormones, sebum, and promote the formation of comedones. [...] Effects from other potentially contributing dietary factors, such as consumption of chocolate or salt, are not supported by the evidence. Chocolate does contain varying amounts of sugar, which can lead to a high glycemic load, and it can be made with or without milk. Few studies have <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> obesity and acne. Vitamin B12 may trigger skin outbreaks similar to acne (acneiform eruptions), or worsen existing acne, when taken in doses exceeding the recommended daily intake.|$|E

2500|$|In his {{scholarly}} work Race, Rock, and Elvis, Tennessee State University professor Michael T.

Professor Bertrand postulated that Presley's rock and roll music brought an unprecedented access to African American culture that challenged the 1950s segregated generation to reassess ingrained segregationist stereotypes. The American Historical Review wrote that the author [...] "convincingly argues that the black-and-white character of the sound, as well as Presley's own persona, helped to relax the rigid color line and thereby fed the fires {{of the civil rights}} movement". The U.S. government report stated: [...] "Presley has been accused of [...] "stealing" [...] black rhythm and blues, but such accusations indicate little knowledge of his many musical influences." [...] "However much Elvis may have 'borrowed' from black blues performers (e.g., 'Big Boy' Crudup, 'Big Mama' Thornton), he borrowed no less from white country stars (e.g., Ernest Tubb, Bill Monroe) and white pop singers," [...] and most of his borrowings came from the church; its gospel music was his primary musical influence and foundation." ...|$|E

2500|$|Indian in the Sun (1981) {{was based}} on a short story by Israeli {{journalist}} and author Adam Baruch, with a script by Dita Guery (with Micha Levtov and Ram Loevy). In Playing Devils, Playing Angels, Loevy <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> affluent, urban Israelis and the [...] "Second Israel" [...] as a documentarian. In this film, he dramatized the conflicts and similarities between the two groups. The story revolves around Laufer (played by Doron Nesher), an Israeli soldier from the wealthy suburbs of northern Tel Aviv, who is ordered to accompany another soldier, known only as [...] "the Indian (played by Haim Gerafi)", to prison. [...] "The Indian" [...] was a dark-skinned Cochin Jew and a moshavnik (though Gerafi himself was an Ethiopian Jew), and the film highlights the patronizing attitude that Laufer has to his charge. Over time, however, and as the driver (played by Moshe Ivgy) watches, the two realize that they share a common enemy in the Establishment, and Laufer even offers to help the Indian escape. All the while, the driver watches in trepidation as two extremes of the Israeli social spectrum find that they have more in common than they thought, and begin to forge an alliance between them. The film won the Harp of David Award for the best Israeli television production of the year, as well as the Israeli Broadcasting Authority Award.|$|E
2500|$|Contemporary sociolinguistic {{studies suggest}} that styles are learned, rather than {{assigned}} {{at the time of}} birth. With that said, identities emerge in a time series of social practice, through the combined effects of structure and agency. Because social identities are not static, the speech community model, which was traditionally employed as a sociolinguistic framework in the study of language and gender, is not as reliable as the community of practice model, the new framework emerged from practice theory. Also because social identities are not static, speech styles are actively subject to change, such that one's speech styles have different social meanings across time. Similarly, it is possible for an individual to engage in multiple identity practices simultaneously, and move from one identity to another unconsciously and automatically, and thus the term polyphonous identity. Podesva (2004) is a paper that studies recordings of a gay medical student, whom he called [...] "Heath", as he moved through different situations {{in the course of his}} everyday life. The fact that Heath's pronunciation of the voiceless alveolar stop, /t/, varies when he deals with different groups of people suggest not only some of gay people's speech features, but also the multiplicity of a person's social identity. Furthermore, Podesva also <b>examined</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> <b>between</b> the California Vowel Shift (CVS) and the gay identity, again by investigating intra-speaker patterns in a single individual, Regan, as opposed to inter-speaker variation, and found that Regan, who is a self-identified gay Asian American, realized CVS differently depending on the context, whether it be a [...] "boys' night out," [...] "dinner with friend," [...] or [...] "meeting with supervisor". This cross-situational patterns are critical in the sense that an individual's speech styles can change not only across time, but also across space, depending on which social identity the individual is attempting to engage in under a given situation. Over-generalizations of social identity, however, overlook this intra-speaker variability.|$|E
