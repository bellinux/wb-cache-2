2500|$|Over {{the summer}} months, the track was resurfaced {{in an effort}} to reduce its {{bumpiness}} and the pit lane was re-profiled with the <b>entry</b> <b>brought</b> <b>forward</b> from the Arquibancadas corner to move it off the racing line and a chicane added to the pit lane to further slow cars entering the pit lane following a series of heavy accidents in national races. The pit lane exit was moved further away from the circuit to allow for a run-off area on the outside of turn two. In addition, in response to the incident suffered by Jules Bianchi during the Japanese Grand Prix, procedures relating to the location of a tractor crane serving the Senna [...] "S" [...] chicane were also altered. Pirelli originally nominated the orange-banded Hard and white-banded Medium tyres, as it has for the event since 2012. However, following the Russian Grand Prix one month prior, many drivers criticised the low level of grip and wear shown on the new tarmac of the Sochi Autodrom. Since the Autódromo José Carlos Pace was completely repaved, there was concern that the hard compound would be [...] "very dangerous". Along with unanimous agreement from all eleven teams, Pirelli ultimately decided to bring the Medium and yellow-banded Soft tyres to the event.|$|E
