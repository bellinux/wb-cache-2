25|$|The next {{feature to}} be {{discussed}} is the oval shaped curves representing islands of constant efficiency. In this figure we see 11 contours ranging from 56% efficiency (decimal 0.56) to 76% efficiency (decimal 0.76). General standard practice is to interpret these efficiencies as isentropic rather than polytropic. The inclusion of efficiency islands effectively generates a 3-dimensional topology to this 2-dimensional map. With inlet density specified, it provides a further ability to calculate aerodynamic power. Lines of constant power could <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> substituted.|$|E
25|$|This comment has {{traditionally}} caused commentators {{to conclude that}} Luke was a Gentile. If this were true, it would make Luke the only writer of the New Testament who can clearly be identified as not being Jewish. However, {{that is not the}} only possibility. Although Luke is considered likely to be a Gentile Christian, some scholars believe him to be a Hellenized Jew. The phrase could <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> used to differentiate between those Christians who strictly observed the rituals of Judaism and those who did not.|$|E
25|$|As {{its name}} suggests, a shophouse often {{contains}} a shop with separate residential spaces. More generally, space {{occupied by the}} former contains a semi-public function. While this usually is, and historically usually was, a shop, it could <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> a food and beverage outlet (e.g. coffeeshop or bar), a service provider (e.g. clinic or barber), an industrial activity (e.g. cottage industry or auto workshop) or a community space (e.g. a school or clan association). Residential spaces are meant to accommodate one or more families, or serve as a dormitory for single workers. Popular belief holds that shophouses were initially occupied by single families, with their private living areas in one space and the more public family business in another. However, {{it is possible that}} the two spaces were always usually used by unrelated persons or groups, who may be tenants or resident owners. The position of the shop and residential space depends on the number of floors of the shophouse: A single storey shophouse tends to include residential space behind the shop, while residential spaces in shophouses of two or more storeys are typically located above the shop.|$|E

500|$|During the 20th century, one {{illustration}} was repeatedly– and wrongly– {{published as}} [...] "Christopher Wren, {{design for the}} Theatre Royal Drury Lane, 1674". Since 1964, this presumption has been disputed by scholars. Careful inspection of the drawing at All Soul's Library shows that it has one pencil inscription: [...] "Play house" [...] , {{which may have been}} added by a librarian or by anyone else. No sign of a signature (by Wren or anyone else) or a date appears anywhere on the drawing. Robert D.

500|$|I, the Supreme (orig. Spanish Yo el supremo) is a {{historical}} novel written by exiled Paraguayan author Augusto Roa Bastos. It is a fictionalized account of the nineteenth-century Paraguayan dictator José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, who was also known as [...] "Dr. Francia." [...] The book's title derives {{from the fact that}} Francia referred to himself as [...] "El Supremo" [...] or [...] "the Supreme." [...] The first {{in a long line of}} dictators, the Supreme was a severe, calculating despot. [...] The central themes of the novel are power and language and the relation between the two. [...] The Supreme believes himself to be above all power and history: [...] "I don't write history. I make it. I can remake it as I please, adjusting, stressing, enriching its meaning and truth." [...] Yet this assertion is constantly challenged by the very fact that while he achieves power by means of writing and dictating, these very same methods can be used by others to dispute his authority. Not even his own identity, represented by the personal pronoun I, is safe and can easily be usurped as is demonstrated by the incident of the pasquinade. Language, as powerful as it is, can never be controlled and can <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> used as an instrument of coercion as an instrument of resistance.|$|E

[...] Scott Shetler of Pop Crush said that [...] "the crowd energy for the Britney cover didn't seem as high as when Swift covered Eminem in Detroit or Justin Bieber in Toronto." [...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV, however, praised the performance, and noted that the show's crowd gave a positive reaction to the cover, saying, [...] "though the video is sideways and features the amateur videographer's own personal sing-along, the excitement in her voice is a testament to Taylor's song choice. Or in other words, we can almost guarantee that every normal, living, breathing Louisiana-bred girl in attendance at Taylor's show is also obsessed with Britney Spears." [...] Becky Bain of Idolator said that she had no doubts that Swift would cover a Spears song, but was surprised that the song Swift chose was [...] "Lucky". PopDust writer Katherine St Asaph said that [...] "Lucky" [...] is [...] "one of the few Britney lyrics that could <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> written for/by Taylor {{and one of the few}} songs that wouldn’t need massive re-arranging." ...|$|E

5000|$|Asked by Anton Schindler why {{the work}} has only two {{movements}} (this was unusual for a classical sonata but not unique among Beethoven's works for piano), the composer {{is said to have}} replied [...] "I didn't have the time to write a third movement." [...] However, according to Robert Greenberg, this may have <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>been</b> the composer's prickly personality shining through, since the balance between the two movements is such that it obviates the need for a third. Jeremy Denk points out that Beethoven [...] "whittles away everything down to the absolute difference of the two movements", [...] "an Allegro and an Adagio, two opposed poles", and suggests that [...] "as with the greatest Beethoven pieces, the structure itself becomes a message".|$|R

2500|$|Apparently, another {{possible}} origin {{for the name}} comes from a film-clip excerpt from a CBC documentary on the NDP, taken during {{a meeting of the}} group some months prior to the October 1969 NDP Winnipeg convention.
