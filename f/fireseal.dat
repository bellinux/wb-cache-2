5000|$|Introduced in {{the first}} {{installment}} of the series (1998), Frederick {{was one of the}} lead scientists of the Gear project, as well as being the prototypical Gear, dating from over a hundred years before the events of the Guilty Gear games. As a prototype, he is immune to the orders of Commander Gears. He was personally acquainted with Asuka R. Kreuz (whom typically known as That Man) prior to the Crusades. As Frederick, Sol created the [...] "Outrage", which he called a supreme Anti-Gear weapon. The Outrage has eight components called [...] "Jinki" [...] (Godlike Weapons), which greatly amplify their wielders' magical ability. Later, he was himself recruited into the order, as a bounty hunter named Sol Badguy. Sol took part in the Crusades, during which {{he was a member of}} the Sacred Order of Holy Knights (Seikishidan), acquiring the nickname [...] "Flame of Corruption" [...] (Haitoku no Honō). However, he later became disenchanted with the methods of the Sacred Order, and fled the order, taking with him the Fūenken (<b>Fireseal).</b> The theft earned him Ky Kiske's enmity.|$|E
