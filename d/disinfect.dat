5|$|On September 5, {{the mayor}} of Hickman, Kentucky, a small western town along the Mississippi River, telegraphed {{the state board of}} health, informing them that yellow fever had reached {{epidemic}} levels in the city and requesting that Blackburn be sent to them as soon as possible. Blackburn arrived on September 7 to find that roughly 20 percent of the town's population were ill with yellow fever. He organized cleanup crews to <b>disinfect</b> the town and a squad of Negroes to guard vacated homes. In late September, when it appeared the Hickman epidemic was waning, Blackburn traveled to Chattanooga and Martin, Tennessee, to render aid, but within ten days, he received word that the outbreak in Hickman had resurged and spread to nearby Fulton, Kentucky. Blackburn returned to the area and continued his ministrations until late October, when the outbreak had fully subsided.|$|E
5|$|Photochromic lenses include silver halides, so that {{ultraviolet}} light in natural daylight liberates metallic silver, darkening the lenses. The silver halides are reformed in lower light intensities. Colourless silver chloride films {{are used in}} radiation detectors. Zeolite sieves incorporating Ag+ ions are used to desalinate seawater during rescues, using silver ions to precipitate chloride as silver chloride. Silver is also used for its antibacterial properties for water sanitisation, but the application of this is limited by limits on silver consumption. Colloidal silver is similarly used to <b>disinfect</b> closed swimming pools; while it {{has the advantage of}} not giving off a smell like hypochlorite treatments do, colloidal silver is not effective enough for more contaminated open swimming pools. Small silver iodide crystals are used in cloud seeding to cause rain.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Nevinson joined the Friends' Ambulance Unit, which his father had helped to found. From 13 November 1914, Nevinson spent nine weeks in France with the FAU and the British Red Cross Society, mostly working at a disused goods shed by Dunkirk rail station known as the Shambles. The Shambles housed some three thousand badly wounded French troops, who had been evacuated from the Front and then all but abandoned. For weeks they had been left unfed and untended with the dead and dying lying together on dirty straw. Nevinson, alongside his father and other volunteers, worked to dress wounds, help clean and <b>disinfect</b> the shed and started to make it habitable. Nevinson later depicted his experiences in The Shambles in two paintings, The Doctor and La Patrie. As the French authorities began {{to take control of}} the situation, Nevinson was reassigned as an ambulance driver. Although Nevinson would often make much of this time as an ambulance driver, particularly in his publicity material, he only held the role for a week as, due to his poor health, he lacked the strength to steer the vehicle. By January 1915 his worsening rheumatism had made him unfit for further service and he returned to Britain.|$|E

5|$|The floodwaters {{from the}} {{hurricane}} combined with raw sewage in many poor areas of southwestern Mexico, {{leading to a}} widespread threat for a spread of tropical diseases. As a result, government health workers opened vaccination centers in several cities along the Guerrero and Oaxaca coasts. Thousands were inoculated for typhoid fever and tetanus. Officials noted a potential threat for dengue and cholera {{as a result of}} the spoiled water. Health workers also stated mosquitos possessing malaria and dengue fever were likely to breed in large areas of leftover water. In Acapulco, about two days after the hurricane passed, the first day of sun in a week evaporated the areas of leftover water, spreading dust across the region with the deadly diseases. Residents were warned to boil their food and water for 30minutes due to the threat for contamination by the dust. At least twenty cases of cholera and at least six cases of dengue fever were reported. Most significantly, there were 14,630cases of malaria in 616villages in Oaxaca due to Pauline; this represented about 80% of the malaria cases in Mexico during 1998. Army soldiers distributed chlorine tablets to <b>disinfect</b> water pools and wheelbarrows to remove rotting mud and sewage from their damaged homes. Two C-130 Hercules planes and twenty helicopters airlifted food and water to smaller villages south of Acapulco that were stranded for nearly a week after the hurricane.|$|E

40|$|Acanthamoeba cysts {{are highly}} {{resistant}} to contact lens <b>disinfecting</b> solutions. Acanthamoeba cyst wall is partially made of 1, 4 β-glucan (i. e., cellulose) and other complex polysaccharides {{making it a}} hardy shell that protects the resident amoeba. Here, we hypothesize that targeting the cyst wall structure in addition to antiamoebic compound would improve the efficacy of marketed contact lens <b>disinfecting</b> solutions. Using chlorhexidine as an antiamoebic compound and cellulase enzyme to disrupt cyst wall structure, the findings revealed that combination of both agents abolished viability of Acanthamoeba castellanii cysts and trophozoites. When tested alone, none of the agents nor contact lens <b>disinfecting</b> solutions completely destroyed A. castellanii cysts and trophozoites. The absence of cyst wall-degrading enzymes in marketed contact lens <b>disinfecting</b> solutions render them ineffective against Acanthamoeba cysts. It is concluded that the addition of cyst wall degrading molecules in contact lens <b>disinfecting</b> solutions will enhance their efficacy in decreasing the incidence of Acanthamoeba effectively...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{multipurpose}} {{solutions for}} cleaning and <b>disinfecting</b> rigid gas permeable lenses has replaced single purpose solutions, {{but there are}} no reports of the efficacy of these multipurpose solutions, or of the effects of storage conditions on their <b>disinfecting</b> capacities. This study investigated activity against four bacterial and two fungal species, and the effects of storage in a refrigerator, at room temperature, at elevated temperature in both dry and humid conditions and with exposure to sunlight. The <b>disinfecting</b> solutions were challenged with the micro-organisms initially upon opening and then at 2 -weekly intervals up to 12 weeks after being stored under the different conditions. Solutions were opened daily to simulate use. One solution failed to meet Food and Drug Administration (FDA) criteria to reduce numbers of bacteria by three log dilutions and of fungi by one log dilution. Storage reduced activity of all solutions over the 12 -week period, but not below the requirements of the FDA. Storage in the refrigerator tended to reduce <b>disinfecting</b> capacity more quickly. Multipurpose solutions for rigid gas permeable (RGP) lenses lose activity over the 3 months recommended time of use but remain satisfactory for use over this time in the conditions tested. Practitioners need to remind patients to replace their solutions regularly and should advise against storage in the refrigerator. Multipurpose solutions for RGP lenses have simplified cleaning and <b>disinfecting</b> processes and the current formulations have improved <b>disinfecting</b> capacity compared to former <b>disinfecting</b> solutions, which is particularly important for wearers of orthokeratology lenses.

40|$|Marked {{bactericidal}} {{activity of}} the electrolyzed acid water (EAW) and its less undesirable effects on biological tissues and the environment has been successfully utilized in dental practice. A review of literature reveals that not many studies have been performed to determine the disinfection effect of EAW on heat cured acrylic denture bases. The objective {{of the study is}} to determine the efficacy of EAW in <b>disinfecting</b> heat cured acrylic resin specimens as compared to the efficacy of <b>disinfecting</b> the specimens using 2 % glutaraldehyde. Heat cured acrylic resin plates were immersed in Bacteria suspensions of Staphylococcus aureus and later <b>disinfected</b> using EAW which was produced using a custom made electrolyzing apparatus and 2 % glutaraldehyde for different time intervals. The numbers of surviving bacteria were counted. As the control, the bacteria attached on the specimens were counted with out any disinfection treatment. The results obtained were statistically analyzed using ANOVA and post-hoc test. The disinfection potential of 2 % glutaraldehyde was better than EAW when the specimens were <b>disinfected</b> for 1 and 3  min. Where as when the disinfection time was increased to 5  min {{there was no difference between}} EAW and 2 % glutaraldehyde.

50|$|Disinfection is {{accomplished}} both by filtering out harmful micro-organisms {{and also by}} adding disinfectant chemicals. Water is <b>disinfected</b> to kill any pathogens which pass through the filters {{and to provide a}} residual dose of disinfectant to kill or inactivate potentially harmful micro-organisms in the storage and distribution systems. Possible pathogens include viruses, bacteria, including Salmonella, Cholera, Campylobacter and Shigella, and protozoa, including Giardia lamblia and other cryptosporidia. Following the introduction of any chemical <b>disinfecting</b> agent, the water is usually held in temporary storage - often called a contact tank or clear well to allow the <b>disinfecting</b> action to complete.|$|R
