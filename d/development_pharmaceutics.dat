40|$|Molecular {{modeling}} {{techniques have}} been widely used in drug discovery fields for rational drug design and compound screening. Now these techniques are used to model or mimic the behavior of molecules, and help us study formulation at the molecular level. Computational pharmaceutics enables us to understand the mechanism of drug delivery, and to develop new drug delivery systems. The book discusses the modeling of different drug delivery systems, including cyclodextrins, solid dispersions, polymorphism prediction, dendrimer-based delivery systems, surfactant-based micelle, polymeric drug delivery systems, liposome, protein/peptide formulations, non-viral gene delivery systems, drug-protein binding, silica nanoparticles, carbon nanotube-based drug delivery systems, diamond nanoparticles and layered double hydroxides (LDHs) drug delivery systems. Although {{there are a number of}} existing books about rational drug design with molecular modeling techniques, these techniques still look mysterious and daunting for pharmaceutical scientists. This book fills the gap between pharmaceutics and molecular modeling, and presents a systematic and overall introduction to computational pharmaceutics. It covers all introductory, advanced and specialist levels. It provides a totally different perspective to pharmaceutical scientists, and will greatly facilitate the <b>development</b> of <b>pharmaceutics.</b> It also helps computational chemists to look for the important questions in the drug delivery field...|$|R
40|$|Transglutaminase 2 (TGase 2) is a ubiquitously {{expressed}} {{enzyme that}} catalyzes irreversible post-translational modification of protein, forming cross-linked protein aggregates. We previously reported that intracellular TGase 2 is activated by oxidative stress. To elucidate the functional role of TGase 2 activation in cells under the oxidatively stressed condition, we identified the mediator that activates TGase 2. In this study, {{we showed that}} low levels of oxidative stress trigger the release of TGF beta, which subsequently activates TGase 2 through the nuclear translocation of Smad 3. Analysis of substrate proteins reveals that TGase 2 -mediated protein modification results in a decrease of protein solubility and a collapse of intermediate filament network, which leads to aggregation of proteins. We confirm these results using lens tissues from TGase 2 -deficient mice. Among several antioxidants tried, only N-acetylcysteine effectively inhibits TGF beta-mediated activation of TGase 2. These results indicate that TGF beta mediates oxidative stress-induced protein aggregation through activation of TGase 2 and suggest that the formation of protein aggregation {{may not be a}} passive process of self-assembly of oxidatively damaged proteins but may be an active cellular response to oxidative stress. Therefore, TGF beta-TGase 2 pathway may have implications for both the pathogenesis of age-related degenerative diseases and the <b>development</b> of <b>pharmaceutics...</b>|$|R
40|$|Liquid Chromatography (LC) and Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) are modern {{analytical}} {{techniques that}} play very {{important roles in}} many areas of modern science such as life science, biotechnology, biomedicine, environmental studies, and <b>development</b> of <b>pharmaceutics.</b> Even though these two techniques have existed and been subjected to studies for several decades, the developments of new separation materials for them are still very important till now {{in order to meet the}} different new demands for improvement from other disciplines in science. In this doctoral thesis, several novel covalently bonded sulfobetaine type zwitterionic separation materials are synthesized for the application in LC and CE. These materials carry both positively charged quaternary ammonium groups and negatively charged sulfonic groups, which result in a very low net surface charge compared to conventional separation materials with only anionic or cationic functional groups. Consequently, it is possible to employ these materials for separation of different ionic species under mild conditions. The surface properties have also been characterized, mainly by elemental analysis, sorption isotherm, ζ-potential measurements, and spectroscopic methods. By using packed zwitterionic columns for liquid chromatography, small inorganic anions or cations, and acidic or basic proteins can be independently and simultaneously separated in a single run using optimal sets of separation conditions. This is a unique property compared to conventional ionic separation material for LC. When fused silica capillaries coated with zwitterionic polymer are used for capillary electrophoresis, good separations can be achieved for solutes as different as inorganic anions, peptides, proteins, and tryptically digested proteins...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT- Purpose. Lutein is a {{carotenoid}} mainly {{found in}} green leafy vegetables and {{is located in}} the macula lutea in the human eye. It has received much attention recently due to its preventive effect on age-related macular degeneration, and it has been consumed as a supplement. However, little information about the pharmacokinetic properties of lutein is available. Detailed knowledge of pharmacokinetic properties of lutein is needed for the <b>development</b> of <b>pharmaceutics.</b> In this study, we focused on the macular accumulation of lutein and investigated the uptake mechanism into human retinal pigment epithelial cells. Methods. ARPE- 19 cells were used for the study on the accumulation mechanism of lutein. The concentration of lutein was determined using an HPLC system. Involvement of scavenger class B type 1 (SR-B 1) in the accumulation of lutein in ARPE- 19 cells was suggested from the results of an inhibition study using block lipid transport 1 (BLT- 1), a selective inhibitor of SR-B 1. To investigate the involvement of SR-B 1 in more detail, small interfering RNA (siRNA) was transfected and the mRNA and protein expression levels of SR-B 1 were assessed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, respectively. Results. We confirmed a sufficient siRNA knockdown effect in both mRNA and protein expression levels of SR-B 1. We then found that lutein uptake was significantly decreased by siRNA knockdown of SR-B 1. Conclusion. The uptake of lutein was significantly decreased by 40 % compared with the control uptake level. This suggested that active transport of lutein into ARPE- 19 cells is mainly via SR-B 1, given the result that lutein uptake at 4 ºC was about 40 % less that that at 37 ºC.

While choosing the optimal labeling method for visualizing the carrier or its cargo is crucial, densities alter the intracellular processing of the molecule is it seldom receives attention. The possibility that high labeling considered, but how and {{at which point}} this interference happens is not yet studied. The {{aim of this study}} was to elucidate the effect of labeling density on the cellular trafficking of labeled pDNA. Due to the drastic effect on expression levels for higher labeling densities, we tried to determine at which steps in the intracellular processing labeled pDNA behaves different than its nonlabeled counterpart. Therefore, different labeling densities, up to the manufacturer's recommended density, were tested. It was found that the cellular uptake remains unaffected, while the affinity for lipids is increased, which affects dissociation from the lipid-based complex and may affect endosomal escape. Also, nuclear injections clearly demonstrated that transcription is affected. The information and methodology, included in this work, could be helpful in determining if the labeling method and density used yields biological relevant results for the intended research question...|$|R
