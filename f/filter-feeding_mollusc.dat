All four species showed a decreasing pattern of muscle δ 13 C and δ 15 N values with increasing depth. At the Ushant front (∼ 130 m water depth), {{where there is a}} decrease in both bottom water chlorophyll a and suspended particulate matter, muscle δ 13 C and δ 15 N values decreased in all species. Although δ 13 C values of infaunal clams initially decreased at 30 m depth, δ 13 C values of epifaunal scallops decreased around 120 m depth, far below the expected depth reduction in microphytobenthic production suggesting that carbon isotopes might not simply track microphytobenthic utilization. The difference between infaunal and epifaunal bivalve stable isotope values may reflect differences in feeding strategies. Muscle δ 15 N values at the deepest stations (∼ 2 ‰) were lower than expected considering the typical trophic enrichment value of 3 - 4 ‰ between prey and consumers. These low δ 15 N values may result from low metabolic rates and suggest the classic trophic enrichment may not hold true in species inhabiting deep waters. Stable isotopes in benthic filter feeders can reveal much information regarding their ecology and environment, but are not straightforward recorders of stable isotope baseline variations as is often assumed...|$|E

40|$|Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) are {{chemical}} substances that {{persist in the}} environment for long time since they are resistant to chemical, biological, and photolytic degradation, are long-range transported because they are semi-volatile, bioaccumulate in organisms due to their lipophilicity and have potential adverse effects on wildlife and human health. Starting from {{the first half of}} the last century, POPs have been developed and used in a wide range of products and they have been released in the environment through combustion. In the present PhD thesis, attention was posed to some “old generation POPs”: commercial mixtures of PCBs (PolyChlorinated Biphenyls), used as dielectric and hydraulic fluids, and some pesticides and their isomers/metabolites: DDTs (DichloroDiphenylTrichloroethane), HCHs (HexaChlorocycloHexanes) and HCB (HexaChloroBenzene). In the past century, million of tons of these chemicals were released into the environment. Nowadays, their use is banned in many areas of the world, including Italy, even if in certain countries, like in Africa for example, DDT is still widely used to fight against malaria vectors. Lake and marine sediments or the ice of remote areas are important POPs reservoirs which can be considered “chemical time-bombs” since they are not watertight environment and unexpected events can cause POP release with a boomerang effect. The present work was aimed at clarifying some aspects of POP bioaccumulation in the aquatic trophic webs. Although these compounds have been studied a lot in the last decades, there are still some open topics to understand the fate of these pollutants in real ecosystems. Many empirical and mechanistic models of different complexity have been developed since the ‘ 60 s, in order to predict the fate of POPs and their potential for bioaccumulation in the aquatic food webs. However, some problems arise when filed data are used to verify these theoretical models. In this thesis, a bioenergetic steady-state model was applied to the pelagic trophic web of Lake Maggiore, one of the largest and deepest Italian lakes characterized by DDT contamination of industrial origin until 1996. In particular, the seasonal and spatial variability of water concentration and the role of zooplankton in the transfer of POPs were investigated. With this aim, water, zooplankton and fishes of Lake Maggiore were analysed for the determination of DDT content. Although DDT contamination along the water column became rather homogeneous starting from 2007, the hypothesis of a steady-state condition was rejected, probably due to the algal production. An apparent thermodynamic paradox was then found since zooplankton showed DDT concentrations and bioaccumulation factors on lipid basis (BAFL) higher than fishes. Beyond the uncertainty of the Log Kow values, the underestimation of bacteria and phytoplankton capability to bioconcentrate POPs and/or the underestimation of the trophic level of zooplankton, food consumption rates and other kinetic parameters were taken into account to explain the findings of this study. Moreover, the zooplankton species might be more endangered by POPs than predicted by the steady-state model. Concerning Italian deep subalpine lakes, other factors can obstacle the occurrence of a steady-state condition. The influence of secondary pollution sources was tested on two glacier-fed lakes (Como and Iseo), starting from the monitoring of a littoral <b>filter-feeding</b> <b>mollusc</b> (Dreissena polymorpha) and a pelagic fish species (Alosa fallax lacustris). In spite of the Italian DDT ban in 1978, in 2005 a large DDT contamination caused very high concentration in both monitored species. A plausible explanation for this phenomenon was that DDT, widely used from 1950 s to 1970 s for fruit treatment in valleys just below the glaciers, was trapped in the ice and then was released in the last 2 years as a consequence of the ice melting during the recent glacier retreat. In mussels, levels 150 times higher than those recorded before caused a degeneration of the reproductive apparatus, while concentrations in fish were of concern for human consumption. With the aim of confirming high-altitude glacier melting as the source of the secondary pollution by DDT, past and present contamination was reconstructed by the analyses of POPs stored in a sediment core collected in 2008 in an undisturbed deposition area of Lake Iseo. As expected, it was observed that DDT concentrations sharply increased starting from the mid ninety with a contamination peak in 2005, probably ascribed to the complete overturn of the lake. On the contrary of DDTs, PCBs showed different accumulation profile indicating that these pollutants reached the lake from different pollution sources. Since sediments can not be considered a watertight compartment their role as secondary pollution source can not be ignored. Within the national PRIN project “An Integrated Approach to the Conservation and Management of the European Eel in the Mediterranean Region”, POP contamination in European eel (Anguilla anguilla), a critically endangered species prone to POP bioaccumulation, was evaluated in order to understand the possible causes of its decline. POP bioaccumulation in eel poses concern even for human health because of its commercial importance and its wide distribution in Europe. The POP analysis of eels caught in three Italian coastal waters (Tevere River, Lesina Lagoon and Caprolace Lake) showed a high pollution variability within each subpopulation. Nevertheless, it was clear that Tevere eels were much more polluted by POPs with an industrial origin than the others collected in two coastal lagoons. As concern the risk for eel, levels of dioxine-like PCBs that could cause embryo fish mortality, were found in the river eels, also infested by the exotic swimbladder nematode Anguillicoloides crassus, which could jeopardize their swimming ability. Moreover, in eels collected in the Tevere River gonad alterations not directly related to POP contamination or to parasites were observed. The very low lipid contents measured in some Caprolace eels, probably due to the scarce food availability, could be the cause of an unsuccessful migration to the spawning site. The main conclusions of this study were that eel contamination by POPs seems to be of great concern for the survival both of this species and of its predators and, therefore, for the human consumption. The suitability of Anguilla anguilla as bioaccumulator species for POPs monitoring in European water bodies was also considered indicating the suitability of eels as bioindicators in brackish environments and rivers, with particular attention to the physiological condition of the fish. In the end the occurrence of DDT in equatorial African lakes, notable for the conservation of the endangered lesser flamingos (Phoeniconaias minor), was investigated. The monitoring of DDT pollution was carried out on sediments to evaluate the potential exposition. In spite of the residual usage of DDT in equatorial Africa to fight malaria, the remote areas of lakes Natron and Bogoria in the Rift Valley region were poorly affected by this kind of pollution...|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} of toxic secondary metabolites by marine phytoplankton and their accumulation in molluscs and fish has ecosystem-wide {{and human health}} impacts. The potent neurotoxin saxitoxin and its analogs, which can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning, are produced by species of the dinoflagellate genus Alexandrium. These toxins can accumulate in <b>filter-feeding</b> <b>molluscs,</b> including commercially grown species of shellfish. A feeding experiment was designed to assess the use of quantitative polymerase chain reaction to detect a gene involved in saxitoxin biosynthesis (sxtA) in two commercial oyster stocks.

A barcoding gene specific to Alexandrium (ITS 5. 8 s rRNA) and the sxtA gene, domain 4, which is specific to the saxitoxin synthesis pathway, were assayed.

40|$|<b>Filter-feeding</b> <b>molluscs</b> like mussels {{are often}} the organisms of choice for marine {{pollution}} impact assessment as they store organic waste and heavy metals in the tissues and in the shell that are transiently or permanently present in their environment. The fluorescent age pigment lipofuscin is a waste material of detoxifying processes and predominantly accumulates in the lysosomes. Lipofuscin is also a recognized hallmark of aging as it accumulates with age, presumably caused by ongoing cellular oxidative stress. The ocean quahog Arctica islandica is the longest-lived of all molluscan species. The reported maximum life span for an Iceland population is > 300 yrs. The accumulation of the biochemical age marker lipofuscin and the change in protein oxidation with age was studied in mantle, gill and adductor muscle of A. islandica. Sample material comprised an age range from 5 to 192 years. In mantle and gill tissue the lipofuscin concentration increased with age. In muscle tissue lipofuscin was not visible at any age. The protein carbonyl content was constant with age in mantle and gill. In contrast to lipofuscin, protein carbonyls can {{be removed from the}} cell. This may lead to the observed differences in accumulation of both molecules in the tissue.

40|$|We {{describe}} a novel biotope at 633 to 762 m depth on a vertical {{wall in the}} Whittard Canyon, an extensive canyon system reaching from the shelf to the deep sea on Ireland's continental margin. We explored this wall with an ROV and compiled a photomosaic of the habitat. The assemblage contributing to the biotope was dominated by large limid bivalves, Acesta excavata (mean shell height 10. 4 cm), and deep-sea oysters, Neopycnodonte zibrowii, at high densities, particularly at overhangs. Mean density of N. zibrowii increased with depth, with densities of the most closely packed areas of A. excavata also increasing with depth. Other taxa associated with the assemblage included the solitary coral Desmophyllum dianthus, cerianthid anemones, comatulid crinoids, the trochid gastropod Margarites sp., the portunid crab Bathynectes longispina and small fish of the family Bythitidae. The scleractinian coral Madrepora oculata, the pencil urchin Cidaris cidaris and a species of Epizoanthus were also common. Prominent but less abundant species included the flytrap anemone Actinoscyphia saginata, the carrier crab Paramola cuvieri, and the fishes Lepidion eques and Conger conger. Observations of the hydrography of the canyon system identified that the upper 500 m was dominated by Eastern North Atlantic Water, with Mediterranean Outflow Water beneath it. The permanent thermocline is found between 600 and 1000 m depth, i. e., in the depth range of the vertical wall and the dense assemblage of filter feeders.

The spatial distribution of Sigma-HBCD concentrations showed higher median levels in samples from the Mediterranean Sea and English Channel respectively, i. e. 0. 19 ng g(- 1) wet weight (ww) and 0. 08 ng g(- 1) ww, related to high anthropogenic pressure from urban and industrial activities, while the median concentration was 0. 05 ng g(- 1) ww in samples from the Atlantic coast. Among PFCs, PFOS was the only compound detected in all samples and PFDA (perfluorodecanoic acid) was the second most frequently-detected compound. PFOS median concentrations were 0. 18 ng g(- 1) ww, 0. 09 ng g(- 1) ww and 0. 04 ng g(- 1) ww in samples from the English Channel, the Atlantic coast and the Mediterranean coast respectively. The highest PFOS concentration {{was found in the}} Loire estuary, possibly related to local industrial activities. The Mediterranean samples showed a different pattern, with predominant long-chain PFCAs (perfluorocarboxylic acids), suggesting the presence of alternative sources on the Mediterranean coast. The temporal trends studied in archived samples from the Seine estuary site showed a significant exponential increase in HBCD concentrations between 1981 and 2011, with a doubling time of 7 years, while PFOS levels underwent a significant linear decrease over time. These trends are coherent with current regulations on the use of these compounds.

Thirty years ago, PSTs were recognized as a major danger to seafood consumers in the tropics. The tropical dinoflagellate Pyrodinium bahamense biosynthesizes PSTs and its contamination of seafood has caused more illnesses and deaths than any other PST-producing microalga. Apart from this and other dinoflagellates, PSTs have been confirmed in tropical benthic algae, molluscs, echinoderms, crustacea, and other arthropods. Some of these organisms are unique in that, to date, they have only been found to be toxic in tropical oceans. For example, species of grazing and predatory gastropods, crabs, and more recently cephalopods have been discovered to contain PSTs in a number of intertidal tropical locations.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Oysters are <b>filter-feeding</b> bivalve <b>molluscs</b> {{that form}} {{cohesive}} reefs in estuarine and near-coastal waters. In {{addition to their}} economic value, oysters can exert a powerful influence on water quality, phytoplankton productivity, and nutrient cycling (Dame 1996; Ulanowicz and Tuttle 1992); they also affect current patterns, flow, and sedimentation rates (Lenihan 1999). Oyster reefs often provide the only hard structure in areas usually dominated by softer sandy and muddy bottoms (McCormick-Ray 1998; Hobbs 1988). In estuaries such as the Chesapeake Bay, reef structure supports many species of fish, such as tautog (Tautoga onitis), black sea bass (Centropristes striata), oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau), naked goby (Gobiosoma boscii), and others. Many other mobile fish and shellfish species, from striped bass (Morone saxatilis) to blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus), use oyster reefs as foraging areas or as a refuge from predation (Posey et al. 1999; Glancy et al. 2003). Oyster reefs have been estimated to be more productive than salt marshes in terms of fish and shellfish biomass produced per acre (Peterson et al. 2003), making them a highly productive habitat of great ecological and commercial value. Because oysters require a hard substrate for larval settlement (usually the shells of dead or living oysters), the increasing scarcity of shell in many areas has seriously limited or increased the costs of oyster habitat restoration. Dredging of “fossil ” oyster shells (formerly productive oyster reefs that have since been covered by sediment) {{has been used in}} the past to obtain the necessary materials but is now considered undesirable due to the non-renewable nature of the resource and potential environmental impacts of dredging. As a result, use of alternative materials (Figure 1) for creation or restoration of oyster reefs has become of increasing interest to resource managers and scientists nationwide. PURPOSE: Oyster reef restoration has become an important project componen...|$|R
40|$|Among marine invertebrates, <b>filter-feeding</b> lamellibranch <b>molluscs,</b> such as mussels, are {{remarkable}} {{for their ability}} to accumulate high levels of trace metals in their tissues, since these animals have mechanisms of detoxification of heavy metals (Viarengo and Nott, 1993; Hayes and McLellan, 1999; Viarengo et al., 2000). Heavy metals have the potential to act as catalysts in the oxidative deterioration of biological macromolecules and therefore the toxicities associated with these metals may be due, at least in part, to oxidative tissue damage. Mussel gills and digestive gland are the two main target tissues for heavy metal accumulation, which can alter the physiology of respiration and feeding processes (Viarengo et al., 1994). Recent studies have shown that metals such as iron, copper, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, nickel and vanadium exhibit the ability to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in lipid peroxidation, DNA damage, depletion of sulphydryl groups, altered signal transduction pathways and calcium homeostasis (Stohs and Bagchi, 1995; Galaris and Evangelou, 2002). On the other hand, marine invertebrates such as Mytilus sp. can face and sustain seasonal variations in environmental temperature and, as ectotherms, they respond usually by alterations of their respiration and metabolic rates. As an estimated proportion, 2 – 3 % of the oxygen consumed by aerobic cells is converted to oxygen radicals (O 2 ˙) and H 2 O 2 (Sohal and Weindruch, 1996), and increasing tissue oxygen consumption will entail elevated rates of ROS production in mitochondria (Boveris and Chance, 1976; Boveris et al., 1976). Higher temperatures are therefore likely to enhance ROS release, thereby increasing the risk of oxidative damage. ROS formation and subsequent damage are balanced by an array of cellular antioxidant defences including various antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, as well as low molecular binding proteins such as metallothioneins that function as radical quenchers and a...|$|R

It includes for the second time the data obtained in Romania and in Bulgaria. In addition to targeted samples, suspect samples may also be taken as part of residue control as a consequence of non-compliant results, suspicion of illegal treatment, or suspicion of non-compliance with the withdrawal period for an authorised veterinary medicinal product. 2. Information by EFSA on the progress of the research carried out on alternative methods for the detection of marine biotoxins Marine biotoxins are produced by planktonic algae and can be found in various <b>filter-feeding</b> bivalve <b>molluscs</b> such as mussels, scallops, oysters and clams. A representative of the European Food Safety Authority gave a presentation on "EFSA's risk assessments on marine biotoxins". EU limit values are established in order to avoid poisoning which is characterised by symptoms such as diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. The EFSA has provided scientific opinions for 2 marine biotoxins: okadaic acid and analogues (OA); and azaspicacid group (AZA) 1 and established acute reference doses for these two marine biotoxins. The EFSA´s Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain concluded that the mammalian bioassays have shortcomings that make them inappropriate for assessing the current EU limits. Biochemical and analytical methods have the greatest potential to replace the mammalian bioassay for the detection of OA and AZA toxins and to detect their levels below the current regulatory limit. EFSA will finalise the risk assessments of seven other marine biotoxins by mid 2009. 3. Information on a draft guidance document on the shelf-life studies for ready-to...|$|R
