40|$|The {{presence}} of <b>flexible</b> timber <b>diaphragms</b> in many existing unreinforced masonry buildings poses a significant {{challenge for the}} assessment of their seismic vulnerability. When <b>diaphragms</b> are <b>flexible,</b> different parts of a structure can interact with each other dynamically, in a way not typically encountered in modern structures with rigid diaphragms. As a result, the seismic analysis methods developed for buildings with rigid diaphragms, as well as our basic understanding of the dynamic behaviours of buildings under earthquake excitations, cannot be applied directly for buildings with <b>flexible</b> <b>diaphragms.</b> This thesis addresses two issues that require immediate attention in improving the seismic analysis of unreinforced masonry buildings with <b>flexible</b> <b>diaphragms,</b> namely (1) to enhance our understanding of the dynamic response characteristics of low-rise buildings with <b>flexible</b> <b>diaphragms,</b> and (2) to investigate the applicability of an array of existing analysis methods developed for rigid diaphragm structures. The research work presented in this thesis begins with a basic analysis of the elastic behaviour of symmetric buildings with <b>flexible</b> <b>diaphragms.</b> Through an analytical study of their modal properties, it is shown that at least two dominant modes are present in the dynamic responses of buildings with <b>flexible</b> <b>diaphragms.</b> Using the results of modal analysis, an improvement to the linear static analysis method is proposed. The inelastic behaviours of symmetric- and asymmetric-plan building systems with <b>flexible</b> <b>diaphragms</b> are then investigated through a systematic parametric analysis. It is shown that the effect of diaphragm flexibility varies depending on the level of stiffness- and strength-eccentricity of the system. A general diaphragm classification is developed to explain the influence of diaphragm flexibility on the global building response. A simple numerical modelling technique to incorporate the dynamic behaviours of <b>flexible</b> <b>diaphragms</b> in a three-dimensional equivalent frame modelling approach is also investigated, and validated against shake table test data. Finally, the applicability of nonlinear static procedures utilising single-mode, multi-mode and adaptive pushover analyses are investigated. Practical recommendations are provided for the use of various pushover analysis methods for unreinforced masonry buildings with <b>flexible</b> <b>diaphragms.</b> Thesis (Ph. D.)

50|$|Back in the U.S., Frederick Grinnell, who was {{manufacturing}} the Parmalee sprinkler, {{designed the}} more effective Grinnell sprinkler.

By this means the valve seat was forced against the valve by the water pressure, producing a self-closing action, so that the greater the water pressure, the tighter the valve. The <b>flexible</b> <b>diaphragm</b> had a further and most important function. It caused the valve and its seat to move outwards simultaneously until the solder joint was completely severed. Grinnell got a patent for his version of the sprinkler system. He also took his invention to Europe, where it was a much bigger success than the Parmalee version. Eventually, the Parmalee system was withdrawn, which left an open path for Grinnell and his invention.|$|E

40|$|The seismic {{behavior}} of large low-rise buildings with rigid walls and <b>flexible</b> <b>diaphragms</b> will be dominated {{more by the}} diaphragm’s seismic response than by the very stiff vertical walls. For practitioners, estimating the stiffness of large <b>flexible</b> <b>diaphragms</b> is important for computing building setbacks from property lines and adjacent structures as well as evaluating structural integrity under seismic loads. In addition, researchers attempting to accurately model a building’s dynamic behavior need to assemble an accurate diaphragm stiffness prediction. The traditional diaphragm chord model consists of a single continuous line of axial resistance at the diaphragm boundaries; however, as this paper will demonstrate a collective series of structural members distributed across the diaphragm will function intentionally or unintentionally as a collective chord, adding significant flexural stiffness and reducing chord forces. In seismically active areas, masonry and concrete wall anchorage forces utilize code-mandated continuous cross-ties within the diaphragm, and often these cross-ties are sufficiently strong and stiff to unintentionally develop collective chord behavior whether in steel or in wood diaphragm systems. While neglecting this embedded collective chord behavior results in conservative chord and diaphragm drift designs, researchers or practitioners trying to predict seismic response of these buildings will potentially underestimate the true seismic response...|$|R

The diaphragm is connected to the needle valve and as it moves inward it opens the needle valve to admit more fuel, thus replenishing the fuel as it is consumed. As fuel is replenished the diaphragm moves out due to fuel pressure and a small spring, closing the needle valve. A balanced state is reached which creates a steady fuel reservoir level, which remains constant in any orientation.|$|E

50|$|On the {{formation}} of British Railways on 1 January 1948, operators decided to produce a new range of standard coaches, instead of perpetuating existing designs—but the new types had to be compatible with the old. Two of the pre-BR companies (the GWR and the London, Midland and Scottish Railway) favoured the British Standard gangway, whereas the other two (the London and North Eastern Railway and the Southern Railway) used the Pullman type. In the design of their new Mark 1 coaches, British Railways decided to standardise on the Pullman type in view of its resistance to telescoping. These gangways consisted of a flat steel plate, having a large aperture for the passageway. At the bottom it was rivetted to the buffing plate, whilst the top was supported on the coach end by two telescopic spring units. On the coach end was a wooden doorframe; this {{was connected to the}} faceplate by a <b>flexible</b> <b>diaphragm</b> made from plasticised asbestos.

50|$|Prior to the {{widespread}} adoption of electronic fuel injection, most carbureted automobile engines used mechanical fuel pumps to transfer fuel from {{the fuel tank}} into the fuel bowls of the carburetor. Most mechanical fuel pumps are diaphragm pumps, which are a type of positive displacement pump. Diaphragm pumps contain a pump chamber whose volume is increased or decreased by the flexing of a <b>flexible</b> <b>diaphragm,</b> similar to the action of a piston pump. A check valve is located at both the inlet and outlet ports of the pump chamber to force the fuel to flow in one direction only. Specific designs vary, but in the most common configuration, these pumps are typically bolted onto the engine block or head, and the engine's camshaft has an extra eccentric lobe that operates a lever on the pump, either directly or via a pushrod, by pulling the diaphragm to bottom dead center. In doing so, the volume inside the pump chamber increased, causing pressure to decrease.This allows fuel to be pushed into the pump from the tank (caused by atmospheric pressure acting on the fuel in the tank). The return motion of the diaphragm to top dead center is accomplished by a diaphragm spring, during which the fuel in the pump chamber is squeezed through the outlet port and into the carburetor. The pressure at which the fuel is expelled from the pump is thus limited (and therefore regulated) by the force applied by the diaphragm spring.|$|E

40|$|An {{analytical}} model is developed {{to describe the}} out-of-plane response of one-way spanning unreinforced masonry (URM) walls by investigating the effects of various parameters. Horizontal crack height, masonry compressive strength, and diaphragm support stiffness properties are assumed as variables, and sensitivity analyses are performed to study the influence of these parameters on the cracked wall characteristic behavior. The parametric studies show that crack height significantly influences wall stability by affecting both the instability displacement and the wall lateral resistance. The reduction in cracked wall lateral resistance and in the instability displacement caused by finite masonry compressive strength is shown to be significantly amplified by the applied overburden. A study using the typical configuration of <b>flexible</b> <b>diaphragms</b> and URM walls indicates that the wall top support flexibility does not significantly influence cracked wall out-of-plane response.
