5|$|The {{battle was}} fought on a rough, marshy ground very {{favourable}} to the Spanish army. Norrey's initial {{assault on the}} Spanish right wing was successful, but the Spanish cavalry, led by Verdugo, routed the Dutch cavalry under William Louis, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg and broke the States' infantry. The English left was then {{cut off from the}} rest of the States' army and destroyed. During the pursuit of the States' troops Verdugo was nearly captured, but left unharmed in the end. Both Norreys and Count William Louis were wounded, and their army suffered a heavy death toll, losing many flags and all five of its guns. Verdugo could not capitalize on his victory because of a mutiny the following day by his German regiments and heavy flooding. The military situation in Friesland, however, had reached a turning point, and in 1582 the Spanish made great advances, <b>even</b> <b>taking</b> Steenwijk on 17 November 1582.|$|E
5|$|Pitt has a {{sustained}} interest in architecture, <b>even</b> <b>taking</b> {{time away from}} film to study computer-aided design at the Los Angeles offices of renowned architect Frank Gehry. He narrated Design e2, a PBS television series focused on worldwide efforts to build environmentally friendly structures through sustainable architecture and design. In 2000, he co-authored an architectural book on the Blacker House with the architects Thomas A. Heinz and Randell Makinson. In 2006, he founded the Make It Right Foundation, organizing housing professionals in New Orleans to finance and construct 150sustainable, affordable new houses in New Orleans's Ninth Ward following the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina. The project involves 13 architectural firms and the environmental organization Global Green USA, with several of the firms donating their services. Pitt and philanthropist Steve Bing have each committed $5million in donations. The first six homes were completed in October 2008, and in September 2009 Pitt received an award {{in recognition of the}} project from the U.S. Green Building Council, a non-profit trade organization that promotes sustainability in how buildings are designed, built and operated. Pitt met with U.S. President Barack Obama and Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi in March 2009 to promote his concept of green housing as a national model and to discuss federal funding possibilities.|$|E

Magruder constructed a defensive line from Yorktown on the York River, behind the Warwick River, to Mulberry Point on the James River (<b>even</b> <b>taking</b> advantage of some trenches originally dug by Cornwallis in 1781) to effectively block the full width of the Peninsula, although he could adequately man none of the defensive works at that time.

25|$|The {{controllers}} were hard-wired to {{the console}} with no connectors for cost reasons.

There were concerns regarding the durability of the joystick design and that children might step on joysticks left on the floor. Katsuyah Nakawaka attached a Game & Watch D-pad to the Famicom prototype and found that it was easy to use and caused no discomfort.

25|$|An 11–10 record early {{into the}} 2005–2006 season {{prompted}} Riley {{to come out}} of retirement and replace Van Gundy. Shortly thereafter, Riley would win his fifth and final championship as a head coach, as well as Miami's first championship in 2006. Riley would retire permanently following the 15-win 2007–2008 season, but once again remained as team president. His hand-picked replacement, longtime assistant Erik Spoelstra, is the current Heat head coach, a position he has held since 2008. At 38, he was the youngest head coach in the league at the time, as well as the first Filipino-American head coach in league history.

40|$|Aim. To compare {{antihypertensive}} {{effect of}} ramipril monotherapy at morning and <b>evening</b> <b>taking.</b> Material and methods. 22 patients (10 men, 12 women; aged 62, 1 ± 1, 9 y. o.) with arterial hypertension of 1 - 2 stage were involved {{into the open}} randomized crossover study. Patients were randomized into 2 groups depending on ramipril taking time (morning or evening). Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring (ABPM) was performed. Patients of both groups were comparable in basic clinical characteristics and initial ABPM indices. Analysis of peak and phase characteristics of 24 hour BP profile was used as well as standard evaluation. Treatment duration was 3 weeks. Ramipril dose titration was made in 1, 5 weeks. The average daily dose of ramipril was 6, 1 mg in the morning taking, and 5, 0 mg in the <b>evening</b> <b>taking.</b> Results. 20 patients finished study completely. 24 hour initial level of systolic (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) was 141, 5 ± 1, 6 / 85, 3 ± 1, 1 mm Hg. After ramipril monotherapy with <b>evening</b> <b>taking</b> BP reduced to 132, 6 ± 1, 6 / 79, 8 ± 1, 1 mm Hg (p< 0, 001) and with morning taking – to 131, 8 ± 1, 6 / 79, 2 ± 1, 1 mm Hg (p< 0, 001). Evening ramipril taking led to significant improvement of 24 hour BP profile. Night SBP/DBP reduction became deeper from 7, 7 ± 1, 2 / 11, 5 ± 1, 3 % to 12, 5 ± 1, 2 / 19, 1 ± 1, 3 % (p< 0, 01). Morning taking did not have significant influence on these indices. Ramipril {{did not result in}} clinically significant hypotension including night one. Conclusion. Evening ramipril taking is effective and safe. It can be recommended to patients with insufficient night BP dipping (non dippers).  </p...|$|R

On the slopes of Craignaught Hill was fought a singularly unusual battle between the Boyds of Kilmarnock and the Stewarts of Darnley. Sir Alan Stewart had been treacherously slain by Sir Thomas Boyd, and his son, Alexander Stewart, was determined to take revenge. Sir Thomas was surprised {{on the night of}} 9 July 1439, whilst riding past Craignaught on his way north and although outnumbered, he and his followers fought on, <b>even</b> <b>taking</b> agreed rest periods indicated by the sounding of a horn. Eventually and inevitably Sir Thomas was killed, stabbed in the back by a Stewart, and a large number of his followers were also killed.|$|E
25|$|The Local Government Act 1972 {{abolished}} all existing {{local authorities}} outside London (other than parish councils) in England and Wales. This {{meant that the}} various local authorities that held city status ceased to exist on 1 April 1974. To preserve city status new letters patent were issued to the most relevant metropolitan borough, non-metropolitan district or successor parish councils created by the Act. Some of these came to cover local government districts many times wider than the previous city, <b>even</b> <b>taking</b> in many square miles of rural land outside the urban areas, for example the cities of Bradford, Leeds and Winchester. Three non-local authority preservations arose: here charter trustees were established for the cities of Lichfield and Salisbury (or New Sarum) being neither districts nor civil parishes, and special letters patent for a time preserved the city of Rochester.|$|E
25|$|Black people {{account for}} 60% of Minneapolis Police Department's {{low-level}} arrests, overall.

Of nearly 10,000 low-level arrests over 33 months made by 1,017 Minneapolis officers between 2013–14, the vast majority were made by eight officers. Seven averaged between 1,000-1,250.
