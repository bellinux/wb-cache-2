500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "No Man's Land" [...] {{was directed by}} long-time collaborator Ryuji Seki. The music video was shot with Koda {{in front of a}} green screen to immolate the chroma key functions. Koda, who was present at post-production for the music video, suggested the use of black and white colouring, which Seki then added. This is Koda's first music video to be in full black and white. The video opens with a <b>distance</b> <b>shot</b> of a wasteland, with decaying trees, floating black leaves, and hills. Koda is seen dragging herself through the valley, and an inter cut scene features a body shot of Koda in front of an abandoned city and abandoned merry-go-round; the merry-go-round references the lyric in the song. As the first hook stars in the song, it features two scenes; Koda singing the track in a distance, and close-ups of Koda wearing a shackle. The verse has Koda wondering through a valley and singing the song.|$|E
