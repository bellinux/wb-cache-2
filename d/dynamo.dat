5|$|In November 1945, with league {{competition}} still suspended, Arsenal {{were one}} of the teams that played a <b>Dynamo</b> Moscow side touring the UK. With many players still serving abroad in the armed forces, Arsenal were severely depleted and used six guest players, including Stanley Matthews and Stan Mortensen, which led <b>Dynamo</b> to declare they were playing an England XI, although three of the side were actually Welsh. In any case, <b>Dynamo</b> themselves had Vsevolod Bobrov on loan from CDKA Moscow. The match, at White Hart Lane, kicked off in thick fog and the slick and technically proficient <b>Dynamo</b> won 4–3, after Arsenal had led 3–1 at half-time.|$|E
5|$|A fee {{equivalent}} to €280,000 {{was enough to}} take him to the Ukrainian Premier League and <b>Dynamo</b> Kiev in January 1998, where he signed a four-year deal. Here he scored six goals in 71 league games over the two-and-a-half seasons he spent there. The Ukrainian club had been under the ownership of Hryhoriy Surkis and the late Valeriy Lobanovskyi had just been installed as manager; they would go on to win eight consecutive league titles. Kaladze also appeared in both legs of the semi-final of the 1998–99 Champions League against Bayern Munich, which <b>Dynamo</b> Kyiv lost 4–3 on aggregate. En route to the semi-finals, they beat teams like Real Madrid, Barcelona and Arsenal. He won eight league titles in a row during his time at both Dinamo Tbilisi and <b>Dynamo</b> Kyiv.|$|E

5|$|Simulating the geodynamo {{requires}} numerically {{solving a}} set of nonlinear partial differential equations for the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) of the Earth's interior. Simulation of the MHD equations is performed on a 3D grid of points and the fineness of the grid, which in part determines the realism of the solutions, is limited mainly by computer power. For decades, theorists were confined to creating kinematic <b>dynamo</b> computer models in which the fluid motion is chosen in advance and {{the effect on the}} magnetic field calculated. Kinematic <b>dynamo</b> theory was mainly a matter of trying different flow geometries and testing whether such geometries could sustain a <b>dynamo.</b>|$|E
50|$|In July 2016, Delhi <b>Dynamos</b> again {{retained}} him {{for next}} season ISL {{for the third straight}} time. Delhi <b>Dynamos</b> sent Souvik to A-League club Central Coast Mariners FC for a week long training camp. Delhi <b>Dynamos</b> head coach Gianluca Zambrotta rated Souvik a versatile player and used him as a left back in entire season. Souvik started all matches for Delhi <b>Dynamos</b> in 2016 campaign.|$|R

5000|$|Houston <b>Dynamos</b> was a U.S. {{soccer team}} which existed {{in various forms}} from 1983 to 1991. In 1991, the team’s owners changed the name to Houston International, but the team lasted only through the 1992 season before folding. The <b>Dynamos</b> were founded by Pete Kane and John M Gaughan. The <b>Dynamos</b> were founded with the {{intention}} of a continued building of the sport of soccer in Houston Texas. The <b>Dynamos</b> were the first team to give contracts to its players based on an entire year not on a season. The Houston <b>Dynamos</b> players year round went to parks, schools and events promoting the sport of soccer. In 1985 the <b>Dynamos</b> brought Pele to Houston creating great interest in the sport and spreading goodwill.|$|R
5|$|The club's League title win in 1986 {{saw them}} {{qualify for the}} European Cup in 198687, where Celtic {{eliminated}} Shamrock Rovers 30 on aggregate in the first round. The next round saw Celtic take on Soviet champions <b>Dynamo</b> Kyiv, a side comprising {{a large number of}} players in their national side. A hard-fought 11 draw in the first leg at Parkhead did not bode well for the return match in Kiev. Oleh Blokhin's free-kick in the second leg gave the Soviet's an early lead, but Mark McGhee levelled the tie shortly after half-time. <b>Dynamo</b> regained the lead later on in the second half, but Celtic continued to press. A late third goal from <b>Dynamo,</b> however, saw them clinch the tie.|$|E
5|$|The {{lack of an}} {{intrinsic}} magnetic field at Venus was surprising, given that it is similar to Earth in size, and was expected also to contain a <b>dynamo</b> at its core. A <b>dynamo</b> requires three things: a conducting liquid, rotation, and convection. The core {{is thought to be}} electrically conductive and, although its rotation is often thought to be too slow, simulations show it is adequate to produce a <b>dynamo.</b> This implies that the <b>dynamo</b> is missing {{because of a lack of}} convection in Venus's core. On Earth, convection occurs in the liquid outer layer of the core because the bottom of the liquid layer is much hotter than the top. On Venus, a global resurfacing event may have shut down plate tectonics and led to a reduced heat flux through the crust. This caused the mantle temperature to increase, thereby reducing the heat flux out of the core. As a result, no internal geodynamo is available to drive a magnetic field. Instead, the heat from the core is being used to reheat the crust.|$|E
5|$|The {{opposition}} {{in the third round}} were <b>Dynamo</b> Berlin of East Germany. The first leg at Dynamo's home ground the Sportforum ended in a 0–0 draw. The second leg at Anfield was more eventful Liverpool took the lead through Phil Boersma in the first minute and <b>Dynamo</b> equalised six minutes later. Two further goals for Liverpool secured a 3–1 victory in the match and on aggregate. In the quarter-finals Liverpool again faced East German opposition, their opponents were <b>Dynamo</b> Dresden. Liverpool won the first leg 2–0 at Anfield, and they won the second leg 1–0 in East Germany, to beat Dresden 3–0 on aggregate.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{returning}} home, he is distraught {{to learn}} {{that his mother had}} died just before he arrived. Guilty and somewhat disillusioned, he turns to the <b>dynamos</b> in the hydro-electric plant for answers. He sees them as motherly, and tries to get them to forgive him. Eventually, he brings Ada to the <b>dynamos</b> to convert her. When he feels the <b>dynamos</b> have rejected her (remembering that his own mother called Ada a harlot) he shoots Ada, climbs up to the <b>dynamo's</b> brushes, and electrocutes himself. The play closes in Mrs. Fife's helpless expression of distress at the <b>dynamo's</b> treatment of them all.|$|R

50|$|Following Zimbabwe's independence, <b>Dynamos</b> {{began to}} compete in the African Cup of Champions Clubs in 1981 as Zimbabwean champions. <b>Dynamos</b> reached the quarter-finals at the first attempt. This was matched in 1984 and 1987, then topped in 1998; <b>Dynamos</b> reached the final before losing 4-2 on {{aggregate}} to Ivorian champions ASEC Mimosas. <b>Dynamos</b> reached the CAF Champions League semi-finals in 2008, but despite defeating ASEC earlier in the tournament, were overcome by Coton Sport of Cameroon.|$|R
5|$|Valencia {{finished}} second in their UEFA Cup group, although Villa was not featured heavily and was often an unused or late-match substitute. He scored a late winner against Marítimo and {{was used in the}} Round of 32 against <b>Dynamo</b> Kyiv, though he did not make the score sheet. The two legs finished in a 3–3 aggregate score, with <b>Dynamo</b> progressing through the away goals rule.|$|E
5|$|An 11-year {{sunspot cycle}} is {{half of a}} 22-year Babcock–Leighton <b>dynamo</b> cycle, which {{corresponds}} to an oscillatory exchange of energy between toroidal and poloidal solar magnetic fields. At solar-cycle maximum, the external poloidal dipolar magnetic field is near its dynamo-cycle minimum strength, but an internal toroidal quadrupolar field, generated through differential rotation within the tachocline, is near its maximum strength. At {{this point in the}} <b>dynamo</b> cycle, buoyant upwelling within the convective zone forces emergence of toroidal magnetic field through the photosphere, giving rise to pairs of sunspots, roughly aligned east–west and having footprints with opposite magnetic polarities. The magnetic polarity of sunspot pairs alternates every solar cycle, a phenomenon known as the Hale cycle.|$|E
5|$|On 2 August 2014, Valbuena {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} with <b>Dynamo</b> Moscow in a reported £6 million transfer. In his second game for <b>Dynamo</b> and first as a starter on 13 August 2014 against FC Ufa, he assisted on both of his team's goals in a 2-0 victory. In his next game against FC Arsenal Tula on 17 August 2014, he again assisted on both goals in Dynamo's 2-1 victory. On 28 August 2014, <b>Dynamo</b> defeated AC Omonia in the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League play-off round, through a decisive goal by Christopher Samba in the 93rd minute of the return leg following a free kick performed by Valbuena, and qualified {{for the first time}} for the group stage of a European competition (since the group stage was introduced). On 31 August 2014, he scored his first goal for <b>Dynamo</b> in a 2-0 victory over FC Krasnodar. On 16 September 2014, he had to undergo an emergency appendectomy. He returned to playing on 2 October 2014 in a Europa League group game against PSV Eindhoven, in which Yuri Zhirkov scored a winning goal deep into injury time after a corner delivered by Valbuena.|$|E
50|$|After {{the end of}} the 2014 ISL season, Delhi <b>Dynamos</b> parted {{ways with}} their inaugural season head coach, Harm van Veldhoven. Soon after, Roberto Carlos, was named as the new head coach for the 2015 season. The season began for Delhi <b>Dynamos</b> with a 2-0 loss to the Goa on 4 October. The team ended the season with six wins through {{fourteen}} matches and qualified for the finals. In the finals, the Delhi <b>Dynamos</b> took on Goa. In the home-leg, the <b>Dynamos</b> won 1-0 with Robin Singh scoring the winner. However, in the away second-leg, the <b>Dynamos</b> lost 3-0 and were thus knocked-out of the ISL finals 3-1 aggregate.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dynamos</b> Football Club (also {{referred}} to simply as <b>Dynamos,</b> or, outside of Zimbabwe, as <b>Dynamos</b> Harare or Zimbabwe <b>Dynamos)</b> is a Zimbabwean professional football club based since 1963 at Rufaro Stadium, Mbare, Harare. The team currently participates in Zimbabwe's top-tier, the Premier Soccer League. Founded in 1963 after a merger between two lesser teams in Mbare, Harare Township, Rhodesia, the side quickly {{became one of}} the strongest in the Rhodesian league, and by the recognition of the country's independence as Zimbabwe in 1980 had become the country's most successful team, having won six national titles. <b>Dynamos</b> have won a record 22 league titles and 16 cup titles.|$|R
25|$|Other {{types of}} <b>dynamos</b> exist, but are less common. For example, there are <b>dynamos</b> that are {{attached}} to the fork and driven by the wheel's spokes.|$|R
5|$|The {{radiative}} {{zone and}} the convective zone {{are separated by}} a transition layer, the tachocline. This is a region where the sharp regime change between the uniform rotation of the radiative zone and the differential rotation of the convection zone results in a large shear between the two—a condition where successive horizontal layers slide past one another. Presently, it is hypothesized (see Solar <b>dynamo)</b> that a magnetic <b>dynamo</b> within this layer generates the Sun's magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|United's woes {{continued}} {{in their final}} match of April, where they traveled south to take on Houston <b>Dynamo</b> on 29 April. United was routed 4–1 in the match, making them have a league-worst 16 goals conceded. However, with 10 goals scored, United was jointly tied for second in the league for goals scored on. The Orange Crush came out on a roaring start, as Dynamo-striker Will Bruin netted in the fourth minute of play. In the 39th minute, United defender Marc Burch scored off a complex free kick that caused the <b>Dynamo</b> defense to scramble, tallying his first goal of 2011. The parity was short-lived, as Bruin would regain the lead for Houston two minutes later off of a header from Brad Davis cross. Bruin would complete his hat trick in the 57th minute to give <b>Dynamo</b> a commanding 3–1 lead. Houston's Cam Weaver came in to add a buffer to {{the lead in the}} 62nd minute.|$|E
5|$|Aberdeen {{reached the}} semi-finals of the 1983–84 European Cup Winners' Cup, before losing to Porto 2–0 on aggregate. In {{the first round}} of the 1984–85 European Champion Club's Cup Aberdeen lost to East Berlin side BFC <b>Dynamo</b> in a penalty {{shoot-out}} 4–5, following a 3–3 on aggregate in regular times. Today, both clubs enjoy friendly relations.|$|E
50|$|In June 2015, Delhi <b>Dynamos</b> {{retained}} him {{for next}} season ISL along with 4 more players. He is highly rated by Roberto Carlos in Delhi <b>Dynamos</b> where he played almost all matches for a right back for Delhi <b>dynamos</b> in 2015 season. He helped Delhi to reach semi final, in which Delhi lost 3-1 to FC Goa.|$|R
