5|$|After the Order emerged victorious {{from the}} siege, it {{received}} {{financial support from}} Europe, which was used to construct the new capital city on the Sciberras Peninsula. The Italian engineer Francesco Laparelli was sent by the Pope to design the city's fortifications, which were designed along the Italian bastioned system. Laparelli's original design consisted of a bastioned enceinte, with nine cavaliers and a ditch. The city was to be designed along a <b>grid</b> <b>plan,</b> and was to include a naval arsenal and a Manderaggio (a harbour for small ships).|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the eighteenth century, Scotland's rapidly {{expanding}} economy and population resulted in the laying out of numerous new towns and remodelled settlements, resulting in a need for new churches to support the local residents. These included St Andrew's and St George's West Church, George Street, in the New Town of Edinburgh, designed by Andrew Frazer (1782–87), followed in the tradition of Gibbs, with an oval plan, tetrastyle Corinthian portico and a tall steeple. The builder, Alexander Stevens, probably also designed the steeple of St Cuthbert's Church (1789–90). At Fochabers, from 1776 John Baxter redesigned the village on a <b>grid</b> <b>plan,</b> with a central square focused on Bellie Church (1795–97), still following in the tradition of Gibbs, with a tetrastyle portico and steeple.|$|E
30|$|In {{existing}} literature, while incorporating N- 1 constraints into transmission expansion {{models is}} common practice [18, 19, 20, 21, 22], embedding constraints of short circuit currents into transmission expansion planning models is not thoroughly discussed. Since short circuit currents have strong nonlinear relation with decision variables of candidate transmission lines, current power <b>grid</b> <b>planning</b> models have defects of heavy computational burden and low solution accuracy. In an actual power <b>grid</b> <b>planning</b> project, instead of embedding constraints in the <b>grid</b> <b>planning</b> model, short circuit currents are calculated after determining the power <b>grid</b> <b>planning</b> result. This is an open-loop approach in which short circuit currents are checked manually. Once the short circuit currents are excessive, the power <b>grid</b> <b>planning</b> result needs modifying according to artificial experience. The major drawback {{of this procedure}} is low efficiency and loss of optimality. Therefore, current power <b>grid</b> <b>planning</b> model can merely guarantee N- 1 security. A model that can ensure both short circuit currents constraints and N- 1 security needs investigating.|$|R
25|$|One of the {{greatest}} difficulties with <b>grid</b> <b>plans</b> is their lack of specialisation, most of the important amenities being concentrated along the city's main arteries. Often <b>grid</b> <b>plans</b> are found in linear settlements, with a main street connecting between the perpendicular roads. However, this can be mitigated by allowing mixed use development so that destinations become closer to home. Many cities, especially in Latin America, still successfully retain their <b>grid</b> <b>plans.</b> Recently, planners in the United States and Canada have revisited the idea of reintroducing grid patterns to many cities and towns.|$|R
40|$|One {{objective}} of <b>grid</b> <b>planning</b> for low voltage grids {{is to determine}} cable diameters of feeders. This usually involves simulating worst case scenarios to estimate peak loads, although the probability of such scenarios to actually occur is not known. Furthermore, today's <b>grid</b> <b>planning</b> needs to account for new technologies like dispersed generation and electric vehicles. A worst case approach, for example, would consider generation without any simultaneous load. However, in practical experience {{there is always a}} minimum load, which mitigates the effect of voltage rise due to generation. This publication presents a new approach to probabilistic <b>grid</b> <b>planning</b> under the consideration of risks of certain scenarios to occur. This methodology can help to <b>plan</b> <b>grids</b> more efficiently...|$|R
5|$|Insofar as the hilly {{topography}} {{of the site}} would allow, the city was built on a Roman <b>grid</b> <b>plan</b> and settled with veterans who fought in the victorious legions and other foreign colonists. In the 2nd century CE, Emperor Hadrian built a grand theater in Neapolis that could seat up to 7,000 people. Coins found in Nablus dating to this period depict Roman military emblems and gods and goddesses of the Greek pantheon such as Zeus, Artemis, Serapis, and Asklepios. Neapolis was entirely pagan at this time. Justin Martyr {{who was born in}} the city c. 100 CE, came into contact with Platonism, but not with Christians there. The city flourished until the civil war between Septimius Severus and Pescennius Niger in 198–9 CE. Having sided with Niger, who was defeated, the city was temporarily stripped of its legal privileges by Severus, who designated these to Sebastia instead.|$|E
5|$|The Soviets and an American {{group of}} architects each devised {{separate}} outlines for rebuilding {{the town of}} Spitak. Following an invitation by the Soviets for a critique of their plan, the American's proposal was ultimately accepted as the way forward. The new plan would deviate from Soviet styles that {{were found to be}} rigid and outdated, and would mirror characteristics of the local culture. For many years following World War II the Soviets practiced a methodical top-down approach to urban planning and building, constructing a large number of uniformly built row style apartment units, and the Soviets plan for rebuilding Spitak did not diverge from that approach. The Soviet's <b>grid</b> <b>plan</b> road scheme was found to {{not take into account the}} hillside at the new city's location, and the American's plan included finer details of how commercial centers and government facilities were grouped together in an open and communal style.|$|E

40|$|Due {{to the few}} {{computing}} resource planning options currently available in <b>Grid</b> computing, capacity <b>planning,</b> an old discipline for analyzing resource purchases, is simple to perform. However, once a commercial computing Grid is established, which provides many different resource types at variable prices, capacity planning will become more complex and the user will require support for handling this difficult process.

40|$|The paper {{lists the}} drivers and the {{barriers}} for a widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), describes the different stakeholders {{involved in the}} electro-mobility ecosystem and summarises the main issues for the integration of EVs in distribution grids. Then, it presents some outcomes of the PlanGridEV Project, including the proposed new <b>grid</b> <b>planning</b> criteria, the envisaged future scenarios for EV integration, the expected services to be provided by EVs to distribution system operators and the ICT requirements linked to those services. Electric Vehicles (EVs) will become {{an important part of}} the transport system in Europe and can thus create a number of benefits in term of oil dependence reduction, air quality improvement and trade balance enhancement. However, they can also become a burden for distribution system operator (DSOs) if they charge in an uncontrolled way. In addition, the increasing deployment of renewable energy sources (RES) and other distributed energy resources (DER) are making the distribution <b>grid</b> <b>planning</b> more complicated than in the past, when consumers were considered to be passive elements and grid was dimensioned to meet peak demand. PlanGridEV project proposes new planning procedures, which take into account the possibility to manage consumers’ electricity demand, including the charging process of EVs, both to better integrate DER and to more efficiently plan the investments in the distribution <b>grid.</b> The <b>planning</b> rules will be validated by carrying out four test beds, which will serve as an input for assessing the economic performance of four scenarios, representing four theoretical alternatives for distribution <b>grid</b> <b>planning.</b> Different services that EVs can provide to DSOs and other actors in the e-mobility ecosystem will be analysed in each scenario. Then, a <b>grid</b> <b>planning</b> tool will be developed to help DSOs consider EVs and demand and other demand response (DR) capabilities when <b>planning</b> distribution <b>grid</b> extension.

40|$|European {{directives}} {{for renewable}} energies and decreasing costs of these alternative generation technologies are incentivising {{a transformation of}} the electricity markets, grid infrastructure {{and the way the}} grid is operated. Distribution networks, which were not traditionally designed to host generation, have to deal now with distributed energy resources that feed intermittent power into the grid. Thus, {{due to the fact that}} excess energy from these intermittent sources cannot be hosted, not only the need of energy storage in power systems has emerged but also of new control strategies in the eld of <b>grid</b> <b>planning</b> such as demand response or curtailment of generation units. In order to take SmartGrid elements and control strategies into the planning stage, the ETH Zurich spin-o Adaptricity has developed DPG. sim, a time-series simulation software that can overcome traditional <b>grid</b> <b>planning</b> software limitations in representing the behavior of SmartGrid elements for <b>grid</b> <b>planning</b> studies. Within the traditional <b>grid</b> extension <b>planning,</b> this thesis addresses the implementation of an automatic grid upgrade algorithm to be used with DPG. sim to automatically select which elements must be substituted. This work also demonstrates, using temporal simulations in DPG. sim, the scope of active network management strategies to enlarge grid hosting capacity of distributed energy generation. Thus, it will show how these strategies can reduce the technical challenges faced by Distribution System Operators (DSOs) such as overvoltages and line overloadings...|$|R
30|$|With {{existing}} {{calculation methods}} {{of renewable energy}} accommodation capacity for large power grid, {{it is difficult to}} effectively support actual <b>grid</b> <b>planning</b> and operation control. Aiming at the practical engineering problem of abandoning wind and PV in the “three north” area of China, this paper presents a new calculation model of renewable energy accommodation capacity on the basis of time series production simulation model. The proposed model takes into account utilization level of inter-provincial and inter-regional tie-lines, making calculation results more in line with actual project needs and can solve China’s problems. The practical problem of calculating accommodation capacity of renewable energy in “three north” area has certain guiding significance for <b>grid</b> <b>planning</b> and actual regulation and operation.|$|R
