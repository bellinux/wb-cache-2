40|$|In 1978, the Federal {{government}} {{passed the}} <b>Forestry</b> Assistance <b>Act</b> which provides guidelines {{for states to}} support management on non-industrial private lands through the Forest Stewardship Program (FSP). In 1983, Illinois passed the Illinois <b>Forestry</b> Development <b>Act</b> which outlines the specific requirements for non-industrial private landowners residing in Illinois {{to take advantage of}} the FSP. Since the inception of the program, there has been little analysis to determine the quality of land enrolled in the FSP. Launched in 2004, the Spatial Analysis Project is a program sponsored by the US Forest Service to determine the type of land enrolled within FSP. Within each state, the SAP used an aggregate analysis based upon multiple criteria to divide all land available for the FSP into three categories - low, medium, and high stewardship potential. The objective of this project was twofold, first to determine if Illinois is effectively enrolling lands in the high stewardship potential category. Secondly, because timber production must be the primary goal of a FSP plan in Illinois, this study analyzed whether lands classified as high stewardship potential were also high in forest productivity. Results indicate that while Illinois is effectively enrolling high stewardship potential lands, these lands are not necessarily highly productive. This information could be used to give preference for cost-share assistance to those lands that are classified as highly productive, particularly in times when funding is limited, rather than on a first come, first served basis...|$|R

40|$|In the {{land-based}} sectors, {{agricultural production}} generally {{is a source}} of carbon, while <b>forestry</b> can <b>act</b> as a sink. This report focuses on new research examining the interaction of the two. The core of the research is the Lincoln Trade and Environment model (LTEM), a partial equilibrium model which links trade in NZ with the main trading countries overseas, through to production and associated environmental consequences. This research report discusses the issues, methodology and results from research expanding the model to include forestry. This was done by incorporating the capabilities of the Global Forest Products Model (GFPM) into the LTEM and hence producing an integrated model of agricultural and forestry land-uses for NZ and overseas. The paper thereby reports on the development of a model of international trade that encompasses major agricultural commodities and forestry, complete with linkages and feedback with the environment and differentiated international markets. The modelling results are examined to draw general conclusions about the impact of climate change, climate policies, mitigation, and markets on both producer returns and greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture and forestry in New Zealand. These results are then discussed more broadly, in particular with an eye towards policy implications...|$|R
