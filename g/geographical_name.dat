5|$|The Kurdish <b>geographical</b> <b>name</b> {{changes were}} exempt under the Ottoman Empire {{due to the}} Islamic {{religious}} orientation of Kurds.

40|$|Geographical namses play {{prominent}} {{roles in}} various fields in Oman. While {{working in the}} National Survey Authority in Oman, the researcher found {{that there are some}} problematic issues related to the use and management of <b>geographical</b> <b>names</b> such as lack of databases and the contradiction of <b>geographical</b> <b>names</b> caused by having more than one establishment dealing with <b>geographical</b> <b>names.</b> This study seeks to consider these and contribute to developing the use of the existing <b>geographical</b> <b>names</b> on maps in Oman. The aims are: (1) to investigate best practices for collecting, approving and managing geographical names; (2) to identify the existing policies, procedures and use of <b>geographical</b> <b>names</b> in Oman; and (3) to propose a system for collection, approval and management of <b>geographical</b> <b>names</b> in Oman. The concepts and importance of maps, map history and their relationship with <b>geographical</b> <b>names</b> are discussed. This is in addition to highlighting the importance of <b>geographical</b> <b>names</b> and their functions and roles. The relationship between the proper names and the scale of maps was investigated. The results show that the proper names generally decrease in density in relation to the ground area covered as scale is reduced, but names increase in density on the map with reducing scale. Methods for collecting <b>geographical</b> <b>names</b> are reviewed, followed by a discussion of the methods of recording and storing <b>geographical</b> <b>names.</b> The particular problems that face collecting <b>geographical</b> <b>names</b> in Oman were highlighted. They are the pronunciation of <b>geographical</b> <b>names,</b> the language differendes, the inaccessibility of some areas and the lack of cooperation of local residents in provision of accurate information. The transliteration of <b>geographical</b> <b>names</b> in general and in Oman specifically is investigated with the most prominent problems that face <b>geographical</b> <b>names</b> transliteration in Oman identified. The first problem is the variety of languages and dialects in Oman as a result of Oman's rich history of trade and location which encouraged immigration. Other problems are the qualifications of the <b>geographical</b> <b>names</b> team and the lack of a responsible establishment for <b>geographical</b> <b>names.</b> The standardisation of <b>geographical</b> <b>names</b> and its advantages are discussed, highlighting Oman's case in dealing with geographical namse. From this discussion the importance of having a <b>geographical</b> <b>names</b> committee responsible for <b>geographical</b> <b>names</b> was demonstrated and some examplse of <b>geographical</b> <b>names</b> committees in a range of countries presented. An analysis of the problem of standardisation of <b>geographical</b> <b>names</b> in Oman culminates in a proposal for a <b>geographical</b> <b>names</b> committee in Oman in order to overcome the problems identified. A committee structure is suggested, along with membership and responsibilities. This is followed by recommendations for supporting the proposed committee. For example, unifying geogrpahical names and training all the <b>geographical</b> <b>names</b> team members. Finally, someother recommendations for further studies, such as creating <b>geographical</b> <b>names</b> gazateer and studying geographical namse in the Holy Quran, are suggested...|$|R
5|$|<b>Geographical</b> <b>name</b> {{changes in}} Turkey have been undertaken, periodically, in bulk from 1913 {{to the present}} by {{successive}} Turkish governments. Thousands of names within the Turkish Republic or the Ottoman Empire have lost or departed from their popular or historic alternatives in favour of recognizably Turkish names, {{as part of the}} Turkification policy. The governments have argued that such names are foreign and/or divisive against Turkish unity. Names changed were usually of Armenian, Greek, Georgian (Including Laz), Bulgarian, Kurdish, Assyrian, or Arabic origin.|$|E
5|$|Most of the <b>geographical</b> <b>name</b> changes {{occurred}} in the eastern provinces {{of the country and}} on the coast of the eastern Black Sea, where minority populations tend to live. Through independent study, etymologist Sevan Nisanyan estimates that, of the geographical location name changes, 4,200 were Greek, 4,000 Kurdish, 3,600 Armenian, 750 Arabic, 400 Assyrian, 300 Georgian, 200 Laz, and 50 others. The official statistics of The Special Commission for Name Change (Ad Degistirme Ihtisas Komisyonu) claim that the total number of villages, towns, cities, and settlements renamed is 12,211.

5|$|Early Europeans {{replaced}} most of {{the original}} Māori names with their own, although they retained some Māori names {{in the north and}} central regions of the North Island. The Royal Geographical Society of London was responsible for place names until 1894 when authority was given to the Governor of New Zealand. Prime Minister Joseph Ward moved an amendment in 1894 that gave preference to Māori names for any new features and allowed misspelt names to be altered (although this did not always occur). In 1924 the Honorary Geographic Board of New Zealand was set up to advise on place names, and in 1946 the New Zealand Geographic Board (NZGB) was established and given power to change or implement Māori and English names. Anyone can propose a <b>geographical</b> <b>name</b> to the board, who consult local Māori and allow public submissions before determining if the name should be made official.

25|$|Problematic point(s): it {{is often}} unclear whether a common name is {{actually}} part of an official <b>geographical</b> <b>name,</b> e.g. many people believe Fertő tó is the actual name of Fertő Lake so they write it with a hyphen, while the name is only Fertő, thus a space must be used before tó. In addition, names like Szahara sivatag (‘Sahara Desert’) or Urál hegység ‘Ural Mountains’ don’t contain the common name, so no hyphen must be used, {{as opposed to the}} Kaszpi-tenger type.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the First World War precious metal coins were recalled from circulation, and in the early 1920s all coins disappeared because of the heavy inflation of the Hungarian korona.

Proposals included turul (a bird from Hungarian mythology), turán (from the <b>geographical</b> <b>name</b> and ideological term Turan), libertás (the colloquial name of the poltura coins issued by Francis II Rákóczi), and máriás (the colloquial name of coins depicting Mary, patroness of Hungary).|$|E

Additionally, Hubei Province is well-known for its diverse landforms, including mountains, hills, mounds and plains. This area is called “The Province of Thousand Lakes” due to the abundance of water resources. <b>Geographical</b> <b>names</b> are exclusive names given to physical or anthropogenic geographic entities at specific spatial locations and are important signs by which humans understand natural and human activities.

25|$|If a <b>geographical</b> <b>name</b> {{contains}} a geographical common name (e.g. ‘river, lake, mountain, island’ etc.) or another common name or an adjective, the compound is written with a hyphen (e.g. Huron-tó ‘Lake Huron’ or Új-Zéland ‘New Zealand’). When these forms are converted into an adjective, only those elements are left capitalized which are actual proper names themselves (Kaszpi-tenger and Kaszpi-tengeri ‘Caspian Sea’, however Új-Zéland and új-zélandi – zélandi {{is not considered}} a proper name because it carries the adjectival suffix). The same rule is applied to compounds with three or more elements, although compounds with more than four elements are simplified (lower-ranked hyphens are removed).|$|E
