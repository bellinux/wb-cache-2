5|$|Following the 1987 premiere, {{the opera}} {{received}} mixed reviews; some critics dismissed the work, predicting it would soon vanish. However, {{it has been}} presented on many occasions since, in both Europe and North America, and has been recorded twice. In 2011, the opera received its Metropolitan Opera debut, a production based on the original sets, {{and in the same}} year was given an abstract production in Toronto by the Canadian Opera Company. Recent critical opinion <b>has</b> <b>tended</b> to recognize the work as a significant and lasting contribution to American opera.|$|E

5|$|Scholarship in {{the area}} of Jewish Christian studies <b>has</b> <b>tended</b> to be based on {{artificial}} constructs similar to those developed by the early Christian heresiologists, with the underlying assumption that all of the beliefs and practices of these groups were based on theology. This has led to the perpetuation of ideological definitions that fail {{to take into account the}} pluriformity of these groups, reflecting differences in geography, time periods in history, and ethnicity. With respect to Epiphanius, and the Ebionites in particular, insufficient attention has been paid to the highly speculative nature of his theological constructs and his mixing together of disparate sources, including his use of a gospel harmony that may have had nothing to do with the Ebionite sect known to Irenaeus. In the end, he presents an enigmatic picture of the Ebionites and their place in early Christian history.|$|E
5|$|The Itchen Navigation {{supports}} a rich flora and fauna, and one {{benefit of the}} 5-year grant-funded restoration project has been the regular monitoring and publishing of reports to document this. Annual reports on the populations of birds, bats, otters, water voles and butterflies, damselflies and dragonflies have been produced, with occasional reports on other aspects, while the Environment Agency has produces fisheries reports. As part of the project, a number of engineering works {{have been carried out}} to stabilise the banks, and trees have been cut back {{to reduce the amount of}} shade and encourage the growth of marginal vegetation. In the case of the water vole survey, this has been concentrated on the sections where work has been carried out, whereas the butterfly, damselfly and dragonfly survey <b>has</b> <b>tended</b> to cover the whole navigation. Vegetated berms containing marginal plants have been placed along the banks. The project has tried to avoid the installation of revetments, as the vertical faces prevent wildlife accessing the banks, but where a revetment is necessary to combat erosion, it has been built of oak and a berm placed in front of it to soften the edge.|$|E

50|$|Whereas {{previously}} researchers <b>had</b> <b>tended</b> to take riddles out {{of their}} social performance contexts, the rise of anthropology in the post-War period encouraged more researchers to study the social role of riddles and riddling.

Observers point out that many High Courts and certain Supreme Court judges are reluctant to entertain PILs, even those filed by well-known Non-governmental organizations (NGO) and activists, citing concerns of Separation of powers and the parliamentary sovereignty.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} defect of the Central Intelligence Agency is {{that its}} direction, administrative organization and performance do not show sufficient appreciation of the Agency's assigned functions, particularly {{in the fields of}} intelligence coordination and the production of intelligence estimates.
