40|$|Three {{women with}} large, mutilating <b>genital</b> <b>ulcers</b> of long duration, {{destroying}} almost {{the lower half}} of the external genitalia, are reported.

Histopathology of the biopsy from the margin of the ulcer revealed features of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Considering the history, clinical features and histology, a diagnosis of bipolar aphthosis was made in all patients. All patients responded well to immunosuppressive therapy.

40|$|The {{pathogenic}} {{microbial flora}} of <b>genital</b> <b>ulcers</b> in 161 (80 men and 81 women) unselected patients was studied prospectively.

Two or more pathogens were isolated from the ulcers in 67 (41. 6 %) patients, and in 21 (13 %) patients no pathogens were isolated. Our results indicate an urgent need for antiviral treatment to reduce the local reservoir of genital herpes, challenge traditional concepts about the prevalence of H ducreyi in Britain, and call for a reappraisal of its role in the causation of <b>genital</b> <b>ulcers...</b>|$|R
50|$|Genetic {{studies of}} the virus {{suggested}} in 2008 that the most recent common ancestor of the HIV-1 M group {{dates back to the}} Belgian Congo city of Léopoldville (modern Kinshasa), circa 1910. Proponents of this dating link the HIV epidemic with the emergence of colonialism and growth of large colonial African cities, leading to social changes, including a higher degree of non-monogamous sexual activity, the spread of prostitution, and the concomitant high frequency of <b>genital</b> <b>ulcer</b> diseases (such as syphilis) in nascent colonial cities.|$|E
50|$|João Dinis de Sousa, Viktor Müller, Philippe Lemey, and Anne-Mieke Vandamme {{proposed}} that HIV became epidemic through sexual serial transmission, in nascent colonial cities, {{helped by a}} high frequency of genital ulcers, caused by <b>genital</b> <b>ulcer</b> diseases (GUD). GUD are simply sexually transmitted diseases that cause genital ulcers; examples are syphilis, chancroid, lymphogranuloma venereum, and genital herpes. These diseases increase the probability of HIV transmission dramatically, from around 0.01-0.1% to 4-43% per heterosexual act, because the genital ulcers provide a portal of viral entry, and contain many activated T cells expressing the CCR5 co-receptor, the main cell targets of HIV.|$|E
50|$|The main {{result was}} that <b>genital</b> <b>ulcer</b> {{frequency}} {{was by far the}} most decisive factor. For the GUD levels prevailing in Léopoldville in the early 20th century, long chains of SIV transmission had a high probability. For the lower GUD levels existing in the same city in the late 1950s (see above), they were much less likely. And without GUD (a situation typical of villages in forested equatorial Africa before colonialism) SIV could not spread at all. City size was not an important factor. The authors propose that these findings explain the temporal patterns of HIV emergence: no HIV emerging in {{tens of thousands of years}} of human slaughtering of apes and monkeys, several HIV groups emerging in the nascent, GUD-riddled, colonial cities, and no epidemically successful HIV group emerging in mid-20th century, when GUD was more controlled, and cities were much bigger.|$|E

50|$|The authors {{reviewed}} colonial medical {{articles and}} archived medical {{reports of the}} countries {{at or near the}} ranges of chimpanzees, gorillas and sooty mangabeys, and found that <b>genital</b> <b>ulcer</b> diseases peaked in the colonial cities during their early growth period (up to 1935). The colonial authorities recruited men to work in railways, fluvial and sea ports, and other infrastructure projects, and most of these men did not bring their wives with them. Then, the highly male-biased sex ratio favoured prostitution, which in its turn caused an explosion of GUD (especially syphilis and chancroid). After the mid-1930s, people's movements were more tightly controlled, and mass surveys and treatments (of arsenicals and other drugs) were organized, and so the GUD incidences started to decline. They declined even further after World War II, because of the heavy use of antibiotics, so that, by the late 1950s, Léopoldville (which is the probable center of HIV-1 group M) had a very low GUD incidence. Similar processes happened in the cities of Cameroon and Ivory Coast, where HIV-1 group O and HIV-2 respectively evolved.|$|E
