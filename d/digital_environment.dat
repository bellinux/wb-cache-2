5|$|Several {{sets were}} {{rendered}} digitally, {{and almost all}} of the sets had some form of digital enhancement. The largest <b>digital</b> <b>environment</b> was the Devetashka cave, which had to be digitally recreated because of the environmental concerns of filming explosions in the real cave. Using over 5,000 photographs taken at different times of day, the cave was accurately illuminated and rendered down to crevices and moss. The cave's interior containing a concealed nuclear vault was subjected to several changes up to two months before the effects' delivery date based on editorial input, including modifications to its scale. The railcar used within the cave was also digitally built alongside a practical version, but the digital versions versatility saw it largely replace its practical counterpart. The scene featuring the Expendables and prisoners trapped in the cave were shot entirely on Chroma key with the cave background inserted later.|$|E
5|$|The entire opening {{sequence}} of the film was shot in Bulgaria during the winter, but was meant {{to take place in}} tropical South Asia. Digital effects were used to remove the snow and deciduous trees present and replace them with tropical flora. The alterations required over 340 shots alone. The scene was further complicated by Jet Li's scheduling conflict, which meant the interior sets had to be shipped to Hong Kong, reassembled and shot with him there, and the exterior sets had to be digitally built and then merged with footage of Li shot on Chroma key. A fish tank in the opening was filled with digital eels based on South Asian river eels, but increased in size by three times, after the real fish died and sank to the bottom. The finale in the airport was another complex <b>digital</b> <b>environment,</b> shot in three entirely differently locations in two seasons, which were then merged to create one seamless location. When the trucks break through glass to exit the airport, the scene is entirely digital and was filmed on Chroma screens in the middle of Sofia. Numerous digital matte paintings were used to modify the winter Bulgarian terrain in different scenes to represent its intended location.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — <b>Digital</b> <b>environments</b> have {{generated}} tremendous benefits for various entities. Individuals and organizations have utilized these environments for performing transactions, sharing information, {{and engaging in}} collaboration. However, the benefits that <b>digital</b> <b>environments</b> offer also attract a number of dishonest entities. These entities perform malicious activities that further disadvantage other genuine entities. In order to mitigate this issue, a method to investigate the trustworthiness of entities in <b>digital</b> <b>environments</b> is needed prior to any transaction or collaboration. Such method should allow entities to gauge the trustworthiness of other entities. Therefore, this method could increase {{the confidence of the}} entities to perform the transaction or collaboration. In this paper, we focus at providing a holistic review on the current state of art in trust and reputation management system. Several existing works in trust models are discussed. In addition, several requirements for an appropriate trust model for <b>digital</b> <b>environments</b> are presented...|$|R

The study of artificial life imitates traditional biology by recreating some aspects of biological phenomena.

25|$|A 2015 {{study shows}} that 85% of people aged 18 to 34 use social {{networking}} sites for their purchase decision making. While over 65% of people aged 55 and over rely on word of mouth. Several websites are beginning {{to tap into the}} power of the social networking model for philanthropy. Such models provide a means for connecting otherwise fragmented industries and small organizations without the resources to reach a broader audience with interested users. Social networks are providing a different way for individuals to communicate digitally. These communities of hypertexts allow for the sharing of information and ideas, an old concept placed in a <b>digital</b> <b>environment.</b> In 2011, HCL Technologies conducted research that showed that 50% of British employers had banned the use of social networking sites/services during office hours.|$|E
25|$|Secondly, the Internet {{facilitates}} language revitalization. Throughout the years, the <b>digital</b> <b>environment</b> {{has developed}} in various sophisticated ways {{that allow for}} virtual contact. From e-mails, chats to instant messaging, these virtual environments have helped to bridge the spatial distance between communicators. The use of e-mails has been adopted in language courses {{to encourage students to}} communicate in various styles such as conference-type formats and also to generate discussions. Similarly, the use of e-mails facilitates language revitalization in the sense that speakers of a minority language who moved to a location where their native language is not being spoken {{can take advantage of the}} Internet to communicate with their family and friends, thus maintaining the use of their native language. With the development and increasing use of telephone broadband communication such as Skype, language revitalization through the internet is no longer restricted to literate users.|$|E

500|$|The Orphanage {{developed}} a multi-level freeway interchange {{for use in}} one of the film's final scenes by creating a <b>digital</b> <b>environment</b> and a [...] long spiral ramp that was built in front of a bluescreen. When a F-35 jet is chasing McClane on the freeway, a miniature model and a full-size prop were both built to assist in digitally adding the jet into the scene. The nine-foot model was constructed from November 2006 through February 2007. When the jet is shown hovering near the freeway, editors used the software 3D graphics program Maya to blur the background and create a heat ripple effect.|$|E
500|$|Designers {{created the}} alien Mimics to look {{different}} from any terrestrial animal. Davis and Liman favored an early model composed primarily of tentacles. SPI's Dan Kramer described its appearance as [...] "heavy black spaghetti" [...] and noted that the modelers faced a challenge creating the tentacled creatures. A technical animator created an Autodesk Maya plugin that made the movement of each tentacle independent. Since Liman {{did not want the}} Mimics to look [...] "too organic or terrestrial", Imageworks' artists devised the idea of making the aliens out of an obsidian-like material, [...] "basically a glass that could cut". Various debris was incorporated within the tentacles to give the creature a sense of weight and fast movement. The Alphas were given a definable head area to show their status as more sentient, while receiving a different color and a bigger size compared to the Mimic grunts. Cinesite created the mechanical Mimics used in the training areas, while MPC created the Omega in a <b>digital</b> <b>environment</b> into which the effects artists composited underwater footage filmed at Leavesden's water tank.|$|E

2500|$|The {{visual effects}} {{for the film}} were created by Montreal studio Rodeo FX. They spent four months working on the film, and {{according}} to visual effects supervisor Ara Khanikian [...] "visual effects touched 90% of the frames in the movie". A lot of the work was subtle. For example, stitching shots together, or creating the background for {{the windows in the}} hospital scene. Many shots in the film feature mirrors, and much work was spent removing the reflections of the crew from these. To accomplish this the studio created a 2.5D digital matte painting of the reflected environment. They then rotoscoped out the parts of the mirror not containing the foreground actors and their reflections, and replaced these with the <b>digital</b> <b>environment.</b> Some of the original shots captured smudges and dirt on the mirrors, so the studio developed a way to extract them so they could paste them back into the film. A matte-painting was constructed for the night-day time lapses in the film too, created by matchmoving and reprojecting shots of the buildings it features, captured at different times of the day, together. Rodeo FX also adjusted the pace of scenes. Iñárritu demanded a [...] "very precise rhythm and flow" [...] to the film, so the studio had to re-speed much of it with timewarp curves to fit the pacing the director desired.|$|E

40|$|The {{notion of}} {{mentoring}} is ancient. The original mentor {{was described by}} Homer as the 'wise and trusted counsellor' who Odysseus left in charge of his household during his travels. In modern times, the concept of mentoring has found application in virtually every forum of learning. Greater use of communication technologies has provided significant opportunities for relationships to form and grow in <b>digital</b> <b>environments</b> and with the ease of linking dispersed individuals and groups using these technologies, opportunities for interaction and collaboration are extensive. This paper investigates the concept of collaborative mentoring in <b>digital</b> <b>environments</b> and explores strategies and technological tools for supporting and developing shared meaning and conducting rational discourse. The ascilite pilot Collaborative Community Mentoring Program (C²MP) is provided as an example. An early attempt at building a model for collaborative mentoring in <b>digital</b> <b>environments</b> is explored using an adaptation of a three-element Community of Practice framework, progress of the pilot mentoring program is reported and a process for evaluating the pilot is outlined. ...|$|R

40|$|Creative SMEs face {{a number}} of {{limitations}} that can hamper their ability to develop and establish original content in <b>digital</b> <b>environments.</b> These limitations include a lack of resources, struggles for visibility, limits of engagement, audience pressures and free culture. The constant pressures from growing competition and fragmented audiences across <b>digital</b> <b>environments</b> amplify these limitations, which means SMEs can struggle in these highly competitive, information rich platforms. Research sought to explore how creative SMEs may circumvent these limitations to strengthen their positioning in <b>digital</b> <b>environments.</b> Two areas of focus are proposed to address these issues; firstly a study and development of audience engagement, and secondly {{an analysis of the}} monetisation options available for digital content and their links to engagement. With a focus on audience engagement the theoretical grounding of this work is based within the engagement literature. Through this work a new Dynamic Shaping of Engagement is developed and used as a foundation of analysis, which informs the development of practical work in this study. Findings present insight into the methods and practices that can help creative SMEs circumvent their limitations and strengthen their positioning within <b>digital</b> <b>environments.</b> However, the findings continue to emphasise the difficulties faced by creative SMEs. These companies are hampered by paradoxes that arise due to their resource limitations that limit their ability to gain finances, develop audiences and produce content. It is shown that those with the ‘key’ to audience attention are the ones best positioned to succeed in these environments, often {{at the expense of the}} original content creators themselves. Therefore, visions of a democratic environment, which levels the playing field for SMEs to compete, are diminished and it is argued <b>digital</b> <b>environments</b> may act to amplify the positioning of established media. Therefore, greater support is required to aid these companies, which must look beyond short-term solutions that focus on one-off projects, towards broader, more long-term support. This support can then enhance creative SMEs ability to not only deliver, but also establish and potentially monetise content in <b>digital</b> <b>environments,</b> which in turn can make continued production more sustainable...|$|R
