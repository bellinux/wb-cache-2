5|$|Against Georgia, most critics thought Maryland faced {{its first}} true test. In the first quarter, the Terrapins {{took a quick}} 14–0 lead and held the Bulldogs to six {{offensive}} plays, two of which were punts. In the second quarter, Georgia quarterback Zeke Bratkowski led his team to two consecutive touchdown <b>drives,</b> <b>and</b> the score was 21–13 in favor of Maryland at halftime. Two minutes into the third quarter, Faloney intercepted a Bratkowski pass and returned it for a touchdown. Bratkowski {{was taken out of}} the game after numerous sacks by Stan Jones and Bob Morgan. The 40–13 final result would be the most points the Terrapins allowed during the entire season.|$|E

The east workshops is a single storey limestone building on the western side with an enclosed area to the east. The entire workshops yard was roofed using a light steel truss on steel supports in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Halo: The Flood {{is set in}} {{the year}} 2552. Humanity has colonized {{hundreds}} of worlds across the galaxy, using faster-than-light <b>drives</b> <b>and</b> cryonic sleep to travel between worlds. Without warning, a collective of alien races known as the Covenant began attacking the outlying colonies, brutally exterminating all life by vitrifying the surface of the planets. Humanity, outnumbered and outclassed by the alien's superior technology, wages a losing war against the enemy. After the human bastion of Reach falls to the Covenant, the human ship Pillar of Autumn jumps into Slipspace to lead the Covenant away from Earth.|$|E

The deal was completed in May 1977 just before the National Computer Conference in Dallas, Texas. Roberts got $2 million and the other 500 MITS shareholders (including the Altair co-designer, William Yates) split the rest.|$|E
5|$|In his 1931 {{treatise}} On the Nightmare, Welsh psychoanalyst Ernest Jones {{asserted that}} vampires are symbolic of several unconscious <b>drives</b> <b>and</b> defence mechanisms. Emotions such as love, guilt, and hate fuel {{the idea of}} the return of the dead to the grave. Desiring a reunion with loved ones, mourners may project the idea that the recently dead must in return yearn the same. From this arises the belief that folkloric vampires and revenants visit relatives, particularly their spouses, first.|$|E
5|$|Some USB devices {{require more}} power than is {{permitted}} by the specifications for a single port. This is common for external hard and optical disc <b>drives,</b> <b>and</b> generally for devices with motors or lamps. Such devices can use an external power supply, which is allowed by the standard, or use a dual-input USB cable, one input of which is used for power and data transfer, the other solely for power, which makes the device a non-standard USB device. Some USB ports and external hubs can, in practice, supply more power to USB devices than required by the specification but a standard-compliant device may not depend on this.|$|E

5|$|The {{combined}} {{analysis of}} imaging, mass spectrometry, and magnetospheric data {{suggests that the}} observed south polar plume emanates from pressurized subsurface chambers, similar to Earth's geysers,. The mechanism that <b>drives</b> <b>and</b> sustains the eruptions {{is thought to be}} tidal heating. The intensity of the eruption of the south polar jets varies significantly {{as a function of the}} position of Enceladus in its orbit. The plumes are about four times brighter when Enceladus is at apoapsis (the point in its orbit most distant from Saturn) than when it is at periapsis. This is consistent with geophysical calculations which predict the south polar fissures are under compression near periapsis, pushing them shut, and under tension near apoapsis, pulling them open.|$|E
