50|$|As well as {{ensuring}} the <b>door</b> <b>is</b> hung properly and squarely, {{it is also}} very important that where a fire <b>door</b> <b>is</b> installed, any gaps left in the opening between {{the wall and the}} <b>door</b> frame must <b>be</b> properly filled with fire resisting material. Fire <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> normally installed by a carpenter.|$|R

5|$|The {{courthouse}} is elaborately windowed. Some windows, {{mostly on}} the first floor are straight topped. On the second floor most of the windows are topped with limestone arches. The original, wood-framed windows were replaced in 1972. The building's two main entrances feature stone arches over recessed doors; eleven step stairways lead to both doors. New <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> installed in both entrances in 1971.|$|E
5|$|At least 200 people fell or {{jumped to}} their deaths from the burning towers (as {{exemplified}} in the photograph The Falling Man), landing {{on the streets and}} rooftops of adjacent buildings hundreds of feet below. Some occupants of each tower above the point of impact made their way toward the roof in hope of helicopter rescue, but the roof access <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> locked. No plan existed for helicopter rescues, and the combination of roof equipment and thick smoke and intense heat prevented helicopters from approaching.|$|E
50|$|Car {{manufacturing}} industry:The {{automotive industry}} {{is an industry}} where high-speed <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> well known. High volumes of cars are produced in short periods of time. High-speed <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> vital for the logistics processes, high speed and low maintenance ensures optimum production. Special high-speed folding <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> used on the dynamo tuning cells.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuel tank}} access <b>door</b> <b>was</b> {{installed}} {{on the right side}} for all versions sold internationally, however, for the LHD models, and the sliding <b>door</b> <b>was</b> on the right side, care needed to be taken to avoid opening the sliding <b>door</b> when fuel <b>was</b> being added to the fuel tank. An interlock prevented the sliding door from opening too far when the fuel filler <b>door</b> <b>was</b> open.|$|R

5|$|By 1614, {{the ditch}} outside the walls {{appears to have}} been {{partially}} filled in and the reclaimed land rented out. During the English Civil War, Canterbury was initially held by Parliamentary forces. In 1647, however, riots broke out in protest over the actions of the city's Puritan mayor and Canterbury declared its loyalty for Charles I. Parliamentary forces intervened and reoccupied the city, burning the wooden city gates and deliberately damaging, or slighting, the walls near Canterbury Castle. With the restoration of Charles II to the throne in 1660, new wooden <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> installed at the West Gate.|$|E
5|$|His {{body was}} cut down {{after an hour}} by the hangman, John Foxton, who claimed Corder's {{trousers}} and stockings according to his rights. The body was taken back to the courtroom at Shire Hall, where it was slit open along the abdomen to expose the muscles. The crowds were allowed to file past until six o'clock, when the <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> shut. According to the Norwich and Bury Post, over 5,000 people queued to see the body.|$|E
5|$|On 3 December 1979, a crowd crush at a Who gig at the Riverfront Coliseum, Cincinnati killed 11 fans. This {{was partly}} due to the festival seating, where the first to enter get the best positions. Some fans waiting outside mistook the band's soundcheck for the concert, and {{attempted}} to force their way inside. As only a few entrance <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> opened, a bottleneck situation ensued with thousands trying to gain entry, and the crush became deadly.|$|E
50|$|Plug <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> {{often used}} on {{refrigerated}} freight cars and shipping containers. These tight-fitting <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> highly insulated and have locking mechanisms that wedge {{the door into}} place.|$|R

5|$|The Buddhists in Saigon {{were aware}} that a raid on the pagodas was imminent. Buddhist {{relatives}} of Special Forces and combat police personnel had tipped off the monks, and Buddhists who lived near pagodas had observed them move into {{the region in the}} lead-up. American journalists were tipped off and traveled through Saigon to visit the pagodas ahead of the raids. The pagodas had been locked by the monks in preparation for the attacks and the <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> barricaded with furniture and reinforced by nailing wooden planks across them. The monks told members of the U.S. press corps in Saigon that the raids were coming, allowing them to be more prepared for the event than the U.S. embassy.|$|E
5|$|The Fakahani Mosque exemplifies this process. It {{was built}} in the Fatimid period, either as a {{suspended}} mosque (one with shops underneath it) or with a high basement. After the earthquake of 1302 it was rebuilt. In 1440 an ablution basin was added, and early in the Ottoman period a minaret was built. The amir Ahmad Katkhuda Mustahfazan al-Kharbutli in 1735 ordered a major reconstruction, almost all of the original building being replaced apart from two doors. These finely carved <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> registered as a historical monument in 1908 by the committee of conservation, and the building itself was registered in 1937.|$|E
5|$|The Mitsubishi Electric {{propulsion}} system was retained, having performed better than expected. The wheelchair space was made {{available on the}} end of two mid-train cars, nearest to the lifts in above-ground stations. LED displays that blink to warn passengers of closing <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> introduced in the upper middle section of the door. Additional loudspeakers and advertisement panels were also introduced. Hand grips were moved to the support bars of the seats on the ceiling and grabpoles were located near the doors and at both ends of each carriage. The air-conditioning system was modified to match the system used in the C751B cars, with air-conditioning vents and in-flow fans installed.|$|E

50|$|On the dau wall, {{next to the}} llotgeta there's {{a wooden}} door to the patio, this <b>door</b> <b>is</b> {{normally}} open to allow casual spectators some indirect vision {{of the game and}} it becomes another place where the players aim the ball, in order to tamper the rival's back shot. Also, when the <b>door</b> <b>is</b> closed, the rebounds on the wooden <b>door</b> <b>are</b> unpredictable.|$|R
50|$|The heater body is {{provided}} with access doors at various locations. Access <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> to be used only during shutdown of heater. The normal size of the access <b>door</b> <b>is</b> 600x400 mm, which is sufficient for movement of men/ material {{into and out of}} the heater. During operation the access <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> properly bolted using leak proof high temperature gaskets.|$|R
5|$|The {{building}} is {{designed in the}} Italianate style, with the specialty leanings demanded by a schoolhouse. The front facade, which faces southwest today, is adorned with three doorways—left, right, and center— which span a front porch beneath the bell tower. When the school was open, {{the use of the}} doors was restricted. The left and right <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> used by boys in first through eighth grades while the middle door was earmarked as an entry for girls of all ages. Each of the doors feature transoms topped with cornices.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} {{retained the}} aluminium body panels of the XJ220 concept, {{but for the}} production vehicles, Abbey Panels of Coventry were contracted to provide the exterior panels. The scissor <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> dropped for the production model, and significant redesign work was carried out on the design when the wheelbase and overall length of the car was altered. Geoff Lawson, Design Director at Jaguar took a greater interest {{in the car and}} insisted the design had to be seen to be a Jaguar if it was to be successful in promoting the company. Keith Helfet returned to undertake the necessary redesign work mandated by the change in the wheelbase, which was reduced by 200mm.|$|E
5|$|The {{industrial}} fire {{claimed the}} lives of at least ten people, who were unable to escape because the <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> locked shut illegally. Authorities, in response to local residents' angry criticism, admitted that the emergency response to the accident was substandard. Two separate investigations were launched. One inquiry focused on the fire itself, while the other sought to ascertain criminal responsibility for the disaster as well as the operation of the illegal factory. The results of both are either pending or have yet to be released to the general public.|$|E
5000|$|The front <b>door</b> <b>is</b> not original. It was {{originally}} {{topped by a}} classic fanlight and sidelights. [...] The small portico now above the <b>door</b> in front <b>was</b> added when the original <b>door</b> <b>was</b> sold during the 1930s, according to town legend.|$|R

5|$|The train <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> {{originally}} designed to be opened and closed automatically and the doors would re-open if an object blocked them, much as elevator doors do. Almost immediately after the system opened in 1976 Metro realized these features were not conducive to safe or efficient operation and they were disabled. At present the doors may be opened automatically or manually. If a door tries to close and it meets an obstruction, the operator must re-open the door.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial began}} at 10:00am on Christmas Eve 1828 before the High Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh's Parliament House. The case was {{heard by the}} Lord Justice-Clerk, David Boyle, {{supported}} by the Lords Meadowbank, Pitmilly and Mackenzie. The court was full shortly after the <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> opened at 9:00am, and a large crowd gathered outside Parliament House; 300 constables were on duty to prevent disturbances, while infantry and cavalry were on standby as a further precaution.|$|E
5|$|Between March 1926 and September 1928, the CLR {{converted}} the remaining gate stock carriages in phases. The end platforms were enclosed {{to provide additional}} passenger accommodation and two sliding <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> inserting in each side. The conversions increased capacity and allowed the CLR to remove gatemen from the train crews, with responsibility for controlling doors moving to the two guards who each managed half the train. Finally, the introduction of driver/guard communications in 1928 allowed the CLR to dispense with the second guard, reducing a train crew to just a driver and a guard. The addition of doors in the sides of cars caused problems at Wood Lane where {{the length of the}} platform {{on the inside of the}} returning curve was limited by an adjacent access track into the depot. The problem was solved by the introduction of a pivoted section of platform which usually sat above the access track and allowed passengers to board trains as normal, but which could be moved to allow access to the depot.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the terms}} {{are often used}} interchangeably, {{platform}} screen doors can refer to both full-height and half-height barriers. Full height platform screen <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> total barriers between the station floor and ceiling, while the half-height platform screen <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> referred to as platform edge doors, as they do not reach the ceiling and thus do not create a total barrier. The half-screen <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> usually {{only half of the}} height of the full-screen doors, but they sometimes reach to the height of the train. These two types of platform screen <b>doors</b> <b>are</b> presently the main types in the world.|$|R
50|$|The {{long-haul}} layout {{featured a}} four seats per row, with central aisle and forward door. Driver had a separate {{door to the}} driving compartment. The capacity of long-haul NDO buses was 42 passengers. The short-haul layout featured wider aisle with seats arranged along the bus walls facing aisle. The folding <b>door</b> <b>was</b> located {{in the center of}} the bus body. The short-haul layout had the 65 passengers capacity, with 27 seats. Also, a short-hail version with the two <b>doors</b> <b>was</b> made. The front <b>door</b> <b>was</b> still operated from the driver`s compartment, while the rear <b>door</b> <b>was</b> operated by the conductor.|$|R
