40|$|A {{system for}} {{coupling}} two bodies together and for transmitting torque from one body to another with mechanical timing and sequencing is reported. The mechanical timing and sequencing is handled {{so that the}} following criteria are met: (1) the bodies are handled in a safe manner and nothing floats loose in space, (2) electrical connectors are engaged {{as long as possible}} so that the internal processes can be monitored throughout by sensors, and (3) electrical and mechanical power and signals are coupled. The first body has a splined driver for providing the input torque. The second body has a threaded <b>drive</b> <b>member</b> capable of rotation and limited translation. The embedded <b>drive</b> <b>member</b> will mate with and fasten to the splined driver. The second body has an embedded bevel gear member capable of rotation and limited translation. This bevel gear member is coaxial with the threaded <b>drive</b> <b>member.</b> A compression spring provides a preload on the rotating threaded member, and a thrust bearing is used for limiting the translation of the bevel gear member so that when the bevel gear member reaches the upward limit of its translation the two bodies are fully coupled and the bevel gear member then rotates due to the input torque transmitted from the splined driver through the threaded <b>drive</b> <b>member</b> to the bevel gear member. An output bevel gear with an attached output drive shaft is embedded in the second body and meshes with the threaded rotating bevel gear member to transmit the input torque to the output drive shaft...|$|E

40|$|AbstractModern {{electromagnetic}} actuators, {{in particular}} proportional solenoids, are complex mechatronic systems, including both an actuator and its control system. Electromagnetic actuators {{are often used}} in control systems of increased liability and therefore continuously evolving. The development of new types of electromagnetic actuators is based on experimental configuring of parameters of regulators and comprehensive product testing. The complexity and the continuous improvement of the currently used magnetic systems require new approaches to the management of high-precision position of the movable elements. This article discusses an integrated approach to research, monitoring, diagnostics and control of DC proportional solenoids. This approach is based on sensorless measuring of the complex flux-ampere characteristics of the electromagnetic system employed detecting malfunctions, and for determining {{the position of the}} movable <b>drive</b> <b>member...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that the government bond markets in the Eurozone are more fragile and more susceptible to self-fulfilling liquidity crises than in stand-alone countries. We find evidence that {{a significant part of the}} surge in the spreads of the peripheral Eurozone countries during 2010 â€“ 11 was disconnected from underlying increases in the debt to GDP ratios and fiscal space variables, and was associated with negative self-fulfilling market sentiments that became very strong since the end of 2010. We argue that this can <b>drive</b> <b>member</b> countries of the Eurozone into bad equilibria. We also find evidence that after years of neglecting high government debt, investors became increasingly worried about this in the Eurozone, and reacted by raising the spreads. No such worries developed in stand-alone countries despite the fact that debt to GDP ratios and fiscal space variables were equally high and increasing in these countries. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Two input {{members and}} two {{concentric}} rotatable output members are interconnected by a planetary gear arrangement. The first input drives directly the first output. The second input engages a carrier having the planetary gears affixed thereto. Rotation {{of the carriage}} causes rotation of the central sun gear of the planetary gear system. The sun gear is journaled to the carriage and is drivingly connected to the second output through a direction reversing set of bevel gears. The first input <b>drive</b> <b>member</b> includes a ring gear drivingly connected to the planetary gears for driving the second output member {{in the same direction}} and by the same amount as the first output member. Motion of the first input results in equal motion of the two outputs while input motion of the second input results in movement of the second output relative to the first output.

The driving and <b>driven</b> <b>members</b> are separated by a silicone-based fluid and a valve controlled by a bimetallic spring. When the temperature is low, the spring winds and closes the valve, which lets the fan spin at about 20% to 30% of the shaft speed. As {{the temperature of the}} spring rises, it unwinds and opens the valve, allowing fluid past the valve, makes the fan spin at about 60% to 90% of shaft speed. Other clutchesâ€”such as for an air conditioning compressorâ€”electronically engage clutches using magnetic force to couple the driving <b>member</b> to the <b>driven</b> <b>member.</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose â€“ The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide {{platforms}} for members to exchange information by information-based online communities (IBOCs, like LinkedIn or Facebook). Because member participation is vital for IBOCs, this research aims to identify and validate factors that <b>drive</b> <b>member</b> participation. Design/methodology/approach â€“ With reference to social exchange theory the authors developed a model of antecedents of participation in IBOCs that was tested with survey data using PLS. Because some of the results contradicted the theory, the authors examined those results in a mainly qualitative study with online community providers. These experts offered explanations that inform the discussion and managerial implications. Findings â€“ Role clarity, providerâ€™s responsiveness, and enjoyment all influence member participation. Contrary to theory, the cooperation of other members affects member participation negatively while a memberâ€™s ability shows no effect. Practical implications â€“ This research has several implications for IBOC providers. Because ability does not affect participation directly, providers do not need to worry about lacking ability and can effectively target all potential members. The importance of provider responsiveness signals that IBOC providers should proactively monitor membersâ€™ compliance with social norms to lower the social risk for members. The impact of community-specific knowledge and enjoyment on participation puts emphasis on careful community design and the thoughtful implementation of new features that might enhance enjoyment, but reduce role clarity. Originality/value â€“ Whereas most of the participation literature focusses on a dyadic relationship, the research investigates the triadic relationship in which the provider is only an enabler of exchange. Furthermore, the authors bring together two streams of the literature: the participation literature, which tends to focus on offline participation; and the online community literature, which has not yet investigated participation. This is also the first paper to investigate nonlinear effects on participation.
