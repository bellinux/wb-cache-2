5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{may also}} occur in {{someone who is}} receiving mechanical ventilation, in which case {{it may be difficult}} to spot as the person is typically receiving sedation; it is often noted because of a sudden deterioration in condition. Recent studies have shown that the development of tension features may not always be as rapid as previously thought. Deviation of the trachea to one side and the presence of raised jugular venous pressure (<b>distended</b> neck veins) are not reliable as clinical signs.|$|E
5|$|Low oxygen levels lead to hypoxic {{pulmonary}} vasoconstriction, the {{tightening of}} small {{blood vessels in}} the lung to create an optimal distribution of blood through the lung. Persistently low oxygen levels causing chronic vasoconstriction leads to increased pressure on the pulmonary artery (pulmonary hypertension), which in turn puts strain on the right ventricle, the part of the heart that pumps blood to the lungs. The right ventricle undergoes remodeling, becomes <b>distended</b> and is less able to remove blood from the veins. When this is the case, raised hydrostatic pressure leads to accumulation of fluid in the skin (edema), and in more severe cases the liver and the abdominal cavity.|$|E
5|$|The queen only lays 10–20 eggs in {{the very}} early stages of the colony, but lays as many as 1,000 a day when the colony is several years old. At maturity, a primary queen has a great {{capacity}} to lay eggs. In some species, the mature queen has a greatly <b>distended</b> abdomen and may produce 40,000 eggs a day. The two mature ovaries may have some 2,000 ovarioles each. The abdomen increases the queen's body length to several times more than before mating and reduces her ability to move freely; attendant workers provide assistance.|$|E
40|$|Campylobacter jejuni is {{a common}} cause of {{pediatric}} diarrhea worldwide. Cytolethal <b>distending</b> toxin, produced by Campylobacter jejuni, is a putative virulence factor that induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in eukaryotic cells. Cellular cholesterol, {{a major component of}} lipid rafts, has a pivotal role in regulating signaling transduction and protein trafficking as well as pathogen internalization. In this study, we demonstrated that cell intoxication by Campylobacter jejuni cytolethal <b>distending</b> toxin is through the association of cytolethal <b>distending</b> toxin subunits and membrane cholesterol-rich microdomains. Cytolethal <b>distending</b> toxin subunits cofractionated with detergent-resistant membranes, while the distribution reduced upon the depletion of cholesterol, suggesting that cytolethal <b>distending</b> toxin subunits are associated with lipid rafts. The disruption of cholesterol using methyl-beta-cyclodextrin not only reduced the binding activity of cytolethal <b>distending</b> toxin subunits on the cell membrane but also impaired their delivery and attenuated toxin-induced cell cycle arrest. Accordingly, cell intoxication by cytolethal <b>distending</b> toxin was restored by cholesterol replenishment. These findings suggest that membrane cholesterol plays a critical role in the Campylobacter jejuni cytolethal <b>distending</b> toxin-induced pathogenesis of host cells...|$|R
5000|$|Compliance is {{the ability}} of a hollow organ (vessel) to <b>distend</b> and {{increase}} volume with increasing transmural pressure or the tendency of a hollow organ to resist recoil toward its original dimensions on application of a <b>distending</b> or compressing force.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: 1) To {{investigate}} {{the possibility of}} estimating respiratory system impedance (Zrs, forced oscillation technique) by using high-amplitude pressure oscillations delivered during high-frequency oscillatory ventilation; 2) to characterize the relationship between Zrs and continuous <b>distending</b> pressure during an increasing/decreasing continuous <b>distending</b> pressure trial; 3) to evaluate how the optimal continuous <b>distending</b> pressure identified by Zrs relates {{to the point of}} maximal curvature of the deflation limb of the quasi-static pressure-volume curve. DESIGN: Prospective laboratory animal investigation. SETTING: Experimental medicine laboratory. SUBJECTS: Eight New Zealand rabbits. INTERVENTIONS: The rabbits were ventilated with high-frequency oscillatory ventilation. Zrs was measured while continuous <b>distending</b> pressure was increased and decreased between 2 and 26 cm H 2 O in 1 -minute steps of 4 cm H 2 O. At each step, a low-amplitude (6 cm H 2 O) sinusoidal signal was alternated with a high-amplitude (18 cm H 2 O) asymmetric high-frequency oscillatory ventilation square pressure waveform. Pressure-volume curves were determined {{at the end of the}} continuous <b>distending</b> pressure trial. All measurements were repeated after bronchoalveolar lavage. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Zrs was estimated from flow and pressure measured at the inlet of the tracheal tube and expressed as resistance (Rrs) and reactance (Xrs). Linear correlation between the values, measured by applying the small-amplitude sinusoidal signal and the ventilator waveform, was good for Xrs (r = 0. 95 ± 0. 04) but not for Rrs (r = 0. 60 ± 0. 34). Following lavage, the Xrs-continuous <b>distending</b> pressure curves presented a maximum on the deflation limb, identifying an optimal continuous <b>distending</b> pressure that was, on average, 1. 1 ± 1. 7 cm H 2 O below the point of maximal curvature of the deflation limb of the pressure-volume curves. CONCLUSIONS: Xrs can be accurately measured during high-frequency oscillatory ventilation without interrupting ventilation and/or connecting additional devices. An optimal continuous <b>distending</b> pressure close to the point of maximal curvature of the deflation limb of quasi-static pressure-volume curve can be identified by measuring Zrs during a decreasing continuous <b>distending</b> pressure trial. Zrs might constitute a useful bedside tool for monitoring lung mechanics and improving the continuous <b>distending</b> pressure optimization during high-frequency oscillatory ventilation...|$|R
5|$|They {{possess a}} unique feeding {{mechanism}} known as suction feeding. Instead of catching their prey with teeth, it is sucked into their oral cavity. Their tongue can move very freely, and when suddenly retracted {{at the same}} time as the gular floor is <b>distended,</b> the pressure immediately drops within their mouth and the prey is sucked in with the water. The family members are characterized by having a lower jaw that extends at least to the tip of the upper jaw, a shallow or non-existent notch between the tail flukes, a dorsal fin set well back on the body, three of four fused cervical vertebrae, extensive skull asymmetry and two conspicuous throat grooves forming a 'V' pattern.|$|E
5|$|In early March 1704 Beatrix Laing {{approached}} Patrick Morton, a 16-year-old {{working in}} his father's smithy, {{to ask if he}} would make her some nails. Morton refused as he was already assigned an urgent task making nails for a merchant's ship in the harbour. Displeased, Laing left threatening revenge on him. The following day Morton noticed a bucket filled with water and burning coal outside Laing's house; he thought it was there to cast a spell on him. Laing had a reputation as a witch having already appeared before the Kirk session in 1696 for charming. Morton immediately felt weak and had difficulty standing or walking. His health deteriorated; he began to have fits and convulsions, his stomach became <b>distended</b> and his body was rigid and twisted. People claimed they could see marks left on his skin by fingernails where Morton said he had been pinched. He refused food and his breathing was laboured.|$|E
5|$|Liver {{disease may}} present itself as tiredness, {{increased}} bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and portal hypertension. The latter, {{a condition in}} which the pressure in the portal vein is markedly increased, leads to esophageal varices, blood vessels in the esophagus that may bleed in a life-threatening fashion, as well as enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) and accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites). On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider angiomata (small <b>distended</b> blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most by the time they develop symptoms. While most people with cirrhosis have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), this risk is relatively very low in Wilson's disease.|$|E
40|$|An {{association}} between certain Campylobacter species and enterocolitis in humans and nonhuman primates is well established, but the {{association between}} cytolethal <b>distending</b> toxin and disease is incompletely understood. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to examine Campylobacter species isolated from captive conventionally raised macaque monkeys for the presence of the cdtB gene and for cytolethal <b>distending</b> toxin activity. The identity of each isolate was confirmed on the basis of phenotypic and genotypic analyses. The presence of cytolethal <b>distending</b> toxin was confirmed on the basis of characteristic morphological changes in HeLa cells incubated with filter-sterilized whole-cell lysates of reference and monkey Campylobacter isolates and examinations by light microscopy, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry. Although cdtB gene sequences were found in both Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli, the production of cytolethal <b>distending</b> toxin correlated positively (P < 0. 0001) only with C. jejuni. We concluded that cytolethal <b>distending</b> toxin activity is a characteristic of C. jejuni. Our C. jejuni cdtB gene-specific PCR assay might be of assistance for differentiating toxigenic C. jejuni from C. coli in clinical laboratories...|$|R

40|$|Intravascular {{absorption}} of <b>distending</b> media may complicate operative hysteroscopy. Consequences differ according to type, amount {{and speed of}} {{absorption of}} the <b>distending</b> media. We report a case of intravascular absorption {{of more than one}} liter of 1. 5 % glycine. A 36  years old female developed metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia and hypocalcemia during operative hysteroscopy scheduled for resection of a uterine fibroid. Serum sodium reached down to 119  mmol/l and ionized calcium to 0. 898  mmol/l. Serial estimations of arterial blood gases and serum electrolytes were followed. Management was successful in preventing serious side effects. Meticulous monitoring of <b>distending</b> media input/output balance remains the cornerstone in prevention of intravascular absorption...|$|R
5|$|Mating in the tawny {{nurse shark}} is known to occur from July to August off Madagascar. Adult females have one {{functional}} ovary and two functional uteruses. The mode of reproduction is aplacental viviparity, meaning that the embryos hatch inside the uterus; females in captivity have been documented depositing up to 52 non-viable egg capsules, {{which has led to}} erroneous reports of this shark being oviparous. The egg capsules of this species are onion-shaped, with thin, brown, translucent shells. The {{tawny nurse shark}} is the only carpet shark in which there is oophagy: once the developing embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, they gorge on eggs produced by the mother and acquire the <b>distended</b> abdomen characteristic of such oophagous embryos. Unlike in mackerel sharks, the eggs consumed by the embryos are large and shelled rather than small and undeveloped. There is no evidence of sibling cannibalism as in the sand tiger shark (Carcharias taurus).|$|E
5|$|One {{theory is}} that the sculptures {{represent}} deceased individuals with bloated bodies, closed eyes, <b>distended</b> bellies and puffed out faces. The position of the limbs on some monuments, although following the natural contours of the boulder, give an impression of the position of corpses found in later Maya burial bundles. It is possible that Pasaco Monument 2 and the potbelly from San Juan Sacatepéquez portray the placement of a jade bead in the mouth of the sculpture. Although {{it has been suggested that}} the monuments themselves are burial markers, only three sculptures have been found directly associated with human remains. One of these is a ceramic potbelly from Colha in Belize, the others are from Chalchuapa and Kaminaljuyu. However, since most potbelly monuments were not found in their original locations it is impossible to know whether they originally served as burial markers.|$|E

His father tells him that it was his imagination, goes back downstairs, but then screams. Quinton rushes down to find his father dead and his eyes turned red with blood. Doggett and Scully investigate this latest death after the police tell them about the strange man the boy saw.

She rushes to the morgue and finds the boy’s father with a <b>distended</b> belly. She cuts into him and then sees a hand emerge from the scalpel incision. After being temporarily knocked over, she follows a bloody trail, opens a door at the end of the trail, and finds no one there. Unbeknownst to her, however, the beggar is watching her.|$|E

5|$|As Boyce's {{interest}} in philanthropy grew, {{he turned to}} his childhood experiences in the outdoors as a resource, but could not find a way to channel his charitable ideas and dreams until a fateful stop to England while en route to what became the failed photographic expedition to Africa. Events in London on the way to and from this expedition would lead to the founding of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), one of many civic and professional organizations formed during the Progressive Era to fill the void of citizens who had become <b>distended</b> from their rural roots. Many youth organizations such as the Woodcraft Indians and Sons of Daniel Boone formed in America in the early 1900s focusing on outdoor character-building activities. The writings and adventures of Theodore Roosevelt contributed to these movements, with their outdoor, nature, and pioneer themes. By the time of his 1922 expedition to Africa, Boyce was so well respected in Scouting that French Boy Scouts in Algeria saluted him and offered to escort him along a trail when they found out he was the founder of BSA and LSA in America.|$|E

25|$|Hydrosalpinx may be {{diagnosed}} using ultrasonography as the fluid filled elongated and <b>distended</b> tubes display their typical echolucent pattern. However, a small hydrosalpinx may be missed by sonography. During an infertility work-up a hysterosalpingogram (HSG), an X-ray procedure {{that uses a}} contrast agent to image the fallopian tubes, shows the retort-like shape of the <b>distended</b> tubes {{and the absence of}} spillage of the dye into the peritoneum. If, however, there is a tubal occlusion at the utero-tubal junction, a hydrosalpinx may go undetected.

40|$|Bronchograms were {{performed}} using finely particulate lead on emphysematous lungs obtained at necropsy. X-ray films were taken of these lungs at <b>distending</b> pressures of 0, 5, 10, and 20 cm H 2 O. The volumes of individual centrilobular emphysematous spaces were calculated at each <b>distending</b> pressure from measurements made on these bronchograms and pressure-volume curves were constructed for each space. The pressure-volume characteristics of seven normal lungs and one lung with centrilobular emphysema was also measured. The normal lungs, the lung with centrilobular emphysema, and the centrilobular emphysematous spaces were compared by expressing {{the volume of}} air contained in them at each <b>distending</b> pressure as a per cent of the volume contained at 20 cm H 2 O <b>distending</b> pressure. We conclude that centrilobular emphysematous spaces have a high residual volume, are less compliant than normal lung tissue, and are much less compliant than the emphysematous lungs which contain them. Furthermore, these spaces undergo little volume change in the tidal breathing range and probably add a relatively nondistensible series dead space to the surrounding lung parenchyma...|$|R
