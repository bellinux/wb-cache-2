5|$|Attempts {{by three}} tugs from Cardiff {{to remove the}} wreck were unsuccessful, but the next spring tide carried the {{midsection}} up the estuary onto Town Bar, opposite Padstow, where it was a hazard to shipping. A miner named Pope {{was called in to}} remove it: he used <b>gelignite</b> without success, though the explosion was reported to have broken many windows in the town. In 2010 a wreck, identified as almost certainly the Antoinette, surfaced on Town Bar. The Royal Navy Bomb Disposal Unit failed to demolish it and it was marked with a buoy; in March 2011 work started to demolish the remainder of it using saws.|$|E

50|$|Many {{practical}} commercial {{materials of}} intermediate sensitivity, such as <b>gelignites</b> and water gel explosives, {{can be safely}} handled as they will not explode from casual shocks such as being dropped or lightly knocked by a tool. However they may explode if struck forcefully by a metal tool, and would certainly explode in the barrel if they were used in an artillery shell. Reliable initiation of such materials requires the small explosion of a detonator.|$|R
50|$|A few {{materials}} such as nitrogen triiodide cannot be touched at all without detonating, and so are of purely academic interest. Some other compounds with a high sensitivity to shock, such as nitroglycerin and acetone peroxide, may detonate from a firm jolt and so cannot be legally transported in pure form. Acetone peroxide is often used by amateurs and terrorists {{as a means to}} detonate other explosives as well as acting as the main blasting agent, often resulting in injuries or death to those who underestimate its sensitivity. A number of methods are known to desensitize nitroglycerine {{so that it can be}} transported for medical uses, and it is also incorporated into other less sensitive explosives, such as dynamites and <b>gelignites.</b>|$|R

25|$|During {{the general}} {{reduction}} in naval activity imposed {{by lack of}} finance during the Great Depression, {{it was decided to}} scrap Torrens and her five sister ships. On 24 November 1930, after being stripped of useful materials, Torrens was towed outside Sydney Heads by the tug Heroic, and was used for gunnery target practice. The destroyer withstood considerable shelling before being scuttled by a charge of <b>gelignite.</b>|$|E
25|$|The trial {{revealed}} that the fuse for the consulate bomb was sent from Turkey to Thessaloniki on 3 September. During the Yassıada Trial it was claimed that a twenty-year-old university student named Oktay Engin was given the mission of installing the explosives, two sticks of <b>gelignite,</b> in the consulate's garden. The consul M. Ali Balin allegedly first pressured consulate employee Hasan Uçar, but Engin was brought in when Uçar resisted. Both of them were arrested after the attack.|$|E
25|$|Although {{attempts}} by three tugs from Cardiff {{to remove the}} largest piece of the wreck were unsuccessful, the next spring tide carried it up the estuary onto Town Bar, opposite the port of Padstow, where it was a hazard to shipping. A miner named Pope {{was called in to}} remove it: he manoeuvred a box filled with <b>gelignite</b> underneath the wreck and detonated it after clearing the area. The resulting explosion was so violent that reports claim every window in the nearby harbour of Padstow was blown in and the smoke could be seen three miles (5 km) away.|$|E
25|$|The Antoinette was a 1,118 ton barque, {{built in}} Yarmouth, Nova Scotia in 1874 {{and was used}} for the {{transportation}} of goods. She struck land on Tuckernuck in 1889, requiring the entire crew to be rescued. Although she was reinstated later that year, she was finally wrecked on the Doom Bar on the north coast of Cornwall; the largest ship to be wrecked there. The majority of the wreck ended up on the Town Bar off Padstow and mostly disappeared after being destroyed with <b>gelignite.</b> However some of the hull re-emerged in March 2010, creating a hazard to local shipping.|$|E
25|$|On {{the same}} day, in {{unconnected}} circumstances, {{two members of}} the Royal Irish Constabulary guarding <b>gelignite</b> were killed in the Soloheadbeg Ambush by members of the Irish Volunteers. Although it had not ordered this incident, the course of events soon drove the Dáil to recognise the Volunteers as the army of the Irish Republic and the ambush as an act of war against Great Britain. The Volunteers therefore changed their name, in August, to the Irish Republican Army. In this way the 1918 elections led to the outbreak of the Anglo-Irish War, giving the impression that the election sanctioned the war.|$|E
25|$|In the {{depression}} between Branstree and High Howes {{is a small}} tarn {{and the remains of}} a survey pillar. This unusual stone and concrete construction is cleft at the top to provide a sight line and was originally surrounded by a wooden frame, now decayed. This is one of four such pillars built during the construction of the Haweswater aqueduct. Below Branstree, Tarn Crag and Great Howe is the first section of the pipeline carrying water from the reservoir toward Manchester. The tunnel, some 1,300ft below this point, required 250 tons of <b>gelignite</b> for blasting, and when constructed in the 1930s was the longest such pipeline in Britain. It emerges into Longsleddale below the southern end of Great Howe, where the spoil can still be seen.|$|E
25|$|The Irish War of Independence {{in effect}} {{began on the}} day that the First Dáil convened, 21 January 1919. On that date, an ambush party of IRA volunteers from the 3rd Tipperary Brigade {{including}} Séamus Robinson, Dan Breen, Seán Treacy and Seán Hogan, attacked a pair of Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) men who were escorting a consignment of <b>gelignite</b> to a quarry in Soloheadbeg, County Tipperary. The two policemen were shot dead during the engagement. This ambush is considered the first action in the Irish War of Independence. The engagement had no advance authorisation from the nascent government. However, Collins in Dáil discussion of the incident implicitly accepted responsibility on behalf of the IRB. The legislature's support for the armed struggle soon after became official.|$|E
25|$|The main form of {{collective}} punishment {{employed by the}} British forces was destruction of property. Sometimes entire villages were reduced to rubble, as happened to Mi'ar in October 1938; more often several prominent houses were blown up and others were trashed inside. The biggest single act of destruction occurred in Jaffa on 16 June 1936, when large <b>gelignite</b> charges were used to cut long pathways through the old city, destroying 220–240 buildings and rendering up to 6,000 Arabs homeless. Scathing criticism for this action from Palestine Chief Justice Sir Michael McDonnell was not well received by {{the administration and the}} judge was soon removed from the country. Villages were also frequently punished by fines and confiscation of livestock. The British even used sea mines from the battleship HMS Malaya to destroy houses.|$|E
25|$|With regular police {{raids on}} people {{known to be}} {{supportive}} of the Angry Brigade and with Mendleson a wanted person (although for cheque fraud only), the police were interested in finding any addresses where she might be found. Mendleson was keeping in regular touch with her family in Stockport and a police informer there passed the Amhurst Road address to police on 18 August 1971. An observation was set up and when Jim Greenfield was seen leaving the flat, a search warrant was obtained. At 4:15 PM on 20 August the police entered the flat and arrested Mendleson, Creek, Barker and Greenfield. Mendleson again gave her name as 'Nancy Pye'. The police reported that their searches of 359 Amhurst Road discovered not only duplicating equipment on which Angry Brigade publications had been produced, but a stick of <b>gelignite,</b> two submachine guns, a Browning pistol and 81 rounds of ammunition. Mendleson was remanded in custody at Holloway Prison and was eventually charged with possession of the armaments and conspiracy to cause explosions. Mendleson's fingerprints were found on a copy of Rolling Stone magazine used to wrap a bomb planted at the Italian consulate in Manchester, and she was also charged with attempting to cause this explosion.|$|E
500|$|No further {{information}} was forthcoming until 2000, when during a Raidió Teilifís Éireann interview a former IRA member, Liam Sutcliffe {{claimed he had}} placed the bomb which detonated in the Pillar. In the 1950s [...] Sutcliffe {{was associated with a}} group of dissident volunteers led by Joe Christle (1927–98), who had been expelled from the IRA in 1956 for [...] "recklessness". [...] In early 1966 Sutcliffe learned that Christle's group was planning [...] "Operation Humpty Dumpty", an attack on the Pillar, and offered his services. According to Sutcliffe, on 28 February he placed a bomb within the Pillar, timed to go off {{in the early hours of}} the next morning. The explosive was a mixture of <b>gelignite</b> and ammonal. It failed to detonate; Sutcliffe says that he returned early the next morning, recovered the device and redesigned its timer. On 7 March, shortly before the Pillar closed for the day, he climbed the inner stairway and placed the refurbished bomb near to the top of the shaft before going home. [...] He learned of the success of his mission the next day, he says, having slept undisturbed through the night. Following his revelations, Sutcliffe was questioned by the police but not charged. He did not name [...] others involved in the action, apart from Christle and his brother.|$|E
500|$|The escape {{resulted}} in all IRA prisoners {{being held at}} Mountjoy Prison and Curragh Camp being transferred to the maximum security Portlaoise Prison. In order to prevent any further escapes {{the perimeter of the}} prison was guarded by members of the Irish Army, and wires were erected over the prison yard to prevent any future helicopter escape. Cosgrave stated there would be [...] "no hiding place" [...] for the escapees, and a manhunt involving twenty thousand members of the Irish Defence Forces and Garda Síochána ensued. Mallon was recaptured at a Gaelic Athletic Association dance in a hotel near Portlaoise on 10 December 1973, and imprisoned in Portlaoise Prison. He escaped from there in a mass break-out on 18 August 1974, when nineteen prisoners escaped after overpowering guards and using <b>gelignite</b> to blast through the gates. He was recaptured in Foxrock in January 1975 and returned to Portlaoise Prison. O'Hagan was recaptured in Dublin in early 1975, and also imprisoned in Portlaoise Prison. After the end of his original twelve-month sentence, he was immediately arrested and sentenced to a further two years imprisonment for escaping. Twomey evaded recapture until 2 December 1977, when he was spotted sitting in a car in Sandycove by members of the Garda's Special Branch who were investigating an arms shipment after a tip-off from police in Belgium. Twomey drove away after spotting the officers, before being recaptured in the centre of Dublin after a high-speed car chase. He was also imprisoned in Portlaoise Prison until his release in 1982.|$|E
500|$|During the Troubles, Irish republican prisoners {{had escaped}} from custody en masse on several occasions. On 17 November 1971, nine prisoners dubbed the [...] "Crumlin Kangaroos" [...] escaped from Crumlin Road Jail when rope ladders were thrown over the wall. Two prisoners were recaptured, but the {{remaining}} seven managed {{to cross the}} border into the Republic of Ireland and appeared at a press conference in Dublin. On 17 January 1972, seven internees escaped from the prison ship HMS Maidstone by swimming to freedom, resulting in them being dubbed the [...] "Magnificent Seven". On 31 October 1973, three leading IRA members, including former Chief of Staff Seamus Twomey, escaped from Mountjoy Prison in Dublin when a hijacked helicopter landed in the exercise yard of the prison. Irish band The Wolfe Tones wrote a song celebrating the escape called The Helicopter Song, which topped the Irish popular music charts. 19 IRA members escaped from Portlaoise Jail on 18 August 1974 after overpowering guards and using <b>gelignite</b> to blast through gates, and 33 prisoners attempted to escape from Long Kesh on 6 November 1974 after digging a tunnel. IRA member Hugh Coney was shot dead by a sentry, 29 other prisoners were captured within a few yards of the prison, and the remaining three were back in custody within 24 hours. In March 1975, ten prisoners escaped from the courthouse in Newry while on trial for attempting to escape from Long Kesh. The escapees included Larry Marley, who would later be one of the masterminds behind the 1983 escape. (Marley was shot dead by loyalists in 1987.) On 10 June 1981, eight IRA members on remand, including Angelo Fusco, Paul Magee and Joe Doherty, escaped from Crumlin Road Jail. The prisoners took prison officers hostage using three handguns that had been smuggled into the prison, took their uniforms and shot {{their way out of the}} prison.|$|E

An unexploded bomb, found abandoned on a bus, was identified with this material when the arrests were made.|$|E
2500|$|... 23 January - In Manchester {{two women}} were arrested on {{possession}} of explosives. Items seized included one barrel of potassium chlorate, two Mills bombs, 49 sticks of <b>gelignite,</b> and 10 electric detonators. Sir Dawson Bates, then Northern Ireland Minister of Home Affairs, revealed {{the existence of an}} [...] "execution list of NI officials" [...] (which had been seized in Belfast) to the British press.|$|E
2500|$|At 11.58 a.m. a [...] <b>gelignite</b> bomb {{exploded}} inside a green Ford Cortina {{parked in the}} street outside {{the offices of the}} News Letter, shaking the city centre with the force of its blast, and instantly killing the two RUC constables, Ernest McAllister (31) and Bernard O'Neill (36), who had been examining the vehicle. The remains of the two policemen's bodies, which had been blown to pieces, were allegedly found inside a nearby building. Minutes earlier they had been helping to escort people away from Church Street.|$|E
2500|$|The {{principal}} tunnelling {{method used}} during the war was the blast-hole diamond drilling technique, which had only recently been developed. It involved either undercutting the tunnel and bringing down the back using diamond drill blasting– detonating <b>gelignite</b> charges in drill holes spaced between [...] to [...] apart– or excavating the central portion of the tunnel to its full height and diamond drill blasting the sides. The resulting rubble was used to extend the airfield at RAF North Front out into the Bay of Gibraltar.|$|E
2500|$|A {{generation}} earlier, IRA units operating {{during the}} S-Plan / Sabotage campaign {{did not have}} access to the above material, with the exception of <b>Gelignite.</b> [...] IRA explosive devices of the 1930s and 1940s were prepared using materials such as Potassium chlorate, Carbide, Saxonite, Iron Oxide, Aluminium, sulfuric acid etc. [...] By the time of the Northern Campaign (IRA) c. 1942, IRA Eastern Command, in cooperation with IRA Western Command could raise 12 tons of weapons and explosives at short notice. This was excluding the tons of weapons and explosives seized during the S-Plan campaign.|$|E
2500|$|Edward [...] "Ted" [...] Sinclair (from Dungannon) {{was convicted}} of {{possession}} of a Luger pistol (serial number U 4), a [...]38 ACP pistol, homemade machine guns, <b>gelignite</b> and ammunition in 1976. He was released in 1979. Sinclair was arrested again in 1980 and charged with possession of a [...]45 revolver and ammunition. However, charges were withdrawn by the DPP. Sinclair was also charged with the 1976 killings of Peter and Jane McKearney (a married couple mistakenly {{believed to be the}} parents of an IRA volunteer with the same surname, Margaret McKearney, although there was no relation). In 1982 (the following year), these charges were also dropped by the DPP.|$|E
2500|$|... 29 July 1957 – At Bega, New South Wales, Senior Constable Kenneth Desmond Coussens (31), {{his wife}} Elizabeth (34) and 7-month old son Bruce were killed {{instantly}} by a bomb placed on their home's veranda. The house was demolished by the explosion at about 2 AM. 8 year-old Roger McCampbell, Coussens' step-son, survived. A six-gallon metal cream container filled with 240 sticks of <b>gelignite,</b> {{stolen from a}} mine, was placed there by Myron Bertram Kelly. [...] Coussens dealt with Kelly regarding traffic offences and issued him several traffic fines. Kelly appears to have become angered because Coussens issued further fines and defect notices regarding Kelly’s tractor and rotary hoe. On 6 December 1957 Justice McClemens sentenced Kelly to life imprisonment for the 3 murders.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the same}} day as the Declaration of Independence was issued, two members of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) escorting a cartload of <b>gelignite</b> were killed in the Tipperary Soloheadbeg Ambush, carried out by members of the 3rd Tipperary Brigade of the Irish Volunteers, led by Dan Breen and Seán Treacy. This ambush had not been ordered by the Dáil, but the course of events soon drove the Dáil to {{recognise}} the Volunteers as the army of the Irish Republic, and so the Soloheadbeg incident became the opening incident of the undeclared Anglo-Irish War between the Volunteers and Great Britain. Breen later recalled: [...] "Treacy had stated to me that the only way of starting a war was to kill someone, so we intended to kill some of the police.." ...|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the next}} decade Smith's Shaft was sunk to the 40Fathom Level, the 60Fathom Level, and in 1899 to the 75Fathom Level. In 1896 it was fitted with cages and an {{electric}} winding engine, and the old Lucy Engine Shaft was abandoned in 1899. By 1902 all ore production from above the Lucy Level had ceased. In 1904 Smith's Shaft was extended to the 90Fathom Level which became the major working level for many years. A small patch of ore above {{the north end of}} the Lucy Tongue Level was opened up in the 1890s, known as the Alma Workings. [...] <b>Gelignite</b> was introduced in the 1890s, replacing both blasting gelatine and gunpowder. The first carbide lamps were introduced at Greenside from 1909 onwards; before then all work had been done by candlelight.|$|E
2500|$|Following Hanna's orders, {{the three}} car bombs (two of them escorted by a [...] "scout" [...] car, {{to be used}} for the bombers' escape back across the Northern Ireland border) were driven into the city centre of Dublin where they detonated in Parnell Street, Talbot Street, and South Leinster Street, almost {{simultaneously}} at approximately 5.30pm. No warnings were given. From the available forensic evidence derived from material traces at the scene, the bombs are believed to have contained, as their main tertiary explosive a <b>gelignite</b> containing ammonium nitrate, packed into the usual metallic beer barrel container used by loyalists in prior car bombings. Twenty-three people were killed outright in the blasts, including a pregnant woman and her unborn child; three more people would later die of their injuries. The bodies of the dead were mostly unrecognisable. One girl who had been near the epicentre of the Talbot Street explosion was decapitated; only her platform boots provided a clue as to her sex.|$|E
2500|$|Collins ordered Mulcahy {{to accept}} a British offer of two 18-pdr field {{artillery}} {{for use by the}} new army of the Free State, though General Macready gave just 200 shells of the 10,000 he had in store at Richmond barracks in Inchicore. [...] The anti-treaty forces in the Four Courts, who possessed only small arms, surrendered after three days of bombardment and the storming of the building by Provisional Government troops (28–30 June 1922). [...] Shortly before the surrender, a massive explosion destroyed the western wing of the complex, including the Irish Public Record Office (PRO), injuring many advancing Free State soldiers and destroying the records. [...] Government supporters alleged that the building had been deliberately mined. Historians dispute whether the PRO was intentionally destroyed by mines laid by the Republicans on their evacuation or if the explosions occurred when their ammunition store was accidentally ignited by the bombardment. Coogan, however, asserts that two lorry-loads of <b>gelignite</b> was exploded in the PRO, leaving priceless manuscripts floating over the city for several hours afterward.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the success}} of Sinn Féin in the general {{election}} of 1918 and the setting up of the First Dáil (the legislature of the Irish Republic), Volunteers commenced military action against the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC), the paramilitary police force in Ireland, and subsequently against the British Army. It began with the Soloheadbeg Ambush, when members of the Third Tipperary Brigade led by Séamus Robinson, Seán Treacy, Dan Breen and Seán Hogan, seized a quantity of <b>gelignite,</b> killing two RIC constables in the process. The Dáil leadership worried that the Volunteers would not accept its authority, given that, under their own constitution, they were bound to obey their own executive and no other body. In August 1919, Brugha proposed to the Dáil that the Volunteers be asked to swear allegiance to the Dáil, but another year passed before the Volunteers took an oath of allegiance to the Irish Republic and its government, [...] "throughout August 1920". During this time, the Volunteers gradually became known as the Irish Republican Army (IRA).|$|E
2500|$|Several {{hours before}} the surrender, at either 11:30 or 2:15 the Irish Public Record Office located in the western block of the Four Courts, which had been used as an {{ammunition}} store by the Four Courts garrison, {{was the center of}} a huge explosion, destroying 1000 years of Irish state and religious archives. Forty advancing Free State troops were badly injured. It was alleged by the National Army Headquarters that the Anti-treaty forces deliberately booby-trapped the Public Record office to kill advancing Free State troops. Tim Healy, a government supporter, later alleged that the explosion was the result of land mines laid before the surrender, which exploded after the surrender. However, a study of the battle concluded that the explosion was caused by fires ignited by the shelling of the Four Courts, which eventually reached two truck loads of <b>gelignite</b> in the munitions factory. A towering mushroom cloud rose 200 feet over the Four Courts. Calton Younger (1968) identified 3 explosions; [...] ".. two beneath the Records Office at about 2.15 [...] and another {{at the back of the}} building at about 5 o'clock.." ...|$|E
