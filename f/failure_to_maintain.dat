5|$|The {{changes to}} the DDL design {{reflected}} shifting requirements and poor project management by the Navy. The development of an Australian-designed ship customised for Australian conditions caused naval officers to include requirements beyond those which were essential. These changes were made without regard for costs, as the team tasked with developing the specifications was not also responsible for the ships' final price and delivery schedule. The Navy's <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> control of the design requirements and make cost-performance trade-offs {{may have been due}} to its limited experience in overseeing the design of new warships.|$|E
5|$|The {{safety culture}} at WCRC {{was found by}} the {{investigation}} to be weak.

Failure to keep proper records. Failure to improve following the incident at Bell Busk (detailed below).|$|E
5|$|Rwanda's economy {{suffered}} heavily {{during the}} 1994 genocide, with widespread loss of life, <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> infrastructure, looting, and neglect of important cash crops. This caused a large drop in GDP and destroyed the country's {{ability to attract}} private and external investment. The economy has since strengthened, with per-capita GDP (PPP) estimated at $2,090 in 2017, compared with $416 in 1994. Major export markets include China, Germany, and the United States. The economy is managed by the central National Bank of Rwanda and the currency is the Rwandan franc; in August 2015, the exchange rate was 755 francs to the United States dollar. Rwanda joined the East African Community in 2007, and has ratified a plan for monetary union amongst the five member nations, which could eventually lead to a common East African shilling.|$|E

5|$|The Defective Premises Bill was {{introduced}} to the House of Commons as a private member's bill by Ivor Richard on 1 December 1971, and given the Royal Assent on 29 June 1972, coming into force as the Defective Premises Act 1972 on 1 January 1974. The Act establishes a duty of care builders and their sub-contractors owe to the occupiers of property they construct or modify, and also establishes a duty of care landlords hold towards their tenants and any third parties who might be injured by their <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> or repair property. The Act received a mixed reaction from critics; while some complimented it on its simple nature compared to the previously complex common rule laws, others felt that it was too limited for what was desired to be achieved, and that the wording used was at times both too vague and too specific.|$|E
5|$|Biman {{is notable}} for {{disruptions}} to its flight schedule and poor customer service. In 2007, Biman faced strong criticism from major international airports including London Heathrow Airport and Dubai International Airport for its <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> flight schedules. Heathrow Airport operator BAA wrote to Biman providing evidence which showed Biman had not achieved the minimum 80% usage of its allocated landing slots at Heathrow, {{as required by}} EU and International Air Transport Association (IATA) regulations, {{during the summer of}} 2007. Biman should, therefore, not expect slot allocations at Heathrow for the summer of 2008 and should look to Stansted or Gatwick airports if it wished to continue serving London. Following discussions with BAA, however, Biman obtained landing slots for the summer of 2008 on condition that it achieved 80% usage. Delays continued unabated and in September 2008, Biman's Dhaka–London direct flight utilising a DC-10 aircraft was diverted and landed at Gatwick when it did not have sufficient fuel to remain in a holding pattern over Heathrow following arrival over three hours after the scheduled time. In a 10 September 2008 article published in The Times, Biman was labelled the worst performer for punctuality at Heathrow, with flights delayed on average by three hours. In 2008, the United Nations advised its staff not to fly with Biman, citing both safety and security concerns and Biman's unreliable flight schedules. It was made clear that UN staff who flew with Biman did so at their own risk, and would be ineligible to make claims on insurance. Biman's then newly appointed managing director said he was unaware of the UN directive, but admitted that Biman did face problems in managing its flight schedules. He expected the situation to improve with the procurement of aircraft in the coming months.|$|E

2500|$|Around {{that time}} {{administrative}} problems began to arise at the hospital, similar to problems throughout the VA healthcare system {{that emerged in}} 2014.

25|$|Emerton {{notes that}} it is “widely agreed” {{that the story of}} Judah and Tamar “reflects a period after the {{settlement}} of the Israelites in Canaan.” He also suggests the possibility that it contains “aetiological motifs concerned with the eponymous ancestors of the clans of Judah.” Emerton notes that Dillman and Noth considered the account of the deaths of Er and Onan to “reflect the dying out of two clans of Judah bearing their names, or at least of their <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> a separate existence.” However, this view was “trenchantly criticized” by Thomas L.

The exponential growth of wireless devices and services contributes to the increasing number of these dynamic mobile networks, whose changeable characteristics in turn contribute to the high probability of <b>failures.</b> <b>To</b> <b>maintain</b> the high level of connectivity required for the overall ambient networks environment, it is imperative <b>to</b> <b>maintain</b> the same level of connectivity in various network parts.

Divided drive, although it did reduce the total stress/strain on the centre crank axle, did not lend itself to frame integrity, especially coupled with connecting rods of equal length, as the greatest point of rigidity in the frame structure itself, the cylinders, were no longer lined up. Locomotive frames are flexible to handle side-to-side twist, and even axial twist along their length, but fore-and-aft motion between the frames leads to bearing and joint <b>failures.</b> <b>To</b> <b>maintain</b> connecting rods of equal length required the inside cylinder to be placed as far forward as possible, and even so the outside cylinders were behind the rear axle of the front bogie, which was not LNER practice, and subsequently resulted in a very long wheelbase.|$|R
