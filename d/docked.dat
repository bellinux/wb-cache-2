5000|$|<b>Dock</b> {{levelers}} {{are more}} expensive devices than the comparatively light-weight <b>dock</b> plates and <b>dock</b> boards.

Safety, also, is very high for this kind of product: Safety rules as EN1398 (European Standard) specifies the safety requirements for design, construction, installation, maintenance and testing of <b>dock</b> levelers and for safety components on <b>dock</b> levelers. NOTE: edge of <b>dock</b> levelers have fixed positions which have restricted ranges making them unsuitable for nonstandard <b>dock</b> heights.|$|R
