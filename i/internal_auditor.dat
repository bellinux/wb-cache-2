40|$|The role of {{internal}} audit has changed {{during the past}} few years. Today, <b>internal</b> <b>auditors</b> are central players in organizations’ corporate governance structure. However, previous studies show that there is a gap between internal auditors’ own perception of their role compared to their stakeholders’. The wide scope {{of internal}} auditors’ role risks placing <b>internal</b> <b>auditors</b> in a situation of conflict, where consulting services threaten their provision of assurance services. In order to provide clarification to the role, this thesis studies how <b>internal</b> <b>auditors</b> become comfortable in their role, as both assurance and consulting providers and what concerns <b>internal</b> <b>auditors</b> face in their work. In order to fulfill the aim following research question is asked: How do <b>internal</b> <b>auditors</b> become comfortable in their role within risk management? Ten <b>internal</b> <b>auditors</b> were interviewed {{in order to make a}} contribution in the field of internal audit. The findings suggest that both assurance and consulting services are needed in order for <b>internal</b> <b>auditors</b> to feel they add value to the organization and hence, become comfortable in their role.

Previous studies (which do not include a South African perspective) suggest that internal auditors’ involvement in these roles tend to differ between countries and could change over time. Additionally, while a key role for <b>internal</b> <b>auditors</b> is to identify and evaluate risks within an organisation, little guidance is provided as to how <b>internal</b> <b>auditors</b> should achieve this.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the impact of {{technological}} change on the internal audit practices and skills requirements for <b>internal</b> <b>auditors</b> in an e-business environment. Design/methodology/approach – Generalist <b>internal</b> <b>auditors</b> and specialist information technology (IT) <b>internal</b> <b>auditors</b> were surveyed online in ten countries, including the USA and the UK which, together, provided the majority of responses. Findings – The results suggest a need for advanced IT-audit techniques in conducting the internal audit function, thereby increasing IT audit skill demands on generalist <b>internal</b> <b>auditors.</b> However, the results show a low confidence among <b>internal</b> <b>auditors</b> about their IT training and a continuing reliance upon IT audit specialists, rather than their own training/retraining. Research limitations/implications – The responses obtained in this study provide insight into both the status quo of the internal audit function, and to the changes that are needed to prepare generalist <b>internal</b> <b>auditors</b> for work in an e-business environment and, while the scale of the study limits the extent to which the findings may be generalized, they are consistent with the literature concerning the changing business environment and with the literature on resistance to change, suggesting that the issues revealed should be of concern. Practical implications – The results reported in this paper are useful to internal auditing educators and regulators in their consideration of the skills needed by generalist <b>internal</b> <b>auditors</b> in e-business environment. Originality/value – This study sheds light on a significantly growing area which remains relatively unexplored in the auditing-related literature, e-business audit.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} is {{to examine the effects of}} internal audit reporting lines on fraud risk assessments made by <b>internal</b> <b>auditors</b> when the level of fraud risk varies. Significant emphasis has been placed on the importance of reporting lines in maintaining the autonomy of <b>internal</b> <b>auditors,</b> but the perceived benefits of requiring internal audit to report directly to the audit committee have not been validated or systematically investigated. Results of an experiment involving 172 experienced <b>internal</b> <b>auditors</b> and additional survey findings indicate that <b>internal</b> <b>auditors</b> perceive more personal threats when they report high levels of risk directly to the audit committee, relative to management. Perceived threats lead <b>internal</b> <b>auditors</b> to reduce assessed levels of fraud risk when reporting to the audit committee relative to when reporting to management. This finding runs counter to the anticipated benefits of requirements that the internal audit function report directly to the audit committee, and it reveals potential conflicts of interest and independence threats created by the audit committee itself. We also investigate the effects of fraud risk decomposition on risk assessments made by <b>internal</b> <b>auditors.</b> We find that fraud risk assessment decomposition does not have the same effects on <b>internal</b> <b>auditors</b> as it has on external auditors, and the effects of decomposition do not align with the expected benefits of decomposition. ...|$|R
