For concreteness, we use the average hop distance as the metric of optimality. WDM networks supporting multicast communication typically employ multicast-capable switches which permit a path <b>entering</b> a <b>switch</b> on an incoming wavelength to be replicated or “split ” optically {{to one or more}} output links. This splitting incurs a power loss which is frequently neglected in existing heuristics and algorithms.

40|$|Abstract:- Hybrid {{electro-optical}} {{packet switches}} utilize optics in the backplane to switch optical packets from inputs to outputs on electronic line cards. The optical packets are traditionally considerably larger than minimum size IP packets. IP packets <b>entering</b> the <b>switch</b> must be formatted (segmented) and encapsulated in the optical packet format. This process is called packetisation or aggregation. This paper investigates a novel technique for aggregating IP packets into optical packets. It combines the well known i-OCF switch scheduler with the aggregation process. When a segment arrives at an empty optical packet, the optical packet is time stamped. This time stamp is then {{used in the}} i-OCF scheduler to compute a maximal weight match for the hybrid electro-optical packet switch matrix. In this paper it is illustrated that the optimum number of iterations, used for this particular application, is higher than Log(N) which is used for maximal size matching schedulers as i-SLIP. Furthermore, it is investigated how large a speedup is {{required in order to}} provide 100 % throughput. Key-Words:- i-OCF, MWM Scheduler, Optical Packet Switching (OPS), Packet Aggregation...|$|R

40|$|Optical {{switching}} {{has been}} considered as a natural choice {{to keep pace with}} growing fiber link capacity. One key research issue of all-optical switching is the design of optical queues by using optical crossbar switches and fiber delay lines (SDL). In this paper, we focus on the construction of an optical priority queue with a single (M+ 2) × (M+ 2) crossbar switch and M fiber delay lines, and evaluate it in terms of the buffer size of the priority queue. Currently, the best known upper bound of the buffer size is O(2 ^M), while existing methods can only construct a priority queue with buffer O(M^ 3). In this paper, we make a great step towards closing the above huge gap. We propose a very efficient construction of priority queues with buffer 2 ^Θ(√(M)). We use 4 -to- 1 multiplexers with different buffer sizes, which can be constructed efficiently with SDL, as intermediate building blocks to simplify the design. The key idea in our construction is to route each packet <b>entering</b> the <b>switch</b> to some group of four 4 -to- 1 multiplexers according to its current priority, which is shown to be collision-free.

50|$|In a {{very simple}} example, a switch with three ports A, B, and C has a normal node {{connected}} to port A while ports B and C are connected {{to each other in}} a loop. All ports have the same link speed and run in full duplex mode. Now, when a broadcast frame <b>enters</b> the <b>switch</b> through port A, this frame is forwarded to all ports but the source port, i.e. ports B and C. Both frames exiting ports B and C traverse the loop in opposite directions and reenter the switch through their counterpart port. The frame received on port B is then forwarded to ports A and C, the frame received on port C to ports A and B. So, the node on port A receives two copies of its own broadcast frame while the other two copies produced by the loop continue to cycle. Likewise, each broadcast frame entering the system continues to cycle through the loop in both directions, rebroadcasting back to the network in each loop, and broadcasts accumulate. Eventually, the accumulated broadcasts exhaust the egress capacity of the links, the switch begins dropping frames, and communication across the switch becomes unreliable or even impossible.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In all-optical packet switching, packets may {{arrive at}} an optical switch in an uncoordinated fashion. When {{contention}} occurs, fiber delay lines (FDLs) are needed to delay (buffer) the packets that have lost in the contention to some future timeslots for the desired output ports. There have been several optical-buffered switch architectures and FDL assignment algorithms proposed in the literature. However, most of them either have high implementation complexity or fail to schedule in advance departure time for the delayed packets. In this paper, we study the packet scheduling algorithms for the single-stage shared-FDL optical packet switch. We propose three new FDL assignment algorithms, namely sequential FDL assignment (SEFA), multi-cell FDL assignment (MUFA), and parallel iterative FDL assignment (PIFA) algorithms for the switch. Our algorithms can make FDL and output-port reservation so as to schedule departure time for packets. Owing to FDL and/or output-port conflicts, the packets that fail to be scheduled are discarded before <b>entering</b> the <b>switch</b> {{so that they do}} not occupy any FDL resources. We show by simulation that with these algorithms, the optical-buffered switch can achieve a loss rate of ~ 10 − 7 even at the load of 0. 9. These algorithms are extended to the three-stage Clos-network optical packet switches in our companion paper.

40|$|The inner ears {{of adult}} humans and other mammals possess a limited {{capacity}} for regenerating sensory hair cells, {{which can lead}} to permanent auditory and vestibular deficits. During development and regeneration, undifferentiated supporting cells within inner ear sensory epithelia can self-renew and give rise to new hair cells; however, these otic progenitors become depleted postnatally. Therefore, reprogramming differentiated supporting cells into otic progenitors is a potential strategy for restoring regenerative potential to the ear. Transient expression of the induced pluripotency transcription factors, Oct 3 / 4, Klf 4, Sox 2, and c-Myc reprograms fibroblasts into neural progenitors under neural-promoting culture conditions, so as a first step, we explored whether ectopic expression of these factors can reverse supporting cell quiescence in whole organ cultures of adult mouse utricles. Co-infection of utricles with adenoviral vectors separately encoding Oct 3 / 4, Klf 4, Sox 2, and the degradation-resistant T 58 A mutant of c-Myc (c-MycT 58 A) triggered significant levels of supporting cell S-phase entry as assessed by continuous BrdU labeling. Of the four factors, c-MycT 58 A alone was both necessary and sufficient for the proliferative response. The number of BrdU-labeled cells plateaued between 5 - 7 days after infection, and then decreased ~ 60 % by 3 weeks, as many cycling cells appeared to <b>enter</b> apoptosis. <b>Switching</b> to differentiation-promoting culture medium at 5 days after ectopic expression of c-MycT 58 A temporarily attenuated the loss of BrdU-labeled cells and accompanied a very modest but significant expansion of the sensory epithelium. A small number of the proliferating cells in these cultures labeled for the hair cell marker, myosin VIIA, suggesting they had begun differentiating towards a hair cell fate. The results indicate that ectopic expression of c-MycT 58 A in combination with methods for promoting cell survival and differentiation may restore regenerative potential to supporting cells within the adult mammalian inner ear...|$|R

We studied these effects and effects of microhabitats and risk factors (distance from refuge, temperature) on flight initiation distance (FID, distance between predator and prey when escape begins) and distance fled (DF) in the lizard Sceloporus virgatus. FID increased as distance to refuge increased and temperature decreased. DF increased as FID increased, supporting the hypothesis that individual differences in boldness are consistent among encounter phases. Refuges were rock crevices, trees, logs, and grass clumps. Interhabitat differences in FID and DF matched those in distance to refuge. FID was longer for lizards on rocks and ground than trees due to proximity to and use of refuge.
