40|$|The present thesis {{proposes a}} novel {{analysis}} for wh-questions in Cypriot Greek (henceforth CG). It examines properties of CG wh-questions {{which have not}} been addressed in the literature and investigates the asymmetries these interrogatives are assumed to display. In view of the discrepancies which {{exist in the literature}} with respect to the properties of CG wh-questions, a controlled experimental study was conducted in the framework of this research, in order to resolve these discrepancies and provide us with an insight to the grammar of CG wh-questions. On the basis of the findings of this study, I propose a mono- clausal analysis for embu wh-questions in CG. I argue that the difference between prestige norm and dialectal wh-structures lies in the overt and null realization of a C head, embu. Adopting a Split-CP analysis, I argue that embu in CG interrogatives <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>Wh</b> head. I show that this analysis accounts for the distribution of sentential adjuncts and negative markers in these interrogatives. With respect to the asymmetries between CG wh-questions, I argue that these can be formally accounted for. I propose that the obligatory occurrence of 'mbu in inda wh- arguments and sluices derives from the fact that 'mbu, unlike embu, is not a Wh head. I argue that inda and 'mbu have been reanalyzed into a wh-element, indambu. In view of the sluicing data examined in the study as well as other cross-linguistic data, I propose a novel analysis for sluicing, according to which, ellipsis derives from the Non-Transfer of strong phases to the Phonological Component.

40|$|Epithelial cells {{polarize}} through {{reorganization of}} the actin cytoskeleton which results in distinct apical and basolateral domains. At the apical domain are structures called microvilli, which are plasma membrane protrusions tethered to a bundled actin filament core. It {{has been shown that}} ERM proteins, specifically Ezrin, are important for microvilli formation in these polarized cells. Ezrin is responsible for tethering the actin core to plasma membrane proteins both directly and indirectly through the scaffolding protein EBP 50. What is unclear, however, is how the actin filament core of microvilli is nucleated and assembled. There are several classes of unbranched actin nucleators and regulators, including formins, Spire, VASp, and Cordon Bleu. Formins are involved in the nucleation and polymerization of other actin based membrane protrusions like filopodia, structures similar to microvilli. To determine a potential role for formins in microvilli formation, I used quantitative RT-PCR to quantify relative formin transcript levels in an epithelial cell line that displays abundant microvilli. The top formin candidates were then knocked down using siRNA to explore their role in microvilli formation. I saw minimal effects on microvilli and upon expression of GFP fusion proteins I found that formins were not localized to microvilli. I therefore looked at other actin regulators by examining their localization in epithelial cells. Cordon Bleu (Cobl) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>WH</b> 2 -containing protein believed to act as an actin nucleator. I show that it has a very specific localization in epithelial cells at the basal region of microvilli, a localization unlikely to be involved in actin nucleation. The protein is localized by a central region between the N-terminal COBL domain and the three C-terminal WH 2 domains. Ectopic expression of Cobl shortens apical microvilli, and this requires functional WH 2 domains. Proteomic studies reveal that the COBL domain binds several BAR-containing proteins, including SNX 9, PACSIN 2 /Syndapin- 2 and ASAP 1. ASAP 1 is recruited to the base of microvilli by binding the COBL domain through its SH 3 domain. I propose that Cobl is localized to the basal region of microvilli to participate in both length regulation and to recruit BAR proteins that associate with the curved membrane found at the microvillar base. 2020 - 01 - 2...|$|E

To the extent that the wh-paradigms justify an underlying SVO analysis of Bangla rather than SOV analysis, the paper also provides good empirical support for a Kaynean account of strongly-head-final languages...|$|R

40|$|Introduction We {{consider}} an economic {{model for a}} communication network with utility-maximizing elastic users who adapt to congestion by adjusting their flows. Users are heterogeneous with respect to both the utility they attach to different levels of flow and their sensitivity to delay or other measures of congestion. Following Kelly at al [4], we introduce dynamical rate-control algorithms, based on the users' utility functions and delay sensitivities, as well as tolls charged by the system, and examine their behavior. We show that allowing heterogeneity with respect to delay sensitivity introduces a fundamental non-convexity into the congestion-cost functions. As <b>a</b> result, there <b>are</b> typically multiple stationary points. Hence marginal-cost pricing - equating users' marginal utilities to their marginal costs - may identify a local maximum or even a saddle point, rather than a global maximum.

40|$|<b>A</b> {{white hole}} (<b>WH)</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> time-reversed black hole (BH) {{solution}} in General relativity (GR) with a spacetime region to which cannot be entered from the outside. Recently they have <b>been</b> proposed as <b>a</b> possible {{solution to the}} information loss problem [Phys. Rev. D 92, 104020 (2015) ]. In particular {{it has been argued}} that the quantization of the gravitational field may prevent a BH from collapsing entirely with an exponential decay law associated to the black-hole-to-white-hole (BHWH) tunneling scenario [Class. Quantum Grav. 34 105007 (2017) ]. During this period of BHWH transition the Hawking radiation should take place. Taking this possibility into account, we utilize the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) and Parkih-Wilczek (PW) methods to study the Hawking radiation viewed as a quantum tunneling effect to calculate the tunneling rate of vector particles tunneling inside (outside) the horizon of <b>a</b> <b>WH</b> (BH), respectively. We show that Hawking radiation associated to <b>a</b> <b>WH</b> lead to <b>a</b> negative HT (but equal to the BH temperature in absolute value) when viewed from the outside region of the WH geometry.
