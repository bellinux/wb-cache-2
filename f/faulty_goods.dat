The increasing complexity of RF integrated circuits is creating an obstacle for the correct measurement of the main RF blocks of any transceiver.

The chosen methodology is the structural test (fault-oriented). A fault coverage campaign is carried out in order to find the quantity to monitor on-chip that maximizes the probability to find all possible physical defects in the CUT. Silicon demonstrators for wafer sort purposes are implemented using the ST CMOS 130 nm and 65 nm processes.

40|$|The digital {{integrated}} circuit (IC) tester is implemented by using the ATmega 32 microcontroller. The microcontroller processes the inputs and outputs and displays the results on a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD). The basic function of the digital IC tester is to test a digital IC for correct logical functioning {{as described in the}} truth table and/or function table. The designed model can test digital ICs having 14 pins. Since it is programmable, any number of ICs can be tested.

The assignment has been an investigative work connected to an investment project, where a vertical lift module used for long goods, have been purchased for the plant. Bosch Rexroth has a make-to-order approach when they manufacture their hydraulic cylinders, in other words, the hydraulic cylinders are not made to stock for later sales. By having a make-to-stock supply chain, {{there are a lot}} of variation between the different manufactured cylinder types. To respond quickly to the customer needs, a large stock level of different goods must be kept. The manufacturing plant has for some time had some problems regarding the handling of goods with lack of storage space, <b>faulty</b> <b>goods</b> picking and unsafe lifting procedures. These problem became significantly more noticeable when a new material for piston rods got introduced at the plant. To reduce the area on which stock are kept and lower the amount of <b>faulty</b> <b>goods</b> picking, the plant invested in a vertical lift module. This thesis describes a solution proposal in which large amounts of Bosch Rexroth’s long goods are placed in the vertical lift module.

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science in Information Technology (MSIT) at Strathmore UniversityLithium-ion batteries are continually being deployed in many appliances. This is due to their high energy density and cost effectiveness. Most of these {{have been around for}} years in portable devices such as mobile phones. With the onset of smartphones, there is an ever increasing need to have batteries with superior performance. This can be viewed from the context of the need for fast charging and an ability to support a fully multitasked smartphone. Lithium-ion batteries have become the defacto battery type in many of these and similar applications due to their inherent characteristics. They have found use in not just mobile phones but also in innovative products designed to light homes as well provide for mobile phone charging in rural Africa. These products include a battery pack of Lithium-ion batteries cells charged by solar panels. There are a number of challenges facing the companies dealing with such products. There is a need to provide a superior product {{while at the same time}} ensure efficiency in the production line so as to bring down costs. All these need to be done while maintaining the elusive customer loyalty. One of the major issues faced is accelerated degradation which cannot be noticed using conventional approaches. Currently the main mode of triage for failure is visualization of graphs from data collected from the sensors attached to the batteries and observing for irregularities in the charge and discharging patterns. Existing literature talks about models used on linear data for forecasting in various fields of research. It also proposes an approach to predict battery life in batteries used on various applications such as hybrid electric vehicles. The proposed method will take advantage of predictive analytics in time series analysis to predict failure based on data from the batteries. Data from the batteries spanning 30 days was used to generate gradients of daily charging gradients. These were used as the training data with a binary class of <b>faulty</b> and <b>good.</b> We are able to train a model using the nearest neighbor algorithm to obtain over 80 % accuracy with only a sample of 200 batteries data...|$|R

40|$|Behavioural {{economics}} is shedding much-needed {{new light on}} how consumer law and policy could be re-shaped to reflect more accurately the way consumers really behave, rather than how they ought to behave {{on the basis of}} the economic model of the rational consumer. This contribution considers what insights behavioural economics might offer for how consumers respond when they encounter a post-purchase problem, such as <b>faulty</b> <b>goods,</b> inadequate services, or unfair contract terms. In particular, the focus will be on whether the design and presentation of the law itself could have an effect on how consumers react when they are faced with a problem post-purchase. The context for this is the recent experience in the United Kingdom, where aspects of consumer law have recently been consolidated into a new Consumer Rights Act 2015 (“CRA”).

40|$|Consider a {{communication}} network G in which {{a limited number of}} link and/or node faults F might occur. A routing p for the network (a fixed path between each pair of nodes) must be chosen without any knowledge of which components might become <b>faulty.</b> Choosing a <b>good</b> routing corresponds to bounding the diameter of the surviving route graph R(G,p) /F, where two nonfaulty nodes are joined by an edge if there are no faults on the route between them. We prove a number of results concerning the diameter of surviving route graphs. We show that if p is a minimal length rout- ing, then the diameter of R(G,p) /F can be on the order of the number of nodes of G, even if F consists of only a single node. However, if G is the n-dimensional cube, the diameter of R(G,p) /F< 3 for any minimal length routing p and any set of faults F with IFl<n. We also show that if F consists only of edges and does not disconnect G, then the diameter of R(G,p}/F is < 31 Fl+l, while if F consists only of nodes and does not disconnect G, then the diameter of R(G,p}/F is < the sum of the degrees of the nodes in F, where in both cases p is an arbitrary minimal length routing.

40|$|The {{objective}} of manufacturing test is {{to separate the}} faulty circuits from the good circuits {{after they have been}} manufactured. Three problems encompassed by this task will be mentioned here. First, the reduction of the power consumed during test. The behavior of the circuit during test is modified due to scan insertion and other testing techniques. Due to this, the power consumed during test can be abnormally large, up to several times the power consumed during functional mode. This can result in a good circuit to fail the test or to be damaged due to heating. Second, how to modify the design so that it is easily testable. Since not every possible digital circuit can be tested properly it is necessary to modify the design to alter its behavior during test. This modification should not alter the functional behavior of the circuit. An example of this is test point insertion, a technique aimed at reducing test time and decreasing the number of faulty circuits that pass the test. Third, the creation of a test set for a given design that will both properly accomplish the task and require the least amount of time possible to be applied. The precision in separation of <b>faulty</b> circuits from <b>good</b> circuits depends on the application for which the circuit is intended and, if possible, must be maximized. The test application time is should be as low as possible to reduce test cost. This dissertation contributes to the discipline of manufacturing test and will encompass advances in the afore mentioned areas. First, a method to reduce the power consumed during test is proposed. Second, in the design modification area, a new algorithm to compute test points is proposed. Third, in the test set creation area, a new algorithm to reduce test set application time is introduced. The three algorithms are scalable to current industrial design sizes. Experimental results for the three methods show their effectiveness...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the problems and prospects of higher education in Pakistan. Higher education plays the role of leadership in the society. The functions of the university are to develop the people physically, mentally and spiritually. It improves and promotes the economic, social, political and cultural life of the nation. All over the world universities are guiding and co-operating with the industrial and agricultural development organizations and they are developing their economics rapidly and meaningfully. In Pakistan, after more than five decades, the developmental indicators are not showing positive results. The participation rate at higher education is about three percent of age group (17 - 23) and this is 16. 2 percent as world average of this age group. The advanced countries are achieving more than 40 percent participation rate in higher education. There are problems of quality of staff, students, library and laboratory. Relevance with society needs, research facilities, financial crisis, arts students more than science students, weaknesses of examination, ineffective governance and academic results are not at par with international standards. Considering the gigantic problems of higher education in Pakistan, the researcher selected this topic for research. The main objectives of the study were: (1) determining the present profile of higher education in Pakistan; (2) examining the past efforts done for the improvement of higher education; (4) highlighting the budget provisions for higher education; and (5) exploring problems of higher education in Pakistan. Experts dealing with education in the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Science and Technology, Higher Education Commission, Provincial Departments of Education, university teachers, university administrators, planners, examination experts, university students and community leaders constituted the population of the study. Eight universities were selected randomly for the sample. Twenty university teachers and forty students from each university were included in the sample. Thirty community leaders and fifty experts were also included in the sample. Four questionnaires were developed after pilot testing for the collection of data. The data were collected by the researcher personally. He made many efforts for collection of data from the experts, leaders, teachers and students. Data were tabulated and analyzed using the Likert's five-point scale and chi-square. After drawing the conclusions, some workable recommendations were made for the improvement of relevance, quality, finances, effectiveness and access of higher education in Pakistan. Following conclusions were drawn from responses. (i) access was very limited in universities. (ii) quality was very low in the fields of academic, administration, research and equipment. (iii) faculty and staff need development in knowledge and skills. (iv) funds were provided inadequate and misappropriation was common. (v) character building of the students was ignored. (vi) there was no linkage between university and industry. (vii) examination system was <b>faulty.</b> (viii) <b>good</b> governance was non-existent. (ix) private sector was expanding without merit. Following recommendations were made on the basis of conclusions: (i) Enrolment in universities should be increased by providing adequate all types of educational facilities.
