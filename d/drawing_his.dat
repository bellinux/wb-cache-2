5|$|A {{different}} {{version of}} Troilus' death appears on a red-figure cup by Oltos. Troilus {{is on his}} knees, {{still in the process}} of <b>drawing</b> <b>his</b> sword when Achilles' spear has already stabbed him and Aeneas comes too late to save him. Troilus wears a helmet, but it is pushed up to reveal a beautiful young face. This is the only such depiction of Troilus' death in early figurative art. However, this version of Troilus as a youth defeated in battle appears also in written sources.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} {{characters}} of the series, Perry was structured in a simple style to allow young viewers to easily draw him. In keeping with the show's general design scheme, Perry is constructed of geometric shapes in a style reminiscent of deceased Looney Tunes animator Tex Avery. Povenmire uses different design styles for drawing Perry depending on how he is portrayed. When Perry is portrayed as a domesticated and mindless pet, Povenmire begins with a square shaped like a loaf of bread. He then draws his front legs and feet before <b>drawing</b> <b>his</b> bill, which is set at a certain angle. Povenmire then draws his eyeballs, which are never focused and look in opposing directions in a daze. He concludes the figure by adding his hind legs, tail, hair, and finally color.|$|E
5|$|Most gunfights {{are portrayed}} in films or books as having two men square off, waiting {{for one to}} make the first move. This was rarely the case. Often, a gunfight was spur-of-the-moment, with one <b>drawing</b> <b>his</b> pistol, and the other reacting. Often it would develop into a shootout where both men bolted for cover. In popular folklore, men who held {{noteworthy}} reputations as a gunfighter were eager to match up against another gunman with the same reputation. On the contrary, in cases where two men held a similar reputation, both would avoid confrontation with one another whenever possible. They rarely took undue risks, and usually weighed their options before confronting another well-known gunman. This respect for one another is why most famous gunfights were rarely two or more well-known gunmen matched up against one another, but rather one notable gunman against a lesser-known opponent or opponents.|$|E

50|$|Reich <b>drew</b> <b>his</b> early inspirations {{from the}} beaches of Lake Balaton, where he first began to <b>draw.</b> <b>His</b> later {{influences}} included Greek mythology. With {{a great sense of}} intuition he illustrated about 500 books.|$|R

5|$|No ancient {{biographies of}} Theramenes are known, but {{his life and}} actions are {{relatively}} well documented, due to the extensive treatment given him in several surviving works. The Attic orator Lysias deals with him at length in several of his speeches, albeit in a very hostile manner. Theramenes also appears in several ancient narrative histories: Thucydides' account includes the beginnings of Theramenes' career, and Xenophon, picking up where Thucydides left off, gives {{a detailed account of}} several episodes from Theramenes career; Diodorus Siculus, probably <b>drawing</b> <b>his</b> account from Ephorus at most points, provides another account that varies widely from Xenophon's at several points. Theramenes also appears in several other sources, which, although they do not provide as many narrative details, have been used to illuminate the political disputes which surrounded Theramenes' life and memory.|$|E
5|$|Some time later, John Bell Hatcher {{is backing}} out of paying his share of a card game by <b>drawing</b> <b>his</b> revolver. He has taken to gambling, as Marsh, who employs him as a bone hunter, is not {{providing}} him with enough funds. Marsh lobbies the Bureau of Indian Affairs on behalf of Red Cloud, but also visits with the Geological Survey, insinuating {{that he would be}} a better leader of the USGS than Cope. After learning about Sam Smith's attempted sabotage of Cope and once again receiving no payment from Marsh, Hatcher leaves his employ. Marsh, now representing the survey, heads west with wealthy businessmen, scoffing at the financial misfortunes of Cope, whose investments have failed.|$|E
5|$|The Great Silence was one {{of several}} Spaghetti Westerns {{produced}} between 1967 and 1968, along with Enzo G. Castellari's Kill Them All and Come Back Alone and One Dollar Too Many, Sergio Sollima's Run, Man, Run and Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West, to be showcased in Patrick Morin's made-for-television documentary Western, Italian Style. During the making of the film, Corbucci and Trintignant were interviewed; Corbucci discussed the nature of violence in his films and Spaghetti Westerns in general (comparing the use of violence in such films to the James Bond franchise), while Trintignant spoke of the unusual nature of his role and how he would practice <b>drawing</b> <b>his</b> gun – by pulling a sock (substituting for the gloves Silence wears in the film) off his hand and reaching for a long-steamed artichoke in his pocket.|$|E

5|$|There {{were four}} {{probable}} {{reasons for the}} deviation in the division's direction: first, regiments from the III Corps were unexpectedly in the Devil's Den area and they would threaten Hood's right flank {{if they were not}} dealt with; second, fire from the 2nd U.S. Sharpshooters at Slyder's farm drew the attention of lead elements of Law's Brigade, moving in pursuit and <b>drawing</b> <b>his</b> brigade to the right; third, the terrain was rough and units naturally lost their parade-ground alignments; finally, Hood's senior subordinate, Gen. Law, was unaware that he was now in command of the division, so he could not exercise control.|$|E
25|$|A fellow {{taxi driver}} refers Travis to illegal gun dealer, Easy Andy, from whom Travis buys {{a number of}} handguns. At home, Travis {{practices}} <b>drawing</b> <b>his</b> weapons and constructs a sleeve gun to hide and then quickly deploy a gun from his sleeve.|$|E
25|$|During the 1970s, Carbó drew Plácido Guerra. After getting {{weary of}} work at Editorial Bruguera, {{he left for}} Diario de Valencia daily where he {{continued}} <b>drawing</b> <b>his</b> Placido Guerra for its in-house supplement. Carbó also drew for the falles journal, El Coet, and adult magazine, Reseo (Cattle Magazine).|$|E
60|$|Pambe beat {{it into a}} basin over Nurkeed's woolly head. Nurkeed <b>drew</b> <b>HIS</b> sheath-knife {{and stabbed}} Pambe in the leg. Pambe <b>drew</b> <b>his</b> sheath-knife; but Nurkeed dropped down into the {{darkness}} of the hold and spat through the grating at Pambe, who was staining the clean fore-deck with his blood.|$|R

25|$|As Jairzinho accelerated, {{the ever}} {{dangerous}} striker Tostão began a sprint up the middle, <b>drawing</b> <b>his</b> defender with him, diverting the Italian defence and making {{more room for}} Jairzinho. Younger players should note the movement off the ball by Brazil. Increasingly squeezed inside, Jairzinho's run nevertheless drew the defence {{to him and he}} eased the ball to Pelé in the centre. Always dangerous, Pelé paused and shaped to make a dribble.|$|E
25|$|After {{a year at}} the Brest Military Academy, he {{returned}} to Paris where he shared a studio with his friend Aman-Jean, while also renting a small apartment at 16 rue de Chabrol. For the next two years, he worked at mastering the art of monochrome <b>drawing.</b> <b>His</b> first exhibited work, shown at the Salon, of 1883, was a Conté crayon drawing of Aman-Jean. He also studied the works of Eugène Delacroix carefully, making notes on his use of color.|$|E

25|$|Scorsese {{and writer}} Paul Schrader append the perfect {{conclusion}} to Taxi Driver. Steeped in irony, the five-minute epilogue underscores {{the vagaries of}} fate. The media builds Bickle into a hero, when, had he been a little quicker <b>drawing</b> <b>his</b> gun against Senator Palantine, {{he would have been}} reviled as an assassin. As the film closes, the misanthrope has been embraced as the model citizen—someone who takes on pimps, drug dealers, and mobsters to save one little girl.|$|E
25|$|When Ohno was in {{the third}} grade, he was {{inspired}} by his classmate's Dragon Ball illustration to start drawing. Since then, he has been <b>drawing</b> <b>his</b> own artwork and making original figurines. In 2008, he held an art exhibition called Freestyle, making him the first artist in Johnny's to hold one. In 2015, {{it was announced that}} Ohno will be holding a second art exhibition called Freestyle II in Tokyo from July 24 to August 23. In addition, Ohno will be holding an art exhibition the same year in Shanghai from July 9 to July 29, showcasing artwork from his first art exhibition, Freestyle.|$|E
25|$|Bryant drove {{three hundred}} metres down the road, to {{where a woman}} and her two {{children}} were walking. He stopped and fired two shots, killing the woman and the child she was carrying. The older child fled, but Bryant followed her and killed her with a single shot. He then stole a gold-coloured BMW by killing all four of its occupants. A short distance down the road he stopped beside a couple in a white Toyota and, <b>drawing</b> <b>his</b> weapon, ordered the male occupant into the boot of the BMW. After shutting the boot, he fired two shots into the windscreen of the Toyota, killing the female driver.|$|E

25|$|Merle, however, {{continuing}} his march along its original axis, was now <b>drawing</b> <b>his</b> division upon the right {{flank of the}} second Spanish line; sensing this opportunity, Bessières ordered Merle to wheel right and plunge into the Spanish flank à la baïonnette. Mouton's chasseurs appeared on the Spanish left, and under the combined pressure the Spanish line, overlapped and plunged into disorder, ruptured. The leading Spanish grenadier battalions struck their last determined blows against the French centre before being caught in this crossfire and brusquely forced off the ridge, convincing Cuesta to sound the retreat. As with Blake's retreat, a rearguard of regular battalions held off the French while the other formations flew north to Medina.|$|E
25|$|The Overland Campaign {{began as}} Grant's forces crossed the Rapidan River on May 4, 1864. Grant's {{objective}} was to force an engagement with Lee, outside of his Mine Run fortifications, by either <b>drawing</b> <b>his</b> forces out or turning them. Lee, displaying the audacity that characterized his generalship, moved out as Grant desired, but more quickly than Grant anticipated; Union forces had insufficient time to clear the area known as the Wilderness, a tangle of scrub brush and undergrowth in which part of the Battle of Chancellorsville had been fought the previous year. By forcing a fight here, Lee effectively neutralized the Union's advantage in artillery. He ordered Ewell's Corps to advance on the Orange Turnpike, A.P. Hill's in parallel on the Orange Plank Road, and Longstreet's from the distant Gordonsville.|$|E
25|$|The cap also {{includes}} a provision to close a potential loophole that would provide incentives for teams to skirt the cap by signing an older player to a long-term deal that would not end until after the team expects the player to retire. Cap analyst Larry Coon outlined how this potential loophole would work:For example, suppose the Non-Taxpayer Mid-Level exception is $9 million. With 5% raises, a three-year contract would total $28.35 million. But if they added a fourth year to the contract, the salary would total $38.7 million. If the player retires after three seasons and continues <b>drawing</b> <b>his</b> salary for the additional season, then he effectively will be paid $38.7 million for three years' work. In essence, they are giving the player a three-year contract with additional deferred compensation.|$|E
