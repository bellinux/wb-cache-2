MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred seventy-four consecutive biopsy-proven G 1 CHC patients were evaluated by anthropometric and metabolic measurements. One hundred seventy-four patients attending an outpatient cardiology unit were used as controls. Intima-media thickness (IMT) and carotid plaques, defined as focal thickening of > 1. 3 mm at the level of common carotid, were evaluated using ultrasonography.

40|$|Background: Transient {{bone marrow}} suppression, {{characterized}} by acute {{inability of the}} bone marrow toproduce circulating blood cells, may strongly relate to the pathogenesis of some viral infections. Objective: To study the prevalence of some DNA and RNA viruses in patients with transient bone marrowsuppression. Methods: EDTA-treated blood samples were collected from 27 patients with clinically- and laboratoryconfirmedtransient bone marrow suppression. The genomic DNA of hepatitis B virus, adenovirus, polyomavirusBK, and parvovirus B 19, and genomic RNA of <b>hepatitis</b> C and <b>G</b> viruses were extracted andamplified by sensitive and specific in-house simple and nested PCR and RT-PCR protocols, respectively. The risk factors that {{might be related to}} the studied viral infections were analyzed. Results: Hepatitis B virus infection was diagnosed in 9 (33 %) of 27 patients; adenovirus infection in 2 (7 %); and parvovirus B 19 infection in 7 (26 %) of 27 patients. The genomic DNA of polyomovirus BK wasnot detected in any patients. Both <b>hepatitis</b> C and <b>G</b> viruses were found in 3 (11 %) of 27 patients. Conclusion: Diagnosis of the high prevalence of hepatitis B virus, and parvovirus B 19 in patients with transientbone marrow suppression, reflects the importance of these viral infections in introducing bonemarrow suppression.

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: The {{pathogenic}} role of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>G</b> virus, {{the recently}} discovered blood-borne agent, is controversial.

METHODS: We studied 166 Italian patients (112 male, 54 female, mean age 61. 8 +/- 9. 3, mean+/-SD, range 34 - 85). One hundred and eighteen had cirrhosis, which was complicated by hepatocellular carcinoma in 66 cases. Forty-eight patients had extra-hepatic malignancies.

Specific amino acid substitutions in the regions from amino acids 117 to 121 and amino acids 144 to 147 located in the major hydrophilic region of the S gene were associated with carriers with OBIs (P < 0. 001 for carriers with OBIs versus HBsAg(+) donors, carriers with OBIs versus HBsAg(+) asymptomatic carriers with OBIs versus HBsAg(+) chronic <b>hepatitis</b> patients). <b>G</b> 145 R was the major variation in the HBV isolates responsible for local occult HBV infections.

40|$|Background : Recently, a novel {{blood-borne}} virus {{has been identified}} and named <b>hepatitis</b> <b>G</b> virus. Transfusion is the main route of transmission. It is known that patients on maintenance dialysis {{are more susceptible to}} infections with parenterally-transmitted viruses than the general population. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the prevalence of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>G</b> infection in a Belgian dialysis unit. Methods: The entire population of our dialysis unit (82 patients) was tested for the presence of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>G</b> virus (HGV) by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. History of transfusion or renal transplantation coinfections with hepatitis B and C viruses, and serum aminotransferase levels were also tested. Results: Thirteen patients (16 %) were found positive for HGV-RNA. Among these patients, 69. 2 % were infected by the G virus alone, 15. 4 % were coinfected with B virus, and 15. 4 % with C virus. All but one patient had a history of transfusion. Ten of the thirteen infected patients (77 %) had normal aminotransferase (< 30 UI/l). Three patients had elevated aminotransferase levels (23 %); one was coinfected with B virus, one with C virus, and the last one had a diabetes-induced fatty liver infiltration. No liver biopsies were performed. Conclusions :It is concluded that infection with C virus is common among dialyzed patients. This high rate of infection could be related to previous transfusions, but may as well be due to nosocomial transmission. In our series, at least one patient has been contaminated by another road than transplantation or transfusion. Finally, it does not appear clearly that chronic infection with <b>hepatitis</b> <b>G</b> virus induces Liver disease, as defined by elevated aminotransferase level. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Objectives, The aim of {{this study}} was to define the {{features}} of chronic cryptogenic hepatitis (CCH) in childhood and to investigate whether it is related to <b>hepatitis</b> <b>G</b> virus infection. Methods, Forty-six children (24 males; age range, 1. 5 to 17 years) with CCH were studied, CCH was diagnosed when serum alanine aminotransferase concentrations were more than 1. 5 times normal for longer than 6 months without any apparent cause of liver disease. Results, No patient had acute symptomatic onset or had received a blood transfusion, Three had undergone minor surgical procedures, All appeared to be healthy during follow-up (median, 4. 2 years; range, 1 to 10 years). Hypertransaminasemia was the only aberrant liver function test, Elevated serum alanine aminotransferase values alternated with normal values in 40 children (86. 9 %). Five children (10. 8 %) had a spontaneous sustained (> 12 months) remission of hypertransaminasemia. Twelve (26 %) had laboratory signs of autoimmunity, but none fulfilled the criteria for autoimmune hepatitis. Of 20 children who underwent liver biopsy, 13 (65 %) had minimal chronic hepatitis, 4 (20 %) had mild chronic hepatitis and 3 (15 %) had moderate chronic hepatitis, Serum <b>hepatitis</b> <b>G</b> virus RNA was detected in 2 girls (4 %) whose risk factor was a <b>hepatitis</b> <b>G</b> virus-infected mother and a minor surgical procedure, respectively. In 12 families at least 1 other member had chronic liver disease, Conclusions. Childhood CCH seems to be a symptomless disease characterized by isolated hypertransaminasemia with onset during the first 4 years of life and mild to moderate histologic liver lesions.
