They may encounter corvids at carrion sites and the large passerines are often highly cautious, either feeding {{some distance from the}} eagle or waiting until the eagle is done eating, lest they be predaceously grabbed. Occasionally, however, corvids may behave more boldly around golden eagles. In one case, a group of three black-billed magpies were observed to rob a golden eagle of its prey. Golden eagles also usually dominate both New World and Old World vultures. Smaller species like black vulture (Coragyps atratus) in North America and Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus) in Eurasia are known to be occasionally hunted by golden eagles. Besides the Steller's sea eagle, the larger species of Old World vulture and the California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) are the only noticeably larger raptorial birds that a golden eagle may encounter. The relationship between these large vultures and golden eagles can be highly contentious, with most sources favoring victory for the eagle due to its more aggressive disposition, much stronger feet and sharp talons. In one case, a colony of griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) was exceptionally able to displace a pair golden eagles from a cliff where they were trying nest so they could nest there themselves. On the other hand, a 5-year-old griffon vulture reintroduced into the wild in Bulgaria was thought to have been killed by a golden eagle. The golden eagle is a potential predator of the lammergeier which is often attracted to much the same habitat and prey as the eagle but often feeds largely on bone marrow from carcasses. It has been observed that both golden eagles and lammergeiers will readily pirate food away from each other. In the Southwestern United States, several conflicts between huge California condors and golden eagles have been observed. At carrion, victory during conflicts can go either way apparently. Recent observation have suggested that the critically endangered condors do not seem to actively defend their nesting territories from golden eagles but have been recorded gaining <b>incidental</b> <b>protection</b> from prairie falcons and common ravens, which both aggressively displaced the eagles from their own adjacent territories. The golden eagle is considered an occasional predator of California condors (especially fledglings) but there seems to be {{little in the way of}} eyewitness accounts to confirm this. It is possible that (as in the Bulgarian griffon vultures) the California condors have lost their natural cautiousness around eagles due to having been reintroduced from captivity.|$|E

They are normally dominant over other raptors although may (sometimes fatally) lose in conflicts to large raptors such as other Bubo owls, golden eagles {{and the smaller}} but much faster peregrine falcons. Some species nesting near snowy owl nests, such as the snow goose, seem {{to benefit from the}} <b>incidental</b> <b>protection</b> of snowy owls that drive competing predators out of the area.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{focus on the}} {{institutional}} implications of the EU Unfair Terms Directive (93 / 13) in Poland in the broader context {{of the welfare state}} model prevalent in that post-socialist EU Member State. I depart from the assumption that there is, in principle, a link between the intensity of the welfare state and the level of consumer protection, as evidenced e. g. by the traditionally high level of both in the Nordic countries. Such a view is supported by the fact that both policies are the expression of the desire to promote social justice. Hence, I argue that there is a close link between the currently experienced atrophy of the welfare state in capitalist Poland and stances towards consumer protection. Therefore, in section 2, I depart from a brief account of the evolution of the Polish welfare state from the pre- 1989 state-socialist model to the current model within the framework of Poland's new capitalism, which can be described on a theoretical plane as marginal or residual, if not simply atrophic. In section 3, I discuss the evolution of consumer protection in Poland, indicating its initial lack during the state-socialist period and its emergence in the early 1980 s, before moving on to the post-socialist period and the impact of European integration. Having presented the background information on the welfare state and consumer protection, in section 4 I discuss in detail the institutional impact of the Unfair Terms Directive. My analysis encompasses such aspects as the definition of a consumer, the substantive scope of protection and the available means of <b>protection</b> (<b>incidental</b> and abstract control). I will also discuss the newly introduced group actions (comparable to class actions) which are specifically tailored for consumer cases, including those where the rules on unfair terms are involved. In section 5, I present my concluding remarks...|$|R
50|$|Both {{heavy rain}} and {{excessive}} heat can potentially kill nestlings, so golden eagles often place their nests {{to suit the}} local climate. In northern areas, such as Alaska, sun exposure (southern orientation) may help nesting success, while those nesting in hot, lowland Utah and arid regions of Israel were mainly northerly facing to keep the nest out of the hot glare of the sun. Almost all established breeding golden eagles build more than one nest. A typical range of nests per pair is between 2 and 5. In Sweden, pairs on average built 2.4 of them. There is {{an average of about}} 4.5 nests per pair in Scotland. In Idaho, there was an average of 6 nests per pair. In more exceptional cases, up to 13 nests have built by a single pair in Scotland and up to 12 by a single pair in Idaho. Some pairs utilize alternate nest sites every year, others apparently rarely use alternate nests. Some golden eagle pairs may not use a nest for up to six years after its construction. Golden eagle nests usually consist of heavy tree branches, upholstered with grass when in use. As is typical of a large accipitrid, the nests of golden eagles are very large. However, they are smaller on average than bald eagle nests. In Kazakhstan, golden eagle nests were similar in size to white-tailed eagle nests. In the Isle of Mull in Scotland, however, white-tailed eagle nests were slightly larger as they used thicker, larger sticks lined with grass that make a more massive nest than the isle's golden eagle nests, which used thinner sticks or heather and lined their nest with woodrush. In Arizona, golden eagle nests averaged 175.7 cm in length (ranging from 121.9 to 264.2 cm), 119.8 cm in width (range of 83.8 - 203.2 cm), and 65.0 cm in height (range of 12.7 - 200.7 cm). The sticks used in the Arizona nests ranged up to a length of 185.4 cm, a diameter of 5.3 cm and a weight of 980 g. Nests in Scotland average 133 cm in length, 106 cm in width and 79 cm in depth. In Washington state, tree nests averaged 90 cm in depth and 1.2 to 1.5 m in diameter. Nests in Sweden averaged 140 cm in length, 140 cm in width and 110 cm in depth. Nests in Kazakhstan averaged 148.3 cm in length, 115.7 cm in diameter and 48 cm in depth. The nest of the golden eagle may weigh well over 250 kg. As the eagles use a nest repeatedly, they repair their nests whenever necessary and enlarge them during each use. If the eyrie is situated on a tree, supporting tree branches may break because of the weight of the nest. The largest known golden eagle nest, located on a steep river butte along Sun River in Montana, was 6.1 m deep and 2.59 m in width. Certain other animals—too small to be of interest to the huge raptor—sometimes use the nest as shelter or even as a nest for themselves, for the <b>incidental</b> <b>protection</b> offered. This has mainly been associated with Eurasian wren (Troglodytes troglodytes) in Europe, though has also been recorded remarkably with ring ouzels (Turdus torquatus) and pine martens, both of which have been recorded as prey for golden eagles elsewhere in Europe. In a similar situation, little curlews in northeastern Siberia apparently gain some protection from predators by nesting close to golden eagle eyries. In each case, the natural predators of these animals are just the right size for golden eagle prey, and therefore avoid active eyries. Related species such as eastern imperial and Bonelli’s eagles have been observed to nest in abandoned golden eagle nests, as well as distantly related or unrelated raptors including white-tailed eagles, lammergeiers, gyrfalcons and peregrine falcons.|$|E
40|$|Historians {{refer to}} the Morrill Tariff as the first {{statement}} of the nascent Republican party’s protectionist agenda, yet {{an analysis of the}} measure reveals that this enduring icon of historiography needs modification. Implemented as a direct response to the fiscal crisis created by the Buchanan administration, the Morrill Tariff represents a bipartisan effort to augment federal revenue for a depleted Treasury. Both President James Buchanan and many of his Democratic colleagues in Congress urged revising the Tariff of 1857 to arrest the growth of the federal deficit. However, the bitter rhetoric that accompanied the secession crisis has obscured the true nature of this short-lived, but important, revenue measure. An examination of the Morrill Tariff and the circumstances surrounding its passage demonstrate that it re-established the rates from the free trade Tariff of 1846 while providing <b>incidental</b> <b>protection</b> for select industries, a practice accepted, even advocated, by the Democratic party for over a decade...|$|E
40|$|Freshwater {{ecosystems}} and their associated biota {{are among the}} most endangered in the world. Key disturbances, such as water extraction, dams, and modifications to riparian and in-stream habitats, invasive species, and impacts on water quality have heavily altered these ecosystems. Escalating human pressure on, and disturbances to, water resources requires well-informed decision making and effective on-ground management to conserve and restore freshwater ecosystems. Systematic conservation planning offers the tools needed to address these issues, providing a strategic and scientifically defensible framework. Systematic conservation planning was pioneered in the terrestrial realm and has, with time, become the most commonly recommended approach to marine planning and management because it can ensure the selection of multiple protected areas that together achieve explicit objectives. However, in comparison to the terrestrial and marine realms, the adoption of systematic methods to inform decision making for the protection and/or restoration of freshwater ecosystems remains in its infancy. The principal focus of this thesis is on spatial conservation prioritisation applied to both protected area and off-reserve management decision making. It focuses on two areas in the field of freshwater systematic conservation planning that have been identified as research priorities: 1) assessing the sensitivity of conservation planning outcomes to different surrogates and objectives; and 2) enhancing applicability of systematic conservation planning to inform on-ground management decisions. The aim of this thesis is to advance the scientific basis and application of systematic conservation planning for fresh waters. I address key questions in the field of systematic conservation planning in freshwater ecosystems, which are both novel contributions to the field and influential in informing conservation decisions both on and off-reserves, using the Wet Tropics of Queensland bioregion as a case study. My objectives were to 1) determine the occurrence of disturbances, and the <b>incidental</b> <b>protection</b> of fresh waters in terrestrial protected areas; 2) identify the effectiveness of using coarse-filter surrogates for representing freshwater fish diversity in systematic conservation planning; 3) develop methods {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} invasive species management; and 4) integrate management costs into systematic conservation planning for invasive species. There is a need for assessments that quantify the effectiveness of terrestrial protected areas for representing freshwater {{ecosystems and}} their dependent species, and that determine areas of vulnerability from human-induced disturbances. In Chapter 3, I used data on the spatial distribution of freshwater ecosystems and fish, human-induced disturbances, and the Wet Tropics protected area network to assess how well freshwater ecosystems and fish species are protected within this network. I identified human-induced disturbances likely to influence the effectiveness of freshwater protection measures and I evaluated the vulnerability of these ecosystems to human-induced disturbances within and outside protected areas. The representation of freshwater ecosystems and species in the protected areas of the Wet Tropics is poor: 83...|$|E
