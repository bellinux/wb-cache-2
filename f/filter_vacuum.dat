40|$|AbstractThe {{efficiency}} (dust {{collection and}} recirculation) {{of a conventional}} upright vacuum cleaner with a prototype vacuum bag (I) with pore size of 0 · 1 μm was compared with a standard vacuum cleaner bag (II), {{in the homes of}} 11 atopic asthmatic subjects with a known allergy to house dust mite. Four <b>filter</b> <b>vacuum</b> cleaners were assessed in pairs — the Vax 2000 with the Vorwerk VK 121 ET 340 (in 10 homes), and the Nilfisk GS 90 ‘Allergy Vac’ with the Bosch maxima 43 (in nine homes). All of the selected homes were vacuumed throughout (carpets and soft furnishings) for a 15 min period with each of the cleaners, and air was sampled simultaneously at 21 min− 1 (Casella personal sampler). The weight of dust retrieved was recorded, and a sample of sieved dust (2 g) and the air filters were extracted to determine the concentrations of the major allergen, Der pI, by ELISA (ALK). No significant difference was observed in either total weight of dust, or airborne and dust concentrations of Der pI between using the conventional cleaner with vacuum bags I, or vacuum bags II. The Vax and the Vorwerk <b>filter</b> <b>vacuum</b> cleaners produced no measurable airborne Der pI concentrations during use in any of the 10 homes tested, whilst the Nilfisk produced airborne Der pI in two, and the Bosch in one of the nine homes tested. The Vorwerk retrieved significantly more dust from the floors than the Vax (P< 0 · 002). There {{was no significant difference in}} dust retrieval between the Nilfisk and the Bosch. All of the <b>filter</b> <b>vacuum</b> cleaners investigated produced lower concentrations of airborne Der pI, compared to the conventional cleaner with or without a special dust bag. However, the amount of dust and concentration/amount of Der pI that these cleaners actually retrieved, varied and the Vorwerk appeared most effective overall...|$|E

40|$|The Health Hazard Evaluation Program {{received}} {{a request from}} a government program that provides technical assistance to drycleaning shops. The program manager was concerned about occupational exposures to two new drycleaning solvents: SolvonK 4 and DF- 2000. In May 2013, we visited one drycleaning shop that used SolvonK 4 and two that used DF- 2000. SolvonK 4 contains primarily butylal and small amounts of n-butanol and formaldehyde. DF- 2000 {{is a mixture of}} C 11 to C 15 aliphatic-branched hydrocarbons. We observed work practices, collected air samples for drycleaning solvents and other chemicals produced or used during drycleaning, and evaluated potential skin exposures to these chemicals. Our evaluations measured the highest air concentrations of drycleaning solvents during loading and unloading of the drycleaning machines and when pressing fabrics. In the SolvonK 4 shop, we documented inhalation and dermal exposures to butylal (no OELs exist and the long-term human health effects of SolvonK 4 are unknown), and found low concentrations of formaldehyde and butanol. It is unknown if the formaldehyde originated from the drycleaning solvent or from other sources such as furnishings and clothing. We observed that employees without personal protective equipment mixed SolvonK 4 with a pretreatment product and sprayed the mixture onto fabrics. In the DF- 2000 shops, we measured airborne concentrations of DF- 2000 that were well below OELs for petroleum naphthas. We saw employees without adequate personal protective equipment cleaning the stills in the SolvonK 4 and DF- 2000 drycleaning machines. We recommended the drycleaning shops (1) brush pretreatments onto fabrics instead of spraying, (2) regularly inspect and maintain the drycleaning machine according to the manufacturers' recommendations, (3) provide eye protection and chemical resistant gloves to employees, and (4) clean the shop regularly with a high efficiency particulate air <b>filter</b> <b>vacuum</b> cleaner or wet methods. We recommended the employees wear appropriate personal protective equipment, wash their hands or exposed skin with soap and water after contact with chemicals, and wash their hands after removing gloves.

All the copper films have a polycrystalline structure and preferably oriented to (111). When the substrate bias is applied, the (111) orientation of Cu film is further enhanced.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} properties and structure evolution of CoxC 1 -x (x= 44, 65, 71 at. %) nanocomposite films prepared by pulsed <b>filtered</b> <b>vacuum</b> arc deposition were studied. The as-deposited films consist of amorphous Co clusters in a-C and are soft ferromagnets. The low coercivity in the amorphous films {{is due to}} the very low anisotropy of the amorphous Co clusters. After annealing in vacuum at 350 degrees C for 1 h, the Co clusters crystallize and these films become magnetically harder. The magnetic hardening is attributed to the enhanced magnetic anisotropy of the nanocrystals. Their saturation magnetization reduces slightly. This is attributed to the reduction of the density of states at the Fermi level caused by the crystallization of the amorphous Co clusters. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics.
