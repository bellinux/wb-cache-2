5|$|The {{symptoms}} of pneumothorax can be vague and inconclusive, especially {{in those with}} a small PSP; confirmation with medical imaging is usually required. In contrast, tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency and may be treated before imaging – <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is severe hypoxia, very low blood pressure, or an impaired level of consciousness. In tension pneumothorax, X-rays are sometimes required if there is doubt about the anatomical location of the pneumothorax.|$|E

Ash fall is unlikely to kill mature trees, but ash loading may break large branches during heavy ash falls (>500 mm). Defoliation of trees may also occur, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is a coarse ash component within the ash fall.|$|E

(As of 2014, TV UNAM is now required carriage for all cable systems in Mexico alongside several other public and cultural stations.) With {{the help of the}} government-owned OPMA public television network (now Sistema Público de Radiodifusión del Estado Mexicano (SPR)), it expanded its coverage as an over-the-air digital subchannel.

25|$|The most {{apparent}} distinguishing factor between alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) {{is a history}} of alcohol use or abuse.

However, in those who use alcohol, the diagnosis may just as likely be alcoholic or nonalcoholic hepatitis <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is concurrent obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. In this case, alcoholic and nonalcoholic hepatitis can be distinguished by the pattern of liver enzyme abnormalities; specifically, in alcoholic steatohepatitis AST>ALT with ratio of AST:ALT>2:1 while in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ALT>AST with ratio of ALT:AST>1.5:1.|$|E
50|$|Even {{though the}} LAGR vehicle had a WAAS GPS, its {{position}} was never determined {{down to the}} width of the vehicle, so it was hard for the systems to re-use obstacle maps of areas the robots had previously traversed since the GPS continually drifted.

25|$|Inrush {{current or}} input surge current or switch-on surge is the maximum, {{instantaneous}} input current drawn by an electrical device when first turned on. Inrush current usually lasts {{for half a}} second, or a few milliseconds, but it is often very high, which makes it dangerous because it can degrade and burn components gradually (over months or years), <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is no inrush current protection. Alternating current transformers or electric motors in automatic voltage regulators may draw and output several times their normal full-load current for a few cycles of the input waveform when first energized or switched on. Power converters also often have inrush currents much higher than their steady state currents, due to the charging current of the input capacitance.|$|E
25|$|Women {{may also}} express {{a desire to}} undergo an {{elective}} hysterectomy {{for reasons other than}} the resolution of reproductive system conditions or illnesses. Some of the conditions under which a person may request to have a hysterectomy (or have one requested for her if the woman is incapable of making the request) for non-illness reasons include may be as prophylaxis against certain reproductive system cancers, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is a strong family history of reproductive system cancers (especially breast cancer in conjunction with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation), or as part of recovery from such cancers. Some with severe developmental disabilities have had hysterectomies though this treatment is controversial at best. In the United States, specific cases of sterilization due to developmental disabilities have been found by state-level Supreme Courts to violate the patient's constitutional and common law rights.|$|E
500|$|Another {{method of}} launching, the [...] "autotow", is rarer nowadays. The direct autotow {{requires}} a hard surface {{and a powerful}} vehicle that {{is attached to the}} glider by a long steel cable. After gently taking up slack in the cable, the driver accelerates hard and as a result the glider rises rapidly to about 400metres (1,300ft), <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is a good headwind and a runway of [...] or more. This method has also been used on desert dry lakes.|$|E
50|$|Flying in a slip is aerodynamically inefficient, {{since the}} {{lift-to-drag}} ratio is reduced. More drag is at play consuming energy but not producing lift. Inexperienced or inattentive pilots will often enter slips unintentionally during turns {{by failing to}} coordinate the aircraft with the rudder. Airplanes can readily enter into a slip climbing out from take-off on a windy day. If left unchecked, climb performance will suffer. This is <b>especially</b> dangerous <b>if</b> <b>there</b> are nearby obstructions under the climb path and the aircraft is underpowered or heavily loaded.|$|R
50|$|Mashout is {{the term}} for raising the {{temperature}} of the mash to 170 F. This both stops the enzymatic conversion of starches to fermentable sugars, and makes the mash and wort more fluid. Mashout is considered <b>especially</b> necessary <b>if</b> <b>there</b> is less than 3 liters of water per kilogram of grain (1.5 quarts of water per pound of grain), or if the grain is more than 25% wheat or oats. The mashout step can be done by using external heat, or simply by adding hot water.|$|R

Captains of great ships behave exactly like two hansom-drivers in the streets of London; they think they can just shave past without grazing; and they DO shave past nine times out of ten. The tenth time they run on the rocks through sheer recklessness, and lose their vessel; and then, the newspapers always ask the same solemn question--in childish good faith--how did so experienced and able a navigator come to make such a mistake in his reckoning? He made NO mistake; he simply tried to cut it fine, and cut it too fine for once, with the result that he usually loses his own life and his passengers. That's all. We who have been at sea understand that perfectly." ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Planning {{agents in}} {{real-world}} environments {{have to face}} the Qualification Problem, i. e., the failure of an action execution due to unexpected circumstances. Sensing actions are used to derive additional state knowledge. We present a high-level programming method to combine these two approaches in the agent programming language FLUX, which builds on the general action representation formalism of the Fluent Calculus. It is shown how this combination allows for an efficient reasoning about the causes of unexpected action failures. The method is <b>especially</b> indicated <b>if</b> <b>there</b> are many possible reasons for a failure which have the same prior probabilities. The determined explanation for an action failure then helps an agent to recover from it. ...|$|R

The latter scenario highly increases the energy consumption of smartphones. In this paper, we investigate energy consumption with the focus on file downloading while scheduling multiple file downloads in two scenarios: serialized and parallel.

We assess the performance of the two scenarios via measurement of power consumption and corresponding download duration in a realistic environment...|$|R
