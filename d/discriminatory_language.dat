40|$|Introduction and aims: Mass {{media have}} become {{the main source of}} {{information}} on mental illness. In recent years, numerous studies documented a relationship between a stigmatizing presentation of psychiatric disorders and negative perception of mental illness by general population. This paper aims at analyzing how mental illness is described in scientific articles published by journals and magazines and delineating the average portrait of a psychiatric patient offered by media to the general population. Methods: Scientific articles published from 1957 until August 2010 were reviewed, collecting positive and negative expressions commonly associated to mental illness; a qualitative assessment method of these was then applied. Results: Negative descriptions of mental illness resulted by far more common than positive ones; generally, the tone and the negative attitude that describes mental illness are in the titles and in short articles, often sensational and dramatic, put on the front page, referring to stories of crime and danger. The titles are often inconsistent with the contents of the article. Moreover, there is a <b>discriminatory</b> and derogative <b>language</b> or a language of derision or pity. If there are positive descriptions, they are associated with the involvement of mental health experts, the active role of the psychiatric patient in the mass media or the effect produced by anti-stigma campaigns towards journalists. Conclusions: Although negative and stigmatizing depictions predominate, there are still opportunities for improving media reporting of mental illness, which should be taken up in future media strategies...|$|R

The global solidarity in responding to HIV/AIDS through the provision of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and encouraging early screening has been proved successful in saving lives of infected populations in past decades. However, there remain several challenges, one of which is how HIV/AIDS policies keep pace with the growing speed and diversity of migration flows. This study therefore aimed to examine the nature and the extent of HIV/AIDS health services, barriers to care, and epidemic burdens among cross-country migrants in low- and middle-income countries. Methods: A scoping review was undertaken by gathering evidence from electronic databases and gray literature from the websites of relevant international initiatives. The articles were reviewed according to the defined themes: epidemic burdens of HIV/AIDS, barriers to health services and HIV/AIDS risks, and the operational management of the current health systems for HIV/AIDS. Results: Of the 437 articles selected for an initial screening, 35 were read in full and mapped with the defined research questions. A high HIV/AIDS infection rate was a major concern among cross-country migrants in many regions, in particular sub-Saharan Africa. Despite a large number of studies reported in Africa, fewer studies were found in Asia and Latin America. Barriers of access to HIV/AIDS services comprised inadequate management of guidelines and referral systems, <b>discriminatory</b> attitudes, <b>language</b> differences, unstable legal status, and financial hardship. Though health systems management varied across countries, international partners consistently played a critical role in providing support for HIV/AIDS services to uninsured migrants and refugees. Conclusion: It was evident that HIV/AIDS health care problems for migrants were a major concern in many developing nations. However, there was little evidence suggesting if the current health systems effectively addressed those problems or if such management would sustainably function if support from global partners was withdrawn. More in-depth studies were recommended to further explore those knowledge gaps. Keywords: migrant, refugee, low- and middle-income countries, HIV/AIDS, health systems, scoping revie...|$|R

40|$|My {{dissertation}} discusses refugee {{rights and}} post-repatriation integration in South Asia {{in the context}} of debates over "citizenship. " Postcolonial state-formation processes in South Asia have profoundly shaped questions of belonging and membership. As a result, official citizenship has become an important marker of group inclusion and exclusion in South Asian states. Using the literature on citizenship, I discuss the "belonging" claims of non-citizens (refugees) and argue that in practice this "belonging" extends beyond the state-centric "citizenship" view of membership. In doing so, I address two sets of interrelated questions: what factors determine whether or not refugees will be repatriated in South Asia, and why do some repatriated groups re-integrate more successfully than others in "post-peace" South Asian states? I answer these questions through a study of refugees from Sri Lanka and Bangladesh who sought asylum in India and were later repatriated to their countries of origin. The politics of postcolonial state-formation and subsequent <b>discriminatory</b> policies on <b>language</b> in Sri Lanka and non-recognition of the Jumma people in Bangladesh encouraged many citizens to flee to India as refugees. I argue, first, that India's state-centric politics of non-recognition of the two refugee groups contributed to their later repatriation. In the absence of rights and status in exile, refugees turned to "home" as a place to belong. I then analyze the post-repatriation variations in accommodation in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh as most refugees attempted to reclaim the lost identity and "citizenship" at "home" through the process of repatriation. However these countries pursued strategies of limited accommodation, which led to the minimal or partial re-integration of the two returnee-refugee groups...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} in {{response}} to the 14 th, 15 th and 16 th periodic reports of the State of Israel to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD). This report demonstrates that Israel continues to ignore its international obligations towards asylum seekers and refugees which are predominately from sub-Sahara Africa. Various Israeli laws, policies and practices are racially discriminatory at their basis against this vulnerable population. For instance, Israel maintains a harsh policy of detention, tolerates segregation in the education system in Eilat and allocates temporary group protection to over 90 percent of the asylum seekers who arrive to Israel. As a result, asylum seekers live in constant fear of being returned to their countries of origin to face further persecution. The root of this discrimination stems from the tension created by Israel's sensitive political demographic status as a Jewish state. Several of Israel's high-ranking politicians have demonstrated an apparent lack of commitment in protecting the human rights of asylum seekers and eliminating racial discrimination. Their racially <b>discriminatory</b> and inciteful <b>language,</b> wholly adopted by the media, is at least partially responsible for generating the community-wide backlash against the asylum seekers that is documented in this report. This report is supplemented by a video report which provides visual documentation of the rising tide of hatred, fueled not only by certain Members of the Knesset but also by the Israeli community, and additional material not included in the written report. Whilst copies of the video have been provided to CERD, it can be viewed by members of the public at [URL] In closing ARDC offers recommendations where Israel could make advances in meeting its obligations under CERD. The report has been prepared with significant contribution by David Sheen, a journalist who has reported from Israel since 1999. In his work as a journalist, Sheen has extensively documented racial discrimination against many sectors in the Israeli community and particularly against the non-Jewish African asylum seekers. Together ARDC and Sheen are able to cite an extensive body of evidence to demonstrate that the Government of Israel has failed to meet its obligations under CERD with respect to this community. Additionally, our response to Articles 5 (d) and 5 (e) (v) regarding detention of unaccompanied minors and the segregation in the education system in Eilat were written with contributions from our partner organization Assaf [...] Aid Organization for Refugees and Asylum Seekers in Israel...|$|R
