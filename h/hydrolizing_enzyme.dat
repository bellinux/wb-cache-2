40|$|A {{paclitaxel}} prodrug has a paclitaxel portion {{coupled to}} a cleavable N-(aliphatic or aromatic) -O-glycosyl carbamate spacer group, {{and can be}} administered orally, topically or by injection to provide an anti-tumor effect, the prodrug being activated by a <b>hydrolizing</b> <b>enzyme,</b> an endogeneous enzyme or an exogeneous enzyme...|$|E
40|$|Utilization of {{by-product}} from agriculture as alternative {{source of}} feedstuff {{has been widely}} practiced. However their usage is limited due to high fiber content and low nutrient digestibility. The use of specific <b>hydrolizing</b> <b>enzymes,</b> xylanases are gaining importance because of their wide application in various industrial sectors especially in bioconversion of hemicellulosic material. This experiment was done to evaluate the effect of cation addition and immobilization of enzyme into pollard on stability of B. pumilus xylanase. The enzyme extract was purified by precipitation with 75 % ammonium sulphate. Four kinds of cation (Ca 2 +, Fe 3 +, Mg 2 +, Zn 2 +) {{were added to the}} purified enzyme, at concentration of 1 m M and stored at 4 and 27 ˚C. For immobilization process, the optimum enzyme concentration that will be added to pollard has been evaluated by analysis of xylanase activity and their recovery. The specific activity of enzyme after precipitation increased 1. 8 times, from 420. 3 to 765. 2 U/mg protein. All cations act as activator which relative activity become 130. 6; 139. 0; 103. 8 and 163. 5 % respectively. Concentration of 0. 5 mM Ca 2 + and Fe 3 + were most able to keep xylanases activity stable at 4 ˚C. The optimum composition of enzymes and pollard was 1. 5 ml for 5 gram of pollard with recovery of xylanases activity of 82. 2 %. In immobilized enzyme, the activity of enzyme without cation addition is higher than that with addition of Ca 2 + and Fe 3 +. Activity of enzyme stored at 4 ˚C is more stable than that at 27 ˚C. Immobilized enzyme is more stable for storage, which lasted for 7 weeks at 27 ˚C and 12 weeks at 4 ˚C compared to liquid enzyme which lasted for only 7 days at 27 ˚C and 13 days at 4 ˚C...|$|R
50|$|APCs usually {{internalise}} exogenous antigens by endocytosis, {{but also}} by pinocytosis, macroautophagy, endosomal microautophagy or chaperone-mediated autophagy. In the first case, after internalisation, the antigens are enclosed in vesicles called endosomes. There are three compartements involved in this antigen presentation pathway: early endosomes, late endosomes or endolysosomes and lysosomes, where antigens are <b>hydrolized</b> by lysosome-associated <b>enzymes</b> (acid-dependent hydrolases, glycosidases, proteases, lipases). This process is favored by gradual reduction of the pH. The main proteases in endosomes are cathepsins {{and the result is}} the degradation of the antigens into oligopeptides.|$|R
40|$|A proteolitic enzyme was {{purified}} from Bothrops brazili peruvian {{snake venom}} using Sephadex G- 100 followed by CM-Sephadex C- 50, in both two cases with 0. 05 M ammonium acetate pH 7, 0. The enzyme was purified 3, 2 fold with 52, 5 % of yield and by gel filtration the enzyme showed 18 000 of molecular weight, while the PAGE-SIDS showed only one protein band of 22 000 {{in the presence}} of mercaptoethanol and 20 300 under nonreducing conditions which suggests that the enzyme has a single polypeptide chain with disulfide bond. The <b>enzyme</b> <b>hydrolizes</b> fibrinogen, fibrin, casein and albumin, but not hemoglobin and mioglobin. The enzyme is a Aa-fibrinogenase because preferentially hydrolizes the Aa chain of the fibrinogen molecule. This activity is inhibited by EDTA but not by PMSF, TLCK, iodoacetate and pepstatin, suggests that is a metalloproteinase, however the ions Ca++, Mg++ and Zn++ cannot reactivate the inhibition by EDTA. Finally the enzyme is stable up to 45 °C and in its effect on fibrin the enzyme is to attack a chain rapidly...|$|R
