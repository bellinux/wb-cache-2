25|$|After Demian's invention, other {{accordions}} appeared, some featuring {{only the}} righthanded keyboard for playing melodies. It took English inventor Charles Wheatstone to squeeze both chords and keyboard {{together in one}} squeezebox. His 1844 patent <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> a “concertina” also featured the ability to easily tune the reeds from the outside with a simple tool.|$|E
25|$|The {{conductor}} Leopold Stokowski {{had introduced}} Ravel's version to Philadelphia audiences in November 1929; {{ten years later}} he produced his own very free orchestration (incorporating much re-composition), aiming <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> a more Slavic orchestral sound instead of Ravel's more Gallic approach. Stokowski revised his version {{over the years and}} made three gramophone recordings of it (1939, 1941 and 1965). The score, finally published in 1971, has since been recorded by other conductors, including Matthias Bamert, Gennady Rozhdestvensky, Oliver Knussen and José Serebrier.|$|E

25|$|Loneliness {{has been}} linked with depression, and is thus {{a risk factor for}} suicide. Émile Durkheim has {{described}} loneliness, specifically the inability or unwillingness to live for others, i.e. for friendships or altruistic ideas, as the main reason <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> egoistic suicide. In adults, loneliness is a major precipitant of depression and alcoholism. People who are socially isolated may report poor sleep quality, and thus have diminished restorative processes. Loneliness has also been linked with a Schizoid character type in which one may see the world differently and experience social alienation, described as the self in exile.|$|E
25|$|Earlier in the year, Alpha Oumar Konaré, the {{chairman}} of the commission of the African Union and former president of Mali, reportedly urged Bozizé not to stand for election. Bozizé gave an interview to Radio France Internationale on May 17 in which he refused to say whether or not he would run, but he confirmed that Konaré had spoken to him about it, while criticizing Konaré <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> interference in the country's affairs, and wondering whether he had consulted the opinions of the Central African people before getting involved. He stressed that the matter would depend on the will of the people. Some of his supporters campaigned prominently for him to stand. About 5,000 people walked in Bangui on June 19 to support his candidacy; Bozizé thanked them and asked for time to reflect.|$|E
500|$|There {{were not}} many {{customers}} for airplanes, {{so in the}} spring of 1910 the Wrights hired and trained a team of salaried exhibition pilots to show off their machines and win prize money for the company—despite Wilbur's disdain <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> [...] "the mountebank business". The team debuted at the Indianapolis Speedway on June 13. Before the year was over, pilots Ralph Johnstone and Arch Hoxsey died in air show crashes, and in November 1911 the brothers disbanded the team on which nine men had served (four other former team members died in crashes afterward).|$|E

500|$|Poulenc {{grew up in}} {{a musical}} household; his mother was a capable pianist, with a wide {{repertoire}} ranging from classical to less elevated works that gave him a lifelong taste <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> [...] "adorable bad music". He took piano lessons from the age of five; when he was eight he first heard the music of Debussy and was fascinated by the originality of the sound. Other composers whose works influenced his development were Schubert and Stravinsky: the former's Winterreise and the latter's The Rite of Spring made a deep impression on him. At his father's insistence, Poulenc followed a conventional school career, studying at the Lycée Condorcet in Paris rather than at a music conservatory.|$|E
500|$|The Search for Spocks plot {{solicited}} comment; Schickel {{called the}} film [...] "overplotted" [...] {{and filled with}} [...] "heavy expository burdens", comparing it to real opera. Sterritt said that the script occasionally veered in [...] "arbitrary" [...] directions and contained missteps, such as how the Grissom and its crew are suddenly lost, but the plot disregards their fate. Arnold wrote that Shatner missed an opportunity to act on par with The Wrath of Khans revelation that Kirk was David's father. The critic considered David's death an attempt at a similar shock, but felt {{it was not a}} success. Harry M. Geduld, writing for The Humanist, criticized the film <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> [...] "contradictions and implausibilities", such as Scott's sabotage of the Excelsior and Spock's regeneration.|$|E
500|$|The Bolton {{arm of the}} Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal was one of Dibnah's regular haunts. The canal was by then largely disused (the Bolton arm {{had been}} mostly closed in 1924) and Dibnah {{sometimes}} dredged it with an iron hook on a rope, <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> 'plunder'. [...] Much of this was stored {{in the back yard}} of his mother's house. Dibnah and his friend Alan Heap built a canoe from old bicycle wheels (cut in half to make the ribs), slate laths and a canvas sheet from the back of a lorry. Much to the consternation of his mother, Dibnah sailed the boat along the nearby River Croal. [...] He once astonished his teachers when, following the theft of the school keys, he cut new keys for each classroom door.|$|E

500|$|In 1997, Tony Blair {{was elected}} Prime Minister of the UK; his New Labour {{government}} expressed reticence toward restarting the land resettlement payments {{promised by the}} Lancaster House Agreement, with minister Clare Short rejecting {{the idea that the}} UK had any moral obligation to fund land redistribution. This attitude fuelled anti-imperialist sentiment across Africa. In October 1999, Mugabe visited Britain; in London, the human rights activist Peter Tatchell attempted to place him under citizen's arrest. Mugabe believed that the British government had deliberately engineered the incident to embarrass him. It further damaged Anglo-Zimbabwean relations, with Mugabe expressing scorn <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> [...] "Blair and company". In May 2000, the UK froze all development aid to Zimbabwe. In December 1999, the IMF terminated financial support for Zimbabwe, citing economic mismanagement and widespread corruption as impediments to reform.|$|E
500|$|Oasis {{had their}} first UK number one single in April 1995 with [...] "Some Might Say". At the same time, drummer Tony McCarroll was ousted from the band. McCarroll said, on leaving Oasis, that he was [...] "unlawfully {{expelled}} from the partnership" [...] <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> a [...] "personality clash" [...] with the brothers. The Gallaghers, on the other hand, doubted McCarroll's musical ability, with Noel saying: [...] "I like Tony as a geezer but he wouldn't {{have been able to}} drum the new songs". McCarroll was replaced by Alan White, formerly of Starclub and younger brother of renowned studio percussionist Steve White and recommended to Noel by Paul Weller. White made his debut for the band at a Top of the Pops performance of [...] "Some Might Say". Oasis began recording material for their second album in May of that year in Rockfield Studios near Monmouth. The band, by this point, had recorded the concert that would see release in August as Live by the Sea.|$|E
500|$|Pound {{could not}} {{understand}} Chinese himself, yet some critics see his translations of Chinese poetry as among the best (others complain of their mistakes). Cathay {{was the first of}} many translations Pound would make from the Chinese. Pound often followed the translations made by Herbert Giles in his History of Chinese Literature [...] and used Fenollosa's work as a starting point <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> the ideogrammic method, which proceeded on Fenellosa's entirely mistaken but fruitful idea that each character represented an image or pictograph, based on sight rather than sound. Robert Graves recalled [...] "I once asked Arthur Waley how much Chinese Pound knew; Waley shook his head despondently." [...] Steven Yao, scholar of American and Asian literature, sees Cathay as a [...] "major feat"; a work where Pound shows that translation is possible without a thorough knowledge of the source language. Yao does not view Pound's lack of Chinese as an obstacle, and states that the poet's trawl through centuries of scholarly interpretations resulted in a genuine understanding of the original poem.|$|E

500|$|Dennis Rubinshteyn of RPGFan {{was pleased}} by the soundtrack, saying that the music met his high {{expectations}} <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> the [...] "only redeeming quality left" [...] to the series since Legend of Mana. Summing the album up as a [...] "solid soundtrack with great songs {{and a lot of}} variety", he named Sekito's tracks as the least appealing on the soundtrack, causing some parts of the album as a whole to be [...] "hit or miss". Bryan Matheny of Square Enix Music Online held the opposite opinion, calling Sekito's pieces what [...] "made this work bearable" [...] and saying that he [...] "just can't get into this soundtrack", especially the first three discs, which were full of [...] "boring and underdeveloped" [...] tracks. Chris Greening of Square Enix Music Online's review, however, was more in line with RPGFan's, wherein he praised the [...] "diversity" [...] and [...] "glorious spectrum of emotion" [...] found in the soundtrack. He cited the synthesizer operation as a weak point as well as the order of the tracks, and singled out Sekito's tracks as [...] "forgettable" [...] and [...] "repetitive".|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{concluding}} scene involving Sophia's {{death was}} {{cited as the}} episode highlight. Janet Turley of The Huffington Post asserted that the sequence was [...] "fiction not afraid to provoke", while Goldman described it as an [...] "absolutely horrific scenario". CNN's Henry Hanks opined that the sequence [...] "left [...] with a final scene that we'll be talking about until then." [...] New York City Starlee Kine asserted that it contained cinematic qualities, and felt that the scene was [...] "satisfying, sad, and fun". She wrote: [...] "It was everything you've ever wanted this show to be. Zombies plus no dialogue, such a winning combination! And how great was it that Sophia was dead instead of impossibly alive somewhere, holed up with Merle or Morgan or those warmhearted gang members in Atlanta. And because she was granted more screen time than she ever was when she was alive, we were finally able {{to care about the}} loss of her short, young life." [...] Jen Chaney of The Washington Post echoed synonymous sentiments; [...] "Really, the final moments of the last episode before the AMC series' December/January hiatus played like a fireworks finale on the Fourth of July, assuming your Fourth of July celebrations typically involve zombies and a pile of corpses." [...] Rawlings concluded that it was the perfect resolution <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> [...] "television's slowest subplot". McIntyre felt that the concluding sequence was the most eventful moment of the episode, and stated that it was difficult to watch.|$|E
500|$|The series began {{development}} {{in the summer of}} 2003, when ABC senior vice president Thom Sherman [...] decided to order from Spelling Television a script based on an idea of network president Lloyd Braun, who envisioned a series that was a cross between the novel Lord of the Flies, the movie Cast Away, the television series Gilligan's Island, and the popular reality show Survivor. Braun had titled his concept Lost after a failed reality show that had broadcast in 2001. Writer Jeffrey Lieber was contacted by Spelling's vice president of series development Ted Gold, and in September 2003 pitched to ABC the concepts <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>called</b> Nowhere. Sherman approved the idea and hired Lieber to write a script, but Braun wound up rejecting Lieber's draft and subsequent rewrites. In January 2004 Braun contacted J. J. Abrams, who developed the TV series Alias for ABC, to write a new pilot script, which would retain the title Lost. Although initially hesitant, Abrams warmed up to the idea on the condition that the series would have a supernatural angle to it and he was assigned a writing partner. ABC executive Heather Kadin sent him Damon Lindelof, who had long intended to meet Abrams as he wished to write for Alias. Together, Abrams and Lindelof developed the characters and plot of Lost, along with creating a series [...] "bible" [...] which would store the major mythological ideas and plot points for an ideal five to six season run for the show. Lindelof and Abrams worked between January 13 and 16, when Lindelof sent a 21–page outline to ABC's executives. A complete first draft of the pilot script was delivered on February 24, and the teleplay kept on being revised, with the final script arriving on April 19. The development of the show was constrained by tight deadlines, as it had been commissioned late in the 2004 season's development cycle and Braun estimated that the whole process from writing to post-production took 6 to 8 weeks. Despite the short schedule, the creative team remained flexible enough to modify or create characters to fit actors they wished to cast.|$|E
