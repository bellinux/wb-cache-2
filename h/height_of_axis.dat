40|$|We {{report on}} a multi-year, multi-institution study to {{investigate}} student reasoning about energy {{in the context of}} quantum tunnelling. We use ungraded surveys, graded examination questions, individual clinical interviews, and multiple-choice exams to build a picture of the types of responses that students typically give. We find that two descriptions of tunnelling through a square barrier are particularly common. Students often state that tunnelling particles lose energy while tunnelling. When sketching wave functions, students also show a shift in the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> oscillation, as if the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> oscillation indicated the energy of the particle. We find inconsistencies between students' conceptual, mathematical, and graphical models of quantum tunnelling. As part of a curriculum in quantum physics, we have developed instructional materials to help students develop a more robust and less inconsistent picture of tunnelling, and present data suggesting that we have succeeded in doing so.

40|$|Background: Gonadotropins are {{commonly}} used for superovulation in human and animals to retrieve more oocyte and increase chance of pregnancy. Ovarian stimulation in assisted reproduction technology produces lower implantation rates per embryo transferred than natural and ovum donation cycles, suggesting suboptimal endometrial development due to the hormones used to recruit more oocytes. Due to the frequent use of gonadotropins {{in the treatment of}} infertility in successive periods, the aim {{of this study was to}} determine the endometrial changes in response to repeated ovarian stimulation. Methods: This experimental interventional study has done in research center of Hamadan university of medical sciences in 2012. NMRI female mice six weeks old were used in this study and divided into 7 groups (5 each). The mice in group 1, 2, 3 and 4 received 1, 2, 3 and 4 times pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) and 48 hours later 7. 5 IU human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) respectively. For each group were considered a control group which received on time gonadortropin injection. The mouses were killed 13 - 16 hours after hCG injection and middle part of uterine horn cut for histological study using Hematoxylin and Eosin staining. The parameters that studied were surface epithelium of endometrium, glandular epithelium, and endometrial <b>height</b> and <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> uterine gland. Results: Our results showed that there are no significant differences in glandular epithelium, <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> glands and <b>height</b> <b>of</b> endometrium in experimental groups (P> 0. 05). The <b>height</b> <b>of</b> surface epithelium showed significant increases after ovarian stimulation in experiment group (P≤ 0. 03). Our results showed that there are no significant differences in glandular epithelium, <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> glands, <b>height</b> <b>of</b> endometrium and <b>height</b> <b>of</b> surface epithelium between control groups and also it's experimental group (P> 0. 05). Conclusion: Changes in the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> surface epithelium could be one of the reasons for decrease implantation rates with repeated ovarian stimulation...|$|R
40|$|Character {{association}} studies {{among various}} vegetative and reproductive trains in groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) are important, {{because of the}} subterranean nature of pod development. Ninety-seven advanced generation selections derived from intersubspecific and intrasubspecific crosses were grown under high and low fertility environments for two years at ICRISAT to study the association among sixteen vegetative and reproductive traits. Only weight per mature seed {{with most of the}} vegetative traits and mature pods per plant, mature pod weight, mature seed per plant, and mature seed weight with <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the main <b>axis</b> and nodes with pegs showed significant positive association. Reproductive traits were significantly and positively associated among themselves.

40|$|In this report, {{the digital}} level is {{referred}} to a level that aims at bar-code staff and reads the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> that collimation <b>axis</b> automatically. We {{go back to the}} measurement principle of a digital level, and examine the reading accuracy. Hereafter, {{as long as there is}} no notice in particular, we treat the digital level NA 3000 and staff GPCL 3 manufactured by Leica. When using a digital level, we most worry about whether a level recognizes a sta scale correctly or not. Moreover, we also want to know the measurement accuracy. In this case, the quantity which must be grasped at least is the minimum resolution of a reading, and proportional relation between a reading and a staff scale. The results of our examination mostly confirm the characteristic of specifications given by Leica. The resolution of measured value was decided as 20 micrometers or less at the maximum. Furthermore, the error of linearity was presumed to be about 20 micrometers over 3 m staff. Since the stability and setting accuracy <b>of</b> horizontal <b>axis</b> are the basic performance of a level, we made those examinations of Leica digital level in the second half part of the report. ＜総説...|$|R

The analyses of the radar data for the AVE/VAS experiment provided statistically significant values {{for each of the}} 10 Km by 10 Km grids within radar range. The resulting information for correlation with satellite data included the following derived items that were averaged for each grid area: (1) rainfall rate in mm/hr; (2) dBZ (reflectivity) values; (3) accumulated rainfall values per hour; (4) accumulated rainfall values for a 6 -hour period; (5) vertically integrated liquid water content per square meter; and (6) vertical <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the radar <b>axis</b> at the midpoint of each grid. Additional products derived from radar data are being investigated. An example of one such product is the derivation of the errors in integrated rainfall with different sampling periods.

40|$|This {{study is}} a full-sounding prelude to the {{fundamental}} work on the morphology of inflorescences, which is being prepared by Prof. Dr. W. Troll of Mainz. All inflorescences in Valerianaceae are understood as modifications of one basic form, the thyrse. It is gratifying to note that forms of inflorescences, described in systematical works as for instance 1) capitate or interruptedly spicate (Plectritis), 2) compound dichasium, dichotomous throughout (cymoid Valeriana spp.), or dichotomously branched inflorescence (Valerianella), 3) ‘rispig bis fast trugdoldig’ (Phuodendron), in reality all are variations on one theme, the decussate mono-, to pleiothyrse, i. e. a simple to compound inflorescence with a racemous primary axis and cymous lateral axes. The transformations take place first of all by a favoured development of lateral axes on definite <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> the main <b>axis</b> (‘basi-mesotoner, akrotoner Förderungssinn’) and secondly {{by the number of}} flowers developing and the more or less pronounced tendency to form monochasia.

Lower doses of EMS (40 mM) and combinedtreatment of EMS 20 mM + gamma rays 20 kR proved effective in {{increasing the number of}} primary branches. Significant increase in number ofsecondary branches was observed in various treatments. Significant reduction in number of hanging pegs per plant was observed in 40 kRtreatment.

40|$|This {{data set}} {{contains}} a time series <b>of</b> plant <b>height</b> measurements (vegetative and reproductive) {{from the main}} experiment plots of a large grassland biodiversity experiment (the Jena Experiment; see further details below). In addition, data on species specific plant heights for the main experiment are available from 2002. In the main experiment, 82 grassland plots of 20 x 20 m were established {{from a pool of}} 60 species belonging to four functional groups (grasses, legumes, tall and small herbs). In May 2002, varying numbers of plant species from this species pool were sown into the plots to create a gradient of plant species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 60 species) and functional richness (1, 2, 3, 4 functional groups). Plots were maintained by bi-annual weeding and mowing. 1. Plant height was recorded, generally, twice a year just before biomass harvest (during peak standing biomass in late May and in late August). Methodologies <b>of</b> measuring <b>height</b> have varied somewhat over the years. In earlier year the streched plant height was measured, while in later years the standing height without streching the plant was measured. Vegetative height was measured either as the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the highest leaf or as the length <b>of</b> the main <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> non-flowering plants. Regenerating height was measured either as the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the highest flower on a plant or as the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the main <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> flowering. Sampled plants were either randomly selected in the core area of plots or along transects in defined distances. For details refer to the description of individual years. Starting in 2006, also the plots of the management experiment, that altered mowing frequency and fertilized subplots (see further details in the general description of the Jena Experiment) were sampled. 2. Species specific plant height was recorded two times in 2002 : in late July (vegetative height) and just before biomass harvest during peak standing biomass in late August (vegetative and regenerative height). For each plot and each sown species in the species pool, 3 plant individuals (if present) from the central area of the plots were randomly selected and used to measure vegetative height (non-flowering indviduals) and regenerative height (flowering individuals) as stretched height.
