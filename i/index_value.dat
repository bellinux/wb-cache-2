Conversely, calculations {{have been made by}} excluding the product category “Vehicles other than Railway or Tramway Rolling-Stock, and Parts and Accessories thereof,” using the HS. 87 product code to determine diversification in other exported products of Sakarya. In this instance, decreasing <b>index</b> <b>values</b> indicated diversified characteristics in other exporting markets.|$|R
5|$|At three {{sites on}} Hull Creek, the EPT (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera) Taxa Richness ranged from 4.00 to 16.00 in a 2013 study. The Total Taxa Richness ranged from 7.00 to 24.00. The Taxa Richness and the EPT Taxa Richness are {{the total number}} of macroinvertebrate taxa {{observed}} in a sample and {{the total number of}} those taxa that are in the three aforementioned orders, respectively. The Percent Intolerance Index ranged from 2.5% to 53% and the Beck's <b>Index</b> <b>value</b> ranged from 10.00 to 26.00. These two methods count individuals with PTVs of 0 to 3 and taxa with PTVs of 0 to 2, respectively. The Hilsenhoff Biotic <b>Index</b> <b>value</b> ranged from 0.28 to 2.70 and the Shannon Diversity <b>Index</b> <b>value</b> ranged from 1.45 to 2.05. The former is a method of determining community composition by considering both taxonomic richness and evenness of individuals. The latter is a count of individuals, weighted by pollution tolerance. The IBI Score of the creek ranged from 38.79 to 74.96.|$|E
25|$|The {{theoretical}} {{index of}} hair bending stiffness is calculated using the thickest and thinnest axial diameters of human hair, and this index differs by race. The hair stiffness indexes of Mongoloids, Africans and Europeans are: 4.23, 2.75 and 1.59, respectively. This means that Mongoloids {{with the highest}} hair stiffness <b>index</b> <b>value</b> of 4.23 have the most rigid hair and Europeans with the lowest hair stiffness <b>index</b> <b>value</b> of 1.59 have the least rigid hair. The eccentricity of hair cross-sectional shape index is also calculated using the thickest and thinnest axial diameters of human hair, and this index also differs by race. The hair eccentricity indexes of Africans, Europeans and Mongoloids are: 1.74, 1.49 and 1.30, respectively. This means that Africans with the highest hair eccentricity <b>index</b> <b>value</b> of 1.74 have the curliest hair and Mongoloids with the lowest hair eccentricity <b>index</b> <b>value</b> of 1.30 have the least curly hair.|$|E

40|$|Large sets {{of water}} quality data can leave water quality {{managers}} and decision-makers totally overwhelmed. In order {{to convey the}} interpretation of the data in a simplified and understandable manner, the water quality results from bi-monthly surveys undertaken at seven different sampling sites in the Letaba, Olifants, and Selati rivers over a two year period (February 1990 to April 1992) were reduced to <b>index</b> <b>values,</b> using a water quality index. The water quality index (Aquatic Toxicity Index or ATI) revealed spatial and temporal trends. The higher <b>index</b> <b>values,</b> recorded for the sampling sites towards {{the eastern part of the}} Kruger National Park (KNP), revealed that the water quality was better than the quality measured in the Olifants River on the western bound-ary. The lowest <b>index</b> <b>values</b> were calculated for the Selati River, with <b>index</b> <b>values</b> consistently below 50. <b>Index</b> <b>values</b> indicate that the water quality in the Selati River was unsuitable for supporting normal physiological processes in fish. The water quality of the Selati River had an immediate impact on the water quality of the Olifants River directly below the confluence. Lower <b>index</b> <b>values</b> recorded at sites further downstream was also attributed to the influence of the Selati River since there are no known point sources of contaminants within the boundaries of the KNP. The index scores also elucidated temporal trends with lower scores evident during winter months. This was due to reduced flow in the Olifants River and a greater contribution of contaminated water from the Selati River. <b>Index</b> <b>values</b> increased following the first seasonal rains due to a dilution effect. Very low <b>index</b> <b>values</b> were recorded at certain sites during flood periods due to increased turbidity, reduced oxygen, and increased metal concentrations...|$|R
30|$|Dividing by {{the total}} number of {{parameters}} involved in the computation of the GQI averages the data and limits the <b>index</b> <b>values</b> between 1 and 100. In this way, the impact of individual parameters is greatly reduced and the index computation is never limited to a certain number of chemical parameters. The “ 100 ” in the first part of the formula directly projected the GQI value, such that high <b>index</b> <b>values</b> close to 100 reflect high water quality and <b>index</b> <b>values</b> far below 100 (close to 1) indicate low water quality.|$|R

25|$|To {{calculate}} {{the value of}} the S 500 Index, the sum of the adjusted market capitalization of all 500 stocks is divided by a factor, usually referred to as the Divisor.

Although the adjusted market capitalization of the entire index can be accessed from Standard & Poor's website, the Divisor is considered to be proprietary to the firm. However, the Divisor's value is approximately 8.9 billion.|$|E

25|$|Where many {{calculations}} {{are done}} in sequence, the choice of rounding method can have a very {{significant effect on the}} result. A famous instance involved a new index set up by the Vancouver Stock Exchange in 1982. It was initially set at 1000.000 (three decimal places of accuracy), and after 22 months had fallen to about 520 — whereas stock prices had generally increased in the period. The problem was caused by the index being recalculated thousands of times daily, and always being rounded down to 3 decimal places, {{in such a way that}} the rounding errors accumulated. Recalculating with better rounding gave an <b>index</b> <b>value</b> of 1098.892 at the end of the same period.|$|E
25|$|The UV Index is {{a number}} linearly related to the {{intensity}} of sunburn-producing UV radiation at a given point on the earth's surface. It cannot be simply related to the irradiance (measured in W/m2) because the UV of greatest concern occupies a spectrum of wavelength from 295 to 325nm, and shorter wavelengths have already been absorbed a great deal when they arrive at the earth's surface. Skin damage from sunburn, however, is related to wavelength, the shorter wavelengths being much more damaging. The UV power spectrum (expressed as Watts per square metre per nanometre of wavelength) is therefore multiplied by a weighting curve known as the erythemal action spectrum, and the result integrated over the whole spectrum. This gave Canadian scientists a weighted figure (sometimes called Diffey-weighted UV irradiance, or DUV, or erythemal dose rate) typically around 250mW/m2 in midday summer sunlight. So, they arbitrarily divided by 25mW/m2 to generate a convenient <b>index</b> <b>value,</b> essentially a scale of 0 to 11+ (though ozone depletion is now resulting in higher values, as mentioned above).|$|E
