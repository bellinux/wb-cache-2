5|$|Made in Berlin in the 1930s, the Columbus Globe for State and Industry Leaders {{was located}} in Hitler's office {{throughout}} most of its existence. It became widely known in the United States after comedian Charlie Chaplin parodied it in his 1940 film The Great Dictator. Comedy group The Three Stooges also made <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> in two of their short subject comedies. One of the two limited editions was looted by John Barsamia, a private in the U.S. Army, at Hitler's summer retreat shortly {{after the war and}} sold 60 years later at an auction in San Francisco for $100,000. The globe in Hitler's office replaced Ethiopia with Italian East Africa and was known for its size as well as manufacturing cost.|$|E

25|$|Another curiosity is his Hidden Mickeys. Rosa is only {{interested}} in creating stories featuring the Duck family, but he often hides small Mickey Mouse heads or figures in the pictures, sometimes in a humiliating or unwanted situation. An {{example of this is}} in the story The Terror of the Transvaal where a flat Mickey can be seen under an elephant's foot. This is mostly a gag done for the <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> Rosa has admitted to neither liking nor disliking Mickey Mouse, but being indifferent to him.|$|E

25|$|Also in 1998, Dan Nastasi & John Milnes {{joined forces}} with former Mucky Pup and Dog Eat Dog bandmates Dave Neabore & Sean Kilkenny to become All Boro Kings. The project was {{a throwback to the}} early days of Dog Eat Dog as it focused on the {{hardcore}} style that Dog Eat Dog had originally displayed on their first two releases. The band quickly signed with Century Media Records who released their debut album Just For The <b>Fun</b> <b>Of</b> <b>It</b> in 2002. The album was released exclusively in Europe due to the strong European fan base the members had in their other bands. The band would also appear on several compilation albums. The band played most of their shows in and around New Jersey before embarking on one European tour with Biohazard, Agnostic Front, Hatebreed, Discipline, Death Threat and Born From Pain, as part of the Eastpak Resistance Tour. In 2004, All Boro Kings quietly disbanded.|$|E

500|$|Russian poet, {{novelist and}} {{composer}} Mikhail Kuzmin (1872–1936) {{is known to}} have patronized bathhouses. Some of the bathhouses in St. Petersburg at the time became known as friendly to gay men and provided [...] "attendants", who might provide sexual services for a fee. In his diary, Kuzmin writes of one bathhouse visit: the evening I had the urge to go to a bathhouse simply to be stylish, for the <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> for cleanliness.|$|E

500|$|... "Sweets and Sour Marge"'s plot is {{loosely based}} on the 2000 drama film Erin Brockovich, which {{revolves}} around Erin Brockovich's legal fight against the US West Coast energy corporation Pacific Gas and Electric Company. The Duff Book of World Records is a parody of the annually published reference book Guinness Book of World Records. Cereal mascot Count Fudgula is a spoof of the General Mills cereal mascot Count Chocula (who, in turn, parodies fictional character Count Dracula). After sugar becomes banned in Springfield, the town's police force can be seen burning confiscated sugar products. However, when they throw an amount of Butterfinger candy bars in the fire, the bars start to glow and are left intact. Disappointed, police chief Clancy Wiggum explains [...] "Butterfingers. Even fire doesn't want them." [...] For a long time, The Simpsons characters starred in Butterfinger commercials, which helped the series get launched by earning revenue from the commercials. Around the time [...] "Sweets and Sour Marge" [...] was written, the series contract with Butterfinger was terminated, and the staff therefore decided to make <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> [...] "If it had still been in existence, we wouldn't have done it", Jean said in the DVD commentary for the episode. Cletus' cousin Dia-Betty is {{loosely based on}} Darlene Cates' character Bonnie Grape in the 1993 film What's Eating Gilbert Grape. Before he agrees to hand the sugar cargo to Motherloving, Homer demands that he gets to see an Oompa Loompa, a character from the 1964 children's book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The Oompa Loompa's design {{is based on the}} version used in the 1971 film adaptation Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, which Kirkland watched in order to [...] "get [...] right." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the weekend}} on 4–5 March, {{members of the}} Singapore People's Party were at the Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC {{conducting}} a walk-about and selling $10 white T-shirts featuring a caricature of a red ant with boxing gloves. Teo Chee Hean (PAP), an incumbent MP for the GRC, made <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> saying [...] "I don't think our residents want their flats to be overrun by red ants". His fellow MP Charles Chong added: [...] "It would be very unfair if they come with ants and you use elephants to step on them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Coming Up for Air, {{his last}} novel before World War II {{is the most}} [...] "English" [...] of his novels; alarms of war mingle with images of idyllic Thames-side Edwardian {{childhood}} of protagonist George Bowling. The novel is pessimistic; industrialism and capitalism have killed the best of Old England, and there were great, new external threats. In homely terms, Bowling posits the totalitarian hypotheses of Borkenau, Orwell, Silone and Koestler: [...] "Old Hitler's something different. So's Joe Stalin. They aren't like these chaps {{in the old days}} who crucified people and chopped their heads off and so forth, just for the <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> <b>it...</b> They're something quite new – something that's never been heard of before".|$|E

2500|$|His {{first stage}} {{appearance}} was at age 13 but his early hopes {{of becoming a}} serious actor were dashed when he failed an audition for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. He began to entertain during World War II service in the British Army. It was {{at this time that}} he adapted his surname to Howerd [...] "to be different". In 1944 he became a bombardier in Plymouth, was promoted to sergeant, and on 6 June 1944 was part of the D-Day effort but was stuck on a boat off Normandy. Despite suffering from stage fright, he continued to work after the war, beginning his professional career in the summer of 1946 in a touring show called For the <b>Fun</b> <b>of</b> <b>It.</b>|$|E
2500|$|After {{almost four}} years, Elliott {{came out of}} {{retirement}} {{on the national level}} on Saturday October 28, 1989, when she raced the ABA's Fall National in Yorba Linda, Californiaapparently for the <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> due to her ABA BMX Hall of Fame induction the following November. She probably thought she would be at the ABA Grand Nationals anyway for her acceptance speech, why not race as well? Other reports have it that Elliott was lured out of retirement by the Bicycle Center bicycle shop as a [...] "spoiler" [...] to better position other Bicycle Center racers to take various titles. Whatever the reason, prior to the Fall Nationals she was seen practicing at the Roseville, California Oak Creek BMX track. She dominated the 15 & Over girls' class at the Fall Nationals on Saturday. However, she slipped her pedals in the Main and finished in seventh place—last, in this case—in the main. On Sunday, she again came in last (out of six) in the main.|$|E
2500|$|Hippias Minor (...) , or On Lying, {{is thought}} to be one of Plato's early works. Socrates matches wits with an arrogant polymath, who is also a smug {{literary}} critic. Hippias believes that Homer can be taken at face value, and he also thinks that Achilles may be believed when he says he hates liars, whereas Odysseus' resourceful (...) behavior stems from his ability to lie well (365b). Socrates argues that Achilles is a cunning liar who throws people off the scent of his own deceptions and that cunning liars are actually the [...] "best" [...] liars. Consequently, Odysseus was equally false and true and so was Achilles (369b). Socrates proposes, possibly for the sheer dialectical <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> that it is better to do evil voluntarily than involuntarily. His case rests largely on the analogy with athletic skills, such as running and wrestling. [...] He says that a runner or wrestler who deliberately sandbags is better than the one who plods along because he can do no better.|$|E
5000|$|None of the NASCAR drivers lampooned in [...] "Poor and Stupid" [...] were {{reported}} to be offended by their depiction in the episode.
