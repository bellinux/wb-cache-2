40|$|Objectives: To {{perform an}} {{evaluation}} from the societal {{perspective of the}} cost of treatment with <b>enoxaparin</b> <b>sodium</b> versus unfractionated heparin (UFH) in patients with unstable angina and non-Q wave myocardial infarction in France. Design: Four complementary cost-minimisation analyses {{based on the results of}} the Efficacy and Safety of Subcutaneous Enoxaparin in Non-Q wave Coronary Events (ESSENCE) international trial were conducted. We assessed differences in medical resource consumption and in duration of hospital stay in the whole study population (n = 3171) and for the French patients (n = 133). Results: Results were consistent for the study group as a whole and for the French subgroup. Among patients treated with <b>enoxaparin</b> <b>sodium,</b> there was a statistically significant reduction in the use of angiography and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (whole group study: p = 0. 024 and 0. 006, respectively) and a trend towards shorter lengths of hospital stay. The differences in angiography and angioplasty rates led to estimated average net cost savings with <b>enoxaparin</b> <b>sodium</b> of French Francs (FF) 1555 per treated patient (whole study population) and FF 9993 (French subgroup) [1996 values]. The analyses based on the duration of hospital stay resulted in estimated net cost savings with <b>enoxaparin</b> <b>sodium</b> of between FF 1014 per treated patient (whole study population) and FF 2804 (French subgroup). Conclusion: Our study confirmed earlier results which show that <b>enoxaparin</b> <b>sodium</b> is cost saving in the treatment of unstable angina.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of <b>sodium</b> <b>enoxaparin</b> treatment on patients with noise-induced hearing loss. Methods: Sixty patients with noise-induced hearing loss were included and randomly divided into two numerically equal groups. Group A underwent therapy with <b>sodium</b> <b>enoxaparin</b> for 10 days, followed by an additional 10 days of treatment after 10 days of no treatment. Group B received placebo as a control. Before treatment, at the end of treatment, and 2 months after the end of treatment, all patients underwent evaluation by laboratory tests, pure tone audiometry, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) testing, distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) testing, and auditory brain stem response testing. Results: In contrast to group B, at the end of the treatment in group A pure tone audiometry showed a significant (p < 0. 05) improvement of the audiometric thresholds at 0. 5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 kHz. Depending on the air and bone conduction thresholds, TEOAEs and DPOAEs, which had previously been absent, were evoked at the frequencies examined. These improvements were confirmed at last follow-up. We found no significant differences in auditory brain stem responses or laboratory results.

40|$|The audiovestibular {{system can}} be {{affected}} by an immunological etiology; the presence of immune mediated sensorineural hearing loss (IMSNHL) as part of or {{in combination with other}} autoimmune diseases is well documented in the literature. Hearing loss can be caused by autoimmune disorders localized to the inner ear or secondary to systemic immune diseases (Cogan's syndrome, juvenile chronic arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Wegener's granulomatosis, scleroderma, pulseless disease, and SLE). A systemic autoimmune disorder can be present in fewer than one-third of cases The clinical presentation of immune inner-ear disease is extremely variable and depends on the type of immune reaction and on the site of injury within the inner ear. IMSNHL typically presents with an idiopathic, progressive unilateral and successive bilateral rapidly progressive sensorineural hearing loss; the course of the hearing loss occurs over weeks to months and is most common in middle-aged women; it may be accompanied by tinnitus and vertigo and is almost always unilateral. IMSNHL is still a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma, and predicting recovery from it is very difficult. Different factors may influence a prognosis: e. g., severity of hearing loss, duration of symptoms before treatment, presence of vertigo, type of audiogram, and age of patients. The therapeutic approaches normally used for this pathological condition include the systemic and local administration of cortisone, vasoactive agents, anticoagulants, vitamin complexes, a cytotoxic agent and plasmapheresis. These drugs can be effective in reversing such hearing loss, although at the cost of occasionally severe side effects. Currently, evaluating the importance of an autoimmune phenomenon in the genesis of inner-ear disease is difficult because the clinical and biological criteria of autoimmune deafness have not yet been well defined. A positive response to treatment is a criterion for the diagnosis of immune inner-ear disease. This chapter aims to assess the effect of <b>sodium</b> <b>enoxaparin</b> on the recovery of hearing in patients affected by ISSNHL. <b>Sodium</b> <b>enoxaparin</b> was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 4, 000 IU once a day for 10 days. <b>Sodium</b> <b>enoxaparin</b> is a particular kind of heparin with a low molecular weight (LMWH) and is endowed with a high antithrombotic activity.

40|$|Background: It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that major orthopaedic surgery has the highest risk of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) when compared with other surgery. Two new orally active anticoagulants have recently become licensed in Ireland for the primary prevention of venous thromboembolism in adult patients undergoing elective total hip replacement (THR) or total knee replacement (TKR). Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) is a direct factor Xa inhibitor and dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa) is a prodrug of the active compound dabigatran, which inhibits thrombin. Objective: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of rivaroxaban and dabigatran etexilate compared with <b>enoxaparin</b> <b>sodium</b> for the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing elective THR and TKR in the Irish healthcare setting. Methods: The evaluation was conducted from the Irish health-payer perspective. A static decision-tree model was developed with a 180 -day post-surgery time horizon. Separate models for the disease states THR and TKR were run to accommodate the different venous thromboembolism risks associated with each procedure. Outcome measures were QALYs and life-years gained (LYG). Costs were valued in &U 20 AC;, year 2008 values. One-way sensitivity analysis of all probabilities in the model was performed. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis using second-order Monte Carlo simulation was performed to determine the probability of cost effectiveness at a &U 20 AC; 45 [*] 000 per QALY threshold. Results: In the THR base-case model, rivaroxaban dominated both dabigatran etexilate and <b>enoxaparin</b> <b>sodium.</b> The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for dabigatran etexilate relative to enoxaparin were &U 20 AC; 23 [*] 934 per LYG and &U 20 AC; 17 [*] 835 per QALY. In the TKR base-case model, rivaroxaban dominated both dabigatran etexilate and <b>enoxaparin</b> <b>sodium.</b> Dabigatran etexilate also dominated <b>enoxaparin</b> <b>sodium.</b> In the one-way sensitivity analysis, the THR model was robust to all but four probability variations; the TKR model was robust to all variations. At a cost-effectiveness threshold of &U 20 AC; 45 [*] 000 per QALY, the probability that rivaroxaban was the most cost-effective strategy after THR was 39 %, followed by dabigatran etexilate at 32 % and <b>enoxaparin</b> <b>sodium</b> at 29 %. The probability that rivaroxaban was the most cost-effective strategy after TKR was 46 %, followed by dabigatran etexilate at 30 % and <b>enoxaparin</b> <b>sodium</b> at 24 %. Conclusion: Base-case analysis indicates that when both rivaroxaban and dabigatran etexilate are compared with <b>enoxaparin</b> <b>sodium,</b> rivaroxaban is the less costly and more effective option after THR and TKR. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicates that rivaroxaban is the most cost-effective strategy at a cost-effectiveness threshold of &U 20 AC; 45 [*] 000 per QALY; however, there is uncertainty regarding this strategy being more cost effective than dabigatran etexilate when both are compared with <b>enoxaparin</b> <b>sodium.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered <b>enoxaparin</b> <b>sodium</b> during and after pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: Daily subcutaneous injections of <b>enoxaparin</b> <b>sodium</b> (40 mg) were administered to 13 pregnant women. On 3 separate occasions, once early in pregnancy (12 - 15 weeks), once late in pregnancy (30 - 33 weeks), and once in the nonpregnant state (6 - 8 weeks post partum), serial blood samples were col-lected, and plasma was analyzed for antifactor Xa activity. Analysis of variance was used for statistical analy-sis. P <. 05 was significant. RESULTS: The time to maximum concentration and the mean residence time in pregnancy compared with the postpartum state were not significantly different. During early and late pregnancy, maximum concentra-tion and the last measurable anti–factor Xa activity level were lower than in the nonpregnant state (P <. 05). The area under the plasma activity–versus–time curve was significantly lower in pregnancy than in the post-partum state (P <. 05). CONCLUSION: The pharmacokinetics of <b>enoxaparin</b> <b>sodium</b> are significantly different during pregnancy than in the same women when nonpregnant. The observed difference is likely because of increased renal clearance of enoxaparin during pregnancy. This finding has significant implications for appropriate dosing o...|$|E
40|$|Pregnancy is a {{condition}} of increased affinity to blood clotting. The most important changes of coagulation system in pregnancy involve the increase of the following coagulation factors: fibrinogen production, level of numerous blood coagulation factors- FII, FVII, FVIII, FX, FXII, acquired activated protein C resistance, and the decrease of: fibrinolysis due to the increase {{of a large number}} of fibrinolytic activator inhibitors PAI- 1 and PAI- 2, thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor TAFI, and levels of proteins S and C. This disease is not a disease on its own, but a group of inherited and acquired coagulation disorders that increase the predisposition to thrombosis. The treatment of choice in pregnancy are low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) which are derived from standard heparin by controlled hydrolysis, thus obtaining heparins of a lower molecular mass. The most commonly used LMWHs are: dalteparin <b>sodium,</b> <b>enoxaparin,</b> nadroparin-calcium, reviparin. LMWH is given in prophylactic doses – low and medium doses in therapeutic doses.

40|$|The authors {{propose the}} {{existence}} of a new entity of autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss on the basis of diagnostic study and treatment experience with a series of 30 patients. Immunological mechanisms {{play an important role in}} the pathogenesis and natural course of various inner-ear diseases. Patients may present clinically with symptoms resembling Ménière's disease or even with sudden deafness. Currently, no widely used standard protocol for treatment of this autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss exists. Prompted by such observations, we implemented a protocol using a particular kind of heparin - sodium enoxaparin-with a low molecular weight. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups; to those in the first group, enoxaparin was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 2, 000 IU twice daily for 10 days; the patients in the second group were treated with placebo. At the beginning and at the end of the therapy period, the patients were evaluated by instrumental examinations. Specifically excluded were patients with abnormal known coagulation. On discharge, all patients treated with enoxaparin presented both a subjective and objective decrease in symptoms. No patient experienced side effects from this treatment.

Methods: In Sprague Dawley rats, an AVL was created on femoral vessels and inserted into a polycarbonate chamber in the groin in 3 control groups (Series I) and 3 experimental groups (Series II). Two hours before surgery and 6 hours post-surgery, saline (Series I) or <b>enoxaparin</b> <b>sodium</b> (0. 6 mg/kg, Series II) was administered intra-peritoneally.

40|$|The most well {{established}} antithrombotic treatment for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is unfractionated heparin (UFH) plus aspirin, but such treatment may not prevent arterial thrombotic events. Low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) and platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitors offer alternative or adjunctive treatments. However, before these alternatives with higher acquisition costs are accepted in today This paper reviews international pharmacoeconomic {{studies on the}} use of LMWHs and GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in patients with ACS in an attempt to determine whether these therapies are cost effective. Most of the studies on LMWHs have been cost-minimisation analyses and have focused on <b>enoxaparin</b> <b>sodium,</b> because this is the only LMWH proven to be superior to UFH. Several analyses show that, compared with UFH plus aspirin, <b>enoxaparin</b> <b>sodium</b> provides cost savings both during hospitalisation (30 days) and 1 -year follow-up. These cost savings are mainly attributable to fewer cardiac interventions, shorter hospital stays and lower administrative costs. Indeed, the clinical and economic advantages of <b>enoxaparin</b> <b>sodium</b> have led to its recommendation in recent guidelines as the antithrombotic agent of choice for coronary artery disease. Most of the economic analyses of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors have been cost-effectiveness analyses. Such analyses indicate that the high acquisition costs of these drugs may be at least partially offset by reductions in other costs if a noninvasive approach to risk stratification is used. Furthermore, use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors appears to give favourable cost-effectiveness ratios compared with other accepted therapies, such as fibrin-specific thrombolytic therapy, in the cardiovascular field, particularly in high-risk patients and those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. However, more comprehensive economic data on the GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors are needed. Acute-coronary-syndromes, Cost-analysis, GPIIb-IIIa-antagonists, Low-molecular-weight-heparins...|$|E

40|$|A simple, {{selective}} {{and accurate}} capillary electrophoresis (CE) method {{has been developed}} for the rapid separation and identification of various low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) and unfractionated heparin. Separation and operational parameters were investigated using dalteparin sodium as the test LMWH. The developed method used a 70 cm fused silica capillary (50 m i. d.) with a detection window 8. 5 cm from the distal end. Phosphate electrolyte (pH 3. 5; 50 mM), an applied voltage of − 30 kV, UV detection at 230 nm and sample injection at 20 mbar for 5 s were used. The method performance was assessed in terms of linearity, selectivity, intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy. The method was successfully applied to the European Pharmacopeia LMWH standard, dalteparin sodium, <b>enoxaparin</b> <b>sodium</b> and heparin sodium with {{a significant reduction in}} the run time and increased resolution compared with previously reported CE methods. Different CE separation profiles were obtained for various LMWHs and unfractionated heparin showing significant structural diversity. The current methodology was sensitive enough to reveal minor constituent differences between two different batches of <b>enoxaparin</b> <b>sodium.</b> This CE method also clearly showed chemical changes that occurred to LMWHs under different stress conditions. The sensitivity, selectivity and simplicity of the developed method allow its application in research or manufacturing for the identification, stability analysis, characterization and monitoring of batch-to-batch consistency of different low molecular weight and unfractionated heparins. © 2007 Elsevier B.

ConclusionIn this in vivo tissue engineering model, endogenous, extra-vascularly deposited fibrin volume determines construct size and vascular growth in the first 3 weeks and is, therefore, critical to full construct development. Clinical RelevanceTissue engineering is an expanding field and ultimately has the potential of growing new organs and tissues for replacement of damaged or lost organs. The Bernard O'Brien Institute of Microsurgery (Melbourne, Australia) has developed an in vivo model in which a surgically created arteriovenous loop (AVL) created on the rat femoral vessels and placed in an empty poly-carbonate chamber under the groin skin exudes a fibrin matrix that fills the chamber in the first day. Capillaries begin sprouting from the femoral vein portion of the AVL 3 - 5 days later, supported by the fibrin matrix (Lokmic et al). 5 The chamber is filled to about three-quarters full with vascularized connective tissue in about 3 weeks. The endogenous fibrin scaffold is an integral part of the construct. Many tissue engineering models use biological or synthetic scaffolds to support and maintain the construct. This study looks at the significance of this endogenous fibrin scaffold by partially inhibiting its formation using <b>enoxaparin</b> <b>sodium</b> (an inhibitor of fibrin polymerization) and subsequently comparing with untreated controls, construct weight, and volume and vascularization over the following 3 weeks. Utilizing endogenous fibrin scaffolds has enormous potential for in vivo tissue engineering, particularly in growing large three dimensional vascularized tissues. Endogenous fibrin scaffolds are biologically compatible with the host and will not provoke an inflammatory or foreign body response.

Methods: An international, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial (MEDENOX) has previously been conducted in 1102 acutely ill, immobilized general medical patients and has shown the efficacy of using a low-molecular-weight heparin, <b>enoxaparin</b> <b>sodium,</b> in preventing thrombosis. We performed logistic regression analysis to evaluate the independent nature {{of different types of}} acute medical illness (heart failure, respiratory failure, infection, rheumatic disorder, and inflammatory bowel disease) and predefined factors (chronic heart and respiratory failure, age, previous VTE, and cancer) as risk factors for VTE. Results: The primary univariate analysis showed that the presence of an acute infectious disease, age older than 75 years, cancer, and a history of VTE were statistically significantly associated with an increased VTE risk. Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that these factors were independently associated with VTE. Conclusions: Several independent risk factors for VTE were identified. These findings allow recognition of individuals at increased risk of VTE and will contribute to the formulation of an evidence-based risk assessment model for thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized general medical patients...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this work}} were {{preparation}} and physical-chemical characterization of a microparticulate release system for delivery of <b>enoxaparin</b> <b>sodium</b> (ENX), a low-molecular-weight heparin, as a potential vehicle for optimization of deep venous thrombosis therapy. Microparticles (MPs) containing ENX were prepared from polylactide-co-glycolic acid [PLGA; (50 : 50) ] by a double emulsification/solvent evaporation method. The preparation parameters, such as proportion ENX/PLGA, surfactant concentration, type, time, and speed of stirring, were evaluated. The encapsulation efficiency and yield process were determined and optimized, and the in vitro release profile was analysed at 35 days. The MPs showed a spherical shape with smooth and regular surfaces. The size distribution showed a unimodal profile with an average size of 2. 0 +/- 0. 9 mu m. The low encapsulation efficiency (< 30 %), characteristic of hydrophilic macromolecules was improved, reaching 50. 2 % with a procedure yield of 71. 3 %. The in vitro profile of ENX release from the MPs was evaluated and showed pseudo-zero-order kinetics. This indicated that diffusion was the main drug release mechanism.

40|$|Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) are frequent-ly used {{anticoagulants}} {{in adults}} where thrombosis is common. Although thrombosis is less frequent in pediatric patients, {{the desire to}} use an LMWH {{in the event of}} ve-nous thromboembolism is gaining favor. The LMWHs, usually given subcutaneously, are currently available in concentrated form to minimize injection volume. Since dos-ing of LMWHs is usually weight based, smaller-weight patients, such as younger children, may require a dose that is lower than what is currently feasible using commercially available concentrations. Of the presently available LMWH agents, <b>enoxaparin</b> <b>sodium</b> (Lovenox, Aventis, Bridgewa-ter, NJ) has the most data supporting its use in pediatric pa-tients. 1 - 3 The benefits of using LMWHs to facilitate at-home treatment in adults have been described. 4 The use of outpatient LMWH for pediatric patients may also be of benefit. To safely and accurately provide dosing for low-weight patients, the use of diluted, prefilled unit-dose syringes would be desirable. A dilution to 20 mg/mL of enoxaparin has been described with a stated expiration time of 24 hours under refrigeration after preparation. 5 However, di-luting on a daily basis could cause significant logistical challenges (daily preparation, delivery of the product), in-creased costs (labor, drug wastage), or undesirable risk...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLow-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) {{are complex}} {{anticoagulant}} drugs, made from heparin porcine mucosa starting material. <b>Enoxaparin</b> <b>sodium</b> manufactured by Sanofi {{is one of}} the most widely prescribed LMWHs and has been used since 1993 in the USA. In 2010, US Food and Drug Administration approval for supplying generic enoxaparin was granted to Sandoz and subsequently to Amphastar. Little is known, however, of the differences in composition of these preparations. In this study, samples from several batches of generic enoxaparins were purchased on the US market and analyzed with state of the art methodologies, including disaccharide building blocks quantification, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and a combination of orthogonal separation techniques. Direct high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of the different enoxaparin batches revealed distinct process fingerprints associated with each manufacturer. Disaccharide building block analysis showed differences in the degree of sulfation, the presence of glycoserine derivatives, as well as in proportions of disaccharides. Results were compared by statistical approaches using multivariate analysis with a partial least squares discriminant analysis methodology. The variations were statistically significant and allowed a clear distinction to be made between the enoxaparin batches according to their manufacturer. These results were further confirmed by orthogonal analytical techniques, including NMR, which revealed compositional differences of oligosaccharides both in low- and high-affinity antithrombin fractions of enoxaparin...|$|E

The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the effects of enoxaparin on histomorphometric parameters of bones in female Wistar rats (13 – 15 weeks old at the beginning of the experiment). Enoxaparin was administered at doses of 1000 anti-Xa IU/kg sc daily or 2000 anti-Xa IU/kg sc daily for 4 weeks.

A cost-utility analysis using a decision tree model was conducted using societal and healthcare payers’ perspectives to simulate relevant costs and health outcomes covering a 3 -month time horizon. Costs were adjusted to year 2014. The willingness-to-pay threshold of THB 160, 000 (USD 4926) was used. One-way sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analyses using a Monte Carlo simulation were performed. Compared with no VTE prophylaxis, dabigatran and enoxaparin after THR and TKR surgery incurred higher costs and increased quality adjusted life years (QALYs). However, their incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were {{high above the}} willingness to pay. Compared with enoxaparin, dabigatran for THR/TKR lowered VTE complications but increased bleeding cases; dabigatran was cost-saving by reducing the costs [by THB 3809. 96 (USD 117. 30) for THR] and producing more QALYs gained (by 0. 00013 for THR). Dabigatran (vs. enoxaparin) had a 98 % likelihood of being cost effective. Dabigatran is cost-saving compared to enoxaparin for VTE prophylaxis after THR or TKR under the Thai context.

40|$|Background: The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, in {{collaboration}} with the Health Services Executive, considers the cost effectiveness of all new medicines introduced into Ireland. Health Technology Assessments (HTAs) are conducted in accordance with the existing agreed Irish HTA guidelines. These guidelines do not specify a formal analysis of value of information (VOI). Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} demonstrate the benefits of using VOI analysis in decreasing decision uncertainty and to examine the viability of applying these techniques as part of the formal HTA process for reimbursement purposes within the Irish healthcare system. Method: The evaluation was conducted from the Irish health payer perspective. A lifetime model evaluated the cost effectiveness of rivaroxaban, dabigatran etexilate and <b>enoxaparin</b> <b>sodium</b> for the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism after total hip replacement. The expected value of perfect information (EVPI) was determined directly from the probabilistic analysis (PSA). Population-level EVPI (PEVPI) was determined by scaling up the EVPI according to the decision incidence. The expected value of perfect parameter information (EVPPI) was calculated for the three model parameter subsets: probabilities, preference weights and direct medical costs. Results: In the base-case analysis, rivaroxaban dominated both dabigatran etexilate and <b>enoxaparin</b> <b>sodium.</b> PSA indicated that rivaroxaban had the highest probability of being the most cost-effective strategy over a threshold range of &U 20 AC; 0 -&U 20 AC; 100 [*] 000 per QALY. At a threshold of &U 20 AC; 45 [*] 000 per QALY, the probability that rivaroxaban was the most cost-effective strategy was 67 %. At a threshold of &U 20 AC; 45 [*] 000 per QALY, assuming a 10 -year decision time horizon, the PEVPI was &U 20 AC; 11. 96 [*]million and the direct medical costs subset had the highest EVPPI value (&U 20 AC; 9. 00 [*]million at a population level). In order to decrease uncertainty, a more detailed costing study was undertaken. In the subsequent analysis, rivaroxaban continued to dominate both comparators. In the PSA, rivaroxaban continued to have the highest probability of being optimal over the threshold range &U 20 AC; 0 -&U 20 AC; 100 [*] 000 per QALY. At &U 20 AC; 45 [*] 000 per QALY, the probability that rivaroxaban was the most cost-effective strategy increased to 80 %. At &U 20 AC; 45 [*] 000 per QALY, the 10 -year PEVPI decreased to &U 20 AC; 3. 58 [*]million and the population value associated with the direct medical costs fell to &U 20 AC; 1. 72 [*]million. Conclusion: This increase in probability of cost effectiveness, coupled with a substantially reduced potential opportunity loss could influence a decision maker's confidence in making a reimbursement decision. On discussions with the decision maker we now intend to incorporate the use of VOI into our HTA process...|$|E
40|$|The pharmacoeconomics {{of the low}} {{molecular}} weight heparin (LMWH) enoxaparin in the prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism have mostly been investigated in cost-effectiveness studies that estimated direct costs associated with treatment, using decision analyses and clinical outcome data from randomised controlled trials. These studies have shown enoxaparin to be cost effective compared with unfractionated heparin (UFH) and warfarin in short-term thromboprophylaxis for hospital inpatients undergoing orthopaedic surgery and in thromboprophylaxis following trauma. Outpatient treatment of acute proximal deep vein thrombosis with enoxaparin {{has also been shown}} to be cost effective compared with inpatient treatment using UFH. In general surgery, however, it remains to be determined whether enoxaparin is a cost-effective alternative to UFH. The cost effectiveness of enoxaparin compared with UFH in the treatment of unstable angina and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction has also been investigated in several countries using clinical outcomes data from the Efficacy and Safety of Subcutaneous Enoxaparin in Non-Q-wave Coronary Events (ESSENCE) randomised trial. ESSENCE demonstrated that enoxaparin was superior to UFH in terms of tolerability and efficacy, and cost saving at both 30 -day and 1 -year follow-ups.

The scrotum was enlarged and warm to touch, and associated skin was noted to be lichenified on physical examination. The penis {{could not be}} extruded due to preputial swelling. Results from the following diagnostic tests were all unremarkable or within normal limits: scrotal aspirate, hematology, serum biochemistries, urinalysis, and radiography of the thorax, scrotum, and abdomen. Ultrasonography of lower extremities identified thrombi in bilateral iliac veins and left femoral vein. Collateral circulation surrounding the left femoral vein permitted some compensatory venous return. The left femoral vein of this animal had been catheterized approximately 2 mo before initial presentation. A coagulation panel revealed a positive D-dimer test, indicative of elevated levels of fibrin degradation products due to active thrombus breakdown. <b>Enoxaparin</b> <b>sodium,</b> a low-molecular-weight heparin for human use, was administered at 20 mg subcutaneously once daily for 10 d to treat occlusive venous thrombi.

40|$|Objectives: This {{prospective}} pharmacoeconomic study {{analyses and}} discusses the cost effectiveness (expressed as cost per life-year gained) of desirudin {{in comparison with}} a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), enoxaparin, as prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in total hip replacement. Methods: The cost effectiveness was analysed {{on the basis of}} results from a clinical trial that compared the recombinant hirudin, desirudin, with the LMWH, enoxaparin. The trial results regarding the incidence of DVT are included together with epidemiological data in a decision tree, simulating long term cost effectiveness of patients undergoing elective hip replacement. The model includes Markov processes simulating patients up to the age of 85 years, including the costs of DVT-related long term complications. Results: The average total thrombosis-related cost per patient under prophylactic therapy with enoxaparin is 7022 Swedish kronor (SEK) compared with SEK 7497 when using desirudin (1998 values). The total costs with desirudin are 7 % higher. Prophylaxis with desirudin in those patients undergoing elective hip replacement surgery adds, on average, 7 days of life per patient when compared with treatment using enoxaparin. This is equivalent to 1. 91 additional years of life per 100 patients treated. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of prophylaxis with desirudin in patients undergoing elective hip replacement surgery is SEK 24 864 per life-year gained in comparison with enoxaparin. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that prophylactic therapy with desirudin is a cost-effective approach for the prevention of DVT in patients undergoing total hip replacement.

40|$|Introduction: Wipple disease (WD) {{is a rare}} {{chronic disease}} caused by the {{bacillus}} Tropheryma whipplei. Constitutive, rheumatologic, gastrointestinal, cardiac, cerebral, lymphatic, cutaneous, and ophthalmological signs are possible systemic symptoms. However, thrombotic manifestations are rarely described as “stroke-like syndrome” or arterial thrombosis. Diagnosis is based on clinical manifestations and pathological examination. Laboratory findings may include anemia, leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis. Objective: We report a case of venous thrombosis as initial manifestation of WD. Case Report: We describe {{the case of a}} 53 -year-old male with iliofemoral vein thrombosis followed by intermittent diarrhea, loss of appetite, abdominal distension, and bloating. A mild malnutrition state with a weight loss of 13 kg, pallor (+/ 4 +), presence of lower-limb edema (+/ 4 +), and hypertympanic distended abdomen occurred. Laboratory tests on admission revealed anemia, positive inflammatory activity tests, and normal coagulation. Endoscopic examination showed villous edema with white dotted infiltrates in the second duodenal portion and intestinal lymphangiectasia in the terminal ileum. Pathological examination revealed numerous macrophages with positive periodic acid-Schiff inclusions. Venous Doppler ultrasound showed extensive deep thrombosis on the left lower limb and recanalization of the femoral vein in the right lower limb. The patient was treated with ceftriaxone and <b>enoxaparin</b> <b>sodium,</b> which led to an improvement of gastrointestinal and thrombosis symptoms.

Heparin, Ringer's lactate and <b>enoxaparin</b> <b>sodium</b> LS were used as controls. The logarithmic reductions of colony-forming units (CFU) were compared by Student's t-test. After 24 h of exposure, the vancomycin LS did not exert a greater bactericidal effect than the heparin LS control (mean logarithmic reduction: 2. 27 [*]±[*] 0. 58 vs. 1. 34 [*]±[*] 0. 22, respectively, p[*]=[*] 0. 3). The mean logarithmic reduction was greater with daptomycin LS (5. 45 [*]±[*] 0. 14 vs. 0. 39 [*]±[*] 0. 12, p[*]<[*] 0. 01) and ethanol LS (6. 79 [*]±[*] 1. 03 vs. 1. 43 [*]±[*] 0. 54, p[*]=[*] 0. 02).
