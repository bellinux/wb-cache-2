5|$|In 1897, Crowley {{travelled}} to St Petersburg in Russia, later {{claiming that}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> learn Russian {{as he was}} considering a future diplomatic career there. Biographers Richard Spence and Tobias Churton suggested that Crowley had done so as an intelligence agent under the employ of the British secret service, speculating {{that he had been}} enlisted while at Cambridge.|$|E
5|$|Most {{reviews of}} the {{collection}} were positive, applauding how Dalrymple had utilised his experiences to create a work that gives a transparent look at poverty in England. The main detraction that reviewers had for the collection was that Dalrymple often became too opinionated in his writing while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> get across {{the results of his}} experiences.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{came from}} a privileged Anglo-Irish background, Synge's {{writings}} are mainly concerned with the world of the Roman Catholic peasants of rural Ireland and with what he saw as the essential paganism of their world view. Synge developed Hodgkin's disease, a metastatic cancer that was then untreatable. He died several weeks short of his 38th birthday as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> complete his last play, Deirdre of the Sorrows.|$|E
5|$|By {{reaching}} the World Series with the Cardinals, Tony La Russa became the sixth manager to win pennants in both leagues. This was after La Russa had managed the Oakland Athletics to three straight pennants between 1988 and 1990 {{and winning the}} 1989 World Series. He would attempt to join Sparky Anderson as the only men to have managed teams to World Series championships in both leagues. He wore #10 in tribute to Anderson (who wore 10 while manager of the Cincinnati Reds) and to indicate <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> win the team's 10th championship.|$|E

5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{investigate}} the case, learning that Jason {{was taken into}} custody after the bus driver told police that he pushed Menand into the path of his vehicle. However, Jason tells authorities that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> save Menand. The security guard who arrested the old man is found frozen to death after exposure to a chemical refrigerant. Mulder interviews Jason, who explains Menand threatened to go public with a claim that Jason had falsified data on a research paper.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Wilcher {{released}} Heaven-Haven. The {{music was}} performed by The Linden String Quartet. During production of the CD, Wilcher saw press reports about the fatal attack of 18-year-old Sydney resident Thomas Kelly; Wilcher was unable to separate the sorrow he felt for Kelly and his family from the sentiment <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> convey through his music. He eventually dedicated the project to Kelly and announced that proceeds from the album would benefit the Thomas Kelly Youth Foundation.|$|E
5|$|In addition, most {{researchers}} have speculated {{as to why}} Sydney {{was so close to}} an unknown vessel, with various levels of blame assigned to Captain Burnett for the demise of his ship. Theories to explain Burnett's actions include that he was inexperienced or incompetent, deceived by Kormorans disguise, the idea that he was under conflicting orders instructing that raiders be attacked at range but enemy supply ships be captured, or that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> clearly identify the merchantman.|$|E

5|$|Much like Week1 in Chicago {{five years}} back, in Week4 at Seattle, Johnson was {{involved}} in another controversial play. This time, late in the fourth quarter, Seahawks safety Kam Chancellor punched {{the ball out of}} Johnson's hands while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> score a late go-ahead touchdown. Linebacker K. J. Wright then batted the ball out of the end zone for a touchback. The NFL later admitted the referees should have penalized Wright for illegal batting. The Seahawks won the game by a score of 1310.|$|E
5|$|On June 28, 2008, a 17-year-old South Carolina {{teenager}} was decapitated {{after being}} struck by the Batman roller coaster at Six Flags Over Georgia. The teen, who was {{on a trip to}} the park with his church's youth group, scaled two fences with a friend into a restricted area and walked into the ride's path. Although witnesses stated <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> retrieve his hat, a Cobb County police spokesman reported the teens were attempting to take a shortcut into the park.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the scenes}} in Southeast Asia takes place near a karaoke club, and depicts groups of girls, {{apparently}} {{ranging in age from}} early to late teens, offering sexual services to customers. Benjamin Nolot interviews a police officer, who says that the bar's owner recently bought eight other similar clubs and controls around 2,000 girls. Another Southeast Asian scene shows Nolot and his crew chasing an American man out of a town where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> purchase sex with a child.|$|E

5|$|Around 03:00, Hatanaka was {{informed}} by Lieutenant Colonel Masataka Ida that the Eastern District Army {{was on its}} way to the palace to stop him, and that he should give up. Finally, seeing his plan collapsing around him, Hatanaka pleaded with Tatsuhiko Takashima, Chief of Staff of the Eastern District Army, to be given at least ten minutes on the air on NHK radio, to explain to the people of Japan what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> accomplish and why. He was refused. Colonel Haga, commander of the 2ndRegiment of the First Imperial Guards, discovered that the Army did not support this rebellion, and he ordered Hatanaka to leave the palace grounds.|$|E
5|$|Debra, who {{is staying}} at Dexter's apartment, is exercising incessantly and {{barely able to}} sleep as she struggles with {{memories}} of Brian, her ex-fiancé, trying to kill her.

When she takes Rita out to a bar, a man recognizes Debra as the fiancée of the Ice Truck Killer. He touches her on the shoulder and she instinctively punches him in the nose, certain that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> grab her.|$|E
5|$|Eliot {{included}} other literary sources {{within the}} poem: Stéphane Mallarmé, W. B. Yeats, Jonathan Swift, Arnaut Daniel, Nijinsky's dancing in Le Spectre de la Rose, and Shakespeare's Hamlet. Religious images {{were used to}} connect the poem to the writings of Julian of Norwich, to {{the life and death}} of Thomas Wentworth, to William Laud, to Charles I, and to John Milton. Eliot relied on theological statements similar to those of Alfred, Lord Tennyson's In Memoriam and Thomas Hardy's The Impercipient. The Bible also played a large role within the poem, especially in discussions on the Holy Spirit and Pentecost. Many commentators have pointed out the influence of George Herbert within the poem, but Eliot, in a letter to Anne Ridler dated 10 March 1941, stated that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> avoid such connections within Little Gidding.|$|E

5|$|Inon Zur {{was born}} in Israel. At the age of five, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> compose harmonies with his mother's singing, and became {{inspired}} by classical music.

He graduated from the Music Academy of Tel Aviv, and spent four years in the Israeli military. He emigrated to the United States in 1990 to study at the Dick Grove School of Music for a year, and then under private tutor Jack Smalley, a television music composer, and others for two years at the University of California, Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1955, Steiger {{played an}} obnoxious film tycoon, {{loosely based on}} Columbia boss Harry Cohn, {{opposite}} Jack Palance and Ida Lupino in Robert Aldrich's film noir The Big Knife. Steiger bleached his hair for the part, sought inspiration for the role from Russian actor Vladimir Sokoloff, read {{a book about the}} Treblinka extermination camp to understand his character thoroughly, and visited the perfume department of a store in Beverly Hills, California, to try to understand his character's contempt for women. Steiger and Palance did not get along during the production, and in one scene Palance threw several record albums at Steiger in frustration, feeling that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> steal the scene. Steiger earned critical acclaim later that year for a role as a prosecuting major in Otto Preminger's The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell, alongside Gary Cooper and Charles Bickford.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a {{man named}} Father Gregory (Jody Racicot) visits a {{psychiatric}} hospital attempting to visit a girl named Paula Koklos (Perkins), Dara's twin sister. However, he is blocked by Aaron Starkey (Glenn Morshower), a social worker. That night, Paula dies when a man enters her room. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) locates Dara's birth records and reveals {{that she was a}} quadruplet. Shortly thereafter, Starkey reveals that Paula was about to be adopted by Father Gregory. When the agents visit the priest, he insists <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> protect Paula from harm. Later, while examining Paula's body, Scully experiences a vision of her daughter Emily (Lauren Diewold).|$|E
