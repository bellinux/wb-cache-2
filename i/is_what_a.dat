25|$|An {{important}} part of Scouting education is the personal example of the leader. The Scout is impressed by the leader because of his age, his knowledge, and his position as a leader. If the leader is popular, leadership {{will be seen as}} an attractive goal, and the Scout will follow the example of the leader. The Scoutmaster living the Scout law will have more influence than one who simply talks about it.

25|$|Referring to potentiality, this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> {{thing is}} capable of doing, or being acted upon, if the {{conditions}} are right {{and it is not}} prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (dynamei) plant, and if is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either 'act' (poiein) or 'be acted upon' (paschein), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate– being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise– acting).|$|E
25|$|Wilhelm Reich {{commented that}} sex {{education}} {{of his time}} was a work of deception, focusing on biology while concealing excitement-arousal, which <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> pubescent individual is mostly interested in. Reich added that this emphasis obscures what he {{believed to be a}} basic psychological principle: that all worries and difficulties originate from unsatisfied sexual impulses. Leepson asserted that the majority of people favor some sort of sex instruction in public schools, and this has become an intensely controversial issue because, unlike most subjects, sex education is concerned with an especially sensitive and highly personal part of human life. He suggested that sex education should be taught in the classroom.|$|E
25|$|Marshall used Federalist {{approaches}} {{to build a}} strong federal government over the opposition of the Jeffersonian Republicans, who wanted stronger state governments. His influential rulings reshaped American government, making the Supreme Court the final arbiter of constitutional interpretation. The Marshall Court struck down an act of Congress in only one case (Marbury v. Madison in 1803) but that established the Court as a center of power that could overrule the Congress, the President, the states, and all lower courts if that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> fair reading of the Constitution required. He also defended the legal rights of corporations by tying them to the individual rights of the stockholders, thereby ensuring that corporations have {{the same level of}} protection for their property as individuals had, and shielding corporations against intrusive state governments.|$|E

25|$|The {{ideal self}} and real self involve {{understanding}} {{the issues that}} arise from having {{an idea of what}} you wish you were as a person, and having that not match with who you actually are as a person (incongruence). The ideal self <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> person believes should be done, as well as what their core values are. The real self is what is actually played out in life. Through humanistic therapy, an understanding of the present allows clients to add positive experiences to their real self-concept. The goal is to have the two concepts of self become congruent. Rogers believed that only when a therapist was able to be congruent, a real relationship occurs in therapy. It is much easier to trust someone who is willing to share feelings openly, even if it may not be what the client always wants; this allows the therapist to foster a strong relationship.|$|E
25|$|After {{the western}} {{economic}} {{boom of the}} mid-'80s, the younger generation had a decreased influence in fashion as they had less of {{an impact on the}} market.

Thatcherism were promoted in the UK by the British Conservative Party. Leader of the British conservative party, Margaret Thatcher, in her power suit quickly {{became one of the most}} well-known symbol in the 1980s. Suits worn by Margaret Thatcher were usually single color toned with a matching hat, jacket and skirt, that ends below the knee. A wide shoulder cutting and pearl necklace was also part of her regular attire. Her political style was straightforward, effective and sometimes criticized as not empathetic enough.

In particular, he had difficulties with {{the ending of the}} novel, in which Lecter and Starling become lovers: [...] "I couldn't take that quantum leap emotionally on behalf of Starling. Certainly, on behalf of Hannibal—I'm sure that's been {{in the back of his}} mind for a number of years. But for Starling, no. I think one of the attractions about Starling to Hannibal <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> straight arrow she is."

500|$|Jackson {{retired in}} 2006. He spent nearly 45years in the Army but called it [...] "a regret" [...] {{that he never}} fought in a {{conventional}} battle—having been in a staff position in 1982 during the Falklands War and serving as a brigade commander in Northern Ireland during the Gulf War. He said that [...] "Fighting <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> young man with good red blood in his veins joins for. It is the ultimate test for the professional soldier". He has continued to voice opinions on military matters in his retirement. He delivered the annual Richard Dimbleby Lecture four months after leaving the Army. In the lecture, titled The Defence of The Realm in the 21st Century, he criticised the Ministry of Defence and questioned the MoD's understanding of the fundamental ethos of the armed forces. He was critical of the treatment of soldiers, calling some soldiers' accommodation [...] "frankly shaming" [...] and saying that the [...] "Armed Forces' contract with the nation... must be a two-way one", going {{on to say that}} [...] "military operations cost in blood and treasure, because risk-free soldiering, which some seem to think is possible, is simply a contradiction in terms". The MoD responded by saying that [...] "while we do not agree with everything Sir Mike has said, we are always the first to recognise—for example in relation to medical services and accommodation—that although we have delivered real improvements, there is more we can do".|$|E

500|$|Most critics {{reviewed}} [...] "Get Me a Lawyer" [...] positively. The New York Times Alessandra Stanley praised FX {{for choosing}} another series that [...] "keep the light {{focused on the}} dark side of its main characters". Stanley wrote that [...] "Damages is yet another show that requires viewers to tune in to every episode to follow the plot, but it is the most grown-up thriller in the pack [...]" [...] Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that, in the episode, [...] "All the drama is in the writing and the acting." [...] He complimented the [...] "strong cast", stating that [...] "it's Close who makes Damages a series to contend with". Writing for The Age, Robin Oliver called the pilot [...] "terrific-going-on-sensational". She praised Close and Byrne's performances, but also highlighted Danson's role as [...] "a particularly fine piece of casting". Oliver's Age colleague Melinda Houston called Close [...] "delicious – and convincing" [...] as Patty and thought that the script was [...] "fabulous". S. P. Miskowski of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer remarked, [...] "For my money, this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> 'thriller' is all about." [...] TV Squad's Jonathan Toomey enjoyed the episode's flashbacks, saying that the style of the show [...] "works and it works well". Matt Mitovich claimed in a TV Guide recap of the episode, [...] "What a pilot it was!" [...] He praised the acting from Close, Danson and Byrne, while he felt that [...] "the supporting cast is excellent as well". Stuart Levine, writing for Variety, called the pilot his favorite episode of the first season.|$|E
500|$|The main {{themes in}} the album, in Adams words are; [...] "searching for something". The lyrical meaning behind track number four, [...] "Oxygen" [...] <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> person needs in order to survive. In other words, [...] "The person you are with is giving you the air you breathe", and that people in general [...] "need each other 100%." [...] The album's first single, [...] "I Thought I'd Seen Everything" [...] is about keeping an open mind." [...] The theme of [...] "Broken Wings" [...] is about [...] "{{somebody}} who {{taught me how to}} fly", a metaphor which for [...] "putting your trust in somebody who can give you faith and the belief that you can succeed." [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] is based upon the affirmation of life and faith, while [...] "Walk on By" [...] warns the listener of distrustfulness. As with other albums, according to Adams, he likes to end the album with a melancholic song, such as [...] "Something to Believe In" [...] in 11, it's not the last track however. [...] "Flowers Gone Wild" [...] touches on the same theme as two songs he wrote in the early 1980s, [...] "Cover Girl" [...] and [...] "The Best Is Yet To Come", are based upon the murdered playboy bunny Dorothy Stratten. But also people with misplaced emotions and their unfulfilled needs, which are pushed forth by the media, which Adams says, leads people to lose their [...] "sense of decency". Adams explained further; [...] "It's a sort of new love affair with an old story, devouring our celebrities and leaving them when we are done." ...|$|E
500|$|Closing out the year, My Name Is My Name {{was named}} to {{multiple}} [...] "Best Albums of the Year" [...] lists. It was ranked at number 33 on Rolling Stones list of the 50 best albums of 2013. They commented saying, [...] "The cockier half of the Clipse didn't choose to go solo — he had to after his brother found God. Pusha, in turn, found Kanye West, whose stark and twisted production helped make My Name Is My Name feel like a more lyrically focused companion piece to his own Yeezus. It's the year's sharpest hit of street philosophy." [...] Complex named it the third best album of 2013. They elaborated saying, [...] "everything clicks {{because of the way}} it was calculated. The songs benefit from their respective placement beside each other, each track a background for the next. In that way, it brings the Pusha T fan up to speed with what he's evolved into, without leaving them in unfamiliar territory. If you were the reluctant [...] "we want that old Pusha T" [...] fan, then it fed you the teaspoon of updated classic with the medicine of his reinvention—and by the end, you appreciated both sides." [...] Nick Catucci of Entertainment Weekly named it the eighth best album of 2013 saying, [...] "With these beats — private-stash stuff from the likes of his label boss Kanye West and Pharrell Williams — he could sell fire in hell. In fact, Pusha plumbs his emotional depths, breaking down his parents' divorce after 35 years of marriage and his conflicted feelings about his brother." [...] Exclaim! named it the second best hip hop album of 2013. XXL named it the fourth best album of 2013. They commented saying, [...] "Song for song, it's tough to put any album in the same category as Pusha's proper solo debut. In the space of a trim 46 minutes, Push coaxed the best verse of Rick Ross' year on [...] "Hold On," [...] made Kendrick Lamar get dark and grim on [...] "Nosetalgia" [...] and even rapped over a beat that seemed impossible to make into a hip-hop track on [...] "King Push," [...] all while keeping his lyricism at the absolute highest level. The worst song on this album could find its way onto a top ten list. If this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> post-Yeezus world sounds like, sign us up immediately." ...|$|E
