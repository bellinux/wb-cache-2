40|$|In {{this report}} {{the results of}} the cod {{monitoring}} program are presented. This research was commissioned by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs. Cod catches of the vessels in the gear groups BT 2 (beam trawl) and TR (otter trawls and seines) need to be monitored yearly, due to the Dutch implementation of the European cod recovery plan. The European cod recovery plan restricts fishing efforts of European fleets that catch cod. Fishing effort, based on historical track records, is allocated to different gear groups. Fishing effort can be transferred between gear groups but then conversion factors apply. In the Netherlands fishing effort is transferred yearly from the BT 2 <b>gear</b> <b>group</b> to the TR group, based on a national conversion factor of 1 : 3 (BT:TR) kWdays instead of the European conversion factor of 1 : 16, because the cod catches in the Dutch TR fleet are not as high as the European conversion factor implies. In order to substantiate for the national conversion factor, the Dutch government is obliged to report cod catches per unit of effort (CpUE) of the vessels in these gear groups to the European Commission...|$|E

40|$|The Working Group on Spatial Fisheries Data (WGSFD) met at ICES Headquarters, Copenhagen, 10 – 13 June 2014. ICES {{had issued}} two data calls for {{aggregated}} VMS {{data for the}} years 2009 – 2012 : one covering the OSPAR region and one covering the HELCOM region. The group evaluated the data, and used them to answer the ToRs. ICES have produced a document describing ICES Conditions for VMS data use, which {{all members of the}} group signed. The VMS data that ICES received is only to be used for ICES work and after answering the ToRs, the data are to be deleted. The submitted VMS data were aggregated to DCF métier level 6, giving more than 900 unique codes; however some countries only submitted data aggregated to level 4 gear codes. To overcome this discrepancy, it was decided to group the métiers into broader gear categories. For the OSPAR region: Bottom trawls, Dredges, Demersal seines and Beam trawls. For the HELCOM region: Gillnets, Longlines, Bottom trawls and Midwater trawls. As part of the evaluation of the data quality, the aggregated VMS effort data submitted was compared to effort data from the STECF database. These two independent datasets showed similar overall patterns, indicating that the submitted VMS dataset could be used to show the distribution of fishing effort. WGSFD produced a cleaned VMS dataset, aggregated by year and gear groupings, which other ICES EG’s can use. Caveats applying to all the VMS data products and maps in the report were listed. Based on the evaluation of the submitted data, a revised exchange format for aggregated VMS data was suggested. To answer ToR a, DCF indicators 5, 6 and 7 were computed byyear, ICES area (sub-division in the Baltic) and both by <b>gear</b> <b>group</b> and total for all gears. DCF indicator 5 relates to the total area covered by fishing activity, DCF indicator 6 has been calculated as the extent to which fishing activities are aggregated, and DCF indicator 7, the total area not impacted by fishing activities, was calculated by subtracting DCF indicator 5 fishing area from the area of the ICES area/subdivision. All the DCF indicators have been expressed both as area and proportions of the total area. In ToR a, WGSFD was also requested to contribute to ICES work on MSFD descriptor 6. The group produced a cleaned dataset, aggregated by year and <b>gear</b> <b>group,</b> which other ICES EG’s can use to relate fishing pressure to potential impact on underlying habitats. The following example outputs were produced: 1. Map of mean fishing effort in number of hours per km 2. 2. Map of increase/decrease in fishing effort over the years analysed. 3. Map of number of years a c-square has been impacted, with different thresholds. For ToR b, WGSFD responded to requests from other ICES EG’s: Requests from WGBFAS and WGNSSK related to fishing effort, a request from WGMPCZM and a request from ADGVME regarding use of AIS data. For ToR c on reviewing ongoing work for analysing VMS data, WGSFD were updated on: • the ongoing work in the BENTHIS project; • a method developed by JNCC for estimating benthic abrasion caused by human activities; • a nested grids method for calculating the area of the seabed impacted by fishing gear; • the bias and variance of estimates of fishing effort from VMS data; • production of an Atlas of Commercial Fisheries around Ireland. ToR d was a request from OSPAR to propose and apply a method to map mobile bottom contact fishing intensity and to prepare a first OSPAR-wide map of the spatial and temporal intensity of mobile bottom-contact fishing activities. The co-lead of the ICG-COBAM benthic expert group was present at the meeting to provide information both on the purpose of the data call and how the products were to be analysed. The group performed an initial evaluation of whether the data submitted served the purpose of the OSPAR request, and based on this work, WGSFD proposed a revised exchange format for future data calls for aggregated VMS data. Maps for the OSPAR region showing VMS effort by year and <b>gear</b> <b>group</b> were produced as well as a map showing the gear composition in the area and an example map applying the abrasion methodology giving maps of surface and sub-surface bottom contact...|$|E
40|$|This study {{assesses the}} seabed {{pressure}} of towed fishing gears and models the physical impact (area {{and depth of}} seabed penetration) from trip-based information of vessel size, gear type, and catch. Traditionally fishing pressures are calculated top-down by making use of large-scale statistics such as logbook data. Here, we take a different approach starting from the gear itself (design and dimensions) to estimate the physical interactions with the seabed {{at the level of}} the individual fishing operation. We defined 14 distinct towed gear groups in European waters (eight otter trawl groups, three beam trawl groups, two demersal seine groups, and one dredge group), for which we established gear “footprints”. The footprint of a gear is defined as the relative contribution from individual larger gear components, such as trawl doors, sweeps, and groundgear, to the total area and severity of the gear's impact. An industry-based survey covering 13 countries provided the basis for estimating the relative impact-area contributions from individual gear components, whereas sediment penetration was estimated based on a literature review. For each <b>gear</b> <b>group,</b> a vessel size–gear size relationship was estimated to enable the prediction of gear footprint area and sediment penetration from vessel size. Application of these relationships with average vessel sizes and towing speeds provided hourly swept-area estimates by métier. Scottish seining has the largest overall gear footprint of ~ 1. 6 km 2 h - 1 of which 0. 08 km 2 has an impact at the subsurface level (sediment penetration = 2 cm). Beam trawling for flatfish ranks low when comparing overall footprint size/hour but ranks substantially higher when comparing only impact at the subsurface level (0. 19 km 2 h - 1). These results have substantial implications for the definition, estimation, and monitoring of fishing pressure indicators, which are discussed in the context of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 Concern {{over the}} {{incidental}} catch of non-targeted species in commercial and recreational fisheries has greatly increased. Public attention, negative publicity, controversies between differing fisheries and <b>gear</b> <b>groups</b> and the reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act {{have led to}} an increased awareness of the issue. The Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis) is a valuable fish in several commercial and recreational fisheries of the northeastern Pacific Ocean. There is growing concern over the incidental catch of halibut in fisheries targeting other species. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife {{in cooperation with the}} Oregon Trawl Commission, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the International Pacific Halibut Commission and the commercial fishing industry have prepared a video on avoiding halibut bycatch and reducing the discard mortality of incidentally caught halibut. Approximately 575 copies of this video were distributed to commercial shrimp and groundfish permit holders in Oregon and Washington. ODFW would like to evaluate the video and its distribution to try to determine if it was an effective tool in reducing halibut bycatch and mortality.

40|$|The {{management}} of multi-species fisheries is usually challenging {{because of the}} high number of fleets and gears targeting numerous species. In recent times, the concept of metiers has been used to enable further understanding of spatio-temporal variation of species and behaviour of fishers. In the present study, an output-based approach (i. e. the use of landing data) was used to identify potential metiers in the artisanal fisheries of the Central region of Ghana. The landing data was over a five-year period – 2004 - 2008 and based on species caught by five main gears, namely Ali-Poli-Watsa (a type of purse seine net), beach seine, drift gill net, hook and line and set net gears. Multivariate analyses, namely Canonical Correspondence Analysis, Redundancy Analysis (RDA) and Generalized Additive Models (GAM) – were used to analyze catch per unit effort (CPUE) and revenue per unit effort (RPUE) on yearly and monthly basis respectively. The environmental variables used in the multivariate analyses were gear, year, month and temperature. It was observed that changes in catch and revenue rates followed seasonal patterns, with some gears recording their maximum revenue rates in the second semester of the year. Initially, three major <b>gear</b> <b>groups</b> were identified. Subsequent analyses led to the generation of two models – prey-gear niche and niche timeline – to further explain the interactions of the various gears across months and the implications of these to fisheries management was discussed. The results from the multivariate analyses were supplemented with data obtained from interviews of fishers in Winneba fishing community. It was observed that even though fishers had high fidelity to particular gears during fishing seasons, they sometimes diversified their target species. Lack of an alternative occupation to fishers threaten their livelihoods, thus it was recommended that fisheries managers or scientists explore ways of enhancing the resilience of fishers...|$|R
