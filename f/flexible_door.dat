2500|$|The H-21C saw {{extensive}} {{service with}} the U.S. Army, primarily {{for use in}} transporting troops and supplies. On 24 August 1954, {{with the assistance of}} inflight refueling provided by a U.S. Army U-1A Otter, a H-21C known as Amblin' Annie became the first helicopter to cross the United States nonstop. Various experiments were made by the Army in arming the H-21C as a gunship; some Shawnees were armed with flex guns under the nose, while others were fitted with door guns. One experimental version was tested stateside with a Boeing B-29 Superfortress [...]50 cal. remote turret mounted beneath the nose. The H-21C (later designated CH-21C) was first deployed to Vietnam in December 1961 with the Army's 8th and 57th Transportation Companies, in support of Army of the Republic of Vietnam troops. In Army service, the CH-21C Shawnee could be armed with 7.62mm (.308 in) or 12.7mm (.50 in) <b>flexible</b> <b>door</b> guns. Relatively slow, the CH-21's unprotected control cables and fuel lines proved vulnerable to the enhanced threat posed by North Vietnamese Army and Vietcong ground forces, which were increasingly well supplied with automatic small arms and heavy (12.7mm) AA machine guns. The H-21, which was designed for cold weather operations, performed poorly in the hot weather of Vietnam. Despite being capable of carrying 20 passengers, it carried only nine when operating in Vietnam. The shooting down of a CH-21 Shawnee near the Laotian-Vietnamese border with the death of four aviators in July 1962 were some of the U.S. Army's earliest Vietnam casualties. Despite these events, the Shawnee continued in service as the U.S. Army's helicopter workhorse in Vietnam until 1964 when it was replaced with the Bell UH-1 Huey. In 1965, the Boeing CH-47 Chinook was deployed to Vietnam, and later that year, most CH-21 helicopters were withdrawn from active inventory in the U.S. Army and Air Force.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the war had}} impeded Day’s {{ambition}} to become a furniture designer, his fortunes changed in 1948 when he and Clive Latimer won First Prize in the Storage Section of the International Competition for Low-Cost Furniture Design organised by the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Their ingenious concept {{for a range of}} multi-purpose storage units fabricated from a tube of pre-formed moulded plywood received international acclaim. Although never mass-produced, a set of prototypes made by Heal & Son in 1949 demonstrated the principles behind the design. Supported on tubular aluminium legs, the cabinets were compact and <b>flexible,</b> with sliding <b>doors,</b> interchangeable shelf and drawer fittings and a writing desk with a drop-down flap.|$|R
40|$|Up to {{now there}} are few {{examples}} of highly porous fibers, which have advanta-geous properties. Still nano-porous fibers for textile-relevant applications have not been synthesized successfully. Sol-gel analogous syntheses routes as well as production ways for cellulose aerogel fibers have been worked out. Under-standing how processes work and how structures influence properties has been achieved. Methods related to textile technology, machine engineering, chemical knowledge and material science have been combined to work out cellulose aer-ogel multifilament fibers, which show textile relevant properties including fila-ment diameters smaller than 30 µm, filament strengths in the dimension of wool fibers (up to 15 cN/tex) and specific surfaces up to 500 m 2 /g. Machines and pro-cess sub-steps, such as ion-exchange and solid-phase-extraction procedures have been developed.

40|$|The paper {{begins with}} an {{elementary}} treatment of a standard trammel (trammel of Archimedes), a line segment of fixed length whose ends slide along two perpendicular axes. During the motion, points on the trammel trace ellipses, and the trammel produces an astroid as an envelope that is also the envelope {{of the family of}} traced ellipses. Two generalizations are introduced: a zigzag trammel, obtained by dividing a standard trammel into several hinged pieces, and a flexible trammel whose length may vary during the motion. All properties regarding traces and envelopes of a standard trammel are extended to these more general trammels. Applications of zigzag trammels are given to problems involving folding <b>doors.</b> <b>Flexible</b> trammels provide not only {{a deeper understanding of the}} standard trammel but also a new solution of a classical problem of determining the envelope of a family of straight lines. They also reveal unexpected connections between various classical curves; for example, the cycloid and the quadratrix of Hippias, curves known from antiquity...|$|R
30|$|Generally, {{rail freight}} {{transport}} is utilised by customers to move low value high volume cargo such as coal (e.g. for power plants), steel (e.g. for ship manufacturing), and other raw materials for industrial input. In recent decades, there have been {{major changes in the}} composition of the cargo, so that now semi-finished products (e.g. car parts for assembly) and finished products (value added through final process) present the greatest demand for transport in Europe [1, 2]. This type of cargo is typically lower density and higher value (LDHV) and requires faster and more reliable transportation. Currently, LDHV goods are predominantly transported by road transport. Aside from faster and more reliable services, road hauliers also offer a <b>flexible,</b> customer tailored, <b>door</b> to-door service. In contrast, {{rail freight transport}} is typically slower door to door and in many cases unreliable [3]. This may in part be attributed to lower priority in timetable path allocation, compared to national and international passenger rail services [4]. The average transport haul is also shorter in Europe, which favours road transport – the EC currently considers 300  km to be the distance at which rail becomes economically competitive with road transport.|$|R
40|$|One {{dominant}} “wind noise” generating {{mechanism in}} road vehicles is {{the interaction between}} turbulent flows and <b>flexible</b> structures: specifically <b>door</b> seals and side glass windows. In this study, the effects of seal mechanical properties on interior aerodynamic noise were investigated. ^ The sound transmission characteristics of seals were first investigated. The vibration response together with the radiated sound power was computed using FE-analysis. Experimental data obtained for several seal specimens using reverberation room test methods {{was used in the}} validation of numerical models. The developed tools were used to compare sound transmission characteristics of seals made of EPDM and TPE. The validated numerical model was then utilized to investigate the influence of various design parameters on the sound transmission characteristics of seals. It was found that any unconstrained structural coupling between seal walls should be avoided to minimize sound transmission. ^ The sound radiated by a seal-supported, rectangular plate excited by turbulent flows was then investigated. The primary goal was to assess the influence of support properties on the noise generated from the plate. The flow-induced vibration of the plate was calculated using the Corcos model for the surface pressure loading and an assumed-modes method. The results showed that support tuning can yield significant reduction in vibration amplitudes for a fixed excitation amplitude. Two different methods to calculate the optimal support stiffness were developed. The first model, based on a one-dimensional transverse wave assumption, yielded a good first cut approximation of the optimal properties. The second model, based on the assumed-modes method, yielded more accurate estimations. The optimal support stiffnesses calculated from the two different methods were in close agreement. ^ Finally, experimental techniques to measure viscoelastic properties of foamed elastomers at high frequencies were developed and applied to measure mechanical properties of seal materials. The measurements were performed for foams with various void fractions, from which the relationship between the void fraction and the dynamic moduli was measured. The measurement results were compared to the predictions from several different micromechanics models. The results can be used to determine optimal seal mechanical properties that minimize the aerodynamic noise. ...|$|R
