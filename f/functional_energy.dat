50|$|The {{concept of}} entropy {{developed}} {{in response to}} the observation that a certain amount of <b>functional</b> <b>energy</b> released from combustion reactions is always lost to dissipation or friction and is thus not transformed into useful work. Early heat-powered engines such as Thomas Savery's (1698), the Newcomen engine (1712) and the Cugnot steam tricycle (1769) were inefficient, converting less than two percent of the input energy into useful work output; a great deal of useful energy was dissipated or lost. Over the next two centuries, physicists investigated this puzzle of lost energy; the result was the concept of entropy.|$|E
50|$|Similar {{to western}} medical practitioners, Japanese {{physicians}} and medical therapists use the abdomen (hara) in diagnosis {{to determine the}} health or otherwise of the patient, particularly, but not exclusively, {{the state of the}} abdominal organs or tissues and the related energy fields. While in western medicine the palpation of the abdomen (abdominal examination) is aimed at the physical organs palpable in that area to assess their size, shape, consistency, reaction to pressure and such, in eastern medicine the Hara is seen as an area that reflects the state of all the organs (physically palpable in the abdomen or not), their energetic as well as their physical state, and their complex functional relationships with each other. In diagnosis and treatment, the Hara is partitioned in areas, each of which is considered - on the basis of empirical evidence - to represent one of the (ten, eleven or twelve) vital organs AND their <b>functional</b> <b>energy</b> fields. The details of this basic model of Hara diagnosis may differ from school to school, depending on which underlying philosophical, physiological, pathological or therapeutic model of Japanese or Chinese medicine is being used (e.g. Five Elements, Five Phases, Yin and Yang, Zang Fu or Meridian theory), but the underlying principles remain the same.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{commonly}} used stretchable energy storage device {{is based on}} active materials for double-layer supercapacitors are carbon-based materials such as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs),due to their excellent electrical conductivity and high surface areas. The carbon-based materials are also natural choices for stretchable supercapacitors, with proper structural engineering to impart stretchability to the devices. Most recent study by Li et al. shows the fully functionality of the stretchable supercapacitor under dynamic charging and discharging, for the first time, which is composed of both elastic PDMS substrates, buckled SWCNTs macrofilm and elastomeric separators. Although achieving excellent cycling stability, however, the key drawback of this stretchable energy storage based on supercapacitor technology is the low specific capacitance and energy density and this can potentially be improved by the incorporation of redox materials, for example the SWNT/MnO2 electrode. Another approach to creating stretchable energy storage device {{is the use of}} Origami folding principle. The resulting origami battery achieves significant linear and areal deformability, large twistability and bendability. The strategy described here represents the fusion of the art of origami, materials science and <b>functional</b> <b>energy</b> storage devices, and could provide a paradigm shift for architecture and design of flexible and curvilinear electronics with exceptional mechanical characteristics and functionalities ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Many vision {{problems}} can be formulated as minimization of appropriate <b>energy</b> <b>functionals.</b> These <b>energy</b> <b>functionals</b> are usually minimized, based on the calculus of variations (Euler-Lagrange equation). Once the Euler-Lagrange equation has been determined {{it needs to be}} discretized in order to implement it on a digital computer. This is not a trivial task and, moreover, error-prone. In this article, we propose a flexible alternative. We discretize the <b>energy</b> <b>functional</b> and subsequently apply the mathematical concept of algorithmic differentiation to directly derive algorithms that implement the <b>energy</b> <b>functional’s</b> derivatives. This approach has several advantages: First, the computed derivatives are exact with respect to the implementation of the <b>energy</b> <b>functional.</b> Second, it is basically straightforward to compute second-order derivatives and thus the Hessian matrix of the <b>energy</b> <b>functional.</b> Third, algorithmic differentiation is a process which can be automated. We demonstrate this novel approach on three representative vision problems (namely denoising, segmentation, and stereo) and show that state-of-the-art results are obtained with little effort.

5000|$|ConsERV, {{a product}} {{developed}} by the Dais Analytic Corporation, uses nanoscale polymer membranes {{to increase the efficiency}} of heating and cooling systems and has already proven to be a lucrative design. The polymer membrane was specifically configured for this application by selectively engineering the size of the pores in the membrane to prevent air from passing, while allowing moisture to pass through the membrane. ConsERV's value is demonstrated {{in the form of an}} energy recovery a device which pretreats the incoming fresh air to a building using the energy found in the exhaust air steam using no moving parts to lower the energy and carbon footprint of existing forms of heating and cooling equipment Polymer membranes can be designed to selectively allow particles of one size and shape to pass through while preventing other. This makes for a powerful tool that can be used in all markets - consumer, commercial, industrial, and government products from biological weapons protection to industrial chemical separations. Dais's near term uses of this 'family' of selectively engineered nanotechnology materials, aside from ConsERV, include (a.) a completely new cooling cycle capable of replacing the refrigerant based cooling cycle the world has known for the past 100 plus years. This product, under development, is named NanoAir. NanoAir uses only water and this selectively engineered membrane material to cool (or heat) and dehumidify (or humidify) air. There are no fluorocarbon producing gasses used, and the energy required to cool a space drops as thermodynamics does the actual cooling. The company was awarded an Advanced Research Program Administration - Energy award in 2010, and a United States Department of Defense (DoD) grant in 2011 both designed to accelerate this newer, energy efficient technology closer to commercialization, and (b.) a novel way to clean most all contaminated forms of water called NanoClear. By using the selectivity of this hermetic, engineered composite material it can transfer only a water molecule from one face of the membrane to the other leaving behind the contaminants. It should also be noted Dais received a US Patent (Patent Number 7,990,679) in October 2011 titled [...] "Nanoparticle Ultracapacitor". This patented item again uses the selectively engineered material to create an energy storage mechanism projected to have performance and cost advantages over existing storage technologies. The company has used this patent's concepts to create a <b>functional</b> <b>energy</b> storage prototype device named NanoCap. NanoCap is a form of ultra-capacitor potentially useful to power a broad range of applications including most forms of transportation, energy storage (especially useful as a storage media for renewable energy technologies), telecommunication infrastructure, transistor gate dielectrics, and consumer battery applications (cell phones, computers, etc.).|$|E
