25|$|ASU is also {{involved}} with NASA {{in the field}} of space exploration. To meet the needs of NASA programs, ASU built the LEED Gold Certified, 298,000-square-foot Interdisciplinary Science and Technology Building IV (ISTB 4) at a cost of $110million in 2012. The building includes space for the School of Earth and Space Exploration (SESE) and includes labs and other facilities for the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering. One of the main projects at ISTB 4 includes the OSIRIS-REx Thermal <b>Emission</b> <b>Spectrometer</b> (OTES). Although ASU built the spectrometers aboard the Martian rovers Spirit and Opportunity, OTES will be the first major scientific instrument completely designed and built at ASU for a NASA space mission. Phil Christensen, the principal investigator for the Mars Global Surveyor Thermal <b>Emission</b> <b>Spectrometer</b> (TES), is a Regents' Professor at ASU. He also serves as the principal investigator for the Mars Odyssey THEMIS instruments, as well as co-investigator for the Mars Exploration Rovers. ASU scientists are responsible for the Mini-TES instruments aboard the Mars Exploration Rovers. The Center for Meteorite Studies, which is home to rare Martian meteorites and exotic fragments from space, and the Mars Space Flight Facility are on ASU's Tempe campus.|$|E

Most of our current knowledge about the mineral composition of Mars comes from spectroscopic data from orbiting spacecraft, in situ analyses of rocks and soils from six landing sites, and study of the Martian meteorites. Spectrometers currently in orbit include THEMIS (Mars Odyssey), OMEGA (Mars Express), and CRISM (Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter).

Surface Type 2 (ST2) is common in the younger plains north of the dichotomy boundary and is more silica rich than ST1. [...] The lavas of ST2 have been interpreted as andesites or basaltic andesites, indicating the lavas in the northern plains originated from more chemically evolved, volatile-rich magmas.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Routine spectrochemical {{analysis}} of used oil samples with rotating disc electrode (RDE) or {{inductively coupled plasma}} (ICP) <b>emission</b> <b>spectrometers</b> has become standard practice in machine condition monitoring programs to determine elemental content. Unfortunately, both of these techniques become less responsive to particles as they increase in size. To overcome this limitation, several complementary methods and analytical techniques to detect large particles in used oil have been applied, including acid digestion, ferrography, and X-ray analysis. Unfortunately, these techniques are not practical or economical to implement in a high sample throughput machine condition-monitoring program. One technique that has demonstrated success as a complementary method for detecting large particles is rotrode filter spectroscopy (RFS). RFS extends the capability of rotating disc electrode (RDE) spectrometers to detect particles greater than 10 µm in size...|$|R
