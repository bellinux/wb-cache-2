5|$|Meanwhile, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) becomes Jack's office assistant, {{replacing}} {{his former}} assistant Jonathan (Maulik Pancholy). Kenneth asks Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{to feed his}} bird, as he is busy with two jobs now. Kenneth asks Tracy not to enter his bedroom, a request that makes Tracy curious. Believing Kenneth might be a serial killer, he tells Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and they decide to investigate Kenneth's bedroom. At Kenneth's apartment, they discover a bug bomb in his room, and reaching the conclusion that Kenneth is trying to poison them and they run out of his apartment. They <b>forget</b> <b>to</b> close {{the door and the}} bug bomb ends up killing the bird. When they tell Kenneth about his bird, he is more upset by the fact that Tracy and Jenna did not trust him, than the death of his bird. Tracy and Jenna, feeling horrible about what they have done, arrange a surprise for Kenneth at his apartment. When Kenneth goes home, he finds an entire collection of birds.|$|E
5|$|Peter, Cleveland, Joe, and Quagmire are {{spending}} the evening at The Drunken Clam, when Peter is reminded {{to pick up}} Meg from the roller skating rink. They {{then go to the}} rink and continue to enjoy themselves, but <b>forget</b> <b>to</b> pick up Meg when they leave. After skating home in the rain, Meg asks the family for her own car. The next day, Peter takes his daughter to the local car showroom, where she shows an interest in a sedan. Distracted by a large tank at the dealership, however, Peter is tricked into buying it. At first, Peter uses the tank himself, despite it being intended for Meg, but then he teaches Meg to drive it. Later that day, however, the two accidentally run over Joe, and he impounds the tank. Frustrated, Meg decides to earn the money for her own car, and is able to get a job at the local Quahog mega store, Superstore USA, working under a man named Mr. Penisburg. The shops in Quahog soon become bankrupt because of the new superstore, and causes people to lose their jobs of Superstore USA's one job taking quahog, like cleveland and mort putting planks on the doors so they will become abandoned.|$|E

To make matters worse, a sunburned dragon has run off with the Princess Croak and the spell cabinet has been knocked over spreading the spells everywhere.|$|R

25|$|A mum {{just like}} any other, apart {{from the fact that}} she drives a tank. In one skit she drops her son and {{daughter}} off at primary school. They <b>forget</b> <b>to</b> take their lunches with them and the mum shoots it at them with the tank's cannon.|$|E
25|$|Statement {{measures}} tend {{to comprise}} more words than lexical measures, so hence consume more research instrument space and more respondent time to complete. Respondents are asked {{the extent to}} which they, for example, Often <b>forget</b> <b>to</b> put things back in their proper place, or Am careful to avoid making mistakes. Some statement-based measures of conscientiousness have similarly acceptable psychometric properties in North American populations to lexical measures, but their generally emic development makes them less suited to use in other populations. For instance, statements in colloquial North American English like Often <b>forget</b> <b>to</b> put things back in their proper place or Am careful to avoid making mistakes can be hard for non-native English-speakers to understand, suggesting internationally validated measures might be more appropriate for research conducted with non-North Americans.|$|E

25|$|Patients {{with early}} Parkinson's disease suffer {{a large enough}} amount of {{prospective}} memory impairment to be affected in everyday life. These patients show impairment {{in the use of}} internal attentional strategies which are required for intention retrieval. Parkinson's disease leads to poorer performance on time-based but not event-based prospective memory tasks. For example, patients may <b>forget</b> <b>to</b> take medication at certain times of the day, but forgetting is less likely if they see the medicine bottle.|$|E
25|$|The Urapmin have {{replaced}} traditional rituals with new, Christian methods for removing sin (Tok Pisin: sin, Urapmin yum, lit. debt). The Urapmin have innovated {{an institution of}} confession (Tok Pisin: autim sin), which was not present in the Baptist Church which they belong to. Confessions are held {{at least once a}} month, and some Urapmin keep lists of sins in order not to <b>forget</b> <b>to</b> confess them. Pastors and other leaders regularly give haranguing lectures (Urapmin: weng kem) about avoiding sin.|$|E
25|$|This done, the shepherds and shepherdesses made merry {{with these}} cakes and fine grapes, and sported {{themselves}} {{together at the}} sound of the pretty small pipe, scoffing and laughing at those vainglorious cake-bakers, who had that day met with a mischief for want of crossing themselves with a good hand in the morning. Nor did they <b>forget</b> <b>to</b> apply to Forgier's leg some fat chenin grapes, and so handsomely dressed it and bound it up that he was quickly cured.|$|E

25|$|Dashashwamedh Ghat. It is {{situated}} {{on the bank of}} river Narmada near Dandia Bazar. This is the place where King Mahabali performed ten ashwamedha sacrifices. It is at this place where Lord Vishnu came in the disguise of Vamana and measured the whole universe with his three steps. There are many old temples constructed on this ghat which includes Ambaji Mata Temple, Umiya Mata Temple, Narmada Mata Temple, Kotirudreshwar Mahadev, Vamana Temple and many others. One must not <b>forget</b> <b>to</b> visit this ghat at early morning hours to enjoy the spiritual peace of this place.|$|E
25|$|Their {{first stop}} is a French-controlled castle. One of the {{soldiers}} tells the knights that they already have a grail, then taunts them with ridiculous insults. After a failed invasion of the castle, with the French soldiers throwing animals at them, the knights try sneaking into the castle in a Trojan Rabbit, but they <b>forget</b> <b>to</b> hide inside it. The rabbit is catapulted at them and crushes one of the knights' servants. Arthur decides the group should break into smaller groups to seek the Grail. A modern-day historian, describing the Arthurian legends, is abruptly killed by a knight on horseback, triggering a police investigation.|$|E
25|$|Health psychologists {{engage in}} {{research}} and practice aimed at getting people to follow medical advice and adhere to their treatment regimens. Patients often <b>forget</b> <b>to</b> take their pills or consciously opt not to take their prescribed medications because of side effects. Failing to take prescribed medication is costly and wastes millions of usable medicines that could otherwise help other people. Estimated adherence rates are difficult to measure (see below); there is, however, evidence that adherence could be improved by tailoring treatment programs to individuals' daily lives. Additionally, traditional cognitive-behavioural therapies have been adapted for people suffering from chronic illnesses and comorbid psychological distress to include modules that encourage, support and reinforce adherence to medical advice {{as part of the}} larger treatment approach.|$|E

25|$|In November 2013, Jawbone {{announced}} the UP24 and a software update. With similar dimensions to the UP, UP24 features {{the ability to}} sync wirelessly via Bluetooth to the updated app. UP24 has as a 7-day battery life (depending on use) and the previous 3.5mm connector {{was replaced by a}} 2.5mm connector. The software provided more real-time information to help motivate users. The app also suggests goals based on user's habits. Live notifications are provided on the UP24 so users will get push notifications when they get close to their goals. A new activity log gives a snapshot of a user's day and when the UP24 last synced. The 3.0 app also will automatically analyze sleep data from the previous night if users <b>forget</b> <b>to</b> press the button for sleep mode, and lets users edit sleep/wake times.|$|E
25|$|Beginners {{often make}} the mistake of not {{relaxing}} the arm during the recovery and of moving the hand too high and too far away from the body, in some cases even higher than the elbow. In these cases, drag and incidental muscle effort is increased at the expense of speed. Beginners often <b>forget</b> <b>to</b> use their shoulders to let the hand enter as far forward as possible. Some say the hand should enter the water thumb first, reducing drag through possible turbulence, others say the middle finger is first with the hand precisely bent down, giving thrust right from the start. At the beginning of the pull, the hand acts like a wing and is moved slower than the swimmer while at the end it acts like an oar and is moved faster than the swimmer.|$|E
25|$|A {{well trained}} soldier could fire {{up to three}} rounds per minute, {{and the use of}} the platoon {{formation}} by the British army meant that a constant volley of fire could be employed. There was much that could go wrong with the musket– from misfires in wet weather, to the gun firing at random due to sparks which set the powder off. In the heat of battle a soldier may <b>forget</b> <b>to</b> remove the ramrod from the barrel before firing. Nonetheless, the musket proved to be an overall reliable weapon which's performance, especially when used en masse, should not be underestimated. Even though contemporary writers often state that a musket's effective range when firing at an individual target did not go beyond 30 paces, modern test firings at individual human-sized targets suggest that a musket's effective range lies somewhere between 70 and 100 yards.|$|E

25|$|Card users {{sometimes}} <b>forget</b> <b>to</b> touch in or touch out, {{are unable}} to find the yellow readers {{or it may be}} too crowded to touch out. Such card users have either received penalty fares by revenue inspectors, been charged a maximum cash fare, or been prosecuted in courts which can issue high penalties. Card users are also penalised for touching {{in and out of the}} same station within a two-minute period. The system applies two penalty fares (one for touching in, and one for touching out) to passengers who touch in, wait more than twenty minutes for a train, but {{are unable to}} travel because there are no trains, baulk at the waiting, and touch out. This is because the system assumes that, after such a long delay, the passenger has traveled to another station where they have failed to touch out and failed to touch in, thus resulting in two penalty fares.|$|E
25|$|Granville {{heritage}} is rich of numerous religious buildings including the , The ancient church of Notre-Dame du Cap Lihou (1441–1796) it dominates the heights, constitutes an imposing granite {{building of the}} Romanesque / early Gothic style. It was built by the English during the Hundred Years' War. The choir is of 1641, the nave of 1655, the apse chapels in 1676 and 1688, and the sacristy is of 1771, a listed historical monument since 1930, it is decorated with stained glass by Jacques Le Chevallier. As well as a thirteenth-century miraculous statue of Mary, visitors should note, on the eighteenth-century façade, the quatrain:Si l'amour de MarieEst en ton cœur gravéEn passant ne t'oublieDe lui dire un Ave. (If the love of Mary is engraved on your heart, when passing do not <b>forget</b> <b>to</b> say Hail to her). The same verses are to {{be seen on the}} façade of Notre-Dame de Bon-Secours in Montréal. There is also St. Paul's Church, the St. Nicholas Church and the Protestant temple.|$|E
25|$|In February 2010, the HPA ran {{a massive}} fundraiser {{to support those}} in dire need after the tragic event of the Haiti earthquake. Live webcasts were held in which celebrities (especially those {{a part of the}} Harry Potter Fandom) {{performed}} and encouraged viewers to donate money. Donations came through an auction that did not guarantee you the prize. Some items that were up for bid were: a signed set of the Harry Potter books, a guitar signed by actor Tom Felton, handmade earrings from actress Evanna Lynch, and a one thousand word story about whatever the winner wishes it to be written by Maureen Johnson and John Green. The webcasts were rather successful, garnering over $125,000. The original plan of Helping Haiti Heal was to have three plane fulls of aid (each one dubbed: Harry, Hermione, and Ron) shipped off to Haiti. As of June the same year, five planes were sent to Haiti, Harry, Hermione, Ron, DFTBA (Don't <b>Forget</b> <b>To</b> Be Awesome) and the last being Dumbledore. On 28 June, there was a livestream video celebrating the landing of Dumbledore. Evanna Lynch was present at the stream and even answered questions asked by fans. Ophelia Dahl, the daughter of the late British author Roald Dahl was also present since she worked with Partners in Health, who the Harry Potter Alliance teamed up with for Helping Haiti Heal.|$|E
