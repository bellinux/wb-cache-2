25|$|Collaboration systems {{utilizing}} Operational Transformations typically use replicated <b>document</b> <b>storage,</b> {{where each}} client {{has their own}} copy of the document; clients operate on their local copies in a lock-free, non-blocking manner, and the changes are then propagated {{to the rest of}} the clients; this ensures the client high responsiveness in an otherwise high-latency environment such as the Internet. When a client receives the changes propagated from another client, it typically transforms the changes before executing them; the transformation ensures that application-dependent consistency criteria (invariants) are maintained by all sites. This mode of operation results in a system particularly suited for implementing collaboration features, like simultaneous document editing, in a high-latency environment such as the web.|$|E

The new Executive Director, Kelvyn Anderson, stated that the [...] "nondisclosure {{agreement}} that the 2008 Police Advisory Commission entered into with the DA undermines our effectiveness and credibility as a civilian oversight board and compromises the openness and transparency that is our raison d’être.” Calling [...] "the magnitude of mismanagement of the Nizah Morris homicide [...] staggering," [...] Anderson sent a letter requesting a full investigation from U.S. Attorney Zane Memenger. The letter cites that the Philadelphia Police Department investigation was a [...] "litany of errors" [...] including procedural errors in policing, hospital errors, handling intoxicated persons, record keeping, logging information, <b>document</b> <b>storage,</b> hiding communications, [...] "off-the-record" [...] communiques, missing evidence, and testimony so inconsistent {{to rise to the}} level of perjury.|$|E
2500|$|The Palace of Westminster {{as a whole}} {{began to}} see {{significant}} alterations from the 18th century onwards, as Parliament struggled {{to carry out its}} business in the limited available space and ageing buildings. Calls for an entirely new palace went unheeded as instead more buildings of varying quality and style were added. A new west façade, known as the Stone Building, facing onto St Margaret's Street was designed by John Vardy built in the Palladian style between 1755 and 1770, providing more space for <b>document</b> <b>storage</b> and committee rooms. The House of Commons Engrossing Office of Robert Gunnell (1724-1794) and Edward Barwell was on the lower floor beside the corner tower at the west side of Vardy's western façade. A new official residence for the Speaker of the House of Commons was built adjoining St Stephen's Chapel and completed in 1795. The neo-Gothic architect James Wyatt also carried out works on both the House of Lords and Commons between 1799 and 1801, including alterations to the exterior of St Stephen's Chapel and a much-derided new neo-Gothic building, referred to by Wyatt's critics as [...] "The Cotton Mill" [...] adjoining the House of Lords and facing onto Old Palace Yard.|$|E

50|$|Many {{institutions}} maintain {{archives of}} their important documents. Documentation {{pertaining to the}} institution itself, as well as collections documentation is stored in the institutional archive or the library. Sometimes paper copies of collections files are stored offsite for extra safety and security (and for space considerations). An archive of collections information can have its own collecting policy and arrangement, unrelated to the way documents are organized in the current collections files. It {{is up to the}} Archivist to decide how to preserve and organize this collection of <b>documents.</b> <b>Storage</b> requirements for the various types of files in an archive (paper records, photographic material, electronic media, magnetic tape, etc.) are critical to the long-term preservation of the materials.|$|R

40|$|XML {{documents}} {{management is}} becoming an area of great research value and interest, since XML has become a popular standard for data communication and knowledge exchange over the Internet. Therefore, new issues have emerged in terms of storage and access control policies for XML <b>documents.</b> Concerning the <b>storage</b> issues, the majority of proposals rely on the usage of typical database management systems (DBMSs) whereas, XML documents can also be stored in other storage environments (such as file systems and LDAP directories). It {{is important to consider}} storage and access control together since these issues are essential in implementations for XML documents management. Moreover, the chapter focuses on the recent access control models which guarantee the security of the XML-based data which are located in a variety of storage topologies. This chapter's goal is to survey and classify existing approaches for XML <b>documents</b> <b>storage</b> and access control and at the same time, highlight the main differences between them.
