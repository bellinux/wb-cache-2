40|$|Objectives] This paper aims to {{strengthen}} the control effect of propulsion motors and decrease the energy used during actual control procedures. [Methods] Based on the traditional propulsion motor <b>equivalence</b> <b>circuit,</b> we increase the iron loss current component, introduce the definition of power matching ratio, calculate the highest efficiency of a motor at a given speed and discuss the flux corresponding to the power matching ratio with the highest efficiency. In the original motor vector efficiency optimization control module, an efficiency optimization control module is added so as to achieve motor efficiency optimization and energy conservation. [Results] MATLAB/Simulink simulation data shows that the efficiency optimization control method is suitable for most conditions. The operation efficiency of the improved motor model is significantly {{higher than that of}} the original motor model, and its dynamic performance is good.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy has been performed to study the variation of electronic and ionic processes in the DSC during the aging. A model of the <b>equivalence</b> <b>circuit,</b> Rs(RPtQPt) (RrQµ) (RDoQDo), was proposed to describe the main features of impedance characteristics for studied DSCs. For the fresh–prepared DSCs with various iodine concentrations, all the RPt, Rr and RDo are increased with decreasing of iodine concentration and cell performance features, such as short-circuit current, open-circuit potential and energy conversion efficiency. The cell performance degradation under light and thermal aging was reflected by increasing of Rr and RDo which was clearly shown from impedance data analysis. There was observed a correlation between the sharp rise of RDo and the decrease of ISC. It was suggested {{that one of the}} reasons for DSC decays is the decrease of iodine content in the electrolyte after long-term light and thermal stressing tests...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that deciding <b>equivalence</b> of logic <b>circuits</b> is a coNP-complete problem.

40|$|The {{principal}} computational electromagnetics {{techniques for}} solving antenna problems are reviewed. An introduction is given on a historical review of how antenna problems were solved in the past. The call for precise solutions {{calls for the}} use of numerical methods as found in computational electromagnetics. A brief introduction on differential equation solutions and integral solutions is given. The Green’s function concept is introduced to facilitate the formulation of integral equations. Numerical methods and fast algorithms to solve these equations are discussed. Then an overview of how electromagnetic theory relates to circuit theory is presented. Then the concept of partial element <b>equivalence</b> <b>circuit</b> is introduced to facilitate solutions to more complex problems. In antenna technology, one invariably has to have a good combined understanding of the wave theory and circuit theory. Next, the discussion on the computation of electromagnetic solutions in the “twilight zone ” where circuit theory meets wave theory was presented.

40|$|Introductory {{experiments}} in a transmission line or microwave course are generally {{carried out at}} GHz frequencies. The objectives in such experiments often include plotting the standing wave pattern and finding the wavelength, the VSWR (Voltage Standing Wave Ratio), and the propagation constant. More involved experiments might look at the effect of load changes on the VSWR and ask for matching a line by reactive stubs connected near a mismatched load. The reason for operation at high frequencies is that the line segments under study are physically limited to lab table dimensions; therefore, {{to be able to}} examine a few half-wave lengths of the standing wave necessitates short wavelengths. Since the components and the instrumentation at these frequencies are costly, such setups are often out of reach of small engineering technology programs. It turns out that a good substitute for actual lines for the basic experiments is the transmission line model based on the lumped-element <b>equivalence</b> <b>circuit.</b> With an adequate number of lumped elements and appropriate component values, these models can provide the required multiple half-waves along their “lengths ” at audio frequencies rather than at the GHz ranges.

40|$|In this thesis, it is {{our biggest}} {{interest}} to develop full-wave based engineering friendly electromagnetic modeling approaches for coupling and radiation problems that are found in multi-physics and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) applications. The partial element equivalent circuit (PEEC) method, a unique bridging method between electromagnetics and circuit theory, is employed and extended to address new challenges in electromagnetic analysis. Firstly, we developed the first derived equivalent circuit model of arbitrary shape graphene sheets. It is also a novel contribution to PEEC for handling dispersive and anisotropic medium. Graphene’s numerical modeling is extremely cost prohibitive due to the huge contrast between its thickness and other dimensions. In this work, for the first time, the electromagnetic features of graphene are characterized by a derived equivalent circuit model from the first principle. Physical properties of the material can be conveniently obtained, such as radiation, scattering and resistance properties. Secondly, we developed the equivalent circuit model for optical electronic devices. By developing a new generalized equivalent circuit model for nanoantennas derived from the wave equation, not only material properties such as dispersivity and loss of the permittivity can be handled conveniently and efficiently, but also more physical insight of the working mechanism can be developed from the derived model. Thirdly, we developed a physics-based model size reduction (PMSR) method for key coupling analysis in the power integrity (PI) for the power distribution network (PDN) design and optimization in integrated circuit (IC), Packaging, and printed circuit board (PCB). In this thesis, thec PMSR method is applied to get the equivalent circuit model for above-ground geometries. The extracted physics-based models {{can be used to}} analyze the objective structure by parts. Lastly, we devoted great efforts in redefining the fundamental electromagnetic radiation mechanism through a distributive modeling approach. Even though radiation is being used and calculated everywhere from scientific researches, most radiation effects were successfully calculated without investigating how and why. In this thesis, by partitioning the object into pieces and extracting <b>equivalence</b> <b>circuit</b> for each piece, we derived novel formulations for both the radiated power and the transferred power between parts of the radiator. The approach can be instructively applied to EMC/EMI and other power distribution computations. Furthermore, from the global point of view which is another extreme view point of observing the radiation, we developed the PEEC based characteristic mode analysis approach. In this thesis, the characteristic mode (CM) analysis has been implemented together with the electric field integral equation (EFIE) based numerical methods to identify the trouble-makers during the radiation process. This thesis provides a guideline in discovering radiation related geometrical features, and designing methodologies for real geometries. As a summary, enlightened by the PEEC approach, we develop novel algorithms in both fundamental analysis methods for multi-physics and radiation mechanisms, and engineering methods for power integrity and coupling analysis. All above proposed algorithms have been verified and demonstrated by various examples. Compared to conventional approaches, they provide more modeling conveniences, calculation efficiency, and deeper physics insights of the working mechanism. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
