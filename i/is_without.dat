50|$|Though no {{authentic}} {{figures of}} female literacy rate are available, even rudimentary guesses make the female literacy rate {{not more than}} 3%, while the male rate {{as reported by the}} NCHD is about 18%. 76 schools are working with one teacher and one room without any shelter. There are five registered Seminaries and five private Schools. The NCHD is running five feeder Schools. Teachers in these private schools work in a quack fashion and use very crude methods of teaching, including bastinado-type caning on the hands. 83% of schools <b>are</b> <b>without</b> electricity, 45% <b>are</b> <b>without</b> a boundary wall, 50% <b>are</b> <b>without</b> a toilet, and 35% <b>are</b> <b>without</b> drinking water.|$|R

5|$|After the festival, the Wagner family {{journeyed to}} Venice for the winter.

The legend that the attack was {{prompted}} by argument with Cosima over Wagner's supposedly amorous interest in the singer Carrie Pringle, who had been a Flower-maiden in Parsifal at Bayreuth, <b>is</b> <b>without</b> credible evidence. After a funerary gondola bore Wagner's remains over the Grand Canal, his body was taken to Germany where it was buried in the garden of the Villa Wahnfried in Bayreuth.|$|E

5|$|Arkham Asylum {{has also}} been praised for Gaspar Saladino's {{distinctive}} lettering work and giving characters their own fonts. The practice of giving characters customized lettering treatments has since become widespread, especially in DC's Vertigo line and many Marvel comics. Different speech bubbles were used for many characters: Batman's is black with white lettering, Maxie gets blue with a Greek font, while Joker's speech <b>is</b> <b>without</b> a bubble at all; the red, ink-spattered script used for his dialogue is as ungovernable as the character himself.|$|E
5|$|Clan chiefs may {{wear their}} crest simpliciter, that <b>is</b> <b>without</b> being encircled by the motto {{and without any}} feathers. It is more common, however, for a clan chiefs to wear their own {{personal}} crest within a plain circlet inscribed with their motto or slogan (pictured left). The chief's crest badge does not contain the strap and buckle that other clan members are permitted to wear. Clan chiefs are also entitled to wear three eagle feathers behind the circlet of their crest badge. On certain occasions, such as clan gatherings, it may be appropriate to use real eagle feathers. Clan chiefs that {{are members of the}} British Peerage or a feudal baron are entitled to wear the appropriate coronet or baronial chapeau above the circlet on their crest badge, though {{this is a matter of}} personal preference.|$|E
5|$|Human Rights Watch, {{in their}} 2008 report on Saudi Arabian {{criminal}} justice system, {{noted that the}} criminal procedure code introduced in 2002 lacked some basic protections but, as mentioned above, had been ignored by judges in any case. Those arrested are often not informed {{of the crime of}} which they are accused or given access to a lawyer and are subject to abusive treatment and torture if they do not confess. At trial, there is a presumption of guilt and the accused is often unable to examine witnesses and evidence or present a legal defense. Most trials are held in secret, that <b>is,</b> <b>without</b> the public or press. The physical punishments imposed by Saudi courts, such as beheading, stoning, amputation and lashing, and the number of executions have also been strongly criticized.|$|E

5|$|In {{the small}} town of Home, Pennsylvania, a woman gives birth to a {{deformed}} baby. Three similarly-deformed men bury it near their dilapidated house during a rainstorm. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are sent to investigate after the corpse is found by children during a sandlot ball game. While talking to Home's sheriff Andy Taylor (Tucker Smallwood), Mulder asks whether the Peacock brothers—the inhabitants of the house nearest to the crime scene—have been questioned about the baby. Taylor informs him that the house dates back to the American Civil War and <b>is</b> <b>without</b> electricity, running water, or heat. He also insinuates that the family has been inbreeding since the war. The three Peacock brothers watch the agents from their front porch.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Court of Appeal's judgment can be interpreted in one of two ways: that the exercise of a power is not amenable to judicial review either if it has no public element altogether, or if it has an insufficient public element. Neither of these interpretations <b>is</b> <b>without</b> complications. As regards the first interpretation, {{it may be difficult to}} conceive of an exercise of statutory power that has no public element at all. If the second interpretation is correct, there is doubt as to the level of sufficiency required for the exercise of a power to be amenable to judicial review as the Court did not explain this.|$|E
5|$|Morgaon is the adhya pitha – {{foremost}} {{centre of}} {{worship of the}} Ganapatya sect, which considers Ganesha as the Supreme Being. It attracts {{the greatest number of}} pilgrims in the Ashtavinayak circuit. Both the primary scriptures of the Ganapatya sect praise Morgaon. While Mudgala Purana dedicates 22 chapters to Morgaon's greatness, Ganesha Purana states that Morgaon (Mayurapuri) is among the three most important places for Ganesha and the only one on earth (Bhuloka). The other locations are Kailash in heaven (actually Kailash is a mountain on earth in the Himalayas, believed to have the abode of Ganesha's parents Shiva and Parvati) and Adi-Shesha's palace in Patala (underworld). According to a tradition, the temple <b>is</b> <b>without</b> beginning and without an end. Another tradition maintains {{that at the time of}} pralaya (the dissolution of the world), Ganesha will enter yoganidra here. Its holiness is compared with Kashi, the sacred Hindu city.|$|E

5|$|The 65th Infantry was {{credited}} with battle participation in nine campaigns. Among the distinctions awarded {{to the members of}} the 65th were a Medal of Honor, 10 Distinguished Service Crosses, 256 Silver Stars and 595 Bronze Stars. According to El Nuevo Día newspaper, May 30, 2004, a total of 756 Puerto Ricans lost their lives in Korea and a total of 3,630 men were wounded, from all four branches of the U.S. Armed Forces. More than half of these were from the 65th Infantry (This <b>is</b> <b>without</b> including non-Puerto Ricans). The 65th Infantry returned to Puerto Rico and was deactivated in 1956. However, Major General Juan César Cordero Dávila, Puerto Rico's Adjutant General (1958–65), persuaded the Department of the Army to transfer the 65th Infantry from the regular Army to the Puerto Rican National Guard. This was the only unit ever transferred from active component Army to the Army Guard.|$|E
5|$|The Upanishad {{asserts that}} anyone can renounce – this choice is entirely up to the individual, {{regardless}} of which Ashrama (stage of life) he is in. The Jabala Upanishad seems to justify suicide as an individual choice in certain circumstances, a view opposed by earlier Vedic texts and Principal Upanishads. Those too sick may renounce the worldly life in their mind. The Jabala Upanishad presents the Vedanta philosophy view that one who truly renounces lives an ethical life, which includes not injuring anyone in thought, word or deed. Such a sannyasi (renunciate) abandons all rituals, <b>is</b> <b>without</b> attachments to anything or anyone, and is one who {{is devoted to the}} oneness of Atman and Brahman.|$|E
