5000|$|Following their visit, EMI quickly made an {{experimental}} 4-tube camera by cobbling together parts from an EMI Type 203 image orthicon studio camera with parts from an EMI Type 204 three-vidicon industrial colour camera [...] This camera was demonstrated to the BBC {{and received a}} lukewarm reception there. It produced sharp pictures, as expected, but there were problems with colorimetry. [...] Pictures of this camera {{can be found on}} various websites (it is not a pretty camera!).

50|$|In 1962, {{in order}} to address these {{stability}} problems, RCA announced their prototype four-tube camera. The aims of the designers of the camera were, firstly, to produce a camera that was more tolerant to mis-registration and, secondly, to achieve a lighter camera by using smaller vidicon tubes to replace some of the large heavy IO tubes. The camera had an image orthicon tube for the luminance channel and three vidicon tubes for the colour channels. In addition, the camera was fully transistorized, apart from the four <b>pick-up</b> <b>tubes.</b> The camera went into full production in 1963 and sales of several hundred of the model were achieved over the next few years.|$|R

50|$|In {{spite of}} the BBC’s lukewarm {{reception}} of the experimental camera EMI persisted with the 4-tube concept, but now using Plumbicon tubes, as suggested by Wood although there was some delay before the work started. There were several reasons for the delay. Firstly, EMI’s board hesitated to provide the financial investment needed for the project. Secondly, there was indecision regarding where to place the work but, eventually, the Colour TV Department of the Research Labs. was chosen in preference to the Broadcast Equipment Division (the existing supplier of EMI's monochrome cameras and studio equipment). Thirdly, there was concern regarding the reliability of supply of Plumbicon tubes, as Philips was the only supplier. Fourthly, there were concerns regarding the variable quality standards of the early Plumbicon <b>pick-up</b> <b>tubes,</b> as some tubes were found to produce unstable pictures. Although most issues with tube quality were quickly resolved by Philips, there remained concerns regarding 'comet tails' and 'blooming'.|$|R
5000|$|Rank Taylor Hobson {{declined}} {{to offer a}} zoom lens for EMI's new camera, claiming they were fully committed elsewhere, but the Angenieux Company (see Pierre Angenieux) expressed their interest in supplying zoom lenses for the project. The French company offered two zoom lenses for the camera; {{the first was a}} 10:1 zoom for studio use and the second a larger unit for outside broadcasts. Both could be accommodated within the body of the camera, although the O.B. lens did protrude a little. [...] To accommodate a 4-way prism splitter, extra distance was needed, {{from the back of the}} lens to the image focal plane, when compared to a 3-tube splitter. This set severe demands for the lens designer, but Angenieux were able to achieve EMI's requirements, provided that field flattening lenses were fitted in front of each <b>pick-up</b> <b>tube.</b> Early cameras used this arrangement, but with later zoom designs these lenses became unnecessary.|$|R
40|$|The Optical Multi-Access (OMA) Terminal {{is capable}} of {{establishing}} up to six simultaneous high-data-rate communication links between low-Earth-orbit satellites and a host satellite at synchronous orbit with only one 16 -inch-diameter antenna on the synchronous satellite. The advantage over equivalent RF systems in space weight, power, and swept volume is great when applied to NASA satellite communications networks. A photograph of the 3 -channel prototype constructed under the present contract to demonstrate the feasibility of the concept is presented. The telescope has a 10 -inch clear aperture and a 22 deg full field of view. It consists of 4 refractive elements to achieve a telecentric focus, i. e., the focused beam is normal to the focal plane at all field angles. This feature permits <b>image</b> <b>pick-up</b> optics in the focal plane to track satellite images without tilting their optic axes to accommodate field angle. The geometry of the imager-pick-up concept and the coordinate system of the swinging arm and disk mechanism for <b>image</b> <b>pick-up</b> are shown. Optics in the arm relay the telescope focus to a communications and tracking receiver and introduce the transmitted beacon beam on a path collinear with the receive path. The electronic circuits for the communications and tracking receivers are contained on the arm and disk assemblies and relay signals to an associated PC-based operator's console {{for control of the}} arm and disk motor drive through a flexible cable which permits +/- 240 deg travel for each arm and disk assembly. Power supplies and laser transmitters are mounted in the cradle for the telescope. A single-mode fiber in the cable is used to carry the laser transmitter signal to the arm optics.

50|$|In {{the early}} days of colour {{television}} (from the mid 1950s to the early 1960s) studio cameras were heavy and hot-running because of the vacuum tube (thermionic valve) circuitry that they contained, in addition to three large <b>image</b> orthicon <b>pick-up</b> tubes.With these cameras there was always a tendency for the three coloured images to drift out of registration, over time, giving a consequential loss of picture sharpness.|$|R
40|$|Although {{avalanche}} amorphous selenium (a-Se) is a {{very promising}} photoconductor {{for a variety of}} imaging applications, it is currently restricted to applications with electron beam readout. This is performed with a vacuum <b>pick-up</b> <b>tube</b> called a High-gain Avalanche Rushing Photoconductor (HARP) Vidicon. The electron beam readout is compatible with high definition television (HDTV) applications, but for use in medical imaging devices it should be replaced by an solid-state electronic readout with a two-dimensional array of metal pixel electrodes. However, due to the high electric field required for avalanche multiplication, it is a technological challenge to avoid dielectric breakdown at the edges, where electric field experiences local enhancement. We show that this problem can be overcome by the use of a Resistive Interface Layer (RIL) deposited between the uniform a-Se layer and the array of metal electrodes. By detailed analysis of charge transport properties we demonstrate that RIL enables stable avalanche operation in a-Se photoconductor without degradation in charge transport or avalanche multiplication gain. Our results showed that a stable gain of 200 is reached at 104 V/?m for a 15 -?m thick a-Se layer, which is the maximum theoretical gain for this thickness. We conclude that RIL is an enabling technology for practical implementation of solid-state avalanche a-Se image sensors...|$|R

Immediately following this visit, EMI Research Labs. embarked on a program to build an experimental camera using the same format. The construction took only six weeks of intensive effort, aided by the cannibalization of parts from existing EMI cameras. Items were taken from an EMI Type 203 image Orthicon monochrome studio camera, for the luminance channel, and a Type 204 industrial colour camera, for the colour channels. This camera contained 3 Vidicon tubes and a colour-splitting system using plate glass dichroic mirrors. In addition, a Varotal III zoom lens was integrated {{into the body of}} the experimental camera. The camera was housed in a simple box-shaped structure with ribs of extruded aluminium and with plain side panels. The experimental camera was demonstrated to the BBC in 1963 where it received a mixed reception.

[...] In order to better judge the performance of the then existing cameras, the BBC organized comparison tests between the experimental EMI camera, a Philips camera, and a Marconi three I.O. camera. In these tests, the colorimetry of the pictures from the EMI camera compared unfavourably with the other two, but it did give the sharpest pictures.|$|R
40|$|Ionic liquids (ILs) {{have been}} widely {{considered}} as potential green solvents for CO 2 capture, and many promising ionic liquids have been synthesized and reported. However, knowledge related to the hydrodynamics of CO 2 absorption with ionic liquids especially the bubble behavior is still scarce compared with the conventional molecular solvents. In this study, {{it is the first}} time to discuss the multi-bubble behavior in a carbon capture system with ionic liquid by using a high speed <b>image</b> <b>pick-up</b> system. The bubble behavior, such as bubble size distribution, total gas holdup, Sauter diameter and interfacial area at different operating conditions are investigated. The experimental results show that the bubble diameter of CO 2 -[bmim][BE 4] system is smaller than that of N- 2 -[bmim][BF 4] system. The bubble diameter increases as the gas superficial velocity increases and the height along the axis of the column rises, but decreases with the increase of the temperature. The total gas holdup in [bmim][BF 4] increases with the increase of the system temperature due to the decrease of the ionic liquid viscosity. In addition, the gas superficial velocity improves the total gas holdup due to the higher gas momentum favors the formation of small bubbles. A new correlation based on the experimental data is proposed for the prediction of Sauter diameter in gas-ionic liquid systems. The prediction results calculated by the new correlation are in good agreement with the experimental data with a relative error less than 6 %. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The world energy {{consumption}} will {{increase in the}} next decades. However, many aging oil fields are showing a steady decline in oil production. And they are producing increasing amounts of water, making {{the separation of the}} oil from the oil-water mixture an important processing step. In-line separation equipment using swirling flow can provide a light-weight, compact solution for offshore platforms and deepsea production sites, for which the use of large gravity-based separation vessels is very costly. In a collaborative project such an in-line separator has been investigated. The separator consists of a pipe, in which the internal swirl element (ISE) is placed. The ISE is equipped with vanes, which generate the swirling flow. Downstream of the ISE, the oil is extracted by a concentrically placed <b>pick-up</b> <b>tube.</b> In the pipe, the radial distribution of the axial velocity is W-shaped with an annular region of reversed flow and positive axial velocity {{in the center of the}} pipe and near the wall. The distribution of the azimuthal velocity shows a solid-body rotation in the center and a potential-flow vortex type of distribution at larger radius. A parameter study has demonstrated that the flow pattern in the separator is complex and that its dependence on the input parameters is complicated. For two-phase flow, the simulations predict good separation performance. However, the numerical results overpredict the separation efficiency, in some extreme cases by 50 %. The differences in results between experimental and numerical work decreases substantially when for the simulations an inlet droplet size is used, which corresponds more closely to the one in the flow loop at Delft University. Moreover, the inclusion of an anisotropic turbulent dispersion model in the computation may improve the numerical predictions. The result for poly-dispersed two-phase flow show only a modest increase in the Sauter mean diameter from 50 to about 80 µm in the center of the pipe. Although much progress has been made, further research is required to achieve a better prediction of the two-phase flow in a centrifugal separator...|$|R

Throughout the late 1940s, the company produced amplifiers for Sears, Roebuck and Company and Montgomery Ward. In 1954, Danelectro started producing the Danelectro lines of solidbody electric guitars and amplifiers. The company also made guitars and amplifiers under contract that were branded {{with the names of}} various store brands, such as Silvertone (Sears) and Airline (Montgomery Ward). Later Danelectro manufactured hollow-bodied guitars, which they constructed out of Masonite and plywood to save costs and increase production speed. These were distinguished by Silvertone's maroon vinyl covering, and Danelectro's light tweed covering. They used concentric stacked tone/volume knobs on the two-pickup models of both series—and [...] "lipstick-tube" [...] pickups, which contained the <b>pick-up</b> inside lipstick <b>tubes,</b> which have been said to be [...] "war surplus" [...] but which, in fact, Daniel ordered and bought directly from the manufacturer.

The baritone guitar never became especially popular, but found an enduring niche in Nashville for [...] "Tic-tac" [...] bass lines. In 1966, Danelectro was sold to MCA. A year later, in 1969, they introduced the Coral line, known for its hollow-bodies and electric sitars.
