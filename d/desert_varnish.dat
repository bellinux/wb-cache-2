5|$|Mars is {{the only}} planet in the Solar System on which deserts have been identified. Despite its low surface {{atmospheric}} pressure (only 1/100 of that of the Earth), the patterns of atmospheric circulation on Mars have formed a sea of circumpolar sand more than 5 million km² (1.9million sq mi) in area, much larger than deserts on Earth. The Martian deserts principally consist of dunes {{in the form of}} half-moons in flat areas near the permanent polar ice caps in the north of the planet. The smaller dune fields occupy the bottom of many of the craters situated in the Martian polar regions. Examination of the surface of rocks by laser beamed from the Mars Exploration Rover have shown a surface film that resembles the <b>desert</b> <b>varnish</b> found on Earth although it might just be surface dust. The surface of Titan, a moon of Saturn, also has a desert-like surface with dune seas.|$|E

These results are consistent with experiments that have determined divalent metal preferential adsorption for Pb, Zn, and Cu on interlayer crystallographic sites in birnessite [25]. Analytical studies also show a significant enrichment of Mn, Co, Pb, Ni, and Cu in <b>desert</b> <b>varnishes</b> [24, 26].|$|R
40|$|Ferromanganese {{coatings}} {{have been}} found on glacial erratics in Lydonia Canyon, off the United States northeastern coast. The coatings, which are about 17 µm thick, consist of an outer manganese-rich layer which covers {{the top of the}} erratic, a middle transitional layer, and an internal iron-rich layer that encircles the entire surface of the erratic. Chemical analyses of the coatings, when compared with similar data on abyssal marine ferromanganese deposits, reveal comparable Mn/Fe ratios, higher P and Ti concentrations, and an order of magnitude less of Co, Ni, Cu, and most other metals.

40|$|Raman {{spectroscopy}} {{has been}} selected as a non-destructive powerful analytical method for forthcoming planetary exploration. In {{the context of the}} upcoming ExoMars and NASA 2020 missions (developed by the European Space Agency, IKI Roscomos and NASA) analysis of the biological and geological terrestrial analogues using laboratory instrumentation is of great importance; especially testing the performance of flight-like operating modes and conditions on the feasibility of flight instruments meeting their science goals. Here we present a set of measurements of terrestrial analogues (among them <b>desert</b> <b>varnishes)</b> selected in preparation for in-situ Raman analysis on Mars. Laboratory instrumentation has been used to fully characterise the samples in addition to being operated in modes consistent with ExoMars RLS instrument flight designs, sample preparation and delivery. We discuss the performance of the spectrometers regarding the detection of the target signatures and their geological context. The impact of instrument operating modes and application of flight instrument sampling philosophy (i. e. spot size, grain size, number of target locations, sample preparation and delivery) on the signal intensity and the limits of detection are also discussed.

500|$|Sandstone {{rocks at}} Twyfelfontein {{are covered by}} the {{so-called}} <b>desert</b> <b>varnish,</b> a hard patina that appears brown or dark grey. Engravings were effected by chiseling through this patina, exposing the lighter rock underneath. The indentations were created {{over the course of}} thousands of years. The oldest engravings might be as old as 10,000 years, and the creation of new works probably ended by the arrival of pastoral tribes around 1000 AD.|$|E
500|$|A {{large part}} of the surface area of the world's deserts {{consists}} of flat, stone-covered plains dominated by wind erosion. In [...] "eolian deflation", the wind continually removes fine-grained material, which becomes wind-blown sand. This exposes coarser-grained material, mainly pebbles with some larger stones or cobbles, leaving a desert pavement, an area of land overlaid by closely packed smooth stones forming a tessellated mosaic. Different theories exist as to how exactly the pavement is formed. It may be that after the sand and dust is blown away by the wind the stones jiggle themselves into place; alternatively, stones previously below ground may in some way work themselves to the surface. Very little further erosion takes place after the formation of a pavement, and the ground becomes stable. Evaporation brings moisture to the surface by capillary action and calcium salts may be precipitated, binding particles together to form a desert conglomerate. In time, bacteria that live {{on the surface of the}} stones accumulate a film of minerals and clay particles, forming a shiny brown coating known as <b>desert</b> <b>varnish.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Ground truth spectral signature data for {{various types of}} scenes, including ground with and without annuals, and various shrubs, were collected. When these signature data are plotted with infrared (MSS band 6 or 7) reflectivity on one axis and red (MSS band 5) reflectivity on the other axis, clusters of data from {{the various types of}} scenes are distinct. This method of expressing spectral signature data appears to be more useful for distinguishing types of scenes than a simple infrared to red reflectivity ration. Large areas of <b>varnished</b> <b>desert</b> pavement are visible and mappable on ERTS- 1 and high altitude aircraft imagery. A large scale vegetation pattern was found to be correlated with the presence of the desert pavement. The large scale correlation was used in mapping the vegetation of the area. It was found that a distinctive soil type was associated with the presence of the <b>varnished</b> <b>desert</b> pavement. The high salinity and exchangeable sodium percentage of this soil type provide a basis for the explanation of both the large scale and small scale vegetation pattern...|$|R
40|$|Tropical rock {{varnishes}} {{found on}} Hualalai and Mauna Kea Volcanoes, Hawai'i, vary systematically {{with time and}} environment. Radiocarbon dating of encapsulated organic matter, (K+ + Ca 2 +) /Ti 4 + ratios, and Zn, Cu, and Ni trace element concentrations in rock varnish are consistent with lava flowages established by K-Ar and 14 C dating, where samples are collected from arid microsites {{well away from the}} soil surface. However, inaccurate ages are obtained from rock varnish in subsurface locations and from sites with abundant lichens, cyanobacteria, and fungi that chemically erode varnish. In contrast with continental <b>deserts,</b> Hawaiian <b>varnishes</b> commonly interfinger with and are less common than rock coatings of amorphous silica. Laboratory experiments on Hawaiian rock varnishes indicate that K and Ca are preferentially leached relative to Ti over time and at higher temperatures.

500|$|The Campo de la Piedra Pómez ignimbrites (...) have {{a surface}} area of [...] They have a volume of [...] and are {{separated}} in two layers which form one cooling unit despite their different colour and mineral composition. They both contain pumice and lithic fragments and are poor in crystals. Both have a pyroclastic texture with pumices bearing a porphyritic texture. Dating techniques yield different ages; the most reliable one (argon–argon dating on sanidine) indicates that these ignimbrites were erupted 73,000 ± 23,200 years ago. Other proposed dates go {{as far back as}} 0.555 ± 0.11 mya. They do not cross topographic surfaces and were generated by tranquil release from the ground rather than through the collapse of an eruption column. The surface has been exposed to wind erosion, forming yardangs and ripple marks. The source of this eruption is unknown; the Robledo caldera may be the origin of this eruption but this is controversial.

50|$|Desert {{pavement}} {{surfaces are}} often coated with <b>desert</b> <b>varnish,</b> a dark brown, sometimes shiny coating that contains clay minerals. In the USA a famous example {{can be found}} on Newspaper Rock in southeastern Utah. <b>Desert</b> <b>varnish</b> is a thin coating (patina) of manganese, iron and clays on the surface of sun-baked boulders.

40|$|We have {{performed}} preliminary mapping of the manganese and iron {{present in a}} cross-section of a rock varnish from the Cima volcanic flows in the Mojave <b>Desert,</b> California. Rock <b>varnish</b> is a nanostratigraphic deposit found on typically fine-grained rocks in hyper-arid to semi-arid deserts (Figure 1 a) [1]. Rock varnish is defined as consisting of about 70 % clay particles held together by about 30 % iron and manganese oxides [2]. The mechanism(s) by which rock varnish nucleates and grows remains unknown despite more than 30 years of study using electron microscopy. The dating of rock varnish layers and a possible microbiological contribution {{to the growth of}} varnish have both been exceedingly controversial during recent years. Microbiology is often invoked as the mechanism of varnish growth due to the significant enhancement of manganese in varnish compared to the concentration in the host rock, but its involvement remains a mystery.

5000|$|An {{important}} {{characteristic of}} black <b>desert</b> <b>varnish</b> {{is that it}} has an unusually high concentration of manganese. Manganese is relatively rare in the Earth's crust, making up only 0.12% of its weight. In black <b>desert</b> <b>varnish,</b> however, manganese is 50 to 60 times more abundant. One proposal for a mechanism of <b>desert</b> <b>varnish</b> formation is that it is caused by manganese-oxidizing microbes (mixotrophs) which are common in environments poor in organic nutrients. A micro-environment pH above 7.5 is inhospitable for manganese-concentrating microbes. In such conditions, orange varnishes develop, poor in manganese (Mn) but rich in iron (Fe).
