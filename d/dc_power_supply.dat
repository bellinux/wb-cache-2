5|$|The ZX81's primary input/output is {{delivered}} via four sockets {{on the left}} side of the case. The machine uses an ordinary UHF television set to deliver a monochrome picture via a built-in RF modulator. It can display 24 lines of 32 characters each, and by using the selection of 2×2 block character graphics from the machine's character set offers an effective 64 × 44 pixel graphics mode, also directly addressable via BASIC using the PLOT and UNPLOT commands, leaving 2 lines free at the bottom. Two 3.5mm jacks connect the ZX81 to the EAR (output) and MIC (input) sockets of an audio cassette recorder, enabling data to be saved or loaded. This uses an unusual PWM encoding at a single frequency, giving an average rate of 307 bps nominal, varying between 400 bps for all '0's, to 250 bps for all '1's. This provides a somewhat temperamental storage medium for the machine, which has no built-in storage capabilities. The ZX81 requires 420 mA of power at 7–11 V DC, delivered via a custom 9 V Sinclair <b>DC</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b>|$|E
25|$|The first common {{application}} of wet aluminum electrolytic capacitors was in large telephone exchanges, to reduce relay hash (noise) on the 48 volt <b>DC</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> The development of AC-operated domestic radio receivers {{in the late}} 1920s created a demand for large-capacitance (for the time) and high-voltage capacitors for the valve amplifier technique, typically at least 4 microfarads and rated at around 500 volts DC. Waxed paper and oiled silk film capacitors were available, but devices with that order of capacitance and voltage rating were bulky and prohibitively expensive.|$|E

2500|$|It {{had been}} {{originally}} {{assumed that the}} useful life of the ex-German cars and the associated 800V <b>DC</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply</b> would be 15 to 20 years, {{and in the early}} 1970s {{it became clear that the}} time for a complete replacement of rolling stock had come – to occur on a day called 'Day X.' [...] Finally, on Sunday, 19 December 1976 all SKM traffic was halted in preparation for the switch-over, and on 20 December 1976 the entire SKM system was switched over to 3000V DC, the standard Polish system. On the changeover date, the electrical substations supplying 800V DC power were disconnected, and the power supply was reconnected to new electrical substations supplying 3000V DC which had been built in advance.

2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{vacuum tubes}} evolved from incandescent light bulbs, containing a filament sealed in an evacuated [...] glass envelope. When hot, the filament releases electrons into the vacuum, {{a process called}} thermionic emission, originally known as the [...] "Edison Effect". A second electrode, the anode or plate, will attract those electrons if it is at a more positive voltage. The result is a net flow of electrons from the filament to plate. However, electrons cannot flow in the reverse direction because the plate is not heated and does not emit electrons. The filament (cathode) has a dual function: it emits electrons when heated; and, together with the plate, it creates an electric field due to the potential difference between them. Such a tube with only two electrodes is termed a diode, and is used for rectification. Since current can only pass in one direction, such a diode (or rectifier) will convert alternating current (AC) to pulsating DC. Diodes can therefore {{be used in a}} <b>DC</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply,</b> as a demodulator of amplitude modulated (AM) radio signals and for similar functions.|$|E

2500|$|A railgun {{requires}} a pulsed <b>DC</b> <b>power</b> <b>supply.</b> For potential military applications, railguns are usually of interest {{because they can}} achieve much greater muzzle velocities than guns powered by conventional chemical propellants. Increased muzzle velocities with better aerodynamically streamlined projectiles can convey the benefits of increased firing ranges while, in terms of target effects, increased terminal velocities can allow the use of kinetic energy rounds incorporating hit-to-kill guidance, as replacements for explosive shells. Therefore, typical military railgun designs aim for muzzle velocities {{in the range of}} 2000–3500m/s with muzzle energies of 5–50 MJ. For comparison, 50MJ is equivalent to the kinetic energy of a school bus weighing 5 metric tons, travelling at 509km/h (316mph). For single loop railguns, these mission requirements require launch currents of a few million amperes, so a typical railgun power supply might be designed to deliver a launch current of 5 MA for a few milliseconds. As the magnetic field strengths required for such launches will typically be approximately 10 tesla (100 kilogauss), most contemporary railgun designs are effectively [...] "air-cored", i.e., they do not use ferromagnetic materials such as iron to enhance the magnetic flux. However, if the barrel is magnetic, i.e., produces a magnetic field perpendicular to the current flow, the force is augmented.|$|E
