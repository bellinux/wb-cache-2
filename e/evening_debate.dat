5000|$|In April 1760 it was rented for £180 {{a year to}} Teresa (or Theresa) Cornelys, an {{entertainer}} and courtesan born in either Vienna or Venice and mother of Casanova's daughter, who had used her married name, Pompeati, in her previous stay in London as an opera singer, and now called herself Madame Cornelys from the first name of her Rotterdam lover, Cornelis de Rigerboos. She made extensive renovations and extensions to the house, creating several sumptuously furnished rooms {{in the rear of}} the house along Sutton Street, in particular a concert-hall or ballroom 93 ft long and 40 ft wide with a supper-room underneath it 80 ft long and 34 ft wide and a [...] "Chinese bridge" [...] connecting the house proper to the new rooms. This may have been by Thomas Chippendale, who was one of her many creditors. She used the house to host sensational balls and masquerades, and beginning in 1771, also put on unlicensed operatic performances, for which she was fined. She was eventually arrested, imprisoned and declared bankrupt in 1772, after spending £5,000 in the previous five years alone. The assignees and a group of creditors agreed to offer up the house and its furnishings at auction in its entirety and to jointly bid up to £15,000, but the quick auction did not attract any other bidders and their agents were able to purchase it for £10,200; the other creditors were unsuccessful in trying to have the proceedings nullified. Until 1780, the owners attempted to revive the house's popularity for soirées, with some participation from Mrs. Cornelys but without success. They then announced an Academy of Sciences and Belles Lettres, with instruction for foreigners in 'the language, constitution and customs of England' and a Wednesday <b>evening</b> <b>debate</b> series called the School of Eloquence. The rooms continued to be advertised for hire for events, and were popular on Sundays, when few other venues were open.|$|E
2500|$|... "In the <b>evening</b> <b>debated</b> with John C. Bennett {{and others}} {{to show that the}} Indians have greater cause to {{complain}} of the treatment of the whites, than the negroes or sons of Cain" [...] (History of the Church 4:501.) ...|$|R
60|$|He {{spent much}} of the {{afternoon}} and <b>evening</b> <b>debating</b> whether or not his dignity would permit him to go. But he ordered the motor at half-past nine, and at ten o'clock precisely the clerk at the Ripton House was bowing to him and handing him, deferentially, a dripping pen.|$|R
50|$|On April 18, 2016, Wanner threw Interim PC leader Ric McIver {{out of the}} Alberta {{legislature}} for repeatedly {{refusing to}} sit down after learning that sheets explaining Wanner's ruling for an NDP amendment on a motion tabled by McIver had been distributed before the amendment was <b>even</b> <b>debated</b> on the floor.|$|R
500|$|Congress never {{enacted the}} {{resolution}} or <b>even</b> <b>debated</b> it, the national papers ignored it, and {{it resulted in}} a loss of political support for Lincoln in his district. One Illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him [...] "spotty Lincoln". Lincoln later regretted some of his statements, especially his attack on the presidential war-making powers.|$|R
5000|$|Richard Martineau {{became known}} for his column [...] "Ondes de choc" [...] (shockwave), which {{appeared}} in the Montreal weekly newspaper Voir until 1996. Martineau has also participated in <b>evening</b> <b>debates</b> on Télévision Quatre-Saisons, and was the moderator of those debates between May and September 2006. He hosted a radio programme until 2007.|$|R
50|$|For {{the next}} 24 years Hare {{worked as an}} aide to Evans, {{assisting}} the congressman primarily on constituent issues and labor problems. In {{the last few years}} of Evans's time in Congress, Hare attended several speaking engagements and <b>even</b> <b>debated</b> Evans's opponents in 2002 and 2004 because of the congressman's Parkinson's disease, which often prevented Evans from participating.|$|R
50|$|On April 18, 2016, McIver {{was thrown}} out of the Alberta {{legislature}} by Speaker Bob Wanner for repeatedly refusing to sit down despite the Speaker's requests after learning that sheets explaining the Speaker's ruling for an NDP amendment on a motion tabled by McIver had been distributed before the amendment was <b>even</b> <b>debated</b> on the floor.|$|R
50|$|Rightly or wrongly, McPeak {{was also}} often accused of {{ignoring}} {{the needs of}} enlisted personnel, non-flying officers, aeronautically-rated navigator officers, and looking out solely for his officers who were pilots, primarily single-seat fighter pilots. There was <b>even</b> <b>debate</b> over the somewhat traditional act of inducting him as the outgoing Chief of Staff into the Order of the Sword.|$|R

25|$|The monarch {{does not}} have the {{prerogative}} to impose and collect new taxes without the authorization of an Act of Parliament. The consent of the Crown must, however, be obtained before either of the houses of parliament may <b>even</b> <b>debate</b> a bill affecting the sovereign's prerogatives or interests and no act of parliament binds the Queen or her rights unless the act states that it does.|$|R
50|$|In April 2013, Gilmar Mendes {{was again}} amidst {{controversy}} by blocking {{the due process}} of legislation that would impose checks and balances {{to the power of}} the Brazilian Supreme Court by claiming that such legislation would be unconstitutional. Never before in Brazilian history had the judiciary branch intervened to stop a law or constitutional amendment before it was <b>even</b> <b>debated</b> and approved by the representatives of the people.|$|R
50|$|On January 9, 1918, Wilson {{announced}} {{his support of}} the women's suffrage amendment. The next day, the House of Representatives narrowly passed the amendment but the Senate refused to <b>even</b> <b>debate</b> it until October. When the Senate voted on the amendment in October, it failed by two votes. And {{in spite of the}} ruling by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, arrests of White House protesters resumed on August 6, 1918.|$|R
50|$|Other {{sports that}} are also {{included}} in interschools are: field hockey, cricket, swimming, squash, tennis, chess, golf and <b>even</b> <b>debating.</b> Golfing professional, David Frost, also matriculated at Paarl Boys' and continues {{to make a contribution}} to golf at the school. Paarl Boys' High School is currently ranked as the top rugby school in South Africa.Students of the 2 schools have traditional nicknames; the Boishaaiers are known as 'galpille' and the Gimmies as 'bloedworse'.|$|R
50|$|On October 14, 1967, René Lévesque {{left the}} Congress of the Quebec Liberal Federation and {{announced}} {{in a press}} conference held at Clarendon Hotel that he had quit the Liberal Party of Quebec and was from now on to sit as an independent member in the Parliament of Quebec. He cited as his reason for leaving the fact that his party had refused to <b>even</b> <b>debate</b> his proposal regarding the constitutional future of Quebec.|$|R
40|$|Entrepreneurship {{is a hot}} topic, {{yet there}} is no agreed {{definition}} of entrepreneurship. There is <b>even</b> <b>debate</b> about whether entrepreneurship can be taught! This text and case study collection is designed to stimulate critical thinking and reflective learning relating to entrepreneurship. This book enables you to focus on the key issues that need to be considered with regard to new ventures and/or a business plan module, as well as courses on theory and policy relating to entrepreneurship and small businesses...|$|R
50|$|The {{scientific}} {{debate in}} Norway is not centred on weather or not climate change exists {{as it is}} considered a certainty. Rather issues arise on the timescales at which human actions are impacting on the planet and how quickly our planet responds to significant increases in greenhouse gas emissions, i.e. global warming of surface temperatures. The scientific community has <b>even</b> <b>debated</b> the sustainability of different climate technological solutions in the press, i.e. carbon capture and storage, bioenergy and offshore wind power.|$|R
2500|$|Perot {{tried to}} keep his {{movement}} alive through the mid-1990s, continuing {{to speak about the}} increasing national debt. He was a prominent campaigner against the NAFTA, and <b>even</b> <b>debated</b> with then Vice President Al Gore on the issue on Larry King Live. Perot's behavior during the debate was a source of mirth thereafter, including his repeated pleas to [...] "let me finish" [...] in his southern drawl. The debate was seen by many as effectively ending Perot's political career. Support for NAFTA went from 34% to 57%.|$|R
40|$|In lieu of an abstract, {{below is}} the essay 2 ̆ 7 s first paragraph. 2 ̆ 2 Although it is {{included}} in The Nag Hammadi Library, a complete collection of Gnostic Scriptures, The Thunder: The Perfect Mind is unique in its style and composition and some scholars <b>even</b> <b>debate</b> its classification as Gnostic. Regardless of its philosophical influences, this distinctive work contains both timeless principles and culturally defined statements that legitimize its analysis and consideration as a worthwhile piece of literature. 2 ̆...|$|R
50|$|The Secretary of State led the Council. Sir William Cecil {{effectively}} led it; he was wise, cautious, cooperative with Elizabeth, trusted {{above all}} others, Elizabeth’s personal secretary, and chief adviser until his death, and therefore very influential; {{due to his}} great administrative ability, he had the reputation {{of one of the}} greatest English statesmen - historians have <b>even</b> <b>debated</b> whether the success of Elizabeth’s rule was more due to Sir William Cecil or Elizabeth. His son was also a member of Queen Elizabeth's Privy council.|$|R
5000|$|Swartzwelder is {{notoriously}} reclusive, and rarely, if ever, makes media appearances. At one point, fans of The Simpsons on the Internet <b>even</b> <b>debated</b> his existence: when considering his reclusiveness {{and the number}} of episodes credited to him, some theorized that [...] "John Swartzwelder" [...] was actually a pseudonym for when writers did not want to take credit for an episode, or for episodes that were penned by several writers in concert. Comedy writer Mike Sacks described Swartzwelder as the [...] "Thomas Pynchon of the comedy world." ...|$|R

5000|$|Why are we of {{the twentieth}} century... <b>even</b> <b>debating</b> this {{nonsense}} from primitive ages? ... As Western scholars often say, [...] "Science and religion advance and retreat in reverse proportion"... Morality is the natural power for goodness. Religious morality, on the other hand, really works by rewards and punishment; it {{is the opposite of}} true morality.... The basic nature of all living creatures, including the human race, not only nourishes self-interest but also unfolds as support of the group. This is the root of morality.|$|R
40|$|While its need {{is often}} {{advocated}} by the society as a whole, the economic paradigm substantially refuses to <b>even</b> <b>debate</b> about industrial policy. Main arguments against industrial policy lie on its selectivity {{as well as on}} the mutual commercial aggressiveness between countries that favouring particular interests may implicitly amplify. Neither of the two arguments are however convincing. An impersonal industrial policy may be envisaged by referring it to all those measures able to ensure the sustainability of the real economy as emerging, in a market economy, from commercial relations with other countries...|$|R
50|$|The vast {{powers that}} belong to the Crown are collectively known as the Royal Prerogative, the {{exercise}} of which does not require parliamentary approval, {{though it is not}} unlimited; for example, the monarch does not have the prerogative to impose and collect new taxes without the authorisation of an Act of Parliament. The consent of the Crown must, however, be obtained before Parliament may <b>even</b> <b>debate</b> a bill affecting the sovereign's prerogatives or interests, and no act of parliament binds the Queen or her rights unless the act states that it does.|$|R
5000|$|In July and August 2004, Triumph {{followed}} up with visits to both major parties' national conventions. During the Democratic National Convention in Boston (from which he was ejected), Triumph and Michael Moore attempted to crash Bill O'Reilly's set. O'Reilly, having his makeup applied at the time, shouted, [...] "If I {{have to come out}} there, Insult Dog, you're gonna be talking a lot higher than you are now." [...] He also gained entry to the Republican convention in New York, and <b>even</b> <b>debated</b> actor Ron Silver during the wrap-up on MSNBC.|$|R
5000|$|In many {{varieties}} of High and Low German, pronouncing syllabic consonants {{may be considered}} a shibboleth. In High German and Tweants (a Low Saxon dialect spoken in the Netherlands), all word-final syllables in infinite verbs and feminine plural nouns spelled -en are pronounced with syllabic consonants. The High German infinitive [...] (to walk) is pronounced [...] and its Tweants counterpart [...] is pronounced [...] Tweants scholars <b>even</b> <b>debate</b> {{whether or not this}} feature should be incorporated in spelling, resulting in two generally accepted spelling forms (either loopn or lopen).|$|R
30|$|While both PCA and SVD {{have been}} widely used in applied {{scientific}} research, most studies do not detail why centering is (within the framework of PCA) or should be (within the framework of SVD) performed at all. Few studies in applied disciplines, most of them dating back some decades ago, touch upon this question in-depth ([8, 39 – 44] or <b>even</b> <b>debate</b> it [45 – 48] when compared to numerous applications that employ PCA without detailing its mathematical background. In addition, the existence of a recent statistical study shedding light on the issue [6], indicates that the question itself is infamous.|$|R
5000|$|The film's {{basic premise}} is that the current {{scientific}} opinion on the anthropogenic causes of global warming has numerous scientific flaws, and that vested monetary interests in the scientific establishment and the media discourage {{the public and the}} scientific community from acknowledging or <b>even</b> <b>debating</b> this. The film asserts that the publicised scientific consensus {{is the product of a}} [...] "global warming activist industry" [...] driven by a desire for research funding. Other culprits, according to the film, are Western environmentalists promoting expensive solar and wind power over cheap fossil fuels in Africa, resulting in African countries being held back from industrialising.|$|R
5000|$|Bush, [...] "... <b>even</b> tough <b>debates</b> can be {{conducted}} in a civil tone... our differences cannot be allowed to harden into anger... we must act {{in a spirit of}} good will and respect for one another." ...|$|R
2500|$|Though {{the office}} of the Master of the Revels {{was one of the most}} {{influential}} posts in Elizabethan England, there is a paucity of information about the life of Edmund Tilney, the Master who was connected with the development of drama at that time. There have been various sources, most of which have offered erroneous information. Starting from scholars like Malone to Sidney Lee, there has been varied representation of facts on Tilney. There are no details about his issue or what happened to his wife as there was mention of neither in his last will and testament. [...] There are <b>even</b> <b>debates</b> about the possibility of Tilney having been knighted.|$|R
5000|$|In 1987, Kh. Bakayev was {{recognized}} as the best scientifically oriented student for his achievements in the regional archaeological conferences and, as a result, {{he was sent to}} Moscow to participate in the XXII All-Union student archeological conference, where Khasan was awarded a diploma of the winner of the first degree. And in the same year, Bakayev was invited to participate at the top level All-Union Scientific Conference titled [...] "Caucasus and civilizations of the Ancient East", in Vladikavkaz, Russia. This opportunity allowed him to contact and <b>even</b> <b>debate</b> with many scientists like I.M. Dyakonov, G.A. Melikishvili, Viacheslav Vsev. Ivanov, O.M. Japaridze, S.A. Starostin, A.Y. Militarёv, etc.|$|R
25|$|In March 1952, {{a poorly}} {{prepared}} Bevan {{came off the}} worse in an <b>evening</b> Commons <b>debate</b> on health with Conservative backbencher Iain Macleod: Macleod's performance led Churchill to appoint him Minister of Health some six weeks after his debate with Bevan.|$|R
5000|$|The theatre is {{the most}} sought-after and booked venue in The Athenaeum. It is a stage for almost any {{conceivable}} creative industry pursuit, from live theatre productions and shows to live concerts, film screenings and <b>even</b> conferences, <b>debates</b> and book launches.|$|R
