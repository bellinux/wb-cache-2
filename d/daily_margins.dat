40|$|Both in {{practice}} and in the academic literature, models for setting margin requirements in futures markets classically use daily closing price changes. However, as well documented by research on high-frequency data, financial markets have recently shown high intraday volatility, which could bring more risk than expected. This paper tries to answer two questions relevant for margin committees {{in practice}}: is it right to compute margin levels based on closing prices and ignoring intraday dynamics? Is it justified to implement intraday margin calls? The paper focuses {{on the impact of}} intraday dynamics of market prices on <b>daily</b> <b>margin</b> levels. <b>Daily</b> <b>margin</b> levels are obtained in two ways: first, by using daily price changes defined with different time-intervals (say from 3 pm to 3 pm on the following trading day instead of traditional closing times); second, by using 5 -minute and 1 -hour price changes and scaling the results to one day. Our empirical analysis uses the FTSE 100 futures contract traded on LIFFE. ...|$|R

40|$|Both in {{practice}} and in the academic literature, models for setting margin requirements in futures markets use daily closing price changes. However, financial markets have recently shown high intraday volatility, which could bring more risk than expected. Such a phenomenon is well documented {{in the literature on}} high-frequency data and has prompted some exchanges to set intraday margin requirements and ask intraday margin calls. This article proposes to set margin requirements by taking into account the intraday dynamics of market prices. <b>Daily</b> <b>margin</b> levels are obtained in two ways: first, by using daily price changes defined with different time-intervals (say from 3 pm to 3 pm on the following trading day instead of traditional closing times); second, by using 5 -minute and 1 -hour price changes and scaling the results to one day. An application to the FTSE 100 futures contract traded on LIFFE demonstrates the usefulness of this new approach.

5000|$|A {{closely related}} {{contract}} is a futures contract; they differ in certain respects. Forward contracts {{are very similar}} to futures contracts, except they are not exchange-traded, or defined on standardized assets. Forwards also typically have no interim partial settlements or [...] "true-ups" [...] in margin requirements like futures - such that the parties do not exchange additional property securing the party at gain and the entire unrealized gain or loss builds up while the contract is open. However, being traded over the counter (OTC), forward contracts specification can be customized and may include mark-to-market and <b>daily</b> <b>margin</b> calls. Hence, a forward contract arrangement might call for the loss party to pledge collateral or additional collateral to better secure the party at gain. In other words, the terms of the forward contract will determine the collateral calls based upon certain [...] "trigger" [...] events relevant to a particular counterparty such as among other things, credit ratings, value of assets under management or redemptions over a specific time frame, e.g., quarterly, annually, etc.|$|R

50|$|Leading {{up to the}} crash, in {{an attempt}} to free up {{additional}} money for trading, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), responsible for proposing and enforcing securities laws, had loosened several related financial regulations. Prior to significant policy reform in 2010, the act of selling short - essentially, borrowing and selling stock with the belief that its price will fall - and trading on margin - trading with debt - were strictly prohibited in China. However, in March 2010, China implemented a testing phase for their stock exchange in which 90 selected companies were authorized to be sold short and traded on margin. This list was expanded over time, with over 280 companies being given the same authorization in late 2011. Shortly thereafter, the CSRC implemented a total policy shift which legalized both practices across the entire stock market. These regulation changes led to significant increases in borrowing for the purpose of trading, and short selling became the most popular investing strategy among traders. From 2010, when the changes were implemented, to 2012, average daily short turnover increased from 0.01% to 0.73%, and average <b>daily</b> <b>margin</b> purchase turnover increased from 0.78% to 5.15%. As a result, the Chinese market was being flooded with debt-funded trades and risky short selling plays.|$|R

40|$|International audienceUsing <b>daily</b> data on <b>margins</b> and {{variation}} margins for all clearing {{members of the}} Chicago Mercantile Exchange, we analyze the clearing house exposure {{to the risk of}} default by clearing members. We find that the major source of default risk for a clearing member is proprietary trading rather than trading by customers. Additionally, we show that extreme losses suffered by important clearing firms tend to cluster, which raises systemic risk concerns. Finally, we discuss how private insurance could be used to cover the loss from defaults by clearing members...|$|R
40|$|Background : Aim of {{the study}} was to assess {{prostate}} motion on daily basis with respect to setup and to compare the shifts based on bony anatomy and gold fiducial markers. Materials and Methods : Gold fiducial markers were inserted in prostate under U/S guidance and daily portal images were taken and compared with digitally reconstructed images, both using bony landmarks and fiducial markers as reference. A dose of 2 MU was given for two orthogonal images daily. The mean and standard deviation of displacement using gold seeds and bone were calculated. Systematic and random errors were generated. The planning target volume (PTV) was calculated using the Van Herk formula. Results : A total of 180 portal images from 10 patients were studied. The mean displacement along x, y and z axes was 1. 67 mm, 3. 58 mm, and 1. 76 mm using fiducial markers and 2. 12 mm, 3. 47 mm, and 2. 09 mm using bony landmarks, respectively. The mean internal organ motion was 1. 23 mm (&#x 002 B; 1. 45), 3. 11 mm (&#x 002 B; 2. 69 mm); and 1. 87 mm (&#x 002 B; 1. 67 mm) along x, y and z axes, respectively. The PTV to account for prostate motion if daily matching was not done was 4. 64 mm, 10. 41 mm and 4. 40 mm along lateral, superoinferior, and anteroposterior directions, respectively. If bony landmarks were used for <b>daily</b> matching, <b>margins</b> of 3. 61 mm, 7. 31 mm, and 4. 72 mm in lateral, superoinferior, and anteroposterior directions should be added to the clinical target volume. Conclusion : Daily alignment using gold fiducial markers is an effective method of localizing prostate displacement. It provides the option of reducing margins, thus limiting normal tissue toxicity and allowing the possibility of dose escalation for better long-term control...|$|R
40|$|A recent nonrandomized {{pilot trial}} showed that {{hepatitis}} C virus (HCV) patients with genotype 2 / 3 and rapid virological response (RVR) had a 90 % sustained virological response (SVR) rate after 14 weeks of treatment. We aimed to assess this concept in a randomized controlled trial. In the trial, 428 treatment-naive HCV RNA-positive patients with genotype 2 or 3 were enrolled. Patients with RVR were randomized to 14 (group A) or 24 (group B) weeks of treatment. Patients {{were treated with}} pegylated interferon alpha- 26 (1. 5 mu g/kg) subcutaneously weekly and ribavirin (800 - 1400 mg) orally <b>daily.</b> The noninferiority <b>margin</b> was set to be 10 % {{between the two groups}} with a one-sided 2. 5 % significance level. RVR was obtained in 302 of 428 (71 %), and 298 of these were randomized to group A (n = 148) or group B (n = 150). In the intention-to-treat analysis, SVR rates were 120 of 148 (81. 1 %) in group A and 136 of 150 (90. 7 %) in group B (difference, 9. 6 %; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 7 - 17. 7). Among patients with an HCV RNA test 24 weeks after the end of treatment, 120 of 139 (86. 3 %) patients in group A achieved SVR compared with 136 of 146 (93. 2 %) in group B (difference, 6. 9 %; 95 % confidence interval, - 0. 1 to + 13. 9). Conclusion: We cannot formally claim that 14 weeks of treatment is noninferior to 24 weeks of treatment. However, the SVR rate after 14 weeks of treatment is high, and although longer treatment may give slightly better SVR, we believe economical savings and fewer side effects make it rational to treat patients with genotype 2 or 3 and RVR for only 14 weeks...|$|R
