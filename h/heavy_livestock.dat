5000|$|Dingoes {{can be very}} tame {{when they}} come in {{frequent}} contact with humans. Furthermore, some dingoes live with humans (due to practical, as well as emotional reasons). Many indigenous Australians and early European settlers lived alongside dingoes. Indigenous Australians would take dingo pups from the den and tame them until sexual maturity and the dogs would leave. Alfred Brehm reported cases where dingoes that were completely tame and, in some cases, behaved exactly like other domestic dogs (one was used for shepherding <b>heavy</b> <b>livestock),</b> as well as specimens that remained wild and shy. He also reported about dingoes that were aggressive and completely uncontrollable, but he was of the opinion that these reports [...] "should not get more attention than they deserve," [...] since the behaviour depends on how the dingo was raised since early puppyhood. He believed that these dogs could become very decent pets.|$|E

50|$|Eagle Lake is {{the only}} {{watershed}} which supports native Eagle Lake trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss aquilarum). These rainbow trout grow to very large sizes, possibly having evolved to live longer as low flows often restrict spawning runs up their main spawning stream, Pine Creek. The average size of Eagle Lake trout are about 1.5 lb and can exceed 10 lb. Adults quickly grow to a size of 17 to 18 in in three years and can live for up to 11 years. Since these Modoc Lakes are high in alkalinity, the trout have evolved to {{only be able to}} live in these lakes. These trout were once so abundant that there was a commercial fishery for them in the late 19th century. At the same time, extensive logging and <b>heavy</b> <b>livestock</b> grazing caused Pine Creek to change from a permanent to an intermittent stream in its lower reaches. In the early 1950s the few remaining eagle lake rainbow trout at the mouth of Pine Creek were rescued and used to start a hatchery program to maintain the species and the sport fishery. Because of the complete dependence of Eagle Lake rainbow trout on hatchery production, the American Fisheries Society considers it to be a threatened species and NatureServe has listed it as critically imperiled. Peter Moyle considers it {{to be one of the}} most endangered salmonids in California. However, a petition for listing the Eagle Lake rainbow trout as a threatened species was rejected by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1994, and a similar petition was rejected by the California State Fish and Game Commission in 2004. From 2007 to 2009 Bogard Spring Creek, a tributary to Pine Creek, was electrofished to remove non-native brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis).|$|E

50|$|A map made of Leeds in 1834 {{shows the}} area that is now Chapeltown was pasture land between Chapel Allerton and Potternewton villages and Leeds. Through the centre of this farmland, which was already {{earmarked}} at this time as a planned 'New Town of Leeds' suburb, ran the Leeds-Harrogate Turnpike Road which later became Chapeltown Road. Much of this land, called 'Squire's Pastures' was part of Earl Cowper’s estate. The Earl first sold this land for development in 1825, but planning and building was slow, and the sale was not completed until 1873. Before selling his land, the Earl also set out a Deed of Arrangement defining the residential character of any future building including the limitation of <b>livestock,</b> <b>heavy</b> industry and public houses in the area.|$|R
30|$|This {{migration}} {{from the south}} increased stocking density in the Kitengela plains. We did not record the numbers of immigrant livestock, but based on our frequent visits and discussions with herdsmen and livestock owners, we estimated that stocking density was more than doubled. This high stocking density must have led to heightened competition for forage, as there was little left {{by the end of}} July 2005, which is abnormal in Kitengela during a normal rainfall year {{as was the case in}} 2005. We suggest that this shortage of forage and water brought about by immigrant livestock induced the high starvation of the resident livestock. In addition, the fragmentation and inaccessibility of previously available pastureland in the Kitengela plains and year-round <b>heavy</b> grazing by <b>livestock</b> due to sedentarization probably also contributed to the higher mortality.|$|R
40|$|Plumeless thistle (Carduus acanthoides L.) is one {{of seven}} noxious weeds in Nebraska.

40|$|Abstract Browsing {{is one of}} {{the main}} factors {{determining}} survival, growth rate, woodland structure, and distribution of the high mountain tree Polylepis australis. This species has a substantial regrowth capacity, which may function as a mechanism to tolerate herbivory, but it is unknown to what extent it may compensate for the impact of herbivory. In 15 low-density tree stands subject to exclusion, moderate, and <b>heavy</b> <b>livestock</b> pressure, we selected 12 P. aus-tralis individuals m tall, tagged four new shoots per tree and measured shoot length every month during a year. At the stand and at the tree level, we analyzed monthly dynamics of growth and browsing, and the annual output in terms of total browsing and total gross and net growth (not discounting and discounting consumption, respectively). In addition, we assessed the influence of stand, tree and microsite characteris-tics on growth and browsing patterns. Polylepis australis fully compensated for herbivory in terms of shoot gross growth at moderate, but not at <b>heavy</b> <b>livestock</b> pressure. In terms of net growth, this species did not fully compensate for herbivory at any stocking rate. We found a strong coupling between browsing and growth along the year, suggesting that regrowth attracts browsing, and browsing promotes regrowth. At the stand level, annual gross growth was not affected by habitat characteristics, while at the tree level, annual gross growth decreased on more rocky microsites for browsed but not for unbrowsed trees. We concluded that stocking densities should be limited to allow for a reasonable annual net growth, as its nitrogen rich leaves are a valuable food resource and P. australis forests provide important ecosystem services...|$|E

40|$|In arid lands, where {{vegetation}} is sparse or absent, {{the open}} ground is not bare but generally {{covered by a}} community of small, highly specialized organisms. Cyanobacteria, algae, microfungi, lichens, and bryophytes aggregate soil particles to form a coherent skin - the biological soil crust. It stabilizes and protects the soil surface from erosion by wind and water, influences water runoff and infiltration, and contributes nitrogen and carbon to desert soils. Soil surface disturbance, such as <b>heavy</b> <b>livestock</b> grazing, human trampling or off-road vehicles, breaks up the fragile soil crust, thus compromising its stability, structure, and productivity.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has established that presettlement ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) {{forests in the}} southwestern USA were much more open. After Euro-American settlement, <b>heavy</b> <b>livestock</b> grazing, fire suppression, logging and climatic events favored dense pine regeneration.

Many riparian habitats observed had a suitable hydrology and bank structure for beaver but unsuitable broadleaf forest composition or regeneration due mainly to pure stands of conifers planted to the waters edge or <b>heavy</b> grazing from <b>livestock</b> and/or deer. In the presence of heavy grazing pressure, tree felling by beaver could ultimately decrease broadleaf species composition and bole density.

40|$|Increases in the tree:grass ratio with {{accompanying}} {{changes in}} herbaceous composition, called bush or shrub encroachment, is a worldwide phenomenon in savanna regions. Although <b>heavy</b> grazing by <b>livestock</b> is often {{believed to be}} the cause, {{it is clear that the}} factors and processes involved in bush encroachment are poorly understood. The effects of soil type and grazing on the tree:grass ratio in encroached Acacia mellifera-dominated savannas in the Northern Cape, South Africa, were investigated by means of vegetation classification and analyses of sequential aerial photographs. Acacia mellifera never occurred on clay pans, and in low numbers only in other clay and sandy soils. This trend is ascribed to the soil texture, soil water regimes and/or heavy utilisation in these areas. Soil rockiness was important in determining the long-term presence and abundance of A. mellifera, perhaps due to better soil moisture conditions. Long-term increases in A. mellifera in non-rocky habitats were also found, although the causes of this remain unclear. Grazing strategy did not prove to be important in determining presence or abundance of A. mellifera in the short- or long-term. Copyright © NISC Pty Ltd. Articl...|$|R
