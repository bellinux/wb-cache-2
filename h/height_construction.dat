Following a review of existing analytical and empirical guidance, this paper presents numerical modelling-derived guidance for flexible faced geogrid-reinforced structures constructed using cohesionless fill that incorporates installation methods.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop a terrain {{evaluation}} system for road corridor selection applicable to the intermontane basins in northern Thailand. The first stage involves database construction of the terrain factors which have a direct effect on construction costs. These factors are land cover, topography and landforms, surficial geology, soil strength, topsoil removal, difficulty of excavation, embankment <b>height,</b> <b>construction</b> materials, and drainage characteristics. Remote sensing and terrain evaluation techniques, field investigations and geotechnical laboratory tests are used to prepare maps of these terrain factors. The resulting maps are converted into digital database form as map layers by using Geographical Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS) [...] a raster-based Geographic Information System (GIS). These factors are incorporated into cost models. These are constructed using local engineering cost assessments which control the selection and specification of terrain factors. Under the GRASS environment the digital map layers of different terrain attributes are converted, based on the cost models, into cost surfaces (cost per unit area). The cost surfaces are subsequently combined into an integrated terrain-cost model. With different assigned end points and cost models, the applications of the single theme cost surfaces and the integrated terrain-cost models to least-cost route selection are provided. An existing road network can be incorporated in these applications. The quality and benefits of the database and system developed related to terrain conditions, data capture by remote sensing, GIS manipulation and modelling, and cost modelling are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Historic {{maps are}} a {{valuable}} resource for understanding our past. Historic preservationists, in their endeavor to conserve, protect, and preserve historic buildings and neighborhoods, use historic maps to gain a richer understanding {{of the places where}} we lived, worked, and played. This research explored the synergy of using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with historic maps to achieve a greater appreciation and understanding of the past. The Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps are a set of maps that traced the growth and development of major cities and neighborhoods from 1867 to 2007. Developed as an aid for insurance companies in estimating fire insurance liabilities in urban areas, the maps not only provide parcel information such as property sizes, block numbers, street names and addresses, they also depict a wealth of building information, such as shape and <b>height,</b> <b>construction</b> materials, locations of windows and doors, uses and occupants. When viewed over an extended time period, these maps accurately document the growth, decline and changes in cities and communities over time. ArcGIS software was used to digitize and map the rich source of data inherent in the Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps for a 25 -block area surrounding Fort Street Mall in downtown Honolulu, Hawaii. Seven time periods of Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps from 1914 through 1993 were digitized and mapped using GIS to demonstrate how urban areas could be studied and interpreted through this particular mapping method. The resulting methodology showed that by using GIS with historic maps to track and analyze urban changes over time, a wealth of information and insight about a community’s past is revealed, something that is not apparent when simply studying individual paper maps...|$|E
40|$|Buildings are {{evolving}} in <b>height,</b> <b>construction</b> materials, use, and compartmental composition at staggering pace. The {{tall buildings}} of today are {{a completely different}} entity {{to that of a}} decade ago with the propensity for change even greater in the immediate future. The advancements in structural engineering have arisen to make possible the increase in height, size and complexity. Forensic analyses of tall building fires have indicated that the needs of modern tall buildings are beyond the scope of applicability of current fire safety codes and engineering practices. The ever increasing heights combined with the limited number of vertical escape routes results in these two components becoming coupled. The considerable time that occupants spend within the stairwells means that for any fire strategy to be successful stairwells must remain smoke and heat free and the entire building structurally sound. Without adequate protection the number and width of stairwells is irrelevant, as smoke-logged stairwells are unusable and the Fire Safety Strategy is therefore void. Reported failure rates for stairwell smoke control systems are extremely high, this implies that safe stairwell tenability levels are currently not guaranteed, thus the cornerstone of contemporary tall building fire safety design may not be valid. This research project investigates current smoke control methods used for the protection of stairs in tall buildings through the review of literature and theory for the methodologies. In understanding the design assumption and actual stresses smoke control systems are subjected to, a novel concept for smoke control will be presented, investigated and developed. It is intended that this work will become a proof of concept, or otherwise for the novel smoke control system. Several conceptual smoke control systems were developed around the following principles; localised solution to minimise under or over pressurisation of the stairwell, performance be independent of fire size, perform under extreme environmental conditions and be effective when protecting a fully open door. Three concepts were investigated using CFD modelling, these being: - Concept 1 - vertical perimeter vents to the opening resulting in converging flow field - Concept 2 - concept 1 with the additional horizontal vent - Concept 3 – concept 2 with baffle chamber The preliminary modelling predicted that Concept 3 would provide the most robust solution. The provision of baffles provided stability to the vent flow which contained an area of high pressure within the baffle chamber, relatively to areas adjacent to the baffle chamber, this encouraged smoke flow away from the chamber. It appeared that the effectiveness of the system was a function of baffle flow and pressure load caused by wind and fire characteristics, the larger the pressure load across the door the greater the vent velocity required to limit or prevent smoke flow through the opening. Full-scale experiments were undertaken to prove in principle that the proposed baffle smoke control system can limit the passage of smoke through an opening under generated pressure loads. The experiments did demonstrate in principle the baffle smoke control system could be effective in limiting smoke flow through an open door under the pressure loads tested...|$|E
