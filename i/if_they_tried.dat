5|$|Eurostar {{passengers}} travelling {{inside the}} Schengen Area (Brussels-Lille or Brussels-Calais; Lille-Calais trips are not allowed) {{pass through a}} separate corridor in Brussels bypassing border checks, and enter carriage 18 of the train, which is reserved for these passengers. This arrangement was set up after numerous illegal immigrants entered the UK without {{the right to do}} so, by buying a ticket from Brussels to Lille or Calais but remaining on the train until London – an issue exacerbated by Belgian police threatening to arrest UK Border Agency staff at Brussels-Midi <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> to prevent passengers whom they suspected of attempting to exploit this loophole from boarding Eurostar trains.|$|E
5|$|Spence and Stilwell were arraigned on {{the robbery}} charges before Justice Wells Spicer, who set their bail at $7,000 each. They were {{released}} after paying their bail, but Spence and Stilwell were rearrested by Virgil for the Bisbee robbery a month later, on October 13, {{on the new}} federal charge of interfering with a mail carrier. The newspapers, however, {{reported that they had}} been arrested for a different stage robbery that occurred (October 8) near Contention City. Occurring less than two weeks before the O.K. Corral shootout, this final incident may have been misunderstood by the McLaurys. While Wyatt and Virgil were still out of town for the Spence and Stilwell hearing, Frank McLaury confronted Morgan Earp, telling him that the McLaurys would kill the Earps <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> to arrest Spence, Stilwell, or the McLaurys again.|$|E
5|$|The Prussian {{position}} at Kunersdorf was not substantially {{better than it}} had been a few hours earlier, but it was, at least, defensible; the Russian position, on the other hand, was substantially worse. While Frederick's principal force had assaulted the Mühlberge, Johann Jakob von Wunsch, with 4,000 men, had retraced his steps from Reitwein to Frankfurt and had captured the city by mid-day. The Prussians had effectively blocked the Allies from moving east, west or south, and the terrain blocked them from moving north; <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> such a foolhardy move, Moller's artillery would rake them with enfilade fire. The King's brother, Prince Henry, and several other generals encouraged Frederick to stop there. The Prussians could defend Frankfurt from their vantage point on the Mühlberge and in the city itself. To descend into the valley, cross the Kuhgrund and ascend Spitzberge against frightful fire was foolhardy, they argued. Furthermore, the weather was blisteringly hot and the troops had endured forced marches to reach the theater and the battlefield. They were exhausted and low on water. The men had not had a hot meal in several days, having bivouacked the night before without fires. Despite these arguments, Frederick wanted to press his initial success. He had won half the battle and wanted the whole victory. He decided to continue the fight. He transferred his artillery to the Mühlberge, and ordered Finck's battalions to assault the Allied salient from the northwest, while his main strike force would cross the Kuhgrund.|$|E

25|$|Fatah {{officials}} said that Hamas placed over 250 Fatah members under house arrest or in jail, putting them under threat of being killed by Israeli strikes and shooting them in the legs or breaking their limbs <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> to leave. According to Abbas, more than 300 Fatah members were placed under house arrest and 120 were executed for fleeing.|$|E
25|$|Interior Minister Mario Scelba {{announced}} {{that the government had}} 330,000 men under arms, including a special shock force of 150,000 ready to take on the Communists <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> to make trouble on election day. The definitive test of strength came in 1950 during a nationwide general strike and mounting street clashes. On one day in March 1950, hundreds were wounded, including many policemen, and 7,000 people were arrested.|$|E
25|$|Josef Fritzl told Elisabeth and {{the three}} who {{remained}} (Kerstin, Stefan, and Felix) {{that they would be}} gassed <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> to escape. Investigators concluded that this was just an empty threat to frighten the captives; there was no gas supply to the basement. He stated after his arrest that he told them that they would receive an electric shock and die if they meddled with the cellar door.|$|E

25|$|On December 5, 1946, the war council told Qazi Muhammad {{that they}} would fight and resist the Iranian army <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> to enter the region. The lack of Kurdish tribal support however made Qazi Muhammad only see a {{massacre}} upon the Kurdish civilians performed by the Iranian army rather than Kurdish rebellion. This forced him to avoid war at all cost, {{even if it meant}} sacrificing himself for his people, which eventually happened and led to his execution.|$|E
25|$|Women {{giving birth}} at Hotel-Dieu and other {{hospitals}} were almost always poor and often wanted {{to hide their}} pregnancy; they were literally confined, unable to leave, and {{were not allowed to}} have visitors. They wore bed clothes with blue markings so they could be spotted <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> to leave without authorization. They slept in large beds for four persons each. In 1795, the first maternity hospital in Paris was opened at Port-Royal, which eventually also included a school for training midwives.|$|E
25|$|B.B. Kahane, Columbia Pictures' Vice-President of Business Affairs, {{stopped the}} show from being broadcast. Kahane warned the Stooges that a {{contract}} stipulation restricted them from performing in a TV series that might compete with their two-reel comedies. Columbia further threatened {{to cancel the}} boys' contract {{and take them to}} court <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> to sell the series. To avert a legal hassle, the pilot was shelved and the project abandoned. The kinescope film is now in the public domain and widely available.|$|E

25|$|The {{soldiers}} {{supervised the}} construction of the Presidios (forts) and were responsible for keeping order and preventing and/or capturing runaway Indians that tried to leave the missions. Nearly all of the Indians adjoining the missions were induced to join the various missions built in California. Once the Indians had joined the mission, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> to leave, soldiers were sent out to retrieve them. In the 1830s, Richard Henry Dana, Jr. observed that Indians were regarded and treated as slaves by the Spanish-speaking Californios.|$|E
25|$|Another {{confrontation}} with the Americans broke out soon after the armistice when the French sent troops to occupy the French-speaking Italian border region of Val d'Aoste. The French commander threatened to open fire on American troops <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> to stop them, and an irate Truman ordered the immediate end to all arms shipments to France, and sent de Gaulle an angry letter saying that he found it unbelievable that the French could threaten to attack American troops after they had done so much to liberate France.|$|E
25|$|On 14 January, Ben Ali {{dissolved}} {{his government}} and {{declared a state}} of emergency. Officials said the reason for the emergency declaration was to protect Tunisians and their property. People were also barred from gathering in groups of more than three, otherwise courting arrest or being shot <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> to run away. Ben Ali also called for an election within six months to defuse demonstrations aimed at forcing him out. France24 also said the military took control of the airport and closed the country's airspace.|$|E

25|$|Six months later, Brusilovsky {{returned}} to Kiev, {{which had been}} liberated from Germany. In an attempt to earn some money, he joined a group of boys who shined shoes on the square {{in front of the}} train station. Every evening, a grown-up lad with the nickname Kot (Tomcat) would come to the square. He was connected with the local criminal class, and he would take most of the money the boys had earned. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> to hide what they had earned, the boys were dealt with harshly.|$|E
25|$|Riley and Babcock {{found that}} women are penalized {{when they try to}} {{negotiate}} starting salaries. Male evaluators tended to rule against women who negotiated but were less likely to penalize men; female evaluators tended to penalize both men and women who negotiated, and preferred applicants who did not ask for more. The study also showed that women who applied for jobs were not as likely to be hired by male managers <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> to ask for more money, while men who asked for a higher salary were not negatively affected.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Catholicism {{among many}} of the English was {{grounded}} in the fear that the pope sought to reimpose not just religio-spiritual authority over England but also secular power of the country; this was seemingly confirmed by various actions by the Vatican. In 1570, Pope Pius V sought to depose Elizabeth with the papal bull Regnans in Excelsis, which declared her a heretic and purported to dissolve the duty of all Elizabeth's subjects of their allegiance to her. This rendered Elizabeth's subjects who persisted in their allegiance to the Catholic Church politically suspect, and made the position of her Catholic subjects largely untenable <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> to maintain both allegiances at once.|$|E

25|$|Beckett {{told police}} the group {{travelled}} to Tathra Beach and {{spent some time}} there {{before returning to the}} camp site at White Rock. On the road leading to the camp site, Camilleri became disturbed at the car bottoming out on the uneven gravel road and became angry at the girls. The rear doors of the vehicle had been previously locked using the vehicle's child locks and there were no window winders, preventing the rear doors from being opened by passengers inside. Camilleri produced a knife and told the girls they would be stabbed <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> to escape. Beckett also produced a knife and went along with Camilleri in threatening the girls.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Catholicism {{among many}} of the English was {{grounded}} in the fear that the pope sought to reimpose not just religio-spiritual authority over England but also secular power in alliance with arch-enemy France or Spain. In 1570, Pope Pius V sought to depose Queen Elizabeth with the papal bull Regnans in Excelsis, which declared her a heretic and purported to dissolve the duty of all Elizabeth's subjects of their allegiance to her. This rendered Elizabeth's subjects who persisted in their allegiance to the Catholic Church politically suspect, and made the position of her Catholic subjects largely untenable <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> to maintain both allegiances at once. The Recusancy Acts, making it a legal obligation to worship in the Anglican faith, date from Elizabeth's reign. Later, assassination plots in which Catholics were prime movers fueled anti-Catholicism in England.|$|E
25|$|Slaves {{were the}} Nootkas' most {{valuable}} property (p.88), {{and might be}} killed <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>tried</b> to run away. Jewitt says that slaves ate with the family, the same food in different dishes (p.71), and were generally well-treated but {{had to work hard}} (p.88); often the king's household would run short of food, so he would beg elsewhere (p.59). Maquinna allowed Jewitt to undertake other work when not employed by him, and he used this privilege to make bracelets, fish-hooks, and so on, to trade with the chiefs of the village and other visitors. Other chiefs or kings, including the king Wickaninnish of the Tla-o-qui-aht (Clayoquot), attempted to buy Jewitt, but Maquinna declined (p.151). Machee Ulatilla, king of the Klaizzarts, wished to buy him, promising to release him to any European ship that passed, and {{in the end it was}} through his help that deliverance came.|$|E
