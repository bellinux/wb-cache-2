50|$|Eppendorf {{was founded}} in 1945 by Heinrich Netheler and Hans Hinz in the Hamburg {{district}} of Eppendorf {{on the grounds of}} the University Medical Center, originally as a workshop for medical devices. Dr Netheler and Dr Hinz used their extensive knowledge of radar technology to develop both the first ultrasound device and the stimulator, a machine used for diagnosing and therapeutically treating muscle and nerve damage. They also invented an <b>electrical</b> <b>thermometer</b> (the “Thermorapid”) that, for the first time, enabled body temperature to be measured in just a few seconds.|$|E
50|$|Kinnersley {{continued}} his experiments, invented an <b>electrical</b> <b>thermometer,</b> and proved that heat could {{be produced by}} electricity, which was not known before. In 1764, he published a syllabus of his lectures on electricity, a copy of {{which is in the}} Philadelphia Public Library. This pamphlet gave in detail most of the experiments that he performed, among others an orrery propelled by electricity; and he suggested that perhaps the solar system might be sustained in the same way. In the United States, he was better known than Franklin, and even in Europe his name was very frequently mentioned, as may be seen in Joseph Priestley's History of Electricity, and in a volume published by the Abbé Beccaria of the University of Turin.|$|E

40|$|Abstract − An {{automatic}} test system for clinical <b>electrical</b> <b>thermometers</b> {{was developed to}} enhance the efficiency of error tests. Besides the temperature measurement unit, mechanical drive and machine vision units were designed to implement {{automatic test}}s. An uncertainty analysis was also presented. According to the special measurement action of clinical thermometers, the Monte Carlo method {{was used to evaluate}} the uncertainty. The accuracy of recognition of indications was greater than 99 % in experiments. 2. SYSTEM The structure of the system is showed in Fig. 1. It involves three functional units: water temperature measurement and control unit, mechanical control and transmission unit, and machine vision unit. These units communicate with the upper computer and make up a coordinated system...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} effort {{examines the}} post-detonation environmental, safety, health and operational aspects of experimental explosive tests with mercury. Specific experimental information {{is necessary for}} the evaluation of post-detonation by-products in comparison with those potentially resulting from mercury-bearing material accumulation in biomass accumulation areas, such as landfills, from batteries, <b>electrical</b> switches, <b>thermometers,</b> and fluorescent lights (Lindberg et al 2001). This will assist in determining appropriate abatement techniques for cleaning the work environment and environmental mitigation to determine waste stream components and risk assessment protocol. Determination of the by-products for personal protection equipment and personal exposure monitoring parameters are also part of this experimental work...|$|R
50|$|By {{homogenizing}} climate datasets, it {{was found}} that sometimes inhomogeneities can cause biased trends in raw data; that homogenization is indispensable to obtain reliable regional or global trends. For example, for the Greater Alpine Region a bias in the temperature trend between the 1870s and 1980s of half a degree was found, which was due to decreasing urbanization of the network and systematic changes in the time of observation.The precipitation records of the early instrumental period are biased by -10% due to the systematic higher installation of the gauges at the time.Other possible bias sources are new types of weather shelters the change from liquid and glass <b>thermometers</b> to <b>electrical</b> resistance <b>thermometers,</b> as well as the tendency to replace observers by automatic weather stations, the urban heat island effect and the transfer of many urban stations to airports.|$|R
50|$|Other non-climatic {{changes can}} be caused by changes in {{measurement}} methods. Meteorological instruments are typically installed in a screen to protect them from direct sun and wetting.In the 19th century it was common to use a metal screen in front of a window on a North facing wall. However, the building may warm the screen leading to higher temperature measurements. When this problem was realized the Stevenson screen was introduced, typically installed in gardens, away from buildings. This is still the most typical weather screen with its characteristic double-louvre door and walls for ventilation. The historical Montsouri and Wilds screens were used around 1900 and are open to the North and to the bottom. This improves ventilation, but it was found that infra-red radiation from the ground can influence the measurement on sunny calm days. Therefore, they are no longer used. Nowadays automatic weather stations, which reduce labor costs, are becoming more common; they protect the thermometer by a number of white plastic cones. This necessitated changes from manually recorded liquid and glass <b>thermometers</b> to automated <b>electrical</b> resistance <b>thermometers,</b> which reduced the recorded temperature values in the USA.|$|R
40|$|Mercury-bearing {{material}} {{has been placed}} in municipal landfills from {{a wide array of}} sources including fluorescent lights, batteries, <b>electrical</b> switches, <b>thermometers,</b> and general waste. Despite its known volatility, persistence, and toxicity in the environment, the fate of mercury in landfills has not been widely studied. The nature of landfills designed to reduce waste through generation of methane by anaerobic bacteria suggests the possibility that these systems might also serve as bioreactors for the production of methylated mercury compounds. The toxicity of such species mandates the need to determine if they are emitted in municipal landfill gas (LFG). In a previous study, we had measured levels of total gaseous mercury (TGM) in LFG in the mg/m 3 range in two Florida landfills, and elevated levels of monomethyl mercury (MMM) were identified in LFG condensate, suggesting the possible existence of gaseous organic Hg compounds in LFG. In the current study, we measured TGM, Hg 0, and methylated mercury compounds directly in LFG from another Florida landfill. Again, TGM was in the mg/m 3 range, MMM was found in condensate, and this time we positively identified dimethyl mercury (DMM) in the LGF in the ng/m 3 range. These results identify landfills as a possible anthropogenic source of DMM emissions to air, and may help explain the reports of MMM in continental rainfall.

40|$|Mercury-bearing {{material}} enters municipal landfills from a {{wide array}} of sources, including fluorescent lights, bat-teries, <b>electrical</b> switches, <b>thermometers,</b> and general waste; however, the fate of mercury (Hg) in landfills has not been widely studied. Using automated flux chambers and downwind atmospheric sampling, we quantified the primary pathways of Hg vapor releases to the atmosphere at six municipal landfill operations in Florida. These path-ways included landfill gas (LFG) releases from active vent systems, passive emissions from landfill surface covers, and emissions from daily activities at each working face (WF). We spiked the WF at two sites with known Hg sources; these were readily detected downwind, and were used to test our emission modeling approaches. Gaseous elemental mercury (Hg 0) was released to the atmosphere at readily detectable rates from all sources measured; rates ranged from 1 – 10 ng m 2 hr 1 over aged landfill cover, from 8 – 20 mg/hr from LFG flares (LFG included Hg 0 at g/m 3 concentrations), and from 200 – 400 mg/hr at the WF. These fluxes exceed our earlier published estimates. Attempts to identify specific Hg sources in excavated and sorted waste indicated few readily identifiable sources; because of effective mixing and diffusion of Hg 0, the entire waste mass acts as a source. We estimate that at-mospheric Hg releases from municipal landfill operations in the state of Florida are on the order of 10 – 50 kg/yr, substantially larger than our original estimates, but still a small fraction of current overall anthropogenic losses...|$|R
30|$|A {{transient}} short hot-wire {{method was}} used to measure the thermal conductivities of the base fluids (k 0) and the nanofluids (k). The detailed measurement principle, procedure, and error analysis have been described in [37]. In our measurements, a platinum wire with a diameter of 50 μm was used for the hot wire, and it served both as a heating unit and as an <b>electrical</b> resistance <b>thermometer.</b> The platinum wire was coated with an insulation layer of 7 -μm thickness. Initially the platinum wire immersed in media was kept at equilibrium with the surroundings. When a regulation voltage was supplied to initiate the measurement, the electrical resistance of the wire changed proportionally with the rise in temperature. The thermal conductivity was calculated from the slope of the rise in the wire's temperature against the logarithmic time interval. The uncertainty of this measurement is estimated to be within ± 1.0 %. A temperature-controlled bath {{was used to}} maintain different temperatures of the nanofluids. Instead of monitoring the temperature of the bath, a thermocouple was positioned inside the sample to monitor the temperature on the spot. When the temperature of the sample reached a steady value, the authors waited for further 20 min {{to make sure that the}} initial state is at equilibrium. At every tested temperature, measurements were made three times and the average values were taken as the final results. A 20 -min interval was needed between two successive measurements. After the above-mentioned careful check on the measurement condition and procedure, the authors could gain confidence on the experimental results.|$|R
40|$|Large {{quantities}} of mercury (Hg) {{have been placed}} in municipal landfills from a wide array of sources, in-cluding fluorescent lights, batteries, <b>electrical</b> switches, <b>thermometers,</b> and general waste. Despite its known volatility, persistence, and toxicity in the environment, the fate of this Hg has not been widely studied. Using automated flux chambers and atmospheric sampling, we quantified the primary pathways of Hg vapor re-leases to the atmosphere at two municipal landfill operations in south Florida for eight days in April 1997. These pathways included landfill gas (LFG) releases from passive and active vent systems, passive emissions from landfill surface covers of different ages (includ-ing CH 4 “hot spots”), and emissions from daily activi-ties at a working face (WF). Hg vapor was released to the atmosphere at readily detectable rates from all sources measured. Emission rates ranged from ~ 1 to 20 ng m- 2 hr- 1 over aged surface covers (generally com-parable to background soils), from ~ 6 to 2400 ng/hr from LFG vents and flares, and from ~ 5 to 60 mg/hr at the WF. In general the fluxes increased from older to newer landfills, from fresh to aged cover, and from passive to active venting systems. Limited data sug-gest that methyl- and other organo-mercury com-pounds may also be emitted from these sites, suggest-ing an important area for future research. We estimate that atmospheric Hg releases from municipal landfill operations in the state of Florida are on the order of 10 kg/yr, or < 1 % of the estimated total anthropogenic Hg releases to air in this region...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work, we {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} the electrical and gravitational force fields on weakly forced convection (Reynolds numbers range from 500 to 5600) in a square duct heated from the bottom side. On the top side, we placed an array of sharp point electrodes. Microgravity conditions were obtained during a parabolic flight campaign. At the application of a sufficiently-high DC electric field, a plume-like motion is induced in the fluid by the mechanism of ion injection and heat transfer is dramatically augmented. The working fluid is the dielectric liquid HFE- 7100. Local temperatures on the heated wall were measured by liquid crystal thermography and by <b>electrical</b> resistance <b>thermometers.</b> By means of the temperature field, we were able to characterize the behaviour of the ionic jets and their interaction with the crossflow. We also investigated the effects of the Reynolds number, the gravity level, and the major electrical parameters on the average heat transfer coefficients. When no electric field is applied, heat transfer coefficients are influenced by the gravity level, particularly at the low flow rates. On the other hand, in the electrohydrodynamic regimes, heat transfer rates are not only enhanced, but also no longer gravity-dependent, showing that the resulting convection is dominated by the electric field intensity, conveniently controllable by the applied high voltage. Relatively small pressure drop increases caused by the induced flow were also measured. Profitable implementation of electrohydrodynamics in the design of compact heat exchangers and heat sinks such as cold plates is foreseen; possible benefits are pumping power reduction, size and weight reduction, and heat exchange capability augmentation...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{a commercially}} {{available}} photodetector based infrared thermography system, operating in the 2 – 5 µm range, for high frame rate imaging of temperature evolutions in solid materials is investigated. Infrared photodetectors provide a very fast and precise means of obtaining temperature evolutions {{over a wide range}} of science and engineering applications. A typical indium antimonide detector will have a thermal resolution of around 4 mK for room temperature measurements, with a noise threshold around 15 to 20 mK. However the precision of the measurement is dependent on the integration time (akin to exposure time in conventional photography). For temperature evolutions that occur at a moderate rate the integration time can be relatively long, enabling a large signal to noise ratio. A matter of increasing importance in engineering is the behaviour of materials at high strain rates, such as those experienced in impact, shock and ballistic loading. The rapid strain evolution in the material is usually accompanied by a temperature change. The temperature change will affect the material constitutive properties and hence it is important to capture both the temperature and the strain evolutions to provide a proper constitutive law for the material behaviour. The present paper concentrates on the capture of the temperature evolutions, which occur at such rates that rule out the use of contact sensors such as thermocouples and <b>electrical</b> resistance <b>thermometers,</b> as their response times are too slow. Furthermore it is desirable to have an indication of the temperature distribution over a test specimen, hence the full-field approach of IRT is investigated. The paper explores the many hitherto unaddressed challenges of IRT when employed at high speed. Firstly the images must be captured at high speeds, which means reduced integration times and hence a reduction in the signal to noise ratio. Furthermore, to achieve the high image capture rates the detector array must be windowed down, therefore there is a compromise made between the extent of the full-field imaging and the temporal resolution of the image capture. In the present work a maximum image capture speed of 15 kHz was achieved with a detector array of 64 × 12 elements and an integration time was 60 µs. Results from initial work on woven E-glass/epoxy tensile specimens are presented. <br/...|$|R
