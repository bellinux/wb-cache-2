25|$|It {{is known}} that changes in {{dendritic}} excitability affect action potential back propagation. Action potentials begin near the axon hillock and propagate {{down the length of}} the axon, but they also propagate backward through the soma into the <b>dendritic</b> <b>arbor.</b> Active back propagation is dependent on ion channels and changing the densities or properties of these channels can influence the degree to which the signal is attenuated. Plasticity of back-propagation in the dendrites occurs in less than one minute and lasts longer than 25 minutes. Back propagation is a method of signaling to the synapses that an action potential was fired. This is important for spike-timing-dependent plasticity.|$|E
50|$|Processes in this <b>dendritic</b> <b>arbor,</b> {{the network}} of teledendrons and dendrites, occur due to the {{oscillations}} of polarizations in the membrane of the fine-fibered dendrites, not due to the propagated nerve impulses associated with action potentials. Pribram posits that {{the length of the}} delay of an input signal in the <b>dendritic</b> <b>arbor</b> before it travels down the axon is related to mental awareness. The shorter the delay the more unconscious the action, while a longer delay indicates a longer period of awareness. A study by David Alkon showed that after unconscious Pavlovian conditioning there was a proportionally greater reduction in the volume of the <b>dendritic</b> <b>arbor,</b> akin to synaptic elimination when experience increases the automaticity of an action. Pribram and others theorize that, while unconscious behavior is mediated by impulses through nerve circuits, conscious behavior arises from microprocesses in the <b>dendritic</b> <b>arbor.</b>|$|E
50|$|Another {{important}} feature of dendrites, endowed by their active voltage gated conductance, is their ability to send action potentials back into the <b>dendritic</b> <b>arbor.</b> Known as back-propagating action potentials, these signals depolarize the <b>dendritic</b> <b>arbor</b> and provide a crucial component toward synapse modulation and long-term potentiation. Furthermore, a train of back-propagating action potentials artificially generated at the soma can induce a calcium action potential (a dendritic spike) at the dendritic initiation zone in certain types of neurons.|$|E

Assuming only that dendritic cost increases with total dendritic length and path length from synapses to soma, we find that branching, planar, and compact <b>dendritic</b> <b>arbors,</b> such as those belonging to Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, are optimal.

We employed intracellular dye injection in semifixed brain slices and 3 -dimensional reconstruction to study the <b>dendritic</b> <b>arbors</b> and spines of the major cortical output cells, layer III and V pyramidal neurons, during different stages of the estrous cycle.

In order to assess a potential mechanism for such interactions, I have investigated the effects of the target-derived trophic molecule for sympathetic ganglion cells on the development of dendrites in the rat superior cervical ganglion. Systemic treatment of neonatal animals with NGF for 1 or 2 weeks results in a striking expansion of ganglion cell <b>dendritic</b> <b>arbors,</b> as revealed by intracellular staining with HRP. During this period, neurons in treated animals extend new primary dendrites, and the length and branching of existing dendrites are increased compared to age-matched controls. These results support the idea that targets may regulate ganglion cell arbors via elaboration of NGF, and suggest an explanation for the correlation between animal size and dendritic complexity noted in several recent studies (Purves and Lichtman, 1985 a; Snider, 1987; Voyvodic, 1987 a).

The cell-surface receptors that control dendritic branching remain poorly understood. Here, we show that in Caenorhabditis elegans, a previously uncharacterized transmembrane protein containing extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains, which we name DMA- 1 (Dendrite-Morphogenesis-Abnormal), promotes dendrite branching and growth. Sustained expression of dma- 1 is found only in the elaborately branched sensory neurons PVD and FLP. Genetic analysis showed that loss of dma- 1 causes much reduced <b>dendritic</b> <b>arbors</b> while overexpression of dma- 1 results in excessive branching. Forced expression of dma- 1 in neurons with simple dendrites was sufficient to promote ectopic branching. Animals lacking dma- 1 are defective in sensing harsh touch.

50|$|These {{cells are}} some of the largest neurons in the human brain (Betz cells being the largest), with an {{intricately}} elaborate <b>dendritic</b> <b>arbor,</b> characterized by a large number of dendritic spines. Purkinje cells are found within the Purkinje layer in the cerebellum. Purkinje cells are aligned like dominos stacked one in front of the other. Their large dendritic arbors form nearly two-dimensional layers through which parallel fibers from the deeper-layers pass. These parallel fibers make relatively weaker excitatory (glutamatergic) synapses to spines in the Purkinje cell dendrite, whereas climbing fibers originating from the inferior olivary nucleus in the medulla provide very powerful excitatory input to the proximal dendrites and cell soma.

The proper {{function of the}} nervous system relies not only on correct targeting of axons, but also on development of neuronal-class-specific geometry of <b>dendritic</b> <b>arbors</b> [1 – 4]. To study the intercellular control of the shaping of dendritic trees in vivo, we searched for cell-surface proteins expressed by Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) neurons [5 – 7]. One of them was Neuroglian (Nrg), a member of the Ig superfamily [8]; Nrg and vertebrate L 1 -family molecules have been implicated in various aspects of neuronal wiring, such as axon guidance, axonal myelination, and synapse formation [9 – 12]. A subset of the da neurons in nrg mutant embryos exhibited deformed <b>dendritic</b> <b>arbors</b> and abnormal axonal sprouting. Our functional analysis in a cell-type-selective manner strongly suggested that those da neurons employed Nrg to interact with the peripheral glia for suppressing axonal sprouting and for forming second-order dendritic branches. At least for the former role, Nrg functioned in concert with the intracellular adaptor protein Ankyrin (Ank) [13]. Thus, the neuron-glia interaction that is mediated by Nrg, together with Ank under some situations, contributes to axonal and dendritic morphogenesis...|$|R

The principal neurons are glutamatergic, which give them a particular functional position in the basal ganglia system.

To this end, hormone therapy has been used to ease associated symptoms but the risk may outweigh the benefits. Here we explored whether genistein, a phytoestrogen, is effective in restoring the cognitive and central neuronal changes in late middle age and surgically estropause female rats. Both animal groups showed poorer spatial learning than young adults. The <b>dendritic</b> <b>arbors</b> and spines of the somatosensory cortical and CA 1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons were revealed with intracellular dye injection and analyzed. The results showed that dendritic spines on these neurons were significantly decreased. Remarkably, genistein treatment rescued spatial learning deficits and restored the spine density on all neurons in the surgically estropause young females. In late middle age females, genistein was as effective as estradiol in restoring spines; however, the recovery was less thorough than on young OHE rats. Neither genistein nor estradiol rectified the shortened <b>dendritic</b> <b>arbors</b> of the aging cortical pyramidal neurons suggesting that <b>dendritic</b> <b>arbors</b> and spines are differently modulated. Thus, genistein could work at central level to restore excitatory connectivity and appears to be potent alternative to estradiol for easing aging and menopausal syndromes...|$|R

40|$|The basal <b>dendritic</b> <b>arbors</b> of layer III {{pyramidal}} neurons {{are known}} to vary systematically among primate visual areas. Generally, those in areas associated with "higher" level cortical processing have larger and more spinous <b>dendritic</b> <b>arbors,</b> which {{may be an important}} factor for determining function within these areas. Moreover, the tangential area of their arbors are proportional to those of the periodic supragranular patches of intrinsic connections in many different areas. The morphological parameters of both <b>dendritic</b> and axon <b>arbors</b> may be important for the sampling strategies of cells in different cortical areas. However, in visual cortex, intrinsic patches are a feature of supragranular cortex, and are weaker or nonexistent in infragranular cortex. Thus, the systematic variation in the <b>dendritic</b> <b>arbors</b> of pyramidal cells in supragranular cortex may reflect intrinsic axon projections, rather than differences in columnar organization. The present study was aimed at establishing whether cells in the infragranular layers also vary in terms of dendritic morphology among different cortical areas, and whether these variations mirror the ones demonstrated in supragranular cortex. Layer V pyramidal neurons were injected with Lucifer yellow in flat-mounted cortical slices taken from cytoarchitectonic areas TEO and TE and the superior polysensory area (STP) of the macaque monkey. The results demonstrate that cells in STP were larger, had more bifurcations, and were more spinous than those in TE, which in turn were larger, had more bifurcations and were more spinous than those in TEO. These results parallel morphological variation seen in layer III pyramidal neurons, suggesting that increasing complexity of basal <b>dendritic</b> <b>arbors</b> of cells, with progression through higher areas of the temporal lobe, is a general organizational principle. It is proposed that the differences in microcircuitry may contribute to the determination of the functional signatures of neurons in different cortical areas.
