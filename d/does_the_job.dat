He found the graphics to be lackluster and the terrain to be [...] "a bit empty", which he believed damaged the game's atmosphere. However, he noted that Flight Unlimited IIs [...] "underlying playability" [...] made it [...] "worthwhile" [...] and [...] "addictive". Presley summarized, [...] "s a time-waster, a novelty item or an office toy, it <b>does</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> and it does it well." [...] Jonathan Gordon of The Independent wrote, [...] "The original Flight Unlimited promised much but delivered relatively little, and it's a similar story with this sequel." [...] He noted that the graphics, while good from a distance, became [...] "disappointingly bland" [...] up close; and he found the game to be limited compared to Microsoft Flight Simulator '98.|$|E

2500|$|The album {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 46, based on nine reviews, which indicates [...] "mixed or average reviews". Stephen Thomas Erlewine, {{editor at the}} music website AllMusic, gave a mixed review for the album, commenting that [...] "Lopez was never, ever about singing" [...] and referring to the album as [...] "high-sheen wallpaper, so flimsy that it peels away immediately after application." [...] Adam Markovitz from Entertainment Weekly commented that [...] "despite the star power she emits on screen, her vocals have always been less than stellar" [...] and that she [...] "often sounds limited and nasal, with a flatness that can feel downright Rebecca Black-esque at its worst." [...] However, Ian Drew from US Magazine awarded the album three out of five stars, praising Lopez for returning [...] "to her dance-diva-from-the-block roots." [...] In his review, Drew concluded that [...] "all in all, {{when it comes to}} her day job, J. Lo is solidly still in business." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave the album three out of five stars, saying that: [...] "Love? isn't the all-out dance album it could—and should—have been." [...] Cinquemani also saw that: [...] "the album's urban-leaning midtempo tracks feel oddly dated, like leftovers from an album recorded in a pre-Gaga world." [...] Hermione Hoby from The Observer gave the album a mixed review, saying that Lopez [...] "ends her four-year recording hiatus with a load of turbo-produced bangers." [...] However, Hoby was not impressed with the lyrics, commenting that they let the album down. [...] "The only thing impeding dancefloor abandon is the hilarity of the record's lyrics." [...] Alex Macpherson from BBC Music gave a favorable review for the album. He said that Lopez [...] "possesses both a lightness of touch and the effortless confidence of one of nature's own divas, which means that whenever she hits the floor to essay up-tempo swagger tracks she convinces without being as overbearing." [...] MacPherson also felt that [...] "Love? seeks to showcase her vulnerability and depth of feeling." [...] The Los Angeles Times was critical of the album, rating it one-and-a-half out of four stars, and referring to it as [...] "a limp, personality-free dance-pop collection with plenty of A-list collaborations (Tricky Stewart, RedOne, Lady Gaga) but none of the lightweight charm she once brought in hits like 'Waiting for Tonight' and 'Jenny from the Block'." [...] Jody Rosen from Rolling Stone rated it two stars out of five and said that: [...] "Love? arrives with shiny production credits, but it's undone by J.Lo's slight voice and slighter personality." [...] Robert Copsey from the entertainment website Digital Spy gave a more favorable review for the album, rating it three stars and stating that: [...] "As a comeback album, Love? <b>does</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> perfectly– hauling an almost-forgotten Lopez back into chart relevance with a collection of calculated, safe and bang-on-trend tunes that were constructed for radio and clubs alike." [...] At USA Today, Elysa Gardner rated it two stars out of four, writing that the release [...] "suffers from such a lack of personality." ...|$|E
