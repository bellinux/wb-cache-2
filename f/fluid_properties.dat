25|$|Unlike liquids and solids, gases are {{composed}} of discrete molecules which occupy {{only a small fraction}} of the volume filled by the gas. On a molecular level, flow fields are made up of the collisions of many individual of gas molecules between themselves and with solid surfaces. However, in most aerodynamics applications, the discrete molecular nature of gases is ignored, and the flow field is assumed to behave as a continuum. This assumption allows <b>fluid</b> <b>properties</b> such as density and flow velocity to be defined everywhere within the flow.|$|E

25|$|A flow {{that is not}} a {{function}} of time is called steady flow. Steady-state flow refers to the condition where the <b>fluid</b> <b>properties</b> at a point in the system do not change over time. Time dependent flow is known as unsteady (also called transient). Whether a particular flow is steady or unsteady, can depend on the chosen frame of reference. For instance, laminar flow over a sphere is steady in the frame of reference that is stationary with respect to the sphere. In a frame of reference that is stationary with respect to a background flow, the flow is unsteady.|$|E
25|$|The Reynolds number can {{be defined}} for several {{different}} situations where a fluid is in relative motion to a surface. These definitions generally include the <b>fluid</b> <b>properties</b> of density and viscosity, plus a velocity and a characteristic length or characteristic dimension (L in the above equation). This dimension {{is a matter of}} conventionnbsp&– for example radius and diameter are equally valid to describe spheres or circles, but one is chosen by convention. For aircraft or ships, the length or width can be used. For flow in a pipe or a sphere moving in a fluid the internal diameter is generally used today. Other shapes such as rectangular pipes or non-spherical objects have an equivalent diameter defined. For fluids of variable density such as compressible gases or fluids of variable viscosity such as non-Newtonian fluids, special rules apply. The velocity may also be a matter of convention in some circumstances, notably stirred vessels.|$|E

2500|$|By using a {{rotating}} mirror, a high-speed camera and correcting for geometric changes, PIV {{can be performed}} nearly instantly {{on a set of}} planes throughout the flow field. [...] <b>Fluid</b> <b>properties</b> between the planes can then be interpolated. [...] Thus, a quasi-volumetric analysis can be performed on a target volume. [...] Scanning PIV can be performed in conjunction with the other 2-dimensional PIV methods described to approximate a 3-dimensional volumetric analysis.|$|E
2500|$|For flow of gases, to {{determine}} whether to use compressible or incompressible fluid dynamics, the Mach number of the flow is evaluated. As a rough guide, compressible effects can be ignored at Mach numbers below approximately 0.3. [...] For liquids, whether the incompressible assumption is valid depends on the <b>fluid</b> <b>properties</b> (specifically the critical pressure and temperature of the fluid) and the flow conditions (how close to the critical pressure the actual flow pressure becomes). [...] Acoustic problems always require allowing compressibility, since sound waves are compression waves involving changes in pressure and density of the medium through which they propagate.|$|E
2500|$|A Newtonian fluid (named after Isaac Newton) {{is defined}} to be a fluid whose shear stress is linearly {{proportional}} to the velocity gradient in the direction perpendicular to the plane of shear. This definition means regardless of the forces acting on a fluid, it continues to flow. For example, water is a Newtonian fluid, because it continues to display <b>fluid</b> <b>properties</b> {{no matter how much}} it is stirred or mixed. A slightly less rigorous definition is that the drag of a small object being moved slowly through the fluid is {{proportional to the}} force applied to the object. (Compare friction). [...] Important fluids, like water as well as most gases, behave – to good approximation – as a Newtonian fluid under normal conditions on Earth.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{flow sensor}} is being {{developed}} at IMTEK to perform flow measurements independently of a <b>fluid's</b> <b>properties.</b> In this paper, we discuss the effect of flow speed on the frequency response of the sensor. Experimental measurements are conducted for air in a mini wind tunnel. Normalized amplitude and phase shift between selected temperature signals exhibit a second order response. The results suggest that under a certain speed level, the frequency response is independent of the flow speed. Thus, it can be possible to determine the <b>fluid's</b> <b>properties</b> regardless its flow condition...|$|R

2500|$|NMR logging, a {{subcategory}} {{of electromagnetic}} logging, measures the induced magnet moment of hydrogen nuclei (protons) {{contained within the}} fluid-filled pore space of porous media (reservoir rocks). Unlike conventional logging measurements (e.g., acoustic, density, neutron, and resistivity), which respond to both the rock matrix and <b>fluid</b> <b>properties</b> and are strongly dependent on mineralogy, NMR-logging measurements respond {{to the presence of}} hydrogen protons. Because these protons primarily occur in pore fluids, NMR effectively responds to the volume, composition, viscosity, and distribution of these fluids, for example oil, gas or water. NMR logs provide information about the quantities of fluids present, the properties of these fluids, and the sizes of the pores containing these fluids. From this information, it is possible to infer or estimate: ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{with the}} case of {{superfluid}} liquid helium, atomic nuclei are {{an example of a}} state in which both (1) [...] "ordinary" [...] particle physical rules for volume and (2) non-intuitive quantum mechanical rules for a wave-like nature apply. In superfluid helium, the helium atoms have volume, and essentially [...] "touch" [...] each other, {{yet at the same time}} exhibit strange bulk properties, consistent with a Bose–Einstein condensation. The nucleons in atomic nuclei also exhibit a wave-like nature and lack standard <b>fluid</b> <b>properties,</b> such as friction. For nuclei made of hadrons which are fermions, Bose-Einstein condensation does not occur, yet nevertheless, many nuclear properties can only be explained similarly by a combination of properties of particles with volume, in addition to the frictionless motion characteristic of the wave-like behavior of objects trapped in Erwin Schrödinger's quantum orbitals.|$|E
2500|$|The seeding {{particles}} are an inherently {{critical component of}} the PIV system. [...] Depending on the fluid under investigation, the particles {{must be able to}} match the <b>fluid</b> <b>properties</b> reasonably well. [...] Otherwise they will not follow the flow satisfactorily enough for the PIV analysis to be considered accurate. [...] Ideal particles will have the same density as the fluid system being used, and be spherical (these {{particles are}} called microspheres). [...] While the actual particle choice is dependent {{on the nature of the}} fluid, generally for macro PIV investigations they are glass beads, polystyrene, polyethylene, aluminum flakes or oil droplets (if the fluid under investigation is a gas). [...] Refractive index for the seeding particles should be different from the fluid which they are seeding, so that the laser sheet incident on the fluid flow will reflect off of the particles and be scattered towards the camera.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] is an {{idealization}} of {{continuum mechanics}} under which fluids {{can be treated}} as continuous, even though, on a microscopic scale, they are composed of molecules. Under the continuum assumption, macroscopic (observed/measurable) properties such as density, pressure, temperature, and bulk velocity are taken to be well-defined at [...] "infinitesimal" [...] volume elements -- small {{in comparison to the}} characteristic length scale of the system, but large in comparison to molecular length scale. <b>Fluid</b> <b>properties</b> can vary continuously from one volume element to another and are average values of the molecular properties. The continuum hypothesis can lead to inaccurate results in applications like supersonic speed flows, or molecular flows on nano scale. Those problems for which the continuum hypothesis fails, can be solved using statistical mechanics. [...] To determine whether or not the continuum hypothesis applies, the Knudsen number, defined as the ratio of the molecular mean free path to the characteristic length scale, is evaluated. Problems with Knudsen numbers below 0.1 can be evaluated using the continuum hypothesis, but molecular approach (statistical mechanics) can be applied for all ranges of Knudsen numbers.|$|E
