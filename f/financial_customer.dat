40|$|Using {{a unique}} dataset that covers 100 % of the Brazilian FX retail market, this paper {{contributes}} to the microstructure approach to exchange rates in at least four ways. First, we find a strict link between currency flows in the FX market and the Balance of Payments.

Third, we identify the nature of the feedback trading as "stabilizing"?: a 1 % depreciation rate decreases the <b>financial</b> <b>customer</b> fl?ow by US$ 111 million and the commercial fl?ow by US$ 46 million. Finally, we find that the central bank sells in average US$ 28 million for each 1 % depreciation in the exchange rate (lean-against-the-wind), and US$ 23 million for US$ 100 million of <b>financial</b> <b>customer</b> flow (liquidity provision) ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the behaviour of end-user order flows {{in the foreign}} exchange market around periods of intense and large-scale intervention activity by the Bank of Japan. First, we find very limited evidence that corporate customers are affected in the desired way by intervention. However, there is somewhat stronger evidence that profit maximising <b>financial</b> <b>customers</b> are adversely affected. Second, using a regression framework we again find evidence that corporate customers react in ways consistent {{with the intentions of}} the Bank of Japan, while <b>financial</b> <b>customers</b> act in the opposite way. The aggregate impact of intervention to buy the dollar is, if anything, to increase net purchases of the yen by the customers of the bank we analyse. Finally, we find very clear evidence that intervention matters in a microstructure analysis. The strong contemporaneous correlation between order flows and exchange rate changes observed in many studies essentially disappears on days in which the Bank of Japan intervenes...|$|R
