40|$|Jets in low-luminosity radio {{galaxies are}} known to {{decelerate}} from relativistic speeds on parsec scales to mildly or sub-relativistic speeds on kiloparsec scales. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this effect, including strong reconfinement shocks {{and the growth of}} instabilities (both leading to boundary-layer entrainment) and mass loading from stellar winds or molecular clouds. We have performed a series of axisymmetric simulations of the early evolution of jets in a realistic ambient medium to probe the effects of mass loading from stellar winds using the code Ratpenat. We study the evolution of Fanaroff-Riley Class I (FRI) jets, with kinetic powers L_j ∼ 1. e 41 - 1. e 44 erg/s, within the first 2 kpc of their evolution, where deceleration by stellar mass loading should be most effective. Mass entrainment rates consistent with present models of stellar mass loss in elliptical galaxies produce deceleration and effective <b>decollimation</b> of weak FRI jets within the first kiloparsec. However, powerful FRI jets are not decelerated significantly. In those cases where the mass loading is important, the jets show larger opening angles and decollimate at smaller distances, but the overall structure and dynamics of the bow-shock {{are similar to those of}} unloaded jets with the same power and thrust. According to our results, the flaring observed on kpc scales is initiated by mass loading in the weaker FRI jets and by reconfinement shocks or the growth of instabilities in the more powerful jets. The final mechanism of <b>decollimation</b> and deceleration is always the development of disruptive pinching modes.

The prediction {{is based on a}} simple scenario in which all quasars, radio-quiets and radio-louds, are assumed to have jets close to their accretion disks. Soft X-rays are produced via unsaturated Comptonization of UV photons from the disk in the (marginally) optically thick jet base. Nonthermal hard X-rays are produced further downstream. The scenario requires that (i) the jet kinetic luminosity is always of the same order as the UV luminosity and (ii) that the nonthermal radiative efficiency is ~ 10 %.

In particular, during the last years we have learned that the limit imposed by the speed of light sets a maximum amplitude to the instabilities, contrary to the case of classical jets.

40|$|In paper I, {{we showed}} that {{time-dependent}} general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) numerical models of accretion disks, although being highly turbulent, have surprisingly simple electromagnetic properties. In particular, the toroidal current density in the disk takes the form dI_ϕ/dr ∝ r^- 5 / 4. Guided by this simplicity, we use a time-dependent general relativistic force-free electrodynamics (GRFFE) code to study an idealized problem in which the accretion disk is replaced by an infinitely thin rotating equatorial current sheet. We consider both an r^- 5 / 4 current profile and an r^- 1 profile, the latter corresponding to the paraboloidal model of Blandford & Znajek (1977). The force-free magnetosphere we obtain with the r^- 5 / 4 current sheet matches remarkably well to the Poynting-dominated jet seen in GRMHD numerical models. By comparing to the non-rotating force-free model studied in paper I, rotation is seen to lead to mild <b>decollimation</b> of the jet suggesting that hoop-stress forces nearly cancel centrifugal forces. In order to study the process that generates the corona and disk wind and destroys the ordered field in the corona in GRMHD numerical models, the force-free field with the r^- 5 / 4 current distribution is embedded in an accretion disk and followed in a GRMHD simulation. Reconnection and magnetic stresses contribute to a magnetized, thermal wind {{without the aid of}} an ordered field threading the disk. Comment: 20 pages, 17 figures, accepted to MNRA...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{powerful}} new tool for fitting broadband gamma-ray burst afterglow data, {{which can be used}} to determine the burst explosion parameters and the synchrotron radiation parameters. By making use of scale invariance between relativistic jets of different energies and different circumburst medium densities, and by capturing the output of high-resolution two-dimensional relativistic hydrodynamical (RHD) jet simulations in a concise summary, the jet dynamics are generated quickly. Our method calculates the full light curves and spectra using linear radiative transfer sufficiently fast to allow for a direct iterative fit of RHD simulations to the data. The fit properly accounts for jet features that so far have not been successfully modeled analytically, such as jet <b>decollimation,</b> inhomogeneity along the shock front and the transitory phase between the early time relativistic and late time non-relativistic outflow. As a first application of the model we simultaneously fit the radio, X-ray and optical data of GRB 990510. We not only find noticeable differences between our findings for the explosion and radiation parameters and those of earlier authors, but also an improved model fit when we include the observer angle in the data fit.

40|$|Transverse {{stratification}} is {{a common}} intrinsic feature of astrophysical jets. There is growing evidence that jets in radio galaxies consist of a fast low density outflow at the jet axis, surrounded by a slower, denser, extended jet. The inner and outer jet components then have a different origin and launching mechanism, making their effective inertia, magnetization, associated energy flux and angular momentum content different as well. Their interface will develop differential rotation, where disruptions may occur. We here investigate the stability of rotating, two-component relativistic outflows typical for jets in radio galaxies. For this purpose, we parametrically explore the long term evolution of a transverse cross-section of radially stratified jets numerically With grid-adaptive relativistic MHD simulations, augmented with approximate linear stability analysis. We study the influence of dynamically important poloidal magnetic fields, with varying contributions of the inner component jet to the total kinetic energy flux of the jet, on their non-linear azimuthal stability. We demonstrate that two-component jets with high kinetic energy flux, and an inner jet effective inertia which {{is higher than the}} outer jet effective inertia are subject {{to the development of a}} relativistically enhanced, rotation-induced Rayleigh-Taylor type instability. This instability plays a major role in decelerating the inner jet and the overall jet <b>decollimation.</b> This novel deceleration scenario can partly explain the radio source dichotomy, relating it directly to the efficiency of the central engine in launching the inner jet component. The FRII/FRI transition could then occur when the relative kinetic energy flux of the inner to the outer jet grows beyond a certain treshold. Comment: 18 pages, ApJ accepte...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary mirror}} of very large submillimeter-wave telescopes will {{necessarily}} be segmented into many separate mirror panels. These panels must be continuously co-phased {{to keep the}} telescope wavefront error less than {{a small fraction of}} a wavelength, to ten microns RMS (root mean square) or less. This performance must be maintained continuously across the full aperture of the telescope, in all pointing conditions, and in a variable thermal environment. A wavefront compensation segmented mirror sensing and control system, consisting of optical edge sensors, Wavefront Compensation Estimator/Controller Soft ware, and segment position actuators is proposed. Optical edge sensors are placed two per each segment-to-segment edge to continuously measure changes in segment state. Segment position actuators (three per segment) are used to move the panels. A computer control system uses the edge sensor measurements to estimate the state of all of the segments and to predict the wavefront error; segment actuator commands are computed that minimize the wavefront error. Translational or rotational motions of one segment relative to the other cause lateral displacement of the light beam, which is measured by the imaging sensor. For high accuracy, the collimator uses a shaped mask, such as one or more slits, so that the light beam forms a pattern on the sensor that permits sensing accuracy of better than 0. 1 micron in two axes: in the z or local surface normal direction, and in the y direction parallel to the mirror surface and perpendicular to the beam direction. Using a co-aligned pair of sensors, with the location of the detector and collimated light source interchanged, four degrees of freedom can be sensed: transverse x and y displacements, as well as two bending angles (pitch and yaw). In this approach, each optical edge sensor head has a collimator and an imager, placing one sensor head on each side of a segment gap, with two parallel light beams crossing the gap. Two sets of optical edge sensors are used per segment-to-segment edge, separated by a finite distance along the segment edge, for four optical heads, each with an imager and a collimator. By orienting the beam direction of one edge sensor pair to be + 45 away from the segment edge direction, and the other sensor pair to be oriented - 45 away from the segment edge direction, all six degrees of freedom of relative motion between the segments can be measured with some redundancy. The software resides in a computer that receives each of the optical edge sensor signals, as well as telescope pointing commands. It feeds back the edge sensor signals to keep the primary mirror figure within specification. It uses a feed-forward control to compensate for global effects such as <b>decollimation</b> of the primary and secondary mirrors due to gravity sag as the telescope pointing changes to track science objects. Three segment position actuators will be provided per segment to enable controlled motions in the piston, tip, and tilt degrees of freedom.
