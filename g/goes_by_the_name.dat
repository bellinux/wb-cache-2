25|$|Arsenical bronze {{has seen}} little {{use in the}} modern period. It appears that the closest {{equivalent}} <b>goes</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>name</b> of arsenical copper, being defined as copper with under 0.5wt% As, below the accepted percentage in archaeological artefacts. The presence of 0.5wt% arsenic in copper lowers the electrical conductivity to 34% of that of pure copper, and even as little as 0.05wt% decreases it by 15%. Therefore, there is no demand for copper containing arsenic in electric wires etc., {{one of the major}} modern uses of copper and steam engine boilers are no longer made from it, leading to no modern use.|$|E
