25|$|The primary aim {{of modern}} warfare (in {{accordance}} {{with the principles of}} doublethink, this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by the directing brains of the Inner Party) is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living. Ever {{since the end of the}} nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society. At present, when few human beings even have enough to eat, this problem <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> <b>not</b> urgent, and it might not have become so, even if no artificial processes of destruction had been at work.|$|E

25|$|They {{come across}} a {{procession}} in which a young Indian woman, Aouda, is led to a sanctuary to be sacrificed by sati the next day by Brahmins. Since the young woman is drugged with opium and hemp and <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> <b>not</b> going voluntarily, the travellers decide to rescue her. They follow the procession to the site, where Passepartout {{takes the place of}} Aouda's deceased husband on the funeral pyre on which she is to be burned. During the ceremony he rises from the pyre, scaring off the priests, and carries the young woman away. The twelve hours gained earlier are lost, but Fogg shows no regret.|$|E
25|$|However, an {{algebraic}} {{function of}} several variables may yield an algebraic number {{when applied to}} transcendental numbers if these numbers are not algebraically independent. For example, π and (1 − π) are both transcendental, but π + (1 − π) = 1 <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> <b>not.</b> It is unknown whether π + e, for example, is transcendental, though {{at least one of}} π + e and πe must be transcendental. More generally, for any two transcendental numbers a and b, at least one of a + b and ab must be transcendental. To see this, consider the polynomial (x − a)(x − b) = x2 − (a + b)x + ab. If (a + b) and ab were both algebraic, then this would be a polynomial with algebraic coefficients. Because algebraic numbers form an algebraically closed field, this would imply that the roots of the polynomial, a and b, must be algebraic. But this is a contradiction, and thus it must be the case {{that at least one of}} the coefficients is transcendental.|$|E
500|$|Light in August has 21 chapters, as {{does the}} Gospel of St. John. As Virginia V. James Hlavsa points out, each chapter in Faulkner {{corresponds}} to themes in John. For example, echoing John's famous, [...] "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God", is Lena's insistent faith in the [...] "word" [...] of Lucas, who is, after all, the father. John 5, the healing of the lame man by immersion, is echoed by Christmas's repeatedly being immersed in liquids. The teaching in the temple in John 7 is echoed by McEachern's attempts to teach Christmas his catechism. The crucifixion occurs in John 19, the same chapter in which Christmas is slain and castrated. However, the Christian references are dark and disturbingLena <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> <b>not</b> a virgin, Christmas is an enraged murdererand may be more appropriately viewed as pagan idols mistakenly worshipped as saints.|$|E

2500|$|Also, sweep oar rowers usually feather {{and square}} the oar with the inside hand (the one {{closer to the}} rowlock), {{allowing}} the handle to turn within the outside hand, whose wrist remains flat throughout.

2500|$|The {{description}} of a universe that expanded and contracted in a cyclic manner was first put forward in a poem published in 1791 by Erasmus Darwin. Edgar Allan Poe presented a similar cyclic system in his 1848 [...] essay titled it <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> <b>not</b> a scientific work, but Poe, while starting from metaphysical principles, tried to explain the universe using contemporary physical and mental knowledge. Ignored by the scientific community and often misunderstood by literary critics, its scientific implications have been reevaluated in recent times.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{important}} {{case was}} O'Kelly v Trusthouse Forte plc. Some waiters worked various dinner {{functions in the}} Grosvenor House Hotel. They tried to form a union. They were dismissed. They claimed that this was unfair, and to do that, they had to show they were [...] "employees" [...] {{within the meaning of}} the unfair dismissal legislation. [...] The word [...] "employee" [...] had hitherto always been taken to mean someone who <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> <b>not</b> in business on his own account (i.e. not [...] "self employed"), but recognised as subordinate labour, economically dependent on the employer. However, Alexander Irvine QC argued that the waiters had no [...] "mutuality of obligation" [...] with the employer: they were not bound to accept work engagements when they were called up, and the employer was under no obligation to call them up. They could leave, or be fired, at will. Sir John Donaldson accepted this argument and deemed the waiters to fall outside of the scope of unfair dismissal legislation.|$|E

Even with a broken arm he might pull the fight off, as men have done before. There was too much money on for them to run any risks. They gave him a tap on the head, therefore, to prevent his making too much resistance, and they then drove him off to some farmhouse or stable, where they will hold him a prisoner until {{the time for the}} fight is over.

6000|$|The other, the {{so-called}} [...] "transmutation" [...] hypothesis, considers that all existing species {{are the result}} of the modification of pre-existing species, and those of their predecessors, by agencies similar to those which at the present day produce varieties and races, and therefore in an altogether natural way; and it is a probable, though not a necessary consequence of this hypothesis, that all living beings have arisen from a single stock. With respect to the origin of this primitive stock, or stocks, the doctrine of the origin of species <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> <b>not</b> necessarily concerned. The transmutation hypothesis, for example, is perfectly consistent either with the conception of a special creation of the primitive germ, or with the supposition of its having arisen, as a modification of inorganic matter, by natural causes.|$|E

60|$|Take for an {{illustration}} {{the story of}} Elisha and the bears. To {{the authors of the}} moral instruction books it is in the last degree reprehensible. It <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> <b>not</b> true as a record of fact; and the picture it gives us of the temper of God (which is what interests an adult reader) is shocking and blasphemous. But it is a capital story for a child. It interests a child because it is about bears; and it leaves the child with an impression that children who poke fun at old gentlemen and make rude remarks about bald heads are not nice children, which is a highly desirable impression, and just as much as a child is capable of receiving from the story. When a story is about God and a child, children take God for granted and criticize the child. Adults do the opposite, and are thereby led to talk great nonsense about the bad effect of Bible stories on infants.|$|E
60|$|The {{concentration}} of the world's capital in a few nations, which, by means of it, are able to drain all other nations of their wealth, <b>is</b> <b>obviously</b> <b>not</b> a system by which permanent peace can be secured except through the complete subjection of the poorer nations. In the long run, China will {{see no reason to}} leave the profits of industry in the hands of foreigners. If, for the present, Russia is successfully starved into submission to foreign capital, Russia also will, when the time is ripe, attempt a new rebellion against the world-empire of finance. I cannot see, therefore, any establishment of a stable world-system {{as a result of the}} syndicate formed at Washington. On the contrary, we may expect that, when Asia has thoroughly assimilated our economic system, the Marxian class-war will break out in the form of a war between Asia and the West, with America as the protagonist of capitalism, and Russia as the champion of Asia and Socialism. In such a war, Asia would be fighting for freedom, but probably too late to preserve the distinctive civilizations which now make Asia valuable to the human family. Indeed, the war would probably be so devastating that no civilization of any sort would survive it.|$|E
