At center, {{the steps to}} the door are visible, above which a small balcony can be seen. To the right, a large section of bay window can be seen. In front, a strip of road can be seen in just before the picket fence that encloses the property.; "Captain Cass came to Cayucos in 1867. Cayugos then known as Cayucos Landing. Lived first in a small house on the hill back of present town. Built a wharf and (?) house in 1870. Laid out the town with wide streets in 1875 at which time he built this house.

5000|$|Steward, Illinois, {{was named}} for Wesley Steward, who in 1855 came to this area in Alto Township to settle the land owned by his father, Marcus Steward. John Grimes built the first house in Alto Township in Plum Thicket in 1847, located east on the {{outskirts}} of the village as it is today. In 1861, Mr. Steward married and built the first farm house in the location of Steward, which is still standing. The town is located in the west central part of Alto Township and the northeast part of Lee County. Mr. Steward was influential in getting the Chicago and Iowa Railroad, now known as the Burlington Northern, through the township extending from Hinckley, Illinois to Rochelle, Illinois completed in 1870. The Village Hall on Main Street is one of the oldest buildings in existence and the jail cells bought in 1903 and housed in the building are still one of the few reminders of the early <b>days</b> (<b>not</b> <b>used).</b> <b>In</b> 1872 Mr. Steward built the first elevator at the east end of Main Street run by steam. The history of the elevators in Steward over the years is a story in itself. The first house in Steward after the town's formation is on John Street, also standing today, built in 1872.|$|R
40|$|Growing {{concern over}} traffic safety {{as well as}} rising {{congestion}} costs have been recently redirecting research effort from the traditional crash detection and clearance reactive traffic management towards online, proactive crash prevention solutions. In this project such a solution, specifically for high crash areas, is explored by identifying the most relevant real time traffic metrics and incorporating them in a crash likelihood estimation model. Unlike earlier attempts, this one {{is based on a}} unique detection and surveillance infrastructure deployed on the freeway section experiencing the highest crash rate in the state of Minnesota. This state-of-the-art infrastructure allowed video recording of 110 live crashes, crash related traffic events, as well as contributing factors while simultaneously measuring traffic variables such as individual vehicle speeds and headways over each lane in several places inside the study area. This crash rich database was combined with visual observations and analyzed extensively to identify the most relevant real-time traffic measurements for detecting crash prone conditions and develop an online crash prone conditions model. This model successfully established a relationship between fast evolving real time traffic conditions and the likelihood of a crash. Testing was performed in real time during 10 <b>days</b> <b>not</b> previously <b>used</b> <b>in</b> the model development, under varying weather and traffic conditions...|$|R
40|$|Physical polluting {{agents are}} a {{relevant}} problem in urban areas. The need for monitoring and prediction {{of their time}} evolution is very useful {{to assess the impact}} to human health and activities. Considering their effects on health, the most hazardous agents to be considered are air pollution, acoustical noise and electromagnetic fields. Regarding acoustical noise, the complexity of predicting its slope is strongly correlated to its intrinsic randomness, related to the great variability of the sources. Sometimes, in some special areas, the predominant sources are stationary or have a periodic behaviour. In these cases, a time series analysis approach can be adopted, considering that a general trend and a local periodicity can be highlighted and used to build a predictive model. In particular, in this paper, the model is built composing three parts: the trend, that is the long term behaviour, the seasonality, that is the periodic component, and the irregularity, that includes the random variations. Applying such a model to a traffic noise levels dataset, obtained from a site in the city of Messina, Italy, a multiple seasonality is evidenced, resulting in two seasonal coefficients introduction (low frequency and high frequency). The validation of the presented model will be performed on a 44 <b>days</b> dataset, <b>not</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> the calibration. Results will be encouraging and will show a very good prediction performances of the model, especially in terms of difference between observed and simulated values (error). The error distributions will be analyzed and discussed by means of statistical indexes, plots and tests...|$|R
40|$|Every {{consumer}} decision incurs a cost. An hour spent researching {{products is}} an hour not spent working. Vacation days <b>used</b> <b>in</b> the winter are vacation <b>days</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> <b>in</b> the summer. A dollar {{spent on a}} car payment is a dollar not spent dining out. What determines {{the extent to which}} consumers consider such opportunity costs when making decisions? Although every purchase requires an outlay cost (i. e., spending dollars in order to obtain a good), outlay costs only have economic significance because some other good or service must be given up as a result. Consumers have unlimited wants but limited resources, so satisfying one want means not satisfying another (the opportunity cost). An opportunity cost is "the evaluation placed on the most highly valued of the rejected alternatives or opportunities" (Buchanan 2008) or "the loss of other alternatives when one alternative is chosen" (Oxford English Dictionary 2010). Opportunity costs are foundational to the science of economics and, normatively, consumers should account for opportunity costs in every decision they make. I define opportunity cost consideration as "considering alternative uses for one's resources when deciding whether to spend resources on a focal option. " Because consumers face opportunity costs, every purchase decision is effectively a choice among alternative resource uses, not just a decision of whether or not to make a particular purchase. When consumers consider their opportunity costs, alternative resource uses specify the broadest form of competition that products face: each resource use competes for share-of-wallet with all other potential resource uses. Understanding when consumers consider a purchase decision as an allocation across multiple options, and what those considered options are, allows researchers and practitioners to better understand why consumers make the purchases that they do, why they restrain from making the purchases that they do not, and how to influence purchases of focal options by increasing or decreasing consideration of alternative resource uses. What determines when consumers consider opportunity costs? In Essay 1, I propose that consumers consider opportunity costs when they perceive immediate resource constraints. In Essay 2, I propose that consumers consider opportunity costs when the resource <b>in</b> <b>use</b> increases the accessibility of alternative resource <b>uses</b> <b>in</b> memory. Beyond addressing when consumers consider opportunity costs, I address three additional questions. First, who is more likely to consider opportunity costs? Individuals with a high propensity to plan are likely to consider opportunity costs even when they are not immediately constrained. Second, which opportunity costs are consumers more likely to consider? Consumers are more likely to consider opportunity costs that are more typical of the category of possible resource uses than opportunity costs that are less typical of the category of possible resource uses. Third, what are the consequences of opportunity cost consideration? Individuals who consider their opportunity costs are more sensitive to their value than those who do <b>not</b> consider them. <b>In</b> addition to aiding our understanding of the consumer decision process, understanding opportunity cost consideration has important implications for consumers' sensitivities to the structure of the decision environment, understanding the nature of competition and cross-price elasticities, memory for foregone options, and construction of preferences.
