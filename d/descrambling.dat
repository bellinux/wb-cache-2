25|$|In the mid-1980s, {{controversy}} {{erupted in}} the cable programming world as United States media companies that owned pay television channels began scrambling their programming and charging fees to home satellite dish owners who accessed the same satellite signals that cable operators received. Many satellite dish owners faced {{the prospect of having}} to purchase <b>descrambling</b> equipment at a cost of hundreds of dollars, as well as having to pay monthly or annual subscription fees to cable programming providers. Fees for home dish owners were often higher than fees paid by cable subscribers, despite dish owners being responsible for acquiring and servicing their own equipment.|$|E
25|$|SEALAB I {{was lowered}} {{off the coast}} of Bermuda in 1964 to a depth of 192 fsw below the sea's surface. It was {{constructed}} from two converted floats and held in place with axles from railroad cars. Bond and Captain Walter Mazzone inspected the habitat prior {{to the beginning of the}} project. The experiment involved four divers (LCDR Robert Thompson, MC; Gunners Mate First Class Lester Anderson, Chief Quartermaster Robert A. Barth, and Chief Hospital Corpsman Sanders Manning), who were to stay submerged for three weeks. The experiment was halted after 11 days due to an approaching tropical storm. SEALAB I proved that saturation diving in the open ocean was a viable means for expanding our ability to live and work in the sea. The experiment also provided engineering solutions to habitat placement, habitat umbilicals, humidity, and helium speech <b>descrambling.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The Zenith Phonevision system {{became the}} first {{pay-per-view}} system to be tested in the United States. Developed in 1951, it used telephone lines to take and receive orders, {{as well as to}} <b>descramble</b> a television broadcast signal. The field tests conducted for Phonevision lasted for 90 days and were tested in Chicago, Illinois. The system used IBM punch cards to <b>descramble</b> a signal broadcast during the broadcast station's [...] "off-time".

40|$|The {{basic idea}} of {{scrambling}} {{is to change}} the image pixel positions through matrix transform to achieve the visual effect of disorder. Cellular automata can be successfully applied for this purpose. This paper presents digital image scrambling based on two dimensional cellular automata. The proposed scheme is shown high quality of confusion in a few evolution steps. When the original image is compared with the <b>descrambled</b> image by human visual system, it is not recognizable which one is <b>descrambled</b> image and which one is the original image. The paper is organised as follows: first the concept of cellular automata is introduced, and then accordingly the game of life rules and the proposed model followed by the experimental results with discussions...|$|R

A special addressable converter is furnished by the cable company to subscribers of this service. Through the use of special equipment, the cable company can direct the customer's cable box to <b>descramble</b> the program for which the fee was paid.|$|R
50|$|Typical modern cable boxes {{include some}} form of <b>descrambling</b> ability. Such a cable box must also be {{addressable}} (see below) {{in order to be}} told to descramble the signal for a given channel. Early electronic cable boxes, for example, could descramble channels that used inversion as a scrambling method.|$|E
5000|$|SEALAB I was {{commanded}} by Captain George F. Bond, also called [...] "Papa Topside", who was key in developing theories about saturation diving.

50|$|Apart {{from the}} notable {{successes of the}} German navy's {{decryption}} services, there were also some results from the other institutions. For example, the Reichspost was able to descramble scrambled voice transmission of the transatlantic telephone connection between the USA and Great Britain. For this purpose, an interception and <b>descrambling</b> facility was built in Noordwijk, in occupied Holland. From 1940, the Mail Service's <b>descrambling</b> specialists intercepted and understood classified telephone conversation between President Roosevelt and the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. The facility relocated to a purpose built bunker facility in Valkenswaard where it remained until August 1944 when the facility had to relocate to Germany, the interception potential decreased, so did the number of phone calls intercepted. This was not classic codebreaking since none was involved; instead it was the exploitation of knowledge about a sophisticated technology.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are more}} {{advanced}} forms of voice inversion {{which are more}} complex and require more effort to <b>descramble.</b> One method {{is to use a}} random code to choose the carrier frequency and then change this code in real time. This is called Rolling Code voice inversion and one can often hear the [...] "ticks" [...] in the transmission which signal the changing of the inversion point.|$|R
30|$|One of the {{objectives}} of the <b>DESCRAMBLE</b> project (Drilling in dEep, Super-CRitical AMBient of continentaL Europe), funded by the European Commission {{within the framework of the}} H 2020 funding scheme, is to deepen the existing Venelle- 2 well in the Larderello geothermal field in Italy from 2.2  km (and 350  °C) to a depth of 3 – 3.5  km in 2017. As in previous attempts in the 1980 s, the goal is to characterize and test the deep high-temperature resource below the currently exploited reservoir horizons (which is expected to have a temperature of ≈ 450  °C, e.g., Büsing et al. 2016; Liotta and Ranalli 1999; Stamnes et al. 2016). If the initial phase is successful, a pilot plant will be developed. The expectation is that productivities up to ten times those found in standard geothermal wells can be obtained from supercritical resources due to much higher enthalpy fluids. The main research objectives of <b>DESCRAMBLE</b> are to improve drilling and monitoring methods and to develop better ways to physically and chemically characterize deep crustal fluids and rocks (Friðleifsson et al. 2016).|$|R
40|$|CSA is {{utilized}} {{in almost every}} scrambled digital television channel. The MPEG streams are encoded by this using an 8 -byte seed and that is {{needed in order to}} <b>descramble</b> the channels as well. This seed normally is obtained by a second algorithm; this second algorithm can be any common standard for scrambling. This second algorithm is only needed to get the seed for the CSA. This means that if you know the seed, then {{you will be able to}} <b>descramble</b> the any channel. The task becomes finding the seed. This seed is 64 -bit which means there are 10 19 different values. We propose to implement the CSA algorithm using C. We will assume that the seed is not created from another algorithm, but rather, it is given. We plan on using a block cipher to encrypt and decrypt the data. We will create an interface that will enable the user to enter plaintext values and will output encrypted values. This interface will also be able to decrypt encrypted values...|$|R
