40|$|From {{the point}} of view of {{reflection}} signal fidelity, the best way of removing strong regular noise from a common shot gather is to estimate the noise and then subtract it from the data. This minimizes the distortion of the signal. The Karhunen±Loe¡ve (K±L) transform is the basis of such a method, and may be used to extract high-amplitude coherent noise from common shot gathers acquired in seismic reflection surveys on land. In this paper we compare the results of filtering synthetic and real data examples in the frequency±wavenumber (f±k) domain, by <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>velocity</b> filtering in the intercept-slowness (tau-p) domain, and by extracting the noise using the K±L transform. The f±k and <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>velocity</b> filters cause serious distortion of the reflection signals, especially when the difference between the apparent velocities of signal and noise is small. In contrast, the K±L transform enables the noise to be extracted with minimal distortion of the reflection signals. It is a common experience in processing land seismic reflection data to be confronted with data containing weak reflection signals submerged by strong, regular noise such as groundroll or air waves. Although the stack-array approach to the choice of acquisition parameters is a powerful technique for suppressing these types of noise in processed sections, applications such as AVO analysis of the prestack data require that the noise be suppressed with minimum distortion of the reflection signals. For such prestack applications, the choice of filtering method to remove the noise is very important. Other types of source-generated noise, commonly observed in land data, are reverberant refraction events parallel to the first breaks. They are even more difficult to suppress than groundroll and airwaves because their apparent velocities are close to the apparent velocities of the reflection events at far offsets. We show synthetic examples to evaluate the performance of the three filtering methods when the apparent velocities of strong, regular noise are similar to, and different from, the apparent velocities of reflection signals. We then show a real data example which illustrates the superiority of the K±L transform method of noise extraction for suppressing the reverberant refracted arrivals. ...|$|E

The impossibility of using a single lunar flyby to capture a body entering the earth-moon system with a <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>velocity</b> in excess of about 1. 9 km/s is discussed, and a method of using a double flyby of the moon to significantly improve this performance is developed. The equations for achieving a double lunar flyby are derived by solving the orbital equations and Lambert's problem both for the incoming trajectory in the plane of the moon's orbit and for arbitrary declination. For the in-plane case it is shown that the maximum removable hyperbolic excess velocity is 2. 2687 km/s. For the inclined case, it is shown that the use of a double lunar flyby allows capture for declinations in excess of 54 degrees, and that for declinations less than 38 degrees the double lunar flyby offers better performance than the single lunar flyby...|$|E
40|$|Human {{transportation}} systems between Earth and Mars might benefit greatly from {{the construction of}} a tether sling facility on Phobos. A tether sling has the potential to launch vehicles from Phobos to Earth with little or no propellant expended because it is solar powered. For current trajectory designs and tether materials, we show that a tether sling facility is superior to chemical propulsion systems when multiple launches from Phobos are considered. A performance index of the ratio of tether mass to chemical-propellant mass is used to compare various mission scenarios. Ratios less than 10 are considered desirable. The most advantageous application of the tether sling occurs during a Hohmann transfer from Phobos to Earth where the mass ratio is 1. 8. Next are semicyclers (ratios of 1. 9 and 2. 4) and a three-synodic-period cycler (8. 7).

40|$|It {{has become}} {{generally}} recognized that hyperbolic (i. e.

The derivation depends {{on the fact that}} differential displacements on the hyperboloid surface are space-like elements in Minkowski space-time. There is an alternative view of Minkowski space-time regarded projectively as a velocity space. This is best seen by considering differential Minkowski space-time which gives a <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>velocity</b> space with hyperboloid representation. Projection of the hyperboloid to a disc or spherical ball gives an associated Beltrami-Klein representation. These geometrical ideas are important in physics being related to the hyperbolic theory of Special Relativity first proposed by Varicak in 1910 following Einstein's 1905 paper. The Cayley metric for the velocity space leads to relativistic addition of velocities. The paper emphasizes the importance of Weierstrass coordinates in relativity which show the close relation to an equivalent spherical representation where the hyperbolic space is regarded as a sphere of imaginary radius.

40|$|A vehicle {{travelling}} from Earth {{to another}} planet on a ballistictrajectory approaches that planet at <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>velocity.</b> Upon arrival, the vehicle must significantly reduce its speed for orbit insertion. Traditionally, this deceleration {{has been achieved}} by propulsive capture, which consumes {{a large amount of}} propellant. Aerocapture offers a more fuel-efficient alternative by exploiting vehicular drag in the planet's atmosphere. However, this technique generates extreme heat, necessitating a special thermal protection shield (TPS). Performing a trade study between the propellant mass required for propulsive capture and the TPS mass required for aerocapture can help determine which method is more desirable for a particular mission. The research objective of this thesis was to analyze aerocapture dynamics for the advancement of this trade study process. The result was an aerocapture simulation tool(ACAPS) developed in MATLAB with SIMULINK, emphasizing code validation, upgradeability, user-friendliness and trajectory visualization.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study a special {{instance}} of ballistic capture dynamics: {{the case in}} which the capture orbit about a planet experiences a close passage to one or more of its natural satellites. The capability of the satellites in improving ballistic capture is assessed. The dynamical framework considers at least the gravitational attractions of the Sun, the planet, and its satellites, all acting on a massless particle. The effect of the satellites is introduced explicitly by modifying a previously developed method, which relies on three-dimensional stable sets and n-body dynamics with precise ephemeris. Once a stability criterium is defined, initial conditions defined over a computational grid are integrated forward and backward. This allows us to classify orbits into different sets. Ballistic capture orbits with prescribed features are generated by manipulating these sets. Two indices, namely the <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>velocity</b> and the stability index, are used to assess the performance of pre- and post-capture portions, respectively. A Pareto frontier is used to extract orbits of practical interest. Case studies are performed in the context of Earth and Jupiter environments. Comparing to the situation with no moons, the satellite-aided ballistic capture can evidently increase the pre-capture energy and post-capture stability, so making it possible to have permanent capture of a particle at zero-cost.

40|$|The {{stacking}} of long-offset seismic data {{requires a}} nonhyperbolic traveltime function which depends on two-way traveltime, normal moveout velocity and effective anellipticity. Based {{on a standard}} fractional approximation, a new parameterization in slowness squared parameters provides optimal sampling of the normal moveout velocity and anellipticity. The automatic velocity analysis is performed with a normalized bootstrapped differential semblance coherency estimator which works on stochastically scrambled traces within a time window to detect small time shifts thus increasing resolution in velocity spectra. Reflections are identified at the peaks of the maximum bootstrapped differential semblance curve. Centering the reflection pulse within its corresponding time gate results in improved estimate of the two-way time and reduced bias in the estimates of the normal moveout velocity and anellipticity. Generalized Dix equations give estimates of apparent interval thickness, velocity and anellipticity. The interval parameters will fit a homogeneous anisotropic VTI medium or an isotropic layer with a linear velocity gradient. The algorithm outputs an automatic stack and laterally varying moveout velocity and anellipticity maps {{which can be used}} for subsequent time processing.

The spacecraft would use an STR to achieve <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>velocity</b> while {{in the vicinity of}} Earth. A set of calculations estimated the distance from the Sun and flight time of a flyby mission launched from small launch vehicles such as the Pegasus, Taurus and Delta 6920. Rendezvous missions were modeled using solar photovoltaic or radio isotope thermoelectric generators with electric propulsion to make the spacecraft velocity match that of the target object. The Pegasus would send 10 to 25 kg sensor payloads to fly by objects near the ecliptic out as far as Saturn. It could also send a 10 kg payload to rendezvous with most of the known Near Earth Objects (NEOs). The Taurus could send these payloads to fly by Pluto.
