In practice, this timing problem {{does not seem to be}} severe for Dutch pension funds as solvency requirements are only applied to <b>guaranteed</b> <b>pension</b> rights, whereas a major part of pension benefits (indexation) is conditional. Moreover, a fixed interest rate may still be used to calculate pension premiums. Regarding the asset mix, the optimal duration of bonds in portfolio seems higher than currently observed, both under market valuation and under a fixed discount rate method.

40|$|This paper {{begins with}} the issue of pension security, {{referencing}} the desired predictability, stability, long-lived nature of benefits, and coverage of retirement incomes. Also considered is the issue of pension security in the light of global financial market performance and integration. Having discussed issues of nation-state fiscal capacity and the consequences of the technology, media, and telecommunications speculative bubble for stock market returns it is suggested that pension security is also a matter of institutional integrity. This is illustrated with reference to debate in US Congress over the proper response to the Enron debacle. It is argued that no public or private institutions (including the nation-state and large corporations) can now guarantee the final value of pension benefits. As the baby boom generation comes to retirement across the Western world, pension security in the form of <b>guaranteed</b> <b>pension</b> benefit value is a hollow ideal; a chimera on the horizon of nation-state politics that cannot be sustained, notwithstanding the commitment of many to social justice and social solidarity between the generations. ...|$|E

40|$|In an ageing society, {{defined benefit}} (DB) pension plans are {{increasingly}} difficult to manage by means of contribution policy only, as the contribution base is likely to shrink relative to total pension provisions. This development, together with an increased emphasis on market valuation in regulatory and accounting rules, {{has led to a}} switch of DB plans to defined contribution plans throughout the world. In the Netherlands, a different solution has been sought. The typical pension contract nowadays comprises an average earnings DB pension in which only nominal benefits are guaranteed, but with the intention to provide wage or price indexation. In the new supervisory regime, the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>pension</b> rights, based on market valuation, are subject to risk-based solvency requirements. Provisioning is not required for conditional pension rights, although contributions have to be consistent with the indexation ambition. In this paper, we analyse to what extent indexation is indeed likely, given various indexation and contribution policies. Simulations show that voluntary provisioning for indexation is to be recommended. Fully guaranteed indexation is virtually unaffordable under the new supervisory regime, because the real discount rate is generally both very low and highly volatile.

40|$|In the Netherlands, {{the typical}} pension {{contract}} nowadays comprises an average earnings defined benefit pension {{in which only}} nominal benefits are guaranteed, but with the intention to provide wage indexation. In the new supervisory regime, the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>pension</b> rights, based on market valuation, are subject to risk-based solvency requirements.

This paper analyses to what extent indexation is indeed likely, given different indexation and contribution policies. Thereby, it explains how intergenerational risk sharing in defined benefit pension plans can provide a reasonable insurance of pension benefits against wage or price inflation. Moreover, it illustrates the tenability of defined benefit pension plans under ageing, the new fair-value accounting regimes, and possible volatility on financial markets. The analysis is based on a stochastic Pension Asset and Liability Model for the Netherlands (PALMNET). According to the PALMNET simulations, voluntary provisioning for indexation is to be recommended. Without reserving, indexation cuts may be severe and the solvency requirements incidentally lead to extreme premiums. Fully guaranteed indexation is virtually unaffordable under the new supervisory regime, because the real discount rate is generally both very low and volatile.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} pension preferences {{and the effect}} of individual freedom of choice on risk taking in the context of pension arrangements based on a representative survey of about 1000 Dutch citizens. The attitude towards pension schemes and portfolio choices is explained by individual characteristics. Our main conclusions are the following. Risk aversion is domain dependent and highest in the pension domain. The vast majority of respondents is in favour of compulsory saving for retirement and favours a defined benefit pension system. If offered a combined defined benefit/defined contribution system, the majority of the respondents {{would like to have a}} <b>guaranteed</b> <b>pension</b> income of 70 % or more of their net labour income. Self-assessed risk tolerance and financial expertise are important explanatory variables of pension system attitude. Respondents are on average conservative in their investment policy. If given investor autonomy, they are willing to change the composition of their retirement savings portfolio in response to their personal financial situation, general economic conditions, and expectations of financial markets. Respondents may be inconsistent in their preferences. Especially respondents who have chosen a relatively safe portfolio (less stock, more bonds) appear to prefer the retirement income streams of the median investment portfolio to their own portfolio choice. Finally, the average respondent considers himself financially unsophisticated, but is not very eager to take control of retirement savings investment when offered the possibility to increase expertise. ...|$|E

40|$|This project evaluates how workers might {{invest their}} Personal Retirement Account (PRA) funds between safe and risky assets, {{depending}} on whether they are offered a rate of return guarantee on the risky asset. We focus on how asset allocation decisions might differ depending on participants’ attitudes about risk and regret. If, for example, the return on the risky asset {{turns out to be}} very high when a worker retires, he might regret not having allocated a large enough portion of his contributions to the risky asset. On the contrary, if the stock market does poorly, the retiree might regret having invested at all in that asset. We show that anticipated disutility from regret can have a potent effect on investment choices in a PRA. If there is no guarantee, regret induces investors to move away from extreme decisions: that is, investors who take regret into account hold less stock if the risk premium is high, but more stocks if the risk premium is low. Further, a rate of return guarantee provided at no cost to the plan participant induces him to hold more stocks, with or without regret. We also show that, with or without regret, investors' willingness to pay for a guarantee rises with the level of the guaranteed return. This research could be informative regarding the potential profitability of the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>pension</b> business, which would help determine whether a government subsidy would be required to bring these products to market. ...|$|E
40|$|The four {{papers that}} make up my thesis take {{different}} approaches to portfolio choice. The first paper, Expertise Bias, is an empirical paper investigating individuals' portfolio choice. The main finding is that individual investors have an excess weight (according to standard portfolio theory) in stocks related to their expertise. The investigation of this research question is possible due to a unique Norwegian data set that follows all Norwegian citizens. For each individual, the data set contains information that can connect his expertise (e. g. history of employment, experience, education, and wage) with his stock holding (all individual stocks). In addition, the data set includes many socioeconomic and portfolio variables. The next two papers, Optimal Pension Insurance Design and Intergenerational Effects of <b>Guaranteed</b> <b>Pension</b> Contracts, focuson how financial institutions such as life insurance companies, manage individuals' pension savings. Optimal Pension Insurance Design documents that within a standard expected utility framework traditional pension contracts {{are not part of}} the optimal portfolio. However, the demand for the pension products may be explained through behavioral models (e. g. Cumulative Prospect Theory). The third paper documents an intergenerational cross-subsidization effect in guaranteed interest rate life and pension contracts. The subsidy may be large enough to explain why late generations hold guaranteed interest rate products as part of their optimal portfolio allocation. In the last paper I investigate portfolio choice on an even more aggregate level, a country. In Strategic Asset Allocation for a Country, I offer advice on an investment strategy that captures the long-term relationship between the non-tradable assets and liabilities and the financial assets of a country. Instead of using contemporaneous correlation, I apply cointegration and duration matching to identify the long-term relationship between the non-tradable assets and liabilities and the financial assets...|$|E

40|$|In {{accordance}} with the act on the national pension index, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health is to commission {{an evaluation of the}} adequacy of basic social security every four years. An independent expert group is to be appointed for the task and to carry out the assessment autonomously. In April 2014, commissioned by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, the National Institute for Health and Welfare convened the second expert group for evaluation of the adequacy of basic social security, and to conduct the second evaluation of its kind. The second expert group decided to conduct the evaluation by applying the same basic solutions as the first evaluation group did but developed and intensified the evaluation in several aspects. The second evaluation examines the development of the adequacy of basic social security and the factors affecting it from 2011 to 2015. The model family calculations applied in the evaluation have been generated with the new SISU microsimulation model of Statistics Finland. As a rule, the disposable income of households depending on basic benefits (or on low wages) increased between 2011 and 2015, in relation to average wage-earners and in real terms, both before and after dwelling costs. However, during the same period, the real wages of an average-earning household remained essentially at the same level. Persons living alone in rental dwellings and receiving the basic benefits are calculatedly entitled to means-tested basic social assistance. Their income level is determined according to the level of basic means-tested social assistance, and amounts to 43 per cent of the income level of average earners living alone. As the level of <b>guarantee</b> <b>pension</b> is higher than the other benefits, the estimated entitlement to means-tested social assistance is not realised. The income level of single-dweller <b>guarantee</b> <b>pension</b> recipients is 48 per cent of the income level of average earners. In Finland, the income level guaranteed by basic social security is in line with the average level in Western Europe, both before and after housing costs. With the exception of pensioners, the income level of persons relying on basic social security is not adequate to cover reasonable minimum costs determined in reference budgets. In 2014, the income level of unemployed persons, students or sickness allowance recipients living alone in rental housing was enough to cover 71 per cent of reasonable minimum costs. The respective figure for <b>guarantee</b> <b>pension</b> recipients was 102 per cent. The income level of persons on basic social security has increased since 2011 compared with the reference budgets of reasonable minimum costs. Their income level proves to be inadequate when compared with the level deemed adequate by the general public. It amounted to 66 per cent of the monetary sum deemed adequate. The income level of persons on <b>guarantee</b> <b>pension</b> amounted to 85 per cent of the level that the Finnish general public regarded adequate for living. The total number of people living in households completely dependent on basic social security—basic benefits, housing allowances and means-tested social assistance—totalled 231, 000 or 4. 3 per cent of the Finnish population in 2013. The number has increased since 2011. The average duration of total dependence on basic security is four years on average. A total of 71 per cent of households on basic social security benefits are at risk of poverty (the respective percentage for the total population is 13), and 54 per cent report their income to be inadequate (respectively, 25 per cent of the total population). When monitoring the benefits administrated by the Finnish Social Insurance Institution (Kela), the majority, or 64 per cent, of basic benefit recipients are women. Meanwhile, 61 per cent of general housing allowance recipients living alone are men. Further, of all recipients of means-tested social assistance 53 per cent are men. Reforms in benefit and tax legislation during 2011 – 2015 have decreased the Gini coefficient used to measure the income gap by approximately 0. 8 percentage points, and the relative poverty risk by approximately 1. 4 percentage points. Due to legislative amendments, the share of unemployed persons in unemployment traps has increased. Furthermore, the participation tax rate has increased, both regarding the transition from unemployment to full-time work and from part-time to full-time work. 143 pp. Originally published as Perusturvan riittävyyden arviointiraportti 2011 – 2015.
