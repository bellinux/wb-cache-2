500|$|Dworkin also {{submitted}} {{into evidence}} {{a copy of}} Boreman's book Ordeal, {{as an example of}} the abuses that she hoped to remedy, saying [...] "The only thing atypical about Linda <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> had the courage to make a public fight against what has happened to her. And whatever you come up with, it has to help her or it's not going to help anyone". Boreman had testified in person before the Commission, but the Commissioners had not yet seen her book.|$|E
500|$|In a 2002 article, Knight Ridder Newspapers {{characterized}} the book as: [...] "a brave, profane memoir of her escape from childhood abuse into {{the even more}} risky whirl of bright lights, big cities and spiraling self-destruction." [...] A subsequent article in 2003 by Knight Ridder Newspapers wrote: [...] "what makes Dickinson's tome stand out {{from all the other}} Hollywood memoirs <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> a cheeky sense of humor about her self-absorption." [...] Philip Weiss of The New York Observer wrote: [...] "I read No Lifeguard on Duty at once and wasn't disappointed. Janice Dickinson is a funny and fluid narrator." [...] Of the author's path to success recounted in the book, the International Herald Tribune wrote: [...] "Janice Dickinson had a cometlike trajectory as an early supermodel in the 1980s, which she has recounted in her raunchy life story".|$|E

500|$|In the poem, Anactoria is absent, {{though it}} is not evident from the {{surviving}} lines exactly why. [...] One suggestion <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> left Sappho in order to marry. [...] Christopher Brown argues that the description of Anactoria's αμαρυχμα ("the radiant sparkle of her face") is suggestive of the χαρις ("grace", [...] "charm") of a [...] "nubile girl" [...] of marriageable age, and that it is likely that Anactoria has returned to her native city in order to marry. [...] Eric Dodson-Robinson suggests that the poem could have been performed at a wedding, with Anactoria the bride leaving her family and friends. George Koniaris disagrees, arguing that there is [...] "no special reason" [...] to believe that Anactoria left Sappho for a man. [...] Glen Most goes further, saying that {{there is no reason to}} believe that Anactoria's absence was anything more than temporary.|$|E
500|$|Kumar {{described}} his character as [...] "realistic" [...] and a [...] "new-age metrosexual" [...] man. The actor {{revealed that he}} enjoyed {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of his character, adding [...] " [...] is not afraid to show his feelings and does not feel emasculated by his situation." [...] Kumar further stated: [...] "There's a quiet dignity and heroism associated with my character. He doesn't fight for applause. He fights for his convictions." [...] In an interview with Tribune India, Kapoor remarked that Indian women would identify with her character. She said her character [...] "stand by [...] in his moment of distress and helplessness, like every Indian woman would." [...] Chopra described her character Sonia as [...] "charming and focused", commenting that her [...] "philosophy <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> to achieve her goals at any cost. She knows one thing: that nothing can come in between her desires and herself." [...] Owing to her conservative upbringing, Chopra found it difficult to identify with her [...] "man-eater role". Playing an [...] "extremely negative character" [...] proved a challenge, and she had to mentally prepare herself for an hour before each scene.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to gameplay, {{she was also}} one of the first characters to have her backstory fleshed out. In an interview with PC Gamer, the game's creative director, Chris Metzen stated, [...] "Tracer [...] one of the first characters we really got to know. And while she wasn't particularly created to be a starring role, if you will, we felt on the team, the more we got to know her and play her, she was kind of like this Spider-Man type character for us. She's so rad, and it feels good to leverage her in the front of story ideas." [...] Tracer has also been noted for being a peppy character, with Hardcore Gamers Kevin Dunsmore describing her as a [...] "spunky Brit [...] full of little quips as she zips around the battlefield". Kaplan described [...] "Tracer [...] cute and playful, and she's the type of person who does everything with a wink and a smile." [...] In an interview with PCGamesN, game designer Michael Chu stated that [...] "the thing about Tracer <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> a personality which is out of the norm for most people. She is incredibly optimistic, she is incredibly bubbly - it's part of her hero persona. We love her, I think she is very much one of the main characters of the game [...] really carry the torch of what the game is all about: heroism." [...] To reflect her English origin, Tracer is voiced by English actress Cara Theobold.|$|E

2500|$|In a mixed {{review for}} About.com, Mark Edward Nero {{characterized}} the album as [...] "basically one by someone with the persona of a backup player who's been thrust in a lead role." [...] While he praised {{songs such as}} [...] "Work" [...] and [...] "Like This," [...] Nero felt that the album contained too many [...] "weak songs" [...] and that Rowland, [...] "although she may feel comfortable in the role, can't carry the full weight— just like Scottie Pippen never could with the [...] Bulls." [...] Dotmusics Jaime Gill called Ms. Kelly [...] "old-fashioned", writing that [...] "Rowland's big problem <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> the lungs but not the voice [...] She can holler like Beyoncé, growl like Kelis or swoon like Aaliyah, but has little to no natural style of her own." [...] Ken Capobianco's review for The Boston Globe was more emphatic dubbing it [...] "a solid if somewhat safe set of grooves, but the album never takes full flight to become something special." ...|$|E
2500|$|Martin {{continued}} his review in part two, where he lauded {{the writing of}} Sinon's backstory and sufferance of PTSD as [...] "masterful", writing [...] "The way she falls apart even in her Sinon persona {{when faced with a}} particular stressor is quite credible, as is the way she struggles to cope with her crushing fear; she is desperately afraid to die, but even more afraid of living with the fear [...] almost seems like a deliberate message is being sent to the audience, and the way she finally finds her resolve and fights back when her life is in serious jeopardy is heartening." [...] He also praised Michelle Ruff's voice acting in the English dub. Anime News Network's Rebecca Silverman also praised Sinon's portrayal, noting her to be [...] "a much more interesting character" [...] than both Kirito or Asuna, as [...] "what makes Sinon a more successful character than any to previously appear in the main series <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> more depth. Rather than being just a scared or traumatized character, she's someone who is actively working to change herself [...] it feels like this is a turning point for Kawahara's writing skill. Sinon isn't perfectly depicted, but she's got more going on than previous characters." [...] Sam of The Otaku's Study similarly noted how Sinon already established herself as [...] "one of the most developed Sword Art Online characters" [...] despite appearing in only 7 episodes thus far, praising her backstory and contrast between her in-game and out-of-game personas.|$|E
2500|$|After her mother's presumed death, Kiki starts {{building}} {{a relationship with}} Silas. Actress Hayley Erin said [...] "They have a little relationship, and it's sweet" [...] but Silas cannot replace Ava. Kiki really tries to establish that connection with Silas and they do but [...] "She just wishes he were around more." [...] In [...] "losing" [...] Ava, Kiki [...] "lost herself" [...] and resorts to questionable actions such as drugging Michael {{in an attempt to}} make sure he loses custody of their sister. Kiki descends further into turmoil when she finds Silas stabbed to death and believing Franco is guilty she feels [...] "sheer hatred" [...] for him. What makes it most difficult <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> trusted Franco so much. Kiki is very relieved when Franco is proven to be innocent of her father's murder and Ava, who has been passing herself off as Ava's twin is revealed to be alive. Hayley Erin was quite upset by the decision to kill off Silas. [...] "I took it personally" [...] she said. The actress later continued, [...] "But it made for a great storyline {{and there was a lot}} of great material for all of us." [...] Instead of focusing on whether Kiki was aware that Ava was truly alive in her portrayal, Erin went with the most basic off all the emotions with Kiki only being happy to have her mother back. Kiki's glee at having Ava back is ruined when she learns about Ava and Morgan's secret affair. Erin noted the irony of Kiki having Ava for a mother as [...] "the worst thing that could have happened to anyone" [...] while the actress said getting to work opposite Maura West is the [...] "greatest thing that could ever happen to anyone." [...] She continued, [...] "I love it, because she makes me step up my game." ...|$|E

Mr. Mountjoy has been as kind as usual: but he {{has not been able to}} chase away her sadness.
