5|$|Erosion {{threatens the}} island's very existence, it is {{believed}} that it was around eight acres in 1639 before being reduced to 5.70 acres by 1818. By 1987, the total area has fallen to 2.87 acres and it was projected that it could lose another 12 inches each year until <b>it</b> <b>disappears</b> into the sea around 2026.|$|E
5|$|In {{the palace}} garden Armida prepares to kill Almirena. Rinaldo draws his sword, but Armida is {{protected}} from his wrath by spirits. Suddenly Goffredo and Eustazio arrive, {{but as they}} touch the garden with their wands <b>it</b> <b>disappears,</b> leaving them all on an empty plain {{with the city of}} Jerusalem visible in the distance. Armida, after a last attempt to kill Almirena, also disappears as Rinaldo strikes her with his sword. The remaining four celebrate their reunion, while Goffredo announces that the attack on Jerusalem will begin the next day.|$|E
5|$|The {{brightest}} {{star in the}} night sky, Sirius is recorded in the earliest astronomical records. Every year, <b>it</b> <b>disappears</b> for seventy days {{before returning to the}} night sky just before sunrise. Its displacement from the ecliptic causes this heliacal rising to be remarkably regular compared to other stars, with a period of almost exactly 365.25 days holding it constant relative to the solar year. This occurs at Cairo on 19July (Julian), placing it just prior to the summer solstice and the onset of the annual flooding of the Nile during antiquity.|$|E

5|$|The small glaciers in {{the forest}} are less able to resist melting than the great ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. Once a glacier begins retreating, it may fall into disequilibrium and be unable to find mass balance (accumulation versus melting rate) at any size. Without a {{favorable}} climate change, {{it will continue to}} retreat until <b>it</b> <b>disappears.</b> Loss of glacial ice already reduces the summer glacial runoff that supplies water to streams and lakes and provides a cold-water source vital to certain fish and plant species. This, in turn, may {{have a significant impact on}} the forest ecosystem over time.|$|E
5|$|A mountainside, at the magician's cavern. Goffredo and Eustazio {{are told}} by the Magician that Almirena is being held captive in Armida's palace at the mountain-top. Ignoring the magician's warning that they will need special powers, the pair set off for the palace but are quickly driven back by Armida's monsters. The magician then gives them magic wands that transcend Armida's power, and they set off again. This time they {{overcome}} the monsters, but as they reach {{the gates of the}} palace <b>it</b> <b>disappears,</b> leaving them clinging to a rock {{in the midst of a}} stormy sea. They climb the rock and descend out of sight.|$|E
5|$|New {{terrain is}} {{available}} in the game: Wasteland, which impedes the movement of ground vehicles; Ruins, which provide a minor defense bonus for ground units and hiding places in Fog of War; Fire, which is impassable and illuminates the surrounding area during Fog of War; Rough Sea, which impedes the movement of naval units; Mist, which provides a defense bonus and hiding places for naval units; and Meteors and Plasma. Plasma forms an impassable wall that no unit can cross, and is generated by Meteors. Once a Meteor is destroyed, any Plasma in contact with <b>it</b> <b>disappears,</b> allowing units to pass. Plasma that is not in contact with a meteor cannot be destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Methods for {{measuring}} retreat include staking terminus location, global positioning mapping, aerial mapping and laser altimetry. The key symptom of disequilibrium is thinning {{along the entire}} length of the glacier. This indicates a diminishment of the accumulation zone. The result is marginal recession of the accumulation zone margin, not just of the terminus. In effect, the glacier no longer has a consistent accumulation zone and without an accumulation zone cannot survive. For example, Easton Glacier in Washington state, U.S. will likely shrink to half its size but at a slowing rate of reduction and stabilize at that size despite the warmer temperature over a few decades. However, the Grinnell Glacier in Montana, U.S. will shrink at an increasing rate until <b>it</b> <b>disappears.</b> The difference is that the upper section of Easton Glacier remains healthy and snow-covered, while even the upper section of the Grinnell Glacier is bare, is melting and has thinned. Small glaciers with minimal altitude range are most likely to fall into disequilibrium with the climate.|$|E
5|$|Space Race is a two-player arcade game. In the game, the {{two players}} each control a spaceship, which they fly {{from the bottom}} of the screen to the top. Along the way are dashes {{representing}} asteroids moving across the screen from left to right, which the players must avoid. Movement controls are limited to moving the spaceship up or down; if the player's ship is hit by an asteroid <b>it</b> <b>disappears</b> for a few seconds before reappearing at the bottom again. The game displays a starfield in the background, as well as each player's score, which increases whenever a player makes it to the top first. Each game is for a set amount of time, represented by a line in the bottom middle of the screen that shortens during the game, with the winner being the player with the higher score when time runs out. Each game costs a quarter. Machines can be set to play one or two rounds per game, and the time per round is adjustable per machine over a range from 45 seconds to 3 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The Taken are {{protected}} by a shield of darkness, initially rendering them impervious to attack; they can only be injured with a firearm after exposure to light, which burns the darkness away. This puts significant emphasis on flashlights in conjunction with conventional weapons, such as a revolver or shotgun. Flashlight beams act as a reticle. The handheld lights Wake can carry can be boosted, which destroys the darkness faster, but also reduces the light's battery level. Besides the conventional shooter gameplay need for reloading ammunition, the player must also insert fresh batteries into the flashlight when they run out, or {{wait for it to}} recharge slowly. The strength of the darkness protecting an enemy can vary among the Taken. The amount of darkness remaining is represented by a corona of light that appears when aiming at an enemy, and a stronger darkness may recharge over time. When a Taken is finally destroyed, <b>it</b> <b>disappears.</b>|$|E

5|$|Utilising the Game Boy Horror, {{players can}} access {{a map of}} the mansion, seeing which rooms they have visited, what doors are open, and which remain locked. When Luigi finds a key during his explorations, the Game Boy Horror {{automatically}} indicates which door it unlocks. In addition to a map function, the device also keeps track of any treasure that Luigi has found - rooms will usually have treasure hidden within, which can be either coins, gems, gold bars and so forth, hidden within items and even in a chest that appears when the ghosts are cleared out, which Luigi can draw out and then suck up with the Poltergust; if a ghost harms Luigi, he will drop a small portion of collected treasure that he will need to recover before <b>it</b> <b>disappears.</b> After Luigi encounters a group of Boos hiding in the mansion, the device can be used to find each one hiding in a room, through a beeper sound and a flashing yellow light on the device, which turns red when Luigi is close to one; Boos can only be located in rooms that have become lit after their ghosts have been cleared out. Boos are trickier to deal with, as they can plant decoys and traps within objects they can hide in that can fool the Horror, and will escape into other rooms if they can, forcing the player to chase after them.|$|E
