40|$|There are 177 {{waste storage}} tanks {{containing}} over 210, 000 m{sup 3 } (55 million gal) of mixed waste at the Hanford Site. The River Protection Project (RPP) has adopted the data quality objective (DQO) process {{used by the}} U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (EPA 1994 a) and implemented by RPP internal procedure (Banning 1999 a) to identify the information and data needed to address safety issues. This DQO document is based on several documents that provide the technical basis for inputs and decision/action levels used to develop the decision rules that evaluate the transfer of wastes. A number of these documents are presently {{in the process of}} being revised. This document will need to be revised if there are changes to the technical criteria in these supporting documents. This DQO process supports various documents, such as sampling and analysis plans and double-shell tank (DST) waste analysis plans. This document identifies the type, quality, and quantity of data needed to determine whether transfer of supernatant can be performed safely. The requirements in this document are designed to prevent the mixing of <b>incompatible</b> <b>waste</b> as defined in Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 173 - 303 - 040. Waste transfers which meet the requirements contained in this document and the Double-Shell Tank Waste Analysis Plan (Mulkey 1998) are considered to be compatible, and prevent the mixing of <b>incompatible</b> <b>waste...</b>|$|E
50|$|When storing {{chemical}} wastes, {{the containers}} {{must be in}} good condition and should remain closed unless waste is being added. Hazardous waste must be stored safely prior to removal from the laboratory {{and should not be}} allowed to accumulate. Container should be sturdy and leakproof, also has to be labeled. All liquid waste must be stored in leakproof containers with a screw- top or other secure lid. Snap caps, mis-sized caps, parafilm and other loose fitting lids are not acceptable. If necessary, transfer waste material to a container that can be securely closed. Keep waste containers closed except when adding waste. Secondary containment should be in place to capture spills and leaks from the primary container, segregate <b>incompatible</b> hazardous <b>wastes,</b> such as acids and bases.|$|R
40|$|Cyclic potentiodynamic {{polarization}} scans {{were conducted}} to determine the effectiveness of various combinations of anodic inhibitors {{in the prevention of}} pitting in carbon steel exposed to dilute radioactive waste. Chromate, molybdate, and phosphate were investigated as replacements for nitrite, whose effective concentrations are <b>incompatible</b> with the <b>waste</b> vitrification process. The polarization scans were performed in non-radioactive waste simulants. Their results showed that acceptable combinations of phosphate with chromate and phosphate with molybdate effectively prevented pitting corrosion. Chromate with molybdate could not replace nitrite...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{failure to}} {{implement}} corporate strategies {{in general and}} IT strategies in particular can be the reason for lost opportunities, duplicated efforts, <b>incompatible</b> systems, and <b>wasted</b> resources and thus lead to a competitive disadvantage. Empirical works in both domains, business and IT, show {{a number of problems}} that exist in practice. Although, being a major concern of business and IT executives, little research and a lack of methodological guidance to support the execution of decisions and actions exists. Since it is important and reasonable to design a methodological support driven by present problems, this article deduces features to compare approaches to IT strategy implementation found in literature. By combining empirical research and method engineering, the approach is in line with the guidelines of design science. On this foundation, we take the first step towards designing the process model of a comprehensive method to implement IT strategy. ...|$|R
40|$|The Savannah River Site (SRS) has 49 {{high level}} waste (HLW) tanks {{that must be}} emptied, cleaned, and closed as {{required}} by the Federal Facilities Agreement. The current method of chemical cleaning uses several hundred thousand gallons per tank of 8 weight percent (wt%) oxalic acid to partially dissolve and suspend residual waste and corrosion products such that the waste can be pumped out of the tank. This adds a significant quantity of sodium oxalate to the tanks and, if multiple tanks are cleaned, renders the <b>waste</b> <b>incompatible</b> with the downstream processing. Tank space is also insufficient to store this stream given the large number of tanks to be cleaned. Therefore, a search for a new cleaning process was initiated utilizing the TRIZ literature search approach, and Chemical Oxidation Reduction Decontamination [...] Ultraviolet (CORD-UV), a mature technology currently used for decontamination and cleaning of commercial nuclear reactor primary cooling water loops, was identified. CORD-UV utilizes oxalic acid for sludge dissolution, but then decomposes the oxalic acid to carbon dioxide and water by UV treatment outside the system being treated. This allows reprecipitation and subsequent deposition of the sludge into a selected container without adding significant volume to that container, and without adding any new chemicals that would impact downstream treatment processes. Bench top and demonstration loop measurements on SRS tank sludge stimulant demonstrated the feasibility of applying CORD-UV for enhanced chemical cleaning of SRS HLW tanks...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{the program}} to {{disposition}} the tetraphenylborate (TPB) in Tank 48 H and return the tank to service, Salt Processing Development requested {{a review of the literature}} to assess the state of knowledge pertaining to incorporation of tetraphenylborate slurries in saltstone grout with respect to benzene generation rates and leaching performance. Examination of past studies conducted at Savannah River Site (SRS) on the incorporation of TPB slurries in saltstone provides a basis for developing a more focused scope of experimental studies. Tank 48 H currently contains potassium and cesium tetraphenylborate salts as a result of a demonstration of the In Tank Precipitation (ITP) process in 1983 and subsequent ITPradioactive start-up operations in 1995. The tank currently contains approximately 240, 000 gallons of salt solution with approximately 19, 000 kg of potassium and cesium tetraphenylborate salts. The presence of the TPB salts makes the <b>waste</b> <b>incompatible</b> with existing High Level Waste treatment facilities. The TPB salts in Tank 48 H must be treated or removed to meet the scheduled return to service date of 2007. The two preferred options for disposition of the TBP slurries in Tank 48 H include: (1) Aggregation of the material with the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) recycle stream and disposal in the Saltstone Processing Facility (SPF), and (2) In-Situ Thermal Decomposition using heat in combination with pH reduction and catalyst addition. The current literature review along with the current experimental studies provide a basis for determining the feasibility of the option to incorporate the TPB slurries into saltstone grout...|$|R
40|$|Two {{processes}} {{were chosen}} in the 1980 's at the Savannah River Site (SRS) to decontaminate the soluble High Level Waste (HLW). The In Tank Precipitation (ITP) process (1, 2) was developed at SRS {{for the removal}} of radioactive cesium and actinides from the soluble HLW. Sodium tetraphenylborate was added to the waste to precipitate cesium and monosodium titanate (MST) was added to adsorb actinides, primarily uranium and plutonium. Two products of this process were a low activity waste stream and a concentrated organic stream containing cesium tetraphenylborate and actinides adsorbed on monosodium titanate (MST). A copper catalyzed acid hydrolysis process was built to process (3, 4) the Tank 48 H cesium tetraphenylborate waste in the SRS's Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF). Operation of the DWPF would have resulted in the production of benzene for incineration in SRS's Consolidated Incineration Facility. This process was abandoned together with the ITP process in 1998 due to high benzene in ITP caused by decomposition of excess sodium tetraphenylborate. Processing in ITP resulted in the production of approximately 1. 0 million liters of HLW. SRS has chosen a solvent extraction process combined with adsorption of the actinides to decontaminate the soluble HLW stream (5). However, the waste in Tank 48 H is <b>incompatible</b> with existing <b>waste</b> processing facilities. As a result, a processing facility is needed to disposition the HLW in Tank 48 H. This paper will describe the process for searching for processing options by SRS task teams for the disposition of the waste in Tank 48 H. In addition, attempts to develop a caustic hydrolysis process for in tank destruction of tetraphenylborate will be presented. Lastly, the development of both a caustic and acidic copper catalyzed peroxide oxidation process will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Comunicação apresentada na 17 ª Conferência Anual da Network of Intitutes and Schools of Public Administration (NISPA) em Birdua, Montenegro de 14 a 16 dem Maio de 2009. The {{fundamental}} role {{of human}} capital in economical and social success of individuals, organizations and nations is broadly recognized. In {{a context of}} globalization, dominated by innovation, accelerating technological progress and, subsequently, a constantly changing worldwide economy, the awareness of scientists and political decision-makers that competences and skills are an essential factor for both sustainable economic growth and social cohesion has contributed to this recognition. Naturally, investment in human capital is therefore a priority in public policy, mainly {{in the fields of}} education and training. However, this type of investment has not always brought the desired results. When this happens, the deficit in human capital tends to worsen {{due to the fact that}} social demands, in terms of knowledge, are <b>incompatible</b> with the <b>waste</b> of opportunity and public budget. This problem has been the object of concern and analysis by scientists and international organizations. Amongst these, OECD deserves special attention, for carrying out studies and identifying indicators capable of measuring, as objectively as possible, human capital and benefits from investing on it. In terms of training success, one of the most important criteria is the organizational context in which one works, including the consistency between individual and organizational performance. Consequently, training plans must be founded on an ex-ante analysis of human capital competences necessary to the organization and there must be an ex-post analysis, after the training, concerning the results obtained and the contributions of individual competences to the improvement of organizational performance. In the Portuguese Central Public Administration case, evaluation studies on the training cycle demonstrate that current training design and planning practices are casuistic and are not preceded by any needs assessment, which makes the ex-post evaluation impracticable. The purpose of this paper is to overcome this deficiency by providing public organizations a simple, clear and effective methodology to manage competences and training processes, in order to valorize human capital and to improve organizational performance. The developed methodology as been tested on a several number of public organizations in Portugal and consists on a linkage between the strategic goals of public organizations, according to the public policies, and the needed competences in order to achieve that goals...|$|R
