5|$|In {{incidents}} on 18 April, 21 May and 15 December, {{tear gas}} grenades were <b>fired</b> <b>at</b> Rajab's {{house in the}} village of Bani Jamra by unknown assailants. In the first incident, HRW identified the grenades thrown into the Rajab family's compound as US-manufactured munitions to which only Bahrain's security forces would have had access. Tear gas penetrated into the adjacent home of Rajab's 78-year-old mother who suffers from respiratory disease, causing her great distress. On 21 May, four gas grenades were <b>fired</b> <b>at</b> the house. This time, according to Rajab, the grenades were smaller than those used in the mid-April assault and there were no marks identifying the manufacturer.|$|E

5|$|The {{conflict}} between Serbs and Croats spread to eastern Slavonia in early 1991. On 1 April, Serb villagers around Vukovar and other towns in eastern Slavonia began to erect barricades across main roads. The White Eagles, a Serbian paramilitary {{group led by}} Vojislav Šešelj, moved into the Serb-populated village of Borovo Selo just north of Vukovar. In mid-April 1991, Armbrust shoulder-launched anti-tank missiles were <b>fired</b> <b>at</b> Borovo Selo. According to one version of the event, missiles were <b>fired</b> <b>at</b> agricultural machinery that served as barricades. According to a second version, three missiles were <b>fired</b> <b>at</b> houses inhabited by Serbs. There were no casualties, but the attack aggravated and deepened ethnic tensions. On 2 May, Serb paramilitaries ambushed two Croatian police buses in the centre of Borovo Selo, killing 12 policemen and injuring 22 more. Three Serbs were also killed. The Battle of Borovo Selo represented the worst act of violence between the country's Serbs and Croats since the Second World War. It enraged many Croatians {{and led to a}} surge of ethnic violence across Slavonia.|$|E

50|$|The M60 {{is often}} used with its own {{integrated}} bipod or with the M122 tripod.

5|$|Around 02:45, several British destroyers {{mounted a}} torpedo {{attack against the}} rear half of the German line.

But gunners aboard Grosser Kurfürst correctly identified the vessels as hostile and opened fire while turning away to avoid torpedoes, which prompted Markgraf to follow suit. Heavy fire from the German battleships forced the British destroyers to withdraw. At 05:06, Markgraf and several other battleships <b>fired</b> <b>at</b> what they thought was a submarine.|$|E

In response, Australian reconnaissance patrols were increased in order to detect movement into Sarawak, and these would later result in further fighting. Perhaps in retailiation, Indonesian mortars subsequently targeted a number of Australian positions along the border, firing 13 rounds, while a further 25 rounds were <b>fired</b> <b>at</b> 11:00am.

40|$|Currently, {{design codes}} assume {{that in a}} car park <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> most 3 - 4 {{vehicles}} are on <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> the same time.

E. g. a recent <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> Schiphol Airport showed a much faster fire spread and {{a larger number of}} vehicles on <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> the same time than was normally assumed. To understand and predict the fire spread in a car park a, for the time being deterministic, model is being developed based on the effects of the governing radiative heat transfer. With this model it will also be possible to quantify the effects of different relevant parameters...|$|R
