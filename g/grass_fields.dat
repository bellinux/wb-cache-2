A large oak, known as the Gilwell Oak, separates the two fields. The Gilwell Oak symbol is associated with Wood Badge, although the beads for the Wood Badge have never been made of this oak.|$|E
5|$|By 2001 NFF was in {{the process}} of {{implementing}} new stadium requirements in the top leagues, and Briskeby would no longer be permitted to be used in the top tier. Ham-Kam entered an alliance with Totalprosjekt—an real estate development company working on Lillestrøm's Åråsen Stadion—who presented a concept to finance a new venue: The municipality would transfer property to a limited company jointly owned by the municipality and the major sports clubs, the real estate would be re-regulated to increase their value, and the company would use this capital to build a new professional and a new recreational stadium. Parallel with this, a municipal commission made a report that recommended a consolidation in the number of venues in town and the conversion of gravel and <b>grass</b> <b>fields</b> to artificial turf. The commission recommended that a new professional football venue be built either at Briskeby or Hamar stadion.|$|E
5|$|The varsity {{athletics}} {{fields are}} located {{south of the}} College Hill residential neighborhood. Fourteenth Street divides College Hill to the north, with the athletic fields to the south. Charles Boulevard borders the fields {{to the west and}} Greenville Boulevard borders it to the south. A residential neighborhood and Elmhurst Elementary School are the eastern borders. The northern portion of the area sits Dowdy–Ficklen Stadium, Minges Coliseum, and Minges Natatorium, along with parking. The Murphy Center, which is the primary strength and conditioning, and banquet building, is located between Dowdy-Ficklen and Minges Coliseum. The Tennis Complex, Ward Sports Medicine Building, Scales Field House, and the Pirate Club Building also surround Dowdy-Ficklen. The Ward Sports Medicine Building houses offices for football and basketball, Pirate Club, media relations, and the director of athletics. The Scales Field House provides locker rooms, offices and equipment storage. The Pirate Club Building houses a ticket office, other offices, and an area for Pirate Club members. South of those facilities is the Cliff Moore Practice Facility which has a pair of natural <b>grass</b> <b>fields</b> and one FieldTurf field designed exclusively for the football team. On the southern border of the practice facility is Clark-LeClair Stadium, which is the men's baseball stadium. It opened in 2005 and seats 3,000 in permanent seating with another 2,000 located in the outfield. At {{the southern end of the}} fields is the Olympic Sports Complex, which include women's soccer stadium, softball stadium, track and field facility, and Olympic Sports Team building. The Olympic Sports Complex was completed in 2011 with a price of $23.4 million. The Smith-Williams Center is a $17 million basketball development and practice facility, opened in 2013. The football stadium is planning for a $40 million upgrade. The upgrades will include a new press, club, and suite areas, and upper deck, all located on the south side. This addition will increase the capacity from 50,000 to 60,000.|$|E

25|$|During the 1920s the Pretoria Sub-union had not {{foreseen}} {{the growing}} need for fields, {{but in the}} first part of that decade, the Sub-union, in co-operation with the Municipality, systematically put their existing rugby fields under kikuyu. University and Boys' High followed their example in 1923, so that there were seven <b>grass</b> <b>fields</b> available in that year. The Railway Institute field at Berea Park was similarly grassed in 1924. At the end of 1928 there were ten <b>grass</b> <b>fields</b> in Pretoria.|$|E

25|$|Names {{of trees}} or {{plantations}} are also locative surnames, originally related to identifying {{a person who}} lived near or inside a plantation, an orchard or a place with a characteristic kind of vegetation. Names such as Silva and Matos (woods, forest), Campos (<b>grass</b> <b>fields,</b> prairie), Teixeira (a place covered with yew trees), Queirós (a kind of grass), Cardoso (a place covered with cardos, i.e. with cardoons or thistles), Correia (a place covered with corriolas or correas, a kind of plant), Macedo (an apple tree garden), and Azevedo (a forest of azevinho, i.e. a holly wood) fit this pattern.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{artificial}} turf football fields named Nadderud kunstgress, and two <b>grass</b> <b>fields</b> named Nadderudfeltet and Bekkestuabanen respectively. The latter {{has been used}} as a training field by Norway national football team. Between the stadium and the hall is found a tennis court, used by the club Eiksmarka TK. Arena Bekkestua is an indoor venue for skateboarding, rollerblades, BMX and the like (and is also a minor concert hall). As an athletics stadium, Nadderud stadion has no warm-up field, but IL Tyrving operates a field for hammer throw and discus throw adjacent to Bekkestuabanen, because holding these events at Nadderud stadion is not compatible with maintaining a top-level football pitch.|$|E
25|$|Sports {{in general}} are well {{supported}} by the Bathurst community. The Bathurst Regional Council and NSW State Government have contributed significant funds {{over the past decade}} to build new facilities, such as a new heated Aquatic Centre, an Indoor Sports Stadium, Hockey Complex and major upgrade of the track, new pit complex and spectator facilities at the Mount Panorama circuit. The Hockey Complex is an advanced facility which includes water and sand based fields as well as numerous <b>grass</b> <b>fields.</b> Bathurst has had a long association with competitive Hockey at the National level. The city provides dedicated sports facilities for motor racing, Rugby League (part of Group 10), Rugby Union, AFL, Athletics, Cricket, Netball, Tennis, Football and Touch Football. There are over 70 different sporting groups and organisations in the region from the Academy of Dance, croquet, aero, pony clubs, through to the football, rugby, cricket and cycling.

500|$|In 2008 MLSE {{launched}} the TFC Academy youth system to develop soccer players for Toronto FC by {{taking advantage of}} MLS's new homegrown player rule which allows clubs to retain the rights to players they develop without them being subject to the MLS SuperDraft. The senior academy team originally competed in the Canadian Soccer League until pulling out in early 2013 due to the CSL losing its sanctioning from the Canadian Soccer Association. [...] The team played that year in the Ontario Soccer League before joining League1 Ontario for the 2014 season. [...] In November 2014 MLSE announced the establishment of Toronto FC II, their own minor league professional soccer team in the United Soccer League which serves as a reserve team for TFC and a bridge between the Academy. [...] The team began play in 2015 at a newly renovated 2,000 seat stadium, with plans to expand it to 5,000 by 2017, constructed at the Ontario Soccer Centre in Vaughan, just north of Toronto. [...] However, after the expansion did not materialize, which was required to meet the 5,000 seat minimum requirement set by the United States Soccer Federation for the USL to be sanctioned as a division 2 league, the club announced that it would move its home games to BMO Field and Lamport Stadium beginning with the 2018 season. [...] In March 2011 Downsview Park was selected as the site of Toronto FC's new state-of-the-art academy and training facility. Construction began on the KIA Training Ground in May 2011, and the facility opened in June 2012. [...] It includes three <b>grass</b> <b>fields,</b> one domed turf field and a field house. MLSE spent more than $21 million building the facility and pays rent for the land, [...] In July 2014 it was announced that MLSE would expand the training grounds to house a practice facility for the Argos, which would rent the facility from MLSE and practice on a nearby city owned field.

It curves north between exposed rock formations and is promptly surrounded by forests. The undulating highway curves several times {{as it passes}} by the occasional residence or summer cottage. The route curves northeast to avoid a large muskeg. It curves northwest around the muskeg as Arrow Drive, an old alignment of the highway, diverges to the west. After passing back into the forest, it curves to the north.

2500|$|The {{layout of}} Flushing Meadows–Corona Park retains much of Gilmore D. Clarke and Michael Rapuano's Beaux-Arts {{planning}} from the 1939 and 1964 World's Fairs. The northern {{section of the}} park, the former fair grounds, revolves around large paved pathways which during the fairs led to focal points such as pavilions, fountains and sculptures. The Trylon and Perisphere, and later Unisphere, were placed at the main axial point. The Unisphere and Queens Museum currently sit at {{the west end of}} the main promenade. Near the center of the promenade (called Herbert Hoover Promenade on the north side, and Dwight D. Eisenhower Promenade on the south side) are the Fountains of the Fairs, which sit in the median of the paths. At the far east end is the Fountain of the Planets, originally called the Pool of Industry. This layout was used to guide fair goers to exhibits. The layout was based on Gian Lorenzo Bernini's plan for St. Peter's Square in Vatican City. The main promenade, measuring , was provisionally called the [...] "Cascade Mall" [...] during its construction, and later named the [...] "Constitution Mall" [...] during the first fair. Many former exhibit and pavilion sites have since been replaced with soccer fields (artificial turf or dirt and grass), while others have been left as open <b>grass</b> <b>fields.</b>|$|E

It was a favourite suburb with well-to-do persons in the city, rents were high and the builders had long been coveting and trying to get possession of all this land which was [...] "doing no good," [...] in a district where haunts of ancients peace were distinctly out of place and not wanted.

60|$|It was {{the habit}} of the three species named to quit the wood where they roosted {{as soon as it}} was light enough for them to feed, the time varying {{according}} to the state of the weather from half-past eight to ten o'clock, the mornings being usually wet and dark. The rooks that had their rookery in the village numbered forty or fifty birds, and these would remain at the village, getting their food in the surrounding fields for the rest of the day. The daws would appear in a body of two or three hundred birds, but after a little while many of them would go on to their own villages further away, leaving about sixty to eighty birds belonging to the village. Last of all the starlings would appear in flocks and continuous streams of birds often fighting their way against wind and rain, leaving about a couple of hundred or more behind, these being the birds that had settled in the village for the season, and worked in the <b>grass</b> <b>fields</b> in and surrounding it. Rooks and starlings would immediately fall to work, while the daws, the flock breaking up into small parties of three or four, would distribute themselves about the village and perch on the chimney-pots. They would perch and then fly, and for all the rest of the day would be incessantly shifting about from place to place, on the look-out for something to eat, dropping from time to time to snatch up a crust of bread or the core of an apple thrown away by a child in the road, or into a back garden or on to a dust-heap where potato-parings and the head of a mackerel or other refuse had been thrown. They were very bold, but not as courageous as the old-time British kite that often swooped to snatch the bread from a child's hand.|$|E
