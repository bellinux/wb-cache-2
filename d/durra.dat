5|$|To smooth over differences, the revolt's leaders held {{a summit}} in Deir Ghassaneh in September 1938 and {{established}} the Bureau of the Arab Revolt in Palestine as the armed {{body of the}} Central Committee, with al-Hajj Muhammad and Abd al-Raziq rotating as general gommander. The other two commanders on the Bureau were Abu Ibrahim al-Kabir of the Upper Galilee and Yusuf Abu <b>Durra</b> of the Haifa-Wadi Ara region. The British Army, backed by bomber planes, assaulted Deir Ghassaneh after gaining knowledge of the meeting, and sought to arrest or kill the commanders. A battle ensued in which a prominent commander, Muhammad al-Salih (known as Abu Khalid) was slain. Despite the Bureau's formation, the rivalry between al-Hajj Muhammad and Abd al-Raziq continued and undermined its purpose.|$|E
25|$|Yusuf Abu <b>Durra,</b> a Qassamite {{leader in}} the Jenin area, was born in Silat al-Harithiya and before {{becoming}} a rebel worked as a Gazoz vendor. He {{was said to be}} a narrow-minded man who thrived on extortion and cruelty and thus became greatly feared. Yusuf Hamdan was Durra's more respected lieutenant and later a leader of his own unit; he was killed by an army patrol in 1939 and buried in al-Lajjun. <b>Durra</b> himself was apprehended by the Arab Legion in Transjordan on 25 July 1939 and subsequently hanged.|$|E
25|$|In {{parts of}} the rain-fed {{agricultural}} belt of the Sudan, current developments suggest that camels are indeed able to be integrated with crop cultivation systems. They can exploit efficiently the by-products of large-scale mechanized <b>durra</b> (sorghum) cultivation, and may even mitigate some of the ecological side-effects for which these monocropping schemes are known.|$|E
50|$|The first land {{grant in}} the area was made to John Whitehead McNee in 1840 and the name <b>Durras</b> was in use {{at that time to}} {{describe}} the area. For the next ninety years or so, the area was primarily used for timber cutting with a mill in operation at Wasp Head but the mill's closure in 1929 caused a reappraisal of the area's potential. The land south of <b>Durras</b> Creek was subdivided in 1937 to form the village of <b>Durras</b> which didn't become known as South <b>Durras</b> until the establishment of another settlement north of <b>Durras</b> Lake. In the 1940s and 50s, a school, post office and store were established in the town with electricity introduced in 1960.|$|R
50|$|South <b>Durras</b> is a {{small village}} on the South Coast of New South Wales, Australia. South <b>Durras</b> is located {{approximately}} 280 kilometres south of Sydney and 15 kilometres north of Batemans Bay, in the local government area of Eurobodalla Shire. The village is surrounded by the Murramarang National Park.|$|R

25|$|The State {{collected}} tribute {{from the}} {{farmers in the}} form of harvested products like <b>durra,</b> sorghum and bun, and from the nomads, cattle, camels and goats. The collecting of tribute was done by a wazir. Luxury goods imported from foreign lands were also presented as gifts to the Garen rulers by the coastal sultans of the state.|$|E
25|$|Most Rashaida camels in Sudan though are {{generally}} considered to be in good health and excellent condition, doubtless because of the ample availability of feed in the form of <b>durra</b> byproducts. Access to harvested <b>durra</b> fields, however, does not come cheaply. In 1989, to keep 100 camels on sorghum stalks from January to July, owners paid about LSd 50 000 (approximately US$4 000 at that time) and a household normally needs to sell three or four camels to pay for this privilege. Additional problems regularly occur just before the sorghum harvest when it becomes difficult for Sudanese herders to prevent their animals from damaging the crop. This is especially so in dry years when natural forage is quickly depleted, and it requires considerable labor to keep the camels away from the fields. The situation is exacerbated by the frequently random spread of cultivation, which often results in grazing areas being encircled by cultivated fields. Punishments levied against crop damage are harsh.|$|E
25|$|Although Sudan {{has a large}} {{population}} of pastoral nomads, its fertile clay soils in the central plains have caused it {{to be regarded as}} an area of economic potential for the Arab world. With capital from international donors, in the late 1960s a programme was instituted for the large-scale, mechanized cultivation of <b>durra</b> (sorghum). Under this scheme, the Mechanized Farming Corporation leased large plots of land, mostly to urban entrepreneurs and landlords, and provided loans for the purchase of machinery.|$|E

5000|$|According to NSW Primary Industries, {{the basin}} extends through {{approximately}} 350 km of coastline from Newcastle {{in the north}} to <b>Durras</b> Lake (near Batemans Bay) in the south. From <b>Durras</b> Lake the western boundary continues in a line through Lithgow to around Ulan (near Mudgee). To the north the boundary extends 120 km along the Liverpool Range to a point 80 km north of Muswellbrook, and then runs 200 km back to the coast at Newcastle.|$|R
50|$|Prior {{to white}} settlement, South <b>Durras</b> {{was home to}} the Yuin people whose land covered much of the South Coast of New South Wales. Just north of South <b>Durras</b> in the Murramarang Aboriginal Area is what is {{believed}} to be the largest midden on the South Coast. While there was some initial hostility between the Yuin and the white settlers, introduced diseases such as smallpox killed off around 95% of the tribe, leaving them in no state to fight for their land.|$|R
25|$|Since {{the arrival}} of {{mechanized}} farming, the <b>durra</b> stalks which {{appear to be a}} nutritionally adequate type of fodder, have ensured a certain degree of security for the pastoral system. In Sudan, camels are the only domestic animals that can exploit this precarious ecological niche due to their ability to work in extreme temperatures, which can be artificially created by mechanized agriculture. Drinking spots are scarce in the area, and sheep and goats would be unable to move far enough from the few available water sources to utilize the vast expanses of harvested fields. Camels require watering approximately every six days, for which they are usually driven to the Atbara River. Camels are also able to migrate far enough north during the rainy season to utilize the only remaining non-cultivated areas.|$|E
500|$|During {{the early}} days of the 1936â€“39 Arab revolt in Palestine the kibbutz was {{subjected}} to almost daily attacks, usually shootings and burning of forests. The Arabs in the region were under the command of Ahmad Attiyah Awad and after his death in March 1938, the commend was transferred to Yusuf Abu <b>Durra.</b> British High Commissioner Arthur Grenfell Wauchope visited the kibbutz and appointed 15 members as guards and gave them firearms but in August 1936 the situation worsened. The British government sent 60 soldiers to guard the kibbutz and in October the attacks on the kibbutz ended. During the attacks, tens of thousands of trees were burnt. Israeli poet and later member of the Knesset, Uri Zvi Greenberg, criticized the residents of Mishmar HaEmek for not taking the law into their hands after the attacks on their fields and in a poem he wrote on the events he changed the name of the kibbutz from [...] "Mishmar HaEmek" [...] (Guard of the Valley) to [...] "Hefker HaEmek" [...] (Abandonment of the Valley). On 2 February 1938 a member of the kibbutz named Abraham Goldschleger who was a guide for Ein HaShofet was ambushed and murdered by residents of Al-Kafrayn. Two residents of Ein HaShofet who accompanied him were also killed in the attack. One of the shooters was caught and executed. The Palmach (an elite force of the Jewish Haganah underground organization) used the trees in the nearby forest as cover for their main training camp and its fighters worked in the kibbutz.|$|E

Although the judge made the latter suggestion in jest, the woman did go to one of Abu <b>Durra's</b> courts in Ein al-Sahala with the suspects' names; one week later she was summoned back to the court, where her jewelry was restored to her.|$|R
