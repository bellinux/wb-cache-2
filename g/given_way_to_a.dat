5|$|After the 1920s, {{however, the}} church no longer {{required}} affirmation of these beliefs, allowing toleration for alternative {{interpretations of the}} Confession. By the 1940s, the dominance of liberal theology had <b>given</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> neo-orthodox consensus within PCUSA seminaries, and this consensus would be maintained up to the 1958 merger. As a reaction against liberalism, neo-orthodoxy was characterized by an emphasis on divine transcendence rather than divine immanence, renewed affirmation of total depravity, and resistance to secularism and cultural accommodation within the church.|$|E

The four-man starting rotation has <b>given</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> five-man rotation, which gives starting pitchers fewer chances to pick up wins. No pitcher reached 20wins in a non strike-shortened year for the first time in 2006; this was repeated in 2009 and 2017.|$|E
5|$|The road {{remains largely}} {{as it was}} on opening day, though the plants in its median have <b>given</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> steel guard rail, and most {{recently}} to concrete barriers, and it now carries the designation State Route 110, not historic U.S. Route 66. Between 1954 and 2010, it was officially designated the Pasadena Freeway. In 2010, as part of plans to revitalize its scenic value and improve safety, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) restored the original name to the roadway. All the bridges built during parkway construction remain, as do four older bridges that crossed the Arroyo Seco before the 1930s. The Arroyo Seco Parkway is designated a State Scenic Highway, National Civil Engineering Landmark, and National Scenic Byway. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2011.|$|E

25|$|By the 1820s, Gluckian {{influence}} in France had <b>given</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> taste for Italian bel canto, {{especially after the}} arrival of Rossini in Paris. Rossini's Guillaume Tell helped found the new genre of Grand Opera, a form whose most famous exponent was another foreigner, Giacomo Meyerbeer. Meyerbeer's works, such as Les Huguenots emphasised virtuoso singing and extraordinary stage effects. Lighter opéra comique also enjoyed tremendous success {{in the hands of}} Boïeldieu, Auber, Hérold and Adolphe Adam. In this climate, the operas of the French-born composer Hector Berlioz struggled to gain a hearing. Berlioz's epic masterpiece Les Troyens, the culmination of the Gluckian tradition, was not given a full performance for almost a hundred years.|$|E

25|$|Hoffman was 52 at {{the time}} of his death on April 12, 1989, which was caused by {{swallowing}} 150 phenobarbital tablets and liquor. He had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 1980. At the time he had recently changed treatment medications and was reportedly depressed when his 83-year-old mother was diagnosed with cancer (she died in 1996 at the age of 90). Some close to Hoffman, including his longtime friend David Denton and fellow Chicago Seven co-defendant Tom Hayden, claimed that as a natural prankster who valued youth, he was also unhappy about reaching middle age, combined with the fact that the ideas of the 1960s had <b>given</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> conservative backlash in the 1980s. In 1984 he had expressed dismay that the current generation of young people were not as interested in protesting and social activism as youth had been during the 1960s. Hoffman's body was found in his apartment in a converted turkey coop on Sugan Road in Solebury Township, near New Hope, Pennsylvania. At the time of his death, he was surrounded by about 200 pages of his own handwritten notes, many about his own moods.|$|E

500|$|In 1968, in {{testimony}} before Congress, Shoup made {{many of the}} same points as he had in his 1966 speech, saying he felt opposition to the war had likely increased since then. In April 1969, along with retired Colonel James Donovan, he broadened his criticism to national security policy. In an article published in Atlantic Monthly, he accused America of becoming militaristic and aggressive, and was a country ready to [...] "execute military contingency plans and to seek military solutions to problems of political disorder and potential Communist threats in areas of our interest." [...] He said that anticommunism had <b>given</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new, aggressive defense establishment in the United States.|$|E

500|$|Even {{after the}} death of his wife Louisa in 1858, Tucker's {{vitality}} persisted and, not long before the American Civil War began, in January 1861 he journeyed south through Virginia, the Carolinas and Georgia to Alabama to visit a friend in Mobile. In reaction to Georgia's secession from the union, speaking from his lingering southern loyalty, he commented, [...] "it seems a poor remedy for an unpopular President". He thought the overriding need for [...] "a wise provident government" [...] would bring the southern states back under a modified constitution. But after some time spent in the south, he was compelled to say the people [...] "seemed to be crazed in the fancies of imaginary evils and their strange remedies." [...] Indeed, Tucker's youthful loyalties to the agrarian south had in his own maturation <b>given</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> belief in the necessity and value of a commercial-industrial society. Nationalism had become the foundation of his politics over statism, and he could not understand why a compromise in lieu of war would not be embraced.|$|E
500|$|Wark {{agreed to}} a new one-year {{contract}} for the 1992–93 season and was asked to feature in a Sky Sports advertisement to promote the inaugural Premier League competition. Ipswich were the only Premier League club to remain unbeaten after eight games (a sequence that included Wark's first Premier League goal in a 1–1 draw with Tottenham Hotspur). Ipswich went fourth in February and {{there was talk of}} finally winning that title that had eluded them more than once during Wark's first spell there, but 13 consecutive games without a win resulted a 16th-place finish in the table, just three points above the relegation zone, and only a win {{on the final day of}} the season made sure of their survival. Wark, now aged 37, secured yet another one-year contract shortly before the end of the 1993–94 season. Ipswich were saved from relegation in the last round of matches (for the second season running, another good start had <b>given</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> late season slump), courtesy of an injury time winning goal scored by Mark Stein of Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, which ensured that Ipswich's fellow strugglers Sheffield United went down. [...] Wark went on to be voted the club's Player of the Year for a record fourth time.|$|E
500|$|A {{striking}} {{feature of}} many of these alleged borrowings from Beethoven is that they retain, in their borrowed state, the same structural position they had in Beethoven's original design – they appear in the same movements, at the same structural points. However, despite all this evidence in support of Schubert's borrowing from Beethoven, [...] "he evokes the memory of Beethoven and the classical style, but is no docile follower", as Alfred Brendel points out. [...] "On the contrary, his familiarity with Beethoven's works taught him to be different... Schubert relates to Beethoven, he reacts to him, but he follows him hardly at all. Similarities of motif, texture or formal pattern never obscure Schubert's own voice. Models are concealed, transformed, surpassed". A good example of Schubert's departure from Beethoven's line can be found in his most overt quotation of Beethoven – the opening of the Sonata in C minor. Once Schubert's theme has reached A-flat – the highest note in Beethoven's theme – instead of the original, witty cadence in the tonic, Schubert's theme continues to ascend to higher pitches, culminating fortissimo on another A-flat, an octave higher, tonicized as a downward rushing A-flat major scale. From this A-flat major interlude – an evasion of the opening material's harmonic goal, the main generative thematic material for the entire sonata will arise. In this way, what had initially appeared to be a mere note-to-note plagiarism of Beethoven has eventually <b>given</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> radically different continuation, one which invokes Schubert's own, idiosyncratic compositional style.|$|E

2500|$|Starting with Charlemagne, the {{territory}} of modern Germany was {{within the realm of}} the Holy Roman Empire. [...] It was a union of relatively independent rulers who each ruled their own territories. [...] This empire was called in German Heiliges Römisches Reich, with the addition from the late Middle Ages of Deutscher Nation (of (the) German nation), showing that the former idea of a universal realm had <b>given</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> concentration on the German territories.|$|E
