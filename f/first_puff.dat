60|$|Myles Crawford {{blew his}} <b>first</b> <b>puff</b> violently towards the ceiling.|$|E
60|$|Just {{then the}} <b>first</b> <b>puff</b> {{of the coming}} breeze swept up the river, ruffling its {{hitherto}} glassy surface.|$|E
60|$|The fallows and the {{leafless}} trees And all {{my spirit}} tingled. My earliest thought of love, and Spring's <b>First</b> <b>puff</b> of perfume mingled.|$|E
60|$|The {{next minute}} she, {{being open to}} the <b>first</b> <b>puffs</b> of the breeze by a valley, filled and bore away, {{followed}} by the Ostender, who had also set her sails, leaving me becalmed where I was.|$|R
60|$|At the {{distance}} of a hundred fathoms, the dusky line of boats paused, and began to change its order. At that instant the <b>first</b> <b>puffs</b> of the land breeze were felt, and {{the stern of the}} ship made a gentle inclination seaward.|$|R
60|$|At {{that very}} moment the dinghy shot into {{the shadow of the}} fishing-boat. There were two rapid pistol-shots, a scream, and then another pistol-shot, {{followed}} by silence. The clustering fishermen had disappeared. And then, suddenly, as the <b>first</b> <b>puffs</b> of a land-breeze came out from the Sussex shore, the boom swung out, the mainsail filled, and the little craft crept out with her nose to the Atlantic.|$|R
6000|$|... "A regular daisy. Hold up {{your dress}} {{and put your}} hat on straight, it looks sentimental tipped that way and will fly off at the <b>first</b> <b>puff.</b> Now then, come on!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was aware}} of the {{compliment}} and pleased, in that no threat had accompanied my instructions. We were lying head to north-west, and it was his intention to jibe over all with the <b>first</b> <b>puff.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{of no use}} at present, {{but will}} be ready to catch the <b>first</b> <b>puff</b> that may favour us," [...] {{observed}} the old gentleman, as he sat down and took the tiller. [...] "Give way, lads." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{are dead}} men!" [...] cried the captain. [...] "A shout all together, boys, to warn {{them of their}} danger." [...] But it was too late. At that very moment the dinghy shot into {{the shadow of the}} fishing-boat. There were two rapid pistol-shots, a scream, and then another pistol-shot, {{followed}} by silence. The clustering fishermen had disappeared. And then, suddenly, as the <b>first</b> <b>puffs</b> of a land-breeze came out from the Sussex shore, the boom swung out, the mainsail filled, and the little craft crept out with her nose to the Atlantic.|$|R
60|$|Neale saw the <b>first</b> white <b>puff</b> {{of smoke}} from a rifle of the leader. The bullet hit far behind. More shots kept raising the dust, {{the last time}} still a few yards short.|$|R
40|$|Free {{radicals}} in {{cigarette smoke}} {{have been studied}} using spin trapping EPR techniques. 2 R 4 F reference cigarettes were smoked using 35 ml puff volumes of 2 seconds duration, once every 60 seconds. The particulate phase of the smoke was separated from the gas phase by passing the smoke through a Cambridge filter pad. For both phases, free radicals were measured and identified. A range of spin-traps was employed: PBN, DMPO, DEPMPO, and DPPH-PBN. In the gas-phase, short-lived carbon- and oxygen- centered radicals were identified; the ratios between them changed during the smoking runs. For the <b>first</b> <b>puffs,</b> C-centered radicals predominated while for the later puffs, O-centered radicals were mainly observed. The particulate phase and the ‘tar’ were studied as well...|$|R
60|$|Ruby felt so nettled by the {{necessity}} that was laid upon him of taking no notice of Minnie, that he seized {{the handle of}} the bellows passionately, and at the <b>first</b> <b>puff</b> blew nearly all the fire away.|$|E
6000|$|... "They say so. Me own {{feeling is}} that the climate is not to blame. 'Tis age. I'm like a hollow-hearted tree, ready to fall with the <b>first</b> <b>puff</b> of ill wind. I've never been a man since that devil blew me to pieces." ...|$|E
60|$|That evening, {{how happy}} was the party at Hollywell, when Charles put Guy through a {{cross-examination}} on the shipwreck, from the <b>first</b> <b>puff</b> of wind {{to the last}} drop of rain; and Guy submitted very patiently, since he was allowed the solace of praising his Redclyffe fishermen.|$|E
5000|$|Modern [...] "Puffed Rice" [...] is {{attributed}} to an American, Alexander P. Anderson, who, stumbled across [...] "puffing" [...] while trying to ascertain the water content of a single granule of starch, introduced the <b>first</b> <b>puffing</b> machine at the World's Fair in Saint Louis, Missouri, in 1904. His eight [...] "guns" [...] that puffed grains for Fair goers were dubbed [...] "The Eighth Wonder of the World" [...] by an advertising billboard poster. Once the puffing principle, technique and technology had been discovered by Anderson, the competition to puff ready-to-eat American breakfast cereal took over the economy of Battle Creek, Michigan, with Kellogg's and Quaker Oats being two memorable and still active names to endure through the early puffing frenzy.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>first</b> {{full length}} <b>Puff</b> Dragon album - [...] "Sazanami" [...] - was {{released}} on Dakini Records in November 2005.|$|R
60|$|Over {{their heads}} the damp sails fluttered noisily in the <b>first</b> faint <b>puff</b> of the breeze; then, as the airs freshened, the brig tended to the wind, and the silenced canvas lay quietly aback. The mate spoke with low {{distinctness}} {{from the shadows}} of the quarter-deck.|$|R
6000|$|Towards morning, {{while it}} was yet dark, the Red Eric floated, and Captain Dunning, who had paced the deck all night with a {{somewhat}} impatient tread, called to the mate--"Now, Mr Millons, man the boats, and let some of the hands stand-by to trim the sails to the <b>first</b> <b>puff</b> of wind." ...|$|E
60|$|Dick was right, and {{presently}} the <b>first</b> <b>puff</b> of {{the coming}} breeze hit the Dartaway and sent the aircraft up on a slant. Dick promptly moved the tips {{and one of the}} rudders, and the flying machine came along on a level. But from then on the oldest Rover boy had all he could do to keep to the course, for the breeze became stronger and stronger.|$|E
6000|$|... "Such a {{hurricane}} as then blew it is folly to attempt describing. The oldest seaman in Norway never experienced any thing like it. We had let our sails {{go by the}} run before it cleverly took us; but, at the <b>first</b> <b>puff,</b> both our masts went by the board {{as if they had}} been sawed off--the mainmast taking with it my youngest brother, who had lashed himself to it for safety.|$|E
60|$|Stewart {{shook hands}} with some one in the doorway. Then {{he looked up and}} down the road. The door closed behind him. Leisurely he rolled a cigarette, stood close to the wall while he {{scratched}} a match. Even at that distance Madeline's keen eyes caught the small flame, the <b>first</b> little <b>puff</b> of smoke.|$|R
50|$|Marvel Crosson (April 27, 1900 - August 19, 1929) was {{a pioneer}} aviator, and the first female pilot to earn a {{commercial}} license in the Territory of Alaska. She worked in both California and Alaska, dying in a crash during the very <b>first</b> Powder <b>Puff</b> Derby. She {{was inducted into the}} Alaska Women's Hall of Fame in 2011.|$|R
60|$|With the <b>first</b> full <b>puff</b> of {{the smoke}} he gave over his moans and yelps, the {{agitation}} began to fade out of him, and Daughtry, appreciatively waiting, saw the trembling go out of his hands, the pendulous lip-quivering cease, the saliva stop flowing {{from the corners of}} his mouth, and placidity come into the fiery remnants of his eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! well do I know you," [...] muttered Wilder, as the <b>first</b> <b>puff</b> of this unwelcome wind {{struck his}} sails, {{and forced the}} little boat to bend to its power in passing; [...] "well do I know you, with your fresh-water flavour and your smell of the land! Would to God you had blown your fill upon the lakes, without coming down to drive many a weary seaman back upon his wake, and to eke out a voyage, already too long, by your bitter colds and steady obstinacy!" ...|$|E
60|$|DORAN. There was Patsy Farrll in {{the back}} sate wi dhe pig between his knees, n me bould English boyoh in front at the machinery, n Larry Doyle in the road startin the injine wid a bed winch. At the <b>first</b> <b>puff</b> of it the pig lep out of its skin and bled Patsy's nose wi dhe ring in its snout. [Roars of laughter: Keegan glares at them]. Before Broadbint knew hwere he was, the pig was up his back and over into his lap; and bedad the poor baste did credit to Corny's thrainin of it; for it put in the fourth speed wid its right crubeen {{as if it was}} enthered for the Gordn Bennett.|$|E
60|$|All {{hands were}} soon in motion on board le Feu-Follet, the sweeps {{were on the}} point of being handled, when the jigger fluttered and the <b>first</b> <b>puff</b> of the {{expected}} western breeze swept along the surface of the waters. To the seamen it was like inhaling oxygen gas. Every appearance of drowsiness deserted the people of both vessels, and every one was instantly busy in making sail. Raoul had a proof into what dangerous proximity to the frigate he had got by the sound of the calls on board her, and the stillness of the sea was yet so great that the creaking of her fore-yard was actually audible to him as the English rounded in their braces briskly while laying their foretopsail aback.|$|E
50|$|In 1902 Force {{wheat flakes}} {{became the first}} ready-to-eat breakfast cereal {{introduced}} into the United Kingdom. The cereal, and the Sunny Jim character, achieved wide success in Britain, at its peak in 1930 selling 12.5 million packages in one year. In the 1930s, the <b>first</b> <b>puffed</b> cereal, Kix, went on the market. After World War II, the big breakfast cereal companies - now including General Mills, who entered the market in 1924 with Wheaties - increasingly started to target children. The flour was refined to remove fiber, {{which at the time}} was considered to undermine digestion and absorption of nutrients, and sugar was added to improve the flavor for children. The new breakfast cereals began to look starkly different from their ancestors. As one example, Kellogg's Sugar Smacks, created in 1953, had 56% sugar by weight. Different mascots were introduced, such as the Rice Krispies elves and later pop icons like Tony the Tiger and the Trix Rabbit.|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} the results {{on the influence of}} cigarette moisture content to the chemical composition of particulate phase smoke. Seventy-five selected compounds were monitored for the comparison of particulate phase smoke of a commercial full-flavored (FF) cigarette with three different moisture contents at 7. 8 %, 14. 5 % and 20. 4 %, respectively. It was demonstrated that the smoke of a dry cigarette is richer in lower molecular mass compounds than a regular cigarette. On the other hand, the smoke of a moist cigarette is richer in higher molecular mass compounds than a regular cigarette. To maximize the influence of cigarette moisture to the chemical composition, a separate set of measurements were done using only the <b>first</b> three <b>puffs</b> of smoke. The accumulation of moisture in the tobacco column of a burning cigarette may influence the smoke composition, as generated during burning. The differences between dry, regular and moist cigarettes were more obvious for the <b>first</b> three <b>puffs...</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Av coorse it must," [...] {{interrupted}} Larry, who at {{that moment}} was luxuriating in the <b>first</b> rich, voluminous <b>puffs</b> of a newly-filled pipe--"av coorse it must, if it's always like this." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the ship}} which carried the Earl of Evesham's contingent, order and {{discipline}} prevailed. The earl's voice had been heard at the <b>first</b> <b>puff</b> of wind, shouting {{to the men}} to go below, save a few who might be of use to haul at ropes. His standard was lowered, the bright flags removed {{from the sides of}} the ship, the shields which were hanging over the bulwarks were hurriedly taken below, and when the gale smote them the ship was trim, and in readiness to receive it. A few square yards of sail alone were all that the captain had thought it prudent to keep spread, and in a minute {{from the time she was}} struck the lofty hulk was tearing along through the waters at a tremendous speed. Four of the best hands were placed at the helm; and here the captain took his post.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly, as the <b>first</b> <b>puff</b> of {{the night}} wind fanned my cheek, a strange, sweet, low moaning and sighing came to my ears. I almost thought I was in a dream. But the canyon, now blood-red, was there in {{overwhelming}} reality, a profound, solemn, gloomy thing, but real. The wind blew stronger, and then I was to a sad, sweet song, which lulled as the wind lulled. I realized at once that the sound {{was caused by the}} wind blowing into the peculiar formations of the cliffs. It changed, softened, shaded, mellowed, but it was always sad. It rose from low, tremulous, sweetly quavering sighs, to a sound like the last woeful, despairing wail of a woman. It was the song of the sea sirens and the music of the waves; it had the soft sough {{of the night}} wind in the trees, and the haunting moan of lost spirits.|$|E
60|$|After getting round, a sharp {{look-out}} {{was kept}} for the light. We caught another view of it, directly on our weather-beam. From this we inferred {{that the ship}} had more wind than we felt; inasmuch as she had materially altered her position, while we had not moved a mile since we tacked. This was on the supposition that Marble would endeavour to follow {{the movements of the}} ship. At ten, the tempest broke upon us with tropical violence, and with a suddenness that took everybody by surprise. A squall had been expected; but no one anticipated its approach for several hours; and we had all looked for the return of the whale-boat, ere that moment should come. But, come it did, when least expected; the <b>first</b> <b>puff</b> throwing our little schooner down, in a way to convince us the elements were in earnest. In fifteen minutes after the first blast was felt, I had the schooner, under a reefed foresail, and with that short canvass, there were instants, as she struggled up to the summit of the waves, that it seemed as if she were about to fly out of the water. My great concern, however, was for the boat, of which nothing could now be seen. The orders left by Marble anticipated no such occurrence as this tempest, and the concert between us was interrupted. It was naturally inferred among us, in the schooner, that the boat would endeavour to close, as soon as the danger was foreseen; and, as this would probably be done, by running on a converging line, all our efforts were directed to keeping the schooner astern of the other party, in order that they might first reach the point of junction. In this manner there was a chance of Marble's finding the schooner, while there was little of our finding the boat. It is true, we carried several lights; but as soon as it began to rain, even a bonfire would not have been seen at a hundred yards. The water poured down upon us, as if it fell from spouts, occasionally ceasing, and then returning in streams.|$|E
40|$|Respiratory type-IV {{hypersensitivity}} reactions due to corticosteroids {{is a rare}} phenomenon. We describe {{two such}} cases. The first is a 37 - year-old atopic woman who developed labial angioedema and nasal itching after the use of budesonide nasal spray. A month later, after the <b>first</b> <b>puffs</b> of a formoterol/budesonide spray prescribed for asthma, she noticed symptoms of tongue and oropharyngeal itching and redness with subsequent dysphagia, labial and tongue angioedema, and facial oedema. The second is a 15 -year-old non-atopic woman who reported pruritic eruptions around the nostrils after using a budesonide nasal spray. A year later she presented with nasal pruritus with intense congestion and labial and facial oedema after using the same spray. Both patients were evaluated with patch-tests using the commercial T. R. U. E. test, a budesonide solution, and corticosteroid creams. Test evaluation was performed at 48 and 96 hours. In both patients, patch tests were positive to budesonide (++) on the second day. The first patient also had a positive (+) reaction to tixocortol- 21 -pivalate. All the other patch tests were negative. Clinicians {{should be aware that}} hypersensitivity reactions may occur during the use of nasal or inhaled corticosteroids...|$|R
6000|$|At <b>first</b> I <b>puffed</b> vigorously and wastefully, then I became {{scientific}} and sent out rings of smoke so strong and numerous that {{half a dozen}} of them were in the air at a time. In past days I had often followed a ring over the table, across chairs, and nearly out at the window, but that was when I blew one by accident and was loath to let it go. Now I distributed them among my friends, who let them slip away into the looking-glass. I think I had almost forgotten what I was doing and where I was when an awful thing happened. My pipe went out! ...|$|R
60|$|Ten minutes later, {{when they}} were quite close, all {{movement}} was suspended, the advance ceased abruptly, and the quietness that followed was portentous, threatening. Only could be seen the green and gold of the woods, and undergrowth, shivering and trembling to the <b>first</b> faint <b>puffs</b> of the day-wind. The wan white morning sun mottled the earth with long shadows and streaks of light. A wounded man lifted his head and crawled painfully out of the swale, Michael following him with his rifle but forbearing to shoot. A whistle ran along the invisible line from left to right, and a flight of arrows arched through the air.|$|R
