5|$|M. c. ashbyi, {{described}} by Mathews in 1912, is found on Kangaroo Island, {{and has been}} separated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> subspecies for around 9000 years.

Females from Kangaroo Island are more uniformly grey in plumage than mainland birds.|$|E
5|$|Ninox boobook halmaturina {{is found}} on Kangaroo Island.

Miami-Dade County operates four marina parks near the park. Homestead Bayfront Park is directly adjacent {{to the park}} headquarters at Convoy Point.

5|$|According to {{the authors}} of the 2011 genetic study, the close {{relation}} between the King Island and mainland emus indicates that the former population was isolated from the latter relatively recently, due to sea level changes in the Bass Strait, as opposed to a founding emu lineage that diverged <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> emu far earlier and had subsequently gone extinct on the mainland. Models of sea level change indicate that Tasmania, including King Island, was isolated from the Australian mainland around 14,000 years ago. Up to several thousand years later King Island was then separated from Tasmania. This scenario would suggest that a population ancestral to both the King Island and Tasmanian emu was initially isolated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> taxon, after which the King Island and Tasmanian populations were separated. This in turn indicates that the likewise extinct Tasmanian emu is probably as closely related to the mainland emu as is the King Island emu, with both the King Island and Tasmanian emu being more closely related to each other. Fossil emu taxa show an average size between that of the King Island emu and mainland emu. Hence, mainland emus can be regarded as a large or gigantic form.|$|E
5|$|All Saints' Church, Shuart , in the north-west of the Isle of Thanet, Kent, in the {{south-east}} of England, {{was established}} in the Anglo-Saxon period as a chapel of ease for the parish of St Mary's Church, Reculver, which was centred on the north-eastern corner of mainland Kent, adjacent to the island. The Isle of Thanet was then separated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> by the sea, which formed a strait known as the Wantsum Channel. The last church on the site was demolished by the early 17th century, and there is nothing remaining above ground to show that a church once stood there.|$|E

The water tower was built in 1940–41 by the Federal Bureau of Prisons, after the island received a government renovations grant to supply the majority of the island's fresh water.|$|E
5|$|Beginning with County Donegal, Lough Swilly {{separates}} {{one side}} of the Inishowen peninsula. Lough Foyle on the other side, is one of Ireland's larger inlets, situated between County Donegal and County Londonderry. Further round the coast is Belfast Lough, between County Antrim and County Down. Also in County Down is Strangford Lough, actually an inlet partially separating the Ards peninsula <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainland.</b> Further down the coast, Carlingford Lough is situated between Down and County Louth.|$|E
5|$|From 1860 to 1872 forty-three ships had {{collected}} provisions, but from 1873 to 1887 {{there were fewer}} than a dozen. This prompted some activity <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainland.</b> In 1876 a government report on the island was submitted by surveyor William Fitzgerald based on a visit in the same year. He suggested that coffee be grown but the kentia palm was already catching world attention. In 1878 the island was declared a Forest Reserve and Captain Richard Armstrong became the first resident government administrator. He encouraged schools, tree-planting and the palm trade, dynamited the north passage to the lagoon, and built roads. He also managed to upset the residents, and parliamentarian John Wilson was sent <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> in April 1882 to investigate the situation. With Wilson was {{a team of scientists}} that included H. Wilkinson from the Mines Department, W. Condor from the Survey Department, J. Duff from the Sydney Botanical Gardens and A. Morton from the Australian Museum. J. Sharkey from the Government Printing Office took the earliest known photographs of the Island and its residents. A full account of the island appeared in the report from this visit, which recommended that Armstrong be replaced. Meanwhile, the population had increased considerably and included 29 children; the report recommended that a schoolmaster be appointed. This study sealed a lasting relationship with three scientific organisations, the Australian Museum, Sydney Royal Botanic Gardens and Kew Royal Botanic Gardens.|$|E

5|$|In 1891, the New Zealand {{government}} {{set aside}} Resolution Island in Fiordland as a nature reserve. In 1894, the government appointed Richard Henry as caretaker. A keen naturalist, Henry {{was aware that}} native birds were declining, and began catching and moving kakapo and kiwi <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> to the predator-free Resolution Island. In six years, he moved more than 200 kakapo to Resolution Island. By 1900, however, stoats had swum to Resolution Island and colonised it; they wiped out the nascent kakapo population within 6 years.|$|E
5|$|In Ocos, Guatemala {{near the}} border, winds {{from the storm}} {{destroyed}} the roofs {{of about a dozen}} palm huts, forcing over 100 residents to evacuate. The winds also downed hundreds of trees near the coastline. Heavy rainfall from the storm led to river flooding; the island of Ocos was separated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> after the bridge was washed away. Heavy rains along the periphery of the storm triggered significant flooding in El Salvador which killed at least four people.|$|E

The storm destroyed weak shacks made by refugees <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainland,</b> leaving thousands homeless. There were multiple landslides, and most of the infrastructure were damaged. More than 400 small watercraft were either damaged or destroyed. In China, dikes and dams were damaged severely, multiple public buildings collapsed, and destroyed large swaths of farmland. Significant wind and rain was also reported in Taiwan. More than 1,600 people died during the storm.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the bridge}} {{would be the}} only road <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>mainland</b> to the archipelago, tolls could be {{collected}} in only one direction. The tolls were set to NOK40 for semitrailers, NOK30 for buses, NOK20 for trucks, NOK12 for cars, NOK5 for motorcycles, NOK4 for bicycles, NOK2 for adults and 1 for children. Discounts were available at the same rates as for ferries. The four people who had worked the longest on the ferry were offered the job as toll plaza employees. From 1972, the bookkeeping of the company was transferred from the company's secretary to Bergens Privatbank's branch in Sotra, while the auditing was placed at Hordaland County Auditing.|$|E
