40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the <b>in-line</b> <b>transmission</b> of fine transparent alumina in visible light the grain growth during sintering of alumina ceramics was supressed using a combined densification process. This process combines presintering of a green body by spark plasma sintering with final hot isostatic pressing. The presintering by spark plasma sintering provided bodies with a substantially smaller grain size than pressureless presintering. It is shown that the fine-grained presintered microstructure could be retained during final hot isostatic pressing and alumina ceramics doped with spinel and zirconia nanoparticles in particular could be sintered to full density with only minor grain growth during final hot isostatic pressing. The novel combined densification process enhanced by the unique nanoparticle doping approach provided fully dense alumina ceramics with an average grain size of 237 nm and an <b>in-line</b> <b>transmission</b> of 76. 2 % at a wavelength of 632. 8 nm and a sample thickness of 0. 8 mm...|$|E

The sintering process was performed in a radio-frequency furnace under dynamic vacuum. The heating system was efficient to reach temperatures up to 2000 °C with heating rate higher than 100 oC/min. The ceramics were prepared by solid state reaction using ZrO 2 as additive. The maximum temperatures used in all experiments were from 1800 to 1900 °C and soaking time kept between 1 h and 5 h. The optical transmission was measured in the visible-near infrared wavelengths interval and compared to the single crystalline fiber of the same composition, grown by the Laser-Heated Pedestal Growth (LHPG) technique in our labs. X-ray diffraction showed only yttria as single crystalline phase. Thus, all zirconia (up 3 mol%) was incorporated in the ceramic.

Analysis of the experimental findings revealed the production of molecular solutions where IND is homogeneously blended (ascertained by Raman mapping) in the polymer matrices, as it acts as a plasticizer for both hydrophilic polymers. PCA analysis of the recorded NIR signals showed that the screw speed used in HME affects the recorded spectra but not the homogeneity of the embedded drug in the polymer sheets.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{secondary}} ion emission from ultra-thin foils is notably enhanced in the transmission direction. This feature should be of interest for examining nano-objects. A pre-requisite is to deposit them on as thin a support as possible. For this study graphene was chosen. Free-standing graphene was bombarded alone and with deposition of dispersed nanoparticles in a setup enabling bombardment at 0 ? and secondary ion (SI) detection in <b>transmission</b> <b>in-line</b> with the incident projectiles. C^ 1, 2 + 60 and Au^ 4 + 400 at impact energies of ? 0. 4, 0. 8 and 1. 2 keV/atom respectively were used as primary ions. The experiments were run as a sequence of single projectile impacts with each time separate recording of the SIs identified via ToF-MS. In order to improve the understanding of the graphene as a potential quasi-immaterial substrate for the deposition of sub-monolayer nanoparticles, the 1 -layer and 4 -layer graphene were impacted by the individual 25 and 50 keV C^ 1, 2 + 60 projectiles and negative SIs and secondary electrons (SEs) were collected in the transmission direction. The yields of C? n (n ? 4) are above 10 % and decrease exponentially with n. The results are explained with the aid of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The ionization probability was estimated by comparing the SI yields of C? n to the yields of C 0 n from MD simulation. The ions come from the thermally excited rim of the impact hole damped by cluster fragmentation and electron detachment. The SE probability distributions are Poisson-like, and on average 3 thermal electrons are emitted per impact. The interaction of a 2 D projectile on a 2 D target is fundamentally different from that on a 3 D material. 1 -layer graphene was also impacted by the 440 - 540 keV Au 4 + 400 projectiles in both positive and negative ion modes in the transmission direction. The projectiles penetrated the graphene and the Au? 1 ? 3 fragment ions were observed as well as C? n. During the impact, ? 15 % of the initial kinetic energy is lost. The Au projectiles are neutralized when approaching the graphene, and then partially ionized again (positively and negatively) via electron tunneling from the hot rims of the impact hole on graphene. The projectiles obtain an internal energy of ? 500 eV (? 4900 K) after the impact. They undergo a ? 90 step fragmentation with the ejection of Au 1 atoms in the experimental time range of ? 0. 1 ?s. Individual free-standing 5 nm gold nanoparticles coated with dodecanethiol were deposited on graphene film and bombarded with Au^ 4 + 400 and C^ 1, 2 + 60. The graphene substrate contributed few SIs beyond m/z 120, facilitating the detection of moieties attached to the nanoparticles. Compared to reflection SIMS, transmission SIMS shows a ? 4 times higher effective yield of molecular ions from the dodecanethiol coating. The SI yields from Au^ 4 + 400 impact are ? 3 times higher than those from C^ 2 + 60 impact. The yield of the dodecanethiol molecular ion is 1. 0 ? 10 ^? 4 from the Au^ 4 + 400 bombardment and 3. 0 ? 10 ^? 5 from the C^ 2 + 60 bombardment. In this case, assuming the Au nanoparticles are perfectly coated by the dodecanethiol molecules, the limit of detection is ? 5 ? 10 ^ 4 dodecanethiol molecules with Au^ 4 + 400 bombardment...|$|R

Based on digital in-line holography, our transmission microscope achieves a sub-pixel lateral resolution of ≤ 2 µm over a wide field-of-view (FOV) of ~ 24 mm 2 due to its unit fringe magnification geometry.
