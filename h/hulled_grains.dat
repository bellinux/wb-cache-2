50|$|From archeological {{evidence}} at Neolithic sites {{we know that}} there was an early reliance on cereal grains once agriculture had begun. Neolithic peoples used quern-stones to grind the <b>hulled</b> <b>grains,</b> then boiled them to make a kind of porridge. The domesticating of crops is thought to have begun in the Fertile Crescent around 7000 BC. Three of the eight so-called founder crops are cereals - emmer wheat, einkorn wheat, and barley. Rye and oats were cultivated in Europe starting in the early Neolithic in Anatolia before spreading to the rest of Europe in the Iron age and Bronze Age.|$|E
50|$|Glutinous rice {{is known}} as beras ketan or simply ketan in Java and most of Indonesia, and pulut in Sumatra. It is widely used as an {{ingredient}} {{for a wide variety}} of sweet, savoury or fermented snacks. Glutinous rice is used as either <b>hulled</b> <b>grains</b> or milled into flour. It is usually mixed with santan, meaning coconut milk in Indonesian, along with a bit of salt to add some taste. Glutinous rice is rarely eaten as a staple. One example is lemang, which is glutinous rice and coconut milk cooked in bamboo stem lined by banana leaves. Glutinous rice is also sometimes used in a mix with normal rice in rice dishes such as nasi tumpeng or nasi tim. It is widely used during the Lebaran seasons as traditional food. It is also used in the production of alcoholic beverages such as tuak and brem bali.|$|E
40|$|Nakedness in oats is genetically {{controlled}} by a dominant major gene, {{but it is not}} known if all oat varieties trace back to the same origin. To find out if different sources exist, we made crosses between naked oats. Spelt forms in segregating generations can only be expected in case of different origin of the major genes for nakedness in the parents. Starting with 75 crosses the segregating F 2 generation could be obtained for 41 crosses. While 35 crossed yielded only naked oat plants, some spelt oat plants were detected in the remaining six crosses. Two of these crosses, both with the French accession AVE 2841 contained 1 to 2 % plants with <b>hulled</b> <b>grains.</b> Selfed progenies were raised from selected plants of the six crosses. Spelt oat plants were found, and the progenies of plants with clearly <b>hulled</b> <b>grains</b> were nearly uniform for <b>hulled</b> <b>grains,</b> but also segregating progenies with a varying degree of the expression of nakedness were observed. Phenotypic variation also exists in cross progenies between spelt and naked oat. The genetic basis was not the same in the parental naked genotypes. The French accession AVE 2841 carries a different major gene from the German (AVE 1296) and Finnish (AVE 1582). The small percentage of plants with <b>hulled</b> <b>grains</b> supports the hypothesis, that in all parents a dominant major gene for naked grains is responsible. We also found a small percentage of naked grains in selfed progenies from plants with <b>hulled</b> <b>grains</b> explained by minor genes. Seven microsatellites were used in the cross AVE 1296 x AVE 2841 to verify that spelt oat plants were derived from the cross between two naked oat plants. Only F 3 plants were analysed, which themselves yielded <b>hulled</b> <b>grains</b> and had 2 - 3 florets per spikelet. All F 3 plants went back to the cross of the two naked oat parents. Though not impossible, the risk of erratic plants is very low. In the F 2 generation of another cross AVE 1287 (Finland) x AVE 2842 (Germany) only a few plants with spelt oat character were found. Also in this case some F 3 plants with spelt oat phenotype were analysed with five microsatellite markers. But in this case two out of four plants could not be derived from the cross, since they showed foreign alleles for three or four microsatellites. This shows that even with a small number of plants a few microsatellites can be used efficiently to control the genotypes. There is strong evidence that the genetic basis of the French accession AVE 2841 is different from other accessions. vokMyynti MTT tietopalvelu...|$|E
40|$|Wheat with <b>hulled</b> <b>grain</b> is einkorn (Triticum monococcum L), emmer (Triticum dicoccum Schrank) and {{spelt wheat}} (Triticum spelta L).

40|$|In both hulled {{and naked}} oat (Avena sativa L.), {{aberrant}} "fatuoid" plants can occur; {{these can be}} recognized by their prominent twisted and geniculate lemma awns. Fatuoids of hulled oat cannot be used as cultivars because their grain shatters from the plant. In contrast, fatuoids of naked oat do not shatter {{and can be used}} as cultivars. In naked oat, occasional <b>hulled</b> <b>grains</b> may occur, detracting from grain quality and consistency. Some fatuoid lines of naked oat have been observed to produce few <b>hulled</b> <b>grains.</b> Here, we used crosses involving two fatuoid naked oat lines and three nonfatuoid oat cultivars (one hulled and two naked) to study the inheritance of the naked-grained and fatuoid characters. Phenotypic ratios observed in the F 2 generation were not consistent with codominant single-gene models for either character. Dominant single-gene models in which the hulled and fatuoid alleles are recessive, and for which the expression of the dominant gene is variable, were satisfactory in some, but not all, crosses. Within F 2 populations, true-breeding fatuoids could be quite reliably {{selected on the basis of}} the presence of two or more geniculate lemma awns per spikelet, while true-breeding nonfatuoids could be quite reliably selected on the basis of the absence of geniculate lemma awns. In naked oat, fatuoid plants tended to produce fewer <b>hulled</b> <b>grains</b> than nonfatuoid plants, suggesting that the fatuoid condition may enhance the expression of the naked-grained character. Despite the lack of a complete understanding of the genetic control of the naked-grained and fatuoid characters, it should be possible and useful to develop fatuoid naked oat lines for use as cultivars...|$|E

40|$|Based on {{increasing}} use of oats for human nutrition and newly developed processing methods, {{there is a need}} of more detailed defining its grain quality. Varieties with growing characteristics suitable for the given environment and grain quality acceptable for defined end use are assumed to meet requirements of both growers and the processing industry. In 2000 - 2003, 42 hulless varieties from the oat collection were grown in the field in plots of 2. 5 m 2 without replications and evaluated for growing characteristics. After harvest with a combine-harvester, basic parameters of the grain (yield estimation, 1000 -grain weight, volume weight, screening fractions, percentage of <b>hulled</b> <b>grains)</b> were evaluated and nutritional characteristics (content of nitrogen, starch, fat and fibre) were determined using the NIR technique. Results confirmed a high variation in all characters examined. The highest difference between maximum and minimum values in absolute values was found in starch (12. 1), however due to high starch content the variation coefficient was lowest (4. 5 %). The highest variation coefficient was calculated for fibre content (53 %). This value was markedly affected by a generally low fibre content and relatively high occurrence of <b>hulled</b> <b>grains</b> in some materials depending on weather conditions of the year. The nitrogen (respectively starch, fat, and fibre) content in the examined materials varied from 15. 7 to 24. 7 (from 52. 3 to 64. 4, from 2. 9 to 8. 2, and from 0. 2 to 3. 8, respectively), the maximum difference between years was 2. 1 (2. 6, 1. 1, and 1. 0, respectively).

Each of three genotypes responded differently to 2, 4 -D and 2, 4 -D increased hull content in some genotypes. In field experiments, there was usually a higher hull content in samples grown in a cool year than in a warmer year, but in growth cabinets, there was no consistent response to temperature treatments. Groats of <b>hulled</b> <b>grains</b> were smaller than groats of naked grains. Among field grown samples there was an association between the proportion by weight of hull tissue in grain {{and the frequency of}} <b>hulled</b> <b>grains.</b> With gentle threshing in one of two crosses, the naked versus hulled character fit a 3 : 1 ratio, i. e., 3 plants with naked grain or both hulled and naked grain: 1 plant with only hulled grain. With vigorous threshing the 3 : 1 ratio did not fit in either cross. The awned character of the fatuoid condition displayed monogenic inheritance according to a codominant-gene model where the expression of the heterozygote was variable. Expression of the fatuoid character was more variable for F 2 : 3 families derived from naked F 2 plants than for F 2 : 3 families derived from hulled F 2 plants. F 2 and F 2 : 3 plants with two or more awns per spikelet produced higher proportions of naked grain than F 2 plants with fewer than two awns per spikelet.

Our reconstruction involved processing wild barley on the prehistoric threshing floor, followed by use of the conical mortars (a common feature in Natufian sites), thereby demonstrating the efficient peeling and milling of <b>hulled</b> <b>grains.</b> This discovery complements nearly 80 years of investigations suggesting that the Natufians regularly harvested almost-ripe wild cereals using sickles hafted with flint blades.

Zizania seeds are extremely sensitive to drought during the maturing and storage period. This study was conducted to examine the effect of seed water content on genomination in three Zizania species, Z. aquatica, Z. latifolia and Z. palustris that have different morphological grain characteristics. Grain water content in the range of 9 to 83 % showed a positive correlation with germination rate and speed. It was greatly affected by humidity during seed desiccation period. Seed water content was higher in the varieties or strains of larger grains than in those of smaller grains, also, in unhulled than in <b>hulled</b> <b>grains.</b> Seed water content decreased rapidly within 2 weeks of desiccation. Decreased seed water content was closely related to the decreased rapidly within 2 weeks of desiccation. Decreased seed water content was closely related to the decreased germination rate and speed in most Zizania species. Seed germination rate was maintained over 80 % in water content over 35 % in all Zizania species except for Z. latifolia from Sunchon bay that showed very low germination. However, seed germination at water content belo 35 % was significantly different by the seed size but not necessarily by the species. Seed viability of 50 % was observed at 20 % of seed water content in the small grain Z. aquatica from Virginia, while at about 10 - 13 % of water contents in the large grain Z. aquatica Iowa and Z. palustris. Taken together, the results from this study indicate that water content of mature wild rice seeds is a critical factor in germination, and it is affected mainly by humidity during seed maturation. Post-harvest practices to maintain seed water content in the range of 20 to 50 % should improve wild rice seed viability...|$|E
40|$|Rice (Oryza sativa) is the worlds' most {{important}} cereal and potentially {{an important source}} of zinc (Zn) for people who eat mainly rice. To improve Zn delivery by rice, plant Zn uptake and internal allocation need to be better understood. This study reports on within-plant allocation and potential Zn accumulation in the rice grain in four so-called aerobic rice cultivars (Handao 297, K 150, Handao 502 and Baxiludao). Two controlled-condition experiments were carried out, one {{with a wide range of}} constant Zn concentrations in the medium and one with a range of plant growth rate-related supply rates. In both experiments, increased Zn supply induced increased plant Zn uptake rate throughout crop development, when expressed as daily Zn uptake (¿g day¿ 1) or as daily Zn uptake per gram of plant dry matter (¿g g¿ 1). Zinc mass concentration (ZnMC) in all plant organs increased with an increase in Zn supply but to various degrees. At higher uptake levels, the ZnMC in stems increased most, while the ZnMC in <b>hulled</b> <b>grains</b> (brown rice) increased least. The increase in leaf ZnMC was generally small, but at toxic levels in the medium, leaf ZnMC increased significantly. It appears that regulation of grain Zn loading differs from regulation of Zn loading to other organs. A milling test on seeds of Baxiludao and Handao 502 showed that when ZnMC in brown rice increased from 13 to 45 mg kg¿ 1, ZnMC in polished rice grains (endosperm) also increased from 9 to 37 mg kg¿ 1 but remained three to five times lower than that in the bran. Irrespective of the ZnMC in the brown rice, around 75 % of total grain Zn was present in the endosperm. In both cultivars, there was a major difference in ZnMC between bran and endosperm (120 and 37 mg kg¿ 1, respectively), suggesting a barrier for Zn transport between the two tissues. There seems to be a second barrier between stem and rachis, as their ZnMCs also differed greatly (300 and 100 mg kg¿ 1, respectively) in both cultivars at higher plant ZnMC. It is concluded that there is too little scope from a human nutrition perspective to enhance ZnMC in rice endosperm by simply increasing the Zn supply to rice plants because Zn allocation to the endosperm is limited, while observed genotypic differences indicate scope for improvement through breeding...|$|E

40|$|In oat (Avena sativa L.), {{the manner}} by which mature florets {{separate}} from the inflorescence depends on whether the plant is fatuoid or nonfatuoid and on whether it has naked or <b>hulled</b> <b>grain.</b> The anatomical basis for these differences is not well understood. Here, anatomical features were examined {{at the intersection of}} rachilla and lemma callus (disarticulation zone) in florets of fatuoid hulled-grain oat, which "shatter", and of nonfatuoid hulled-grain oat, fatuoid naked-grain oat, and nonfatuoid naked-grain oat, none of which shatter. A layer of one to several rows of small, thick-walled cells usually occurred at the disarticulation zone of fatuoid hulled-grain florets. This layer was less frequently observed at the disarticulation zone of nonfatuoid florets or fatuoid naked-grain florets. Visible at the early stages of development, these rows of small cells apparently form an abscission layer in mature florets of hulled-grain fatuoids. Disarticulation of florets is further assisted by the disintegration of medial parenchyma tissues of the lemma callus, resulting in the formation of lacunae around the vascular bundles. Although a layer of small cells in the disarticulation zone was often seen in mature fatuoid naked-grain florets, it did not function as an abscission layer...|$|R

40|$|Hungry rice (Digitaria exilis) {{has been}} largely {{neglected}} by scientists and plant breeders in the past, but it is now being reappraised. Now that consumers have shown that they value it as a food crop, plant breeders are making use of genetic mutation techniques {{in order to improve}} its performance. Always difficult to process, the potential for hungry, rice may be further improved by a Senegalese invention of a decorticator which avoids the need for pounding. Hungry rice, known also as fonio, fundi, ocha and kabuga, grows only in West Africa in a region of some 300, 000 hectares. Annual production is estimated to be about 100, 000 tonnes. It {{can be used as a}} porridge or added to other cereals as meal. It can also be used as fodder and its stems can be used as a roofing material. Hungry rice will tolerate marginal land and, on poor soil, will grow better than any other crop. In fact farmers say that if nothing else will survive on a particular piece of land, then that is the place to sow hungry rice. Although this plant is one of the most hardy in Africa, it possesses a number of drawbacks. One single grain of hungry rice produces a multitude of stems or tillers and while this could be an advantage in terms of density of seedlings, it presents a problem when it comes to weeding because the stems are so fragile. Further more, the rampant, climbing characteristic of the plant makes harvesting difficult and, in any case, yields are very low indeed. It takes between 1. 6 and 2. 5 million hungry rice grains to make one kilo. At the present time, production is no greater than 150 to 600 kg per hectare. Nevertheless, hungry rice is much sought after. In Mali its price is triple that c>f millet and it is sold at double the price of rice or millet flour. Moreover it's consumption is expanding rapidly in towns, in particular for feast days or ceremonies such as the end of Ramadan. Even though research into this cereal has hardly begun, experts acknowledge that it has exceptional nutritional qualities. In contrast to other cereals where the germ, which is rich in fats, never disappears completely when hulled, the <b>hulled</b> <b>grains</b> of hungry rice contain practically no lipids. This is another reason why interest in this crop is growing among agriculturalists and in June 1994 the Programme for the Promotion of Indigenous Cereals of the Sahel in Bamako, Mali dedicated an international workshop to hungry rice. Improving productivity and processing Scientists have started to improve the plant by subjecting it to the now well-proven technique of irradiation in order to stimulate genetic mutations. The project for domesticating hungry rice is being undertaken by M. Sansan Da at the agricultural research station of Farakoba in the west of Burkina Faso and has been assisted by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) based in Vienna. Although the project has only just begun it is already showing great promise. In order to domesticate such an unimproved plant, it is necessary to modify its genetic characteristics in order to obtain seeds that are more productive and easier to decorticate. This is where irradiation has proved to be important stimulating major disruptions within the chromosomes of the plant and providing plant breeders with a diverse range of new characteristics from which to select the most useful traits. Field trials have been conducted over four years and yields of 2 to 2. 5 tonnes per hectare have been achieved at the agricultural field station at Farakoba. This is a three to four-fold increase over traditional varieties. It seems that despite its reputation for low yields, hungry rice could now achieve the same level of performance as little millet (Panicum sumatrense). Another useful characteristic of the new variety of hungry rice that has been developed by Sansan Da is that it is dehiscent. This means that the husk of the grain has the distinctive characteristic of being slightly open at the top and this tiny detail, visible only with a magnifying glass, is a big step towards the domestication of hungry rice. Unlike other indigenous cereals, traditional landraces of hungry rice have a protective husk to the grain which sticks to it and surrounds it completely. This makes extraction of the germ very difficult and experts think that it is the difficulty of processing hungry rice that makes it so expensive at the market place. With a dehiscent husk, much less energy is required for post-harvest treatment. With a combination of higher yields, improved processing and an already-proven market demand, hungry rice could have a more significant future than might once have been expected.

Further, strong promoter::GUS expression was observed in the palea, lemma and the rachis branches in the young elongating panicles, which supported the role of OsINV 3 in cell expansion and thus, in spikelet size and panicle length determination. Size of the spikelet was found to directly influence the grain weight, which was confirmed {{by the lack of}} differences in weights of <b>hulled</b> <b>grain</b> for differently segregated alleles in the heterozygous lines. Assessment of field grown mutants not only revealed a drastic reduction in the percentage of ripened grain, 1000 -grain weight and final yield, but also significantly reduced partitioning of assimilates to the panicles, whereby the total dry weight remained unaffected. Determination of the non-structural carbohydrate contents revealed a lower hexose-to-sucrose ratio in the panicles of the mutants from panicle initiation to 10  days after heading, a stage that identifies as the critical pre-storage phase of grain filling, whereas the starch contents were not affected. In addition, strong promoter::GUS expression was observed in the dorsal end of ovary during the pre-storage phase until 6  days after flowering, highlighting a function for OsINV 3 in monitoring the initial grain filling stage.|$|R

Medium composition and culture conditions for the acid protease production by Aspergillus niger I 1 were optimized by response surface methodology (RSM). A significant influence of temperature, KH 2 PO 4, and initial pH on the protease production was evaluated by Plackett-Burman design (PBD). These factors were further optimized using Box-Behnken design and RSM. Under the proposed optimized conditions, the experimental protease production (183. 13 UmL− 1) closely matched the yield predicted by the statistical model (172. 57 UmL− 1) with R 2 = 0. 914. Compared with the initial M 1 medium on which protease production was 43. 13 UmL− 1, a successful and significant improvement by 4. 25 folds was achieved in the optimized medium containing (g/L) : <b>hulled</b> <b>grain</b> of wheat (HGW) 5. 0; KH 2 PO 4 1. 0; NaCl 0. 3; MgSO 4 (7 H 2 O) 0. 5; CaCl 2 (7 H 2 O) 0. 4; ZnSO 4 0. 1; Na 2 HPO 4 1. 6; shrimp peptone (SP) 1. 0.

Organic farmers and producers {{have become more}} and more interested in marginal crops such as the tetraploid emmer wheat because of its suitability for organic farming. In spite of its historical role, present distribution of emmer is very limited. The work analyzes the problem of growing possibilities of emmer and its suitability for cultivation in organic farming. In the Czech Republic it is grown only a few farms, but in Austria is more popular now. Possible candidates for the cultivation of emmer has several options about where to obtain a suitable variety. The best option appears to be the choice of legally protected variety Rudico. Another option would be to obtain seed from abroad or multiplication of seed of its own genetic resources. Among important properties of emmer belongs e. g. considerably high resistance to some fungal diseases, which make it advantageous in organic system of growing. <b>Hulled</b> <b>grain</b> requires procedure of peeling. High grain quality, first of all high protein content, predetermines emmer wheat for preparation of healthy dishes in bio quality. The grains are suitable for the production of unyeasted products because of their specific quality. As the emmer wheat is grown especially in the organic farming system, the processing of grains has to respect the individuality of this obsolete cereal species. It may be used for the production of healthy regional food products...|$|R

The relationship between high water temperature and the growth of rice plant was already reported in the previous publication. Then the infuence of high water temperature to a yield of paddy rice was dealt in this paper. The results are as follows: 1. Both culm length and panicle length were dipressed by high water temperature, especially by that of night. The influence of difference water temperature to the weights of a panicle and of panicles per hill was clearly observed (Table 1). 2. Not only weight of a panicle but also a number of panicles per hill were decreased for the plots where water temperature was kept high during night. This, in turn, resulted the increase in weight of panicles per hill (Table 1). 3. The high water temperature at night affected to decrease both the rachis of second order and the number of grains attached to top of them (Table 2. Fig. 1). This attributed a decrease in grain number per panicle. Since the number of panicles was also decreased with the high water temperature at night, total grains per hill were small in number. 4. The percentage of sterile and defective grains was high in the plots where water temperature was kept high at night, while it was remarkable low in the plots where water temperature was varied between day and night (Table 1). 5. As the growth of both palea-and-lemma and endosperm was good in high water temperature at night, the weight of 1000 grains and 1000 hullhd grains was increased and the size of <b>hulled</b> <b>grain</b> became large (Table 5) ...|$|R
