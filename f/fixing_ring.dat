40|$|The {{object of}} this paper is to study the eigenvectors of automorphisms of k[x,y], where k is a field of {{characteristic}} zero. This includes of course the study of the <b>fixed</b> <b>rings</b> of such automorphisms. To the best of our knowledge, the only previous study of this question occurred in [1], where Fraser and Mader showed that for every automorphism o of k[x,y] such that x øcM, yOCM, x ø-xEM 2 and yO _ y E M 2 (where M is the maximal ideal of k[x,y] generated by x and y), the <b>fixed</b> <b>ring</b> of o is either k or k [f] for some irreducible polynomial f. Their work left open the question of whether the case k could actually occur. Our work provides examples (necessarily not of the type considered by Fraser and Mader) of automorphisms for which their result is not true and examples (including some of the type they considered) where the <b>fixed</b> <b>ring</b> is indeed k. Certain of the latter examples also provide examples showing that a natural noncommutative analogue of unique factorization domain does not go up to twisted polynomial rings. We will use the following terminology and results of Lane [2]. An automorphism o ofk[x,y] is triangular if x ø = kx + co(y) yO = #y + v where k,#,v • k and co(y) • k[y]. o is square if it is not conjugate to a triangular automorphism (in other words, if it is not triangular with respect to any choice of indeterminates).

The {{results show that the}} value of external load has a direct pronounced effect on the contact characteristics of journal bearing. There is a significant positive correlation between contact pressure and external load, radius clearance value, and the Young's modulus of material. However, there is an evident negative correlation between contact radius of journal bearing and radius clearance value, and the Young's modulus of material. The smaller radius clearance value of journal bearing is, the more centralized contact region will be, so the corresponding contact pressure will be higher. From the perspective of reducing friction and wear, we need select the materials which have high strength and good toughness. Not only might this can improve the wear resistance, it also effectively decreases the contact pressure. In this case, we can prolong the service life of roller cone drill bits journal bearing...|$|R
