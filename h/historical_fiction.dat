5|$|The medieval setting {{has been}} the {{traditional}} background for epic fantasy. However, where <b>historical</b> <b>fiction</b> leaves versed readers knowing the historical outcome, original characters may increase suspense and empathy for the readers. Yet Martin felt <b>historical</b> <b>fiction,</b> particularly when set during the Middle Ages, had an excitement, grittiness, and a realness to it that was absent in fantasy with a similar backdrop. Thus, he wanted to combine the realism of <b>historical</b> <b>fiction</b> with the magic appeal of the best fantasies, subduing magic in favor of battles and political intrigue. He also decided to avoid the conventional good versus evil setting typical for the genre, using the fight between Achilles and Hector in Homer's Iliad, where no one stands out as either a hero or a villain, {{as an example of}} what he wants to achieve with his books.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} of modern <b>historical</b> <b>fictions</b> by female writers I {{argue that there is}} an "invisible intertext" in women's writing in Ireland that {{challenges}} the tradition discerned by mainstream critics. The mainstream tradition is, in fact, a male tradition and it includes only those <b>historical</b> <b>fictions</b> that inscribe a view of modern Irish history as "the story of the struggle to overcome British domination. " In an extended first section, I examine modern Irish literary and historical discourse to reveal the particular ways that women have been written out. I demonstrate that a major project of mainstream critics and historians has been to explain a "clash of cultures" (Protestant and Catholic). In its insistence that cultural difference has produced distinct literatures, this project has tended to obscure cross-cultural similarities in the lives of women. These similarities, I argue, are evident in women's writing. I demonstrate also that mainstream literary criticism has fused a male-dominated literature to a militaristic history to create a literary canon that excludes female authors. I then compare <b>historical</b> <b>fictions</b> by female authors from Elizabeth Bowen (1929) to Jennifer Johnston (1987) to show that not only do women's texts bear striking similarities to one another (whether the authors are Catholic or Protestant) but also that taken together they challenge the picture of Irish history presented by male authors...|$|R

The film's crossing scene was inspired by Emmanuel Leutze's Washington Crossing the Delaware. The film was praised by critics, but {{the notion that the}} film was purely a <b>historical</b> <b>fiction</b> was lost on some. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

5|$|Although modern fantasy {{may often}} embrace strangeness, the Ice and Fire series is {{generally}} praised {{for what is}} perceived as a sort of medieval realism. Believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre, Martin set out to make the story feel more like <b>historical</b> <b>fiction</b> than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters. Though the amount of magic has gradually increased throughout the story, the series is still to end with less overt magic than most contemporary fantasies. In Martin's eyes, literary effective magic needs to represent strange and dangerous forces beyond human comprehension, not advanced alien technologies or formulaic spells. As such, the characters understand only the natural aspects of their world, but not the magical elements like the Others.|$|E
