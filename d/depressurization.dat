5|$|Foale's Increment {{proceeded}} fairly normally until June 25, when a resupply ship {{collided with}} solar arrays on the Spektr module {{during the second}} test of the Progress manual docking system, TORU. The module's outer shell was hit and holed, which caused the station to lose pressure. This was the first on-orbit <b>depressurization</b> {{in the history of}} spaceflight. The crew quickly cut cables leading to the module and closed Spektr's hatch in order to prevent the need to abandon the station in their Soyuz lifeboat. Their efforts stabilized the station's air pressure, whilst the pressure in Spektr, containing many of Foale's experiments and personal effects, dropped to a vacuum. Fortunately, food, water and other vital supplies were stored in other modules, and salvage and replanning effort by Foale and the science community minimized the loss of research data and capability.|$|E

40|$|AbstractEvery CO 2 {{capture and}} storage chain will contain {{injection}} wells. The most important common operations for wells are shut-ins and <b>depressurizations</b> for reservoir characterization, maintenance stops {{and testing of}} valves. The aim of this work is firstly to demonstrate the need for experiments on these operations. Secondly, a new experimental set-up is proposed for such experiments. The main conclusion from this paper is that the physical phenomena during shut-ins and <b>depressurizations</b> of CO 2 injection wells can be described with models, but that {{that there are still}} some uncertainties left. The largest uncertainties occur when the transient flow is rapid and/or CO 2 is mixed with water. The proposed experimental set-up consists of a well with casing to be drilled vertically 200 - 250 meter at the Statoil laboratory in Trondheim, Norway. A U-tube with two legs with different diameter will be suspended in the well. Moreover, water or brine can be added for observing the effects of the H 2 O-CO 2 interaction. The U-tube is to be linked to the existing CO 2 transport test facility, which has the necessary vessels, compressor and pump. This rig will hopefully contribute in making CO 2 injection wells even safer and more cost efficient...|$|R

50|$|At sea level, {{temperature}} is moderated by the thick atmosphere. As air pressure falls, temperatures can swing more dramatically. Many early manned missions operated at below standard pressure, {{to decrease the}} stresses (and thus, mass) of their capsules. Many did not have separate airlocks, instead exposing the entire cabin to hard vacuum at times. Low pressures also exacerbate contamination issues, as substances acceptable at standard conditions may begin outgassing at lower pressures or higher temperatures. While the Soyuz spacecraft had a 14.7 psi design pressure, and could use its orbital module as an airlock, the orbital module would be deleted for planned lunar missions. In any case, a pen which was insensitive to pressure and temperature would eliminate the issue (including accidental <b>depressurizations),</b> provide a margin, and allow the ability to record during extravehicular activities.|$|R
40|$|A {{probabilistic}} {{fracture mechanics}} (PFM) model that is {{specific to the}} Accelerator Production of Tritium (APT) helium tubes was developed. The model performs Monte Carlo analyses of potential failure modes caused by cyclic stresses generated by beam trips and <b>depressurizations</b> 60 m normal operation, coupled with material aging due to irradiation. Dominant failure probabilities are due to crack through-growth while brittle fracture and ductile tearing have lower probability. Failure mechanisms of global plastic collapse and buckling or crack initiation mechanisms of fatigue or local fracture (upon loss of ductility) have negligible probability. For the population of (7, 311) tubes in the APT blanket, the worst-case, annual probability of one tube failing is 3 percent. The probability of 2 or more failures is substantially lower; therefore, unavailability impacts are driven by single failure. The average annual loss of production (unavailability) is below about 0. 2 percent. Helium outflow and water inflow rates were characterized for the failures...|$|R
40|$|Modeling {{pressurized}} releases in QRA procedures {{is a key}} step {{in obtaining}} a reliable description and prediction of hazards. The application of these procedures to hazards related to CCS and EOR infrastructures poses many problems strictly related to the peculiar thermodynamic behaviour of the CO 2 (Koorneef et al, 2009). Difficulties in the prediction of the discharge behaviour of the CO 2 during rapid <b>depressurizations</b> can influence calculations concerning the atmospheric dispersion and the eventuality of a dry ice bank formation (Mocellin et al., 2015). In order to fill some gaps concerning especially compressible CO 2 discharges, starting from self - collected laboratory scale experimental data, a semi - predictive model is proposed {{with the aim of}} describing a sudden release from a pressurized vessel. The model is based both on conservation equations as well as suitable correlations to give a description of heat - transfer mechanisms. In addition, the Peng - Robinson equation of state is employed in order to predict the CO 2 thermodynamic behaviour and to correctly manage both the gaseous and the dense phase if necessary. The application of the model shows good agreement with the experimental data series, especially in terms of pressure profiles and discharge time. In addition, the vessel thermal dynamics is adequately predicted both for the releases at higher pressure investigated especially when related to an internal surface temperature experimentally derived...|$|R

25|$|The {{formation}} of small particles of a substance {{with a narrow}} size distribution is an important process in the pharmaceutical and other industries. Supercritical fluids provide {{a number of ways}} of achieving this by rapidly exceeding the saturation point of a solute by dilution, <b>depressurization</b> or a combination of these.

40|$|Hanging casing strings {{are used}} for oil and brine {{transfer}} in the domal salt storage caverns of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). Damage to these casings is of concern because hanging string replacement is costly and because of implications on cavern stability. Although the causes of casing damage are not always well defined, many events leading to damage {{are assumed to be}} the result of salt falls impacting the hanging strings. However, in some cases, operational aspects may be suspected. The history of damage to hanging strings is updated in this study to include the most recent events. Potential general domal and local operational and material factors that could influence the tendency for caverns to have salt falls are examined in detail. As a result of this examination, general factors, such as salt dome anomalies and crude type, and most of the operational factors, such as geometry, location and <b>depressurizations,</b> are not believed to be primary causes of casing damage. Further analysis is presented of the accumulation of insolubles during cavern solutioning and accumulation of salt fall material on the cavern floor. Inaccuracies in sump geometry probably make relative cavern insolubles contents uncertain. However, determination of the salt fall accumulations, which are more accurate, suggest that the caverns with the largest salt fall accumulations show the greatest number of hanging string events. There is good correlation between the accumulation rate and the number of events when the event numbers are corrected to an equivalent number for a single hanging string in a quiescent, operating cavern. The principal factor that determines the propensity for a cavern to exhibit this behavior is thought to be the effect of impurity content on the fracture behavior of salt...|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the technique of subslab ventilation (SSV) for limiting radon entry into basements was investigated through complementary experimentation and numerical modeling. Determination {{of the impact of}} subslab aggregate permeability on SSV performance was a primary objective. Subslab pressure fields resulting from SSV were measured in six well-characterized basements, each with a different combination of soil and aggregate permeability. The relationship between air velocity and pressure gradient within the three types of aggregate installed beneath the basement slabs was measured in the laboratory. A new numerical model of SSV was developed and verified with the field data. This model simulates non-Darcy flow in the aggregate. We demonstrate that non-Darcy effects significantly impact SSV performance. Field data and numerical simulations indicate that increasing the aggregate permeability within the investigated range of 2 x 10 {sup - 8 } m{sup 2 } to 3 x 10 {sup - 7 } m{sup 2 } substantially improves the extension of the subslab pressure field due to SSV operation. Subslab pressure field extension also improves as soil permeability decreases between 10 {sup - 9 } m{sup 2 } and 10 {sup - 10 } m{sup 2 }. With a slab-wall gap thickness of 1 mm and the range of aggregate permeability investigated, further reductions in soil permeability do not significantly improve the subslab pressure field extension. Sealing of cracks in the slab and excavation of a small pit where the SSV pipe penetrates the slab also dramatically improve this pressure field extension. A large ratio of aggregate permeability to soil permeability reduces the need for large <b>depressurizations</b> at the SSV pit. Our findings are consistent with the results of prior field studies; however, our understanding of SSV is improved and the dependence of SSV performance on the relevant parameters can now be quantified with the model...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: NASA's {{plans for}} lunar surface {{exploration}} include pressurized suitport rovers that are quickly ingressed and egressed with minimal consumables losses. This capability enables crewmembers to perform multiple short extravehicular activities (EVAs) at different locations {{in a single}} day versus a single 8 -hr EVA. Modeling work and empirical human and animal data indicate that intermittent recompressions between EVA suit pressure and cabin pressure reduce decompression stress. Savings in crew time and gas losses may also be achieved if the N 2 purge is shortened to 2 minutes, achieving 80 % O 2 (vs. 8 minutes, 95 % O 2). METHODS: A validated Tissue Bubble Dynamics Model was used to predict decompression stress using 80 % and 95 % O 2 breathing mixtures during 3 x 2 -hr EVAs (4. 3 PSIA) with 1 hr recompressions back to 8. 0 PSIA (32 % O 2) versus a single 8 -hr EVA. 15 minutes was spent at 6. 0 PSIA before <b>depressurizations</b> to 4. 3 PSIA; initial EVA tasks could be performed during this time. Model validation was based on significant prediction (p< 0. 001) and goodness of fit with 84 cases of DCS in 668 altitude exposures (McFadden s rho-squared= 0. 214). RESULTS: A 2. 2 % predicted increase in DCS risk due to the shortened purge is more than compensated for by a predicted 2. 5 % reduction in DCS risk due to intermittent recompression. 15 minutes at 80 % O 2, 6. 0 PSIA prior to a 4. 3 PSIA EVA prevents supersaturation in the brain and spinal cord (5 - 10 minute half-time compartments) and reduces tissue tensions in 40 min compartments, where most of the body s inert gas is located, to approximately the same levels (4. 39 vs 4. 00 PSIA) as achieved during a 40 min 95 % O 2 prebreathe at 10. 2 PSIA. CONCLUSIONS: Intermittent recompressions between lunar EVAs may enable reductions in suit purge and prebreathe requirements, decompression stress, and/or suit operating pressures...|$|R
25|$|In 2008, NASA {{released}} a detailed report on survivability {{aspects of the}} Columbia reentry. The crew would have had {{less than a minute}} between the beginning of orbiter disintegration and <b>depressurization.</b> The structural failure of the left wing set off alarms in the cabin, although they {{had no way of knowing}} that the wing had broken apart as the rear of the orbiter could not be seen from the cabin. All evidence indicated that the crew frantically tried to regain control of Columbia as it began to spin out of control, but the loss of the left wing caused the orbiter to yaw to the right, exposing its underside to extreme aerodynamic forces and causing total structural disintegration. The crew cabin separated from the rest of the orbiter and rapidly depressurized, which would have killed or incapacitated the astronauts within seconds. Afterwards, the cabin spun around at high RPM, which caused the seat restraints on their upper bodies to fail. They were thus whipped around violently and pummeled by flying and falling objects from the disintegrating cabin, along with their heads and necks being slammed against the helmets, which were not designed to provide any head protection. Even if the cabin had remained structurally intact and reached a lower altitude where air could refill it, the high altitude <b>depressurization</b> would have been fatal to the astronauts unless they received medical attention within 5 minutes, approximately the amount of time it would take between cerebral hypoxia and brain death.|$|E
25|$|A unique {{supersonic}} {{escape capsule}} {{was designed for}} the XF-103. The pilot's seat was located in a shell with a large movable shield in front that was normally slid down into the area {{in front of the}} pilot's legs. In the case of <b>depressurization,</b> the shield would slide {{up in front of the}} pilot, sealing the seat into a pressurized pod. Basic flight instruments inside the capsule allowed the aircraft to be flown back to base, and a window in the front of the shield allowed the periscope system to be used. In an emergency, the entire capsule would be ejected downward, along with a small portion of the aircraft fuselage that provided a stable aerodynamic shape. To enter and exit the aircraft, the ejection module was lowered on rails out of the bottom of the aircraft, allowing the pilot to simply walk into the seat, sit down, and raise the module into the aircraft. The capsule was fully pressurized, allowing the pilot to continue operating the aircraft without a pressure suit when the capsule was locked up.|$|E

40|$|Iodine {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} fission products due to its high fission yield, significant radiobiological hazard and potential volatility. Its environmental and biological risks have been extensively studied in case of a severe reactor accident. Nevertheless, little information is available about iodine behaviour under normal Pressurize Water Reactor (PWR) operating conditions. The work reported explores the behaviour of different iodine species (I−, I 3, I 2, HOI and IO−) during full power periods, transient periods (power reductions and <b>depressurizations)</b> and shutdowns. Thermodynamic calculations were conducted, and their results are compared with previous predictions and with the experimental data provided by nuclear power plants (NPP). Based on thermodynamic calculations and NPP feedback, it was concluded that iodine speciation depends primarily on the redox potential and water radiolysis. * The experimental values confirm that the iodine ionic form I− is the major species during normal operation (I 2 < 2 %) and shutdowns (I 2 < 9 %). * During shutdowns: - High [I 2] (20 - 40 %) can be observed in the presence of fuel failures following an iodine spike during power or pressure variations. The fuel oxidation by radiolysis products can lead to I 2 formation inside the gap and its subsequent release through cladding defects. - Once in the primary coolant, I 2 is transformed into I− or View the MathML source, depending on the water oxidation conditions. * The lithium concentration and the primary coolant temperature seem to have a secondary influence on iodine speciation, while the existence of a redox potential threshold appears to be the main factor controlling the formation of volatile and non-volatile iodine forms. This paper summarizes the major results of the iodine thermodynamic studies and PWR feedback, permitting some possible recommendations for inclusion in the NPP guidelines in order to master iodine's behaviour. Future work is proposed. Redox potential measurements at high temperatures, coupled with thermodynamic estimations and radiolysis analysis, should be considered as useful tools to specify the optimal conditions for limiting iodine volatisation and I 2 absorption...|$|R
