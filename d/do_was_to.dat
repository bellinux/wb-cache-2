5|$|One of the {{strengths}} of Hippocratic medicine was its emphasis on prognosis.

5|$|The {{development}} team {{struggled in}} devising gameplay features {{that would be}} enjoyed by the fans of the series.

Producer Shigeru Miyamoto presented the staff with a variety of opinions which they in turn would have to incorporate into the game the best way possible. Miyamoto let the team decide which graphics they wanted to use without restrictions.|$|E

5|$|Anxious {{for their}} safety Kirill and Victoria decided {{that the best thing}} to <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> leave Russia. They chose Finland as the best {{possible}} place to go. Although a territory of the Russian Empire, Finland possessed its own government and constitution, so in a way it would be like being in Russia and not being at the same time. They had already been once invited to Haikko, a beautiful estate, near Borgå, a small town on the south coast of Finland, not far away from Helsinki. The Provisional Government permitted them to leave, though they were not allowed to take anything of value with them. They sewed jewels into the family's clothing, hoping it would not be discovered by the authorities. They were permitted to board a train without incident {{in the first week of}} June 1917.|$|E
5|$|The marine {{artist and}} Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve officer Norman Wilkinson, agreed with Kerr that dazzle's aim was {{confusion}} rather than concealment, but disagreed about {{the type of}} confusion to be sown in the enemy's mind. What Wilkinson wanted to <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{make it difficult for}} an enemy to estimate a ship's type, size, speed, and heading, and thereby confuse enemy ship commanders into taking mistaken or poor firing positions. An observer would find it difficult to know exactly whether the stern or the bow was in view; and it would be correspondingly difficult to estimate whether the observed vessel was moving towards or away from the observer's position.|$|E
5|$|With William dead, the {{succession}} to the English throne {{was thrown into}} doubt. Rules of succession were uncertain in western Europe at the time; {{in some parts of}} France, male primogeniture was becoming more popular, in which the eldest son would inherit a title. It was also traditional for the King of France to crown his successor while he was still alive, making the intended line of succession relatively clear. This was not the case in England, where the best a noble could <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> identify what Professor Eleanor Searle has termed a pool of legitimate heirs, leaving them to challenge and dispute the inheritance after his death. The problem was further complicated by the sequence of unstable Anglo-Norman successions over the previous sixty years. William the Conqueror had invaded England, his sons William Rufus and Robert Curthose had fought a war between them to establish their inheritance, and Henry had only acquired control of Normandy by force. There had been no peaceful, uncontested successions.|$|E

25|$|The 1778 Treaty of Alliance, {{promising}} {{the defense}} of French territory in the American continent, failed to {{be observed by the}} United States as soon as 1793, when France entered in conflict with Great Britain in the Caribbean. All the U.S. could <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> maintain neutrality, but this neutrality was so negative as to forbid the French the right to equip and arm privateers in American ports, or the right to dispose of French prizes in the United States. These reluctances in effect marked the end of the alliance.|$|E

Labeled a “Social Democrat” instead of being primarily nationalist, La Luz decided instead to become active in Democratic Party politics. He also began a career as an organizer for several unions, which sought to organize the growing Hispanic workforce in the low wage manufacturing and service sectors.

25|$|For many, their {{religious}} beliefs were not even left untouched by the communist influence. Those who practice Buddhism, {{as well as the}} Dali Lama, were not safe from harm at this time.

What the Chinese government had thought to <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> kidnap and harm him. India ended up being the country that provided the safest land for the Tibetans and the Dali Lama who wanted to practice Buddhism in peace and be safe at the same time.|$|E
25|$|Official Soviet figures {{reported}} {{that up to}} one third of urban and two thirds of rural population still held religious beliefs by 1937 (a decrease from estimated 80% of the country being religious in the late 1920s); altogether this made up 50% of the state's population (and even these figures may have been low estimates). However, religion had been hit very powerfully; the number of churches had been reduced from 50,000 in 1917 to {{only a few hundred}} (and {{there was not a single}} church open in Belarus) or perhaps even less, out of 300 bishops in 1917 (and 163 in 1929) only 4 remained (Metropolitan Sergii (the head of the church), Metropolitan Alexii of Leningrad, Bishop Nikolai (Yarushevich), and Metropolitan Sergi (Voskresenski)), out of 45,000 priests there were only to 2,000–3,000 remaining, not a single monastery remained open and the only thing that enthusiasts of atheism could still <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> spy on individual believers and denounce them to the secret police.|$|E

25|$|In ancient China, {{women were}} under-appreciated. This opinion was {{deeply rooted in}} the mind of Lanying’s family. Compared with her little sisters, she was quite lucky because she was the first baby. All of her sisters were sent to be child brides or killed. She was often mistreated and was not allowed to get an education. Before she was 6 years old, Lanying was {{required}} to wash all the clothes and cook for whole family. At age of six, she wanted to go to school because she wanted to escape the traditional pattern for women at her time, which was doing housework and chatting with other women all day. The only way to <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> get an education. However, her mother, who was deeply influenced by gender schema from society and controlled her life, did not allow that. So Lanying locked herself in her room and swore that she would not eat if she was not allowed to go to school. Her mother was moved by her insistence, so she finally got the chance to get an education.|$|E
25|$|The {{main point}} of {{contention}} in the umpiring of the 1974–75 Ashes series was the intimidatory bowling of the Australian fast bowlers Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson. There were a few other issues, though there were the usual cases of batsmen being given out or not out despite the differing opinions of the players and umpire. At the time, umpires had no recourse to slow motion replays and had to {{make decisions based on}} what they saw in a split second, with {{the benefit of the doubt}} always going to the batsman. As a result it was not uncommon for umpires to make mistakes, which over the course of a long series tended to cancel each other out. The best an umpire could <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> make an honest judgement based on what he saw. Tom Brooks and Robin Bailhache were the umpires in all six Tests, but were junior for so important a series. Brooks having made his debut in the 1970–71 Ashes series and Bailhache in the First Test at Brisbane. Unusually for Australian umpires of the time Brooks had played First Class Cricket – he had been a lively fast-medium bowler – and as a result was more able to connect with the Test players, and was more forgiving of short-pitched deliveries which he saw as a natural part of the game. This helped England in 1970–71 when they had the fast bowlers John Snow and Bob Willis, but proved fatal for their batsmen in 1974–75.|$|E
25|$|There {{once took}} place a great {{competition}} between the Devas to decide who among them should {{be the head of}} the Gana (the troops of semi-gods at the service of Shiva). The competitors were required to circle the world as fast as possible and return to the Feet of Parvati. The gods took off, each on his or her own vehicle, and even Ganesha participated with enthusiasm in the race; but he was extremely heavy and was riding on a mouse! Naturally, his pace was remarkably slow and this was a great disadvantage. He had not yet made much headway when there appeared before him the sage Narada (son of Brahma), who asked him where he was going. Ganesha was very annoyed and went into a rage because it was considered unlucky to encounter a solitary Brahmin just {{at the beginning of a}} voyage. Notwithstanding the fact that Narada was the greatest of Brahmins, son of Brahma himself, this was still a bad omen. Moreover, it wasn't considered a good sign to be asked where one was heading when one was already on the way to some destination; therefore, Ganesha felt doubly unfortunate. Nonetheless, the great Brahmin succeeded in calming his fury. Ganesha explained to him the motives for his sadness and his terrible desire to win. Narada consoled and exhorted him not to despair; he said that for a child, the whole world was embodied within the mother , so all Ganesha had to <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> circle his Parvati and he would defeat those who had more speed but less understanding.|$|E
