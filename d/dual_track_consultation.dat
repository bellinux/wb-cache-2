40|$|This study {{presents}} <b>dual</b> <b>tracking</b> {{method for}} real time object tracking using a moving camera. A real time object tracking using self aligning servo mechanism with webcam, <b>dual</b> <b>tracking</b> and effective localization of object is presented. The proposed <b>dual</b> <b>tracking</b> method works in two phases: In first phase tracking {{is done by}} joint color texture histogram with mean shift and in second phase tracking is done by servo setup. The proposed <b>dual</b> <b>tracking</b> method enjoys the benefit of double tracking feature, not only tracking but also {{to find out the}} coordinates of the tracking object which is of particular interest. The coordinates of a moving object enable us to estimates the real time location of the object which is helpful in surveillance and shooting purposes of suspected person in security area. The tracking of some specific objects in real life is of particular interest. Due to its enhanced automation the proposed <b>dual</b> <b>tracking</b> method can be applied in public security, surveillance, robotics and traffic control etc. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed <b>dual</b> <b>tracking</b> method improves greatly the tracking area with accuracy and efficiency and also successfully find the coordinates of moving object...|$|R

40|$|The <b>dual</b> <b>track</b> {{approach}} to market liberalization {{has been widely}} recognized {{as the key to}} the success of the Chinese economic reform. In this paper we study the effectiveness of this strategy in economic environments where the status quo government control is incomplete. We show that in a dynamic context intertemporal arbitrage will emerge, potentially resulting in efficiency losses and/or adverse distributional effects. Only when the status quo involves both price and quantity interventions by the government can <b>dual</b> <b>track</b> liberalization maintain its appeal. Our analysis thus suggests some caution as for the broader applicability of this reform mechanism. <b>Dual</b> <b>Track</b> Liberalization, Intertemporal Arbitrage, Pareto Improving Reforms, China...|$|R
