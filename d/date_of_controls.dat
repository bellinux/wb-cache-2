Dedifferentiation of prepanicle primordia into leaves would explain the observed equal or greater number of leaves in GA 3 -treated plants rather than the expected smaller number. It is apparent that the presence of a morphological differentiated floral meristem in sorghum does not drive subsequent floral development in the absence of inductive photoperiods. This further suggests that initial floral differentiation and subsequent floral development may be controlled separately in sorghum...|$|R

40|$|International {{audience}} Max-plus algebra is {{a suitable}} algebraic setting to model discrete event systems involving synchronization and delay phenomena {{which are often}} found in transportation networks, communications systems, and manufacturing systems. One way <b>of</b> <b>controlling</b> this kind <b>of</b> systems consists in choosing the <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> input events {{in order to achieve}} the desired performances, e. g., to obtain output events in order to respect given <b>dates.</b> This kind <b>of</b> <b>control</b> is optimal, according to a just-in-time criterion, if the input-event dates are delayed as much as possible while ensuring the output events to occur before a desired reference date. This paper presents the observer-based controller for max-plus linear systems where only estimations of system states are available for the controller. As in the classical sense, this is a state-feedback control problem, which is solved in two steps: first, an observer computes an estimation of the state by using the input and the output measurements, then, this estimated state is used to compute the state-feedback control action. As a main result, it is shown that the optimal solution <b>of</b> this observer-based <b>control</b> problem leads to a greater control input than the one obtained with the output feedback strategy.

Laboratory studies have demonstrated that iron is essential for Aspergillus growth and virulence. METHODS. In the current study, the authors retrospectively evaluated the bone marrow iron stores (BMIS) in patients with leukemia as well as recipients of allo-geneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with IA (n 5 33) and those with-out fungal infections (n 5 33). The first available bone marrow biopsy specimens prior to the IA diagnosis or <b>date</b> <b>of</b> hospitalization (<b>control</b> group) were assessed in a blinded fashion using a standardized scoring system (0 – 4). Both groups were comparable with regard to clinical characteristics and classic risk factors for IA. RESULTS. The majority of patients with IA (70 %) were found to have increased BMIS (score 3) compared with the control patients (16 %) (P <. 0001). Increased BMIS was found to be an independent risk factor for IA on multivariate analysis (P <. 0001). CONCLUSIONS.

The results showed that {{there were significant differences}} in the number of weeds between different sowing dates, weeding dates and control methods. The highest mean density and biomass of weeds were obtained on the planting date, 30 February, and when weed was controlled at the first leaf appearance stage with fire treatment. The most appropriate time for weed control was at the beginning of cumin flowering. Fire treatment reduced weed growth {{in the first half of}} growing season. However, hand weeding significantly reduced weed density and biomass in the second half of cumin growing season. The first planting date caused the lowest mean weed biomass and the highest cumin yield compared to later planting dates.

40|$|Compudose is an {{oestrogenic}} growth promotant that improves liveweight {{gain and}} {{feed conversion efficiency}} in steers. In the past {{it has not been}} recommended for use in breeding heifers because of the adverse effects of oestrogen treatment on reproductive performance. The effects of Compudose on liveweight gain, skeletal development, lactational performance, carcass characteristics and offspring performance in heifers at pasture are unknown. However, the expected increase in liveweight gain from Compudose treatment may allow target growth rates to be attained in heifers at critical times of the year, without lactational performance being affected. This study investigated the effect of treating Hereford x Friesian (H x F) once-bred heifers (OBH) with Compudose 400 at 3 months (90 days) of age (Compudose 90) and 7 months (210 days) of age (Compudose 210) compared to non-treated heifers (Control). Compudose 90 heifers (n = 14) gained 0. 63 kg/day compared with Control heifers (n = 17) which gained 0. 59 kg/day for 385 days from the time of implantation (6. 8 % increase, P 0. 05) and Compudose 210 (n = 17) heifers (P 0. 0. 5) and 19. 2 kg heavier than carcasses of Compudose 210 heifers (P < 0. 05). Wither height, girth, hip height, hip width, pelvic height and pelvic area did not differ significantly between treatment groups, but pelvic width of Compudose-treated heifers was significantly smaller than that <b>of</b> <b>Control</b> heifers (P < 0. 01). Compudose 90 and Compudose 210 heifers had an average calving date 8 days (P < 0. 10) and 10 days (P < 0. 05), respectively, later than the average calving <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>Control</b> heifers, and more compact calving spreads. There were no treatment differences in calf birthweight, however calves born to Control heifers were 15. 3 kg and 16. 2 kg heavier at weaning than calves born to Compudose 90 and Compudose 210 heifers (P < 0. 05). Compudose treatment and associated higher growth rates did not affect milk yield, as determined by the weight-nurse-weigh (WNW) method, at 4 and 8 weeks of lactation; udder volder volume at 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks of lactation (weaning), and at pre-slaughter; or udder weight at slaughter. There {{were no significant differences in}} carcass quality characteristics between treatment groups. However, carcasses of Compudose-treated heifers tended to be shorter (P < 0. 10) and have a greater rib-eye area. No significant differences in fat content, as determined by the weight of kidney and pelvic fat and fat depth, were detected between treatment groups. Implanting heifers with Compudose at 3 months of age is more beneficial than implanting heifers with Compudose at 7 months of age, but the small liveweight gain advantage would not be economically advantageous. It is concluded that Compudose is not a practical solution for improving the rearing of beef or dairy heifers, despite lactational performance not being affected...|$|R

40|$|Phenology {{models are}} tools to analyze {{changes in the}} timing and {{duration}} of the growing season. During {{the past three decades}} different budburst models have been developed, but, so far, no consensus model has been found to accurately predict budburst date across different tree species. The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate the performance of six different temperature-driven models of leaf budburst (thermal time, thermal period fixed, sequential, parallel, alternating, unified) for four temperate tree species in Belgium (birch, chestnut, oak, beech). The models were parameterized using a Bayesian approach. The performance of these models was compared using Bayesian model comparison (BMC) and root mean square error (RMSE). Model comparison showed that the two models that do not include a calculation of chilling requirement were the best for the studied four tree species. The Sequential model (SM) was the third most plausible model for predicting budburst, having a higher probability to be correct than the other two-phase models combining a chilling phase with a forcing phase. This suggested that in our budburst observation dataset, the chilling requirement was probably always fulfilled, making the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> budburst <b>controlled</b> by forcing temperature. We cannot rule out that in warmer regions or future warmer conditions, chilling may become insufficient and a sequential pattern of chilling and forcing may become most appropriate to simulate budburst date. Parameter analysis showed that the last month prior to budburst had the greatest impact on determining the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> bud opening in the case of birch and chestnut, whereas the last 3 months were the main determinants for oak and beech, the two later flushing species. Validation showed that the models that fitted the parameterization data well had much poorer performance when tested with independent data. This indicates that other factors (e. g. photoperiod) might affect the budburst process and/or model parameterization (determining the sensitivity of budburst to temperature) substantially change between different localities...|$|R
