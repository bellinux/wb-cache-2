2500|$|Stroustrup campaigned <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> years, {{way beyond}} {{any sort of}} {{technical}} contributions he made to the language, to get it adopted and used. And he sort of ran all the standards committees with a whip and a chair. And he said “no” to no one. He put every feature in that language that ever existed. It wasn’t cleanly designed—it was just the union of everything that came along. And I think it suffered drastically from that.|$|E
2500|$|Journalist Bill Moyers {{reported}} that PBS had obtained {{a copy of}} the [...] "game plan" [...] that was adopted by the industry's trade association, America's Health Insurance Plans which spelled out the industry strategies to [...] "Highlight horror stories of government-run systems." [...] Potter explained, [...] "The industry has always tried to make Americans think that government-run systems are {{the worst thing that could}} possibly happen to them, that even if you consider that, you're heading down on the slippery slope towards socialism. So they have used scare tactics <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> years, to keep that from happening. If there were a broader program like our Medicare program now, it could potentially reduce the profits of these big companies. So that is their biggest concern." ...|$|E
2500|$|Veteran full-back Becky Easton {{had played}} in Cup final defeats with Everton in 2005, Liverpool in 1995 and 1996, as well as captaining Doncaster Belles in their 2002 defeat to Fulham. She had been with Liverpool's {{forerunners}} Knowsley United, but was cup-tied for their appearance in the 1994 final. Easton said: [...] "I've been trying <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> haven't {{been able to do}} it [...] before. It would obviously be great for the club, because we haven’t won it as 'Everton', but on a personal note it would just be absolutely fantastic." [...] Rachel Brown had played for Liverpool as a 15-year-old schoolgirl in the 1996 final, but was injured in 2005 and had not played in the final again since. She told the Liverpool Echo: [...] "I wouldn't say I'm in the twilight of my career but it's {{been a long time since}} 1996, so I'm very determined to put things right." ...|$|E

2500|$|After [...] "Normal" [...] aired, {{internet}} sources {{began to}} summarize the rules for True American, which the characters described as a mix of a drinking game and Candy Land where the floor is lava; it also involves shouting the names of American presidents. The idea of True American came from a New Girl writer who played a similar game in college. As she could not remember the game's exact rules, the writers focused on making the game as funny on the page as possible, but only established chanting [...] "JFK! FDR!" [...] and walking on chairs. As the cast {{did not understand the}} game during shooting, the writers created more rules on the spot, advised the actors to [...] "have fun, dig in, jump in" [...] and play it as if [...] "they'd been playing this thing <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> years." [...] The high-energy feel of the game and the amounts of coverage made filming True American more challenging for the actors than normal episodes. Producers Dave Finkel, Brett Baer, and writer Luvh Rakhe, came up with most of the obscure American history facts, but much was cut from the finished episode.|$|E
2500|$|Mike Meadows, {{a veteran}} {{photographer}} of the Los Angeles Times, was covering a major wild fire sweeping southern California on 27 October 1993. His {{picture of a}} Los Angeles County firefighter, Mike Alves cooling himself off with water in a pool in Altadena ran both in the Times and nationally. Prior to submitting the photograph for a Pulitzer Prize, Meadows' assignment editor, Fred Sweets, contacted the firefighter, who reportedly {{said he had been}} asked by Meadows to go to the pool and splash water on his head. Meadows denied the accusation, claiming [...] "I may have been guilty of saying this would make a nice shot, but {{to the best of my}} recollection, I did not directly ask him to do that. ... I've been doing breaking news stories <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> I've never in my life set up a picture." [...] Meadows was suspended without pay for a week and picture was withdrawn from any prize competitions - the Times called it a [...] "fabrication" [...] and the paper's photography director, Larry Armstrong, said [...] "when you manipulate the situation, you manipulate the news." ...|$|E
2500|$|Screenwriter Boal {{described}} the pro-torture accusations as [...] "preposterous", stating that [...] "it's just misreading {{the film to}} say that it shows torture leading to the information about bin Laden", while director Bigelow added: [...] "Do I wish [...] was not part of that history? Yes. But it was." [...] In February 2013 in the Wall Street Journal, Boal responded to the Senate critics, being quoted as saying [...] "oes that mean they can use the movie as a political platform to talk about what they've been wanting to talk about <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> <b>years</b> <b>and</b> years? Do I think that Feinstein used the movie as a publicity tool to get a conversation going about her report? I believe it, ..." [...] referring to the intelligence committee's report on enhanced interrogations. He also said the senators' letter showed they were still concerned about public opinion supporting the effectiveness of torture and didn't want the movie reinforcing that. Boal said, though, [...] "I don't think that [...] issue has really been resolved" [...] if there is a suspect with possible knowledge of imminent attack who will not talk.|$|E
