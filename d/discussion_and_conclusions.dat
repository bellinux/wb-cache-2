In {{the last part of the}} inquest held after the sinking, a group of master shipwrights and senior naval officers were asked for their opinions about why the ship sank. Their <b>discussion</b> <b>and</b> <b>conclusions</b> show very clearly that they knew what had happened, and their verdict was summed up very clearly by one of the captains, who said that the ship did not have enough 'belly' to carry the heavy upperworks.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} {{provided}} cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary {{analyses of the}} distribution of directives in <b>discussion</b> <b>and</b> <b>conclusion</b> sections of English and Persian research articles (RAs) in disciplines of physics, chemistry, counseling, and sociology, representing hard and soft sciences, respectively. To that aim, 80 RAs from both English and Persian journals between 2000 and 2012 were selected. The RAs were textually analyzed to determine the distribution of directives. Findings revealed a significant difference between Persian hard and soft science RAs in the employment of directives, with soft science writers employing directives more frequently in <b>discussion</b> <b>and</b> <b>conclusion</b> sections in comparison with hard science writers. However, no significant difference was found in the distribution of directives across <b>discussion</b> <b>and</b> <b>conclusion</b> sections of English soft and hard RAs. Moreover, findings did not show a significant difference across Persian and English RAs. Overall, results suggest that Persian and English academic writers tend to follow a similar generic and discursive trend in the employment of directives in their <b>discussion</b> <b>and</b> <b>conclusion</b> sections pointing to the universal nature of directives as persuasive strategies employed by academic writers in canonical branches of science. The findings of the present study might raise learners' awareness of the conventions and lexico-grammatical features of academic writing in Persian and/or English RAs...|$|R
