500|$|The Hallucination version {{had only}} a basic story concept, having dropped the {{previous}} scenario penned by Noboru Sugimura of Flagship. In 2012, [...] scenario writer Yasuhisa Kawamura said {{he was responsible for}} this version, as he wanted to make Biohazard 4 scarier [...] "and suggested using a particular scene from the film Lost Souls, where the main character [...] suddenly finds herself in a derelict building with a killer on the loose. An arranged version of this idea eventually turned into Hook Man. The idea went through several iterations as Mr. Sugimura and <b>I</b> <b>carefully</b> refined this world (which, I have to say, was very romantic). Leon infiltrates the castle of Spencer seeking the truth, while inside a laboratory located deep within, a young girl wakes up. Accompanied by a B.O.W. [...] dog, the two start to make their way up the castle. Unfortunately, there were many obstacles that needed to be overcome and the cost of development was deemed too expensive." [...] Kawamura added he was very sorry and [...] "even ashamed" [...] that Mikami had to step in and scrap this version. After this attempt, the last canceled revision featured classic zombies again. However, it was discontinued after few months, and before it was ever shown to the public, as the developers felt it was too formulaic.|$|E
2500|$|If I {{send someone}} {{out of the}} room - for example, the mother and child - <b>I</b> <b>carefully</b> move father from his chair and put him into mother's chair. Or if I send the child out, I might put mother in the child's chair, at least temporarily. Sometimes I comment on this by saying, 'As you sit where your son was sitting, you can think more clearly about him.' Or, 'If you sit where your husband sat, maybe it will give you {{somewhat}} of his view about me'. Over a series of interviews with an entire family, I shuffle them about, so that what was originally mother's chair is now where father is sitting. The family grouping remains, and yet that family grouping is being rearranged, which is what you are after when changing a family." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>carefully</b> {{examined}} the writing, {{and the paper}} upon which it was written.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> {{inspected}} her <b>carefully.</b> <b>I</b> came to {{the conclusion}} that she was a [...] "grown-up" [...] and a [...] "foot-goer," [...] and pointed out her path. She looked at it, and seemed disappointed.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> had <b>carefully</b> {{prepared}} Naomi's {{mind for}} {{the decision of the}} grand jury. She bore the new blow bravely.|$|R
60|$|Jack. <b>I</b> have <b>carefully</b> {{preserved}} the Court Guides of the period. They {{are open to}} your inspection, Lady Bracknell.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>carefully</b> shifted {{my weight}} inboard {{in order to}} {{maintain}} the equilibrium as the sail emptied.|$|E
60|$|In {{accordance}} with our usual custom I scribbled it upon {{a piece of}} paper, and held {{it for a moment}} before his eyes. Then <b>I</b> <b>carefully</b> destroyed it.|$|E
6000|$|... "That being so, Monsieur le Comte," [...] said I quietly, [...] "I {{will have}} a little talk with you before going after her." [...] And <b>I</b> <b>carefully</b> closed the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{must come}} round. Slip down, and climb {{up on the}} {{opposite}} side as the sail swings over," [...] <b>I</b> said, <b>carefully</b> shoving the tiller down.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{is a thing}} <b>I</b> must <b>carefully</b> consider,' he said, {{with the}} same gloomy dryness which {{characterized}} all his words to her now. 'When I have considered, I will tell you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The lady is {{at present}} {{established}} as housekeeper in {{the employment of}} the firm of Wagner, Keller, and Engelman; and there (barring accidents, which <b>I</b> shall <b>carefully</b> look after) she is likely to remain.|$|R
60|$|At {{such times}} I was glad {{of my new}} home, and my mother found in me only the {{confident}} and hopeful son. My doubts of the future, my discouragements of the present <b>I</b> <b>carefully</b> concealed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Her {{breathing}} was {{so difficult to}} trace, that <b>I</b> <b>carefully</b> tried the pulse and the heart. There was life, and no more. Looking round as I resumed my seat, I found both the brothers intent upon me.|$|E
60|$|My {{letter of}} {{introduction}} from General Miles {{not only made}} me welcome at the Fort, it authorized me to examine the early records of the Agency, and these <b>I</b> <b>carefully</b> read in search of material concerning the Sitting Bull.|$|E
500|$|They wrote, recorded, and emailed music {{back and}} forth to each other before working {{together}} in a rehearsal space in East London. When he first read them, Smith found Croft and Sim's lyrics to be [...] "purposely ambiguous so people can relate to them", saying in an interview for Uncut, [...] "I mean… if <b>I</b> listen <b>carefully,</b> <b>I</b> do know about their lives intimately so I can guess what they’re about. But they don’t even tell each other what they’re singing about." ...|$|R
60|$|With a heavy spirit I crept out of bed, slowly {{disengaging}} Nick's arm lest {{he should}} wake. He {{turned over and}} sighed in his sleep. <b>Carefully</b> <b>I</b> dressed myself, and after I was dressed I could not refrain from slipping to the bedside to bend over him once again,--for {{he was the only}} one in my life with whom I had found true companionship. Then <b>I</b> climbed <b>carefully</b> out of the window, and so down the corner of the house to the ground.|$|R
6000|$|The present text {{is based}} upon the first edition; but this edition was so wretchedly printed that <b>I</b> have <b>carefully</b> {{collated}} it with those given in the [...] "Miscellanies" [...] (1711), Faulkner (1735), and Hawkesworth (1762).|$|R
60|$|Enclosed in {{the letter}} was the oblong {{envelope}} he spoke of, which <b>I</b> <b>carefully</b> opened. It contained only a small quantity of pale pink powder, which emitted a faint pungent odor. I locked it up in my desk, and destroyed the letter.|$|E
60|$|Before doing so, however, <b>I</b> <b>carefully</b> {{examined}} the caps of my rifle and loosened my long hunting-knife in its sheath. Then I cautiously followed up the track, making as little noise as possible, for I {{was well aware}} of the watchfulness of the animal I was pursuing.|$|E
60|$|I kept {{close to}} the edge of the forest, in the very midst of which the hill seemed to rise. Though <b>I</b> <b>carefully</b> scanned the cliff as I traversed its base, I saw no sign of any other {{entrance}} than that to which my guides had led me.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a capital}} dinner, and <b>I</b> went <b>carefully</b> {{through all the}} courses. I was hungry. I had been saving up some extra {{appetite}} for this dinner, and my regular appetite {{was a very good}} one.|$|R
60|$|Unfolding the {{manuscript}} <b>I</b> spread it <b>carefully</b> on my knee {{and began to}} read.|$|R

60|$|Peering and feeling, <b>I</b> <b>carefully</b> {{examined}} the chamber in which I had been placed. I understood from what I {{had heard that}} I should soon {{have to leave it}} again in order to appear before this tribunal, but still it is not my nature to throw away any possible chances.|$|E
60|$|My father's coldness of manner had not altered {{since his}} return to London. On my side, <b>I</b> <b>carefully</b> abstained from uttering a word before him, which bore the {{smallest}} reference to my real situation. Although when we met, we outwardly preserved the usual relations of parent and child, the estrangement between us had now become complete.|$|E
6000|$|... "The dog {{was beside}} me; {{his head again}} lay upon my knees. With a feeling of awe, yet strangely enough without fear, <b>I</b> <b>carefully</b> passed my hand over the animal's head. I felt his ears, his nose, his jaws, and his neck. They were not the head, the ears, the nose, the jaws, or the neck of Ajax! ...|$|E
60|$|He {{published}} other books, {{of a high}} moral {{tone and}} unapproachable principle, which <b>I</b> read <b>carefully</b> for some ray of human weakness, for some stroke of nature untrammelled by the calling code of polite society. But in vain.|$|R
5000|$|A {{collection}} of Michelle's catchphrase - [...] "Listen <b>Carefully,</b> <b>I</b> shall say this only once..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes, sir; {{but it is}} just {{possible}} that they may have seen the smoke of this hut also, and be making their way here. Though <b>I</b> looked <b>carefully</b> on all sides I could see no other signs of life.” ...|$|R
6000|$|Meanwhile, in {{preparation}} for the summer term I gladly helped stamp and mail Brown's circulars. The lecture [...] "Edwin Booth as Iago" [...] <b>I</b> <b>carefully</b> re-wrote--for Brown had placed it on his printed programme and had also announced me as [...] "Instructor in Literature." [...] I took care to send this circular to all my friends and relatives in the west.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>carefully</b> and {{deliberately}} made these observations before allowing myself {{to take one}} glance at the benches before me; having handled the crayon, {{looked back at the}} tableau, fingered the sponge in order to ascertain that it was in a right state of moisture, I found myself cool enough to admit of looking calmly up and gazing deliberately round me.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{would be}} a {{dangerous}} error, my son, and <b>I</b> <b>carefully</b> admonish thee against the evils of self-righteousness. That God selecteth his agents, is beyond dispute; {{but it is a}} fearful error to mistake the impulses of self-love, for the movements of his Divine Spirit! It is hardly safe for any who have not received the church's ordination, to deem themselves chosen vessels." ...|$|E
60|$|Then and there, <b>carefully,</b> <b>I</b> {{repeated}} the verse he had twice spoken and once written not ten minutes ago.|$|R
6000|$|So your Greek {{uses his}} common sense, wastes no time, uses no skill, {{and says to}} you, [...] "Here is beautifully set tresses, which <b>I</b> have <b>carefully</b> {{designed}} and easily stamped.

6000|$|... "That's a {{question}} <b>I</b> have <b>carefully</b> put to myself; and upon the whole the probabilities are {{in favour of}} her accepting him in time. I flatter myself that I have some influence over her. She is pliable, and I can be strong in my recommendations of him." ...|$|R
