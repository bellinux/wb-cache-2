A 1998 {{article in the}} New <b>England</b> <b>Journal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Medicine</b> attributed his death to typhoid fever complicated by bowel perforation and ascending paralysis. Another recent analysis suggested pyogenic (infectious) spondylitis or meningitis. Other illnesses fit the symptoms, including acute pancreatitis and West Nile virus. Natural-cause theories also tend to emphasize that Alexander's health {{may have been in}} general decline after years of heavy drinking and severe wounds. The anguish that Alexander felt after Hephaestion's death may also have contributed to his declining health.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most {{strains of}} influenza, H1N1 does not disproportionately infect adults older than 60years; {{this was an}} unusual and {{characteristic}} feature of the H1N1 pandemic. Even {{in the case of}} previously very healthy people, a small percentage will develop pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This manifests itself as increased breathing difficulty and typically occurs 3–6 days after initial onset of flu symptoms. The pneumonia caused by flu can be either direct viral pneumonia or a secondary bacterial pneumonia. In fact, a November 2009 New <b>England</b> <b>Journal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Medicine</b> article recommends that flu patients whose chest X-ray indicates pneumonia receive both antivirals and antibiotics.|$|E

40|$|Background: In May 2006, {{a search}} was {{conducted}} of the 20 highest cited articles related to Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) through MEDLINE Publication Types. The New <b>England</b> <b>Journal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Medicine’s</b> (N Engl J Med’s) and Lancet’s articles were cited {{for the most}} part in the top cited twenty articles. Therefore, an investigation with the highest Impact Factors of the top three cited journals was carried out. Moreover, MEDLINE’s Publication Type data was added. Purpose: This article explains that the cluster of highest cited articles was related to EBM. Bibliometric analysis of the N Engl J Med, JAMA and Lancet was used, which had more than 3800 articles or reviews from 2002 to 2004 in the “Web of Science”. Method: The category “MEDICINE, GENERAL & INTERNAL “of” Journal Citation Reports” was searched with the highest Impact Factor of the three journals’ articles cited the most times by using the Web of Science’s General Search. Further to that, the MEDLINE’s Publication Type was searched to find a relation to EBM articles, Reviews, or other Publication Types, for example, a Comparative Study, and so on. Results: 1 : The articles of N Engl J Med were quoted 1. 5 times for the three journals over three years. EBM related articles were cited from 2. 3 to 3. 0 times. Review articles, however, were cited 0. 95 times. 2 : The articles of JAMA were quoted 0. 9 times for the three journals during three years. EBM related articles were cited from 1. 7 to 1. 4 times. Practice Guideline articles were cited 9. 3 times. 3 : The articles of Lancet were quoted 0. 7 times for the three journals over three years. EBM related articles were cited from 1. 2 to 1. 6 times. Conclusion: It was proven that EBM relation Publication Type articles were quoted more often than in any other article...|$|R
500|$|In 1843, Holmes {{published}} [...] "The Contagiousness of puerperal fever" [...] in {{the short-lived}} publication New <b>England</b> Quarterly <b>Journal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Medicine</b> and Surgery. The essay argued—contrary {{to popular belief}} at the time, which predated germ theory of disease—that the cause of puerperal fever, a deadly infection contracted by women during or shortly after childbirth, stems from patient to patient contact via their physicians. Holmes gathered a large collection of evidence for this theory, including stories of doctors who had become ill and died after performing autopsies on patients who had likewise been infected. In concluding his case, he insisted that a physician in whose practice even one case of puerperal fever had occurred, had {{a moral obligation to}} purify his instruments, burn the clothing he had worn while assisting in the fatal delivery, and cease obstetric practice for a period of at least six months. A few years later, Ignaz Semmelweis would reach similar conclusions in Vienna, where his introduction of prophylaxis (handwashing in chlorine solution before assisting at delivery) would considerably lower the puerperal mortality rate.|$|R
5000|$|Holmes {{developed}} {{an interest in}} puerperal fever by accident. In 1836 Holmes graduated from Harvard Medical School. He was Professor of Anatomy and Physiology at Dartmouth College from 1838 to 1840. In 1840 Holmes went back to Boston, took up general practice, and joined the Boston Society for Medical Improvement. At one of the meetings of the Society a report was presented about a physician who had performed a post mortem examination {{of a woman who}} had died from puerperal fever. Within a week that doctor himself died of infection, seemingly contracted when he was wounded during the autopsy he had conducted on the dead woman. The report stated that during the time interval between when the physician received the wound and then subsequently died from it, all the women whom he had attended during childbirth contracted puerperal fever. This report seems to have convinced Holmes that “The disease, known as Puerperal Fever, is so far contagious as to be frequently carried from patient to patient by physicians and nurses.” The end of the essay included eight steps which birth attendants needed to adhere to in order {{to prevent the spread of}} infection from patient to patient, especially infected patients to susceptible women after childbirth. Until this time in history these eight rules were the most definitive standard so far published on the control of this terrifying illness. Adhering to these protocols no doubt saved innumerable lives around the world. Unfortunately the essay did not enjoy the early and wide distribution which it deserved. The essay first came to light as a paper read before the Boston Society for Medical Improvement. The Society asked that the essay be published as a paper in the New <b>England</b> Quarterly <b>Journal</b> <b>of</b> <b>Medicine</b> and Surgery in April 1843. Due to low circulation <b>of</b> this specialized <b>journal</b> and the fact that the journal was discontinued after just one year, the paper was not properly brought to the attention of either physicians or the public at large. In 1852 Dr. James Copeland mentioned the Holmes essay positively in his well-respected Dictionary <b>of</b> Practical <b>Medicine.</b> Dr. Copeland, who was the Consulting Physician to Queen Charlotte's Lying-in Hospital in London, affirmed the contagiousness of puerperal fever by pointing out that [...] "Dr. Holmes has forcibly and eloquently brought this much neglected subject before the profession." [...] Dr. Copeland unfortunately also added that there was no consensus on the infectiousness of puerperal fever with such eminent experts as Hulme, Leake, Hull, Beaudeloque, Tonnellé, Dugé, Dewees and others still denying this fact. Twelve years after the original publication in 1843 Holmes reprinted his essay in 1855 as a private publication. He entitled it “Puerperal Fever as a Private Pestilence.” He had two main reasons for the reprint: first, because of the poor distribution of the essay at first; and second, to warn his fellow doctors and convince them of the contagiousness of puerperal fever. Holmes added a preface to the original essay, stating all the issues, deflating the pretensions of the professors who were still denying the cause of the fever, and warning medical students of the illogical nature of their arguments.|$|R
