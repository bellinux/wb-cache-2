500|$|The critic Peter Latham {{remarked that}} he was {{surprised}} that Bax had never set any of Yeats's poems to music. Bax replied, [...] "What, I? <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>never</b> dare!". Latham added that Bax's sensitiveness to poetic values made him [...] "painfully aware of the violence that even the best musical setting must do to a poem". Eventually this feeling caused him to give up song-writing completely.|$|E
500|$|Nicholson was a {{supporter}} of public education, promoting laws to support it, and funded the construction of [...] "King William's School" [...] (predecessor/ancestor to today's St. John's College, a noted academic humanities, liberal arts school, emphasing a [...] "classical education" [...] and [...] "The Great Books"). [...] He became embroiled in a dispute with William Penn from the Middle Atlantic colony to the north, over {{how to deal with}} the issue of piracy. [...] In Maryland, Nicholson vigorously cracked down on the practices of some colonists to tolerate pirates, who brought goods and hard currency into the provinces. [...] Aware that Penn's governor William Markham was similarly tolerant (he was said to be taking bribes to allow pirates such as Thomas Day to trade in Pennsylvania), Nicholson ordered that ships destined for Pennsylvania be stopped and searched in Maryland waters, and collected duties if they were carrying European finished goods. [...] Penn protested to the Board of Trade, and the dispute subsided when Nicholson moderated his tactics. [...] During Nicholson's rule in Maryland, he specifically denied that the colonists had the Rights of Englishmen, writing that [...] "if I had not hampered them [...] in Maryland, and kept them under, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>never</b> have been able to govern them." [...] His feud with pirates took a personal turn when in 1700 he accompanied the captain of HMS Shoreham in a fierce all-day battle against French pirate Louis Guittar. The defeated pirates asked Nicholson for quarter and pardon; he granted them quarter but referred them to King William III of England for mercy, in whose courts Guittar and his crew were all sentenced to hang.|$|E

[...] "She wrapped herself around me and enlightened me. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>never</b> have fled. I should have guessed at the tenderness behind her poor ruses." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before she {{was three}} years old, her mother began taking Burlingame to the Roger Williams Church; Sunday School and church {{in the morning and}} again to church in the afternoon. When 15, her Sunday school teacher asked her if she wasn't ready to become a Christian. She stated, “The thought at once came {{forcibly}} to me that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>never</b> become a Christian in future time, it must be in some present moment.” She made the decision and was baptized in April, 1851, by Rev. Eli Noyes, returned from India, and pastor of the Roger Williams Church. She went on to say that, “The Roger Williams Church opened its doors to advocates of anti-slavery, temperance, and the broader life for women. Few churches of the other denominations did." ...|$|E

2500|$|In May 2000, Westbrook {{was photographed}} at the British Soap Awards, where {{an image of}} her missing [...] was given {{to a series of}} tabloid newspapers, {{unveiling}} her secret and highlighting her excessive drug abuse. Westbrook was checked into rehab and, six months later, she appeared on the Channel 4 show The Priory with the claim that she was clean and had been free from drugs for months. However, hosts Jamie Theakston and Zoë Ball struggled to get coherent answers from Westbrook, who was under the influence of drugs despite her claims of abstinence. Reflecting back on the event in 2002, Westbrook commented [...] "I said I was clean, but it was obvious I wasn't. I looked about 50, and my voice was shaky. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>never</b> have been allowed on. They wanted to laugh at me, rip me apart. I despise that sort of thing, but it did me the world of good because watching it I realised, 'I'm so ill.' When it came to the crunch I thought, 'Hang on. I don't want to die.'" ...|$|E
