25|$|Nano-FTIR {{was first}} {{described}} in 2005 in a patent by Ocelic and Hillenbrand as Fourier transform spectroscopy of tip-scattered light with an asymmetric spectrometer (i.e. the tip/sample placed {{inside one of}} the interferometer arms). The first realization of s-SNOM with FTIR was demonstrated in 2006 in the laboratory of F. Keilmann using a mid-infrared source based on a simple version of nonlinear difference-frequency generation (DFG). However, the mid-IR spectra in this realization were recorded using dual comb spectroscopy principles, yielding a discrete set of frequencies and thus demonstrating a multiheterodyne imaging technique rather than nano-FTIR. The first continuous spectra were recorded only in 2009 in the same laboratory using a supercontinuum IR beam also obtained by DFG in GaSe upon superimposing two pulsed trains emitted from Er-doped fiber laser. This source further allowed in 2011 for the first assessment of nanoscale-resolved spectra of SiC with excellent quality and spectral resolution. At the same time, Huth et al. in the laboratory of R. Hillenbrand used IR radiation from a simple <b>glowbar</b> source in combination with the principles of Fourier transform spectroscopy, to record IR spectra of p-doped Si and its oxides in a semiconductor device. In the same work the term nano-FTIR was first introduced. However, an insufficient spectral irradiance of <b>glowbar</b> sources limited the applicability of the technique to the detection of strongly-resonant excitations such phonons; and the early supercontinuum IR laser sources, while providing more power, had very narrow bandwidth (<300nbsp&cm−1). Further attempt to improve the spectral power, while retaining the large bandwidth of a <b>glowbar</b> source was made by utilizing the IR radiation from a high temperature argon arc source (also known as plasma source). However, due to lack of commercial availability and rapid development of the IR supercontinium laser sources, plasma sources are not widely utilized in nano-FTIR.|$|E

Particularly, {{it has been shown that}} nano-FTIR is capable of measuring molecular fingerprints which match well with far-field FTIR spectra, owing to the asymmetry of the nano-FTIR spectrometer that provides phase and thus gives access to the molecular absorption. Recently, the first nanoscale-resolved infrared hyperspectral imaging of a co-polymer blend was demonstrated, which allowed for the application of statistical techniques such as multivariate analysis - a widely used tool for heterogeneous sample analysis.|$|E
30|$|The {{growth of}} Ge islands using MBE was studied using Veeco, Nanoscope-IV atomic force {{microscope}} (AFM). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was carried out using a JEM 2100 F (JEOL) field emission system with an operating voltage of 200 kV to probe the formation of Ge nanocrystals in the oxide matrix. Raman spectra of the grown samples were obtained with a Renishaw Raman microscope equipped with a He-Ne laser excitation source emitting at a wavelength of 632.8 nm and a Peltier cooled (- 70 °C) charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. PL spectra of samples were recorded using a He-Cd laser as an excitation source, operating at 325 nm with an output power density of 1.3 W/cm 2 and a TRIAX 320 monochromator fitted with a photomultiplier or an InGaAs detector. The photocurrent (PC) spectra were investigated under monochromatic light dispersed from a <b>glowbar</b> source by grating spectrometer and chopped at a frequency of 233 Hz. PC signals were detected by a standard lock-in amplifier technique. Aluminum was deposited {{on top of the}} sample by masking and was rapid thermal annealed at 200 C for 10 min to form a good ohmic contact. At backside, native oxide was etched by HF followed by Al deposition to form the ohmic contact. The electrical properties of the grown structures were measured using a Keithley semiconductor parameter analyzer (4200 -SCS).|$|E
