50|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{problems}} with the shirt stays is that they come off. For this problem there are solutions in the form of belts that go around your <b>waist,</b> <b>inside</b> your pants. Some are made of rubber and work by friction to keep the shirt from sliding up.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Dive" [...] was filmed in July 2012, {{directed}} by Chris Applebaum, and released to VEVO on August 25, 2012. In the video, Victoria's Secret Angel model Chanel Iman plays as Usher's love interest. Set on a luxury Yacht {{in the open}} sea, the video begins with Usher talking, before showing him singing the first verse. The video intercuts to Iman, and Usher inside a cabin with water gushing in. For the chorus, Usher and Iman are being intimate, with water further entering the singer's cabin. Usher and Iman are once again being intimate for the second verse, sat outside of the Yacht, with water now level with Usher's <b>waist</b> <b>inside</b> the cabin, entering the second chorus, where Usher and Iman make love. During the bridge, both are romancing within the cabin's bathroom, with the video intercutting to different romantic scenarios. Further scenarios are shown in the final chorus, with the water now fully submerging the cabin and Usher. The video closes with Usher swimming to safety, but before reaching the surface, he and Iman approach each other, embracing in the water. Opening the 2012 iTunes Festival, Usher performed [...] "Dive" [...] {{for the first time}} along with [...] "Can't Stop Won't Stop", [...] "Twisted" [...] and [...] "Numb" [...] and other songs.|$|R
40|$|AbstractNowadays, {{smartphones}} play an ubiquitous role in accessing {{and processing}} information, {{most of them}} having a myriad of integrated sensors that makes them capable of generating information with high accuracy and precision. The monitoring of physical exercises presents itself {{as one of the}} new trends, made possible by the use of devices like smartphones. Motion sensors such as the accelerometer enable live motion measurement. This paper intends to study this issue and develop an application for the Android operating system, which takes advantage of sensors embedded in smartphones and web technologies, with the goal to classify multiple physical activities. The developed solution is based on client-server architecture. The client application performs data acquisition, visualization and recording of the signal obtained by the smartphone's accelerometer and the server application receives the information acquired by the client, processes it and classifies it. In order for the application to be able to classify multiple movements throughout the activity performed by the user, an extensive analysis of the acquired signals was carried out to understand their most distinctive features. We used a supervised approach with the goal of reviewing the best techniques that should be useful for achieving the classification with the lowest error. For the signals acquisition the smartphone was positioned along the <b>waist,</b> <b>inside</b> the right front pocket in an attempt to simulate conditions as naturally as possible. The study explored features extracted in both the time and frequency domain, and parametric and non-parametric classifiers. Preliminary results demonstrate that the classification of activities can be done with remarkable accuracy (> 95 %) ...|$|R
