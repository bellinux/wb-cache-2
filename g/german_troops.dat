5|$|Roughly 100,000 British and <b>German</b> <b>troops</b> were {{involved}} in the unofficial cessations of hostility along the Western Front. The first truce started on Christmas Eve 1914, when <b>German</b> <b>troops</b> decorated the area around their trenches in the region of Ypres, Belgium and particularly in Saint-Yvon (called Saint-Yves, in Plugstreet/Ploegsteert – Comines-Warneton), where Capt. Bruce Bairnsfather described the truce.|$|E
5|$|In May, <b>German</b> <b>troops</b> of the 750th Infantry Regiment of the 704th Infantry Division were {{stationed}} in the Mačva, Jadra and Pocerina (Cer) districts of the Podrinje region, garrisoning Šabac, Banja Koviljača and Loznica.|$|E
5|$|In addition, no uniformed <b>German</b> <b>troops</b> were {{stationed}} in Casablanca during World War II, and neither American nor French troops occupied Berlin in 1918.|$|E

5|$|On 14 August, Canadian forces {{launched}} Operation Tractable, {{in conjunction}} with American movements northwards to Chambois. On 19 August, a brigade of the Polish 1st Armoured Division linked up with forces of the 90th U.S. Infantry Division, sealing off some 50,000 <b>German</b> <b>troops</b> in the pocket. By 21 August, German attempts to reopen the gap had been thwarted, and all <b>German</b> <b>troops</b> trapped in the pocket surrendered to Allied forces, effectively {{putting an end to}} the German 7th Army.|$|E
5|$|On the 21st, {{the local}} defence forces were enlisted to help mop up straggling <b>German</b> <b>troops,</b> and the 4th Indian Division pressed onward through a heavy gale {{and passed out}} of the country.|$|E
5|$|Some historians {{state that}} the <b>German</b> <b>troops</b> did not expect the Soviet {{armoured}} counterattack and were taken by surprise on 12 July. However other historians have stated or argued that the German commanders were aware of, or at least anticipated, the Soviet armour that was massing around Prokhorovka, and therefore the troops {{could not have been}} genuinely surprised. The German historian Dieter Brand argues that even though the German commanders expected a major Soviet armoured deployment at Prokhorovka, the frontline <b>German</b> <b>troops</b> were indeed largely taken by surprise when the Soviets counterattacked on the morning of 12 July.|$|E
50|$|In 1944, {{thousands}} of <b>Germans</b> <b>troops</b> were encircled by a mostly Canadian {{force in the}} Breskens Pocket during the Battle of the Scheldt.|$|R

50|$|Although an Armistice between Italy and Allied {{armed forces}} was {{declared}} on September 8, allied forces continued bombing until September 15 ostensibly to prevent <b>German</b> <b>troop</b> movements.|$|R
5|$|With the chateau secure, the 3,500 British and <b>German</b> <b>troops</b> in the {{vicinity}} were able to defend the strongpoint against an estimated 14,500 French soldiers. About 8,000 French soldiers died attacking Hougoumont over the day.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Monsabert's attempt to {{liberate}} Marseille commenced. At first, a German force at Aubagne was defeated before French troops attacked the city directly. Unlike Toulon, the German commander at Marseille did not evacuate the civilian population, which became increasingly hostile. The resulting fighting with FFI troops further weakened the German units, which were exhausted from partisan fighting. The Wehrmacht {{was not able}} to defend on a broad front and soon crumbled into numerous isolated strongpoints. On 27August most of the city was liberated, with only a few small strongpoints remaining, and on 28August <b>German</b> <b>troops</b> issued the official surrender. The battle caused 1,825 French casualties, but 11,000 <b>German</b> <b>troops</b> were captured. In both harbours, German engineers had demolished port facilities to deny their use to the Allies.|$|E
5|$|Detachment Brandenstein {{attacked}} {{towns of}} Kotka and Lahti. The Red Guards' strong defence {{in the former}} stalled the Germans' plan, but they took over Lahti on 19–20 April. The <b>German</b> <b>troops</b> advanced from east-southeast; via Nastola, through Mustankallio graveyard in Salpausselkä and Russian garrisons of Hennala. The battle was mild, but strategically important as it cut connection between the western and eastern Red Guards. Fierce battles, in {{the town and the}} surrounding area broke out between 22 April and 2 May 1918, as several thousand western Red Guard and Red civilian refugees tried to push through Lahti on their way to Russia. The <b>German</b> <b>troops</b> were able to hold major parts of the town and halt the Red advance. Around 600 Reds and 80 German soldiers perished in the Lahti combats. In total 30,000 Reds were imprisoned in the town and the surrounding area.|$|E

5|$|General Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien, {{commander}} of the British II Corps, issued orders forbidding friendly communication with the opposing <b>German</b> <b>troops.</b> Adolf Hitler, then a young corporal of the 16th Bavarian Reserve Infantry, was also an opponent of the truce.|$|E
5|$|Germany, led by Adolf Hitler, {{now turned}} its {{attention}} to the Klaipėda Region, then held by Lithuania. In April 1938, Hitler stated that control of the Port of Klaipėda (German: Memel) and its surrounding area was Germany's second-most important issue, following {{the status of the}} Sudeten area. In the event of armed hostilities between Poland and Lithuania, <b>German</b> <b>troops</b> were to defend and occupy the Klaipėda region and significant portions of western Lithuania. The Polish ambassador to Nazi Germany, Józef Lipski, was informed of these plans. The Poles agreed to cooperate with <b>German</b> <b>troops</b> and to respect German interests in Klaipėda if such an armed conflict were to arise. However, in Hitler's assessment, an immediate bid for Klaipėda was impolitic; he wished {{to maintain the status quo}} until more time had passed after the Anschluss. The German suggestion was that Lithuania concede to the Polish demands.|$|E

5|$|On 10 March 1941, with Operation Barbarossa looming, Felix was {{amended to}} Operation Felix-Heinrich, whereby <b>German</b> <b>troops</b> would be {{withdrawn}} from the USSR to capture Gibraltar. As a result of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco's intransigence, the operation was postponed, modified, and ultimately abandoned.|$|E
5|$|On 18 September 1944, the {{provisional}} government {{formed by the}} National Committee of the Republic of Estonia in Tallinn re-declared the independence of Estonia. Estonian military units clashed with <b>German</b> <b>troops</b> in Tallinn, seizing the state offices at Toompea. The government appealed to the Soviet Union to recognize {{the independence of the}} republic.|$|E
5|$|On 21 August, Taskforce Butler {{occupied}} the hills {{north of the}} town of Montélimar, according to revised orders from Truscott, as he considered it too weak to block the entire German force marching north. From this position, Taskforce Butler fired on the evacuating <b>German</b> <b>troops,</b> while waiting for further reinforcements. Troops from the FFI supported the Americans, harassing <b>German</b> <b>troops</b> through the entire battle. The sudden appearance of this new threat shocked Wiese and the German command. As a first countermeasure, Wietersheim's 11thPanzer Division was called in. The first of its units to arrive, together with several ad-hoc Luftwaffe battle groups, were tasked to deal with this new threat. This hastily assembled force mounted an attack against Puy the same day, and the Germans were able to isolate Taskforce Butler from supplies. This success was, however, short-lived, and the Germans were pushed back soon after.|$|E

5|$|On 22 June, the Soviets {{launched}} a strategic offensive in Belarus ("Operation Bagration") that destroyed the German Army Group Centre almost completely. Soon after that another Soviet strategic offensive forced <b>German</b> <b>troops</b> from Western Ukraine and Eastern Poland. The Soviet advance prompted resistance forces in Poland to initiate several uprisings against the German occupation. However, {{the largest of}} these in Warsaw, where German soldiers massacred 200,000 civilians, and a national uprising in Slovakia, did not receive Soviet support and were subsequently suppressed by the Germans. The Red Army's strategic offensive in eastern Romania cut off and destroyed the considerable <b>German</b> <b>troops</b> there and triggered a successful coup d'état in Romania and in Bulgaria, followed by those countries' shift to the Allied side.|$|E
