A defendant’s breach of one should not affect the Government’s obligation to perform under the other.

This intertwining undermines sentencing policy as set forth in the federal sentencing statute. Thus, a district court should continue to consider a defendant’s substantial assistance when imposing a criminal sentence even if a breach of the plea agreement alleviates the Government of its duty to move for a sentence reduction under an intertwined cooperation agreement...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Multiple, <b>independent</b> robot {{platforms}} <b>promise</b> significant advantage {{with respect}} to robustness and flexi-bility. However, coordination between otherwise independent robots requires the exchange of information; either implicitly (as in gestural communication), or explicitly (as in message passing in a communication network.) In either case, control processes resident on all coordinated peers must participate in the collective behavior. This paper evaluates the potential to scale such a coupled control framework to many partici-pating individuals, where scalability is evaluated {{in terms of the}} schedulability of coupled, distributed control processes. We examine how schedulability affects the scalability of a robot system, and discuss an algorithm used for off-line schedulability analysis of a distributed task model. We present a distributed coordinated search task and analyze the schedulability of the designed task structure. We are able to analyze communication delays in the system that put upper bounds {{on the size of the}} robot teams. We show that hierarchical methods can be used to overcome the scalability problem. We propose that schedulability analysis should be an integrated part of a multi-robot team design process...|$|R
40|$|Component-based {{environmental}} modeling, or loose model coupling, {{has been}} proposed {{as an alternative to}} traditional tight model coupling, which is characterized by inflexible and often large model codes with highly interdependent functions compiled into a single execution unit. Loosely coupling model components developed by decomposing complex systems into smaller or less complex <b>independent</b> units <b>promises</b> earth systems modelers: (1) an approach to better explore feedbacks between domains of different disciplines that are typically modeled independently, and (2) a way to experiment with different process formulations to select those that are most appropriate for a particular application. The additional function calls, data transformations, and discontinuity at the connection points between model components resulting from the use of component-based modeling may, however, give rise to computational penalties, including increased simulation time and mass balance error. In the study presented here, we sought to investigate these computational penalties as the number of coupled model components increases using the Open Modeling Interface (OpenMI), which is component-based modeling interface specification. A Stormwater Management Model (SWMM) application developed for the City of Logan, Utah, USA and run in its standard, tightly coupled configuration served as a reference against which several configurations of coupled OpenMI-compliant SWMM model components were compared. The various configurations of coupled OpenMI SWMM model components were derived by decomposing the reference SWMM model first by process (i. e., runoff coupled to routing) and then by space (i. e., catchments or groups of catchments coupled together). Results showed that simulation times increased linearly as the number of connections between model components increased. The results also showed that changes in total mass balance error introduced through coupling were dependent on how well each model component was able to resolve the time series data it received. This study also demonstrates and proposes some strategies to address these computational penalties in component-based modeling frameworks...|$|R

The focus in such interventions on the <b>independent,</b> entrepreneurial citizen <b>promises</b> not only new ways to generate economic growth and sustainable development, but a fundamental recalibration of the repressive social relations thought {{to be at the}} root of women’s persistent ‘under-development’. The paper explores women’s experiences from their roles as entrepreneurs, and reflects on how the learning processes and outcomes associated with microcredit schemes ‘shape the self’, often in quite unpredictable ways. The paper reports an ethnographic study of disadvantaged women in Dar es Salaam and follows them as they participate in NGO-based training schemes, ‘practice’ entrepreneurship in a range of income-generating settings, and negotiate the consequences of the new subjectivities on which the independent, entrepreneurial citizen is based. Like many microcredit programmes, the majority of women in the study were full time housewives before joining the scheme. Others had left their jobs on the grounds of retrenchment, prejudice or gender discrimination. In all cases, they started their own businesses with little or no business experience or education. Whilst some appear to have embraced the new opportunities, others have struggled. In all cases, microcredit and the learning processes it unleashes, produces contradictory and ambivalent feelings of success and failure, hope and disappointment, progress and exclusion. The paper explores these ambivalences in order to critique development initiatives that are based on universal notions of autonomy and self-determination in contexts shaped by dependence and structural inequality...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Christian {{community}} development (CCD) practitioners are {{a growing body}} of contemporary Christian servant-leaders, who are committed to building beloved community in neighborhoods labeled as “under-resourced” across the country. In September 2014, nearly 3, 000 CCD proponents, pastors, practitioners, and students from all across the U. S. and oversees gathered for the 26 th Annual Christian Community Development Association National Conference in Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina. The theme for the conference was “flourishing. ” During the 12 months preceding the 4 -day conference event, local church, and community leaders from Raleigh-Durham and vicinity gathered monthly to build relationships, plan, and coordinate the logistics. The conference provided a fresh opportunity for the Durham community to examine and consider the state of relations between the local church and the community. Local conference organizers comprised of clergy, lay persons, CEOs, executive directors of non-profit organizations, government workers, and <b>independent</b> residents <b>promised</b> to continue to meet to build upon learnings, strategize community initiatives, and seek to unify the Body of Christ in Durham. This thesis draws upon the principles and practices espoused by CCDA and deals specifically with the lived experiences of Christian servants, churches, and institutions seeking to do good in Northeast Central Durham. The questions explored and claims made in this thesis deal with whether there is sufficient historical evidence for real community flourishing in NECD through holistic church-based community engagement. The period from 1994 – 2014 serves as the historical frame of this project while the project’s sociological scope is conscribed within a specific, 4 square-mile area of NECD. Theologically, this thesis is grounded in the leadership concept of priestly listening and faithful Christian witness inspired by prophetic hope and practical models of church and community mutual enrichment. The core claim and final move of this thesis is that faithful and effective works of love are bound to emerge in NECD either through one or several local churches with the right catalysts. This final project illumines the embers of hope in the midst of painful realities whereby independent Christian efforts and congregational activities have and have yet to be the most powerful agents of change in ways that politicians and city governments cannot fathom. DurhamCares, Inc., a Christian non-profit organization emerges to work strategically for church-based mobilization initiatives collaborating with the community toward collective action in cooperation with government, businesses, and area non-profit organizations.

Through a humble posture of listening to the community and responding faithfully to calls to action, local churches can lead the way to holistic solutions in action that address their community’s most pressing problems and highest aspirations. NECD is a vibrant playground for just such consideration and hope. Dissertatio...|$|R
40|$|This Article {{makes two}} arguments. First, the dilemma posed by {{software}} transactions-sales or licenses?-should {{be answered by}} dynamic contract law. Dynamic contract law has as its objective effectuating {{the intent of the}} parties but weighs that objective against policy considerations. Second, the validity of a license grant should not be inextricably tied to the validity of the contract as a whole. The problem with relying on contract doctrine in the context of software licensing is that, too often, the application of that doctrine is static and formalistic. A new doctrine is not necessary to address software licensing issues; rather, the old doctrine needs to be reinvigorated to address changes in the marketplace. A license grant is not solely and exclusively a contractual term, the validity of which depends on the validity of the contract in its entirety; rather, in the event that a software license fails as a contract, the license grant may be considered-separate from the contract as a whole-as a promise made by the licensor that is contingent on the licensee 2 ̆ 7 s performance and adherence to its terms. Part II discusses the implications of the licensing dilemma and the ramifications that flow from a determination of the transaction as either a license or a sale. Part III summarizes existing approaches to the software licensing dilemma and proposes a 2 ̆ 2 dynamic contracts 2 ̆ 2 approach to examining software transactions. A dynamic contracts approach identifies the nature of the transaction as relevant to determining the intent of the parties. Part III also proposes several criteria for distinguishing a 2 ̆ 2 sales 2 ̆ 2 transaction from a 2 ̆ 2 licensing 2 ̆ 2 transaction and acknowledges that most software transactions contain aspects of both. In addition, Part III discusses the effect of written terms that accompany a product in both a licensing and a sales transaction. Because software license agreements are contracts, their validity and enforceability should depend first and foremost on their validity and enforceability as contracts; however, rather than examining the written agreement in order to characterize the transaction, we should look to the transaction to determine how to interpret the written terms. In a sales transaction, the license grant is effective as a <b>promise</b> <b>independent</b> from the other terms contained in the 2 ̆ 2 contract. 2 ̆ 2 Recognizing the independence of license grant provisions exposes the binary proposition of license versus sale as a false dichotomy. Part IV examines two common license restrictions and discusses how each should be interpreted using a dynamic contracts approach. Part V discusses and responds to anticipated objections to this approach. This Article concludes that the software licensing dilemma is a red herring. Technology has created challenges for software producers, but those challenges are not unique to the software industry. Before we distort existing legal doctrine in an effort to accommodate the perceived needs of a specific market segment, we should carefully consider the impact of doing so on other market segments. It would be much wiser to take the long view to address technological changes than to create exceptions that morph into rules with regrettable implications...|$|R
40|$|Against expectations, Mike Rann’s Labor {{government}} is functioning smoothly, according to Haydon ManningOVER {{the last decade}} and a half South Australians have enjoyed only four years of government by a party able to command a clear majority on the floor of parliament, and the outcome of the February 2002 state election altered nothing in this regard. As a consequence of a remarkably Machiavellian deal struck between former Liberal MP, Peter Lewis, and Labor leader, Mike Rann, Labor took office but few at the outset expected anything other than a period of unstable government. Yet, at the time of writing the first 100 days of the Rann Labor Government is about to pass and stability is the order of the day, courtesy of an extremely cautious government but also one which has shrewdly courted another independent and ex-Liberal, Bob Such. Thus, Labor governs with a buffer of two independents - Peter Lewis as Speaker of the lower house and under constant testing fire from the Liberal opposition, and Bob Such, whose small “l” liberal credentials fit comfortably, it seems, with Rann’s vision and his cabinet’s caution. The campaign and the result The 2002 SA election result represents further expression of contemporary voter disdain toward the major parties. Labor formed government on the foundation of a mere 36 per cent primary vote, its lowest since 1941. The centrepiece of the Lewis-Rann deal (a “compact” modelled closely on that struck between Victorian Premier, Steve Bracks, and the three Victorian <b>independents)</b> is the <b>promise</b> of a constitutional convention aimed at promoting significant parliamentary reform (more on this in a moment). The main issues of the campaign were, as one would expect, health, education, law and order and, from time to time, the environment. For voters a swirl of statistics surrounded the various promises and the majority, who are not accountants, could well be excused for turning off. Labor’s low primary vote is explained partly by a campaign strategy which focused too much on anti-privatisation. As commentators pointed out, what is left to privatise? Moreover, the legacy of the collapse of the State Bank and the need to relieve the debt was well recognised - and, arguably, privatisation of electricity was grudgingly accepted by SA voters as not so much an “ideological” good as a necessary bad in terms of reducing the state’s high level of government debt. Rann was certainly more attuned with voters on the question of electricity pricing; here his proposal to institute a new regulatory regime under the auspices of an Essential Services Commission was both good policy and a vote winner. The campaign of the Liberal leader, Rob Kerin, sought to appeal to a populist anti-politician mood, and while it would probably befuddle professional campaign managers, it was generally thought to have worked well. His TV advertisements opened with the words: “People joke, ‘Trouble with elections is that whoever you vote for you always end up with a politician’” and promised a “no nonsense” approach. Just what this might mean in practice is anyone’s guess, but the message helped to sharpen a contrast between the slick Rann and the plain-spoken Kerin. The most notable feature of the results for the House of Assembly and the Legislative Council was the Liberals’ failure to win sufficient seats to govern after winning the majority of the both the primary and two-party-preferred vote. This is a particular irony for students of SA politics given that after the 1989 State election the Electoral Act was amended to redraw boundaries after each election with the intent of “ensuring” that the party with a two party preferred majority would win sufficient seats to govern! Also notable is the sharp decline of the Democrat vote in both houses, a result which ranks with those of the late 1970 s and early 1980 s and has fuelled a range of opinion as to its source. Others can debate its relationship to Stott-Despoja’s leadership, but it is worth noting the competition the Democrats face for the protest vote from other parties and independents contributed to the decline, especially in the Legislative Council. Not foreseen at the campaign’s opening was the role the new party, Family First, would play in both delivering a healthy preference flow to the Liberals and in securing an upper house seat. With links to the Assemblies of God church and a very well financed campaign - plus ample foot soldiers at polling booths - this party has stamped its mark and may well increase its presence at the next state election. Labor in government It is far too early to judge the Rann government except to note that Premier Mike Rann, Deputy Premier and Treasurer Kevin Foley and Environment Minister John Hill have presented a competent face for the government. It will be interesting to report in six months on Lea Stevens (Health, Assisting the Premier in Social Inclusion) and Jane Lomax-Smith (Tourism, Employment, Training and Further Education) as both hold, in terms of the media attention they attract, difficult ministries, are inexperienced and likely targets of concerted opposition attack. The Constitutional Convention, the big event in SA politics for 2003, is currently being planned. The convention represents a key plank of the deal struck between Rann and Lewis and sees Lewis prominent in the planning process. In making the deal with Rann, Lewis stated he was keen to see parliamentary reform and believed the Liberals could not be trusted to deliver. Others will argue it was Labor’s offer of the House speakership (and the income it accrues) that was the key; whatever the case, the outcome now sees a process of citizen involvement in what is likely to be important parliamentary reform. Based on the principles of “deliberative democracy” the convention will attract considerable national attention, in particular with regard to the key issues it will consider, namely, reduction of the number of MPs, changes to parliamentary procedure, no ministers in the upper house and possible abolition of the upper house. Estimated to cost $ 570, 000, the process will involving a series of meetings with citizens chosen randomly from the electoral role with the aim of constituting a final convention of around 300 citizens who will deliberate, debate and discuss - with advice from “experts” - then vote in what {{is expected to be a}} binding manner with regard to government presenting issues at a future referendum.
