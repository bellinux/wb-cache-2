25|$|A second work of fiction, {{provisionally}} titled Crazy House: Further Adventures in Chicago, contains over 10,000 handwritten pages. Written after The Realms, {{it takes}} that epic's major characters—the seven Vivian sisters and their companion/secret brother, Penrod—and places them in Chicago, with the action unfolding {{during the same}} years {{as that of the}} earlier book. Begun in 1939, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tale</b> <b>of</b> a house that is possessed by demons and haunted by ghosts, or has an evil consciousness of its own. Children disappear into the house and are later found brutally murdered. The Vivians and Penrod are sent to investigate and discover that the murders are the work of evil ghosts. The girls go about exorcising the place, but have to resort to arranging for a full-scale Holy Mass to be held in each room before the house is clean. They do this repeatedly, but it never works. The narrative ends mid-scene, with Darger having just been rescued from the Crazy House.|$|E

500|$|As {{a result}} of their {{widespread}} popularity, especially in households with children, guinea pigs have shown a presence in culture and media. Some noted appearances of the animal in literature include the short story [...] "Pigs Is Pigs" [...] by Ellis Parker Butler, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tale</b> <b>of</b> bureaucratic incompetence. Two guinea pigs held at a railway station breed unchecked while humans argue as to whether they are [...] "pigs" [...] or [...] "pets" [...] for the purpose of determining freight charges. Butler's story, in turn, inspired the [...] episode [...] "The Trouble With Tribbles", written by David Gerrold. In the Golden Hamster Saga books, two guinea pigs named Enrico and Caruso are modern-day thespians (named after Enrico Caruso) who serve as secondary characters, and often irritate the main character, Freddy Auratus, who strongly dislikes their acting antics.|$|E
500|$|The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tale</b> <b>of</b> pursuit and prey.

Potter was following the pattern of fairy tales by dwelling {{on the theme of}} pursuit and prey, and often pointed out that the tale of Jemima was a retelling of [...] "Little Red Riding Hood". Perrault's tale ends with the death of the heroine, but Potter understood children will not tolerate tragedy. The prey in her books survive for better or worse (Peter returns home for a dose of chamomile tea, for example) and, though Jemima loses her eggs to her hungry rescuers, she lives to return to the farm to raise a brood of ducklings.|$|E

The song's themes include maturity and the refrain, [...] "Well I guess this is growing up." [...] "Dick Lips" [...] was named after an insult bandied around at Big Fish during recording. It was written about DeLonge's experience when he was kicked out of Poway High School for showing up to a basketball game while intoxicated. [...] "Waggy" [...] was a word Hoppus created while belching, prompting him to name the song with it. [...] "Untitled" [...] is inspired by the emerging ska punk scene, and [...] "Emo" [...] by its namesake, which is partly a tribute to DeLonge's favorite band, Jimmy Eat World.|$|E

[...] "I told Ben [...] I {{wanted to do a}} song that had elements of rock and roll but with a techno vibe and he ran with it, creating a slamming heavy metal guitar intro on an insanely hyper track." [...] The song is about a dominant female who nurses a broken heart as she sings, [...] "Let me kiss it and make it better/After tonight you will forget her". [...] "Fallen Angel" [...] is also an up-tempo techno-trance song with elements of ambient music. It features Spanish guitar and castanets. The lyrics were influenced by and written surrounding the death of Kurt Cobain. The third track, [...] "Good-N-Evil", incorporates elements of industrial music. [...] "Fly" [...] is a mid-tempo song built around a trip hop beat. The album's fifth track and the only ballad on the album, [...] "Distant Land", contains elements of ambient music and features mellow guitar melody.

2500|$|Jeffrey Richards {{describes}} a European [...] "medieval masculinity which was essentially Christian and chivalric". Courage, respect {{for women of}} all classes and generosity characterize the portrayal of men in literary history. The Anglo-Saxons Hengest and Horsa and Beowulf are examples of medieval masculine ideals. According to David Rosen, the traditional view of scholars (such as J. R. R. Tolkien) that Beowulf <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tale</b> <b>of</b> medieval heroism overlooks the similarities between Beowulf and the monster Grendel. The masculinity exemplified by Beowulf [...] "cut men off from women, other men, passion and the household".|$|E

[...] As Yim has made clear in interviews and his writings, Xuanzhang is one of his favorite subjects, likely for reasons relating to his own life story and the difficult path he has had to travel as an artist and a man.|$|E

2500|$|In the [...] "coming-of-age" [...] interpretation, Hal's {{acquaintance}} with Falstaff and the tavern lowlife humanises him and provides {{him with a}} more complete view of life. At the outset, Prince Hal seems to pale {{in comparison with the}} fiery Henry Percy, the young noble lord of the North (whom Shakespeare portrays considerably younger than he was in history in order to provide a foil for Hal). Many readers interpret the history as a tale of Prince Hal growing up, evolving into King Henry V, perhaps the most heroic of all of Shakespeare's characters, in what <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tale</b> <b>of</b> the prodigal son adapted to the politics of medieval England. The low proportion of scenes featuring the title character, the king, has also been noted, with some authors suggesting that the play contrasts the authority of Henry IV, and his struggle to stay in control of the situation, with the chaotic forces of the rebels and Falstaff.|$|E
2500|$|Recent {{historians have}} {{emphasized}} the multicultural nature of the frontier.

They explain, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tale</b> <b>of</b> conquest, but also one of survival, persistence, and the merging of peoples and cultures that gave birth and continuing life to America." [...] The first settlers in the west were the Spanish in New Mexico; they became U.S. citizens in 1848. The Hispanics in California ("Californios") [...] were overwhelmed by over 100,000 gold rush miners. California grew explosively. San Francisco by 1880 had become the economic hub of the entire Pacific Coast with a diverse population of a quarter million.|$|E

[...] They explain, [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tale</b> <b>of</b> conquest, but also one of survival, persistence, and the merging of peoples and cultures that gave birth and continuing life to America." [...] Through treaties with foreign nations and native tribes; political compromise; military conquest; establishment of law and order; the building of farms, ranches, and towns; the marking of trails and digging of mines; and the pulling in of great migrations of foreigners, the United States expanded from coast to coast, fulfilling the dreams of Manifest Destiny. Historian Frederick Jackson Turner in his [...] "Frontier Thesis" [...] (1893) theorized that the frontier was a process that transformed Europeans into a new people, the Americans, whose values focused on equality, democracy, and optimism, as well as individualism, self-reliance, and even violence. Thus, Turner's Frontier Thesis proclaimed the westward frontier to be the defining process of American history.|$|E
