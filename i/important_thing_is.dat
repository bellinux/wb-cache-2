5|$|After {{interrogation}} by Doggett, Purnell {{confesses to}} snatching Billy in 1990 {{on behalf of}} someone else. Doggett recognizes Purnell was also a victim, and with enough prodding, gets a name: Cal Jeppy. The police and the two FBI agents go to Jeppy’s home and find Josh in a compartment under {{the floor of his}} horse trailer. Doggett chases Jeppy into the woods, catches him, and discovers the skull of Billy that Purnell dug up earlier. As the Underwoods stand over the shallow grave of their long dead son, Scully and Doggett discuss the case. Scully believes it was justice from beyond the grave and that the <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that it saved Josh Underwood.|$|E

25|$|The Subjectivist view {{argues that}} it is not {{necessary}} to think of religious experiences as evidence for the existence of an actual being whom we call God.

25|$|Appropriate {{amounts of}} {{supplemental}} zinc and potassium {{should be added}} if available. But the availability of these should not delay rehydration.

The <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that the basic system which runs through all the mystery religions, whether they come from Tibet or the pyramids of Egypt, is backed up by you. It's actually the right system.|$|E

25|$|The {{proportion}} of females {{as a predictor}} of c was largely mediated by social sensitivity (Sobel z = 1.93, P= 0.03) which is in vein with previous research showing that women score higher on social sensitivity tests. While a mediation, statistically speaking, clarifies the mechanism underlying the relationship between a dependent and an independent variable, Wolley agreed {{in an interview with the}} Harvard Business Review that these findings are saying that groups of women are smarter than groups of men. However, she relativizes this stating that the actual <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> the high social sensitivity of group members.|$|E
25|$|Appeal in {{a cartoon}} {{character}} corresponds {{to what would}} be called charisma in an actor. A character who is appealing is not necessarily sympathetic – villains or monsters can also be appealing – the <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that the viewer feels the character is real and interesting. There are several tricks for making a character connect better with the audience; for likable characters a symmetrical or particularly baby-like face tends to be effective. A complicated or hard to read face will lack appeal, it may more accurately be described as 'captivation' {{in the composition of}} the pose, or the character design.|$|E
25|$|The cosmic {{experiment}} {{envisioned by}} Wheeler {{could be described}} either as analogous to the interferometer experiment or as analogous to a double-slit experiment. The <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> that by a third kind of device, a massive stellar object acting as a gravitational lens, photons from a source can arrive by two pathways. Depending on how phase differences between wavefunction pairs are arranged, correspondingly different kinds of interference phenomena can be observed. Whether to merge the incoming wavefunctions or not, and how to merge the incoming wavefunctions can be controlled by experimenters. There are none of the phase differences introduced into the wavefunctions by the experimental apparatus as {{there are in the}} laboratory interferometer experiments, so despite there being no double-slit device near the light source, the cosmic experiment is closer to the double-slit experiment. However, Wheeler planned for the experiment to merge the incoming wavefunctions by use of a beam splitter.|$|E

25|$|Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong {{attended}} the day's meetings. The Program of Seminars ends {{on this day}} and delegates discussed {{about the future of}} global economy, poverty and the future of Asia. Ministers {{of the members of the}} International Monetary Fund approved a plan to give more powers and voting rights to People's Republic of China, Mexico, South Korea and Turkey. This vote had 90.6% of the members supporting the move. However, the IMF remains dominated by Europe, the United States and Japan. China has less power in the IMF, although its economy is larger than Belgium and Netherlands combined. The IMF and World Bank have been criticised by Brazil, Argentina, Asian and African nations for prescribing severe belt-tightening measures during their economic crisis. The American government sees the reform of the IMF to redress global economic imbalances, which were cited as one of the biggest menaces to world growth. The IMF is stepping up in its financial surveillance through multilateral consultations to make it more effective and relevant. The World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz said that the poor should not be abandoned because their governments are weak, otherwise the people would be penalised twice. The IMF and World Bank see the need to combat corruption in developing countries. The World Bank will work with developing countries by working with countries or offered through projects on the countries itself. Wolfowitz said that the issue of governance is being addressed, and the most <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to take the principles in the paper, applying it in terms of budget allocation. Matters may be complicated due to lack of political will. He added that working with developing countries is a starting point and must work with banks, global organisations and other governments to stop corruption in their nations. African nations also called for more voting rights in the IMF for countries in their continent, at forums held in Africa itself.|$|E

500|$|Harvey {{possesses}} {{an expansive}} contralto vocal range. Harvey dislikes repeating {{herself in her}} music, resulting in very different-sounding albums. In an October 2004 interview with Rolling Stone, she said: [...] "when I'm {{working on a new}} record, the most <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to not repeat myself... that's always my aim: to try and cover new ground and really to challenge myself. Because I'm in this for learning." [...] While her musical style has been described as alternative rock, punk blues, art rock, and avant-rock, she has experimented with various other genres including electronica, indie rock and folk music.|$|E
500|$|Before {{he played}} in {{first-class}} cricket, Boycott played for the successful Barnsley Cricket Club, making his debut in 1959 and becoming a regular team member that year alongside Dickie Bird, Bill Foord and Michael Parkinson. In one match, Boycott faced a delivery from Foord which he dispatched to the boundary for four. Foord turned to Parkinson and asked: [...] "Christ almighty, what's this lad's name?"

[...] Hysén, the man of the match, said of his centre-back partner Hansen: [...] "It is so easy playing alongside Alan. He tells you where to go and what position to take up."

500|$|Arsenal {{entered the}} {{competition}} in the third round, {{by virtue of their}} Premier League status. Their opening match was a 3–1 win against Second Division Blackpool, where Grimandi, Adams and Overmars got themselves on the scoresheet. In the fourth round, Arsenal faced Leicester City at Highbury. The match ended goalless, meaning a replay was staged at Filbert Street. With neither side able to score in the 90 minutes and extra time, the game was settled on penalties. Leicester goalkeeper Pegguy Arphexad blocked Dixon and Grimandi's spot-kicks to help his side win. Wenger said he was [...] "upset" [...] with the loss, adding [...] "the most <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> the championship and we have to concentrate on it." ...|$|E

[...] The FA also intended to prevent any interference made by the Charity Commission into where money raised by the game should go.

Of course, as the main character, you really want to make sure he will charm the audience, which brings a special kind of pressure." [...] Walsh said, [...] "The most <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> to capture the spirit of the character, not necessarily a literal copy of the 2D. Puppets have their own kind of energy {{and you have to be}} careful about what to include and what to leave out."
