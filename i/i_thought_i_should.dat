500|$|Karthi {{was born}} on 25 May 1977 in Madras (now Chennai), Tamil Nadu, India. He had his {{schooling}} at Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan and St. Bede's Anglo Indian Higher Secondary School, Chennai. He gained a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Crescent Engineering College, Chennai. After graduation, he worked as an Engineering consultant in Chennai and considered higher studies abroad. [...] "I was earning about [...] 5000, per month and found the work monotonous. That was when <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> do something more", he recalled in an interview. Karthi got a scholarship for his higher studies in the United States, and enrolled at Binghamton University, New York, where he earned his Master of Science in Industrial Engineering. While pursuing his masters, he also attended lectures on filmmaking.|$|E
2500|$|When Maroney was 9 years old, {{she started}} {{training}} at Gym-Max in Costa Mesa, California. In 2012, she said, [...] "I realized that I {{had a dream}} that I {{wanted to go to}} the Olympics and I wanted to go as far as I could go. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> probably move to a new gym and start thinking about the Olympics." ...|$|E
2500|$|As I chose on all {{occasions}} {{to appear as}} a Christian, I was told by some of them , that I {{was the only person}} they had ever met with, of whose understanding they had any opinion, who professed to believe Christianity. But on interrogating them on the subject, I soon found that they had given no proper attention to it, and did not really know what Christianity was ... Having conversed so much with unbelievers at home and abroad, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be able to combat their prejudices with some advantage, and with this view I wrote ... the first part of my ‘Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever’, in proof of the doctrines of a God and a providence, and ... a second part, in defence of the evidences [...] of Christianity.|$|E
60|$|I {{nodded and}} went on. I {{went on to}} our chamber, for there <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> find Otomie.|$|R
60|$|My word, I {{could hardly}} believe my ears! <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have had my {{regiment}} at the least.|$|R

2500|$|Hatfield was {{profiled}} {{in a number}} of girls' magazines at this time and was embraced by many pre-teen and teenage girls as a role model due to the positive way she addressed serious issues faced by young women in her songs and interviews. About this period she says: [...] "I was never comfortable with the attention. I thought it had come too soon. I hadn’t earned it yet." [...] She gained notoriety in 1992 for saying that she was still a virgin in her mid-twenties in Interview magazine. In a 1994 interview for the magazine Vox, she said she was surprised by the effect 'outing' herself had: [...] "I {{think there are a lot}} of people out there who don't care about sex, but who you never hear from, so <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> say it. The magazine I did the interview for is full of beef-cake hunky guys and scantily-clad models, so I thought it would be really funny to say that I didn't care about sex in a magazine that's full of sex and beauty – but no one really got the joke." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of the 20th of last month, in the choir, after I had celebrated Mass I yielded to a {{drowsiness}} similar to a sweet sleep. [...] I saw before me a mysterious person similar to the one I had seen on the evening of 5 August. The only difference was that his hands and feet and side were dripping blood. This sight terrified me and what I felt at that moment is indescribable. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have died if the Lord had not intervened and strengthened my heart which was about to burst out of my chest. The vision disappeared and I became aware that my hands, feet and side were dripping blood. Imagine the agony I experienced and continue to experience almost every day. The heart wound bleeds continually, especially from Thursday evening until Saturday. Dear Father, I am dying of pain because of the wounds and the resulting embarrassment I feel deep in my soul. I am afraid I shall bleed to death if the Lord does not hear my heartfelt supplication to relieve me of this condition. Will Jesus, who is so good, grant me this grace? Will he at least free me from the embarrassment caused by these outward signs? I will raise my voice and will not stop imploring him until in his mercy he takes away, not the wound or the pain, which is impossible since I wish to be inebriated with pain, but these outward signs which cause me such embarrassment and unbearable humiliation....the pain was so intense that I began to feel as if I were dying on the cross.|$|E
60|$|MRS. GWYN. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{have more}} confidence; <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{be able to}} face it better in London, if you came down here openly--and now--I feel I must n't speak or look at you.|$|E

30|$|His {{explanation}} {{reveals a}} lack of understanding. For this reason, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> emphasize the issue of domain specificity in subsequent lessons.|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have dropped. I durstn't {{look at the}} Major; but I {{know what}} his state was, without looking at him.|$|E

500|$|<b>I</b> never <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> live to hear Arnold Schoenberg sound tame, yet tame he sounds—almost timid and halting—after Ornstein who is, most emphatically, {{the only}} true-blue, genuine, Futurist {{composer}} alive." ...|$|R
60|$|THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. We are {{perfectly}} {{familiar with it}} in Baghdad, madam; but <b>I</b> little <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> live to have it ignominiously applied to myself. You have actually Kiplingized me.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed. If <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> so, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{not be here}} to {{tell you}} what <b>I</b> <b>thought.</b> It is because <b>I</b> believe that you are injured that I am here." ...|$|R
