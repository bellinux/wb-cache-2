40|$|A physically-based {{parametric}} model (PPM) {{to predict}} the sky-noise temperature in all weather conditions is proposed. The proposed prediction model {{is based on the}} non-linear regression fit of numerical simulations derived from the sky-noise eddington radiative-transfer model (SNEM) in an absorbing and scattering medium such as gaseous, cloudy and rainy atmosphere. The PPM prediction method, dependent on measured path attenuation, beacon frequency, and antenna-pointing elevation angle, describes the statistical behavior of the atmospheric mean radiative temperature, which in its turn relates sky-noise temperature to slant-path attenuation. PPM validity ranges from X- to W- band and from 10 degrees to 90 degrees in terms of elevation angle. A comparison of the <b>estimated</b> <b>PPM</b> radio-propagation variables with corresponding ITALSAT satellite data, collected at the Spino d'Adda receiving station (Italy), is also carried out and discussed. The PPM prediction technique provides a root-mean-square retrieval error generally less than 8 K for all frequencies.

For this, we have first developed a statistical model of the performances and possible test measures of the Circuit Under Test (a Low Noise Amplifier). The statistical multi-normal model is derived from data obtained using Monte-Carlo circuit simulation (five hundred iterations). This statistical model is then used to generate a larger circuit population (one million instances) from which test metrics can be <b>estimated</b> with <b>ppm</b> precision at the design stage, considering just process deviations. With the use of this model, a trade-off between defect level and yield loss resulting from process deviations is used to set test limits. After fixing test limits, we have carried out a fault simulation campaign to verify the suitability of the different test measurements, targeting both catastrophic and single parametric faults. Catastrophic faults are modelled by shorts and opens. A parametric fault is defined as the minimum value of a physical parameter that causes a specification to be violated. Test metrics are then evaluated for the LNA case-study. As a result, test metrics for functional measurements such as S-parameters and Noise Figure are compared with low cost test measurements such as RMS and peak-to-peak current consumption and output voltage, input/output impedance, and the correlation between current consumption and output voltage...|$|R

40|$|Historical papers {{vary widely}} in their {{apparent}} stability. Knowledge of elemental concentrations can sometimes {{explain why some}} papers are found in browned and brittle condition and others are not. High concentrations of K, Al and S in such papers, for instance, are likely associated with alum; an acidic compound. Papers still durable and light in color may contain high levels of Ca; likely in association with calcium carbonate or other compounds known {{to act as an}} alkaline reserve in paper, helping them maintain an alkaline pH over time. Determination of these elemental concentrations in artifacts on paper can help the preservation specialist make more informed decisions about the efficacy of various aqueous intervention treatments or storage protocol options. XRF is an especially effective non-destructive technique for elemental analysis where the density of elements of interest is high, as in the analysis of modern metals. XRF analysis of historical paper, however, is made difficult by its minimal thickness, lack of density, and usually low concentrations of key elements of interest; Al, K, S, Mg, Fe, Cu and Ca. Quantitative analysis is made more difficult by the wide variation in thickness and density of papers made in Europe between 1300 and 1800. A technique was developed to correct for the variation in paper thickness and density by placing a thin film impregnated with Cr and Br behind the paper specimen. Variations in Cr and Br signal strength and backscatter in a selected region of the spectrum allowed us to generate a ‘thickness/density’ value that became part of the final calibration. A special acrylic accessory was constructed and mounted to a Bruker TRACeR III-V handheld instrument to position the Cr/Br thin film in the same location behind paper specimens during calibration and analysis of unknowns. 40 historical paper specimens were used in the calibration set; 36 to establish the calibration, and 4 to validate the accuracy of the final calibration. Samples from 10 spots were taken from each specimen and combined into one sample for destructive inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) analysis [...] The ICP-OES data for each specimen therefore represent an average result for the 10 spots. XRF analyses near each of the 10 spots used for the ICP-OES sampling were collected and then summed before being used in the calibration. We assume this summed scan corresponds to the average result obtained through ICP-OES. Using this technique, our calibration allows us to <b>estimate</b> <b>ppm</b> concentrations of K, S, Ca, and Fe with a precision of +/- 20 % at a 90 % confidence level when concentrations are close to 1000 ppm. Precision improves at higher concentrations, and is poorer at lower concentrations. Compositional variation must also be considered. For instance, precision is generally better with Ca, due to its high concentration. Fe was present in the calibration specimens in a narrower range making the accuracy outside of this range poorer. The precision for S is not as good as for K due to decreased instrument sensitivity for lighter elements. However, we believe this level of precision is adequate for documenting trends in the concentrations of alum (potassium aluminum sulfate or aluminum sulfate), Ca compounds, and Fe in hundreds of specimens over the centuries, or for documenting the average concentrations in large collections or collection subsets. Our parameters for precision result from a review of repeated measurements made on 4 samples held back from the calibration. The precision reported with the results is the propagated variance and agrees with the direct measurements. The accuracy of the results on the 4 samples not used in the calibration, for which we had ICP-OES results, showed variations distributed fairly evenly above and below the ICP-OES values indicating that the accuracy was much better than the precision. We are currently evaluating results from a new experiment designed to determine if this technique can be used to monitor changes in single artifacts during aqueous treatment. The precision may improve over what we obtained when analyzing widely differing unknowns because single artifacts provide the same or a very similar paper thickness/density from analysis to analysis. In the meantime, we believe the method is useful at its present level of development for collections surveys. Again, such data can provide valuable information to preservation specialists who make collections care and treatment decisions...|$|R

A risk assessment is conducted by comparing these external or intake dose estimates to appropriate (e. g., route-specific) exposure guidance values (e. g., Reference Dose or Reference Concentration) to assess whether exposures are exceeding levels of concern. Human biomonitoring, in which concentrations of chemicals are measured in blood or urine, is being increasingly used as an alternative or complementary exposure assessment. The Biomonitoring Equivalent, which is the translation of a Reference Dose to an equivalent concentration of a compound in blood or urine, provides a parallel means to interpret biomonitoring data {{in order to assess}} whether chemical-specific exposures exceed levels of concern. This manuscript presents a side-by-side comparison of the two approaches for assessing exposures and risks for a case study compound, 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D).

In several times due logistical issues, some of the ship transits between Spain and France were extending further north, up to the English Channel. This way, in the inner zone of English Channel were performed continuous measurements of pCO 2 in air and seawater, temperature, salinity, oxygen and fluorescence during Spring 2003 (20 transects) and Autumn 2003 (2 transects) and 2004 (3 transects). During Spring the surface waters of the Channel were strongly undersaturated, {{with a minimum of}} 260 µatm. The data were divided in two periods according to phytoplankton activity: the peak stage (March-April) and late stage (May-June). The relationship between the chlorophyll (Chla (mg/m 3)) and fCO 2 obtained in the bloom showed a high correlation coefficient (fCO 2 = 380 – 33. 3 * Chla (r 2 = 0. 83)). With zero chlorophyll level, fCO 2 reachs a close value to atmospheric equilibrium (time data serie of meteorological station of Mace Head (Irland) <b>estimated</b> 378 <b>ppm</b> of atmospheric pCO 2 in this period). The regression corresponding to the late stage yielded a significative correlation coefficient though less important than in bloom period (fCO 2 = 328 - 8. 2 * chla (r 2 = 0. 13)). During the autumn transects whole Channel was oversaturated in CO 2. The sea surface temperature (SST (ºC)) was the main factor controlling fCO 2 in September 2003, month of the maximum fCO 2 average according to Borges et al.

This relationship is consistent with the hypothesis suggested by Frankignoulle et al. (1996) that associates the autumn oversaturation with the entrance of warmer water from the North Atlantic. Air-sea fluxes obtained for the four studied periods were- 9. 3,- 9. 5, 11. 2 and 2. 5 mmol·m- 2 ·day- 1, respectively, that seems to confirm that English Channel is a continental shelf region with a high variation of surface CO 2 level and without a significant uptake of atmospheric CO 2 on an annual scale...|$|R
40|$|Breeding (RACB) Protocol. BORA was {{administered}} in the feed for 27 weeks to {{male and female}} Swiss (CD-I) mice at concentrations of 0, 1000, 4500, or 9000 <b>ppm.</b> <b>Estimated</b> doses, based on feed consumption and body weight, averaged 152, 636, and 1262 mg/kg body wt during Week 1 for males for 1000, 4500, and 9000 ppm, respectively. During 14 weeks of cohabitation, fertility of Fo mice was partially reduced at 4500 ppm and totally eliminated at 9000 ppm. No litters, dead or alive, were produced by 9000 ppm cohabited pairs. Among the litters born at 4500 ppm, live litter size and body weight were significantly reduced. A crossover mating trial of control and 4500 ppm groups confirmed the male as the affected sex, with fertility rates and the mating index significantly lower in the 4500 male X 0 ppm female group. At necropsy, after 27 weeks of BORA exposure, dose-related changes were present in Fo males for reduced body and reproductive organ weights, increased incidence of abnormal sperm, decreased sperm concentration and motility, and seminiferous tubule degeneration. In the 4500 ppm females, dietary BORA for 27 weeks caused significantly decreased weights of kidney/adrenals and livers; kidney/adrenal weight was also reduced in 4500 ppm males. The last litters of the control and 1000 ppm females, born in the 14 -week breeding phase, were reared to 74 days of age and then mated in nonsibling pair...|$|R
40|$|The acute oral LD 50 of Compound 1080 to magpies was {{estimated}} at 1. 78 mg/kg indoors, 1. 91 mg/kg outdoors in summer, and 2. 30 mg/kg outdoors in winter. Postmortem 1080 residues were detected in 75 of 76 treated birds. Higher doses yielded higher 1080 residues. Within dose levels, birds surviving longer carried lower residues. In a separate test, an average residue of 0. 09 ppm was found in 8 birds treated at 1. 59 mg/kg and euthanized 24 h post dosing. The adjusted dietary LC 50 of Compound 1080 to magpies tested indoors was <b>estimated</b> at 16 <b>ppm.</b> During LC 50 tests, the influence of 1080 on food consumption and bird weight varied. Birds receiving low doses were unaffected and those receiving high doses died quickly. Birds that were affected but did not die quickly, usually lost weight but only slightly reduced food intake. All birds that died had detectable 1080 residue in breast muscle. Birds fed higher 1080 dietary concentrations probably exhibited higher residues postmortem. Our adjusted average LD 50 (2. 12 mg/kg) appeared somewhat higher than reported in the literature; nonetheless, magpies {{are very sensitive to}} 1080. No sex differences were noted. Age, metabolic influences, or cold temperatures, might explain the high LD 50 value estimated for winter. The detection of 1080 residue in tissue samples is a useful tool for assessing 1080 exposure in magpies—but it might not be unequivocal...|$|R
50|$|In 1980, {{during a}} Bakke Mountain hike, the Bakke family noticed {{the region was}} quite breezy. The sparse tree growth was {{misshapen}} and deformed by the strong winds. Hans Bakke began {{to consider the possibility}} of wind energy at the site. EnXco, the wind-energy company and partner of the French energy conglomerate Électricité de France, approached the Bakke family to propose building a wind farm, together they created Hoosac Wind LLC. In November 2004, the State of Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection approved the proposed project. However, thorny issues plague the project including the presence of potentially vulnerable species of goldenrod {{in the vicinity of the}} proposed site, as well as the asserted danger to the migratory paths of birds and bats. Hoosac Wind achieved tentative approval from both Florida and Monroe after taking considerable amounts of wind-speed and direction data, along with avian, archeological, geological, and wildlife studies which were conducted as well. In January 2006, Hoosac Wind LLC was purchased by the British company PPM Energy for an <b>estimated</b> US$40 million, <b>PPM</b> was subsequently absorbed by Iberdrola Renewables. Hoosac Wind LLC was renamed New England Wind LLC. Green Berkshires, an environmental organization opposed to wind energy projects in the Berkshire mountain range, had filed an appeal rejected by the State of Massachusetts Division of Administrative Law Appeals. As of May, 2008, the project was still under review post environmental standards challenges. The project began construction in early 2012 and was completed in December 2012.|$|R
40|$|The {{average age}} of power {{transformers}} in Australia is about 25 - 35 years. Conventional oil tests, dissolved gas analysis (DGA) of oil, dielectric loss angle (DLA or tand) of windi g and recovery voltage monitoring (RVM) are among many diagnostic techniques available. Power and Water Authority (PAWA) of Northern Territory refurbished five 66 / 11 kV, 10 — 30 MVA, 24 — 33 years old transformers. From the test results {{it is observed that}} a transformer which has very good results from these diagnostic tests and even has minimum moisture content in the winding (from RVM) may still have very poor mechanical integrity. Winding cellulose paper may be aged to such an extent (assessed from degree of polymerisation; DP) that any sudden force or transient would cause failure. DP test is very difficult to perform regularly to ascertain mechanical integrity of winding paper. Furan analysis is another alternative to DP. Most of the times Furans are not detected and there is no universal correlation available for DP and Furans. Also, both ageing and moisture content influence Furans. Frequency response analysis (FRA) gives information regarding winding movement but it does not give much information about mechanical integrity of a winding which is essential for transformer reliability. This paper also compares moisture contents in the winding assessed from RVM and <b>estimated</b> from oil <b>PPM</b> (using Norris diagram) and estimated from winding DLA (based on Gussenbauer’s relationship). It appears that moisture content from RVM needs further validation and research to separate out ageing and moisture effects. 1...|$|R
40|$|A case–control study nested in the Health Watch {{cohort of}} {{petroleum}} industry workers, investigated whether the excess of lymphohematopoetic cancers, identified among male {{members of the}} Health Watch cohort, was associated with benzene exposure. Cases of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (n = 31),multiple myeloma (n = 15), and leukemia (n = 33) were identified between 1981 and 1999. Cases were age-matched to five controls. Exposure was retrospectively estimated for each occupational history using an algorithm in a relational database. Benzene exposure measurements, supplied by Australian petroleum companies, were used to estimate exposure for specific tasks. The tasks carried out within the job, the products handled, and the technology used,were identified from interviews with contemporary colleagues. More {{than half of the}} subjects started work after 1965 and had an average exposure period of 20 years. Exposure was low, 85 % of the cumulative exposure <b>estimates</b> were< 10 <b>ppm</b> years. Matched analyses showed that non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and multiple myeloma were not associated with benzene exposure. Leukemia risk, however, was significantly increased for the subjects with greater than 16 ppm years cumulative exposure, odds ratio (OR) 51. 9 (5. 6 – 477) or with greater than 0. 8 ppm intensity of highest exposed job. Cumulative exposures were similar to those found in comparable studies. The inclusion of occasional high exposures, for example, as a result of spillages, reduced the ORs, when the exposure was treated as either a continuous or a categorical variable. Our data demonstrate a strong association between leukemia and modest benzene exposure. The choice of cut-point and reference group has a marked effect on the ORs, but does not change the overall conclusions. <br /...|$|R
40|$|A {{major issue}} of Arctic marine science is to {{understand}} whether the Arctic Ocean is, or will be, a source or sink for air–sea CO 2 exchange. This has been complicated by the recent discoveries of ikaite (a polymorph of CaCO 3 · 6 H 2 O) in Arctic and Antarctic sea ice, which indicate that multiple chemical transformations occur in sea ice with a possible effect on CO 2 and pH conditions in surface waters. Here, we report on biogeochemical conditions, microscopic examinations and x-ray diffraction analysis of single crystals from a melting 1. 7 km 2 (0. 5 – 1 m thick) drifting ice floe in the Fram Strait during summer. Our findings show that ikaite crystals are present throughout the sea ice but with larger crystals appearing in the upper ice layers. Ikaite crystals placed at elevated temperatures disintegrated into smaller crystallites and dissolved. During our field campaign in late June, melt reduced the ice floe thickness by 0. 2 m per week and resulted in an <b>estimated</b> 3. 8 <b>ppm</b> decrease of p CO 2 in the ocean surface mixed layer. This corresponds to an air–sea CO 2 uptake of 10. 6 mmol m − 2 sea ice d − 1 or to 3. 3 ton km − 2 ice floe week − 1. This is markedly higher than the estimated primary production within the ice floe of 0. 3 – 1. 3 mmol m − 2 sea ice d − 1. Finally, the presence of ikaite in sea ice and {{the dissolution of the}} mineral during melting of the sea ice and mixing of the melt water into the surface oceanic mixed layer accounted for half of the estimated p CO 2 uptake...|$|R
40|$|An all-solid-state continuous-wave (cw) {{laser system}} for {{mid-infrared}} absorption {{measurements of the}} carbon monoxide (CO) molecule has been developed and demonstrated. The single-mode, tunable output of an external-cavity diode laser (ECDL) is difference-frequency mixed (DFM) with the output of a 550 -mW diode-pumped cw Nd:YAG laser in a periodically-poled lithium niobate (PPLN) crystal to produce tunable cw radiation in the mid-infrared. The wavelength of the 860 -nm ECDL can be coarse tuned between 860. 78 to 872. 82 nm allowing the sensor to be operated in the 4. 4 ? 4. 8 ?m region. Results from single-pass mid-IR direct absorption experiments for CO concentration measurements are discussed. CO measurements were performed in CO/CO 2 /N 2 mixtures in a room temperature gas cell that allowed {{the evaluation of the}} sensor operation and data reduction procedures. Field testing was performed at two locations: in the exhaust of a well-stirred reactor (WSR) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and the exhaust of a gas turbine at Honeywell Engines and Systems. Field tests demonstrated the feasibility of the sensor for operation in harsh combustion environments but much improvement in the sensor design and operation was required. Experiments in near-adiabatic hydrogen/air CO 2 -doped flames were performed featuring two-line thermometry in the 4. 8 ?m spectral region. The sensor concentration measurement uncertainty was estimated at 2 % for gas cell testing. CO concentration measurements agreed within 15 % of conventional extractive sampling at WSR, and for the flame experiments the repeatability of the peak absorption gives a system uncertainty of 10 %. The noise equivalent CO detection limit for these experiments was <b>estimated</b> at 2 <b>ppm</b> per meter, for combustion gas at 1000 K assuming a SNR ratio of 1...|$|R
