30|$|While {{the works}} in [2 – 5, 7] all {{considered}} minimizing the total transmit power of interference networks, another important performance metric, which concerns more {{about the quality of}} communications, is the mean-square-error (MSE) for signal estimation. In [8 – 10], the sum minimum MSE (MMSE) was considered to design iterative algorithms for MIMO interference relay systems taking the <b>direct</b> <b>links</b> between the source and destination nodes into consideration, and in [11], similar problem has been considered ignoring the <b>direct</b> <b>links</b> between the communicating parties. Indeed the <b>direct</b> source-destination <b>links</b> can {{play a vital role in}} wireless communication systems when the link-strength is significant. However, multihop communication is motivated by the fact that such <b>direct</b> <b>links</b> may undergo deep shadowing effects in many practical scenarios. Hence, many existing works on multihop communications have ignored the <b>direct</b> <b>links.</b> Nonetheless, the sum MMSE criterion runs the risk that some of the receivers may suffer from unacceptably high MSEs. Also, {{the works in}} [8 – 10] considered one-way relaying only.|$|R

30|$|In this section, {{we propose}} two {{scheduling}} algorithms {{applicable to the}} hybrid polling method: the packet-level and the connection-level scheduling algorithms. By performing the packet-level scheduling algorithm {{at the beginning of}} DCPIs, the AP can schedule efficiently the direct data transmissions requested on a packet basis. The connection-level scheduling algorithm derives the polling sequence for granting the transmission opportunities to the transmitting STAs of all existing established <b>direct</b> <b>link</b> connections. When polling the STAs in DCPIs, by a simple method, the AP modifies the polling sequence derived by the connection-level scheduling algorithm considering the information of the STAs' requests for the <b>direct</b> <b>link</b> communication. The connection-level scheduling algorithm is suitable for the case when the AP cannot perform the packet-level scheduling algorithm quickly enough to reflect exactly the STAs' new requests for the <b>direct</b> <b>link</b> communication in the next DCPI. However, in the cases where the connectivity and interference information and the information of the STAs' requests for the <b>direct</b> <b>link</b> communication do not change {{for a period of time}} during which the AP can derive the polling sequence by the packet-level scheduling algorithm or a small number of STAs actually request the <b>direct</b> <b>link</b> communication, the packet-level scheduling algorithm should be applied for the efficient use of the wireless bandwidth. Note that when no STA requests the <b>direct</b> <b>link</b> communication, the next DCPI will be skipped.|$|R

30|$|Observing {{the above}} summarization, {{we can find}} that, in {{existing}} works, the TWOR-NC-Nodir systems have been investigated widely. For the one with <b>direct</b> <b>link,</b> TWOR-NC-Dir, there is no open report yet. However, in practical implementation systems, such <b>direct</b> <b>link</b> between two sources is always existent. In half-duplex systems, the employed transmission protocol should be TDBC when the <b>direct</b> <b>link</b> is exploited. The reliability of TWOR-NC systems can be further improved when such practical existence direct transmission exploited. For the investigation of TWOR-NC-Dir systems, the canonical argument line [18] is that we must first obtain the statistical description of the instantaneous end-to-end SNRs for the systems without <b>direct</b> <b>link,</b> which includes cumulative distribution function (CDF), probability density function (PDF), moment generating function (MGF), etc. Besides this, the ones of <b>direct</b> <b>link</b> gains are also required. With these obtained statistical results of the system without <b>direct</b> <b>link,</b> we can investigate the TWOR-NC-Dir systems by employing some complicated mathematic manipulations such as (inverse) Laplace transformation, integral, etc. This mathematic manipulation requires that the statistical descriptions of the end-to-end SNRs for the systems without <b>direct</b> <b>link</b> should be given with simple closed-form expressions. However, observing the results given in [16, 17], we find {{that it is difficult}} to obtain the simple closed-form expressions of these statistics even if the lower bound expression (4) in [16] is considered. Motivated by these observations, the work contributes to a comprehensive comparison investigation for the TWOR-AFNC. We will first obtain the closed-form tight lower bound statistical descriptions for the TWOR-AFNC-Nodir, and then by using the derived tight lower bound we will study performance of the TWOR-AFNC-Dir systems.|$|R
