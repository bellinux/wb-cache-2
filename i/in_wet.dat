5|$|A {{saprobic}} species, Entoloma murrayi derives nutrients {{by breaking}} down organic matter. Fruit bodies are found <b>in</b> <b>wet</b> coniferous and deciduous forests, where they grow singly {{or in small}} groups {{on the ground in}} litterfall or humus, or in moss. Fruiting occurs in the summer and autumn.|$|E
5|$|Alligators {{have created}} an {{ecological}} niche <b>in</b> <b>wet</b> prairies; they dig at low spots with their claws and snouts and create ponds free of vegetation that remain submerged throughout the dry season. Alligator holes are integral {{to the survival of}} aquatic invertebrates, turtles, fish, small mammals, and birds during extended drought periods. Alligators feed upon animals that visit the hole.|$|E

5|$|A {{large number}} of the species grow in moist to wet soils with some growing even in shallow water. They are not very drought resistant, but the species now {{classified}} as Diplacus are. Some species grow in dry areas, others <b>in</b> <b>wet</b> habitats, such {{as members of the}} section Simiolus, which are hydrophilic. Both overall plant size and corolla size vary greatly throughout the genus. A minimum of 25 of the species are listed as threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Species are found at elevations from oceanside to high mountains as well as a wide variety of climates, though most prefer wet areas such as riverbanks.|$|E
5|$|Alex George {{described}} {{the plant in}} his 1981 monograph of the genus Banksia as a variety of Banksia integrifolia, but later reclassified it as a separate species. Genetic studies show it {{to be related to}} Banksia plagiocarpa, Banksia oblongifolia and Banksia robur. The species is found <b>in</b> <b>wet</b> sclerophyll forest and rainforest margins on sandy soils. Banksia aquilonia regenerates after bushfire by regrowing from epicormic buds under its bark. It is rarely cultivated.|$|E

5|$|Although slight {{changes in}} water level affect many species, {{the system as}} a whole also cycles and pulses with each change. Some transformations to the {{diversity}} of plant and animal life are natural, caused by fire or storms, and some are induced by humans, such as urban encroachment, the introduction of exotic species, and rapid global warming. Environmental conditions in the Everglades favor no particular species. Some species, such as snail kites and apple snails, do well <b>in</b> <b>wet</b> conditions, but wood storks and Cape Sable seaside sparrows (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis) do well in dryer circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Average annual {{precipitation}} ranges from , {{though it is}} generally unpredictable. More than 85% of annual rainfall occurs from October to March, which constitutes the warm season. In contrast, the winter months are dry. Eastern and southeastern areas of the region receive more precipitation than the western areas since they receive more summer rainfall. Precipitation is highly variable {{from year to year}} and appears to follow a cycle between dry and wet years in periods of about 2, 4–5, 6–8, and 16–22 years. <b>In</b> <b>wet</b> years, easterly winds caused by the subtropical South Atlantic High are stronger, causing moisture to flow towards this region; during dry years, these winds are weaker.|$|E
5|$|Brachycera are ecologically very diverse, {{with many}} being predatory at the larval stage and some being parasitic. Animals {{parasitised}} include molluscs, woodlice, millipedes, insects, mammals, and amphibians. Flies are {{the second largest}} group of pollinators after the Hymenoptera (bees, wasps and relatives). <b>In</b> <b>wet</b> and colder environments flies are significantly more important as pollinators. Compared to bees, they need less food as {{they do not need}} to provision their young. Many flowers that bear low nectar and those that have evolved trap pollination depend on flies. It is thought that some of the earliest pollinators of plants may have been flies.|$|E
50|$|Dominant grasses include big {{bluestem}} (Andropogon gerardi), switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) and Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans). <b>In</b> <b>wetter</b> areas, trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) and bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa) can be found.|$|R

5|$|Butterflies feed {{primarily}} on nectar from flowers. Some also derive nourishment from pollen, tree sap, rotting fruit, dung, decaying flesh, and dissolved minerals <b>in</b> <b>wet</b> sand or dirt. Butterflies are important as pollinators for some species of plants. In general, {{they do not}} carry as much pollen load as bees, but {{they are capable of}} moving pollen over greater distances. Flower constancy has been observed for at least one species of butterfly.|$|E
5|$|Entoloma murrayi, {{commonly}} known as the yellow unicorn Entoloma or the unicorn pinkgill, is a species of fungus in the Entolomataceae family. First described from New England (USA) in 1859, the species is found in eastern North America, Central and South America, and southeast Asia, where it grows on the ground <b>in</b> <b>wet</b> coniferous and deciduous forests. The fungus produces yellow mushrooms that have a characteristic sharp umbo {{on the top of a}} conical cap. The mushroom is inedible and may be poisonous. Other similar species can be distinguished from E.murrayi by differences in color, morphology, or microscopic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|High water volume <b>in</b> <b>wet</b> seasons {{does most}} of the downcutting in the main canyon. These flood events are {{responsible}} for transporting most of the 3millionshorttons (2.7millionmetrictons) of rock and sediment that the Virgin River transports yearly. The Virgin cuts away its canyon faster than its tributaries can cut away their own streambeds, so tributaries end in waterfalls from hanging valleys where they meet the Virgin. The valley between the peaks of the Twin Brothers is a notable example of a hanging valley in the canyon.|$|E

50|$|Hybrid Engelmann × {{white spruce}} is {{secondary}} to Douglas-fir, and occurs mainly <b>in</b> <b>wetter</b> subzones and at higher elevations transitional to the Montane Spruce, Sub-Boreal Spruce, and Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir Zones.|$|R
50|$|Often found {{growing in}} {{sphagnum}} and other acidic moss, <b>in</b> open <b>wet</b> areas <b>in</b> black spruce and/or tamarack bogs {{or on the}} boggy shores of lakes and <b>in</b> open <b>wet</b> meadows.|$|R
5|$|In second practice, Hamilton {{was again}} quickest {{but was also}} caught out again. He went off at the turn ten hairpin and crashed his car while {{he was doing a}} run on {{intermediate}} tyres <b>in</b> <b>wet</b> conditions– a downpour of rain affected {{the second half of the}} session. Most teams sent their drivers out only in the dry first half, setting times on the super-soft tyre compound. Ferrari looked to be significantly closer to Mercedes, with Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen finishing second and third respectively, less than 0.4 seconds behind Hamilton. Lotus confirmed their good pace from the first session when Pastor Maldonado was fifth fastest, behind Rosberg.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of Dunedin, it was {{impossible}} for a dray to reach the Caversham Valley <b>in</b> <b>wet</b> weather unless it went by a circuitous route around the hills. Valpy solved this problem by hiring men at his own expense to build a crude road from the southern end of Princes Street to his farm at Forbury. This formed the basis for later roads into the suburb. The road curved {{around the edge of the}} hills at the Glen to avoid a large swamp, the site of which is currently occupied by Carisbrook sports ground.|$|E
5|$|Larvae pupate 5 to 10cm {{below the}} soil surface. Pupae are brown in color; they measure 5.5mm wide and 17 to 22mm long. The biggest {{environmental}} factor {{that affects the}} pupal developmental rate is temperature, primarily soil temperature. This is because proper insulation facilitates development, and soil temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius correlate to higher pupal mortality. Another factor that influences pupal development is soil moisture. Pupal mortality is high <b>in</b> <b>wet</b> soil, where the moisture level is between 18 and 25 percent. Dehydration {{can also lead to}} high death rates among pupae, if soil moisture is as low as 1 to 2 percent.|$|E
