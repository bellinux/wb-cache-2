40|$|ABSTRACT: Polycyclic, non enolizable cycloaliphatic thioketones 1 a and 1 b react {{smoothly}} {{with the}} lithium salt of <b>diethyl</b> <b>methylphosphonate</b> 7 in THF solution at – 40 °C to afford {{products of the}} carbophilic attack exclusively. Quenching of the obtained lithium thiolates with alkyl iodides yields sulfanes of type 9 or 11, respectively, in good yields. 1 -Fluoro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene was shown {{to act as an}} arylating agent. In the case of the ‘cage’ thioketone 1 b, the carbanion of salt 7 approaches the C=S bond from the exo-side exclusively. In contrast to the parent carbonyl compounds, thioketones 1 show no tendency to undergo the conversion analogous to the Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction, which would result in the formation of an olefinic product...|$|E
40|$|The phase {{behavior}} of the binary systems consisting of the organic solvent <b>diethyl</b> <b>methylphosphonate</b> (DEMP) and the gases carbon dioxide (CO 2) and methane (CH 4) is experimentally studied. A synthetic method is {{used to measure the}} solubilities. Bubble-point pressures of the system DEMP + CO 2 are reported for CO 2 concentrations ranging from (15. 40 to 86. 44) mole % and within a temperature range of (283. 4 to 338. 1) K and compared to the limited experimental data in the literature. Also, bubble-point pressures of the system DEMP + CH 4 are reported for CH 4 concentrations ranging from (5. 17 to 15. 30) mole % and within a temperature range of (283. 2 to 358. 5) K, which have never been measured before. The solubilities of CH 4 are much lower than the solubilities of CO 2 in DEMP. Moreover, the temperature has a much larger influence on the CO 2 solubility in DEMP compared to the effect of temperature on the CH 4 solubility...|$|E
40|$|A {{new series}} of 4 -substituted [(1, 2, 3 -triazol- 1 -yl) acetamido]methylphosphonates as acyclic {{nucleotide}} analogs were synthesized from <b>diethyl</b> (2 -chloroacetamido) <b>methylphosphonate</b> via azidation followed by 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition with selected alkynes derived from natural nucleobases or their mimetics. All compounds were tested for their antiviral activities against DNA and RNA viruses {{as well as for}} cytostatic activity or cytotoxicity. Among all tested compounds, [(1, 2, 3 -triazol- 1 -yl) acetamido]methylphosphonate 6 e substituted with the N(3) -Bz-benzuracil moiety showed activity against the vesicular stomatitis virus (EC 50 [*]=[*] 45 [*]µM) in HeLa cell cultures. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This study {{describes}} the simple synthesis of new (quinazolin- 4 -ylamino) methylphosphonates via microwave irradiation. Substituted- 2 -aminobenzonitrile reacted with 1, 1 -dimethoxy-N,N-dimethylmethanamine at a reflux condition to obtain N'-(substituted- 2 -cyanophenyl) -N,N-dimethylformamidine (1). The subsequent reaction of this intermediate product with α-aminophosphonate (2) {{in a solution}} containing glacial acetic acid in 2 -propanol through microwave irradiation resulted {{in the formation of}} (quinazolin- 4 -ylamino) methyl-phosphonate derivatives 3 a to 3 x, which were unequivocally characterized by the spectral data and elemental analysis. The influence of the reaction conditions on the yield of 3 a was investigated to optimize the synthetic conditions. The relative optimal conditions for the synthesis of 3 a include a 1 : 1 molar ratio of N’-(2 -cyanophenyl) -N,N-dimethylformamidine to <b>diethyl</b> amino(phenyl) <b>methylphosphonate</b> and a 4 : 1 volume ratio of isopropanol to HOAc in the solvent mixture, at a reaction temperature of 150 °C, with a microwave power of 100 W and a corresponding pressure of 150 psi for 20 min in the microwave synthesizer. The yield of 3 a was approximately 79 %, whereas those of 3 b to 3 x were approximately 77 % to 86 %. Some of the synthesize...|$|R

40|$|A {{commercial}} Ion Mobility Spectrometer that {{is designed}} to detect Chemical Warfare Agents (CWAs), is modified by the addition of a second ion gate, and connected to a commercial Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer (ITMS). The addition of the second gate allows selection of individual ion mobility peaks for m/z analysis in the ITMS. This was demonstrated with the organophosphorus ester ions (CWA nerve gas simulants). The ITMS was used to perform isolation and fragmentation of the CWA simulants ions produced in the IMS. For the organophosphates dimethyl methylphosphonate, <b>diethyl</b> <b>methylphosphonate</b> and diisopropyl methylphosphonate, two ion mobility peaks were observed, which are shown to be the ammoniated monomer and ammoniated dimer ions. Using an ElectroSpray Ionisation (ESI) - ITMS, the fragmentation pathway of dimethyl ethylphosphonate (DMEP) is investigated. The isotopomers of DMEP have unusual fragmentations, and density functional theory calculations are used to aid in the interpretation of the mechanisms involved in these fragmentations. Of note, it is shown that entropy must be taken into consideration, and hence the free energy of the final transition involved in the mechanism, so that the true rate-limiting steps can be determined. Preliminary fragmentations using ESI-ITMS of eighteen other organophosphorus esters have been undertaken. These give an insight as to which fragmentations will require further investigations involving Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations and deuterated isotopomers to fully understand the mechanisms involved.
