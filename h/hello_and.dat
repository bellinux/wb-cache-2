500|$|According to Taylor's recollection, he {{was visiting}} McCartney {{at his home}} in St John's Wood, London, and asked the Beatle how he went about writing a song. In response, McCartney took Taylor into the dining room, where they both sat at a harmonium; McCartney then began playing the {{instrument}} and asked Taylor to call out the opposite to each word he happened to sing. Author Steve Turner writes of the result: [...] "And so it went – black and white, yes and no, stop and go, <b>hello</b> <b>and</b> goodbye." [...] Taylor later reflected: [...] "I've no memory at all of the tune... I wonder whether Paul really made up [...] that song as he went along or whether it was running through his head already." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2010, American {{alternative}} dance band LCD Soundsystem played [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] in concert, {{performing a}} verse {{of the song}} as a duet between James Murphy and keyboardist Nancy Whang. In May 2011, at 64th Cannes Film Festival, British singer-songwriter Jamie Cullum performed a piano medley of Frank Sinatra's [...] "New York, New York" [...] and [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] in honour of Robert De Niro. In February 2012, British singer Ed Sheeran did a soulful acoustic rendition of the song at BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge. Sheeran later sang it as a duet with Jason Mraz at the Jingle Ball Viewing Party in December 2012. In April 2012, British glam rock band Sweet released {{an updated version of}} the <b>Hello</b> <b>and</b> Ace Frehley hit single [...] "New York Groove" [...] that incorporated the chorus of [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] into its own chorus.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the sound of}} their studio recordings, Joy Division typically played loudly and aggressively during live performances. The band were unhappy with Hannett's mixing of Unknown Pleasures, which reduced the abrasiveness of their sound. According to Sumner, [...] "the music was loud and heavy, and we felt that Martin had toned it down, especially with the guitars". In concert, the group interacted little with the crowd; Paul Morley wrote, [...] "During a Joy Division set, outside of the songs, you'll be lucky to hear {{more than two or three}} words. <b>Hello</b> <b>and</b> goodbye. No introductions, no promotion". While singing, Curtis would often perform what was referred to as his [...] "'dead fly' dance", where the singer's arms would [...] "start flying in [...] semicircular, hypnotic curve". Simon Reynolds noted that Curtis's dancing style was reminiscent of an epileptic fit, and that he was dancing in the manner for some months before he was diagnosed with epilepsy. Live performances became problematic for Joy Division, due to Curtis's condition. Sumner later said, [...] "We didn't have flashing lights, but sometimes a particular drum beat would do something to him. He'd go off in a trance for a bit, then he'd lose it and have an epileptic fit. We'd have to stop the show and carry him off to the dressing-room where he'd cry his eyes out because this appalling thing had just happened to him".|$|E

In June of '69 they got a call—man down—it was Jones. They put the paddles on him, he was in VF, started CPR, zapped him, he came back to sinus rhythm, brought him into ER and three days later he was out and walking around. In gratitude, about a week later, he came down to Station 1, which he had never done before, and he {{said he would like to}} talk to the man who saved his life. They told me they had never seen Dan Jones in a clean shirt and sober, both of which he was that day. He would {{periodically}} come to the fire house and just say <b>hello</b> <b>and</b> he seemed to be sober. In my talks in those days I said this was the new cure for alcoholism. That was our first true save." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2003, Oberman {{returned}} to the National Theatre in Edmond, playing opposite Kenneth Branagh in her debut at the National and Branagh's return to acting {{after six years of}} directing. Her role as wife to Branagh's title character was well received by critics, Norman Miller in a BBC News review commending Oberman for making a particular [...] "impression" [...] despite being only one part out of thirty [...] "whirling through scenes" [...] in a play that runs barely over an hour. That year also saw her star in <b>Hello</b> <b>and</b> Goodbye at the Southwark Playhouse in what would be her final stage performance for four years. The play was highly acclaimed. According to Fiona Mountford in The Evening Standard, the production was [...] "given the outing of its life by" [...] Oberman and her co-star, Zubin Varla. The review in The British Theatre Guide was similarly positive, praising Oberman who [...] "rages away" [...] in the role of [...] "Hester", and delivers [...] "one of the best performances in town".|$|E
2500|$|Rodriguez {{made his}} 2013 return with the Yankees on August 5 {{on the same}} day MLB {{announced}} he would be suspended through the 2014 season, pending an appeal, {{for his role in the}} Biogenesis scandal. On August 11, Rodriguez hit his first home run of the season off Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander. With the home run, Rodriguez passed Stan Musial for fifth place in career RBIs. Rodriguez continued to feud with Yankees management following his return, as his lawyers accused the team, and specifically Christopher S. Ahmad MD, of mishandling his hip injury in several ways; Rodriguez's legal team contends the team withheld the injury from him and continued to play him in 2012 despite his health, and that team president Randy Levine told Rodriguez's hip surgeon that he would be happy if Rodriguez never played again. In response to the accusations, Cashman said, [...] "I'm not comfortable talking to Alex about this because we feel we are in a litigious environment. <b>Hello</b> <b>and</b> goodbye, that's about it." [...] He added, [...] "It's not just Yankees' management. He's putting it at the level of our trainers, our medical staff. The organization. The team." ...|$|E
