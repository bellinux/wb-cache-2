5|$|TumbleSeed is an indie action video game, {{created by}} {{developer}} Benedict Fritz and designer Greg Wohlwend, {{in which the}} player balances a rolling seed on an ascending, horizontally slanted vine past procedurally generated obstacles {{to reach the top}} of a mountain. It is based on the mechanical arcade game <b>Ice</b> <b>Cold</b> Beer and built partially through the Cards Against Humanity game incubation program. TumbleSeed was released in May 2017 to generally favorable reviews on macOS, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Windows platforms. Critics, in particular, appreciated their haptic sense of the rolling seed from the Nintendo Switch's sensitive HD Rumble. Many reviewers noted TumbleSeed intense and sometimes uneven difficulty, which the developers hoped to address in a post-release update. They credited this stigma and a tepid critical reception for the game's slow sales, but were proud of their work.|$|E

500|$|The game {{is based}} on <b>Ice</b> <b>Cold</b> Beer, a {{mechanical}} arcade game in which the player controls the ends of a metal rod to raise a rolling, metal ball vertically in a wooden cabinet while avoiding holes cut into the wood. The Chicago-based indie development team found the machine at an arcade where they competitively played the 2013 video game Killer Queen. Developer Benedict Fritz later prototyped a version of <b>Ice</b> <b>Cold</b> Beer in the Unity game engine with a simple white background and black, circular holes. His friend, designer Greg Wohlwend, who had previously worked on Threes and Ridiculous Fishing, saw a short, online video of Fritz's prototype and the two began {{to work together on}} the project by adding enemies, an in-game world, and procedurally generated levels. Their prototypes included dungeon crawl and open world, action-adventure genre explorations. They spent two years designing the title and wanted to honor and contribute to the legacy of <b>Ice</b> <b>Cold</b> Beer. They also worked through a Cards Against Humanity game incubation program in 2015, and several other indie developers based in Chicago joined the production: David Laskey, Jenna Blazevich, and composer Joel Corelitz. Based on the project's loose, collaboratory nature, Metro called the game's pedigree [...] "as indie as indie gaming gets". The team released a promotional trailer in August 2016 ahead of a demo at the PAX West game show.|$|E

He commented on Bågenholm's state: [...] "She has completely dilated pupils. She is ashen, flaxen white. She's wet. She's <b>ice</b> <b>cold</b> when I touch her skin, and she looks absolutely dead." [...] Gilbert had treated many cases of hypothermia before because of the cold climate in Norway, and knew how to treat Bågenholm.

500|$|Wohlwend's friend Benedict Fritz {{developed}} {{a prototype of}} a mechanical arcade game from a bar that they frequented in Chicago. When Wohlwend saw the video of <b>Ice</b> <b>Cold</b> Beer online, they began work on an open world, dungeon crawl version of the game, which became TumbleSeed. They also worked through a Cards Against Humanity game incubation program in 2015, and several other indie developers based in Chicago joined the production. Based on the project's loose, collaboratory nature, Metro called the game's pedigree [...] "as indie as indie gaming gets".

TumbleSeed was released on May 2, 2017, on Nintendo Switch, macOS, PlayStation 4, and Windows platforms. The developers credited the game's tepid critical reception and associated stigma of intense difficulty for the game's slow sales. While Wohlwend hoped that a post-release patch would resolve some of these issues, he did not expect the game to recoup its costs, though the team was proud of their product.|$|E

[...] He snaps back to his old self after witnessing a drinking contest between Tammy 1 and Tammy 0. [...] They then drink in order to win control over Ron. Leslie also enters this competition in hopes of freeing him of the Tammys, however she ends up failing miserably due to the high alcohol content of Swanson family mash and is the first one out of the contest. In the end, Ron finally comes to his senses and stands up for himself and tells both Tammys to leave.|$|E
