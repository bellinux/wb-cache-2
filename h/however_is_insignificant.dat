40|$|Contradicting the {{conventional}} wisdom of constant factor shares, the portion of national income accruing to labor has been trending downward {{in the last three}} decades. This decline must have contributed to rising inequality as labor income is more evenly distributed than capital income. This study contributes to the literature on income inequality by exploring the role of globalization in driving the labor share. In particular, we focus on the impacts of trade openness and foreign direct investments (FDI) on the labor share. Using country-level panel data for 1980 - 2010, the study finds that trade is a significant and robust determinant of labor share. Generally speaking, export depresses while import increases the labor share. The impact of FDI, <b>however,</b> <b>is</b> <b>insignificant.</b> These results are similar for both developed and developing countries...|$|E
40|$|A {{synthesis}} of the measured values of human male hand-arm impedance characteristics {{reported in the literature}} has been performed. The driving-point mechanical impedance data of the human hand-arm grasping a vibrating handle has been compared to highlight the various similarities and differences among the data. Unexplained differences among the results of various studies, conducted independently under nominally equivalent measurement conditions, led to the exclusion of outliers from the analysis. The most probable values of impedance phase and magnitude are defined by lower and upper envelopes of the mean values of the accepted data sets. The mean of the data sets, together with the smoothened envelopes, are used to define the target and range of idealized values of theXh,YhandZhcomponents of impedance in the 10 - 1000 Hz frequency range. A pooling of results from different studies suggests that there is a small dependence of theXhcomponent of impedance magnitude on the hand grip forces. The dependence of the phase of the corresponding impedance component on the hand grip force, <b>however,</b> <b>is</b> <b>insignificant.</b> There is insufficient data from independent sources to establish a dependence of other components of impedance on the hand grip and thrust forces.

If such were the case, we would expect to see an influence of HIV-related factors on young adults' educational expectations. Unlike previous analyses on expectations, this study therefore analyses the significance of orphanhood, health, subjective life expectancy, and perceived risk of HIV infection. Data were collected by the Cape Area Panel Study (CAPS), covering an original sample of about 5000 young adults within the Cape Town Metropolitan Area. Findings illustrate that educational expectations are in fact very high among young adults, especially among those of the most heavily affected African population group.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{the findings of}} a study of the resolution of motions to dismiss securities fraud lawsuits since the passage of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA) in 1995. Our sample consists of decisions on motions to dismiss in securities class actions by district and appellate courts in the Second and Ninth Circuits for cases filed after the passage of the Reform Act to the end of 2002. These circuits are the leading circuits for the filing of securities class actions and are generally recognized as representing two ends of the securities class action spectrum. Post-PSLRA, the Second Circuit applies the least restrictive pleading standard to securities claims and the Ninth Circuit applies the most restrictive. The Ninth Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s post-PSLRA reputation as being a tougher venue in which to win securities fraud class actions is borne out by a significantly higher dismissal rate. The differences between the two circuits are also reflected in factors that correlate with dismissal. For example, allegations of violations of accounting principles other than revenue recognition correlate negatively with dismissal in the Second Circuit. This coefficient, <b>however,</b> <b>is</b> <b>insignificant</b> in our regressions for the Ninth Circuit. Allegations of revenue recognition violations are insignificant in both circuits, regardless of whether the issuer has been forced to restate those revenues. The circuits part ways on other factors as well: the Second Circuit is significantly less likely to dismiss cases with allegations of false forward-looking statements, a surprising result given the stringent standards for such statements imposed by the PSLRA. The Ninth Circuit is significantly less likely to dismiss complaints with allegations of 2 ̆ 733 Act violations, and the Second Circuit is more likely to dismiss cases brought by the Milberg Weiss firm. When it comes to insider trading, however, both circuits are skeptical, and the allegations correlate with dismissal in both circuits...|$|E

This thesis considers adaptive set-point regulation of such systems by using the infinite-dimensional backstepping method. Two control methods are proposed. The first for a system where sensing is restricted to be collocated with actuation and anti-collocated with two unknown parameters in an affine boundary condition. The second for a system where sensing is non-collocated with actuation and where the uncertain boundary parameters, anti-collocated with actuation, appear in a bilinear form with two unknown parameters. Boundedness in the L 2 -sense and point-wise in space are proved. Convergence to the selected set-point at the left boundary is shown for both methods. Because the boundary parameters are unknown, the steady state solution achieving this set-point is also unknown, transforming the problem to a tracking problem with a parameter-estimate-dependent tracking objective. The parameter estimates are generated by a parameter update law operating on linear parametric models relating the system state estimates, measurements and boundary parameters. The theory is applied to the Kick and Loss Detection and Attenuation Problem in Managed Pressure Drilling, where the goal is to attenuate any sudden inflow into the well-bore or outflow into the reservoir by controlling the bottom-hole pressure from top-side actuation. In addition, the reservoir pressure and the relation between pressure difference and net inflow are unknown. Simulations show that compared to using constant top-side actuation, the derived methods provide a significant reduction in total inflow and convergence time before the kick/loss is completely attenuated. The method using non-collocated sensing performs marginally better than the method only using collocated sensing and control in terms of less overshoot and oscillations. The difference, <b>however,</b> <b>is</b> <b>insignificant</b> for the tested parameter values. Both methods are able to attenuate the kick/loss in a time close to the theoretical constraint imposed by the bottom-hole [...] top-side [...] bottom-hole propagation time...|$|E
40|$|This Ph. D. thesis {{addresses}} both {{theoretical and}} empirical issues pertaining to land management decisions of farm households in developing countries working under an imperfect market and institutional setting (with case studies from Ethiopia). Using techniques in experimental economics, efforts are also made to assign some quantitative measures to the most important parameters (such as risk and time preferences) in the same decision making process. Paper I: A Dynamic Economic Model of Soil Conservation with Imperfect Markets and Institutions In this paper, we develop a dynamic soil conservation model that explicitly incorporates labor, capital and land market imperfections and their interactions to suit the problems of smallholders in many developing countries. We use the model to analyze {{the impact of these}} institutional and market imperfections on the optimal levels of labor allocations into cultivation and conservation efforts. Increased transaction cost in factor markets is found to have a direct impact on soil conservation effort by increasing its shadow prices and curtailing its demand. It also has an indirect impact on soil conservation by affecting the shadow price of the soil stock and hence enhancing or curtailing its demand depending on the initial factor endowments of farm households, the relative strength of conservation and cultivation inputs on the soil dynamics, the profit share of cultivation input, and the degree of interaction across the factor markets. The overall impact is thus inconclusive. Various possible scenarios are explored in the model. Paper II: Risk Preferences of Farm Households in Ethiopia This study measures farmers’ attitudes towards risk using an experimental approach for a sample of 262 farm households in the Ethiopian highlands. We find more than 50 percent of the households in the severe to extreme risk aversion category, with a constant partial risk aversion coefficient of more than 2. 00. With careful construction of the experiment, the natures of absolute and partial risk aversion are examined, and our data supports the presence of Decreasing Absolute Risk Aversion (DARA) and Increasing Partial Risk Aversion (IPRA) behavior. The validity of some of the expected utility theory predictions is tested, and the predictions of risk neutrality for smaller stakes and predictions of similar preferences for gains and losses, which stem from the major tents of the theory (concavity and asset integration), are not supported by our experiment. Paper III: Time Preferences of Farm Households in Ethiopia This study measures farmers’ time preferences (subjective discount rates) using an experimental approach with monetary incentives for a sample of 262 farm households in the Ethiopian highlands. The median discount rates are found to be more than 43 percent, which are more than double the interest rate on the outstanding debt. Given imperfect credit markets, household wealth (physical asset) levels are found to be highly correlated to this attitude measure. Time frame and magnitude effects, and delay/speed up asymmetries are anomalies found in the experiment. Paper IV: Market Imperfections and Farm Technology Adoption Decisions: An Empirical Analysis In this paper, we investigate the impacts of market and institutional imperfections on farm technology adoptions in a model that considers fertilizer and soil conservation adoptions as related decisions. Controlling for plot characteristics and other factors, we find that a household’s decision to adopt fertilizers does significantly and negatively depend on whether the same household adopts soil conservation. The reverse causality, <b>however,</b> <b>is</b> <b>insignificant.</b> We also find outcomes of market imperfections such as limited access to credit, plot size, risk considerations, and rates of time preference to be significant factors explaining variations in farm technology adoption decisions.

Root length data showed that PGPR improved root length either alone or in combination with nematode; <b>however,</b> there <b>was</b> <b>insignificant</b> difference among the four PGPR strains. Results of aerial parts fresh weight measurements indicated that P. fluorescens, P. polymyxa, and B. subtilis enhanced the shoot fresh weight in contrast to control significantly.

In the present study, P. striata increased the plant growth parameters and decreased the growth and development indices of the RKN, but compared to other treatments subjected to PGPR, the least effect was observed on plant growth and nematode damage reduction. In an experiment, seed inoculation of pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.] with P. striata improved the root and shoot biomasses and higher P uptake by straw and grain (Gaind 2013).
