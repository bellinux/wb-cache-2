40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was to determine}} which of the four varieties of basil, Genovese, Nufar, Ethiopian, and Mrs. Lemon Burns, grown in an organic field and a conventional field, contains higher concentrations of Lutein. However, if organic production methods decrease the basil flavor then people will not buy the herb. A small portion of <b>fresh</b> Genovese <b>basil</b> was used for taste tests to see if people preferred organic or conventionally grown basil for taste, color, texture, etc. All four varieties of basil from both fields were harvested on the same day, stored at- 80 OC, and on a later date, the lutein was extracted with water and ethanol. Samples were put in a glass cuvette and read with a spectrophotometer where the computer takes transmitted light and converts it to an absorbance reading. This reading determines the amount of lutein in each sample. The data shows that Ethiopian has the highest lutein concentration. Also conventional basils have higher lutein concentrations than organically grown basil. Taste test scores showed little or no differences between the taste, texture, color, or aroma of conventional or organically grown basil which showed that organically produced basil will not ruin the taste and people will buy it...|$|R
