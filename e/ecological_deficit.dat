LCC can be evaluated commonly with two approaches, namely ecological footprint analysis (EFA) and the index system method (ISM). EFA is helpful to investigate the effects of different land categories whereas ISM {{can be used to}} evaluate the contributions of social, environmental, and economic factors. Here we compared the two LCC-evaluation approaches with data collected from Xiamen City, a typical region where rapid economic growth and urbanization are found in China. The results show that LCC assessments with EFA and ISM not only complement each other but also are mutually supportive. Both assessments suggest that decreases in arable land and increasingly high energy consumption have major negative effects on LCC and threaten sustainable development for Xiamen City. It is important for the local policy makers, planners and designers to reduce <b>ecological</b> <b>deficits</b> by controlling fossil energy consumption, protecting arable land and forest land from converting into other land types, and slowing down the speed of urbanization, and to promote sustainability by controlling rural-to-urban immigration, increasing hazard-free treatment rate of household garbage, and raising energy consumption per unit industrial added value.

40|$|The growing {{concerns}} {{on global}} climate change, biodiversity maintenance, natural resource conservation, and long-term ecosystem sustainability have been converting traditional single resource management into integrated ecosystem management. Ecoregions are large ecosystems of regional extent that contain smaller ecosystems of similar response potential and resource production capabilities. They {{can be used}} as a geographical framework for organizing and reporting resource information, setting bio-ecological recovery criteria, extrapolating site-level management experience to regions, and monitoring global changes. ^ The objective of this research is to develop a quantitative, multivariate regionalization model which is able to delineate ecoregions of multiple levels from remotely sensed data, and/or other in-situ data of environmental and land resource characteristics. The Spatial Pattern Analysis Model developed in this research uses a seeded and a non-seeded region-growing algorithm to generate spatially contiguous regions from polygonal primitive land units. Seeded region-growing assigns a land unit to a pre-defined seeded region at each step if the merge satisfies similarity criteria. The non-seeded method merges the most similar pair of neighboring units at each step until all units are grouped into one. ^ An ecoregion map of Nebraska with three hierarchical levels is developed with the model. In the mapping process, the STATSGO data set was used to build primitive map units. 66 clusters were initially grouped as Level III regions, 20 Level II regions and two Level I regions were generalized after further clustering. Environmental parameters include multi-temporal AVHRR data, soil rooting depth, organic matter content, available water capacity, growing degree days, and annual moisture <b>deficit.</b> <b>Ecological</b> characteristics of Level I and Level II regions are summarized from the GIS database and other natural resource and agricultural reports of the area. ^ Development of the Spatial Pattern Analysis Model provides a new approach of ecoregion mapping to resource managers and researchers.

30|$|The {{concept and}} {{calculation}} method of EF was {{put forward by}} Canadian ecological economist William E. Rees (1992). The further development and improvement about calculation principles and methods are given by his student Wackernagel. The theory is used for estimating the need of ecological productive space area sizes which sustain human natural resource consumption and assimilate the wastes arising from the human, and comparing with the ECC of a given area, through the <b>ecological</b> surplus and <b>deficit</b> (S&D) to measure the sustainable development. Water resource is the natural resource which has the economic value and social value. It has an irreplaceable position {{in the process of}} social production and can maintain the ecological environment (Lu 2010). However, Wackernagel shrinks the range of water for using in the calculation, ignoring the estimates of the ecological footprint of water resources. The concept of water resources EF (WEF) is produced {{on the basis of the}} concept of EF, referring to any known population (a person, a city or a region) which needs the land of water resources for consuming products and services during a certain period of time (Hoekstra et al. 2003).The WEF is used to describe the ecological environment and social economic function of water, in order to make up for the inadequate description of water resources function (Ayres R U 2000). The WEF is different from water footprint which is proposed by A.Y. Hoekstra in 2003. The water footprint is an indicator for measuring using water, which is the amount of water needed for any product or service consumed in any given area (region or population) over a period of time, including direct and indirect water used by consumer or producer. In recent years, the shortage of water resources affected the sustainable development of the world social and economic environment seriously (Aall et al. 2005). The EF of water resources has become a hot study (Van et al. 2000; Simmons C et al. 2000; Niccolucci V et al. 2012). The EF model has the clear conceptual framework, simple operation and facilitate comparison between different regions (Bastianoni, et al. 2012).The EF method tries to use specific observable indicators to define sustainability, establishing a comprehensive account to compare the human ecological demand and ECC, monitoring the natural resource depletion caused by human needs, and exploring the way of sustainable development (Wackernagel and Galli 2007). The method has been widely used in many countries and regions (Wu et al. 2006). Luck et al. 2001 calculate the EF of food and water in 20 metropolitan area of American according to the city channel model and the EF method of spatial heterogeneity; Jenerette (2006) used the spatial heterogeneity of the EF method to calculate the EF of 33 urban of the United States and China, and analyzed the influencing factors. Fan (2010) analyzed the EF in the north of Shanxi in 2010, and studied the sustainable development situation of the ecological environment; Fangling Sun studied the EF of water resources in Shandong province (Sun. 2011). Therefore, this paper argues that EF model of water resources combines the natural attribute, social attribute and spatial properties, which can be defined as the ability of sustainable development, and the largest water supply is available to support the regional resources, environment and social ecological, the production and life at a specific historical stage of development in an area.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} made {{an attempt to}} measure {{appropriation}} of ecosystems more reasonably and effectively based on examining {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of emergy analysis and ecological footprint. By combining emergy analysis with ecological footprint (EF) in terms of spatial equivalent of energy productivity, a new method of solar space (SS) and its calculating framework was proposed, and some necessary parameters for this method of analysis were calculated. A case study was followed under this calculating framework for Yangzhou city, Jiangsu province, Eastern China, using the data of the year 2000. The main results are as follows: (1) The ecological space in Yangzhou city includes earth surface space and solar space, and their demands were bigger than their supply. In the year of 2000, the earth surface space had an absolute deficit of 2. 3063 E- 02 Ga-ha per capita (global hectares), and the solar space had an absolute deficit of 1. 4944 E- 04 Sa-ha per capita (solar hectares). (2) There was a relative <b>ecological</b> <b>deficit</b> of 3. 68 % in earth surface space, and that of 154. 86 % in solar space. (3) Only freshwater areas and built-up areas were in a state of surplus, and there was a relative ecological surplus of 82. 66 % for freshwater areas, being greater than that for built-up areas. (4) The ranking of absolute <b>ecological</b> <b>deficit</b> in a descending order was as follows: solar space > arable land > pasture > forest > marine area > garden land, while the relative <b>ecological</b> <b>deficit</b> was the following: solar space > pasture land > forest land > arable land > garden land, except marine areas. A qualitative comparison of methodology was made between solar space method and ecological footprint according to their capability to describe the temporal-spatial characteristics of ecosystems appropriation. Moreover, a quantitative comparison was also conducted to show their differences in applicability to the assessment of ecosystems appropriation. It was shown that the calculating results from solar space method were bigger than that from ecological footprint because the former supplemented additional items of appropriation omitted by the later and included some new items of indirect appropriation that were excluded by the later. It is found that the new measure of solar space operates well as an indicator of the city&# 39;s appropriation to ecosystems. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Integrating spatial {{analysis}} with the {{supply and demand}} of biocapacity is critical for the sustainable development of regional eco-economic systems. Previous {{studies have focused on}} the temporal analysis of biocapacity at broad geographical scales, but lacked the systematic spatial realization at fine scales. An improvement is proposed of this conventional methodology of the ecological footprint by incorporating land-use data derived from high-resolution remote-sensing images into the calculation of biocapacity supply at regional, provincial and county levels in Northwestern China in 2000. The spatial heterogeneity and its effect on the biocapacity supply were systematically revealed for this region. First, the biocapacity supply declined from the east (the Guanzhong Basin and the Loess Plateau) to the middle (the Qaidam Basin and the Turpan Basin), and turned to rise from the middle to the west (the northwest of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomy). Second, although the gap between biocapacity supply and demand resulted in a small <b>ecological</b> <b>deficit</b> at the regional level, a large <b>ecological</b> <b>deficit</b> was observed at the provincial and county levels, highlighting an unsustainable situation for some of the sub-regions. Importantly, a power law relationship was unveiled between the biocapacity supply and population density, suggesting that (i) the biocapacity supply as a critical indicator could reflect the intensity of human exploitation on local biophysical resources and (ii) humans tend to have a preference to inhabit those areas with high biological productivity. These results provide opportunities to enhance policy development by central and local governments as part of the long-term Great Western Development Strategy of China.

40|$|Region is a {{complicated}} system, where human, nature and society interact and influence. Quantitative modeling and simulation of ecology {{in the region are}} the key to realize the strategy of regional sustainable development. Traditional machine learning methods have made some achievements in the modeling of regional ecosystems, {{but it is difficult to}} determine the learning characteristics and to realize spatio-temporal simulation. Deep learning does not need prior identification of training characteristics, have excellent feature learning ability, can improve the accuracy of model prediction, so the use of deep learning model has a significant advantage. Therefore, we use net primary productivity (NPP), atmospheric optical depth (AOD), moderate-resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), landcover and population data, and use LSTM to do spatio-temporal simulation. We conduct spatial analysis and driving force analysis. The conclusions are as follows: the <b>ecological</b> <b>deficit</b> of northwestern Henan and urban communities such as Zhengzhou is higher. The reason of former lies in the weak land productivity of the Loess Plateau, the irrational crop cultivation mode. The latter lies in the high consumption of resources in the large urban agglomeration; The positive trend of Henan ecological development from 2013 is mainly due to the effective environmental protection policy in the 12 th five-year plan; The main driver of the sustained <b>ecological</b> <b>deficit</b> growth of Henan in 2004 - 2013 is high-speed urbanization, increasing population and goods consumption.
