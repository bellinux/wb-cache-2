50|$|In the {{processing}} of signals in some applications of magnetic resonance imaging, <b>homodyne</b> detection can offer advantages over magnitude detection. The <b>homodyne</b> technique can suppress excessive noise and undesired quadrature components (90° out-of-phase), and provide stable access to information that may be encoded into the phase or polarity of images.|$|E

5000|$|Field amplitudes or quadratures {{with high}} {{efficiencies}} {{can be measured}} with photodetectors together with temporal mode selectivity. Balanced <b>homodyne</b> tomography is a reliable technique of reconstructing quantum states in the optical domain. This technique combines {{the advantages of the}} high efficiencies of photodiodes in measuring the intensity or photon number of light, together with measuring the quantum features of light by a clever set-up called the <b>homodyne</b> tomography detector. This is explained by the following example. A laser is directed onto a 50-50% beamsplitter, splitting the laserbeam into two beams. One is used as local oscillator (LO) and the other is used to generate photons with a particular quantum state. The generation of quantum states can be realized, e.g. by directing the laser beam through a frequency doubling crystal [...] and then onto a parametric down-conversion crystal. This crystal generates two photons in a certain quantum state. One of the photons is used as a trigger signal used to trigger (start) the readout event of the <b>homodyne</b> tomography detector. The other photon is directed into the <b>homodyne</b> tomography detector, in order to reconstruct its quantum state. Since the trigger and signal photons are entangled (this is explained by the Spontaneous parametric down-conversion article), it is important to realize, that the optical mode of the signal state is created nonlocal only when the trigger photon impinges the photodetector (of the trigger event readout module) and is actually measured. More simply said, it is only when the trigger photon is measured, that the signal photon can be measured by the <b>homodyne</b> detector.|$|E

50|$|Microwave {{detection}} {{is based}} on <b>homodyne</b> or heterodyne technologies. They can significantly increase the detection sensitivity by suppressing the noise and follow sub-nanosecond plasma generation and evolution. The <b>homodyne</b> detection method mixes the detected microwave electric field with its own source to produce a signal proportional to {{the product of the}} two. The signal frequency is converted down from tens of gigahertz to below one gigahertz so that the signal can be amplified and observed with standard electronics devices. Because of the high sensitivity associated with <b>homodyne</b> detection method, the lack of background noise in the microwave regime, and the capability of time gating of the detection electronics synchronous with the laser pulse, very high SNRs are possible even with milliwatt microwave sources. These high SNRs allow the temporal behavior of the microwave signal to be followed on a sub-nanosecond time scale. Thus the lifetime of electrons within the plasma can be recorded. By utilizing a microwave circulator, a single microwave horn transceiver has been built, which significantly simplify the experimental setup.|$|E

50|$|IQ {{imbalance}} is a performance-limiting {{issue in}} the design of direct conversion receivers, also known as zero intermediate frequency (IF) or <b>homodyne</b> receivers. Such a design translates the received radio frequency (RF, or passband) signal directly from the carrier frequency (fc) to baseband using only one mixing stage. The traditional heterodyne receiver structure needs an intermediate-frequency (IF) stage between the RF and baseband signals. The direct conversion receiver structure does not have an IF stage, and does not need an image rejection filter. Due to the lower component count, it is easier to integrate. However, a direct-conversion RF front-end suffers from two major drawbacks: one is IQ imbalance and the other is DC offset. When designing a <b>homodyne</b> receiver, control of IQ imbalance is necessary to limit signal demodulation error.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Homodyne</b> {{detection}} is {{a method}} of extracting information encoded as modulation of the phase and/or frequency of an oscillating signal, by comparing that signal with a standard oscillation that would be identical to the signal if it carried null information.

50|$|To {{obtain a}} large {{amplification}} coefficient with minimal noise, one may use <b>homodyne</b> detection, constructing a field state with known amplitude and phase, {{corresponding to the}} linear phase-invariant amplifier. The uncertainty principle sets the lower bound of quantum noise in an amplifier. In particular, the output of a laser system and the output of an optical generator are not coherent states.|$|E

5000|$|A direct-conversion {{receiver}} (DCR), {{also known}} as <b>homodyne,</b> synchrodyne, or zero-IF receiver, is a radio receiver design that demodulates the incoming radio signal using synchronous detection driven by a local oscillator whose frequency is identical to, or {{very close to the}} carrier frequency of the intended signal. This is in contrast to the standard superheterodyne receiver where this is accomplished only after an initial conversion to an intermediate frequency.|$|E

The <b>homodyne</b> tomography system functions as an amplifier.

This amplification is well above the photodetectors noise floor.|$|E

In these devices each pixel performs some local processing such as demodulation or gating at high speed, downconverting the signals to video rate so that the array may be read like a camera. Using this technique many thousands of pixels / channels may be acquired simultaneously. High resolution 3D lidar cameras use <b>homodyne</b> detection with an electronic CCD or CMOS shutter.|$|E
5000|$|One {{approach}} to implementing continuous-variable quantum information protocols {{in the laboratory}} is through the techniques of quantum optics. By modeling each mode of the electromagnetic field as a quantum harmonic oscillator with its associated creation and annihilation operators, one defines a canonically conjugate pair of variables for each mode, the so-called [...] "quadratures", which {{play the role of}} position and momentum observables. These observables establish a phase space on which Wigner quasiprobability distributions can be defined. Quantum measurements on such a system can be performed using <b>homodyne</b> and heterodyne detectors.|$|E
5000|$|Recovery of the {{modulating}} {{signal is}} usually by direct detection, not heterodyning. However, optical heterodyne detection {{is possible and}} has been actively studied since 1979. Bell Laboratories had a working, but impractical, system in 1969. Heterodyne and <b>homodyne</b> systems are of interest because {{they are expected to}} produce an increase in sensitivity of up to 20 dB allowing longer hops between islands for instance. Such systems also have the important advantage of very narrow channel spacing in optical frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. [...] OFDM is a step beyond wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM). Normal WDM using direct detection does not achieve anything like the close channel spacing of radio frequency FDM.|$|E

This has led to important results in quantum information sciences, for example quantum state merging. He is best known today {{for his work on}} quantum information with continuous variables. He found a Gaussian quantum cloning transformation [...] (see no-cloning theorem) and invented a Gaussian quantum key distribution protocol, which is the continuous counterpart of the so-called BB84 protocol, making a link with Shannon's theory of Gaussian channels. This has led to the first experimental demonstration of continuous-variable quantum key distribution with optical coherent states and <b>homodyne</b> detection.|$|E
50|$|In optical interferometry, <b>homodyne</b> signifies {{that the}} {{reference}} radiation (i.e. the local oscillator) {{is derived from}} the same source as the signal before the modulating process. For example, in a laser scattering measurement, the laser beam is split into two parts. One is the local oscillator and the other is sent to the system to be probed. The scattered light is then mixed with the local oscillator on the detector. This arrangement has the advantage of being insensitive to fluctuations in the frequency of the laser. Usually the scattered beam will be weak, in which case the (nearly) steady component of the detector output is a good measure of the instantaneous local oscillator intensity and therefore can be used to compensate for any fluctuations in the intensity of the laser.|$|E
5000|$|Light that {{is governed}} by sub-Poisson {{statistics}} cannot be described by classical electromagnetic theory and is defined by [...] The advent of ultrafast photodetectors {{has made it possible}} to measure the sub-Poissonian nature of light. An example of light exhibiting sub-Poissonian statistics is squeezed light. Recently researchers have shown that sub-Poissonian light can be induced in a quantum dot exhibiting resonance fluorescence. A technique used to measure the sub-Poissonian structure of light is a <b>homodyne</b> intensity correlation scheme. In this scheme a local oscillator and signal field are superimposed via a beam splitter. The superimposed light is then split by another beam splitter and each signal is recorded by individual photodetectors connected to correlator from which the intensity correlation can be measured. Evidence of the sub-Poissonian nature of light is shown by obtaining a negative intensity correlation as was shown in.|$|E
