40|$|The {{indirect}} victim's {{experience of}} suicide and the victimisation {{resulting from the}} incident was studied. The Indirect Victim's Experience Model of a Suicide Incident (see Figure 2. 1) {{was designed as a}} theoretical framework to direct the research findings and for the interpretation of data. A qualitative exploratory approach was used and a group of 20 respondents was selected by means of purposive and snowball sampling methods. All the respondents were interviewed personally. The interpretation and analysis of the data showed that the assumptions based on Janoff-Bulman and Frieze's theory and certain societal myths regarding suicide still exist. These assumptions and myths could subconsciously have an influence on {{the nature and extent of}} the victimisation experienced by the next of kin. The respondents themselves accepted these assumptions and myths. Research findings further showed that these assumptions are affected upon receiving the news of the suicide, while myths are destroyed. This could have an influence on the victim's experience of suicide. Every <b>indirect</b> <b>victim</b> functions before, during and after the suicide incident within a specific family and social system. The way in which the <b>indirect</b> <b>victim</b> experiences the support and integration from within the family and social system, determines the acceptance or non-acceptance of the death by suicide of a significant other. This will also have an influence on the indirect victim's reintegration into society in the short and long term. The need of the <b>indirect</b> <b>victim</b> to be involved within a family and society was clearly identified during the study. These findings made it possible to make practical recommendations with regard to the indirect victim's experience of suicide. Society should be informed about the realities and results of suicide. In addition, these findings highlighted further areas for research. Thesis (MA (Criminology)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2004. Social Work and Criminologyunrestricte...|$|E

40|$|Animal abuse {{represents}} a complex social, psychological, criminological, victimological and legal phenomenon whose gravity is increased {{if a child}} appears either as the perpetrator or as the observer of violence against animals. Etiology and phenomenology of animal abuse suggest that it tends to overlap with various deviant, delinquent and criminal activities, including physical, emotional and sexual abuse of family or other community members, alcohol and drug abuse, illegal gambling and betting and membership {{of children and adolescents}} in street gangs. The author discusses fundamental reasons, causes and motives for animal abuse committed by children as well as the devastating impact of children’s exposure to the scenes of animal abuse on their future delinquent behavior. She emphasizes the link between animal abuse and family violence and analyzes the position of a child as a direct or <b>indirect</b> <b>victim</b> in such situations.

After the war Soutine became a cult figure in London, as he did in contemporary Paris and New York. He embodied the idea of the ‘tragic’ artist in his still-life imagery of flayed animals, his uncompromising, heavily-laden paint surfaces, and in his identity as a Jew who had died in 1943, an <b>indirect</b> <b>victim</b> of the Nazi occupation of France. I try to identify which works in particular were known to the English artists, themselves all Jewish except for Bacon, and to describe the very different ways in which they reacted to Soutine's art and adapted its lessons to their own artistic purposes...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a {{critical analysis of}} the sentence of reparation in New Zealand, as set out by s 32 of the Sentencing Act 2002. The scope of the sentence is examined with particular regard to the recent Supreme Court decision, which limited reparation so that only victims of offences can benefit from the sentence. The definition of “victim”, {{as determined by the}} Sentencing Act, is confined to direct victims of criminal offending. Thus, any <b>indirect</b> <b>victim</b> suffering harm or loss from criminal offending cannot benefit from reparation. This paper questions whether that limitation gives reparation an appropriate scope, or whether some extension should be made so that the sentence is not restricted in its application to only benefit direct victims. In so doing, this paper argues that the criminal law is the suitable domain to address such issues of compensation and therefore, an extension of the reparation sentence is required. Alternative ways of limiting reparation to address this compensation issue are outlined. Ultimately it is proposed that an additional provision should be included within the definition of “victim”, for the purpose of s 32, so that indirect victims can also benefit from a sentence of reparation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Emergencies occur {{every day}} at {{unexpected}} times and impact our lives in unimaginable ways. In any emergency situation, there are two type of victims: direct <b>victims</b> and <b>indirect</b> <b>victims.</b> Both will have their current plans disrupted {{in order to deal}} with the emergency. Federal, State, and Local governments have established a 911 system to assist direct victims. However, there is still lack of assistance provided to the <b>indirect</b> <b>victims.</b> In this paper, we propose a Navigation Assistance Framework that allows emergency organizations to provide emergency information that can assist victims navigating out of the emergency area and reaching their intended destinations in a reasonable amount of time. We develop an emergency prototype ERSimMon to simulate this capability in a small scale to show the effectiveness of the proposed solution. In addition, we develop the Emergency Response Application (ERApp) for a smart phone platform, which intercepts the enhanced Commercial Mobile Alert System (CMAS) broadcast message, displays the user’s location with respect to the emergency location on the map and provides navigational assistance and recommend actions to help the user navigate out of ongoing emergencies.

40|$|Bullying is {{pervasive}} across {{schools in the}} United States. The bullying circle describes the roles of bully, bystanders, defender, and victim. Bully-victims, students who are both victims and bullies, are of special concern. Bullying consists of direct and indirect behaviors that are mean and hurtful. Many problems are associated with bullying and can be reduced with intervention. Two elementary school sites instituted the Olweus Bullying Prevention Program which intervenes at individual, classroom, school-wide, and community levels. Intervention consisted of an initial assessment, kickoff event, classroom meetings, feedback sessions, and subsequent assessment. The Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire {{was used to assess}} 496 participants pre-intervention and 483 participants post-intervention in grades 3 through 8. Participants in all grades received the kickoff event and classroom meetings. Participants {{were less likely to be}} a victim (RR = 0. 92), bully (0. 97), or bully-victim (0. 97) after program implementation. Victimization severity was lower after intervention (d = 0. 09). Risk ratios further showed that participants were less likely to join a bullying situation underway (0. 97) and more likely to defend a student being bullied (1. 15). There was minimal support for gender differences pre intervention, wherein girls were at more likely to have <b>indirect</b> <b>victim</b> roles (1. 10), while less likely to have direct victim roles (0. 93).

40|$|Child {{physical}} {{abuse and neglect}} is a topic that mainly media cases have drawn attention to in recent years. However, the media only show {{one aspect of the}} matter, the other one, often even more serious, remains hidden behind household walls. I consider child {{physical abuse}} and neglect still to be an up-to-date, serious and interesting subject, and that is why I have chosen this topic for my bachelor thesis. The theoretical part of the thesis focused on the family, children and their protection. It shows consequences on a child both as a direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>victim</b> of domestic violence. Furthermore, the thesis deals with methods of help to maltreated children and with basic legal documents providing for issues of maltreated children. The aim of this thesis is to inform about the issues and to show how the issues of maltreatment are viewed by children. A questionnaire survey among children of primary schools in České Budějovice aged 8 to 12 years was the research method. On the basis of the aims of the thesis, two hypotheses were laid out. The first one says that corporal punishments are the most frequent discipline that is nowadays used by parents to raise their children. According to the answers of the children, the hypothesis was not confirmed. The results implied that around 60 % of the children were mostly told off by their parents, and 40 % of the children were mostly punished by corporal punishments. The other hypothesis was that the media such as television and the internet are the main source of information for the children about the subject of physical abuse and neglect of children. This hypothesis was disproved by the research, too. According to the answers of the children, their parents and school participate most in their awareness. The media, relatives and other sources formed approximately 1 / 5. This thesis may be utilized as a source of information for students or persons interested in the subject of maltreated children. It may also serve as an inspiration for further research or education. Also, this thesis may be of interest to pedagogues working at primary schools as feedback and suggestion for other activities at the schools...|$|E
