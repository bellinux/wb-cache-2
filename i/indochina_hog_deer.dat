50|$|There are two {{separate}} but similar island <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> species: The Bawean deer (H. kuhlii) of Bawean Island in Indonesia, and the Calamian deer (H. calamianensis) of the Calamian Islands in the Philippines that inhabit moist or dry {{tropical deciduous forest}} environments. Unlike the best known western populations of the <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> (A. porcinus), their fawns are not spotted at birth. However, the eastern populations (perhaps equalling the subspecies A. p. annamiticus) of the <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> also have unspotted fawn. The two island <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> may be remnants of a widespread population of <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> {{that at one time}} were connected to the <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> populations of mainland Southeast Asia and inhabited vast areas of the Sunda Shelf during times of lower ocean levels.|$|R
50|$|The Bawean deer (Hyelaphus kuhlii), {{also known}} as Kuhl's <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> or Bawean <b>hog</b> <b>deer,</b> is a highly {{threatened}} species of deer found only in the island of Bawean (Gresik Regency) in Indonesia.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally {{there have}} been two {{classified}} subspecies of hog deer: Indian <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> (Hyelaphus porcinus porcinus) and the Indochinese <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> (Hyelaphus porcinus annamiticus). However recent morphological studies indicate they are better off as two separate species.|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to study population characteristics of <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> released into the wild, namely: density,age structure, sex ratio, recruitment rate, threats to <b>hog</b> <b>deer,</b> carrying capacity and inter-specific relationships, as well as toassess the population viability over time. In this study, direct observation was used to study the <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> population characteristics,and population density was estimated from the pellet-group count method. Vortex program was used to analyze thepopulation viability. Results showed that the population density of <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> at Thung Ka Mung (TKM) in Phu Khieo WildlifeSanctuary (PKWS) was 2. 03 - 2. 04 individuals/hectare (SD = 1. 25). The population structure showed that the average herd sizewas 9. 57 individuals. <b>Hog</b> <b>deer</b> in TKM preferred to stay with a group (91. 5 %), rather than being solitary (8. 5 %). The sex ratiofor males to females was 54. 64 : 100, and for females to fawns was 100 : 26. 18. The annual recruitment rate was 16. 98 %. Theirpredators were Asian wild dogs, Burmese pythons, Asiatic jackals, leopard cats and clouded leopards. The mortality rate ofthe existing <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> in TKM during the study period was 18. 1 %. The habitat sharing by camera traps revealed 4 ungulatespecies. They were sambar deer, barking deer, wild boar, and elephant, and their relative abundance were 28. 41 %, 7. 38 %, 4. 70 %, and 2. 01 % respectively. Fifty-year simulation modeling using population viability analysis indicated the sustainabilityof this population. <b>Hog</b> <b>deer</b> population in the simulations did not exhibit sensitivity to an increase or decrease in carryingcapacity. Habitat management should be carried out continuously in TKM area, which is the main habitat for <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> inPKWS...|$|R

50|$|<b>Hog</b> <b>deer</b> (Axis porcinus): <b>Hog</b> <b>deer</b> has a {{much wider}} {{distribution}} than chital and covers the area throughout the alluvial grassland of northern India, extending eastward to southern Nepal, Burma, Thailand, Indo-China, and Sri Lanka (Prater 1998). In Nepal, <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> are mainly concentrated in Chitwan, Karnali-Bardia and Sukla Phantas (Mishra 1982). Antlers consist of long bony pedicels with a short brow tine and a straight beam with a fork at the top (Prater 1998 and Mishra 1982). Fawning occurred from January to April in Chitwan (Dhungel and OGara 1991). Mishra and Wemmer (1987) found that the fawning season starts in February and increases until May. Tall grasses along the riverbanks, open phantas are favoured habitats. They are generally solitary but sometimes-small groups may graze together. During the hot {{hours of the day}} <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> shelter in tall grass and they feed {{early in the morning and}} in the evening (Dhungel and OGara 1991).|$|R
50|$|The animals {{includes}} the Chinkara, <b>hog</b> <b>deer,</b> common leopard, wolf, wild boar, jackal, porcupine and hare.|$|R

50|$|The antler of {{a mature}} <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> stag is {{typically}} three tined-brow tine with solid main beam terminating in {{inner and outer}} top tines. However, antlers with more points are not uncommon. The distinctive features of typical <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> antlers are the acute angle between the brow tine and main beam {{and the fact that}} the inner tops tend to be short and angle back from the main beam and across towards the opposite antler.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most notable}} {{representative}} of the fauna of the island is the endemic local subspecies of deer known as Bawean <b>deer,</b> Kuhl's <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> or Bawean <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> (Axis kuhlii). It is considered {{as a symbol of}} Bawean and is protected by Indonesian law. With less than 250 individuals, of which more than 90% belong to a single population, it is considered [...] "critically endangered" [...] and is included into the IUCN Red List.|$|R

40|$|The <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> (Axis porcinus) {{is a small}} deer whose {{natural habitat}} is the wet or moist tall grasslands in South and Southeast Asia. Wild populations have {{dramatically}} decreased in recent decades. While wild <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> were recently acknowledged to be extinct in China, a few captive populations have been maintained. In the present study, we successfully employed the restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) technique to generate a genome-wide profile of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the captive population of <b>hog</b> <b>deer</b> from Chengdu Zoo, China (N = 11). Up to 4. 7 million clean reads per sample were sequenced, and 11, 155 SNPs and 8, 247 haplotypes were simultaneously observed within more than 80 % of sequenced individuals. In this population, the mean frequency of major alleles at each polymorphism site was 0. 7903 ± 0. 0014, and the average nucleotide diversity (π) and inbreeding coefficient (FIS) were 0. 3031 ± 0. 0015 and - 0. 0302 ± 0. 0062, respectively. Additionally, the Euclidean distance-based multidimensional scaling method revealed that the pairwise genetic relatedness was evenly distributed. However, the results of homologous searching by short reads did not provide any meaningful explanation of the phylogenetic relationship of <b>hog</b> <b>deer,</b> which should be further investigated. In conclusion, our results revealed current state of genetic diversity in this captive population of <b>hog</b> <b>deer.</b> Furthermore, these genome-wide SNPs would be useful for guiding the mating schedule to avoid sharp increase of inbreeding coefficient...|$|R

25|$|Compared to the <b>hog</b> <b>deer,</b> the chital {{has a more}} cursorial build. The antlers and brow tines {{are longer}} {{than those in the}} <b>hog</b> <b>deer.</b> The pedicles (the bony cores from which antlers arise) are shorter and the {{auditory}} bullae are smaller in the chital. The chital may be confused with the fallow deer. The chital is darker and has several white spots, whereas the fallow deer has white splotches. The chital has a prominent white patch on its throat, while the throat of the fallow deer is completely white. The hairs are smooth and flexible.|$|R
