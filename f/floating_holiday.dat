[...] In September 2003, the university added a new demand to the table: increasing work hours for MUNACA members without additional compensation. In response, MUNACA members authorized pressure tactics, including a protest, and suspended talks until the demand was rescinded. Concern about overwork of MUNACA members was raised by faculty and MUNASA members at the McGill Senate. [...] McGill later withdrew the demand for increased working hours and the parties entered conciliation at McGill's request. [...] In December 2003, MUNACA members overwhelmingly rejected McGill's offer and authorized a strike. They also participated in a voluntary half-day walkout and demonstration. Partly at issue were <b>floating</b> <b>holidays</b> and summer Fridays.

25|$|Overall, in 2007, 33% of {{employers}} gave employees the day off, a 2% {{increase over the}} previous year. There was little difference in observance by large and small employers: 33% for firms with over 1,000 employees; and, 32% for firms with under 1,000 employees. The observance is most popular among nonprofit organizations and least popular among factories and manufacturers. The reasons for this have varied, ranging from the recent addition of the holiday, to its occurrence {{just two weeks after}} the week between Christmas and New Year's Day, when many businesses are closed for part or sometimes all of the week. Additionally, many schools and places of higher education are closed for classes; others remain open but may hold seminars or celebrations of King's message. Some factories and manufacturers used MLK Day as a <b>floating</b> or movable <b>holiday.</b>|$|R
