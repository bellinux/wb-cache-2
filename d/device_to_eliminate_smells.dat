Aerostatic {{bearings}} are {{utilized in}} a variety of precision <b>devices</b> <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> viscous friction between moving parts for realizing high accurate motion and supporting load at zero speed. However, in practice external pressurized source is necessary to realize the aerostatic bearing, which sometimes leads to difficulty in some medical and aero applications within tightly sealed containers. In order to tackle this problem, an innovative principle bearing, which utilizes traveling waves, has been proposed in previous paper. In order to theoretical analyze the principle and numerical predict the performance of the gas bearing utilizing traveling waves, a numerical model based on 2 -dimenssional Navier-stocks Equations with neglecting gravitational force is developed in this paper. The equations are solved discretely by dynamically meshing the isotropic 2 D model and updating the boundary conditions. It reveals that the gas film force varies with a nonzero average value that can be utilized to realize a non-contact gas bearing. The effect of driving voltage and frequency, and the bearing clearance height on the average film force is clarified by simulations. The proposed bearing design is ought <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> drawbacks of conventional hydrostatic bearings such as supply of external pressure source, use of compressor, and tubes while still achieving comparable static and dynamic capabilities...|$|R

Its basic function is to inject the voltage difference (difference between the pre-sag and sag voltage) to the power line and maintains the pre-sag voltage condition in the load side. Different control strategies are available depending on the compensation technique used for compensation. A new control strategy for the single-phase voltage sags based on in-phase compensation technique is described in this paper. In the designed control, the DVR initially tracks the phase angle of the supply voltage and produce a reference voltage signal with the rated load voltage magnitude. If any phase jump occurred at the supply voltage, phase angle of the reference voltage signal is adjusted slowly to track the phase angle of the supply voltage. The difference between the reference and measured voltage is injected by the DVR. Therefore with this DVR control technique, the load will not experience any phase jump or dip. The simulation was carried out using EMTDC/PSCAD software and the results show a very good level of compensation for different voltage sags...|$|R

The prerequisite for economical earthquake-resistant bridges is the structures’ capacity to absorb and dissipate a large amount of seismic energy. A widely considered strategy for enhancing this capacity is through the use of passive energy dissipation systems for seismic protection of structures. It has been known that majority of the available energy dissipation systems are non-usable after a major earthquake, which increases the risk of collapse during an aftershock. The focus of the current study is given to introduce a new type of passive energy dissipation device with a pending patent that is testified to have an improved energy dissipation capacity without suffering any damage while absorbing energy. Thus, the proposed damper does not require an immediate expensive replacement and keeps its operational capabilities and effectiveness during aftershocks.

At present, the harmonic suppression techniques mainly contain the passive power filter (PPF) [5], active power filter (APF) [6, 7], and hybrid active power filter (HAPF) [8]. As mentioned in [9], HAPF can be classified as single-resonance injection hybrid active power filter (S-IHAPF), double-resonance injection hybrid active power filter (D-IHAPF), and multi-branch injection hybrid active power filter (M-IHAPF). The HAPF combines the advantages of both PPF and APF, effectively reducing the rated capacity and voltage of the active part without making a compromise of satisfactory performance in the integral filter system. It has been {{an effective way to}} suppress harmonic currents and compensate reactive power in high voltage distribution network. The reactive power compensator is capable of suppressing the voltage fluctuation and flicker. Off-the-shelf var compensators in distribution network include fixed capacitor (FC) [1, 2], static var compensator (SVC) [10], and static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) [11], etc. Among these devices, the STATCOM is widely used for its multiple functions, such as grid voltage fluctuation suppression, and unbalanced load compensation.
