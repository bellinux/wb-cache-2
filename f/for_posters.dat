5|$|Blaine {{gives in}} to Kurt's urgings and wishes and {{transfers}} to McKinley High {{so they can}} spend more time together during Kurt's senior year. Kurt and Rachel decide they want to apply to a top school for the dramatic arts in New York City, NYADA, but are intimidated when they meet some of their competition and decide their applications need to include more accomplishments: Rachel proposes that McKinley do West Side Story as the school musical so she can star in it, and Kurt runs for class president. Brittany volunteers to be his campaign manager, and he accepts, but when he objects to her suggestions <b>for</b> <b>posters</b> and paraphernalia as overemphasizing his sexuality, she decides {{to run for the}} office herself. Kurt tries out for the musical, but the directors aren't convinced that he's masculine enough to portray Tony, the romantic male lead, and cast Blaine instead, even though he's only a junior; Kurt is given the minor role of Officer Krupke. When Rachel believes that she might not be cast as Maria, the female lead, she panics and decides to run for class president as well, infuriating Kurt. She eventually withdraws and throws her support behind Kurt, and secretly decides to help him further by stuffing the ballot box in his favor. He nevertheless loses to Brittany, and Rachel is suspended from school for cheating. The same day that Kurt loses, his father wins a special congressional election against Sue.|$|E
25|$|Because of the clear, bold {{nature of}} the large serifs, slab serif designs are often used <b>for</b> <b>posters</b> and in small print. Many monospace fonts, on which all {{characters}} occupy {{the same amount of}} horizontal space as in a typewriter, are slab-serif designs. While not always purely slab-serif designs, many fonts intended for newspaper use have large slab-like serifs for clearer reading on poor-quality paper. Many early slab-serif types, being intended <b>for</b> <b>posters,</b> only come in bold styles with the key differentiation being width, and often have no lower-case letters at all.|$|E
25|$|Slab serif typefaces date {{to about}} 1800. Originally {{intended}} as attention-grabbing designs <b>for</b> <b>posters,</b> {{they have very}} thick serifs, {{which tend to be}} as thick as the vertical lines themselves.|$|E

25|$|Namatjira died in 1959, {{and by then}} {{a second}} {{initiative}} had also begun. At Ernabella, now Pukatja, South Australia, the use of bright acrylic paints to produce designs <b>for</b> <b>posters</b> and postcards was introduced. This led later to fabric design and batik work, which is still produced at Australia's oldest Indigenous art centre.|$|E
25|$|Akzidenz-Grotesk {{was popular}} {{in this period}} {{although}} other typefaces such as Monotype Grotesque were used also: a problem with use of Akzidenz-Grotesk up to the late 1950s {{was that it was}} only available in foundry type for handsetting. While this was acceptable <b>for</b> <b>posters,</b> by the 1950s hot metal typesetting machines had become the main system for printing general-purpose body text, and for this system Akzidenz-Grotesk was unavailable until around 1958-9, when it was first sold on Linotype and then in 1960 on Intertype systems. Much printing around this time of body text accordingly used Monotype Grotesque as a lookalike.|$|E
25|$|Display type {{refers to}} the use of type at large sizes, perhaps 30 points or larger. Some typefaces are {{considered}} useful solely at display sizes, and are known as display faces. Most effect typefaces are display types. Common features of display type include tighter default letter spacing, finer details and serifs, slightly more condensed letter shapes and larger differences between thick and thin strokes; many of these are most visible in serif designs. Many display typefaces in the past such as those intended <b>for</b> <b>posters</b> and newspaper headlines were also only cut in capitals, since it was assumed lower-case would not be needed, or at least with no italics. This was true of many early sans-serif fonts.|$|E

25|$|Data {{released}} by the Constitutional Courts indicated that the PS was the party with the largest budget, with almost 996,000 Euros in its war-chest, followed by the PSD, with 651,000 Euros, while the PPM was the group with the smallest budget, with only 3,000 Euros. It was anticipated that the PS would spend 261,000 Euros in its campaign; followed by the CDU, with 65,000 Euros; and the CDS-PP, with 61,000 Euros, while the PPM little more than 1,450 Euros. The Platforma de Cidadania (the alliance between the PPM and PND), with a global budget of 48,000 Euros, dedicated {{the majority of their}} cash reserves to public relation firms and market studies (where they spent 26,000 Euros). For the PSD, which received 350,633 Euros of state subsidies, the highest expenditure item, 180,000 Euros, was devoted to purchase giveaways and other offers. For its part the PDA, the only national party with their headquarters in the Azores, expected to spend 8,000 Euros, with 5,000 Euros <b>for</b> <b>posters</b> and pamphlets in order to elect their first parliamentary seat.|$|E

This made it a popular choice <b>for</b> <b>posters.</b> Gill's biographer Malcolm Yorke has described it as [...] "the essence of clarity for public notices".|$|E
