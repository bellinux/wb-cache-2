25|$|It is {{estimated}} that Iriomote cats live for seven to {{eight years in the}} wild, and eight to nine years in captivity. Human influences, traffic accidents and traps may lower their lifespan to two to five years. In captivity, an <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cat</b> lived for an estimated 15 years and one month, the longest known lifespan of any <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cat.</b>|$|E
25|$|When eating {{birds that}} {{are larger than}} a dusky thrush, most types of cats will pluck the {{feathers}} and then eat it, but the <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cat</b> will eat even large birds whole without removing the feathers. Also, unlike other cats, the <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cat</b> does not kill its prey immediately by breaking the spinal cord. Instead, it holds the animal in its mouth until it stops moving.|$|E
25|$|<b>Iriomote</b> <b>cat</b> P. b. iriomotensis (Imaizumi, 1967) — found {{exclusively}} {{on the island of}} Iriomote, one of the Ryukyu Islands in the Japanese Archipelago; Following its initial description in 1967, the <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cat</b> was often recognised as a distinct species, but following mtDNA analysis in the 1990s was considered a subspecies of the leopard cat. The latest revision places it within the subspecies Prionailurus bengalensis euptilura of the mainland leopard cat.|$|E
40|$|An {{epidemiological}} survey of <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cats</b> (Prionailurus bengalensis iriomotensis) {{was conducted to}} understand the prevalence and molecular characteristics of hemotropic mycoplasma (hemoplasma). A series of ecological surveys of <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cats</b> were performed between November 2003 and September 2010. During this period, 31 <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cats</b> were captured or found, and 39 blood samples were collected. Polymerase chain reaction screening for hemoplasmas and BLAST searches revealed that 4 of the 31 cats were positive for hemoplasma infection (n= 3, Mycoplasma haemofelis [Mhf]; n= 1, ‘Candidatus M. turicensis’ [CMt]). The 4 infected cats were captured or found in the northern area of the island of Iriomote. Phylogenetic analyses revealed close relationships between Mhf and CMt isolated from <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cats</b> compared with those from domestic cats and other wild felids. In our study, we identified two species of hemoplasma in <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cats.</b> The number and location of the hemoplasma-positive cats appeared to be limited; however, continuous surveillance of hemoplasma infection in <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cats</b> is necessary...|$|R
25|$|The skull {{is longer}} and more narrow {{than that of a}} {{domestic}} cat. When compared to the leopard <b>cat's</b> skull, the <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cat's</b> is roughly the same size but thicker. Because of this, the <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cat's</b> brain is smaller; a male leopard cat's brain is about 42 grams, whereas a male <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cat's</b> brain is about 30 grams. The occipital bone of the skull and the auditory capsule are not connected. The mandibular symphysis is short.|$|R

25|$|Destruction {{of habitat}} due to development, {{predation}} by dogs, traffic accidents, and traps set for wild boar and crabs {{all contribute to}} the decline in number of <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cats.</b> During the second survey of the island, conducted from 1982–1984, {{it was estimated that}} 83–108 <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cats</b> lived on the island. The third survey, conducted from 1993–1994, estimated that 99–110 of the cats were on the island. During the fourth survey, conducted from 2005–2007, there were an estimated 100–109 remaining cats. The method of estimating the numbers differed between the third and fourth surveys, though; if the third estimate were to be revised, there would have been an estimated 108–118 <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cats</b> at the time, meaning that the population is shrinking over time.|$|R
25|$|The tips of {{the ears}} are rounded, with black hair along the edge. There are no tufts of longer hair {{on the top of}} the ears. Adult <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cats</b> have a white spot on the back of each ear, much like those found on tigers' ears. Young <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cats</b> do not have these marks, and even as adults the spots will not be as white as those seen on other leopard cat subspecies.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cat's</b> {{eyes are}} a light amber color. Its nose {{is large and}} flat, with no fur {{covering}} the reddish-brown skin. The paw ranges from [...] wide, {{in contrast to the}} [...] wide paw of a domestic cat.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cat</b> has six {{pairs of}} incisors, {{two pairs of}} canine teeth, four pairs of premolars, and two pairs of molars {{for a total of}} 28 teeth. Compared to other cats, {{including}} small wild cats, the <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cat</b> is lacking one pair of premolars on the top jaw behind the canines. In addition to this, unlike most other subtropical mammals, Iriomote cats' teeth give details about their year-to-year history. It is expected that these details will help determine the age and behavior of the cats.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to researching the <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cat,</b> Togawa also looked into {{rumors of a}} larger cat on the island (see Yamapikaryaa) and conducted an investigation. Before returning to Tokyo, he offered $100 for any live <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cat</b> and $30 for dead cats that were brought to him. With {{the aid of the}} Taketomi mayor and the , he was able to publicize the offer on bulletin boards and in other ways. He also announced rewards for the rumored large cat on the island: $200 if brought in alive, $100 for remains.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cat</b> was {{discovered}} in 1965 by , an author who specialized in works about animals. In 1967, it was first described by Yoshinori Imaizumi, director of the zoological department of the National Museum of Nature and Science in Tokyo.|$|E
25|$|In June 1999, the Iriomote Wildlife Protection Center {{conducted}} an investigation among 50 house and feral <b>cats</b> and 23 <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cats</b> {{in order to}} see if FIV was being transmitted within the populations. FIV was not seen in any of the <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cats,</b> but three of the house and feral cats tested positive. Because of the fears regarding transmission of the disease, starting in 2001 Taketomi Town enacted the Cat Breeding Ordinance which required all residents to register their pet cats. In June 2008, the ordinance was revised to include mandatory FIV testing and vaccinations, spaying and neutering, and microchipping. A new limit to the number of pets allowed per owner was also added.|$|R
25|$|Upon {{arriving}} on the island, Togawa learned {{that because there}} wasn't enough food on Iriomote, people would cook <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cats</b> that had been caught and use the meat in soup. Cats caught in traps would also be disposed of, which made acquiring samples difficult.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cat's</b> {{eyes are}} a light amber color. Its nose {{is large and}} flat, with no fur {{covering}} the reddish-brown skin. The paw ranges from 29 - 37 mm wide, {{in contrast to the}} 24 - 30 mm wide paw of a domestic cat.|$|R
25|$|Yon was {{the first}} <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cat</b> to be kept for an {{extended}} period of time, the only to be saved after an accident, and the first to go through rehabilitation. Other Iriomote cats that were rescued either died immediately or shortly after being brought in for care.|$|E
25|$|The Iriomote cat's karyotype, the {{restriction}} fragment {{length of the}} ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and molecular phylogenetic analyses of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA and cytochrome b {{have proven to be}} identical, or nearly so, to the leopard cat's. The two cats are assumed to be extremely closely related, their differences being categorized as either intraspecies variations or individual mutations. Also, from the speed of cytochrome b's base-pair substitution and its diversity, it is estimated that the <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cat</b> diverged from the leopard cat around 180,000-200,000 years ago. According to marine geologists, the Ryukyu Islands were connected to mainland Asia via a land bridge from about 20,000 years ago to 240,000 years ago. Scientists believe that the <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cat</b> moved its range to the islands during this period. Because of this, it is assumed that there is little genetic variety within the species.|$|E
25|$|The primary fear {{stems from}} house cats {{that have become}} feral or {{partially}} feral, {{but there has been}} no monitoring of these interactions. Pressure from competition over food, contact with house cats that have contracted feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and other contagious diseases, as well as decrease in population due to hybridization are all important issues with the <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cat.</b>|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} traffic accidents, logging due to {{development}}, {{and development of}} the swamplands, house pets are also causing problems. House cats and stray cats especially cause issues with competition, disease transmission, and genetic pollution due to hybrids born of inter-species breeding. It is also feared that dogs prey on the <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cats.</b>|$|R
25|$|Young male <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cats</b> {{and some}} adult cats are transient, i. e. {{wandering}} {{over the island}} and waiting for an open home range slot that they can occupy by marking this area. Female cats allow their young {{to stay in their}} own home range and mark a new territory once the next breeding season comes.|$|R

25|$|The <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cat</b> (Prionailurus bengalensis iriomotensis) is a {{subspecies}} of {{the leopard}} cat that lives {{exclusively on the}} Japanese island of Iriomote. It has been listed as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List since 2008, as the only population comprises fewer than 250 adult individuals and is considered declining. As of 2007, there were an estimated 100–109 individuals remaining.|$|E
25|$|Since the US {{returned}} {{control of}} the Ryukyu Islands to Japan in 1972, development on Iriomote continued with finances from the Okinawan mainland. In 1977, a prefectural road was built that circles half of the island, {{which has led to}} a few <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cat</b> deaths every year due to traffic accidents. The Ministry of the Environment as well as the governments of Okinawa and Taketomi Town began installing road signs to warn people of Iriomote cats, tunnels beneath the road for animals' safe crossing, zebra zones which create loud noises when cars ride over them, wide ditches on the sides of roads, and ditches {{on the side of the}} road that are inclined on one side in order to improve the preservation of the cats. However, many residents have objected to restrictions on land cultivation and improvement brought about by the measures in place to protect the <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cat</b> and other species on the island.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{accident}} he couldn't move on his own, but he regained {{his ability to}} walk while on Ishigaki. He was {{brought back to the}} Iriomote Wildlife Preservation Center for rehabilitation on August 31. Originally labeled W-48 {{due to the fact that}} he was the forty-eighth confirmed sighting of an <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cat</b> on the western part of the island, he eventually was given the name Yon.|$|E
25|$|Since the <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cat's</b> discovery, various {{investigations}} have taken place. In 2006, automatic cameras and radio telemetry {{were used in}} order to understand the cats' state of life. Pathological tests regarding the contagiousness of diseases were also conducted, and tests on feces and food leftovers were also done. They also compiled records of cat sightings by locals and tourists.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Iriomote</b> <b>cats</b> are terrestrial, but climb trees, go {{into the}} water and also swim. They are nocturnal and {{especially}} active during twilight hours.

25|$|Through these offers, he {{acquired}} two complete skeletons, two skulls, and three pelts {{that he brought}} back with him to Tokyo. One of the pelts was that which the elementary school children helped obtain, and it was confirmed {{to be that of}} an <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cat.</b> The sample from Yubu Island was small, and judgment was held back. A sample from Ishigaki Island was discovered to be a house cat.|$|E
25|$|In January 1966, {{the body}} of an <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cat</b> that had been caught in a wild boar trap in the mid-basin of the Nakama River was sent to Koura at the University of the Ryukyus, {{but there was no}} more {{information}} regarding captures for some time after this. In December 1966, , a hunter at the Nakama River's mid-basin, caught a live male cat, but it escaped immediately. He then caught another male cat soon after.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to Dr. Imaizumi's assertions about its unique characteristics, {{other researchers have}} strongly disputed {{the idea that the}} <b>Iriomote</b> <b>cat</b> is its own species ever since its discovery. Investigations involving skulls and teeth, samples and living animals, and genetic research were conducted to determine whether it is its own species or a subspecies of leopard cat. Because of these studies, it has been subordinated under the genus Prionailurus as Prionailurus iriomotensis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Iriomote</b> <b>cats</b> are territorial. Home {{ranges of}} males and females overlap, and one to two females live within a male's home range.
