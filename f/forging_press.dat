25|$|Multidirectional Forging {{is forming}} {{of a work}} piece in a single step in several directions. The multidirectional forming takes place through {{constructive}} measures of the tool. The vertical movement of the press ram is redirected using wedges which distributes and redirects {{the force of the}} <b>forging</b> <b>press</b> in horizontal directions.|$|E
25|$|A <b>forging</b> <b>press,</b> {{often just}} called a press, {{is used for}} press forging. There are two main types: {{mechanical}} and hydraulic presses. Mechanical presses function by using cams, cranks and/or toggles to produce a preset (a predetermined force at a certain location in the stroke) and reproducible stroke. Due {{to the nature of}} this type of system, different forces are available at different stroke positions. Mechanical presses are faster than their hydraulic counterparts (up to 50 strokes per minute). Their capacities range from 3 to 160 MN (300 to 18,000 short tons-force). Hydraulic presses use fluid pressure and a piston to generate force. The advantages of a hydraulic press over a mechanical press are its flexibility and greater capacity. The disadvantages include a slower, larger, and costlier machine to operate.|$|E

Accordingly, both manufacturers and users of <b>forging</b> <b>presses</b> need for practical guidelines, tools and reliable data to evaluate the elastic behaviour of presses {{and its effects on}} product geometrical accuracy. This paper deals with an innovative approach to model the elastic and dynamic behaviour of the overall system comprising workpiece, tooling and press and to evaluate its working accuracy. The paper focuses {{on the development of the}} two loading devices that together with the measurement of relative displacements between upper and lower beds of the press permit to evaluate the dynamic stiffness of <b>forging</b> <b>presses</b> in realistic operating conditions...|$|R
