40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} possibilities of using monthly production records for genetic evaluation of laying hens with four different models and different data sets. The {{data were collected from}} a pure line of Lohmann Tierzucht GmbH at Cuxhaven in Germany for two generations from 1998 to 1999 with pedigree being traced back one generation. In total of 9735 hens from 220 sires and 1879 dams were analysed. The evaluated models were: (1) Cumulative Model (CM), (2) Multiple Trait Model (MTM), (3) Fixed Regression Model (FRM), and Random Regression Model (RRM). Variance components were estimated using Animal Model with REML and breeding values were predicted using BLUP Animal Model. The RRM is an interesting model for the evaluation. The RRM agrees with the laying curve over the whole evaluated period from the first to eleventh month production. Selection for an increased total production based on the <b>first</b> <b>six</b> <b>month</b> production with the RRM may not be useful. The integration of full year performance from the parent in a selection on the <b>first</b> <b>six</b> <b>month</b> production with the RRM improved the shape of the curve and increased the correlation with the full performance considerably. In addition, genetic evaluation of total production based on odd month production is sufficient for an efficiency of recording system...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—As battery {{capacities}} {{are a key}} {{limiting factor}} of wireless sensor networks, harvesting energy from the environ-ment is very attractive. For outdoor applications, solar power {{seems to be the}} best suited energy source. However, the amount of energy delivered from the sun changes significantly over the year, which makes the dimensioning of the panel difficult. In this paper we discuss the most important impact factors and introduce a model that predicts the harvested solar power and the battery charge over the year. In addition, we present experimental results of the <b>first</b> <b>six</b> <b>month</b> of our long term experiments for validating our model. I...|$|R

40|$|Late (more than <b>six</b> <b>months)</b> total {{occlusion}} after coronary stenting is {{a progressive}} phenomenon occurring in approximately 4 % of patients, leading to {{acute myocardial infarction}} in less than 0. 5 %. The process must be related to severe and progressive intimal hyperplasia. In patients receiving coronary stenting with simultaneous brachytherapy, late total occlusion has been reported {{at a higher rate}} and to be related to stent thrombosis rather than intimal hyperplasia. Late total occlusion presenting with an acute clinical event seven months after the implantation of a paclitaxel drug eluting stent is reported. The occlusion developed soon after the interruption of ticlopidine treatment, suggesting that the event had a thrombotic genesis and that the risk is not confined to the <b>first</b> <b>six</b> <b>month</b> period.    Keywords: paclitaxel eluting stent; late thrombosi...|$|R

They regarded Charles III of Naples as Louis the Great's legitimate heir because Charles was the last male offspring of the Capetian House of Anjou.
