25|$|The bluestripe snapper is {{commonly}} taken throughout its range by handlines, traps, and gill nets. It is usually marketed fresh, and {{is common in}} the markets of many countries. It {{is one of the}} principal species in the Hawaiian <b>handline</b> fishery, but as noted above, it fetches low prices at market.|$|E
50|$|<b>Handlining</b> is {{also used}} for {{catching}} fresh water fish. Panfish, walleyes, and other freshwater game fish can be caught using <b>handlining</b> fishing techniques. <b>Handlining</b> can be practiced from the shore or from a fishing boat. Walleye anglers practice <b>handlining</b> over moderately deep water in a drifting boat. <b>Handlining</b> is also practiced by ice fishing anglers.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Handlining</b> - is {{fishing with}} a single fishing line, baited with lures or bait fish, which is held in the hands. <b>Handlining</b> can be done from boats or from the shore. It is used mainly to catch {{groundfish}} and squid, but smaller pelagic fish can also be caught.|$|R
25|$|The tuna {{are caught}} by the {{following}} methods: pole and line, <b>handline</b> and longline. The pole and line method is most commonly used, and results in 90 percent (2002) of the total fish catch. This traditional use of the pole and line method in the Maldivian tuna industry {{has contributed to the}} sustainability of the tuna resources. With recent further improvements in fishing gear and methods, it appears that the catch levels may be close to the maximum sustainable yield.|$|E
25|$|The main {{commercial}} King George whiting {{fishery is}} centred on South Australia from Ceduna {{in the west}} to Gulf St Vincent in the east. Smaller fisheries are present in Victoria and south west Western Australia. Common catching practices include haul seine nets, gill nets as well as longline and <b>handline</b> methods. This fishery {{is one of the most}} important in the country, reportedly worth five million Australian dollars a year, as King George whiting fetch premium price in markets. This single species alone was reported as comprising 60% of the total annual catch in South Australia during the late 1980s. The fish are sold either whole or as fillets and are generally rated as one of the very best quality Australian fish for the table.|$|E
25|$|The initial attack {{focused on}} {{extinguishing}} {{the fire in}} the loading dock area, with a secondary effort to search for and evacuate people inside, and prevent the fire from spreading to the showroom and warehouse. Crews entering the showroom reportedly initially encountered clear visibility with only very light puffs of smoke visible near the ceiling {{at the back of the}} showroom. Shortly thereafter, an exterior door was opened near where the fire was raging. Efforts to close the door failed, allowing the fire to enter the showroom. Firefighters were ordered to stretch two hose lines into the showroom to attack the spreading fire; however, the pre-connected hose line from one of the units was too short. This required some firefighters to again exit the building to add additional sections of hose, and left only one small <b>handline</b> to hold back the growing fire. At about this time, fire dispatchers advised the crews on-scene that they had received a 9-1-1 call from an employee who was trapped in the warehouse, which required some firefighters to direct their attention to the rescue. The trapped employee was eventually rescued by firefighters who breached an exterior wall to reach him.|$|E

Before Banks dories were introduced, fish were caught with <b>handlines</b> from the mother ship alone.

2500|$|Cross Seamount is {{well known}} in fishery and {{scientific}} communities for its small but abundant biologic community. Longline fishing ships occasionally fished at Cross Seamount for many years prior to the development of <b>handline</b> fishing, in 1976.

2500|$|The Malabar trevally, Carangoides malabaricus, (also {{known as}} the Malabar jack, Malabar {{kingfish}} and nakedshield kingfish) is a species of large [...] marine fish of the jack family, Carangidae. It is distributed throughout the Indian and west Pacific Oceans from South Africa {{in the west to}} Japan and Australia in the east, inhabiting reefs and sandy bays on the continental shelf. The Malabar trevally is similar to many of the other species in the genus Carangoides, with the number of gill rakers and the grey-brown colour of the tongue being the diagnostic features. The Malabar trevally is a predator, taking a variety of small fish, cephalopods and crustaceans. The species is of minor economic importance throughout its range, caught by a variety of net and <b>handline</b> methods.|$|E

50|$|Contemporary {{cast nets}} have a radius which ranges from 4 to 12 feet (1.2 to 3.6 metres). Only strong people can lift the larger nets {{once they are}} filled with fish. Standard nets for {{recreational}} fishing have a four-foot hoop. Weights are usually distributed around the edge at about one pound per foot (1.5 kilograms per metre). Attached to the net is a <b>handline,</b> one end of which is held in the hand as the net is thrown. When the net is full, a retrieval clamp, which works like a wringer on a mop, closes the net around the fish. The net is then retrieved by pulling on this <b>handline.</b> The net is lifted into a bucket and the clamp is released, dumping the caught fish into the bucket.|$|E
