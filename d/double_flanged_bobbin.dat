50|$|The Guided Light Transit {{designed}} by Bombardier Transportation {{which has been}} adopted in Nancy and Caen. Here a <b>double</b> <b>flanged</b> wheel between the rubber tyres follows the guidance rail.|$|R
50|$|The wheel {{arrangement}} of the locomotives were 0-3-0. The middle flange less wheel was of 50 cm diameter. Other two wheels were <b>double</b> <b>flanged</b> having groove depth of 2.15 cm. The locomotive had wheelbase of 119 cm.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} and carriages had rectangular steel frames, {{in which}} a <b>double</b> <b>flanged</b> steel wheel ran at either end. To balance the vehicle, it had spring-suspended steel rollers with 8 inch (20 cm) height and 8 inch (20 cm) diameter. The couplings between the carriages were re-used from scrapped Los Angeles trams.|$|R
50|$|Four {{locomotives}} {{were built}} with this wheel arrangement in 1907 for the Patiala State Monorail Trainways, a monorail line in Patiala, India. They had <b>double</b> <b>flanged</b> driving wheels and the locomotives had an outrigger wheel that {{ran on the}} ground. The builder was Orenstein & Koppel of Berlin, one locomotive is preserved in working order at the Indian National Railway Museum, New Delhi.|$|R
5000|$|The {{gauge of}} the tramroads was 3ft 4in, {{and it was}} {{constructed}} of edge rails of a plain cross-section 2 inches wide at the head and [...] inches wide at the base, and three inches deep. The wagon wheels were <b>double</b> <b>flanged,</b> straddling the rail. Cast iron sleepers maintained the gauge, and these were supported on square wooden blocks laid on stone chippings. There were no passing places on the single line tramroads: empty wagons were manhandled off the track to allow loaded wagons to pass them.|$|R
40|$|With the {{development}} of the space shuttle launching facilities, it became mandatory to develop a shuttle rotating service structure to provide for the insertion and/or removal of payloads at the launch pads. The rotating service structure is a welded tubular steel space frame 189 feet high, 65 feet wide, and weighing 2100 tons. At the pivot column the structure is supported on a 30 inch diameter hemispherical bearing. At the opposite terminus the structure is supported on two truck assemblies each having eight 36 inch diameter <b>double</b> <b>flanged</b> wheels. The following features of the rotating service structure are discussed: (1) thermal expansion and contraction; (2) hurricane tie downs; (3) payload changeout room; (4) payload ground handling mechanism; (5) payload and orbiter access platforms; and (6) orbiter cargo bay access...|$|R
50|$|W.J. Ewing {{implemented}} a monorail system, {{with only one}} rail and <b>double</b> <b>flanged</b> rail wheels, that had been proposed by William Thorold in a lecture to the British Association in 1868. This system avoided all those problems, since it was laid out {{along the side of}} a road, it took up very little land. Further, the road or balance wheel's main purpose was to balance the train and to keep it upright. The balancing wheel on the road carried only 4% or 5% of the load, it did not subtract much from the steel wheel-steel rail efficiency. As the track was on side of the road, it was no obstacle to vehicles crossing it. Further, since it was a monorail with a supporting wheel on the ground, the issue of curve resistance did not arise in Ewing System, since the wheels were placed on a single track only.|$|R
50|$|The early {{cast iron}} rails of the 18th century and before used {{integral}} fixings for nailing or bolting to the railroad ties. Strap rails {{introduced in the}} late 18th century, of cast and later rolled iron were nailed to wooden supports via countersunk holes in the metal. The introduction of rolled rail profiles in the 1820s such as the single flanged T parallel rail and later <b>double</b> <b>flanged</b> T parallel rail required the use of chairs, keys to hold the rail, and bolts or spikes to fix the chair. The flat bottomed rail invented by Robert L. Stevens in 1830 was initially spiked directly to wooden sleepers, later tie plates were used to spread the load and also keep the rail in gauge with inbuilt shoulders in the plate. Outside North America {{a wide variety of}} spring based fastening systems were later introduced in combination with baseplates and flat bottomed rail, these are now ubiquitous on main line high speed railways.|$|R
50|$|The tramway {{was built}} using old track {{materials}} from the Ffestiniog Railway. The track gauge was , as the wagons ran onto the Ffestiniog, although the track gauge above the mill was only nominally the same, as internal wagons had <b>double</b> <b>flanged</b> wheels which were loose on the axles. Operation of the Lake Incline was {{the responsibility of the}} Conglog Quarry, although after 21 years, ownership would transfer to the Cwmothin Quarry, who would make a payment for the drum and the rails. This appears to have happened, although it is not documented, as the three inclines on the Cwmorthin main line were all listed in a sale document from 1900. Cwmorthin Quarry was bought by Oakeley Quarry, after which they were connected underground, allowing it to be worked from the Oakeley side, and the absence of Oakeley men to operate the inclines was eventually resolved when Cadwaladr Roberts was given permission to operate them.|$|R
5000|$|PSMT {{initially}} used mules to {{pull the}} train. Later four steam locomotives were acquired for pulling the coaches. It is not known whether the locomotives were used on both lines or only on Patiala Sunam line. These four locomotives were of 0-3-0 configuration and was built by Orenstein & Koppel (O&K) of Berlin in 1907 at cost of £500 to £600 each. Donald W. Dickens, in his article on the PSMT, described the locomotives as “These were an adaptation of the normal O&K 0-6-0's but had a <b>double</b> <b>flanged</b> driver in the centre of each axle rather than drivers at each end. The right-hand water tank was larger so {{that some of the}} weight shifted onto the 39 in diameter balance wheel which was attached beyond the enlarged water tank. The outside cylinders were 5½" [...] × 14".The designer at O&K took advantage of the extra cab space behind the enlarged right-hand water tank and put the fire door {{on the right side of}} the fire box rather than at the back as is usually done. These locos were confined to the Patiala - Sunam line.” ...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT: Pancreatic stents may {{be placed}} during {{therapeutic}} ERCP {{for a variety}} of indications. One such indication is to prophylax against the development of pancreatitis following sphincterotomy of the minor papilla in patients with recurrent acute pancreatitis and pancreas divisum. Increasingly, endoscopists that perform pancreatic ERCP are placing small caliber (3 Fr), unflanged, single pigtail stents into the long axis of the pancreatic duct with the expectation that these stents will only stay in place for a few days and the majority will pass spontaneously on their own without the need for follow-up endoscopic retrieval. As such, these stents are generally regarded as safer and associated with a lower rare of complication than larger (5 and 7 Fr), <b>double</b> <b>flanged</b> pancreatic stents. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 3 Fr stent that migrated proximally into the dorsal duct in a patient with recurrent pancreatitis and pancreas divisum. Due to the small size of the patient's dorsal duct, it was difficult to pass appliances alongside the stent to facilitate retrieval and a variety of appliances were used before success was achieved. DISCUSSION: The medical literature contains series of proximally migrated larger caliber flanged, pancreatic stents but proximal migration of small caliber, unflanged, pigtail stents has not yet been reported. As the use of these small stents increases, we feel {{that it is important to}} highlight the potential for this complication and discuss how we successfully treated our patient...|$|R
40|$|Multi-material {{structures}} pose {{an attractive}} option for overcoming {{some of the}} central challenges in lightweight design. An exceptionally high potential for creating cost-effective lightweight solutions is attributed to the combination of steel and aluminum. However, these materials are also particularly difficult to join due to their tendency to form intermetallic compounds (IMCs). The growth of these compounds is facilitated by high temperatures and long process times. Due to their high brittleness, IMCs can severely weaken a joint. Thus, it is only possible to create durable steel-aluminum joints when the formation of IMCs can be limited to a non-critical level. To meet this goal, a new joining method has been designed. The method {{is based on the}} combination of a continuous wave (pw) and a pulsed laser (pw) source. Laser beams from both sources are superimposed in a common process zone. This makes it possible to apply the advantages of laser brazing to mixed-metal joints without requiring the use of chemical fluxes. The double beam technology was first tested in bead-on-plate experiments using different filler wire materials. Based on the results of these tests, a process for joining steel and aluminum in a double-flanged configuration is now being developed. The <b>double</b> <b>flanged</b> seams are joined using zinc- or aluminum-based filler wires. Microsections of selected seams show {{that it is possible to}} achieve good base material wetting while limiting the growth of IMCs to acceptable measures. In addition, the results of tensile tests show that high joint strengths can be achieved...|$|R
