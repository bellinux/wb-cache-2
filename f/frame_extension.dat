25|$|The Martin family prospered and grew. By 1770, {{based on}} the use of exposed beams that were not reduced in dimension, it was {{necessary}} to expand the house, something that had not been done to the other German-built houses in the region. The expansion plan followed the Dutch practice of extending the existing structure in one of its lateral directions rather than building a new section, story or wing, other than building the <b>frame</b> <b>extension</b> on the front, with its middle three bays open, creating a recessed porch. Other local cultural influences were present as well—the new section's fireplaces were in English styles.|$|E
2500|$|In 1970, the Policia Militar do Rio de Janeiro (PMRJ) {{asked the}} {{services}} of Jener Damau Arroyo, a Spanish-born gunsmith, to make modifications on their PASAMs {{in order to improve}} their handling. The first modification (PASAM MOD-1), of which 101 were modified, received a metal <b>frame</b> <b>extension</b> welded to the magazine housing. It was fitted with a metal forward grip well ahead of the gun under the muzzle. The original grip was left alone, making it compatible with the wooden holster/stock. The second modification (PASAM MOD-2), involving 89 pistols, featured a similar <b>frame</b> <b>extension,</b> but the forward grip had wooden panels and was of different shape. The pistol grip frame used thicker rectangular wooden grips and had a [...] "t-bar" [...] metal shoulder stock welded to it. A metal frame attached to the receiver supported a rectangular wooden foregrip, taking pressure off the barrel. In both models, of course, the barrel was left free so as to enable it to do its short recoil during firing. For the record, 295 PASAMs were left in the original condition. It took standard detachable 10-round box magazines, although they can also take the extended 20- and 40-round magazines.|$|E

5000|$|The {{building}} now {{identified as}} the Girl's Dormitory was originally completed in 1878. The NRHP application indicates that it has had more extensive repair and renovation than any other building in the District. It was the original building of the boarding school, designed to house {{both boys and girls}} and to provide both classroom and office space. This original structure was constructed of stone and covered a footprint measuring 31 feet m by [...] A kitchen extension was added in the same year. A two story <b>frame</b> <b>extension</b> was added to the front, projecting from the west end of the original facade. By 1890, a 20 foot m by 50 foot m, two-story <b>frame</b> <b>extension</b> was added which projected {{to the front of the}} west end of the original facade. This work included adding a veranda that wrapped around the front and east sides of the building. By 1909, then superintendent, George W. Nellis, decided to replace the <b>frame</b> <b>extension</b> with one of stone. The replacement was completed in 1912.|$|E
50|$|The John B. Harper House is a {{historic}} house located at 102 N. Lincoln St. in Palestine, Illinois, United States. The home was built circa 1833 {{and is one of}} the few remaining buildings from the early settlement of Palestine. The wood frame and brick house features a hall and parlor plan; <b>frame</b> <b>extensions</b> were later added to the back of the home. It was the home of John B. Harper, a blacksmith and farmer who also served as a Crawford County judge.|$|R
50|$|The {{house was}} built {{sometime}} before 1754 by Joseph Damon, and a portion was inherited by his son Jabez. The house was to remain in divided ownership {{by members of the}} Damon family for more than 100 years, the various shares being finally united in 1870 by Rufus Damon. This method of dividing and sharing houses was not particularly unusual in rural settings where buildings were expensive to build. The saltbox form, while typical in New England, was unusual in Reading, where <b>framed</b> <b>extensions</b> are more often found in houses of this period.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Since Mathematics {{really is}} about what mathematicians do, in this paper, {{we will look at}} the {{mathematical}} practice of framing, in which an object of interest is viewed in terms of well-understood math-ematical structures. The new perspective not only allows to deepen the understanding of a resp. object, it also facilitates new insights. We pro-pose a model for framing in the context of theory graphs, and show how framing can be exploited to enhance the interaction with MKM systems. We use the <b>framing</b> <b>extension</b> of our SACHS system — a semantic help system for MS Excel — as a concrete example. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} a 40 m 2 timber <b>framed</b> <b>extension</b> to an {{existing}} timber house, on a small lot in an inner city suburb. The project {{was the result of}} non-traditional collaboration between client, building and architect. The collaboration took the form of explorations in the documentation of timber framed domestic construction, such that aspects of the project might be designed and constructed by any of the three participating parties. Documentation was deliberately vague and un-finalised, in order for all parties to participate in the design resolution of the project as it progresed. Construction was completed in 2004...|$|R

50|$|In Germany {{and other}} parts of Europe, rolling {{exterior}} shutters on tracks have become ubiquitous, although they lack the decorative value of traditional shutters. When open, these type shutters roll up into boxes concealed in the thickness of the wall above the window. They are typically raised and lowered manually, such as by a rolling pull made of flat nylon cord, but they can be equipped with electric operating mechanisms. These shutters allow some light in the room when not fully lowered, but wholly block light when completely closed. Variations include <b>frame</b> <b>extensions</b> that allow the closed shutter to swing out like an awning or Bermuda shutter.|$|R
5000|$|The Owings Upper Mill (also {{known as}} A.E. Groff's Flour Mill) is a {{historic}} grist mill located at Owings Mills, Baltimore County, Maryland, United States. It is a large -story brick structure, 50 by 60 ft. The building stands on a low stone foundation, surmounted by a molded brick water table. Two <b>frame</b> <b>extensions</b> were built sometime in the 1880s. The words [...] "EUREKA FLOUR MILL" [...] are worked into the façade in purple brick between the second- and third-story windows. The building is probably the oldest and largest mill surviving in Baltimore County and was the last known project of Samuel Owings, the American Revolutionary War patriot and enterprising merchant.|$|R
25|$|An entirely fresh {{approach}} was also taken by AMC engineers with the Pacer's front suspension and engine mounting. It {{was the first}} U.S. small car to isolate the engine and suspension system noises from the passenger compartment. The entire front suspension was mounted on a crossmember isolated from the <b>frame</b> <b>extensions</b> by heavy rubber bushings. It is also different from all other AMC cars with the coil spring between the two control arms, seated on the lower wishbone arm {{at the bottom and}} in the suspension/engine mount crossmember at the top. The rear suspension was also isolated, requiring a special tool to press the one-piece bushings {{in and out of the}} mounting brackets.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{reliability}} of estimating three-dimensional (3 D) linear kinematics and kinetics of a swimmer derived from digitized video and to assess the effect of framing rate and smoothing window size. A stroke cycle of two high-level front crawl swimmers and one high level backstroke swimmer was recorded by four underwater and two above water video cameras. One of the front crawl swimmers was recorded and digitized at 50 Hz with a window for smoothing by 4 th order Butterworth digital filter extending 10 frames beyond the start and finish of the stroke cycle, while the other front crawl and backstroke swimmer were recorded and digitized at 25 Hz with the window extending five frames beyond the start and finish of the stroke cycle. Each camera view of the stroke cycle was digitized five times yielding five independent 3 D data sets from which whole body centre of mass (CM) component velocities and accelerations were derived together with wrist and ankle linear velocities. Coefficients of reliability ranging from r = 0. 942 to r = 0. 999 indicated that both methods are sufficiently reliable to identify real differences in net force production during the pulls of the right and left hands. Reliability of digitizing was better for front crawl when digitizing at 50 Hz with 10 <b>frames</b> <b>extension</b> than at 25 Hz with 5 <b>frames</b> <b>extension</b> (p < 0. 01) and better for backstroke than front crawl (p < 0. 01). However, despite the extension and reflection of data, errors were larger in the first 15 % of the stroke cycle than the period between 15 and 85 % of the stroke cycle for CM velocity and acceleration and for foot speed (p < 0. 01) ...|$|R
