When filming the sequel, Bay was told by soldiers the film helped their children understand what their work was like, and that many had christened their Buffalos – the vehicle used for Bonecrusher – after various Transformer characters.|$|E
5|$|Payton's legacy {{continues}} through the charitable Walter and Connie Payton Foundation. His own appeals—and after his death, his foundation's—for <b>greater</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> {{the need for}} organ donations are widely credited with bringing national attention to the problem. After his appeals, donations in Illinois skyrocketed, and the regional organ bank of Illinois was overwhelmed with calls. In response, the City of Chicago inserted organ donation requests into city-vehicle-registration mailings in early 2000, and by August 2000, 13,000 people had {{signed on to the}} program. The foundation continues to run a program that Payton organized to donate toys to underprivileged children across the Chicago area each Christmas. The family established the Walter Payton Cancer Fund in 2002.|$|E

5|$|The Old National Library Building was a {{historical}} building at Stamford Road in the Museum Planning Area of Singapore. Originally completed in 1960, it housed the National Library {{and was a}} national icon for many Singaporeans. Despite a huge groundswell of public dissent, the library was closed on 31 March 2004, and was demolished {{to make way for}} the construction of the Fort Canning Tunnel to ease road traffic to the city. The controversy surrounding the building's demise has been credited for sparking <b>greater</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> local cultural roots and an unprecedented wave in favour of heritage conservation among Singaporeans.|$|E
5|$|Under Antemoro Zafikasimambo leadership, the commoners' {{freedom was}} {{significantly}} reduced and religion became a central feature {{of social and}} political life. The conflict between the Antemoro and Zafiraminia nobles and the resulting Zafikasimambo rule also established a tradition of emigration from this part of the island. Unlike the majority of Malagasy who generally seek to return to their ancestral land, the Antemoro initially felt no such call to remain linked to a geographic area. As a result, the ombiasy of the Antemoro traveled widely, some moving from place to place and others settling permanently at royal courts and elsewhere. Their arcane knowledge of writing, medicine, technology and other areas both established their reputation as indispensable advisers to nobles and commoners alike, and instilled the island-wide feature of the community astrologer who shapes daily life. The ombiasy of Matitana were According to historian Bethwell Ogot, the network of stationary and itinerant Antemoro ombiasy were key in transforming the societies of Madagascar from an amalgam of insular clans to outward looking communities with <b>greater</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> others, leading to territorial expansion and larger, more complex kingdoms. In addition, oral histories suggest that sovereigns among the Merina, Tanala and Antanosy may have had ancestors who migrated away from Antemoro country.|$|E
25|$|Less known {{than its}} {{civilian}} equivalent or its cryptologic counterpart, DIA and its personnel have at times been portrayed in works of American popular culture. As with other U.S. foreign intelligence organizations, the agency's role has occasionally been confused {{with those of}} law enforcement agencies. DIA's parent organization, the Department of Defense, features in fiction and media much more prominently due to the public's <b>greater</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> its existence and the general association of military organizations with warfare, rather than spycraft.|$|E

25|$|The organ has an {{integral}} place in liturgical {{music in the}} Church of the Risen Christ, and is the sole instrument that accompanies the congregation and choirs during the mass. The organ is also used together with other encouraged forms of liturgical music like choral polyphony and plainchant. It is hoped that this total experience of liturgical music will lead the faithful to a <b>greater</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> the divine in the liturgical celebrations, and help the faithful to truly sing the mass, and not just sing at mass.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{self-concept}} {{is known}} as the ability of a person to have opinions and beliefs that are defined confidently, consistent and stable. Early in adolescence, cognitive developments result in greater self-awareness, <b>greater</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> others and their thoughts and judgments, the ability to think about abstract, future possibilities, and the ability to consider multiple possibilities at once. As a result, adolescents experience a significant shift from the simple, concrete, and global self-descriptions typical of young children; as children, they defined themselves by physical traits whereas as adolescents, they define themselves based on their values, thoughts, and opinions.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, {{the treaty}} gained {{prominence}} amid <b>greater</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> Māori issues and grievances, {{particularly with regard}} to land claims. Māori have looked to the Treaty for rights and remedies for land loss and unequal treatment by the state, with mixed success. From the late 1960s, Māori began drawing attention to breaches of the Treaty, and subsequent histories have emphasised problems with its translation. In 1975, the Waitangi Tribunal was established as a permanent commission of inquiry tasked with researching breaches of the Treaty by the British Crown or its agents, and suggesting means of redress.|$|E

25|$|To {{compensate}} for the increased risk of stroke, anticoagulants may be required. However, {{in the case of}} warfarin, if someone with AF has a yearly risk of stroke that is less than 2%, then the risks associated with taking warfarin outweigh the risk of getting a stroke from AF. However, since these older data, there is now greater recognition of the importance of good anticoagulation control (as reflected by time in therapeutic range) as well as <b>greater</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> bleeding risk factors as well as data from recent trials that aspirin carries a similar rate of major bleeding to warfarin, especially in the elderly.|$|E
25|$|Body psychotherapy, part of {{the field}} of somatic psychology, focuses on the link between the mind and the body and tries to access deeper levels of the psyche through <b>greater</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> the {{physical}} body and emotions. There are various body-oriented approaches, such as Reichian (Wilhelm Reich) character-analytic vegetotherapy and orgonomy; neo-Reichian bioenergetic analysis; somatic experiencing; integrative body psychotherapy; Ron Kurtz's Hakomi psychotherapy; sensorimotor psychotherapy; Biosynthesis psychotherapy; and Biodynamic psychotherapy. These approaches are {{not to be confused with}} body work or body-therapies that seek to improve primarily physical health through direct work (touch and manipulation) on the body, rather than through directly psychological methods.|$|E
25|$|Various psychoactive {{substances}} (both {{legal and}} illegal) have {{been implicated in}} causing, exacerbating, or precipitating psychotic states or disorders in users, with varying levels of evidence.

Individuals who have a substance induced psychosis {{tend to have a}} <b>greater</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> their psychosis and tend to have higher levels of suicidal thinking compared to individuals who have a primary psychotic illness. Drugs commonly alleged to induce psychotic symptoms include alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, cathinones, psychedelic drugs (such as LSD and psilocybin), κ-opioid receptor agonists (such as enadoline and salvinorin A) and NMDA receptor antagonists (such as phencyclidine and ketamine).|$|E

25|$|In 1993, James F. Masterson {{proposed}} {{two categories}} for pathological narcissism, exhibitionist and closet. Both fail to adequately develop an age- and phase- appropriate self because of defects {{in the quality}} of psychological nurturing provided, usually by the mother. The exhibitionist narcissist is the one described in DSM-IV and differs from the closet narcissist in several important ways. The closet narcissist {{is more likely to be}} described as having a deflated, inadequate self-perception and <b>greater</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> emptiness within. The exhibitionist narcissist would be described as having an inflated, grandiose self-perception with little or no conscious awareness of the emptiness within. Such a person would assume that this condition was normal and that others were just like him. The closet narcissist seeks constant approval from others and appears similar to the borderline in the need to please others. The exhibitionist narcissist seeks perfect admiration all the time from others.|$|E

30|$|These results {{indicate}} that school children were drawing what they know of their local forest, and not depicting values relating to forests in general. The results also show an <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> not only what is occurring in their local forest, but {{the importance of the}} forested environment to the local region. For example, Tapawera children displayed <b>greatest</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> forest ecosystem services (fresh air and clean water). From the literature, we know that for children the level of experience of a forested area is linked to <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> ecosystem processes and the production of more detailed drawings in workshop investigations (Strommen 1995), hence the Tapawera children’s awareness may reflect a greater level of exposure to their local forest.|$|R

Francesca Happé has described Miedzanik’s writing as the [...] "least autistic" [...] from the authors that he was compared to including Temple Grandin, as he demonstrated the <b>greatest</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> his limitations and how others perceived him.

500|$|Foreign journalists {{had been}} {{deported}} from East Pakistan {{shortly before the}} Pakistani army's Operation Searchlight, and even after Mascarenhas' first-hand observations had been published, Shankar and Harrison were concerned that the mainstream media in the West were showing a reluctance to report all the facts.

500|$|By {{the early}} modern era Gaelic had been in {{geographical}} decline for three centuries and had begun to be a second class language, confined to the Highlands and Islands. It was gradually being replaced by Middle Scots. From the mid sixteenth century, written Scots was increasingly influenced by the developing Standard English of Southern England, which came to dominate elite discourse. After the Union in 1707 the use of Gaelic and Scots were discouraged by many in authority and education, as was the notion of Scottishness itself. The extent and borders of the kingdom had been fixed in their modern form {{by the beginning of}} the sixteenth century, with the exception of the debatable lands, settled by a French led commission in 1552. The accession of James VI to the English throne made the borders less significant in military terms, becoming, in his phrase the [...] "middle shires" [...] of Great Britain, but it remained a jurisdictional and tariff boundary until the Act of Union in 1707. Edinburgh had emerged as the capital in the fifteenth century and continued to be a major administrative centre. From the seventeenth century the responsibilities of shires expanded from judicial functions into wider local administration. The parish also became an important unit of local government. By the mid-seventeenth century this system had largely been rolled out across the Lowlands, but was limited in the Highlands. There was much <b>greater</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> geography and political boundaries in this period and Scotland was extensively mapped for the first time.|$|E

[...] The Philippine National Police has a special police force assigned at LRT-1 and LRT-2 [...] and security police provided by private companies are assigned to all stations with each having a designated head guard. [...] Closed-circuit televisions have been installed to monitor stations and keep track of suspicious activities.

[...] It is standard practice for bags to be inspected upon entry into stations by guards equipped with hand-held metal detectors. [...] Those who refuse to submit to such inspection may be denied entry. [...] Since May 1, 2007, the LRTA has enforced a policy against making false bomb threats, a policy already enforced at airports nationwide. [...] Those who make such threats can face penalties in violation of Presidential Decree No.1727, as well as face legal action.

30|$|Our {{findings}} {{suggest that there is}} a marked imbalance between the <b>great</b> <b>awareness</b> about climate change impacts and the adaptation measures put into practice on the ground. In order to tackle climate change challenges, it is important to provide capacities and support to the forest sector. The research presented in this paper provides evidence that despite the many uncertainties associated with climate change, forest stakeholders in Belgium show <b>great</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>of</b> the need to adjust forest management practices to meet the needs for adaptation to climate change. However, this finding contrasts with the perceived lack of knowledge on how to adapt. Improving communication of adaptation challenges and strategies for climate change adaptation is therefore likely to be the most effective approach for increasing action, which should also be the focus of future research.|$|R
