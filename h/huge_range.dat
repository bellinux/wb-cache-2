5|$|The {{black mamba}} is rated as least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of Endangered species, {{based on its}} <b>huge</b> <b>range</b> across sub-Saharan Africa and no {{documented}} decline.|$|E
5|$|The great spotted {{woodpecker}} {{is closely}} related to some other members of its genus. It has a number of subspecies, some of which are distinctive enough to be potential new species. It has a <b>huge</b> <b>range</b> and large population, with no widespread threats, so it is classed as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|Although {{numbers have}} {{declined}} steeply in western Europe, this bird is classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List {{because of its}} <b>huge</b> <b>range</b> and large, apparently stable, populations in Russia and Kazakhstan. Numbers in western China are more significant than previously thought, and conservation measures have facilitated an increased population in some countries which had suffered the greatest losses. Despite its elusive nature, the loud call has ensured the corn crake has been noted in literature, and garnered a range of local and dialect names.|$|E

This has {{lead to the}} development of many techniques for decomposing series and fields into fluctuations Δν at well-defined scales. Classically, one defines fluctuations as differences: (Δν) diff = ν(x +Δx) -ν(x) and this is adequate for many applications (Δx is the "lag"). However, if over a range one has scaling Δν ∝ Δx H, these difference fluctuations are only adequate when...|$|R
5|$|The fulvous {{whistling}} duck feeds in wetlands by day {{or night}} on seeds {{and other parts of}} plants. It is sometimes regarded as a pest of rice cultivation, and is also shot for food in parts of its range. Despite hunting, poisoning by pesticides and natural predation by mammals, birds and reptiles, the large numbers and <b>huge</b> <b>range</b> of this duck mean that it is classified as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|The {{garden warbler}} is hunted by Eurasian sparrowhawks and {{domestic}} cats, and its eggs and nestlings are {{taken by a}} variety of mammalian and avian predators. It may be host to various fleas, mites and internal parasites, and it is a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. The large and fairly stable numbers and <b>huge</b> <b>range</b> of the garden warbler mean that it is classed as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Despite a small population decline in much of its European range, the bird's breeding distribution is expanding northwards in Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} pintail is a bird of open wetlands which nests on the ground, often {{some distance from}} water. It feeds by dabbling for plant food and adds small invertebrates to its diet during the nesting season. It is highly gregarious when not breeding, forming large mixed flocks with other species of duck. This duck's population is affected by predators, parasites and avian diseases. Human activities, such as agriculture, hunting and fishing, have also {{had a significant impact}} on numbers. Nevertheless, owed to the <b>huge</b> <b>range</b> and large population of this species, it is not threatened globally.|$|E
25|$|The {{traction}} trebuchet was a siege engine {{which uses}} {{the power of}} men pulling on ropes or the energy stored in a raised weight to rotate what was, again, a staff sling. It was designed so that, when the throwing arm of the trebuchet had swung forward sufficiently, {{one end of the}} sling would automatically become detached and release the projectile. Some trebuchets were small and operated by a very small crew; however, unlike the onager, it was possible to build the trebuchet on a gigantic scale: such giants could hurl enormous rocks at <b>huge</b> <b>ranges.</b> Trebuchets are, in essence, mechanised slings.|$|R
40|$|International audienceNowadays, {{there are}} <b>huge</b> <b>ranges</b> of energy market participants. Commercial {{success of this}} area actor depends {{on the ability to}} submit {{competitive}} predictions relative to energy balance trends Thus, it seems convenient to "anticipate" this parameter evolution in time in order to act consequently and resort to protective actions. In this context, this paper proposes a tool for energy balance prediction based on ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System). This neuro- fuzzy predictor is modified in order to obtain an accurate forecasting for medium term. The solutions are illustrated on a real application and take into account the known "future”: the programmed actions...|$|R

5|$|W5 {{is found}} in Thoroughbreds {{descending}} from Puchilingui, a 1984 stallion with sabino-like white spotting and roaning. Horses with the W5 allele exhibit a <b>huge</b> <b>range</b> in white phenotype: a few have been pure white or near-white, while others have sabino-like spotting limited to high, irregular stockings and blazes that covered the face. Twenty-two members of this family were studied, and the 12 {{with some degree of}} dominant white spotting were found to have a deletion in exon 15 (p.T732QfsX9), {{in the form of a}} frameshift mutation. A later study found that the members of this family with the greatest depigmentation were compound heterozygotes who also carried the W20 allele.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the view that}} science rests on foundational assumptions, coherentism asserts that statements are justified by being a part of a coherent system. Or, rather, individual statements cannot be validated on their own: only coherent systems can be justified. A prediction of a transit of Venus is justified by its being coherent with broader beliefs about celestial mechanics and earlier observations. As explained above, observation is a cognitive act. That is, it relies on a pre-existing understanding, a systematic set of beliefs. An observation of a transit of Venus requires a <b>huge</b> <b>range</b> of auxiliary beliefs, such as those that describe the optics of telescopes, the mechanics of the telescope mount, and an understanding of celestial mechanics. If the prediction fails and a transit is not observed, that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system, a change in some auxiliary assumption, rather than a rejection of the theoretical system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Geophysical {{processes}} are typically variable over <b>huge</b> <b>ranges</b> of space-time scales. This has {{lead to the}} de-velopment of many techniques for decomposing series and fields into fluctuations 1 v at well-defined scales. Clas-sically, one defines fluctuations as differences: (1 v) diff = v(x+ 1 x) −v(x) and this is adequate for many applications (1 x is the “lag”). However, if over a range one has scal-ing 1 v ∝ 1 xH, these difference fluctuations are only ade-quate when 0 <H < 1. Hence, there {{is the need for}} other types of fluctuations. In particular, atmospheric processes in the “macroweather ” range ≈ 10 days to 10 – 30 yr generally have − 1 <H < 0, so that a definition valid over the range − 1 <H < 1 would be very useful for atmospheric applica-tions. A general framework for defining fluctuations is wavelets...|$|R
