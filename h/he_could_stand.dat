5|$|After the 1976 tour, Townshend took {{most of the}} {{following}} year off {{to spend time with}} his family. He discovered that former Beatles and Rolling Stones manager Allen Klein had bought a stake in his publishing company. A settlement was reached, but Townshend was upset and disillusioned that Klein had attempted to take ownership of his songs. Townshend went to the Speakeasy where he met the Sex Pistols' Steve Jones and Paul Cook, fans of the Who. After leaving, he passed out in a doorway, where a policeman said he would not be arrested if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stand</b> and walk. The events inspired the title track of the next album, Who Are You.|$|E
5|$|The ICTY charged Milošević {{with the}} {{extermination}} of non-Serb civilians in Erdut, the forcible transfer {{of at least}} 2,500 inhabitants of the village and destruction of their property. Milošević's trial commenced on 12 February 2002, but he died in March 2006 before a verdict could be reached. The SDG, which became the most powerful paramilitary formation in eastern Slavonia, and Ražnatović gained notoriety for war crimes and ethnic cleansing. The SDG systematically plundered villages in the region, turning the area into a source of oak lumber, crude oil and wine for Ražnatović to sell in Serbia, and in Erdut itself. Ražnatović was never charged for any war crimes committed by the SDG in Erdut. The ICTY only charged him with several war crimes committed in or near Sanski Most. He was assassinated in Belgrade on 15 January 2000 before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stand</b> trial.|$|E

25|$|Von Brunn {{was charged}} {{in federal court}} on June 11, 2009, with first-degree murder and {{firearms}} violations. On July 29, 2009, von Brunn was indicted by {{a federal grand jury}} on seven counts, including four which made him eligible for the death penalty; the charges included hate crime counts. In September 2009, a judge ordered von Brunn to undergo a competency evaluation {{to determine whether or not}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stand</b> trial. On January 6, 2010, von Brunn died of natural causes while awaiting trial.|$|E
25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Great War, he was given command of the Home Defence Army, part of Ian Hamilton's Home Defence Central Force. However, following the sudden death of Sir James Grierson, he was placed in charge of the British Expeditionary Force II Corps, by Lord Kitchener, the new Secretary of State for War. Field Marshal Sir John French had wanted Sir Herbert Plumer but Kitchener chose Smith-Dorrien as he knew <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stand</b> up to French, and in the full knowledge that French disliked him. Kitchener admitted to Smith-Dorrien that he had doubts about appointing him, but put them to one side.|$|E
25|$|John F. Kennedy, the 35th President of the United States, {{was assassinated}} on Friday, November 22, 1963 at 12:30p.m. in Dallas, Texas while {{riding in a}} presidential {{motorcade}} in Dealey Plaza. Kennedy was riding with his wife Jacqueline, Texas Governor John Connally, and Connally's wife, Nellie, and was fatally shot by former U.S. Marine Lee Harvey Oswald. A ten-month investigation by the Warren Commission from November 1963 to September 1964 concluded that Oswald acted alone in shooting Kennedy, and that Jack Ruby also acted alone when he killed Oswald before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stand</b> trial. Kennedy's death marked the fourth (following that of Lincoln, Garfield, and McKinley) and most recent assassination of an American President. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson automatically became President upon Kennedy's death.|$|E

25|$|There was {{speculation}} in mid-2014 that Rajapaksa {{would call}} another early presidential election: on 20 October 2014 Minister of Mass Media and Information Keheliya Rambukwella {{confirmed that the}} election would be held in January 2015. Critics of Rajapaksa, including the Bar Association and former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva, claimed {{that he could not}} stand for re-election as he had won his second term before the eighteenth amendment to the constitution had been passed. In early November 2014 Rajapaksa sought the Supreme Court's opinion on whether <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stand</b> for re-election. The court ruled that Rajapaksa could stand for re-election. The independence of the Supreme Court has been questioned since the UPFA impeached former Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake, allowing Rajapaksa to appoint an ally and legal adviser, former Attorney General Mohan Peiris, as Chief Justice.|$|E
25|$|This {{was brought}} to {{national}} attention on October 7, 2003 when Philadelphia Police conducted a sweep of Mayor John F. Street’s office and found an electronic listening device. It was later discovered that the “bug” had been planted by the FBI {{as part of a}} city corruption investigation. Street was never charged in the investigation. Philadelphia officials and the mayor were outraged, especially with the timing coinciding with the Philadelphia mayoral election on November 4, 2003. Street’s campaign spokesman {{went so far as to}} accuse the federal government of attempting to influence the election (which Street ended up winning anyway). Meehan was applauded in the press and in the city for his handling of the situation, which resulted in twelve indictments including that of Street confidant Ronald White (who died before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stand</b> trial) and city treasurer Corey Kemp, who was convicted and sentenced to ten years in federal prison.|$|E
500|$|Speaker {{became the}} regular {{starting}} center fielder for Boston in 1909 and light-hitting Denny Sullivan {{was sold to}} the Cleveland Naps. Speaker hit [...]309 in 143games as the team {{finished third in the}} pennant race. Defensively, Speaker was involved in 12 double plays, leading the league's outfielders, and had a [...]973fielding percentage, third among outfielders. In [...] the Red Sox signed left fielder Duffy Lewis. Speaker, Lewis and Harry Hooper formed Boston's [...] "Million-Dollar Outfield", one of the finest outfield trios in baseball history. Speaker was the star of the Million-Dollar Outfield. He ran fast enough that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stand</b> very close to second base, effectively giving the team a fifth infielder, but he still caught the balls hit to center field. [...] In 1910 and 1911, Boston finished fourth in the American League standings.|$|E

500|$|The Utah {{portion of}} I-70 was not {{completed}} to Interstate Highway standards until 1990, {{when the second}} Eagle Canyon bridge was dedicated. A second dedication ceremony {{was held at the}} bridge declaring the Utah portion of I-70 complete. Archie Hamilton, one of three engineers who worked for Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) long enough to see I-70 progress from conception to completion, said the most memorable moment was seeing the excavation at Spotted Wolf Canyon. He said before construction began, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stand</b> in one spot and touch both sides of the canyon. To carve the first [...] through the canyon required excavating [...] of rock. It was estimated construction cost for the San Rafael Swell portion was $183.5million, $105.5million (1970, $595million in 2008) to build the first two lanes, and $78million (1990, $130million in 2008) to construct the rest. At the 1970 dedication, it was noted the cost of land acquisition helped to offset the cost of the massive excavation. UDOT acquired the right of way to build the majority of I-70 from the BLM at the lowest cost per mile of any highway in Utah.|$|E
500|$|Kotaku's Owen Good called Dogmeat [...] "one of the franchise's most iconic characters" [...] {{as well as}} its [...] "one of {{the most}} motionally {{fulfilling}} features." [...] The book Level Up!: The Guide to Great Video Game Design by Scott Rogers used him as an example while discussing how the [...] "party members don't need to be human". In 2008, UGO Team stated this [...] "undisputed champion of Fallout characters" [...] is not [...] "only our favorite Fallout character, he's also one of gaming's greatest dogs." [...] That same year, Joe Martin of Bit-tech ranked Dogmeat as the sixth top PC game NPC of all time, commenting: [...] "There are a lot of computer game characters we like and a few we’d even {{go so far as to}} say we love. Dogmeat though, despite being a definite tabula rasa, sits in a different category altogether and is the only computer game character that we’d reload and repeat significant portions of a game for, just so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stand</b> a better chance of survival." [...] In 2009, Michael Fiegel of The Escapist called Dogmeat possibly the most beloved character of the Fallout universe, writing that [...] "in an uncaring wasteland ... Dogmeat is a moral compass: Though your needle might swing towards good or evil, his center always holds strong provided you protect him." [...] Steve and Larson of ScrewAttack ranked Dogmeat as the tenth best gaming pet in 2011. Dogmeat was included in numerous lists of best video game dogs, including by Lisa Foiles of The Escapist in 2010, Michael Perry of PlayStation Official Magazine in 2012, Gergo Vas of Kotaku in 2013, and Benjamin Abbott of Metro, Brian Taylor of Paste, and the staff of Bild in 2014. Ryan McCaffrey of IGN chose Dogmeat as the top feature he wished to return in Fallout 4.|$|E

2500|$|Garrison {{was buried}} in the Forest Hills Cemetery in Boston's Jamaica Plain {{neighborhood}} on May 28, 1879. At the public memorial service, eulogies were given by Theodore Dwight Weld and Wendell Phillips. Eight abolitionist friends, both white and black, served as his pallbearers. Flags were flown at half-staff all across Boston. Frederick Douglass, then employed as a United States Marshal, spoke in memory of Garrison at a memorial service in a church in Washington, D.C., saying, [...] "It was the glory of this man that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stand</b> alone with the truth, and calmly await the result." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Harry Schwarz will {{be remembered}} for his signal {{contribution}} to the development of our democracy. His piercing intellect, and long professional experience in banking, made him the most astute analyst in Parliament on economic and financial matters during his terms in office. He had strong leadership qualities and could inspire people to great achievements. He was an outstanding debater, both inside and outside Parliament. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>stand</b> his ground against all-comers. His principled and steadfast resistance to racial nationalism was rooted in the key role he played in fighting Nazism during World War 2. He continued his resistance to racial nationalism through his long and distinguished career in South African opposition politics. He has engraved his place in South Africa's political history. We will always remember him".|$|E
2500|$|Roosevelt {{was totally}} and {{permanently}} {{paralyzed from the}} waist down, and unable to stand or walk without support. [...] For the next few months, he confined himself to indoor pursuits, including resuming his lifelong hobby of stamp collecting. [...] In December 1921, after he had recuperated for several months, a physiotherapist began working with him {{to determine the extent}} of the damage. He was able to perform small exercises on his own, moving one muscle and then another. He was fitted with heavy steel braces that locked at the knee and provided enough stability that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stand</b> with crutches. In 1922, at Springwood, he worked diligently to make his way across the room. He set himself the goal of getting down the long driveway, managing to do it once, but never trying again.|$|E

2500|$|Initially a piano player, Emerson {{obtained}} {{his first}} Hammond organ, an L-100, after hearing jazz organist Jack McDuff and becoming frustrated with broken hammers inside pianos. Around 1968, {{during his time}} with the Nice, he added a second Hammond organ, the more expensive C-3, and would place the two organs sideways and facing each other so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stand</b> between the two keyboards and play both with his unobstructed body facing the audience. Emerson preferred {{the sound of the}} C-3 as being [...] "far superior" [...] to the cheaper L-100, and used the L100 to [...] "throw around and make it feed back". Emerson got the L-100 to feed back by placing it close to the onstage speakers and using a fuzzbox. He continued to perform physical abuse stunts with the L-100 to some degree throughout his years with ELP.|$|E
2500|$|Of {{the over}} 1,000 Australian {{soldiers}} taken prisoner, around 160 were massacred {{on or about}} 4 February 1942 in four separate incidents around Tol and Waitavalo. Six men survived these killings and later described {{what had happened to}} a Court of Inquiry. The Australian government concluded the prisoners were marched into the jungle near Tol Plantation in small groups and were then bayoneted by Japanese soldiers. At the nearby Waitavalo Plantation, another group of Australian prisoners were shot. The Allies later placed responsibility for the incident on Masao Kusunose, the commanding officer of the 144th Infantry Regiment, but in late 1946 he starved himself to death before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stand</b> trial. At least 800 soldiers and 200 civilian prisoners of war—most of them Australian—lost their lives on 1 July 1942, when the ship on which they were being transported from Rabaul to Japan, the Montevideo Maru, was sunk off the north coast of Luzon by the U.S. submarine [...]|$|E
2500|$|Hybrid III, the 50th {{percentile}} male dummy {{which made}} its first appearance in 1976, is the familiar crash test dummy, {{and he is now}} a family man. If <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stand</b> upright, he would be 175cm (5'9") tall and would have a mass of 77kg (170lb). He occupies the driver's seat in all the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) 65km/h (40mph) offset frontal crash tests. He is joined by a [...] "big brother", the 95th percentile Hybrid III, at 188cm (6ft 2 in) and 100kg (223lb). Ms. Hybrid III is a 5th percentile female dummy, at a diminutive 152cm (5ft) tall and 50kg (110lb). The three Hybrid III child dummies represent a ten-year-old, 21kg (47lb) six-year-old, and a 15kg (33lb) three-year-old. The child models are very recent additions to the crash test dummy family; because so little hard data are available on the effects of accidents on children and such data are very difficult to obtain, these models are based in large part on estimates and approximations. [...] The primary benefit provided by the Hybrid III is improved neck response in forward flexion and head rotation that better simulates the human.|$|E
