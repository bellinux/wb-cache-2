I hadn't heard anything, {{and a couple of}} weeks later, all of the sudden, I got the call saying, 'You're going to Vancouver to start shooting Smallville.' It's a dream come true, really." [...] Aaron Ashmore's twin, Shawn, who is better known as Bobby [...] "Iceman" [...] Drake in the X-Men film series, appeared in two episodes of Smallville as the power leeching Eric Summers. After three seasons with the show, two as a series regular, Ashmore was written out of the series. According to Ashmore, when the producers were first trying to get permission to use the character on Smallville, DC Comics had qualms over how close Jimmy was in age to Clark and Lois, as the character was supposed to be at least ten years younger. The producers guaranteed the department they would eventually reveal the Jimmy Olsen who appeared on the show was not the Jimmy Olsen who would one <b>day</b> <b>work</b> alongside Clark and Lois. At the character's funeral, his full name is shown to be [...] "Henry James Olsen", and it is alluded that Jimmy's younger brother, who is given a brief appearance at the funeral, is the DC Comics version of Jimmy Olsen who will one <b>day</b> <b>work</b> at the Daily Planet with Clark and Lois. Although Ashmore was sad to leave the show, he feels that the redemptive story that was given to Jimmy in the finale, through the self-sacrifice he makes for Chloe, makes a good send off for his character.|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 2012, Stevenage {{announced}} that they had rejected several bids for Roberts, along with defensive partner Jon Ashton, from fellow League One side Doncaster Rovers. Despite the strong transfer speculation over the summer, he captained the side in Stevenage's {{first game of the}} 2012–13 season, scoring the third goal in a 3–1 win over AFC Wimbledon in the League Cup. Shortly after the game, Stevenage released a statement announcing they would not be selling Roberts during the season. His second goal of the campaign came in another cup competition, scoring from close range to briefly restore parity in a 3–2 defeat away to Dagenham & Redbridge in the Football League Trophy in September 2012. Roberts scored his first league goal of the season in Stevenage's 4–1 loss to Sheffield United at Bramall Lane, scoring an equaliser just before half-time, heading in Filipe Morais's corner. In February 2013, Roberts was one of three players shortlisted by the Football League for the Player in the Community award {{as a result of his}} work in the local community over the past few years. The club stated — [...] "we are extremely proud that Mark has been shortlisted for this award, he is a credit to the football club and his day to <b>day</b> <b>work</b> and support of the community scheme and the club's community work is due worthy recognition". Following the departure of manager Gary Smith in March 2013, Roberts was once again placed in temporary charge while the club searched for a new manager. Just four days later, he took charge of Stevenage's televised away trip to promotion-chasing Tranmere Rovers, which ended in a 3–1 defeat. In Stevenage's next match, on 29 March 2013, Roberts scored a first-half header in a 1–1 away draw with Crawley Town, briefly giving Stevenage the lead despite them having to play with ten men for most of the match following Miguel Comminges' early dismissal. In what was his last match in caretaker charge, Roberts stated he was [...] "proud of the phenomenal performance", and that [...] "the attitude, the way the lads reacted to the adversity we faced was probably something I haven't seen all season, to that level anyway". A day later, Graham Westley was re-appointed as Stevenage manager, who brought Roberts to the club in 2008, and as a result Roberts was again able to concentrate solely on the playing side of his game. He played 48 times during the season, scoring four goals. During his successful four-and-a-half year spell at Stevenage, Roberts made 239 appearances in all competitions, an appearance record that places him sixth on the club's all-time appearance list, and scored 27 goals.|$|E
