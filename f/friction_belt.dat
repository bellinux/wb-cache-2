50|$|The viola organista is {{a musical}} {{instrument}} designed by Leonardo da Vinci. It uses a <b>friction</b> <b>belt</b> to vibrate individual strings (similar to how a violin produces sounds), with the strings selected by pressing keys on a keyboard (similar to an organ). Leonardo's design has intrigued instrument makers for more than 400 years. But though similar instruments have been built, no extant instrument constructed directly from Leonardo's incomplete designs is known.|$|E

50|$|It is {{not known}} if Leonardo ever built a working {{prototype}} of this instrument. The first similar instrument actually to be constructed was the Geigenwerk of 1575 by Hans Heyden, a German instrument inventor. However, Geigenwerk {{is not based on}} Leonardo's designs. It uses several friction wheels instead of a <b>friction</b> <b>belt</b> to vibrate the strings, and requires two people to play it: one to turn the crank to put the rosined wheels in motion, and the other to work the keys.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, several songs {{feature the}} Viola Organista, a unique {{instrument}} designed by Leonardo da Vinci but {{built for the}} first time centuries later by Polish musician Sławomir Zubrzycki. Björk described how the instrument works: [...] "...(it) uses a <b>friction</b> <b>belt</b> to vibrate individual strings (similar to a violin), with the strings selected by pressing keys on the keyboard (similar to an organ)." [...] Björk first contacted Zubrzycki by email in 2013 after discovering him on YouTube. She stated, [...] "...like everyone else (I) was just completely blown away. Obviously I wanted to run to Poland, like, NOW, and just record whatever. But I've learned over the years that it's good to not be too impatient." [...] Björk's commitment to her Biophilia Tour, followed immediately by composing and recording duties on Vulnicura, delayed their collaboration until mid-2015, when Björk contacted Zubrzycki again asking him to take part in this new version of Vulnicura.|$|E

50|$|Eventually, as tractor {{horsepower}} increased, the thrower-baler became possible, which {{eliminated the}} need for someone {{to stand on the}} wagon and pick up the finished bales. The first thrower mechanism used two fast-moving <b>friction</b> <b>belts</b> to grab finished bales and throw them at an angle up in the air onto the bale wagon. The bale wagon was modified from a flatbed into a three-sided skeleton frame open at the front, to act as a catcher's net for the thrown bales.|$|R
50|$|<b>Belt</b> <b>friction</b> {{is a term}} {{describing}} the friction forces between a belt and a surface, such as a belt wrapped around a bollard. When {{one end of the}} belt is being pulled only part of this force is transmitted to the other end wrapped about a surface. The friction force increases with the amount of wrap about a surface and makes it so the tension in the belt can be different {{at both ends of the}} <b>belt.</b> <b>Belt</b> <b>friction</b> can be modeled by the <b>Belt</b> <b>friction</b> equation.|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to design and develop a glide control {{mechanism}} for a middle aged client with autism at the Monson Developmental Center. The client enjoyed propelling himself backward in his wheelchair which could often pose a safety hazard if he ran into objects or into other people. The development of an attachable glide control mechanism would prevent the wheelchair from excessive gliding while still maintaining its freedom of motion. The design team first created a list of preliminary design concepts that would all {{reduce the amount of}} glide when attached to the wheelchair. These concepts included bicycle brake calipers, a friction clutch, a <b>friction</b> <b>belt,</b> a “Wheel of Fortune” friction device, a dragging brake, an electromagnetic device, a piston device, and a rotating brake. Lists of advantages and disadvantages were created for each device, and then each design was rated based on a priority matrix. After further analysis of cost and feasibility, the <b>friction</b> <b>belt</b> was chosen for development into a prototype. This design would include two belts which press against two hubs that are attached to the wheels of the wheelchair. The tension that this setup creates results in a greater frictional force between the belt and the hub, decreasing the ability of the wheels to rotate freely. The device was developed and tested for maneuverability, glide limitation, safety, wheel balance, and accessibility to the client. The device was then tested by the client and {{it was found that the}} glide control mechanism appropriately limited the speed that the wheelchair was able to reach, without inhibiting the mobility of the wheelchair...|$|E
40|$|To date, the {{majority}} of existing Condition Indicators for gears are based on various statistical moments of a recorded time history. A supplementary analysis proposed in this study, shall suggest an approach that may, in the future, enable the identification of faulty gearwheel and possibly fault type in the system. In this work, a combined analytical and empiric approach is applied. This approach {{is based on the}} assumption that reliable dynamic models can be utilized to predict the effects of faults on vibrational patterns. Dynamic model generated signatures are used to verify experimental findings. Moreover, discrepancies between simulated and actual results, combined with understanding of the assumptions and omissions of the model, are helpful in understanding and explaining the experimental results. A spur gear transmission setup was used for experiments, along with an electric AC motor and a <b>friction</b> <b>belt</b> loading device. The experimental runs were conducted at varying speed settings. Two types of faults, a tooth face fault and a tooth root fault, were seeded in the experimental transmission and into the model. The effect on extracted signal features is examined. The purpose of this study is to evaluate fault detection capabilities of proposed diagnostic tools at the presence of two seeded faults of varying severity, verified by a dynamic model. Observed differences between examined fault types and their manifestation will be discussed. A basis for future work on prognostics capabilities is laid by a varying degree of tooth root fault...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{proof of concept}} of a variable stiffness actuator (VSA) that uses only one (high power) input motor. In general, VSAs use two (high power) motors {{to be able to}} control both the output position and the output stiffness, which possibly results in a heavy, and bulky system. In this work, two small and light-weight clutches are used to lock either one of the degrees of freedom, allowing the other to be controlled by the input motor. These clutches are realized by <b>friction</b> <b>belts</b> that can engage to a surrounding cylinder. The clutches are operated by solenoids, and small bistable mechanisms ensure that no electrical energy is lost in keeping a degree of freedom locked or unlocked.

40|$|AbstractDynamic rope brakes are {{integral}} {{elements of the}} standard belaying equipment. They multiply the hand force of the belayer and convert {{a fraction of the}} falling climber’s kinetic energy into thermal energy. As the rope is deflected by the brake, the thermal energy is produced by <b>belt</b> <b>friction.</b> This paper introduces a brake model based on static and viscous <b>belt</b> <b>friction.</b> The contact angles of three different brakes (figure-of-eight, ATC and HMS [Munter hitch]) were determined. These data as well as data taken and/or derived from the literature served as input for the model. The static and viscous <b>belt</b> <b>friction</b> coefficients range between 0. 2 – 0. 3 and 0. 015 – 0. 04, respectively, for the three brakes. Depending on the magnitude of the friction coefficients, three conditions can be distinguished: (1) no rope slip at high friction; (2) rope slip and stop; (3) critical braking; and (4) continuous rope slip (no stop). The window of the friction coefficients between no slip and critical braking is independent of the hand force. However, the smaller the hand force is, the larger are the friction coefficients at no slip and critical braking. Belayers with smaller hand forces should therefore avoid rope brakes with small static and viscous friction coefficients (like the Figure-ofEight) and apply the ATC or HMS...|$|R
