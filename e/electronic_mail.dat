25|$|The Internet is {{the global}} system of {{interconnected}} computer networks {{that use the}} Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by {{a broad array of}} electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), <b>electronic</b> <b>mail,</b> telephony, and file sharing.|$|E
25|$|Modern mail is {{organized}} by national and privatized services, which are reciprocally interconnected by international regulations, organizations and international agreements. Paper letters and parcels {{can be sent}} to almost any country in the world relatively easily and cheaply. The Internet has made the process of sending letter-like messages nearly instantaneous, and in many cases and situations correspondents use <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> where previously they would have used letters. The volume of paper mail sent through the U.S. Postal Service has declined by more than 15% since its peak at 213 billion pieces per annum in 2006.|$|E

25|$|Telegraphy {{requires}} that the method used for encoding the message be known to both sender and receiver. Many methods are designed according {{to the limits of}} the signalling medium used. The use of smoke signals, beacons, reflected light signals, and flag semaphore signals are early examples. In the 19th century, the harnessing of electricity led to the invention of electrical telegraphy. The advent of radio in the early 20th century brought about radiotelegraphy and other forms of wireless telegraphy. In the Internet age, telegraphic means developed greatly in sophistication and ease of use, with natural language interfaces that hide the underlying code, allowing such technologies as <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> and instant messaging.|$|E
25|$|A Bulletin Board System, or BBS, is a {{computer}} system running software that allows users to connect and log into the system using a terminal program. Once logged in, a user can perform functions such as uploading and downloading software and data, reading news and bulletins, and exchanging messages with other users, either through <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> or in public message boards. Many BBSes also offer on-line games, in which users can compete with each other, and BBSes with multiple phone lines often provide chat rooms, allowing users to interact with each other. CBBS, the first Bulletin Board System, was invented by Ward Christensen and Randy Suess in Chicago, becoming fully operational on February 16, 1978.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the 1980s, SRI {{developed}} Zylon, stealth technologies, {{improvements to}} ultrasound imaging, two-dimensional laser fluorescence imaging, and order-sorted algebra. In computing and software, SRI developed a multimedia <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> system, {{a theory of}} non-interference in computer security, a multilevel secure (MLS) relational database system called Seaview, LaTeX, Open Agent Architecture (OAA), a network intrusion detection system, the Maude system, a declarative software language, and PacketHop, a peer-to-peer wireless technology to create scalable ad hoc networks. [...] SRI's research in network intrusion detection led to the patent infringement case SRI International, Inc. v. Internet Security Systems, Inc. The AI center's robotics research led to Shakey's successor, Flakey the robot, which focused on fuzzy logic.|$|E

2500|$|Thomas Haigh, a {{historian}} {{of information technology}} at the University of Wisconsin, wrote that [...] "Ayyadurai is, {{to the best of}} my knowledge, the only person to have claimed for him or herself the title 'inventor of email'." [...] Haigh argued that while EMAIL was impressive for a teenager's work, it contained no features that were not present on previous <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> systems and had no obvious influence on later systems. [...] "The most striking thing about Ayyadurai's claim to have invented <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> is how late it comes. Somehow it took him thirty years to alert the world to [...] greatest achievement". Haigh wrote that by 1980, [...] "electronic mail had been in use at MIT for 15 years, Xerox had built a modern, mouse-driven graphical email system for office communication, Compuserve was selling email access to the public, and email had for many years been the most popular application on what was soon to become the Internet." ...|$|E

2500|$|V. A. Shiva Ayyadurai is an Indian-born American {{scientist}} and entrepreneur. Ayyadurai is notable for his controversial {{claim to be}} the [...] "inventor of email", based on the <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> software called [...] "EMAIL" [...] he wrote as a New Jersey high school student in the late 1970s. Initial reports that repeated Ayyadurai's assertion—from organizations such as The Washington Post and the Smithsonian Institution—were followed by public retractions. These corrections were triggered by objections from historians and ARPANET pioneers who pointed out that email was already actively used in the early 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|A November 2011 Time Techland {{interview}} by Doug Aamoth entitled [...] "The Man Who Invented Email" [...] {{argued that the}} EMAIL program Ayyadurai had written as a 14-year old represented the birth of email [...] "as we currently know it". [...] In that interview, Ayyadurai recalled that Les Michelson, the former particle scientist at Brookhaven National Labs who assigned Ayyadurai the project, had {{the idea of creating}} an <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> system that uses the header conventions of a hardcopy memorandum. Ayyadurai recalled Michelson as saying: [...] "Your job is to convert that into an electronic format. Nobody's done that before." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ayyadurai {{characterized}} the earlier work of Tomlinson, Tom Van Vleck {{and others as}} text messaging, rather than an electronic version of an interoffice mail system. [...] Responding to his critics on his personal website, Ayyadurai described his program EMAIL as [...] "the first of its kind—a fully integrated, database-driven, electronic translation of the interoffice paper mail system derived from the ordinary office situation." [...] Ayyadurai maintained that EMAIL was the first <b>electronic</b> <b>mail</b> system to integrate an easy-to-use user interface, a word processor, a relational database, and a modular inter-communications protocol [...] "integrated together in one single and holistic platform to ensure high-reliability and user-friendliness network-wide." ...|$|E
