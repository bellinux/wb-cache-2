25|$|Internet {{access in}} an act of {{unprecedented}} Internet censorship. About 3,500 Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routes to Egyptian networks were shut down from about 12:10am to 12:35am 28 January. The shutdown happened within the space of a few tens of minutes, not instantaneously. According to Renesys, Telecom Egypt started shutting down at 12:12am, Raya/Vodafone at 12:13am, Link Egypt at 12:17am, Etisalat Misr at 12:19am, and Internet Egypt at 12:25am. Renesys interpreted the shutdown as people getting phone calls one at a time, telling them to take themselves off the air, rather than an automated system taking all providers down at once. Facebook confirmed a decrease in traffic from Egypt. A Border Gateway Protocol monitoring site in Vancouver, Canada, reported most of the primary AS (ISPs) dropping a large percentage if not all of route advertisements. Virtually all of Egypt's Internet addresses were unreachable, worldwide. In response, Egyptians used smartphones as modems, and even land lines with dial-up modems to make international calls to access the <b>internet,</b> <b>fax</b> machines in universities and embassies, and ham radio to circumvent the restrictions. Furthermore, the sole remaining functioning ISP, Noor, which had had eight percent of the market share in Egypt (but which connected the Egyptian stock market and many western companies to the outside world), has been reported by Tor, an anonymity network, on 30 January to be the source of a quadrupling of Tor clients from Egypt within twenty-four hours as of 30 January; the use of Tor has skyrocketed due to the situation in Egypt.|$|E

This paper proposes an integrated <b>Internet</b> <b>faxing</b> environment, known as FaxPortal, to support different modes of <b>Internet</b> <b>faxing</b> including the use of email, the World Wide Web, and conventional fax devices. FaxPortal's architecture comprises two servers, namely, the Faxing and Fax Receiving Servers. The Faxing Server accepts and converts fax messages into fax-image files for transmission over the <b>Internet.</b> The <b>Fax</b> Receiving Server receives these files and sends them to fax devices over the PSTN. Additionally, FaxPortal has adopted a scheme with three different transportation classes to simplify the support for global fax coverage. 1. INTRODUCTION Fax messages are usually capt [...] ...|$|R
