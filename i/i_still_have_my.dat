2500|$|On July 3, 2009 it was {{announced}} that Storm would be coming out of retirement to perform at two Ring of Honor shows on July 24 and 25, Death Before Dishonor VII: Nights 1 and 2 respectively. On July 24, Storm and fellow Canadian Kevin Steen defeated Chris Hero and Davey Richards and on July 25, Storm was defeated by Hero in a one-on-one grudge match. Following the match, Storm cut an emotional promo, and later announced his belief that this would be his last match, saying [...] "I shared this match with people who share my love and respect for this business, and I am now home being Lance Evers with the family I will share {{the rest of my life}} with. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> school, and I will always be a part of this business, but I truly believe I am now done as a performer. They say, never say never in this business, and because of that I won’t, but I think I left it all in the ring that night and I believe I wrote the final page in the 19-year long book that was the career of Lance Storm." ...|$|E

5000|$|Gislason is a {{recovering}} alcoholic. He said this in an 2014 interview: [...] "When I came put of rehab {{two and a}} half years ago I didn't feel good. I felt as I had lost at life.

50|$|Three or {{four years}} ago, when I was sitting in special sessions, my {{associates}} and I had occasion to sentence {{a young man who}} had been found guilty of petty larceny. In pronouncing sentence I said: 'I am convinced from the evidence that has been brought out here that you are lacking in moral sense, {{that at the end of}} your prison term you will go out and commit more. It is a wrong to the community that you should be so set at liberty, and it is a wrong to you that you should be allowed to follow your course without restraint.' One of the parents of my young man—he was barely twenty-one—told me tearfully that he was a good boy, the best of boys, but that he had been in bad company and tempted too far. Before he had served out his term his parent came to me again to tell me that now he had promised to reform and how well he was doing. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> doubts. —The Outlook, February 8, 1913.|$|R

60|$|Then, Sir, I brought {{upon the}} perilous {{situation}} that {{presence of mind}} for which the name of Hector Ratichon will for ever remain famous.

5000|$|That year, {{the trio}} {{went back on}} tour {{together}} which carried through the spring of 2009. In {{an interview with the}} Toronto Star, Patti LaBelle explained why she, Dash and Hendryx waited over 32 years to record a full-length album: [...] "You dont want to half-step something this important....it was about finding the right time and place. We were never ones to do anything on anyone elses time anyway; we were always unconventional. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> glitter boots to prove it." ...|$|E
5000|$|The next year, the Stinkers did {{nominate}} Hilton for Worst Actress for {{her performance}} in the barely released National Lampoon's Pledge This!. Society co-founder Lancaster {{had this to say}} about Hilton's nomination, [...] "It was like Paris was baiting us, I'm not sure why she needs us to confirm to her that she's a bad actress appearing in a bad movie, but if she has the nerve to play her movie in a theater five minutes from my house, I will take notice. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>my</b> ticket stub if any one doubts this film played in a theater.

5000|$|His 1985 book Rich and Poor, re-released by Steidl in an {{expanded}} edition in 2014, includes photographs {{of people in}} their homes along with handwritten comments by them about their lives.

60|$|I bore {{up against}} {{everything}} with some stubbornness of will and much rebellion of nature, till I had absolutely nothing {{left in the}} world but one thing. I <b>had</b> lost <b>my</b> name, my position, my happiness, my freedom, my wealth. I was a prisoner and a pauper. But <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>my</b> children left. Suddenly they were taken away from me by the law. It was a blow so appalling that I {{did not know what to}} do, so I flung myself on my knees, and bowed my head, and wept, and said, 'The body of a child is as the body of the Lord: I am not worthy of either.' That moment seemed to save me. I saw then that the only thing for me was to accept everything. Since then--curious as it will no doubt sound--I have been happier. It was of course my soul in its ultimate essence that I had reached. In many ways I had been its enemy, but I found it waiting for me as a friend. When one comes in contact with the soul it makes one simple as a child, as Christ said one should be.|$|R

May they keep for themselves, and give to those who merit and desire it, some memento from among the possessions, religious objects or books belonging to me. May the notes, notebooks, correspondence and my personal writings be destroyed.|$|R
