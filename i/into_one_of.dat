5|$|A {{benzodiazepine}} can {{be placed}} <b>into</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> three groups by its elimination half-life, or {{time it takes for}} the body to eliminate half of the dose. Some benzodiazepines have long-acting active metabolites, such as diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, which are metabolised into desmethyldiazepam. Desmethyldiazepam has a half-life of 36–200 hours, and flurazepam, with the main active metabolite of desalkylflurazepam, with a half-life of 40–250 hours. These long-acting metabolites are partial agonists.|$|E
5|$|Buddhism {{long held}} that the tengu were {{disruptive}} demons and s of war. Their image gradually softened, however, <b>into</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> protective, if still dangerous, spirits of the mountains and forests.

5|$|From the 18th to 20th century, it {{was home}} to Vine Street Police Station, which grew from a watch-house <b>into</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the busiest police {{stations}} in the world. The Marquess of Queensberry was charged with libel against Oscar Wilde here in 1895. There was also a court house in the 18th and early 19th century. The street's association with law has led to it being grouped with Bow Street and Marlborough Street on the standard British Monopoly board.|$|E

It was reprinted numerous times, including in unauthorized editions.|$|E

5|$|It {{was in the}} 19th {{century that}} Leeds began to grow <b>into</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Britain's largest cities. This led to {{widespread}} building across the city. Leeds' wool and cloth trades resulted {{in the building of}} many industrial buildings during this era. The resulting workforce which migrated to the city from rural areas brought about the building of many houses. Leeds has perhaps the most surviving examples of back-to-back terrace housing in the UK, particularly in Holbeck and Harehills.|$|E

5|$|Not {{only were}} such monasteries an {{expression}} of David's undoubted piety, but they also functioned to transform Scottish society. Monasteries became centres of foreign influence, and provided sources of literate men, able to serve the crown's growing administrative needs. These new monasteries, and the Cistercian ones in particular, introduced new agricultural practices. Cistercian labour, for instance, transformed southern Scotland <b>into</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> northern Europe's most important sources of sheep wool.|$|E

5|$|Piccadilly was {{increasingly}} developed {{and by the}} middle of the 18th century it was continuously built on as far as Hyde Park Corner. The development of St James's and Mayfair in particular made Piccadilly <b>into</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the busiest roads in London. Hugh Mason and William Fortnum started the Fortnum & Mason partnership on Piccadilly in 1705, selling recycled candles from Buckingham Palace. By 1788, the store sold poultry, potted meats, lobsters and prawns, savoury patties, Scotch eggs, and fresh and dried fruits.|$|E

5|$|The Mary Rose was {{substantially}} rebuilt in 1536.
