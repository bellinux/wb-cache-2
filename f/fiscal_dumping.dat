40|$|In United Europe, the {{economic}} policy proves common goals of prosperity and development, still each country is administrating its own policy mix in order to reshape the fiscal pressure and to safeguard {{the economic}} body of the society.

40|$|Fisheries play a {{key role}} in the {{livelihoods}} of many millions of people in developing countries. Policy Research - Implications of Liberalization of Fish Trade for Developing Countries provides a synthesis of research undert a ken on a number of issues and country case studies relating to fish trade liberalization and also presents a series of policy recommendations. The trade issues investigated include sanitary and phytosanitary measures, technical barriers to trade, subsidies, <b>dumping,</b> <b>fiscal</b> reforms, and the use of ethical, social, eco-labelling and certification. Country case studies were prepared for Bangladesh, Guinea, India, Uganda and Vietnam. The aim of this study is to increase our knowledge and understanding of the relationship between the achievement of sustainable development outcomes and the existing provisions of international fisheries, particularly multilateral trade rules and bilateral agreements. The book should be of interest to researchers and development practitioners involved with fisheries-based communities...|$|R
