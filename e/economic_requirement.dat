This study found that only if a complete overhaul of the tracks and rolling stock were to take place would it make sense to keep the narrow-gauge railways operational. It concluded that {{due to a lack of}} resources to rebuild the tracks and lack of capacity to construct and build new diesel locomotives, the closing of the narrow-gauge railways was not just a technical, but primarily an <b>economic</b> <b>requirement.</b> On May 14, 1964, the Ministerrat decided that all narrow-gauge railways of East Germany were to cease operations by 1975.

This approach unifies therefore the advantages of well-known forward price models with those of classical LIBOR rate models. Several examples are added and prototypical volatility smiles are shown. We believe that the CIR-process based LIBOR model might be of particular interest for applications, since closed form valuation formulas for caps and swaptions are derived. ...|$|E

40|$|Solvency-both as an <b>economic</b> <b>requirement</b> in {{the market}} and as a {{regulatory}} and supervisory tool-is critical to all insurance markets. Current market conditions, coupled with expected institutional changes, will place particular burdens on emerging and developing markets. Institutional solvency, effective risk management within companies, effective supervisory oversight, and the development of market disciplines are all linked. The author proposes that the effective implementation of the emerging regime needs a careful and diligent phased process of capacity-building. The first priorities are identified as a strong supervisor, a basic solvency margin requirement, and the initiation of efforts to gather appropriate data sets. This can be followed by advancing development of more sophisticated solvency regulation, increased use of technical expertise, and increased use of market disciplines as the community and financial markets become more able to exercise such discipline.

The research analyzes the benefits derived from HERS-ST implementation using HERS-ST itself. The analysis compares a program based on a HERS-ST strategy to that based on a worst first strategy using Highway Performance Monitoring System data from the State of New Mexico. The analysis estimates that average pavement condition based on HERS-ST is 0. 30 points, on a scale of zero to five higher than that based on a worst first strategy over 10 years. Also, HERS-ST identifies benefits of $ 2. 0 billion over the benefit-cost analysis period and benefits of $ 359 million over 10 years. If the cost for HERS-ST implementation is lower than those benefits over the periods, investment in HERS-ST implementation can be justified...|$|E

This essay examines historical and contemporary representations of the black male body that perpetuate the exploitation of Fijians by inscribing the Fijian male body as warrior, criminal and protector. Taking a multidisciplinary approach informed by sociology, cultural theory, Pacific studies, visual culture, feminist and post-colonial theory, my practice is the vehicle through which I address issues of neocolonial commodification of Fijian bodies. Through an analysis of my own staged photographs and vernacular images taken by Fijians working for private security military companies and British and US armies, I hope to challenge audiences to consider their own perceptions of Fijian agency and subjectivity. By theorising the politicisation of the black body and interrogating colonial representations of blackness, I argue that {{we can begin to}} create links between the historical and contemporary exploitation of Fijians and that at the essence of both is an underlying racial hierarchy and <b>economic</b> <b>requirement</b> for cheap and, arguably, expendable labour. <br /...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Sustainable product {{development}} (SPD) requires that product designs achieve minimal or zero environmental impacts, {{in addition to}} satisfying the traditional design criteria, such as product functionality, quality, features, costs, and time to market. Environmental evaluations must, therefore, {{be incorporated into the}} design stage. In this research, a product design process model is proposed that includes three design requirements, two design tasks, and three comprehensive assessment streams. The functional requirement is derived from the customers’ needs, reflecting the product’s functional purpose; the environmental requirement reflects society’s need for protecting natural resources and the environment; and, the <b>economic</b> <b>requirement</b> ensures the company’s basic business goals. Accordingly, SPD aims to simultaneously carry out the two tasks of designing products ’ physical and lifecycle structures. In the assessment phase of product design, three assessment streams, including lifecycle quality (LCQ) analysis, lifecycle assessment (LCA) and lifecycle cost (LCC), are conducted with respect to the functional, environmental, and economic evaluations. A process-based analysis concept is proposed for the analysis of LCQ, LCA, and LCC evaluations. A simplified LCA is used for the environmental evaluations. Detailed assessment techniques are also developed for effective design evaluations. A case study example is provided to illustrate the methods and models. Key Words: lifecycle engineering, sustainable product design, lifecycle quality, lifecycle assessment, lifecycle cost. 1...|$|E

30|$|As {{entrepreneurship}} is definitively seen as {{a powerful}} driver of growth and fortification in modern economy, policy makers claim that “Europe needs more new enterprises and innovation” (European Commission, 2012, p. 12). Entrepreneurship competences are defined as both, specific and cross curricular competencies (EACEA, 2012) which should be imparted and fostered in schools and in vocational training. To prepare young people to tackle today’s <b>economic</b> <b>requirement,</b> we try not only to give them economic basics but also to anchor entrepreneurship in the curricula of secondary II students, of vocational and higher education. To do this we not only claim a high sense of success, but also some of the described competences that deal {{with the ability to}} react fruitfully in critical situations. Considering the fact that half of the start-ups exit the market in their first five years of existence (Oser & Volery, 2012), it is fundamental to know how nascent entrepreneurs should (re)act in critical situations, how they can avoid failure and which cognitive aspects, personal attributes, beliefs are relevant in the context of bankruptcy to impart relevant aspects in vocational training. Summarized we identify two aspects being a challenge in research: first, we posit that young people need to develop both an entrepreneurial spirit/entrepreneurial competence and a competence related to failing. Second, as “the essence of entrepreneurship is action” (Morris et al. 2013, p. 352) we claim to concretize entrepreneurial acting in critical situations against the backdrop of failure.|$|E

These factors contribute to mount the <b>economic</b> <b>requirement</b> for Health Monitoring and Condition Monitoring of the systems. When a defect is happened in such system result in reduced energy loss rates from related process and due to it Condition Monitoring techniques that detecting energy loss are very difficult if not possible to use. However, {{in the case of}} Acoustic Emission (AE) technique this issue is partly overcome and is well suited for detecting very small energy release rates. Acoustic Emission (AE) as a technique is more than 50 years old and in this new technology the sounds associated with the failure of materials were detected. Acoustic wave is a non-stationary signal which can discover elastic stress waves in a failure component, capable of online monitoring, and is very sensitive to the fault diagnosis. In this paper the history and background of discovering and developing AE is discussed, different ages of developing AE which include Age of Enlightenment (1950 - 1967), Golden Age of AE (1967 - 1980), Period of Transition (1980 -Present). In the next section the application of AE condition monitoring in machinery process and various systems that applied AE technique in their health monitoring is discussed. In the end an experimental result is proposed by QUT test rig which an outer race bearing fault was simulated to depict the sensitivity of AE for detecting incipient faults in low speed high frequency machine...|$|E
