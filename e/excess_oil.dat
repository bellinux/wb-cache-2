25|$|Iran {{has been}} storing some unsold oil on tankers in the Persian Gulf, {{and it is}} {{building}} new storage tanks on shore. Iran has stored <b>excess</b> <b>oil</b> (21 million barrels, according to Citigroup Global Markets) {{to try to keep}} production levels up—shutting down wells risks harming them and it is costly and time consuming to resume production at a well that has been shut. However, since July 2012, Iran reportedly has been forced to shut down some wells, and overall oil production has fallen to about 2.6 million barrels per day from the level of nearly 4.0 mbd at the end of 2011.|$|E
25|$|The world's largest {{deposits}} of bitumen are in Canada, although Venezuela's {{deposits of}} extra-heavy crude oil are even bigger. Canada has vast energy resources {{of all types}} and its {{oil and natural gas}} resource base would be large enough to meet Canadian needs for generations if demand was sustained. Abundant hydroelectric resources account for the majority of Canada's electricity production and very little electricity is produced from oil. In a scenario with oil prices above US$100, Canada would have more than enough energy to meet its growing needs, with the <b>excess</b> <b>oil</b> production from its oil sands probably going to export. The major importing country would probably continue to be the United States, although before the developments in 2014, there was increasing demand for oil, particularly heavy oil, from Asian countries such as China and India.|$|E
25|$|Land Rover's radically updated {{product line}} was {{launched}} in 1983. Initially only the long-wheelbase One Ten was available and it was sold with the same engine line-up as the preceding Series III model- 2.25-litre petrol and diesel engines and the 3.5-litre Rover V8. However, Land Rover planned a series of rolling improvements. Launched shortly before the short-wheelbase Ninety model in 1984 was a 2.5-litre diesel engine. This {{was little more than}} an updated version of the existing diesel unit (at this time 22 years old). The stroke was lengthened to improve torque, and an updated cylinder head was used to reduce noise and emissions. A more modern injector pump improved fuel economy and an improved glow plug system improved cold-starting performance. The most significant change was the swapping of the chain-driven camshaft for one driven by a fibre toothed belt, which also drove the repositioned injector pump. The drive vacated by the injector pump was used to power a vacuum pump for the brake servo system. To reduce engine weight, extensive use of aluminium castings was made for the cambelt case, vacuum pump, rocker cover and other parts. Other small improvements were made such as the fitment of a spin-on cartridge oil filter instead of older, harder-to-change element type and the fitting of under-piston oil jets. In the mid-1980s Land Rover was part of the Land Rover Group, responsible for production of the Freight Rover van. The 2.5-litre diesel was fitted to the Freight Rover 300-series and the FX4 taxi (the engines for these applications had slight design changes, such as higher-mounted injector pumps and non-waterproof cambelt cases. They received the designations 14J and 15J respectively. Being fitted with a timing belt rather than a chain the 15J engine suffered none of the reliability problems in the FX4 that its 10J predecessor had encountered (see above)). The engine became a special-order only option after the introduction of turbodiesel engines (see below) but remained in production (and popular with military and some commercial buyers) until 1994. The British Army used this engine {{in the vast majority of}} the 20,000 Land Rovers it bought between 1985 and 1994. A manufacturing flaw with pistons combined with Army maintenance practises (such as a tendency to over-fill the sump with oil) caused the engines to over-breathe and ingest their oil, leading to piston failure. Late military-spec engines had a centrifugal separator in the breather system, allowing <b>excess</b> <b>oil</b> to drain back to the sump. These engines were designated 13J. and 11J (ref Land Rover Defender Military 110 1991 Supplementary Parts Catalogue). These later, modified engines were the first in their class (small capacity high-speed diesels) to pass the Ministry of Defence's arduous 500-hour durability trial.|$|E

Proponents of [...] "no poo" [...] believe that shampoo removes the natural oils (sebum) produced by the scalp, causing the scalp to produce more oil to compensate. They also believe that regular shampooing causes a [...] "vicious cycle" [...] to develop as it becomes necessary to shampoo regularly {{to compensate for the}} <b>excess</b> <b>oils</b> produced by the scalp (which are produced in response to being stripped from the scalp by the previous shampooing).|$|R

2500|$|Rotor sealing. This {{is still}} a minor problem as the engine housing has vastly {{different}} temperatures in each separate chamber section. The different expansion coefficients of the materials leads to imperfect sealing. Additionally, {{both sides of the}} seals are exposed to fuel, and the design does not allow for controlling the lubrication of the rotors accurately and precisely. Rotary engines tend to be overlubricated at all engine speeds and loads, and have relatively high oil consumption and other problems resulting from <b>excess</b> <b>oil</b> in the combustion areas of the engine, such as carbon formation and excessive emissions from burning oil. By comparison, a piston engine has all functions of a cycle in the same chamber giving a more stable temperature for piston rings to act against. Additionally, only one side of the piston in a (four-stroke) piston engine is being exposed to fuel, allowing for oil to lubricate the cylinders from the other side. Piston engine components can also be designed to increase ring sealing and oil control as cylinder pressures and power levels increase. To overcome the problems in a Wankel engine of differences in temperatures between different regions of housing and side and intermediary plates, and the associated thermal dilatation inequities, a heat pipe has been used to transport heat from the hot to the cold parts of engine. The [...] "heat pipes" [...] effectively direct hot exhaust gas to the cooler parts of the engine, with resulting decreases in efficiency and performance. In small-displacement, charge-cooled rotor, air-cooled housing Wankel engines, that has been shown to reduce the maximum engine temperature from 231°C to 129°C, and the maximum difference between hotter and colder regions of engine from 159°C to 18°C.|$|E

50|$|Small {{two-stroke}} engines, as for motorcycles and lawnmowers, use crankcase compression: {{the fuel}} mixture {{passes through the}} sump space in the crankcase. This precludes the use of both wet sump and dry sump systems, as <b>excess</b> <b>oil</b> here would contaminate the mixture, leading to <b>excess</b> <b>oil</b> being burned in the engine and so excessive hydrocarbon emissions. These engines are instead lubricated by petroil mixtures, where a carefully measured proportion of oil {{is added to the}} fuel tank (between 1:16 and 1:50 ratios). This oil is consumed immediately and entirely, so {{there is no need for}} a sump to collect and re-use it.|$|E

50|$|The oiling system {{inside a}} modern {{automotive}} or truck engine {{is similar in}} concept to the lube systems mentioned above, except that oil is pumped continuously. Much of this oil flows through passages drilled or cast into the engine block and cylinder heads, escaping through ports directly onto bearings, and squirting elsewhere to provide an oil bath. The oil pump simply pumps constantly, and any <b>excess</b> pumped <b>oil</b> continuously escapes through a relief valve back into the sump.|$|R

50|$|Oil {{pressure}} is higher when {{the engine is}} cold due to the increased viscosity of the oil, and also increases with engine speed until the relief valve in the oil pump opens to divert <b>excess</b> flow. <b>Oil</b> {{pressure is}} lowest under hot idling conditions, and the minimum pressure allowed by the manufacturer's tolerances is usually given at this point. Excessive oil pressure may indicate a blocked filter, blocked oil gallery or the wrong grade of oil. Low oil pressure indicates worn bearings or a broken oil pump.|$|R
