25|$|It is also {{believed}} that on June 12, 1892, Antonio Vélez Alvarado was at his apartment at 219 Twenty-Third Street in Manhattan, when <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> a Cuban flag for a few minutes, and then {{took a look at}} the blank wall in which it was being displayed. Vélez suddenly perceived an optical illusion, in which he perceived the image of the Cuban flag with the colors in the flag's triangle and stripes inverted. Almost immediately he visited a nearby merchant, Domingo Peraza, from whom he bought some crepe paper to build a crude prototype. He later displayed his prototype in a dinner meeting at his neighbor's house, where the owner, Micaela Dalmau vda. de Carreras, had invited José Martí as a guest.|$|E

2500|$|At Cranley Gardens, Nilsen had {{no access}} to a garden, and as he resided in an attic flat, {{he was unable to}} stow any bodies beneath his floorboards. For almost two months, any acquaintances Nilsen {{encountered}} and lured to his flat were not assaulted in any manner, although he attempted to strangle a 19-year-old student named Paul Nobbs on 23 November 1981. In March 1982, Nilsen encountered a 23-year-old named John Howlett as he (Nilsen) drank in a pub located close to Leicester Square. Howlett was lured to Nilsen's flat on the promise of continuing drinking with Nilsen. At Cranley Gardens, both Nilsen and Howlett drank as they watched a film, before Howlett walked into Nilsen's front room and fell asleep in the bed (which was located in the front room at this time). One hour later, Nilsen unsuccessfully attempted to rouse Howlett, then {{sat on the edge of}} the bed drinking rum as <b>he</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> Howlett, before deciding to kill him. Following a ferocious struggle (in which Howlett himself attempted to strangle his attacker), Nilsen strangled Howlett into unconsciousness with an upholstery strap before returning to his living room, shaking from the [...] "stress of the struggle" [...] in which he had believed he would be overpowered. On three occasions over the following ten minutes, Nilsen unsuccessfully attempted to kill this victim after noting he had resumed breathing, before deciding to fill his bathtub with water and drown him.|$|E
