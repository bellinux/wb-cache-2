5|$|Asked {{what impact}} {{the money would}} have on him, Kinsler said: I'm {{going to play the}} same {{regardless}} of whether I'm making five dollars or $1 trillion. It really doesn't make a difference to me. I'm going to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> play hard, and money doesn't bring respect. The way you play the game brings respect. When I finish playing the game, it's not how much money I made {{that is going to be}} my legacy. It's how I played the game, and what I did on the field.|$|E

Kinsler said: The crowd was full; I had the {{butterflies}} going, so to get that hit was huge. The family was in town.... To <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> face {{one of the best}} pitchers of all time, you've got to be locked in. It's your first game, your first big league experience—it was unbelievable to face that guy.|$|E
25|$|More {{than just}} the band's image was changing, however. In 1988, Pantera {{released}} its first album with Anselmo, titled Power Metal. Power Metal, like Pantera’s previous three albums, was released on Metal Magic Records, but showcased a change in their sound. By far the band’s heaviest album at this point, Power Metal was a mix of 1980s hard rock and thrash metal, sometimes blending both styles in a single song. Complementing the band’s new sonic approach were Anselmo’s harder-edged vocals compared to those of Terrence Lee. After the release of Power Metal, the band members decided to seriously reconsider their glam metal image and sound. Referring to the band's spandex appearance, Vinnie Paul remarked at a band meeting that “These magic clothes don't play music; we do. Let’s just <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> be comfortable — jeans, t-shirt, whatever—and see where it goes.” The band members would later ignore their independent releases, including Power Metal, as they sculpted a new, heavier image to accompany their later groove metal sound. Their four independent albums are not listed on the band’s official website and have become hard-to-find collector’s items.|$|E

500|$|Madonna's {{version of}} the song begins {{with the sound of}} {{acoustic}} guitars and synth strings. Madonna's voice sounds high-pitched, eluding the deeper resonance of the tune. After the first verse, Tony Thompson starts playing the drums, which moves along the rhythm of the song. Towards the end, Madonna sings the song like a soul singer and the song ends with a gasp of breath. The song was recorded at Power Station Studio in Manhattan, New York. Rodgers recalled: [...] "Madonna had never performed with a live orchestra before. I was very much into doing everything live, so I just said, 'Madonna, you <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> sing and we will follow you.' At first Madonna was hesitant, but the live setting ended up producing memorable results. She sang and she was overcome with emotions and she started crying, but I left it on the record." ...|$|E
500|$|Mets players reacted quickly; David Wright replied, [...] "To each his own. He's {{obviously}} biased in his e-mails or letters.

[...] This response came a day after Myers defeated the Mets 3–0, throwing eight shutout innings and striking out ten. The Mets won the season series 11–7.|$|R
5000|$|Following the fight, Tate stated, [...] "I think I'm not {{in reality}} quite yet. I can't believe that I have a belt {{to take home}} with me.

500|$|... "Marry the Night" [...] {{was written}} by Lady Gaga and Fernando Garibay while {{on the road for}} The Monster Ball Tour, and was {{produced}} by both. It was first mentioned by Gaga as a track from her album, Born This Way, Ryan Seacrest's radio show, where she described it as one of her favorite songs from the album. Gaga and Garibay had worked previously on the song [...] "Dance in the Dark" [...] (2009), from Gaga's previous release, The Fame Monster. Before starting work on [...] "Marry the Night", Gaga listened to [...] "Dance in the Dark" [...] and decided she wanted to top that song's energy with her new collaboration with Garibay. [...] "I remember being backstage and hearing the concert start, so I <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> hear 'Dance in the Dark' open up the whole concert, and I wanted to outdo that feeling.

500|$|Immediately {{after the}} Fiesta Bowl {{bypassed}} Virginia Tech {{in favor of}} lower-ranked Notre Dame, protests from Tech fans and opponents of the BCS system erupted. Some said the selection was [...] "unfair", that Virginia Tech was [...] "hosed", or that the pick of Notre Dame was a [...] "snub" [...] of the Hokies. In an interview immediately after the selection, Vick said the Gator Bowl bid provided motivation to win the Gator Bowl. [...] "We're going to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> make a statement, play a great game and show the nation", he said. Clemson, on the other hand, was enthusiastic about the Gator Bowl bid. A win in the game {{would have given the}} Tigers their first 10-win season since 1990, and the Gator Bowl appearance marked a continued improvement over its showing the previous year. Clemson players viewed the game as a reward for a successful season, while Virginia Tech players perceived it from a more workmanlike point of view.|$|E
500|$|Anderson {{opened his}} senior stint on November 23, 2004 with 14 points, 3 assists, and 5 steals against Birmingham–Southern. In his next {{appearance}} vs. Yale, despite scoring only six points, he posted a career-high 13 rebounds. Teammate Stéphane Lasme added 10 boards. Lappas said, [...] "What {{else do you}} say about Anthony Anderson? He had thirteen rebounds in the game. Its great to see Anthony have six points in the game and win. We couldn't have one a game like this in a million years with Anthony Anderson only scoring six points. You don't even notice it now, where when he didn't score before we almost didn't have a chance. It's good for him to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> play and direct these kids that he has out there under him."

500|$|In [...] "Over and Over", Madonna sings about {{determination}} and picking yourself up from disappointments. The song consists of instrumentation from drums, synths {{and has a}} three-chord progression. An emotional moment occurred in the recording studio when Madonna covered the 1978 Rose Royce song [...] "Love Don't Live Here Anymore". Rodgers recalled: [...] "Madonna had never performed with a live orchestra before. I was very much into doing everything live, so I just said, 'Madonna, you <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> sing and we will follow you.' At first Madonna was hesitant, but the live setting ended up producing memorable results. She sang and she was overcome with emotions and she started crying, but I left it on the record."

500|$|... "Quick Sand" [...] is a {{shuffling}} rock {{song that}} addresses the plight of illegal immigrants to Arizona. It depicts six migrants travelling through extreme climates in the Sonoran Desert to reach Devil's Highway {{in an attempt to}} cross the Mexico – United States border. They journey from Tamaulipas and through the mountains along Devil's Highway. Partway into the journey, the migrants are abandoned by their coyote guide and subsequently lose one another one by one. They experience thirst, hunger, injury, and fear, culminating with the only two surviving migrants being turned away by a vigilante at the border. Cooder said of the route's background and the narrative in an interview, [...] "t's been a migrant trail for 200 years. People <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> try to do it on foot, but if you make one mistake and go five minutes out of your way, you become disorientated and dehydrated. And they find these mummified bodies out there. The heat has just baked them through. And the people who live through it often refer to having a vision of the Virgin of Guadalupe flying overhead. This is a very common vision when the dehydration sets in." ...|$|E
500|$|During production, Benson felt one {{recording}} {{session with}} Lacey Mosley of Flyleaf {{went beyond the}} ordinary {{to the point where}} he left the recording room and told Powell [...] "You have to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> you and her do this because you're coming to God right now in front of my eyes. You guys handle it". According to Benson, both he and Mosley were moved to tears by the session and Benson felt that something like that does not happen often in a recording studio. In a separate session with Mosley, bassist Tai Anderson said that, after recording the end of the song [...] "Run to You", Mosley said she could not believe she was recording with the band. Concerned that Mosley might have been pressured by her management team into doing the collaboration, Anderson said they told Mosley that she didn't have to do the recording. Mosley assuaged their concerns by telling the band that she was actually excited to be able to perform on their album as the band's music had helped her during a difficult period in her teenage years.|$|E

500|$|In a game {{in which}} Penn State {{dominated}} the line of scrimmage, the Nittany Lions rushed for 289 yards behind an offensive line that opened up significant holes, allowing Penn State to achieve their goal of rushing the football, despite not achieving offensive tackle Garry Gilliam's goal of 400 yards. Purdue's coach Darrell Hazell had opined earlier in the week that Penn State's offensive line was not as good as previous opponents Wisconsin and Iowa, and Penn State used it as motivation, dominating the line of scrimmage, which numerous offensive lineman noted was [...] "fun". Starting center Ty Howle, who noted,"It's fun, knowing you can <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> impose your will each play. It's a lot of fun." [...] and all-conference guard John Urschel, who agreed, saying, [...] "This was a real fun game for us, with respect to coming off the ball and just hitting guys. The offensive linemen really enjoyed it. We were having a blast. When you're an offensive lineman and you're getting yards, you want to run the ball over and over again." [...] Allen Robinson caught his 78th pass of the season with his fifth catch of the game, and in doing so topped his 77 catches from the 2012 season. Aside from offensive accomplishments, the defense was also impressive, particularly play from Jordan Lucas, who ESPN commented earlier in the week plays with [...] "swagger", and who, during the game, intercepted a pass, garnering a comment from The Patriot News that he is the [...] "top playmaker in the secondary". Despite jubilation from the victory, including one Penn State player who quipped that the sixth win made Penn State bowl eligible (the NCAA banned Penn State from bowl participation as part of sanctions imposed in the Penn State child sex abuse scandal), seniors nostalgically remembered this was their second-to-last game at Beaver Stadium. The Lions bounced back from their previous loss against Minnesota, and had not lost two consecutive games under Bill O'Brien since their first two in 2012.|$|E
500|$|Across {{all three}} formats, Trescothick took 2,518 runs for his county. ESPNcricinfo's George Dobell noted in their end of season {{round-up}} that [...] "He continues to dominate county attacks {{in a way}} that only Graeme Hick and Mark Ramprakash – of recent batsmen – could match. There are times when he makes the bowlers' job appear impossible." [...] However, as 2012 – Trescothick's 19th season at Somerset – approached, there was talk of resting him from the newly formed one-day cricket championship that following year. Trescothick did not travel {{with the rest of the}} side to the Champions League T20 in India. He missed part of the 2012 domestic season due to an ankle injury, and struggled for form going seven four-day matches without a half-century until passing fifty against Sussex in August and going on to score a century. By the end of the season he had played only five one day games, scoring 118 runs at 39.33, two T20 matches making only 31 runs in total, and nine County Championship games in which he scored 506 runs at 38.92, including two centuries. This was his lowest home-season aggregate since 1995. He nevertheless made a statement to the media voicing his wish to continue playing into his forties, and took up a winter commentary stint with Sky Sports to cover England's tour of India. The 2013 season, however, found Trescothick averaging only in the mid-twenties, and failed to score a century for the first time since 1998. He remained, however, the second-highest run maker for Somerset, behind only Nick Compton, and retained the captaincy for the 2014 season. He continued to appear as a commentator and analyst for Sky Sports in the off-season, in particular during coverage of the 2014 World T20. He also publicly lent his support to England's Jonathan Trott during the latter's departure from the 2013–14 Ashes series, empathising with Trott's stress-related illness in a statement to Sky Sports which recalled his own experiences, recalling that [...] "you just can't take any more, you just can't get through the day let alone <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> play a Test match and win a Test match." ...|$|E
