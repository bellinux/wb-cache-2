25|$|Between 1995 and 1997, the ringgit was trading as a <b>free</b> <b>float</b> {{currency}} {{at around}} 2.50 to the US dollar, but following {{the onset of}} the 1997 East Asian financial crisis, the ringgit witnessed major dips to under 3.80 to the dollar by the end of 1997 as a result of capital flight. During the first half of 1998, the currency fluctuated between 3.80 and 4.40 to the dollar, before Bank Negara Malaysia moved to peg the ringgit to the US dollar in September 1998, maintaining its 3.80 to the dollar value for almost seven years while remaining floated against other currencies. In addition, the ringgit was designated non-tradeable outside of Malaysia in 1998 to stem the flow of money out of the country.|$|E

40|$|Globulettes {{are small}} (radii < 10 kAU) dark dust clouds, seen against the {{background}} of bright nebulae. A majority of the objects have planetary mass. These objects may be a source of brown dwarfs and <b>free</b> <b>floating</b> planetary mass objects in the galaxy. In this paper we investigate how many globulettes could have formed in the Milky Way and how they could contribute to the total population of <b>free</b> <b>floating</b> planets. In order to do that we examine H-alpha images of 27 H II regions. In these images, we find 778 globulettes. We find that a conservative value of the number of globulettes formed is 5. 7 × 10 ^ 10. If 10 % of the globulettes form <b>free</b> <b>floating</b> planets then they have contributed with 5. 7 × 10 ^ 9 <b>free</b> <b>floating</b> planets in the Milky Way. A less conservative number of globulettes would mean that the globulettes could contribute 2. 0 × 10 ^ 10 <b>free</b> <b>floating</b> planets. Thus the globulettes could represent a non-negligible source of <b>free</b> <b>floating</b> planets in the Milky Way. Comment: 11 pages, 3 figures, submitted to Astrophysics and Space Scienc...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a modelling and simulation of <b>free</b> <b>floating</b> pig {{to determine the}} flow parameters to avoid pig stalling in pigging operation. A <b>free</b> <b>floating</b> spherical shaped pig was design and equipped with necessary sensors to detect leak along the pipeline. The <b>free</b> <b>floating</b> pig does not have internal or external power supply to navigate through the pipeline. Instead, it is being driven by the flowing medium. In order to avoid stalling of the pig, {{it is essential to}} conduct simulation to determine the necessary flow parameters for different inclination angles. Accordingly, a pipeline section with inclination of 0 °, 15 °, 30 °, 45 °, 60 °, 75 °, and 90 ° were modelled and simulated using ANSYS FLUENT 15. 0 with water and oil as working medium. For each case, the minimum velocity required to propel the <b>free</b> <b>floating</b> pig through the inclination were determined. In addition, the trajectory of the <b>free</b> <b>floating</b> pig has been visualized in the simulation...|$|R

2500|$|The Russian {{central bank}} {{announced}} plans in 2013 to <b>free</b> <b>float</b> the Russian ruble in 2015. According to a stress test {{conducted by the}} central bank Russian financial system {{would be able to}} handle a currency decline of 25%–30% without major central bank interference. However, the Russian economy began stagnating in late 2013 and in combination with the War in Donbass is in danger of entering stagflation, slow growth and high inflation. The recent decline in the Russian ruble has increased the costs for [...] Russian companies to make interest payments on debt issued in U.S. dollar or other foreign currencies that have strengthened against the ruble; thus it costs Russian companies more of their ruble-denominated revenue to repay their debt holders in dollars or other foreign currencies. As of March 2016, the ruble was devalued more than 50 percent since July 2014. Moreover, after bringing inflation down to 3.6% in 2012, the lowest rate since gaining independence from the Soviet Union, inflation in Russia jumped to nearly 7.5% in 2014, causing the central bank to increase its lending rate to 8% from 5.5% in 2013. In an October 2014 article in Bloomberg Business Week, it was reported that Russia had significantly started shifting its economy towards China in response to increasing financial tensions following its annexation of Crimea and subsequent Western economic sanctions.|$|E

The {{market cap}} used to {{calculate}} the weighting of each constituent is multiplied by a <b>free</b> <b>float</b> factor (ranging from 0.1 to 1) depending on the fraction of shares not subject to block ownership. Any company with 50% or more of its shares considered <b>free</b> <b>float</b> is given a <b>free</b> <b>float</b> factor of 1.
