So we (meaning the team I introduced above) have put together a new section of this website where we can all pool our knowledge and experiences and drunken mishaps into one highly accessible and fun place.|$|E
25|$|I'm {{just happy}} to be here. I think being a young artist, just {{starting}} out of high school, what kids listen to is club music. We don't necessarily get too deep or sing like Aretha Franklin. That's not even what music is truly about today. It's sad, but when I want to give a little bit of sex, being fabulous or sassy. I definitely {{want to be able to}} sing and back that up, and being a dancer first <b>has</b> <b>sort</b> of given me a complex that I have to be able to sing, period, with a band. If I break my leg, I'd like to give a show without pyrotechnics and choreography every five seconds.|$|E

There's a lot of weird stuff in there and when you take that and you add this angry, domineering kind of a father figure, which is Gramps, and you add that he <b>has</b> <b>sort</b> of separated them off from other people, other families and driven them to achieve a lot, and he was kind of a charismatic guy, and still is up to a point.

500|$|Although he {{had done}} {{research}} on pandemics six {{months prior to the}} 2009 flu pandemic, the outbreak was [...] "really helpful" [...] to his studies, because it provided a glimpse of the societal apparatus following the onset stages of a pandemic. To him, it was not solely the virus itself that one had to be concerned about, but how society handles the situation. [...] "I saw them come to life", Burns said, [...] "and I saw issues about, 'Well, do you close the schools and if you close the schools, then who stays home with the kids? And will everyone keep their kids at home?' Things happening online, which is where the Jude Law character came from, that there's going to be information that comes out online where people want to be ahead of the curve, so some people will write things about anti-virals or different treatment protocols, and so there's always going to be an information and that information also <b>has</b> <b>sort</b> of a viral pulse." ...|$|E
500|$|Thematically, {{although}} the series focused heavily on alien abduction lore, {{the decision was}} made early on to allow the plots of individual episodes to branch out into different territories in order to prevent the overarching plot from running out of momentum, which led to standalone episodes such as [...] "Squeeze" [...] being developed. The variety of storylines which the series has shown has led director Daniel Sackheim to note that [...] "The X-Files <b>has</b> <b>sort</b> of found its own style in that it doesn't have a confined style to it", adding that the series' [...] "fluid" [...] approach has meant that [...] "everybody who comes on the show attempt to make a little scary movie". To this end, several episodes feature varying plots, with alien-influenced storylines varying between [...] "Ice", a [...] "briskly-paced" [...] episode set in a single location, and the character-driven [...] "Conduit", which served to fill in background on the characters. Elsewhere, plots focused on soul transference or reincarnation, with the episodes [...] "Shadows", [...] "Born Again" [...] and [...] "Lazarus" [...] sharing similar storylines. The [...] "tired" [...] plot of [...] "Ghost in the Machine" [...] featured a malevolent artificial intelligence; while [...] "Shapes" [...] introduced the first of what would become several Native American-themed episodes.|$|E

500|$|In {{collaboration}} with composer David Julyan, Nolan's films featured slow and atmospheric scores with minimalistic expressions and ambient textures. In the mid-2000s, starting with Batman Begins, Nolan {{began working with}} Hans Zimmer, {{who is known for}} integrating electronic music with traditional orchestral arrangements. With Zimmer, the soundscape in Nolan's films evolved into becoming increasingly more lush, kinetic and experimental. An example of this is the main theme from Inception, which is derived from a slowed down version of Edith Piaf's song Non, je ne regrette rien. For 2014's Interstellar, Zimmer and Nolan wanted to move in a new direction: [...] "The textures, the music, and the sounds, and the thing we sort of created <b>has</b> <b>sort</b> of seeped into other people's movies a bit, so it's time to reinvent." [...] The score for Dunkirk (2017) was written to accommodate the auditory illusion of a Shepard tone, as well as being based on a recording of Nolan's own pocket watch, which he sent to Zimmer to be synthesised. Responding to some criticism over his [...] "experimental" [...] sound mix for Interstellar, Nolan said, [...] "I've always loved films that approach sound in an impressionistic way and that is an unusual approach for a mainstream blockbuster ... I don't agree with the idea that you can only achieve clarity through dialogue. Clarity of story, clarity of emotions — I try to achieve that in a very layered way using all the different things at my disposal — picture and sound." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2008, Thomas told Entertainment Weekly that [...] "I thought I had {{the idea}} broken, but I've hit a wall in the final act that I haven't quite figured out". Thomas {{explained}} {{that he had been}} very busy writing for Cupid and Party Down, both of which he created. In January 2009, TV Guide reported that the film was Thomas' first priority after Cupid. Thomas noted that as well as writing the script, someone would need to pay for the film, but indicated that producer Joel Silver was ready to green-light the film. In June 2009, Bell said [...] "I don't think it will ever happen, and here's why: [...] Rob Thomas and I had a powwow, and we were both 100 percent on board. We took our proposal to Warner Bros. and Joel Silver told us that there is no enthusiasm [...] to make a Veronica Mars movie, and that is unfortunately a roadblock we cannot compete with." [...] At the 2010 TCA Winter Press Tour, Rob Thomas stated that the movie wouldn't be happening, [...] "I would write it if anyone would finance it. If anyone's interested in making that movie I am available, Kristen's [...] available. I would love to do it. I think the closest we came was Joel [...] pushing it at Warner Bros. and they didn't bite. It <b>has</b> <b>sort</b> of gone away." [...] In April 2010, Thomas insisted, [...] "it's not dead. I continue to want to do it [...] We're still looking into it." [...] In June 2010, Silver was less optimistic about the film happening; [...] "we analyzed all these areas about it. I talked to the home video people, because a movie like that would be driven by video. The [...] didn't do that well... So they didn't feel there was a need or an audience." ...|$|E

Was it opera, or was it simply an ambitious Broadway musical? 'It crossed the barriers,' per theater historian Robert Kimball. 'It wasn't a musical work per se, and it wasn't a drama per se – it elicited response from both music and drama critics. But the work <b>has</b> <b>sort</b> of always been outside category." ...|$|E

2500|$|At the time, Bellisario {{said that}} he [...] "kind of [...] what's going on now" [...] {{and that it was}} {{unlikely}} that the relationship would be taken further any time in the immediate future. De Pablo agreed, saying, [...] "I would think if the characters get together, the whole mystery would be done. I {{think it will be a}} lot more fun to play the tension." [...] She elaborated in another interview, [...] "My character <b>has</b> <b>sort</b> of this understated flirtation with Michael's character, Tony. She gets jealous, but I think she would never admit it or hook up with someone in the workplace. He scares her to death. He is the epitome of the American man and all of the things that come out of his mouth are brutally stupid." ...|$|E
2500|$|Composer Hans Zimmer, {{who scored}} Nolan's Batman film trilogy and Inception, also scored Interstellar. Zimmer and Nolan strived {{to develop a}} unique sound for Interstellar. Zimmer said: [...] "The textures, the music, and the sounds, and the thing we sort of created <b>has</b> <b>sort</b> of seeped into other people's movies a bit, so it's time to reinvent. The endless string (ostinatos) need to go by the wayside, the big drums are {{probably}} in the bin." [...] Zimmer also said that Nolan did not provide him a script or any plot details for writing music for the film and instead gave the composer [...] "one page of text" [...] that [...] "had {{more to do with}} [...] story than the plot of the movie". Nolan has stated that he said to Zimmer: [...] "I am going to give you an envelope with a letter in it. One page. It's going to tell you the fable {{at the center of the}} story. You work for one day, then play me what you have written", and that he embraced what Zimmer composed. Zimmer conducted [...] sessions for Interstellar, which was three times more than for Inception. The soundtrack was released on November 18, 2014.|$|E
2500|$|In December, {{developers}} at Sxip Identity began {{discussions with}} the OpenID/Yadis community after announcing {{a shift in the}} development of version 2.0 of its Simple Extensible Identity Protocol (SXIP) to URL-based identities like LID and OpenID. In March 2006, JanRain developed a Simple Registration (SREG) extension for OpenID enabling primitive profile-exchange and in April submitted a proposal to formalize extensions to OpenID. The same month, work had also begun on incorporating full XRI support into OpenID. Around early May, key OpenID developer David Recordon left Six Apart, joining VeriSign to focus more on digital identity and guidance for the OpenID spec. By early June, the major differences between the SXIP 2.0 and OpenID projects were resolved with the agreement to support multiple personas in OpenID by submission of an identity provider URL rather than a full identity URL. With this, as well as the addition of extensions and XRI support underway, OpenID was evolving into a full-fledged digital identity framework, with Recordon proclaiming [...] "We see OpenID as being an umbrella for the framework that encompasses the layers for identifiers, discovery, authentication and a messaging services layer that sits atop and this entire thing <b>has</b> <b>sort</b> of been dubbed 'OpenID 2.0'. [...] " [...] In late July, Sxip began to merge its Digital Identity Exchange (DIX) protocol into OpenID, submitting initial drafts of the OpenID Attribute Exchange (AX) extension in August. Late in 2006, a ZDNet opinion piece made the case for OpenID to users, web site operators and entrepreneurs.|$|E
