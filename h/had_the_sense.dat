500|$|Several reviewers criticized Lone Survivor for {{focusing}} more on its action scenes than on characterization. In {{his review}} for The Star-Ledger, Stephen Whitty wrote, [...] "This {{is the sort}} of bare-bones story that well served plenty of World War II movies once, and it would work here, if Berg <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> to develop these men as characters, first. But we don't really get to know any of them, or what they might bring personally to this life-or-death emergency." [...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday wrote, [...] "The movie seems more concerned with military-style action than with telling us who these fallen heroes really were." ...|$|E
500|$|When Wodehouse {{heard of}} the furore the {{broadcasts}} had caused, he contacted the Foreign Office—through the Swiss embassy in Berlin—to explain his actions, and attempted to return home via neutral countries, but the German authorities refused to let him leave. In Performing Flea, a 1953 collection of letters, Wodehouse wrote, [...] "Of course I ought to have <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> {{to see that it}} was a loony thing to do to use the German radio for even the most harmless stuff, but I didn't. I suppose prison life saps the intellect". The reaction in America was mixed: the left-leaning publication P.M. accused Wodehouse of [...] "play Jeeves to the Nazis", but the Department of War used the interviews as an ideal representation of anti-Nazi propaganda.|$|E
500|$|Gellibrand then {{ordered the}} 48th Battalion, and the 47th Battalion on its right, to {{immediately}} take up {{positions on the}} forward slope of the high ground and push posts forward to the railway embankment below. The forward slope was {{in full view of}} the approaching Germans. The 47th moved forward immediately, came under heavy German shelling, and suffered casualties in moving as far as an old half-completed trench some [...] short of the railway line by 17:00. Leane took the view that Gellibrand did not know the full situation on the ground, and that he had the discretion to follow a course of action that would achieve the objective without unnecessary casualties. He decided not to move his troops forward until dark. Bean remarks on Leane again disobeying orders, but notes that the dangers of such action are mitigated when such subordinates, like Leane, have [...] "outstanding qualities of courage and judgement". He concludes, [...] "ut Leane was Leane, and Gellibrand <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> to know it". Deayton criticises Leane's decision, describing his failure to advise the 47th Battalion of his intentions as [...] "inexcusable", and stating that the serious risk created by Leane's decision could have resulted in a disaster had there been a German attack that afternoon. Deayton also reflects that this was only the latest in a series of clashes between Leane and Gellibrand since the latter had taken over the brigade in November of the previous year.|$|E

500|$|Michael Winner {{visited the}} {{restaurant}} {{a couple of}} days after opening for The Times while dining with Michael Caine. Winner found that the hotel's entrance to the restaurant was still under refurbishment, and that the service was sub par with items being dropped by their waiter. Once the food began to arrive, his opinion changed immediately with a dish of vichyssoise with oysters and caviar showing that White was [...] "on brilliant form". He called his main course of pot roasted pork accompanied by a cuvée vegetables and potatoes with parsley, [...] "as good a main course as I have ever eaten, and I <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> to be born to extremely rich parents, who kept me gloriously fed from childhood." [...] He called the desserts [...] "to die for", and stole Caine's dessert to eat in addition to his own. John Lanchester dined there for The Guardian, on the second night following the opening, but complained of the cost of the meal which he thought at £60 for three courses including cover charge and VAT made it the most expensive in London. He said that the starter of ravioli of seafood with sauce vierge was [...] "good but not dumbfounding", while the lobster salad suffered from the lobster being slightly chewy. He called both main courses [...] "the business"; they were a saddle of rabbit served with a herb risotto, leeks, asparagus and a rosemary au jus; the other course was ham wrapped sweetbreads, he added were [...] "stupendously good", served with braised lettuice and cep confit. He referred to the desserts as [...] "red-fruit heaven".|$|E
2500|$|Despite the stampeding of prisoners, strong senior {{officers}} such as Colonel Harrison C. Hobart <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> {{of mind to}} tie off the flow of escapees before dawn’s light. [...] "The remaining prisoners replaced the bricks at the fireplace, and the guards began their morning routine, unaware that 109 escaped Union officers were making their way toward the Federal lines." [...] Keeping the escape secret from the Confederate guards until the last possible moment gave the evading inmates what they needed most: time. [...] After the morning roll call came up over a hundred short, the Confederates counted frantically several more times {{to ensure that the}} Yankees weren’t pulling a trick. [...] Such [...] "tricks" [...] had occurred on many occasions when men slipped {{in and out of the}} counting lines; this [...] "repeating" [...] was a mild prank often used to frustrate the Confederates at roll call, much to the glee of the Union prisoners.|$|E
2500|$|Hutchinson sums the letter, [...] "The two {{first and}} the last {{sections}} of this advice took away the force of all the others, and the prosecutions went on with more vigor than before." [...] (Reprinting the letter years later in Magnalia, Cotton Mather left out these [...] "two {{first and the}} last" [...] sections.) Major Nathaniel Saltonstall Esq. resigned from the court on or about June 16, presumably dissatisfied with the letter {{and that it had}} not outright barred the admission of spectral evidence. According to Upham, Saltonstall deserves the credit for [...] "being the only public man of his day who <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> or courage to condemn the proceedings, at the start." [...] (chapt. VII) More people were accused, arrested and examined, but now in Salem Town, by former local magistrates John Hathorne, Jonathan Corwin, and Bartholomew Gedney, who had become judges of the Court of Oyer and Terminer. Suspect Roger Toothaker died in prison on June 16, 1692.|$|E

2500|$|He [...] {{played a}} {{dramatic}} role [...] at the celebrated {{meeting of the}} Privy Council [...] on 8 March 1711 when Antoine de Guiscard, a French double agent who was being questioned about his treasonable activities, [...] attempted to assassinate Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford, against whom he had a personal grudge for drastically cutting his allowance, [...] by stabbing him with a penknife (how {{he managed to get}} into the Council room with a weapon remains a mystery). Harley was wounded, but not seriously, due largely {{to the fact that he}} was wearing a heavy brocade waistcoat, in which the knife got stuck. Several Councillors, including [...] Ormonde, stabbed Guiscard in return. Guiscard implored Ormonde to finish the deed, but Ormonde replied that it was not for him to play the hangman. In any case he <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> to see that Guiscard must be kept alive at least long enough to be questioned, although as it turned out Guiscard's wounds were fatal and he died a week later.|$|E
2500|$|In contradistinction to Dover Wilson and Waith, several {{scholars}} {{have argued that}} whilst the speech may not work on the page, it can work in performance. Discussing the Deborah Warner RSC production at The Swan in 1987, which used an unedited text, Stanley Wells argues that Donald Sumpter's delivery of the speech [...] "became a deeply moving attempt to master the facts and thus to overcome the emotional shock of a previously unimagined horror. We <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of a suspension of time, as if the speech represented an articulation, necessarily extended in expression, of a sequence of thoughts and emotions, that might have taken {{no more than a}} second or two to flash through the character's mind, like a bad dream." [...] Also speaking of the Warner production and Sumpter's performance, Alan C. Dessen writes [...] "we observe Marcus, step-by-step, use his logic and Lavinia's reactions to work out what has happened, so that the spectators both see Lavinia directly and see through his eyes and images. In the process the horror of the situation is filtered through a human consciousness in a way difficult to describe but powerful to experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|Former inmate Leon [...] "Whitey" [...] Thompson, {{who worked}} as a guide at Alcatraz for many years and later visited it {{regularly}} before his death in 2005, believed that Alcatraz Island is haunted and has stated that [...] "he could feel it" [...] while he was incarcerated there. [...] He later believed the prison to be [...] "damned", and often <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> of being watched by spirits. During his time in the prison, Thompson was friendly with an inmate named Johnny Haus, a big Texan. He last saw him on 25 October 1962 when he left Alcatraz and knew he'd never see Haus again. One day in the 1980s when Thompson was alone in the cellhouse waiting for visitors to arrive for a tour, he claimed to have seen a large dark figure {{at the end of the}} [...] "Michigan Avenue" [...] corridor. [...] He saw the apparition walk around the corner and out of sight. Thompson rushed to the end of the corridor, but nobody was there. He believed the ghost to be that of Haus, by the way he walked and the feeling which the figure gave off. [...] Afterwards, Thompson said [...] "I don't care what anybody says, that was Johnny Haus".|$|E

2500|$|From 1925 to 1928 he was passionately {{involved}} with Dalí. The friendship with Lorca {{had a strong}} element of mutual passion, but Dalí [...] rejected the erotic advances of the poet. With the success of [...] "Gypsy Ballads", came an estrangement from Dalí and the breakdown of {{a love affair with}} sculptor Emilio Aladrén Perojo. These brought on an increasing depression, a situation exacerbated by his anguish over his homosexuality. He felt he was trapped between the persona of the successful author, which he was forced to maintain in public, and the tortured, authentic self, which he could only acknowledge in private. He also <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> that he was being pigeon-holed as a [...] "gypsy poet". He wrote: [...] "The gypsies are a theme. And nothing more. I could just as well be a poet of sewing needles or hydraulic landscapes. Besides, this gypsyism gives me the appearance of an uncultured, ignorant and primitive poet that you know very well I'm not. I don't want to be typecast". Growing estrangement between García Lorca and his closest friends reached its climax when surrealists Dalí and Luis Buñuel collaborated on their 1929 film Un Chien Andalou (An Andalusian Dog). García Lorca interpreted it, perhaps erroneously, as a vicious attack upon himself. At this time Dalí also met his future wife Gala. Aware of these problems (though not perhaps of their causes), García Lorca's family arranged for him to take a lengthy visit to the United States in 1929–30.|$|E
2500|$|Eschewing Capitol Studios, which Brian {{considered}} inadequate, engineer Chuck Britz often {{collaborated with}} him at Western 3 of United Western Recorders, also serving as a buffer between Brian and the oft-berating Murry whenever he was present. Once Britz assembled a preliminary recording setup, Brian would take over the console, directing the instrumentalists from the booth using an intercom or verbal gestures after supplying them with chord charts that were sometimes written incorrectly. According to some reports, even though Britz was responsible for setting up recording, Brian would then adjust his configuration to a large extent. Asher adds: [...] "As unorganized or even unproductive as he [...] could be in other situations, when he got into a recording session, you <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> he had ideas that were gonna {{get away from him}} if he didn't get 'em done right away. He was willing to have people be relaxed and joke a little bit, but he wanted to get work done. And he sometimes lost his temper just a little bit if Chuck couldn't find a take." [...] At Gold Star Studios, Brian worked mainly with engineers Stan Ross and, with lesser frequency, Larry Levine. Ross said of Brian, [...] " [...] liked the sound Gold Star got on the instrumentation, but he did the voices elsewhere because we were limited to two or three tracks and that wasn't enough for voice overdubbing. ... The tracks were really rhythm pads that would be sweetened after the voices were put on." ...|$|E
