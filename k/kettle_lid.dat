6000|$|We entered, {{taking the}} {{forgotten}} <b>kettle</b> <b>lid.</b> The kitchen was large, but scantily furnished save, indeed, for children. The eldest, {{a girl of}} twelve or so, was standing toasting a piece of bacon with one hand, and holding back her nightdress in the other. As the toast hand got scorched, she transferred the bacon to the other, gave the hot fingers a lick to cool them, and then held back her nightdress again. Her auburn hair hung in heavy coils down her gown. A boy sat on the steel fender, catching the dropping fat {{on a piece of}} bread. [...] "One, two, three, four, five, six drops," [...] and he quickly bit off the tasty corner, and resumed the task with the other hand. When we entered he tried to draw his shirt over his knees, which caused the fat to fall wasted. A fat baby, evidently laid down from the breast, lay kicking on the squab, purple in the face, while another lad was pushing bread and butter into its mouth. The mother swept to the sofa, poked out the bread and butter, pushed her finger into the baby's throat, lifted the child up, punched its back, and was highly relieved when it began to yell. Then she administered a few sound spanks to the naked buttocks of the crammer. He began to howl, but stopped suddenly on seeing us laughing. On the sack-cloth which served as hearth rug sat a beautiful child washing the face of a wooden doll with tea, and wiping it on her nightgown. At the table, an infant in a high chair sat sucking a piece of bacon, till the grease ran down his swarthy arms, oozing through his fingers. An old lad stood in the big arm-chair, whose back was hung with a calf-skin, and was industriously pouring the dregs of the teacups into a basin of milk. The mother whisked away the milk, and made a rush for the urchin, the baby hanging over her arm the while.|$|E
50|$|He is {{just about}} to throw the diary away when he opens it again and reads one more entry dating Saturday, July 4, when Tom and Jerry fought using firecrackers. The scene changes to 1943's The Yankee Doodle Mouse, where Tom throws {{dynamite}} towards Jerry, but Jerry immediately throws it back; the mouse uses reverse psychology to make Tom grab the dynamite for himself, which explodes. Tom then traps Jerry inside a kettle and throws in a stick of dynamite. The mouse escapes as no explosion occurs. The puzzled cat opens the <b>kettle's</b> <b>lid,</b> after which the firecracker goes off, leaving him resembling a blackface sunflower.|$|R
50|$|Tom, now {{wearing a}} bowl as a helmet, throws {{a stick of}} {{dynamite}} towards Jerry, who immediately throws it back to Tom; this continues until Jerry performs reverse psychology by taking it from Tom, provoking the cat to steal it back and this new cycle to continue until Jerry leaves Tom to witlessly hold the stick, which blows up {{as soon as the}} fuse goes off. Jerry jumps into a tea kettle to escape the cat's wrath, but Tom sees him and throws another firecracker into the kettle; Jerry panics, but the oxygen has run out and the mouse escapes through the spout with no explosion. The puzzled cat opens the <b>kettle's</b> <b>lid</b> and sticks his entire head in just as the firecracker goes off, leaving him resembling a blackfaced sunflower.|$|R
5000|$|Requisition for Camp and Garrison Equipage viz: Four camp <b>kettles.</b> 4 ovens, <b>lids</b> and pot hooks, 4 coffee boilers, 15 tin cups. 25 tin plates. 4 mess Bins, 1 coffee mill, 6 spoons, 8 knives. Requisition for forage for 8 horses, [...] of corn.|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on the design of the {{production}} of <b>kettle</b> grill <b>lid</b> from steel 11 305 (1. 0338) with a constant wall thickness of 1 mm and a series of 10 000 pcs/year. For the selected method of manufacture by conventional drawing, technological calculations were performed. Depending on the diameter of the blank, maximum force and other parameters, the tool and the machine were designed. The tool is a single-operation drawing tool with a blank holder and a rib around the perimeter. These functional parts, together with the drawing punch and drawing die, are made of surface-treated cementitious steel 14 220 (1. 7131). The drawing tool is clamped into a CBA 250 hydraulic press with a nominal force of 2 500 kN, where the blank holder is controlled by an additional device {{at the bottom of the}} press...|$|R
5000|$|The {{critical}} Rayleigh number can {{be obtained}} analytically {{for a number of}} different boundary conditions by doing a perturbation analysis on the linearized equations in the stable state. The simplest case is that of two free boundaries, which Lord Rayleigh solved in 1916, obtaining Ra = [...] &pi;4 ≈ 657.51. In the case of a rigid boundary at the bottom and a free boundary at the top (as {{in the case of a}} <b>kettle</b> without a <b>lid),</b> the critical Rayleigh number comes out as Ra = 1,100.65.|$|R
50|$|The Tin Can Band at Broughton, Northamptonshire, a {{seasonal}} custom, {{takes place at}} midnight on the third Sunday in December. The participants march around the village for about an hour, rattling pans, dustbin <b>lids,</b> <b>kettles</b> {{and anything else that}} will make a noise. The council once attempted to stop the tin-canning; participants were summoned and fined, but a dance was organised to raise money to pay the fines and the custom continues. The village is sufficiently proud of its custom for it to feature on the village sign.|$|R

50|$|Fukusa (帛紗). A {{double layer}} silk cloth {{approximately}} 30 cm {{or a little}} less than 12 inches square, with fold on one edge and the other three edges sewn together so the stitching is invisible. It is used for the symbolic cleansing of the tea scoop and tea caddy, and (usually by women) to handle hot <b>kettle</b> or pot <b>lids.</b> The host and assistants at a tea gathering wear the fukusa tucked into the obi. By tradition, the host of a formal tea ceremony uses a new, previously unused fukusa. Fukusa are most often monochromatic and unpatterned, but variations exist. There are different colours for men (usually purple) and women (orange or red), for people of different ages or skill levels, for different ceremonies and for different schools. The size and way of making fukusa was purportedly established by Sen Sōon, Sen Rikyū's second wife.|$|R
40|$|Removing zinc by {{distillation}} {{can leave}} the lead bullion virtually free of zinc and also produces pure zinc crystals. Batch distillation is considered in a hemispherical <b>kettle</b> with water-cooled <b>lid,</b> under high vacuum (50 Pa or less). Sufficient zinc concentration at the evaporating surface is achieved {{by means of a}} mechanical stirrer. The numerical model is based on the multiphysics simulation package PHYSICA. The fluid flow module of the code is used to simulate the action of the stirring impeller and to determine the temperature and concentration fields throughout the liquid volume including the evaporating surface. The rate of zinc evaporation and condensation is then modelled using Langmuir’s equations. Diffusion of the zinc vapour through the residual air in the vacuum gap is also taken into account. Computed results show that the mixing is sufficient and the rate-limiting step of the process is the surface evaporation driven by the difference of the equilibrium vapour pressure and the actual partial pressure of zinc vapour. However, at higher zinc concentrations, the heat transfer through the growing zinc crystal crust towards the cold steel lid may become the limiting factor because the crystallization front may reach the melting point. The computational model can be very useful in optimising the process within its safe limits...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Emergency {{management}} organisations recognise {{the vulnerability}} of infants in emergencies, even in developed countries. However, thus far, those who care for infants have not been provided with detailed information on what emergency preparedness entails. Emergency management authorities should provide those who care for infants with accurate and detailed information on the supplies necessary {{to care for them}} in an emergency, distinguishing between the needs of breastfed infants and the needs of formula fed infants. Those who care for formula fed infants should be provided with detailed information on the supplies necessary for an emergency preparedness kit and with information on how to prepare formula feeds in an emergency. An emergency preparedness kit for exclusively breastfed infants should include 100 nappies and 200 nappy wipes. The contents of an emergency preparedness for formula fed infants will vary depending upon whether ready-to-use liquid infant formula or powdered infant formula is used. If ready-to-use liquid infant formula is used, an emergency kit should include: 56 serves of ready-to-use liquid infant formula, 84 L water, storage container, metal knife, small bowl, 56 feeding bottles and teats/cups, 56 zip-lock plastic bags, 220 paper towels, detergent, 120 antiseptic wipes, 100 nappies and 200 nappy wipes. If powdered infant formula is used, an emergency preparedness kit should include: two 900 g tins powdered infant formula, 170 L drinking water, storage container, large cooking pot with <b>lid,</b> <b>kettle,</b> gas stove, box of matches/lighter, 14 kg liquid petroleum gas, measuring container, metal knife, metal tongs, feeding cup, 300 large sheets paper towel, detergent, 100 nappies and 200 nappy wipes. Great care with regards hygiene should be taken in the preparation of formula feeds. Child protection organisations should ensure that foster carers responsible for infants have the resources necessary to formula feed {{in the event of an}} emergency. Exclusive and continued breastfeeding should be promoted as an emergency preparedness activity by emergency management organisations as well as health authorities. The greater the proportion of infants exclusively breastfed when an emergency occurs, the more resilient the community, and the easier it will be to provide effective aid to the caregivers of formula fed infants. </p...|$|R
