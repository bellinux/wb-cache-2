5|$|After {{dismissing the}} idea of taking Simpson family home videos and a geode, Bart brings Santa's Little Helper to school <b>for</b> <b>show</b> and tell. Even though his show-and-tell {{presentation}} is well received by the class, the dog escapes into the school air ducts to follow the food scent coming from the kitchen and is spotted by Ralph. Groundskeeper Willie is sent after the dog and catches it, but he chooses the wrong vent to exit and the fire department is called in to rescue him. As the firemen are attempting to rescue Willie, an outraged Superintendent Chalmers appears and fires Principal Skinner, much to Bart's shock.|$|E
5|$|Although the Thoroughbred is {{primarily}} bred for racing, the breed {{is also used}} <b>for</b> <b>show</b> jumping and combined training because of its athleticism, and many retired and retrained race horses become fine family riding horses, dressage horses, and youth show horses. The larger horses are sought after for hunter/jumper and dressage competitions, whereas the smaller horses are in demand as polo ponies.|$|E

5|$|Flambeau C (b. 1971) {{became a}} pillar of the French show jumping team in the 1980s. He participated in the 1984 Summer Olympics, where he took 7th individually, and the 1988 Summer Olympics, winning the bronze medal with the French team. The 1980s also saw the rise of Jappeloup (1975–1991), a small black horse with a {{conformation}} and gaits that were considered disadvantageous <b>for</b> <b>show</b> jumping. Despite this, he had an impressive jumping style, and won two French championships in 1982 and 1986, a European championship in 1987, several team medals at the European and World Championships, and a {{gold medal at the}} 1988 Summer Olympics with rider Pierre Durand, Jr.|$|E
5|$|Krusty is a {{favorite}} character {{of several of the}} original writers, many of whom related themselves to him and wanted to write the Krusty-focused episodes. Krusty was used as a chance <b>for</b> <b>show</b> business jokes and thus many of Krusty's experiences and anecdotes are based on real experiences and stories heard by the writers. He was a particular favorite of Brad Bird, who directed the first two Krusty episodes and always tried to animate a scene in every Krusty episode.|$|E

5|$|One Egyptian equestrian {{qualified}} <b>for</b> <b>show</b> jumping for the Olympics. Karim El-Zoghby, {{a veteran}} of the 2008 Games, qualified with his horse Wervel Wind due to his ranking at the 2010 FEI World Equestrian Games. In {{the months leading up to}} the Olympics, he trained full-time in the Netherlands and won a silver medal in the team jumping event at the 2011 Pan Arab Games. In London, Zoghby survived the first qualifying course by finishing joint-53rd with five penalties, but was eliminated after placing 51st in round two with an additional five penalties.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{competitor}} on paper in 1988, Coates {{was supposed to}} only be a coach and was forbidden to compete. The Australian Skating Union had refused to select him as they wanted to allow younger athletes an opportunity to race. However, the AOF officially listed Coates as {{a competitor}} {{so that he could}} train with the others on the ice, and because the artificially inflated athlete count would entitle the Australian team to take more support staff. However, Coates was informed that the registration was only <b>for</b> <b>show</b> and that he was not to race. However, {{when it was time for}} his event, he put on a uniform, defied team orders and skated his best time ever. Henke publicly excoriated Coates in front of the cameras, but stopped when he found out that Prime Minister Bob Hawke had sent Coates a congratulatory message. However, Coates' new Australian record was only good enough for 26th place and ended his sixth and final Olympic campaign. His speed skating teammates Michael Richmond and Danny Kah managed two top 15 finishes each, and Medhurst was the only other Australian to place in the top 20.|$|E

5|$|Robert D'Oyly the younger, Robert D'Oyly the elder's nephew, had {{inherited}} the castle {{by the time}} of the civil war of the Anarchy in the 1140s. After initially supporting King Stephen, Robert declared his support for Empress Matilda, Stephen's cousin and rival for the throne, and in 1141 the Empress marched to Oxford to base her campaign at the castle. Stephen responded by marching from Bristol in the Autumn of 1142, attacking and seizing the town of Oxford and besieging Matilda in the castle. Stephen set up two siege mounds beside the castle, called Jew's Mount and Mount Pelham, on which he placed siege engines, largely <b>for</b> <b>show,</b> and proceeded to wait for Matilda's supplies to run low over the next three months. Stephen would have had difficulty in supplying his men through the winter period, and this decision shows the apparent strength of Oxford Castle at the time.|$|E
5|$|The Butterfly World Tour was {{the third}} concert tour by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey. The tour {{promoted}} Carey's album at the time, Butterfly (1997), and included songs from several of her previous albums. The tour visited Asia, Australia and the United States, with rehearsals taking place in December 1997. Starting on January 11, 1998 the tour spanned five shows in Asia, six in Australia, and one in Hawaii, US. Throughout the tour, Carey varied hairstyles and outfits, as well as song selections. The Butterfly World Tour was very successful; the four dates at Japan's largest stadium, Tokyo Dome, sold out in under one hour, equaling over 200,000 tickets, breaking the previous record she held at the stadium <b>for</b> <b>show</b> sell-outs.|$|E
5|$|The Selle Français is a French sport horse, now {{recognized}} internationally {{as a top}} breed <b>for</b> <b>show</b> jumping and three-day eventing. Selection criteria for breeding stock focuses on their jumping abilities. Show jumping is a technical sport, calling for lively and responsive yet powerful horses. Horses with more Thoroughbred blood in them have also been very competitive in three-day eventing, where speed and stamina are needed {{to be successful in}} all three portions (dressage, three-day eventing and show jumping) of the event. Thanks to these qualities, the Selle Français is seen on international show jumping and three-day eventing teams, both in France and elsewhere. In dressage, the Selle Français has gradually improved, but has faced stiff competition from northern European breeds, which often have more active gaits. In addition, many French breeders guide their horses to the more popular and profitable sport of show jumping, which sometimes deprives the dressage system of good horses. The World Breeding Federation for Sport Horses (WBFSH) ranks warmblood stud books based on their success in eventing, show jumping and dressage. In 2013, the ANSF was ranked as the 3rd best show jumping stud book in the world, topped only by the Dutch Warmblood and Belgian Warmblood breeds, and a Selle Français horse was ranked first in the world. The stud book was ranked at 6th in the world in eventing, with the top horse placed at 25th. The ANSF was ranked 19th in dressage, beaten by many of the more popular dressage breeds, including Dutch Warmbloods, Hanoverians and Westphalians.|$|E

25|$|Dog Clothing is {{a garment}} made by humans for their canine companions. Dog clothes are {{available}} in various price ranges from inexpensive to high-end designer styles. Typically toy and small breed dogs, such as Chihuahuas and Yorkshire Terriers are dressed in dog clothes, although even large breeds like Golden Retrievers can wear clothes, too. It is more common to dress small dogs because they are easier to dress and they often suffer from the cold more due to their coats being less thick. Dog clothes are made to be either functional or <b>for</b> <b>show.</b> Functional dog clothes are for protection from the elements and allergens. Dog clothes that are purely <b>for</b> <b>show</b> would be used as costumes for holidays and special occasions such as Halloween or weddings.|$|E

But if kept artificially clipped <b>for</b> <b>show,</b> or if under stress from age, {{sickness}} or injury, a horse blanket {{may need to be}} added to protect the horse from cold weather. In the summer, access to shade is well-advised.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, the mane is braided on {{the right}} side of the neck. This is still the {{standard}} <b>for</b> <b>show</b> hunters in the United States and eventers, although dressage horses are commonly braided on either side.
