5|$|Mutations that {{disrupt the}} reading frame {{sequence}} by indels (insertions or deletions) of a non-multiple of 3 nucleotide bases {{are known as}} frameshift mutations. These mutations usually result <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> translation from the original, and likely cause a stop codon to be read, which truncates the protein. These mutations may impair the protein's function and are thus rare in in vivo protein-coding sequences. One reason inheritance of frameshift mutations is rare is that, if the protein being translated is essential for growth under the selective pressures the organism faces, absence of a functional protein may cause death before the organism becomes viable. Frameshift mutations may result in severe genetic diseases such as Tay-Sachs disease.|$|E
5|$|One {{year after}} Arthur's death, Henry VII renewed his efforts of sealing a marital {{alliance}} with Spain by arranging for Catherine to marry Arthur's brother Henry, who had by then become Prince of Wales. Arthur's untimely death {{paved the way}} for Henry's accession as Henry VIII in 1509. The potential for a question as to the consummation of Arthur and Catherine's marriage, was much later (and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> political context) exploited by Henry and his court to cast doubt on the validity of Catherine's union with Henry, eventually leading to the separation between the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the mid-1980s}} {{and the first}} decade of the 2000s, the {{prevailing}} interpretation of how hadrosaurids processed their food followed the model put forward in 1984 by David B. Weishampel. He proposed that the structure of the skull permitted motion between bones that resulted in backward and forward motion of the lower jaw, and outward bowing of the tooth-bearing bones of the upper jaw when the mouth was closed. The teeth of the upper jaw would grind against the teeth of the lower jaw like rasps, processing plant material trapped between them. Such a motion would parallel the effects of mastication in mammals, although accomplishing the effects <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> way. Work in the early 2000s has challenged the Weishampel model. A study published in 2008 by Casey Holliday and Lawrence Witmer found that ornithopods like Edmontosaurus lacked the types of skull joints seen in those modern animals that are known to have kinetic skulls (skulls that permit motion between their constituent bones), such as squamates and birds. They proposed that joints that had been interpreted as permitting movement in dinosaur skulls were actually cartilaginous growth zones. An important piece of evidence for Weishampel's model is the orientation of scratches on the teeth, showing the direction of jaw action. Other movements could produce similar scratches though, such as movement of the bones of the two halves of the lower jaw. Not all models have been scrutinized under present techniques. Vincent Williams and colleagues (2009) published additional work on hadrosaurid tooth microwear. They found four classes of scratches on Edmontosaurus teeth. The most common class was interpreted as resulting from an oblique motion, not a simple up-down or front-back motion, which is consistent with the Weishampel model. This motion is thought to have been the primary motion for grinding food. Two scratch classes were interpreted as resulting from forward or backward movement of the jaws. The other class was variable and probably resulted from opening the jaws. The combination of movements is more complex than had been previously predicted.|$|E

25|$|A {{frameshift}} mutation is a mutation caused by insertion or deletion {{of a number}} of nucleotides that is not evenly divisible by three from a DNA sequence. Due to the triplet nature of gene expression by codons, the insertion or deletion can disrupt the reading frame, or the grouping of the codons, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> translation from the original. The earlier in the sequence the deletion or insertion occurs, the more altered the protein produced is.|$|E

25|$|The book series {{does not}} chronicle any one {{particular}} timeframe. Rather, it covers many periods {{in the history}} of Redwall, a world which entails Mossflower woods, surrounding islands, and a land called Southsward. Some of the books focus on characters who, in other volumes, are historical figures (e.g., Martin the Warrior's father, Luke, in The Legend of Luke). Typically, those books are set before the founding of Redwall Abbey. There is a timeline in the Redwall series, but it generally places the books <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> order than the order in which they were written. However, there were two phases when the novels were published in chronological order.|$|E
25|$|Distinct {{from the}} above, a {{full-fledged}} Science Fiction Mystery is {{one which is}} set <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> world from ours, in which the circumstances and motives of the crime committed and {{the identity of the}} detective(s) seeking to solve it are of an essentially science fictional character. An example is Isaac Asimov's The Caves of Steel and its sequels, set in a world thousands of years in the future and presenting the Robot detective R. Daneel Olivaw. An allied genre is the Fantasy Mystery, a detective mystery set in a world of fantasy - such as the Lord Darcy mysteries taking place in a world where magic works, or The Idylls of the Queen set in the mythical King Arthur's court.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile Dona Catarina entered Kandy {{in a grand}} procession.

25|$|A synergie {{was created}} with the {{technical}} activities {{performed in the}} Stanford Rock Fracture Project ("RFP", ran by Stanford University), and the GeoFracNet consortium ("GFN", ran by Montpellier University) {{and supported by the}} company GeoTER. These two projects had overlaps in research objectives though run <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> manner: The RFP tackled questions related to fault and fracture zones in different tectonic regimes but mainly in clastic sedimentary rocks, and was sponsored by a considerable amount of Oil Companies, whereas the GFN was sponsored by only a few companies and focussed on specific genetic relationships in different selected sites. Furthermore, between the three projects there was an overlap in industrial sponsors and stake holders (though Eni was in the privileged position of being the only company involved in all three of them). In this way, the Projects could mutually benefit from the results obtained, and provide suggestions for steering of their relative research activities.|$|E
25|$|His first {{venture into}} etching {{seems to be}} a single self-portrait {{inserted}} into a large print of the ceremonial entry of the new Duke Henri into Nancy in 1610. The established printmaker Friedrich Brentel and his young assistant Matthias Merian—later a major producer of maps and town views—had been brought in to produce a series of prints depicting the funeral of the old Duke Charles in 1608, and the celebrations for the new duke after mourning was complete. Plate 10 of the series shows a large group of mounted courtiers as part of a procession, and it was realized in 1971 that one of the figures, and his horse, is etched <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> style, that can be related to Bellange's other prints. It is now generally agreed that Bellange persuaded Brentel (or vice versa) that he should portray himself. This would have been in 1611, and a bookplate that looks to be an early effort is dated 1613; after that, none of his prints are dated, although most are signed.|$|E
