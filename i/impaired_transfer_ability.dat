40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify the most frequent nursing diagnoses and classify the level of independence for performing activities of daily living in patients with <b>impaired</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>ability,</b> hospitalized in a medical clinic. This descriptive study was performed with quantitative approach, and used two structured instruments to collect data from 63 patients. The collected data were examined based on the diagnosis rationale proposed by Gordon and, later, diagnoses were formulated based on NANDA-I Taxonomy. A total 44 diagnoses were identified. The following diagnoses were present in all patients: impaired walking, impaired physical mobility, risk for infection and risk for falls. The study showed that patients with impaired transfer had a high number of nursing diagnoses and a high dependency level in activities of daily living.

This mapping is learned on training data of seen classes {{and is expected to}} have <b>transfer</b> <b>ability</b> to unseen classes. In this paper, we tackle this problem by exploiting the intrinsic relationship between the semantic space manifold and the <b>transfer</b> <b>ability</b> of visual-semantic mapping. We formalize their connection and cast zero-shot recognition as a joint optimization problem. Motivated by this, we propose a novel framework for zero-shot recognition, which contains dual visual-semantic mapping paths. Our analysis shows this framework can not only apply prior semantic knowledge to infer underlying semantic manifold in the image feature space, but also generate optimized semantic embedding space, which can enhance the <b>transfer</b> <b>ability</b> of the visual-semantic mapping to unseen classes. The proposed method is evaluated for zero-shot recognition on four benchmark datasets, achieving outstanding results.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{is concerned with}} the relation between environmental factors and the <b>ability</b> to <b>transfer.</b> Although many studies in the past have shown that differences in environment result in differences in I. Q., as measured by conventional intelligence tests, there has been less research measuring environmental effects on learning and <b>transfer</b> <b>abilities.</b> The typical approachof studies which deal with either differences in intelligence, or in learning and <b>transfer</b> <b>abilities,</b> has been to select subjects from different environments and, by testing, demonstrate significant differences in the ability in question. Using this method, the results invariably favor subjects from whichever is the "better" environment in the study. The present study treats environment as an independant variable, holding I. Q. constant, and attempts to show differences in <b>transfer</b> <b>ability,</b> the dependent variable, under these conditions. On the basis of the theoretical considerations and empirical results reviewed below, it was hypothesized that, with I. Q. held constant,children raised in a "restricted" environment would show greater facility for transfer than children from a "free" environment. [ [...] . ...|$|R

Hydrophobicity and its <b>transfer</b> <b>ability,</b> hardness, functional groups, microscopic appearance, and thermal stability were analyzed using the static contact angle method, a Shore A durometer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and thermogravimetry (TG), respectively. Some significant conclusions were drawn. After the temperature was cycled between − 25 °C and 70 °C, the hydrophobicity changed modestly, but its <b>transfer</b> <b>ability</b> changed remarkably, which may result from the competition between the formation of more channels for the transfer of low molecular weight (LMW) silicone fluid and the reduction of LMW silicone fluid in the bulk. A hardness analysis and FTIR analysis demonstrated that further cross-linking reactions occurred during the treatment. SEM images showed the changes in roughness of the RTV silicone rubber surfaces.

40|$|Background and purpose: This {{case study}} and {{evidence-based}} analysis aims {{to determine which}} intervention or combination of interventions commonly cited in available research is most effective in facilitating a more efficient, coordinated gait pattern in patients with acute stroke. A stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain is blocked or bursts, causing damage to the brain. Stroke is the second leading global cause of death and accounts for 11 % of deaths worldwide. Stroke {{continues to be a}} major cause of disability and a very common diagnosis seen in physical therapy. It is currently controversial which physical therapy interventions are most effective in the treatment of acute stroke and some therapists continue to use interventions that studies have found to be ineffective. Many studies investigating acute stroke have themselves been found to be underpowered, biased and misleading. Case Description: The patient, Mrs. M, was an 85 year old female who suffered a left cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in late November. She was hospitalized 4 days, admitted to a rehabilitation hospital in early December and to a skilled nursing facility in late December. The patient presented with right hemiparesis, decreased muscle strength, right foot drop, an inefficient, uncoordinated gait pattern, <b>impaired</b> balance and <b>transfer</b> <b>abilities,</b> limited overall mobility and safety, expressive and receptive aphasia, fatigue and confusion. In addition to right hemiparesis, she reported significant left flank pain limiting function of her left side. Outcomes: A review of current literature revealed that a intensive and organized treatment plan including {{some or all of the}} following specific interventions, tailored to each patient’s needs with close monitoring of patient response, can decrease deficits, increase independence and improve overall outcomes for patients with acute stroke. The specific recommended interventions include: therapeutic exercise, task-oriented training, biofeedback, overground/treadmill gait training, balance/transfer training, constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), treatment of shoulder subluxation, electrical stimulation, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), therapeutic ultrasound and acupuncture. Discussion: The overall quality of current research in acute stroke rehabilitation is moderate with many studies demonstrating questionable reliability, validity and generalizability. This analysis focused on higher-level systematic reviews and meta-analyses of current stroke research to determine which intervention or combination of interventions were most effective in acute stroke gait training. This analysis found a general consensus that an intense, individualized combination of the above interventions is most effective, affordable and safe in acute stroke gait training. More high-quality research is needed involving similar stroke patient demographics, research designs, and outcome measures to further investigate intervention effects and to determine consistent, accepted parameters and protocols for optimal acute stroke rehabilitation...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE — Neonates {{of women}} with gestational {{diabetes}} mellitus (GDM) have reduced levels of arachidonic acid (AA) (20 : 4 n- 6) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (22 : 6 n- 3). To assess whether {{this is the result}} of <b>impaired</b> placental <b>transfer</b> or endogenous fetal metabolism, fatty acids in umbilical venous and arterial plasma were analyzed in neonates of GDM women. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Fatty acids were analyzed by gas chromatography in the plasma of 15 subjects with GDM and 30 healthy control subjects undergoing elective cesarean section and in vein and artery cord blood collected separately. RESULTS — The percentages of AA (20 : 4 n- 6), DHA (22 : 6 n- 3), and total n- 6 or n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) as well as total PUFAs were lower in umbilical arterial but not in venous plasma of neonates of the GDM versus the control group. CONCLUSIONS — An altered handling or metabolism of long-chain PUFAs by the fetus rather than <b>impaired</b> placental <b>transfer</b> seems to be responsible for the lower proportion of those fatty acids in the plasma of neonates of GDM mothers. Whereas plasma levels of arachidonic acid (AA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in neonates {{of women with}} type 1 diabetes (1), type 2 diabetes (2), or gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (3) are low, the levels of AA and DHA in GDM women are normal or even enhanced (4) compared with those of healthy control subjects.

40|$|AbstractIt {{has been}} shown that {{cholesterol}} modulates activity of protein kinase C (PKC), and PKC phosphorylates connexin 43 (Cx 43) to regulate its function, respectively. However, it is not known whether cholesterol modulates function of Cx 43 through regulating activity of PKC. In the present study, we demonstrated that cholesterol enrichment reduced the dye <b>transfer</b> <b>ability</b> of Cx 43 in cultured H 9 c 2 cells. Western blot analysis indicated that cholesterol enrichment enhanced the phosphorylated state of Cx 43. Immunofluorescent images showed that cholesterol enrichment made the Cx 43 distribution from condensed to diffused manner in the interface between the cells. In cholesterol enriched cells, PKC antagonists partially restored the dye <b>transfer</b> <b>ability</b> among the cells, downregulated the phosphorylation of Cx 43 and redistributed Cx 43 from the diffused manner to the condensed manner in the cell interface. In addition, reduction of cholesterol level suppressed PKC activity to phosphorylate Cx 43 and restored Cx 43 function in PKC agonist-treated cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that cholesterol enrichment upregulated the phosphorylated state of Cx 43 at Ser 368, while PKC antagonists reversed the effect. Taken together, cholesterol level in the cells plays important roles in regulating Cx 43 function through activation of the PKC signaling pathway...|$|R
