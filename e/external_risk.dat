40|$|In a {{model with}} {{internal}} and <b>external</b> <b>risks</b> together with incentive problems, this paper investigates {{the role of}} a risky environment on contractual incompleteness. We consider a typical employment contract with an extra control option. This option is contractable ex ante, exercisable ex post, and good for incentives. But, the employer may choose not to have it in a contract. We identify some interesting circumstances under which the option is not in the optimal contract. Our main findings are that (1) <b>external</b> <b>risks</b> determine contractual incompleteness, and (2) a complete contract can better handle incentives, while an incomplete contract can better handle <b>external</b> <b>risks.</b> Hence, our analysis of incomplete contracts is somewhat consistent with Williamson’s (1985) idea of low-powered incentives inside the firm and high-powered incentives outside the firm...|$|R

The level of health risk is dependent on duration and the type and strength of irradiation. Penetrating radiation such as gamma rays, X-rays, neutrons or beta particles pose the greatest risk from an external source. Low penetrating radiation such as alpha particles have a low <b>external</b> <b>risk</b> due to the shielding effect of the top layers of skin.

50|$|By contrast, George Reisman {{says that}} time {{preference}} arises {{because of the}} possibility of being less able (say through injury or the effects of aging) or totally unable (through substantial incapacitation or death) to enjoy the use of goods in the future. The further into the future someone considers, the less likely it is that this someone will be able to enjoy the goods {{as much as they can}} be enjoyed now. The root of time-preference in Reisman's view is an internal risk premium that is specific to the owner of the goods, in contrast to an <b>external</b> <b>risk</b> premium that is demanded when the owner invests them in a production process or lends them to another. He then points out that the scarcity of capital combined with the uncertainties he raises, means that time preference is unavoidable and hence a minimum rate of return on that capital (such as in interest and normal profit) is always going to be required by suppliers of capital.|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} of internet banking {{has transformed the}} banking systems across the globe. As a channel to market, internet banking allows geographical constraints to be overcome by offering various products and services at lower customer costs. An understanding of the factors influencing customer adoption of internet banking is both relevant and timely. This study integrates technology acceptance model and perceived risk theory in understanding internet banking acceptance among Indian bank account holders. Specifically, this study categorizes perceived risk as <b>external</b> <b>risk</b> and internal risk, and examines its influence on customer beliefs and adoption of internet banking. Using two-step predictive analytics of structural equation modeling and artificial neural network analysis, the 270 responses reveal that both <b>external</b> <b>risk</b> and internal risk inhibit customer acceptance of internet banking. More importantly, neural network analysis reveals that perceived ease of use and <b>external</b> <b>risk</b> are two important factors determining how well internet banking is accepted by customers.

30|$|It is well {{recognized}} {{that in order}} to combat climate change, GHG emissions need to be managed from the supply chain perspective. This paper moves one more step forward on the base of literature by introducing one concept—supply chain emission trading and one framework in addressing emission trading in the context of supply chains. To implement the supply chain emission trading, this paper proposed to assign the responsibility of supply chain GHG emissions to the focal company in the supply chain by including the scope 3 emissions of the focal company into ETS. Moreover, this paper discerns itself from others by identifying risks for supply chains under emission trading program. From a corporate perspective, these risks are from policy instability, market variation, supply chain agreement dispute, green investment uncertainty, and supply chain GHG emission accounting failure. Moreover, based on the concept of supply chain risks, this paper attributes green investment risks to internal and <b>external</b> <b>risks,</b> policy and market risks to supply chain environmental risks, accounting risks to internal risks, and agreement <b>risks</b> to <b>external</b> <b>risks.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{intends to}} show {{possible}} {{contributions of the}} concept of autonomous cooperation (AC) to enable logistics management of International Supply Networks (ISN) to improve dealing with <b>external</b> <b>risks</b> caused by environmental complexity and dynamics. The concept of AC as one possible approach to cope with <b>external</b> <b>risks</b> of ISN will be analysed either from a theoretical and an empirical point of view. IDENTIFICATION OF MANAGEMENT PROBLEMS IN ISN In the course of globalization, a trend towards the development of ISN can be recognized. This trend can be detected by the tendency of different supply chains to interlink themselves (Hülsmann and Grapp 2005, p. 244) and is associated with the phenomenon of “hyper-linking”. For organizations, hyper-linking connotes that they are interlinked not only with their direct business partners but as well indirectly with other logistic actors (Tapscott 1999) (e. g. its logistic service providers). From the perspective of strategic management, these multiple linkages represent the relevant environment of an organization (e. g. ISN) (Welge and Al-Laham 2003, p. 189) ...|$|R
40|$|Excessive {{levels of}} {{government}} employment {{is one of the}} most frequent complaints made about public-sector governance in developing economies. The explanation typically offered is that governments have used public-sector employment as a tool for generating and redistributing rents. This paper suggests an alternative hypothesis for government employment practices: relatively safe government jobs represent partial insurance against undiversifiable <b>external</b> <b>risk</b> faced by the domestic economy. By providing a larger number of secure' jobs in the public sector, a government can counteract the income and consumption risk faced by the households in the economy. I show that countries that are greatly exposed to <b>external</b> <b>risk</b> have higher {{levels of government}} employment and have experienced faster rates of growth of government consumption. The basic finding on the (partial) correlation between government employment and exposure to <b>external</b> <b>risk</b> is robust against the alternative hypothesis that government employment has been driven by considerations of rent-seeking and rent distribution. ...|$|E

30|$|Elvik et al. [19] {{presented}} {{a summary of}} studies that have attempted to measure the effects of car mass on both the risk of injury {{to people in the}} car and the risk of injury to the counterparts in multivehicle crashes. As expected, the risk to people in a car decreased with the increased weight of the car (approximately 50  % lower risk in cars weighing more than 1, 500  kg than for cars weighing less than 850  kg). However, the risk of cars injuring others increased the heavier the cars are. The <b>external</b> <b>risk</b> of the heaviest cars was found to be about 75  % higher than the <b>external</b> <b>risk</b> of the lightest cars. Finally, the total number of injured persons was almost independent of car mass. These results suggest that the increase in the <b>external</b> <b>risk</b> with increasing weight might offset the gain in internal risk. Tolouei and Titheridge [56] also pointed out that the distribution of mass within the fleet and other fleet characteristics are important factors in determining the relationship between mass and safety performance of vehicles.|$|E
