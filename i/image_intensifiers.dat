25|$|Generation 3 Thin Film {{technology}} is presently {{the standard for}} most <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> used by the US military.|$|E
25|$|<b>Image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> are {{available}} with input diameters of up to 45cm, and a resolution of approximately 2-3 line pairs mm−1.|$|E
25|$|Generation III Filmless {{technology}} {{is still in}} production and use today, but officially, there is no Generation 4 of <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers.</b>|$|E
50|$|Much of {{the success}} and {{longevity}} of the AN/PVS-4 {{was due to the}} MX-9644 <b>Image</b> <b>Intensifier</b> tube. To make the tube more usable with simple optics, a second-generation MCP based <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> was adapted to an electrostatic inverter, similar to a first-generation <b>image</b> <b>intensifier.</b>|$|R
40|$|We are {{developing}} a high precision full-field range imaging system. An integral component in this system is an <b>image</b> <b>intensifier,</b> which is modulated at frequencies up to 100 MHz. The range measurement precision is dictated by the <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> performance, in particular, the achievable modulation frequency, modulation depth, and waveform shape. By characterizing the <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> response, undesirable effects can be observed and quantified {{with regards to the}} consequence on the resulting range measurements, and the optimal operating conditions can be selected to minimize these disturbances. The characterization process utilizes a pulsed laser source to temporally probe the gain of the <b>image</b> <b>intensifier.</b> The laser is pulsed at a repetition rate slightly different to the <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> modulation frequency, producing a continuous phase shift between the two signals. A charge coupled device samples the <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> output, capturing the response over a complete modulation period. Deficiencies in our measured response are clearly identifiable and simple modifications to the configuration of our electrical driver circuit improve the modulation performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the task is to upgrade an existing real-time digital radiography system by replacing an aged <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> tube with an amorphous silicon digital x-ray imager. The real-time digital radiography system at GSFC is currently fitted with <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> tube with a 4 or 2 inch diameter active area with higher resolution at the smaller area. The <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> is exhibiting deterioration in sensitivity associated with extended use and {{is in need of}} replacement...|$|R
25|$|Flat panel {{detectors}} {{are considerably}} {{more expensive to}} purchase and repair than <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers,</b> so their uptake is primarily in specialties that require high-speed imaging, e.g., vascular imaging and cardiac catheterization.|$|E
25|$|<b>Image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> {{have been}} {{introduced}} that increase {{the brightness of the}} screen, so that the patient needs to be exposed to a lower dose of X-rays. Whilst this reduces the risk of ionisation to occur, it does not remove it entirely.|$|E
25|$|Early radiologists would adapt {{their eyes}} to view the dim {{fluoroscopic}} images by sitting in darkened rooms, or by wearing red adaptation goggles. After the development of X-ray <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers,</b> the images were bright enough to see without goggles under normal ambient light.|$|E

30|$|Rather {{than using}} an <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> {{suspended}} over the patient, it is convenient and safe to simply bring a vertically oriented <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> beside the knee, tilt it slightly, and externally rotate the hip with the knee flexed to provide lateral {{views of the}} proximal tibia for guide pin positioning.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] Photron FASTCAM SPECTRA [...] is a 256 x 256 High-speed camera {{coupled with}} an <b>image</b> <b>intensifier.</b> The <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> can shutter to 20 nanoseconds and has a {{spectral}} response between 180 nm to 800 nm. It {{is part of the}} Photron FASTCAM line of cameras, introduced in 1998.|$|R
25|$|First {{generation}} passive devices, introduced {{during the}} Vietnam War, were {{an adaptation of}} earlier active GEN 0 technology, and rely on ambient light instead of an infrared light source. Using an S-20 photocathode, their <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> produce a light amplification of around 1,000×, but are quite bulky and require moonlight to function properly.|$|E
25|$|The {{invention}} of X-ray <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> in the 1950s allowed {{the image on}} the screen to be visible under normal lighting conditions, as well as providing the option of recording the images with a conventional camera. Subsequent improvements included the coupling of, at first, video cameras and, later, digital cameras using image sensors such as charge-coupled devices or active pixel sensors to permit recording of moving images and electronic storage of still images.|$|E
25|$|Also {{known as}} Generation 3 Omni VII and Generation 3+, {{following}} the issues experienced with generation IV technology, Thin Film technology became {{the standard for}} current image intensifier technology. In Thin Film <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers,</b> {{the thickness of the}} film is reduced from around 30 Angstrom (standard) to around 10 Angstrom and the photocathode voltage is lowered. This causes fewer electrons to be stopped than with third generation tubes, while providing the benefits of a filmed tube.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} common terms used for <b>Image</b> <b>Intensifier</b> tubes.|$|R

25|$|Modern <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> {{no longer}} use a {{separate}} fluorescent screen. Instead, a caesium iodide phosphor is deposited {{directly on the}} photocathode of the intensifier tube. On a typical general purpose system, the output image is approximately 105 times brighter than the input image. This brightness gain comprises a flux gain (amplification of photon number) and minification gain (concentration of photons from a large input screen onto a small output screen) each of approximately 100. This level of gain is sufficient that quantum noise, due to {{the limited number of}} X-ray photons, is a significant factor limiting image quality.|$|E
25|$|<b>Image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> convert {{low levels}} of light photons into {{electrons}}, amplify those electrons, and then convert the electrons back into photons of light. Photons from a low-light source enter an objective lens which focuses an image into a photocathode. The photocathode releases electrons via the photoelectric effect as the incoming photons hit it. The electrons are accelerated through a high-voltage potential into a microchannel plate (MCP). Each high-energy electron that strikes the MCP causes the release of many electrons from the MCP in a process called secondary cascaded emission. The MCP is tilted to encourage more electron collisions, thus {{increasing the amount of}} emission of secondary electrons.|$|E
25|$|Auto-gating is {{a feature}} {{found in many}} image {{intensifier}} tubes manufactured for military purposes after 2006, though it {{has been around for}} some time. Autogated tubes gate the image intensifier within so as to control the amount of light that gets through to the microchannel plate. The gating occurs at high frequency and by varying the duty cycle to maintain a constant current draw from the microchannel plate, it is possible to operate the tube during brighter conditions, such as daylight, without damaging the tube or leading to premature failure. Auto-gating of <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> is militarily valuable as it allowed extended operational hours giving enhanced vision during twilight hours while providing better support for soldiers who encounter rapidly changing lighting conditions, such as those assaulting a building.|$|E

25|$|An <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> or <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> tube is {{a vacuum}} tube device for {{increasing}} the intensity of available light in an optical system to allow use under low-light conditions, such as at night, to facilitate visual imaging of low-light processes, such as fluorescence of materials in X-rays or gamma rays (X-ray <b>image</b> <b>intensifier),</b> or for conversion of non-visible light sources, such as near-infrared or short wave infrared to visible. They operate by converting photons of light into electrons, amplifying the electrons (usually with a microchannel plate), and then converting the amplified electrons back into photons for viewing. They are used in devices such as night vision goggles.|$|R
25|$|Second {{generation}} <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> use {{the same}} multialkali photocathode that the first generation tubes used, however by using thicker layers of the same materials, the S25 photocathode was developed, which provides extended red response and reduced blue response, making it more suitable for military applications. It has a typical sensitivity of around 230 µA/lm and a higher quantum efficiency than S20 photocathode material. Oxidation of the cesium to cesium oxide in later versions improved the sensitivity {{in a similar way}} to third generation photocathodes. The same technology that produced the fiber optic bundles that allowed the creation of cascade tubes, allowed, with a slight change in manufacturing, the production of micro-channel plates, or MCPs. The micro-channel plate is a thin glass wafer with a Nichrome electrode on either side across which a large potential difference of up to 1,000 volts is applied.|$|E
25|$|Development {{continued}} in the US as well during the 1930s and mid-1930, the first inverting image intensifier was developed at RCA. This tube used an electrostatic inverter to focus an image from a spherical cathode onto a spherical screen. (The choice of spheres was to reduce off-axial aberrations.) Subsequent development of this technology led directly to the first Generation 0 <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> which were used by the military during World War II to allow vision at night with infrared lighting for both shooting and personal night vision. The first military night vision device were introduced by the German army as early as 1939, developed since 1935. Early night vision devices based on these technologies were used by both sides in World War II. However, the downside of active night vision (when infrared light is used) {{is that it is}} quite obvious to anyone else using the technology.|$|E
2500|$|The {{introduction}} of flat-panel detectors {{allows for the}} replacement of the image intensifier in fluoroscope design. [...] Flat panel detectors offer increased sensitivity to X-rays, and therefore have the potential to reduce patient radiation dose. Temporal resolution is also improved over <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers,</b> reducing motion blurring. Contrast ratio is also improved over image intensifiers: flat-panel detectors are linear over a very wide latitude, whereas <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> have a maximum contrast ratio of about 35:1. Spatial resolution is approximately equal, although an image intensifier operating in 'magnification' mode may be slightly better than a flat panel.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a new {{explicit}} {{model of a}} radioscopic imaging system is presented. The model includes three parts: X-ray projection, <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> and CCD camera. The X-ray projection is modelled as a linear central projection. The <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> is modelled using a new explicit model that considers the curved input screen and the non-linear projection caused by electromagnetic fields. The CCD camera is modelled according to a general 2 D projective transformation of the output screen of the <b>image</b> <b>intensifier.</b> Thus, the back-projection, required for 3 D reconstruction, can be expressed in a closed-form. The model is compared to seven other known models. The presented model achieves high accuracy...|$|R

2500|$|X-ray <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> {{generally}} have radiation-reducing {{systems such as}} pulsed rather than constant radiation, and last image hold, which [...] "freezes" [...] the screen and makes it available for examination without exposing the patient to unnecessary radiation.|$|E
2500|$|Analog {{electronics}} revolutionized fluoroscopy. The {{development of}} the X-ray image intensifier by Westinghouse in the late 1940s in combination with closed circuit TV cameras of the 1950s allowed for brighter pictures and better radiation protection. The red adaptation goggles became obsolete as <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> allowed the light produced by the fluorescent screen to be amplified and made visible in a lighted room. [...] The addition of the camera enabled viewing of the image on a monitor, allowing a radiologist to view the images in a separate room away from the risk of radiation exposure. The commercialization of video tape recorders beginning in 1956 allowed the TV images to be recorded and played back at will.|$|E
2500|$|Fluoroscopy (...) is an imaging {{technique}} that uses X-rays to obtain real-time moving {{images of the}} interior of an object. In its primary application of medical imaging, a fluoroscope (...) allows a physician to see the internal structure and function of a patient, so that the pumping action of the heart or the motion of swallowing, for example, can be watched. This is useful for both diagnosis and therapy and occurs in general radiology, interventional radiology, and image-guided surgery. In its simplest form, a fluoroscope consists of an X-ray source and a fluorescent screen, between which a patient is placed. However, since the 1950s most fluoroscopes have included X-ray <b>image</b> <b>intensifiers</b> and cameras as well, to improve the image's visibility and make it available on a remote display screen. For many decades fluoroscopy tended to produce live pictures that were not recorded, but since the 1960s, as technology improved, recording and playback became the norm.|$|E

2500|$|Electronic Gating (or 'gating') is a {{means by}} which an <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> tube may be {{switched}} ON and OFF in a controlled manner. An electronically gated <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> tube functions like a camera shutter, allowing images to pass through when the electronic [...] "gate" [...] is enabled. The gating durations can be very short (nanoseconds or even picoseconds). [...] This makes gated <b>image</b> <b>intensifier</b> tubes ideal candidates for use in research environments where very short duration events must be photographed. As an example, in order to assist engineers in designing more efficient combustion chambers, gated imaging tubes have been used to record very fast events such as the wavefront of burning fuel in an internal combustion engine.|$|R
