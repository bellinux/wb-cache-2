5|$|Born in West Germany, Wever {{moved to}} the United States as a child, where he took up {{baseball}}. He played baseball {{in high school and}} the University of California, Santa Barbara, which led to him being drafted by the New York Yankees. After four seasons in the minor leagues, Wever made his major league debut on 17 September 1982. In his debut, he suffered a shoulder injury, which <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> pitch through for two years before having surgery in 1984. <b>He</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> come back from the injury in 1985, but retired. After retiring, he opened a bar in San Francisco, which he continues to run.|$|E

5|$|Brassey {{had other}} ideas which were {{ahead of his}} time. <b>He</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> {{interest}} {{the governments of the}} United Kingdom and Europe in the idea of a tunnel under the English Channel but this came to nothing. He also wanted to build a canal through the Isthmus of Darién (now the Isthmus of Panama) but this idea similarly had no success.|$|E

5|$|Eventually, Richard Maibaum {{provided}} the screenplay, {{and at first}} <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> incorporate ideas {{from all of the}} other writers into his script. Maibaum's original script featured an alliance of international terrorists attacking SPECTRE's headquarters and deposing Blofeld, before trying to destroy the world for themselves {{to make way for a}} New World Order. However, this was shelved.|$|E
5|$|Francis Bok waited three years, until 1996, before <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> escape again. During the {{intervening}} three years {{he tended to}} the herds and regained Giemma's trust. Giemma regularly praised Bok's work with the animals yet still forced him {{to live a life}} of slavery.|$|E
5|$|Heraclius entered {{diplomatic}} relations with the Croats and Serbs in the Balkans. <b>He</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> repair the schism in the Christian church {{in regard to the}} Monophysites, by promoting a compromise doctrine called Monothelitism. The Church of the East (commonly called Nestorian) was also involved in the process. Eventually this project of unity was rejected by all sides of the dispute.|$|E

5|$|Hugh Jackman later confessed being {{unhappy with}} the final result of X-Men Origins: Wolverine. The actor wanted {{primarily}} a film that would deepen the Wolverine character, but “somehow the first Wolverine movie ended up looking like the fourth X-Men — just with different characters.” <b>He</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> avert the same results while doing the next solo film for the character, 2013's The Wolverine.|$|E
5|$|Norton {{initially}} made {{a living}} as a businessman, but he lost his fortune investing in Peruvian rice. After he lost a lawsuit in which <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> void his rice contract, Norton's public prominence faded. He reemerged in September 1859, laying claim to the position of Emperor of the United States.|$|E
5|$|The Libellus is a reply by Pope Gregory I to {{questions}} posed by Augustine of Canterbury about certain disciplinary, administrative, and sacral problems he was facing as <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> establish a bishopric amongst the Kentish people following the initial success of the Gregorian mission in 596.|$|E

5|$|After {{a drunken}} and violent fight with Graham in 1938, Scott {{returned}} to Asheville. A group from Zelda's hospital {{had planned to}} go to Cuba, but Zelda had missed the trip. The Fitzgeralds decided to go on their own. The trip was a disaster even by their standards: Scott was beaten up when <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> stop a cockfight {{and returned to the}} United States so intoxicated and exhausted that he was hospitalized. The Fitzgeralds never saw each other again.|$|E
5|$|After {{ten weeks}} being {{constantly}} watched to prevent suicide attempts in police custody, he {{was transferred to}} Akershus Fortress and awaited trial {{as part of the}} legal purge. Despite initially losing weight and suffering from polyneuritis, his strong constitution meant that he soon started working hard on his case with Henrik Bergh, a lawyer with a good track record but largely unsympathetic, at least initially, to Quisling's plight. Bergh did, however, believe Quisling's testimony that <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> act {{in the best interests of}} Norway and decided to use this as a starting point for the defence.|$|E
5|$|After the war Mazurkiewicz was persecuted by the Soviet-led {{communist}} {{authorities of}} the People's Republic of Poland, kept {{for two years}} in pre-trial jail, tortured and sentenced to life, despite the fact that <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> cooperate with the new regime. He was rehabilitated {{after the end of the}} Stalinist period in 1956 and became active in the official veterans' organization Society of Fighters for Freedom and Democracy (ZBoWiD). He was eventually promoted to the rank of general of the Armed Forces of the People's Republic of Poland (LWP). He died shortly before the fall of communism in Eastern Europe.|$|E
50|$|He is the 38-year-old coffee/internet {{shop owner}} in town. <b>He</b> <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> do good and offers his {{help to the}} {{teenagers}} in town {{but he is also}} a local drug dealer and sells dope <b>to</b> them. <b>He</b> <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> help the community by supporting the young people and giving them a safe haven with his coffee shop to hang out and have fun. He grew up in this town and knows how it is to live in the rural area, <b>he</b> <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> give them a place to stay other than hanging out in the streets. He also supports the local disabled group and arranges gatherings for the local youth like his ping pong tournament. Back in the days he used to be friends with Montague Sr. until the accident. Nowadays <b>he</b> <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> loosen the tension between the two families and helps the young couple to sort things out.|$|R

5|$|After {{two weeks}} in Leipzig, before {{the second week of}} January 1793, Kościuszko set off for Paris, where <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> gain French support for the planned {{uprising}} in Poland. He stayed there until summer, but despite the growing revolutionary influence there, the French paid only lip service to the Polish cause, and refused to commit themselves to anything concrete. Kościuszko concluded that the French authorities were not interested in Poland beyond what use it could have for their own cause, and he was increasingly disappointed in the pettiness of the French Revolution—the infighting among different factions, and the growing reign of terror.|$|E
5|$|Although largely {{faithful}} to {{a selection of}} historical facts, the film has drawn criticism for embellishing on events {{in order to increase}} dramatic potential. For example, Prince Albert was never shot during an assassination attempt on Queen Victoria. Fellowes told BBC Radio 4's Film Programme that in actuality the prince did put his body before the queen as protection, and that showing Prince Albert having been grazed by the bullet in the film was added to best show his bravery and devotion as <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> stop Queen Victoria from being shot.|$|E
5|$|As Buxton's trade {{fell into}} decline <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> survive by {{working as a}} botanical {{collector}} and delivering newspapers, but eventually {{had to rely on}} a fund set up by Binney for ‘the relief and encouragement of scientific men in humble life’. This situation was compounded when the proceeds from the second edition of his book, published in 1859, were less than anticipated because of competition from Grindon's Manchester Flora published in the same year.|$|E

50|$|Briefly, Khatami {{is seeking}} for {{a model of}} {{subjectivity}} capable of meeting modern requirements, and convening the privileges of modern subjectivism, but has {{more to say about}} man and its spiritual nature. Regarding this goal, one may organize his endeavour in three steps; first <b>he</b> <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> reevaluate modern subjectivism and ventures to amend it by interpreting the legionnaires of modernity; second, <b>he</b> <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> construe the classic Persian conception of man as an ontetic absolute subject who can be reformulated in modern terms; third, <b>he</b> <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> show a rhezomatic turn in the depth of modern subjectivism toward a neutral spirituality and divinity.|$|R

5|$|As {{in many of}} his {{previous}} pursuits, Burnet set an ambitious agenda for himself but ran into difficulties. He saw the Academy as the peak lobby group {{of the scientific community}} and their main liaison with government and industry. <b>He</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> lift its profile and use it to persuade the political and industrial leadership to invest more in science. He also wanted to use the Academy to increase the involvement of the eminent scientists of Australia in training and motivating the next generation, but these initiatives were not successful {{due to a lack of}} concrete method. Most controversially, <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> change the membership criteria of the Academy. He wanted to stop the Royal Society from operating in Australia and accepting new Australian members. He reasoned that the Australian Academy would not be strong if the Royal Society would be able to compete with it, and he felt that if Australian scientists were allowed to possess membership of the both bodies, the more established Royal Society would make the Australian Academy look poor in comparison. Questions were raised over the existing dual members—such as Burnet—being able to maintain their status and the hypocrisy thereby entailed in Burnet's nationalistic proposal, and it was defeated heavily.|$|E
5|$|At law school, Berg failed Evidence {{and did not}} {{graduate}} with the class of 1929, but he did pass the New York State bar exam. He repeated the evidence course the following year, and on February 26, 1930 received his LL.B. On April 6, during an exhibition game against the Little Rock Travelers, his spikes caught in the soil as <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> change directions and he tore a knee ligament.|$|E
5|$|Back in Europe, Bernard of Clairvaux was humiliated by the defeat. Bernard {{considered}} it {{his duty to}} send an apology to the Pope and it is inserted {{in the second part}} of his Book of Consideration. There he explains how the sins of the crusaders were the cause of their misfortune and failures. When his attempt to call a new crusade failed, <b>he</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> disassociate himself from the fiasco of the Second Crusade altogether. He would die in 1153.|$|E
