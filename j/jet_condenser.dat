2500|$|In Watt's design, {{the cold}} water was {{injected}} only into the condensation chamber. This type of condenser {{is known as a}} <b>jet</b> <b>condenser.</b> The condenser is located in a cold water bath below the cylinder. The volume of water entering the condenser as spray absorbed the latent heat of the steam, and was determined as seven times the volume of [...] the condensed steam.

5000|$|Mechanically speaking, Okanagan was {{of typical}} design. A large boiler {{provided}} the steam necessary to power each engine {{and run the}} on-board dynamo. The boiler itself was coal-fired and, like other boilers of its time, was certified to provide steam pressure up to [...] This steam was transmitted {{to the rear of}} the ship (by means of a bulkhead) where the engines drove the paddle wheel, after which the excess steam would be condensed back to its original liquid state and returned to the boiler by the <b>jet</b> <b>condenser.</b>|$|E
30|$|In this study, the {{dependence}} of PLIF images intensity on oxygen by comparing nitrogen jet with air in supersonic regime was presented. A lower temperature at the exit of the supersonic <b>jet</b> <b>condenses</b> the tracer which in turn forms droplets.|$|R
50|$|The engines {{were quite}} {{remarkable}} for their day. The oscillating engine had slowly developed from low pressure <b>jet</b> <b>condensing</b> {{with all the}} demerits that salt water intake involved, to higher pressure surface condensing that was the forerunner of the turbine circulating system. These were the first high-pressure engines of this type to be adopted by the Steam Packet Company. They worked at a boiler pressure of 90 p.s.i. The stroke was 90 inches with the high-pressure cylinder 65 inches in diameter and the low-pressure cylinder 112 inches. The low-pressure cylinder {{was said to be}} larger and heavier than any other fitted to a paddle steamer.|$|R
5|$|Contrails are a manmade type of cirrus cloud {{formed when}} water vapor from the exhaust of a <b>jet</b> engine <b>condenses</b> on particles, which come {{from either the}} {{surrounding}} air or the exhaust itself, and freezes, leaving behind a visible trail. The exhaust can also trigger the formation of cirrus by providing ice nuclei {{when there is an}} insufficient naturally-occurring supply in the atmosphere. One of the environmental impacts of aviation is that persistent contrails can form into large mats of cirrus, and increased air traffic has been implicated as one possible cause of the increasing frequency and amount of cirrus in Earth's atmosphere.|$|R

50|$|The most {{important}} of these was the 'pickle pot' condenser, a device with the advantages of the separate condenser yet avoiding, barely, the Watt patent. As Watt's patent for the separate condenser ran from 1769 to 1800, these patent-avoiding devices can often be dated to this period: after their invention by Watt, but before the Watt device could simply be copied directly. The Engine also shows evidence of a patched hole {{in the side of the}} cylinder, where the original Newcomen injection valve was removed. The pickle-pot condenser is an extension below the cylinder connected by a large diameter pipe. A <b>jet</b> <b>condenser</b> within this works in the same way as the separate Watt condenser. The Watt condenser is attached by a longer, narrow pipe to the cylinder. By claiming that the pickle pot was an 'extension' of the main cylinder, rather than a separate component, it avoided infringing the Watt patent. A requirement for this was also that the haystack boiler was moved away from its traditional Newcomen position, directly beneath the cylinder. This was an innovation described by John Curr in his The Coal Viewer & Engine Builder's Companion of 1797.|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} on charcoal gasification for power generation {{was conducted on}} a pilot scale of 7. 5 KVA. This experiment used 50 kg mixed charcoal species having moisture content of 6. 9 %, ash content of 2. 5 %, volatile matter of 22. 4 % and calorific value of 6733 cal/g. The product gas was run through gas purifier, <b>jet</b> <b>condenser,</b> cyclone, gas cooler and filter. The gas was composed of carbon monoxide (26 to 31 %), carbon dioxide (3 to 15 %), methane (0 to 1 %) with calorific values ranging from 2600 to 4100 cal/g. The produce gas which was assumed to have been purified of tar and water vapour was fed into a power generator. The electric power generated ranged from 200 to 234 Volts at around 2. 08 A and a revolution of from 1822 to 2110 RPM. It turned out that these gases still contained tar and water vapour which was observed at the engine, {{an indication that the}} gas purifier did not function weel. This is evidenced by the fluctuation of the gas flow rate (from 9. 8 to 1277 Nm 3 /hour). The efficiency of charcoal conversion to electric and heat energy was 11. 7 % and 60 % respectively for a load of 1. 8 KW and 7 hours of operation, and 13, 9 % and 50. 5 % respectively for a load of 2. 8 KW and 7 hours of operation...|$|E
30|$|Regarding {{saturation}} pressures, {{it should}} be noted that R 245 fa, FC 87, HFE 7000, and n-pentane operate at super-atmospheric pressure at 40 °C (condenser temperature). Super-atmospheric operation is profitable for small-scale applications by eliminating infiltration of non-condensable gases. The two main devices that are used to eliminate the non-condensable gases with a cycle operating with sub-atmospheric fluids are steam jet air ejectors (SJAE) and liquid ring vacuum pumps. SJAE use high pressure motive steam to evacuate the non-condensables from the <b>condenser</b> (<b>jet</b> pump). Liquid ring vacuum pumps use a liquid compressant to compress the evacuated non-condensables and then discharge them to the atmosphere[17].|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{approach}} to analysis of cathodoluminescence spectra of substrate-free nanoclusters of argon produced in a supersonic jet expanding into a vacuum. It is employed to analyze intensities of the luminescence bands of neutral and charged excimer complexes (Ar 2) * and (Ar 4 +) * measured for clusters with an average size of 500 to 8900 atoms per cluster and diameters ranging from 32 to 87 Å. Concentration of the <b>jet</b> substance <b>condensed</b> into clusters, which determines the absolute values of the integrated band intensities, is shown to be proportional to the logarithm of the average cluster size. Analysis of reduced intensities of the (Ar 2) * and (Ar 4 +) * bands in the spectra of crystalline clusters with an fcc structure allows us to conclude that emission of the neutral molecules (Ar 2) * comes from within the whole volume of the cluster, while the charged complexes (Ar 4 +) * radiate from its near-surface layers. We find the cluster size range in which the jet is dominated by quasicrystalline clusters with an icosahedral structure and demonstrate that the transition from icosahedral to fcc clusters occurs when the average cluster size is N = 1400 +- 400 atoms per cluster.

40|$|Prior work on {{an engine}} {{combustion}} network Diesel fuel injector led {{to the conclusion that}} under Diesel engine conditions (combustion chamber pressure and temperature) the jet was transitionally supercritical; meaning that the core of the <b>jet</b> would be <b>condensed</b> liquid while the edge of the jet would be supercritical. We report initial experiments aimed at observing the thickened turbulent mixing layer that would result if the jet were transitionally supercritical. We have applied ballistic imaging to the same Diesel fuel injector, under similar conditions, and we find that the images do indicate a structural change when going from subcritical to supercritical conditions. Under subcritical conditions we observe a well-defined liquid/gas interface, surface wave structure, and formation of ligaments and voids. Under supercritical conditions the interface transitions into a continuous, turbulent mixing layer. Images of this layer include the cellular structure characteristic of gas jets. These changes are consistent with experimental literature on cryogenic supercritical jets and with DNS modeling of supercritical mixing layers...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of steam-water direct contact condensation (DCC) was widely investigated {{in the past}} because of conventional and nuclear engineering applications, like in the safety suppression system of BWRs. When steam is injected into a sub cooled water, different condensation regimes can be observed, such as chugging, condensation oscillation, bubbling condensation oscillation etc. (these have been identified during the experimental campaign on condensation of steam injected into water at sub-atmospheric conditions carried out at Lab. B. Guerrini of DICI- University of Pisa). According to the thermal hydraulic conditions of the <b>condensing</b> <b>jet</b> plume, vibrations may arise. This paper so deals with the analysis of vibration phenomena that originate during the steam-water direct contact condensation at sub-atmospheric conditions, not treated till today. Numerical investigations (by proper FEM code) as well as experimental activity will be presented and discussed in order to evaluate if vibrations are capable to jeopardise this safety suppression system, {{which is designed to}} protect Vacuum Vessel of ITER from pressurizing accidents...|$|R
40|$|Direct steam {{injection}} is an efficient means of heating {{a volume of}} liquid. Usually the steam is injected via a nozzle, yielding a strong <b>jet</b> that <b>condenses</b> rapidly and transforms into a self-similar single phase jet. In the experiments reported in this paper, superheated steam is injected, centrally, {{at the bottom of}} a vertical, cylindrical water vessel. The resulting jet is turbulent (Re= 7. 9 × 103 ̆csup 3 ̆e 43 ̆c/sup 3 ̆e- 18. 1 × 103 ̆csup 3 ̆e 43 ̆c/sup 3 ̆e with the length scale based on the width of the jet, r 3 ̆csub 3 ̆e 1 / 23 ̆c/sub 3 ̆e, and the velocity scale based on the centerline velocity, U 3 ̆csub 3 ̆e 03 ̆c/sub 3 ̆e). Using PIV in a vertical plane through the central axis, instantaneous velocity fields have been measured at a rate of 15 Hz. Near the inlet, the jet is mainly steam that rapidly condenses. Further downstream, the jet is essentially single phase, although some residual air is present as microscopically small bubbles. In the area directly downstream of the steam part, the ratio of r 3 ̆csub 3 ̆e 1 / 23 ̆c/sub 3 ̆e to the vessel radius R (32. 5 cm) is about 1 / 14. The production of turbulent kinetic energy has been quantified for the main process conditions. Its dependencies on temperature, nozzle opening and inlet steam pressure have been determined. This production of energy is related to the stresses exerted on small particles in the mixture, and break-up of particles is discussed...|$|R
