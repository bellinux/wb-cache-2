25|$|Supercomputing: DRDO's ANURAG {{developed}} the PACE+ Supercomputer for strategic purposes for supporting its various programmes. The initial version, as detailed in 1995, had the following specifications: The system delivered a sustained performance {{of more than}} 960 Mflops (million floating operations per second) for computational fluid dynamics programmes. Pace-Plus included 32 advanced computing nodes, each with 64 megabytes(MB) of memory that can be expanded up to 256MB and a powerful <b>front-end</b> <b>processor</b> which is a hyperSPARC with a speed of 66/90/100 megahertz (MHz). Besides fluid dynamics, these high-speed computer systems were used {{in areas such as}} vision, medical imaging, signal processing, molecular modeling, neural networks and finite element analysis. The latest variant of the PACE series is the PACE ++, a 128 node parallel processing system. With a <b>front-end</b> <b>processor,</b> it has a distributed memory and message passing system. Under Project Chitra, the DRDO is implementing a system with a computational speed of 2-3 Teraflops utilising commercial off the shelf components and the Open Source Linux Operating System.|$|E

5000|$|Model 4 - {{attached}} to an IBM 1130 minicomputer via the storage access channel (SAC). The 1130 could run {{either as a}} standalone processor or as a <b>front-end</b> <b>processor</b> connected to a remote System/360.|$|E
50|$|The term 37xx {{refers to}} IBM's family of SNA {{communications}} controllers. The 3745 supports {{up to eight}} high-speed T1 circuits, the 3725 is a large-scale node and <b>front-end</b> <b>processor</b> for a host, and the 3720 is a remote node that functions as a concentrator and router.|$|E
50|$|The {{operating}} system supported inter-system communication, job submission and file transfer between CP-6 systems and between CP-6 and CP-V and {{to and from}} IBM and other HASP protocol systems. The system used communications and terminal interfaces through a Honeywell Level 6 minicomputer-based <b>front-end</b> <b>processor.</b> Asynchronous, bisynchronous and TCP/IP communications protocols were supported.|$|E

50|$|In the 1980s, Honeywell's Datanet 8 line of {{communications}} processors, {{often used as}} <b>front-end</b> <b>processors</b> for DPS 8 mainframes, shared many hardware components with DPS 6. Another specialised derivative of the Level 6 was the Honeywell Page Printing System.|$|R
50|$|EXCP {{may also}} be used to access {{communications}} devices attached to IBM 2701, 2702 and 2703 communications controllers and IBM 370x or Amdahl 470x <b>front-end</b> <b>processors</b> (and their respective follow-ons) operating in emulator mode (EP) or partitioned emulator mode (PEP).|$|R
5000|$|The IBM 3720 was a {{communications}} controller (<b>front-end</b> <b>processor)</b> made by IBM, {{suitable for use}} with IBM System/390. The 3720, introduced in 1986, was capable of supporting up to 60 communications lines, and was a smaller version of the 3725. [...] Official service support was withdrawn in 1999 in favour of the IBM 3745.|$|E
50|$|These {{front-end}} processors, usually DEC PDP-8, PDP-11, or LSI-11 based with locally developed custom {{hardware and}} software, {{would act as}} IBM control units attached to the IBM input/output channels {{on one side and}} to modems and phone lines on the other. At the University of Michigan the <b>front-end</b> <b>processor</b> was known as the Data Concentrator (DC). The DC was developed as part of the CONCOMP project by Dave Mills and others and was the first non-IBM device developed for attachment to an IBM I/O Channel. Initially a PDP-8 based system, the DC was upgraded to use PDP-11 hardware and a Remote Data Concentrator (RDC) was developed that used LSI-11 hardware that connected back to a DC over a synchronous data circuit. The University of British Columbia (UBC) developed two PDP-11 based systems: the Host Interface Machine (HIM) and the Network Interface Machine (NIM). The University of Alberta used a PDP-11 based <b>Front-end</b> <b>processor.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{telecommunication}} {{control unit}} (TCU), line control unit, or terminal control unit (although terminal control unit may also refer to a terminal cluster controller) is a <b>Front-end</b> <b>processor</b> for mainframes and some minicomputers which supports attachment {{of one or more}} telecommunication lines. TCUs free processors from handling the data coming in and out of RS-232 ports. The TCU can support multiple terminals, sometimes hundreds. Many of these TCUs can support RS-232 when it is required, although there are other serial interfaces as well.|$|E
50|$|In an ATC centre the RMCDE {{is used as}} a <b>front-end</b> <b>processor</b> (i.e. {{the first}} system to be {{encountered}} by incoming surveillance data). This means that it also acts as a gatekeeper. It therefore has a number of capabilities to protect downstream systems. The surveillance data is checked according to a number of rules set in the ASTERIX standard and corrupted data is immediately discarded. The filter function, both static and dynamic (i.e. depending on load), ensures that downstream systems are not flooded by huge amounts of unnecessary data.|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} component of EPICS (Experimental Physics and Industrial Control System) is iocCore, which is the core software in the IOC (input/output controller) <b>front-end</b> <b>processors.</b> At ICALEPCS 1999 a paper was presented describing plans to port iocCore to multiple operating systems.

50|$|Under the {{leadership}} of Tom O'Rourke, Amdahl entered the IBM-compatible peripherals business in <b>front-end</b> <b>processors</b> and storage products. These products were very successful {{for a number of}} years with the support of Jack Lewis, the former CEO of Amdahl. The reliance upon a single product, within the complex business of mainframes and their equally valuable peripherals, condemned the company's hardware business when market forces shifted to x86-based processors. This had been foreseen, leading to an increasing emphasis on software and consulting services.|$|R
50|$|In a VTAM network, {{communication}} {{took place}} through an integrated communication adapter in the mainframe itself, or by a separate programmable <b>front-end</b> <b>processor,</b> the IBM 3745/3746 Communications Processor, {{with its own}} operating system, the Network Control Program NCP. These machines are no longer actively marketed by IBM, but are still supported. IBM provides hardware maintenance and microcode updates for the estimated 20,000 installed 3745/3746 controllers. A robust third party industry of smaller 3745/3746 specialty companies provide such controllers, upgrades, features, and related support services. VTAM and SNA are still in use by many enterprises.|$|E
50|$|MTS can {{and does}} use {{communication}} controllers {{such as the}} IBM 2703 and the Memorex 1270 to support dial-in terminals and remote batch stations over dial-in and dedicated data circuits, but these controllers proved to be fairly inflexible and unsatisfactory for connecting large numbers of diverse terminals and later personal computers running terminal emulation software at ever higher data rates. Most MTS sites choose {{to build their own}} front-end processors or to use a <b>front-end</b> <b>processor</b> developed by one of the other MTS sites to provide terminal support.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} a UK-based {{time-sharing}} bureau business is OLS Computer Services (UK) Ltd. Previously Leasco Response and later acquired by On-Line Systems of Pittsburgh, PA, the company operated four HP-2000 TSB (Time shared Basic) systems from its Knightsbridge (later Islington) headquarters offering off-the-shelf business packages as well as raw time to universities. In addition to its HP estate a DEC PDP-10 operated as a <b>front-end</b> <b>processor</b> (FEP) connecting UK users to 16 DEC PDP-11s based in the US. Connectivity was provided via leased Westrex ASR 33 or Data Dynamics 390 punched-tape enabled teletype machines connected via Post Office (ex GPO) type 2 modems or acoustic couplers connecting telephone handsets operating at up to 110cps.|$|E
50|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{terminals}} were supported as of 1980, including both EBCDIC-based units using IBM-proprietary protocols, and asynchronous ASCII-based units. Since terminals were connected through various types of <b>front-end</b> <b>processors</b> (as per common IBM timesharing practice both then and now), and could therefore function without CPU attention for {{a considerable amount of}} time, MUSIC used variable-length time slices, which could, on compute-bound processing, reach a maximum of several seconds per time slice; conversely, if a user filled the output buffer or reached a conversational read, the timeslice would end immediately.|$|R
40|$|The NIF Integrated Computer Control System (ICCS) {{application}} software uses {{a set of}} service frameworks that assures uniform behavior spanning the <b>front-end</b> <b>processors</b> (FEPs) and supervisor programs. This uniformity is visible both in the way each program employs shared services and in the flexibility it affords for attaching graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Uniformity of structure across applications is desired {{for the benefit of}} programmers who will be maintaining the many programs that constitute the ICCS. In this paper, the framework components that have the greatest impact on the application structure are discussed. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{gradient-based}} {{family can}} estimate vector motion {{of every single}} pixel, giving a dense representation of the processed frame. There are several examples of video compression using gradient based algorithm [7]. Recursive algorithms belonging to this family {{do not have to}} transmit motion information. Nevertheless, this algorithm family has the drawback of large motion vectors (severe motion), noisy images, and changes in illumination. The present approach is based on a Multichannel Gradient Model (McGM) [8 – 10], a neuromorphic algorithm fitted to allow the construction of viable, highly robust, <b>front-end</b> <b>processors</b> for image recognition systems [11].|$|R
5000|$|Competing with IBM in the {{mainframe}} market, {{the company}} manufactured [...] "plug-compatible" [...] mainframes, shipping its first machine in 1975 — the Amdahl 470V/6, a less expensive, more reliable and faster {{replacement for the}} System 370/168. By purchasing an Amdahl 470 and plug-compatible peripheral devices from third-party manufacturers, customers could now run S/360 and S/370 applications without buying actual IBM hardware. Amdahl's software team developed VM/PE, software designed to optimize the performance of IBM's MVS operating system when running under IBM's VM operating system. By 1979, Amdahl Corporation had sold over a US$1 billion of V6 and V7 mainframes and had over 6,000 employees worldwide. The corporation went on to distribute an IBM-plug-compatible <b>front-end</b> <b>processor</b> (the 4705) as well as high-performance disk drives, both jointly developed with Fujitsu engineers.|$|E
50|$|The {{company was}} founded as CMC, or Computer Machinery Company Limited, on 18 September 1969 by Ray Parry. They were {{originally}} distributors and subsequently manufacturers of key to disk computer systems {{made by the}} US-based Computer Machinery Corporation. The CMC key to disk systems were used by companies and government departments for data capture. In 1976, CMC developed a bit-slice based intelligent terminal—the P99—which it used both as a front end processor to the key to disk systems and as a terminal in its own right. It then evolved the CMC P99 into the P141—a true <b>front-end</b> <b>processor,</b> which it used to implement a new data capture system call Sovereign. This was used in manufacturing companies such as Rolls-Royce plc, British Steel Corporation and various government departments including providing data capture for the DHSS at Newcastle upon Tyne. It later evolved into the M8000 system, based on Intel-processor-based systems.|$|E
5000|$|Written Japanese uses several {{different}} scripts: kanji (Chinese characters), 2 sets of kana (phonetic syllabaries) and roman letters. While kana and roman letters can be typed {{directly into a}} computer, entering kanji is a more complicated process as {{there are far more}} kanji than there are keys on most keyboards. To input kanji on modern computers, the reading of kanji is usually entered first, then an input method editor (IME), also sometimes known as a <b>front-end</b> <b>processor,</b> shows a list of candidate kanji that are a phonetic match, and allows the user to choose the correct kanji. More-advanced IMEs work not by word but by phrase, thus increasing the likelihood of getting the desired characters as the first option presented. Kanji readings inputs can be either via romanization (rōmaji nyūryoku, [...] ) or direct kana input (kana nyūryoku, [...] ). Romaji input is more common on PCs and other full-size keyboards (although direct input is also widely supported), whereas direct kana input is typically used on mobile phones and similar devices - each of the 10 digits (1-9,0) corresponds to one of the 10 columns in the gojūon table of kana, and multiple presses select the row.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A {{response}} time analysis {{for a general}} class of terminals-to-computer subsystem is presented in this paper. The model used {{is based on the}} most advanced data communications system in which terminals are connected to Terminal Control Units (TCU) that are in turn connected to local <b>Front-End</b> <b>Processors</b> (FEP). The line control procedures used to interface a TCU and an FEP may be half-duplex Binary Synchronous Communications (BSC), half-duplex Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC), or full-duplex SDLC. The models presented here can be used to determine bottlenecks in the entire system and to facilitate the initial phase of system design and configuration...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper investigates a novel support vector {{machines}} (SVMs) based {{technique to}} segregate speech segments from the concurrent background. The {{goal of the}} speech segment extraction is to separate the acoustic events of interest in a continuously recorded signal from {{the other parts of}} the signal (background). Speech segment extraction is an essential step in many <b>front-end</b> <b>processors</b> in speech recognition and coding systems and it has a direct effect on their performances. The investigated technique is an on-line process that can classify the speech features on a frame basis. Our SVMs approach is compared with another successful technique based on the hidden Markov model and showed an advantage in detecting the intra-word silence as well the inter-word silence periods. ...|$|R
