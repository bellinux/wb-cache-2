40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the influence of}} biodiesel on the injection, spray, and engine characteristics with the aim to reduce harmful emissions. The considered engine is a bus diesel engine with injection M system. The injection, fuel spray, and engine characteristics, obtained with biodiesel, are compared to those obtained with mineral diesel (D 2) under various operating regimes. The considered fuel is neat biodiesel from rapeseed oil. Its density, viscosity, surface tension, and sound velocity are determined experimentally and compared to those of D 2. The obtained results are {{used to analyze the}} most important injection, fuel spray, and engine characteristics. The injection characteristics are determined numerically under the operating regimes, corresponding to the 13 mode <b>ESC</b> <b>test.</b> The fuel spray is obtained experimentally under peak torque condition. Engine characteristics are determined experimentally under 13 mode <b>ESC</b> <b>test</b> conditions. The results indicate that, by using biodiesel, harmful emissions (NOx, CO, smoke and HC) can be reduced to some extent by adjusting the injection pump timing properly...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{rule-based}} SCR {{control strategy}} is developed for a 5 % biodiesel fueled heavy-diesel engine. The control {{objective is to}} reduce the tail-pipe NOx emission while minimizing the urea dosage in a reliable fashion. A total of 32 <b>runs</b> of experimental <b>test</b> in <b>ESC</b> and ETC driving modes are conducted to demonstrate the performance and reliability of the rule-based control strategy. Average NOx reduction rates of 78. 5 % and 60 % are achieved for the <b>ESC</b> and ETC <b>tests</b> respectively. In the mean time, the average urea dosage is 160 gram for the <b>ESC</b> <b>tests</b> and 0. 49 % of the fuel consumption for the ETC tests. Variation of less than 7. 78 % and 12. 05 % for the <b>ESC</b> and ETC <b>tests</b> respectively demonstrate the reliability of the rule-based control strategy...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{shows the}} results {{obtained}} by drying 38 -mm thick beech timber, namely one control <b>test</b> <b>run</b> under usual, conventional drying schedule and four <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> dried under the same schedule but with oscillations of equilibrium moisture content. During oscillation drying, temperature curve was identical with the temperature curve in the control <b>test</b> <b>run,</b> and the values of equilibrium moisture content oscillated according to previously set amplitudes and frequencies. Oscillation amplitudes were ± 10 % {{in the first two}} <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> and ± 20 % in the second two <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> compared to the value anticipated in the schedule. Duration of each oscillation was 3 h in the first and third <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> and 6 h in the second and fourth <b>test</b> <b>runs.</b> Special addition to the manufacturer’s software was developed for the realization of these oscillations. When comparing the results, drying time (for the same intervals of initial and final timber moisture content), energy consumption and drying quality were taken into consideration. Drying quality was determined {{at the end of each}} <b>test</b> <b>run</b> (both before and after conditioning), and based on the value of final timber moisture content, distribution of moisture content across thickness and gap size. Drying time was shorter in all four <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> with oscillations, and energy consumption was lower than in the conventional <b>test</b> <b>run.</b> Slightly shorter drying period was recorded in <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> with oscillation frequency of 3 hours compared to the <b>test</b> <b>runs</b> with 6 hour oscillations. Final timber moisture content was almost even in all <b>test</b> <b>runs.</b> Profiles of moisture content across timber thickness were also similar in the <b>test</b> <b>runs,</b> but the biggest difference between core and surface at the end of drying was achieved in the <b>test</b> <b>run</b> without oscillations. Before conditioning, average gap value of over 2 mm was recorded in all <b>test</b> <b>runs,</b> but the biggest average value was recorded in the <b>test</b> <b>run</b> without oscillations...|$|R
40|$|The early {{diagnosis}} of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is challenging. Sudomotor dysfunction {{is one of}} the earliest detectable abnormalities in DPN. The present study aimed to determine the diagnostic performance of the electrochemical skin conductance (<b>ESC)</b> <b>test</b> in detecting early DPN, compared with the vibration perception threshold (VPT) test and diabetic neuropathy symptom (DNS) score, using the modified neuropathy disability score (NDS) as the reference standard. Five hundred and twenty-three patients with type 2 diabetes underwent an NDS-based clinical assessment for neuropathy. Participants were classified into the DPN and non-DPN groups based on the NDS (≥ 6). Both groups were evaluated further using the DNS, and VPT and <b>ESC</b> <b>testing.</b> A receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to compare the efficacy of ESC measurements with those of DNS and VPT testing in detecting DPN. The DPN group (n = 110, 21 %) had significantly higher HbA 1 c levels and longer diabetes durations compared with the non-DPN group (n = 413). The sensitivity of feet ESC 15 V, and DNS ≥ 1, were 16. 4, 10. 9 and 1. 8, respectively. ESC measurement is an objective and sensitive technique for the early detection of DPN. Feet ESC measurement was superior to VPT testing for identifying patients with early DPN...|$|R
