50|$|Sadiq is {{an active}} {{supporter}} of initiatives towards improving female participation in ICT. She developed an interactive workshop series, which has been delivered to over a thousand high school students since 2006. The aim of the initiative is to promote interest in ICT related study and professional pursuits especially for female students. The basic rationale behind {{the design of the}} workshops is to demonstrate computing principles and techniques by masking them in various socially relevant applications such as health, <b>forensics,</b> <b>genetics,</b> fashion, movie making, game design, environment modeling etc. Sadiq also gives role model talks; and participates in various girls in ICT events, such as “GIDGITS” and “Technology Takes You Anywhere”.|$|R
50|$|The International Society for <b>Forensic</b> <b>Genetics</b> - ISFG is an {{international}} non-profit scientific society founded in 1968. The main goal of the society is to advance the field of <b>forensic</b> <b>genetics,</b> also termed DNA profiling, through dissemination of scientific results and opinions, communication amongst scientists and education. The bi-annual international ISFG congresses, international workshops and seminars, the society’s highly acclaimed scientific journal (http://www.fsigenetics.com Forensic Science International: Genetics), and the scientific recommendations on current topics all work towards this goal. The society’s website http://www.isfg.org contains up to date information on all activities.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{paper is}} {{specifically}} designed to explain the important scientific points of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology in forensic science and molecular biology. Scientific procedures presented in the paper are complex, simple were {{specifically designed to}} better explain and reinforce the key concepts of PCR. The PCR is a laboratory technique for amplifying a specific sequence of a minute amount of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) even from a single hair root or a microscopic blood stain left at a crime scene. Todays, PCR has found widespread and innumerable uses in <b>forensics,</b> <b>genetics,</b> DNA fingerprinting, bacteriology, virology, cloning and many other areas. Major research areas such as biomarker discovery, gene regulation and cancer research are challenging today’s PCR technologies with more demanding requirements. Reproducibility of data and time to results are still major problems encountered by researchers...|$|R

5000|$|He {{refers to}} himself as a biohacker and {{believes}} in the importance in letting the general public participate in scientific experimentation, rather than leaving it segregated to labs. Zayner found the biohacking community exclusive and hierarchical, particularly {{in the types of}} people who decide what is [...] "safe". He hopes that his projects can let even more people experiment in their homes. Other scientists responded that biohacking is inherently privileged, as it requires leisure time and money, and that deviance from the safety rules of concern would lead to even harsher regulations for all. Zayner's public CRISPR kit campaign coincided with wider scrutiny over genetic modification. Zayner maintained that these fears were based on misunderstandings of the product, as genetic experiments on yeast and bacteria cannot produce a viral epidemic. In April 2015, Zayner ran a hoax on Craigslist to raise awareness about the future potential of forgery in <b>forensics</b> <b>genetics</b> testing.|$|R
40|$|PCR is {{an acronym}} for »polymerase chain reaction«, a {{technique}} based on detection and amplification of specific DNA and RNA sequences. It can be applied in diagnostics of hereditary diseases, <b>forensics,</b> population <b>genetics,</b> systematics, bioengineering, evolution biology, and also aquaculture. With this method {{it is possible to}} diagnose an array of viral, bacterial and parasitic diseases of fish, shellfish and crustaceans. The advantages of the technique are manifested in rapid obtaining of results, high specificity and sensitivity...|$|R

50|$|The International Society for <b>Forensic</b> <b>Genetics</b> - ISFG - {{was founded}} in 1968 in Mainz, Germany, under the name ‘Gesellschaft für forensische Blutgruppenkunde’ (Society for Forensic Haemogenetics). The society was founded as a {{non-profit}} organisation according to German civil law. The original aim of the society was to promote the science of genetic markers in human blood for use in forensic science. In 1989, the society was transformed to an international society (‘International Society for Forensic Haemogenetics - ISFH’). In 1991, based on the transition from traditional serological markers in blood to universal DNA polymorphisms the name was changed into ‘International Society for Forensic Genetics’. Currently the ISFG strives to support all research interests in <b>forensic</b> <b>genetics,</b> also including non-human DNA studies, RNA based test systems, and large scale sequencing technologies.|$|E

40|$|<b>Forensic</b> {{molecular}} <b>genetics</b> {{has been}} {{evolved from a}} rapidly developing field into accepted forensic science, leading DNA databases with DNA profiles from suspects and convicted offenders.

At present, a robust system for DNA typing has been established for paternity testing and forensic stain analysis in criminal casework. In addition, forensic biologist should be aware about the ethical and legal consequences of their research on the society and the criminal justice system.
