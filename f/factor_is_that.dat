5|$|In June 2016, the {{estimated}} cost of the one-stop SSE was revised from $2 billion to $2.9 billion because tunnels need to be deeper than expected in some places, with the new terminal station being 45 to 90 per cent deeper. An additional cost <b>factor</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> a high water table would require more concrete. There is also a $300 million maintenance cost to keep Line 3 Scarborough operating until the SSE's opening {{resulting in a total}} project cost of $3.2 billion.|$|E
5|$|Completed in 1916, the Trans-Siberian connects Moscow with Russian Pacific {{seaports}} such as Vladivostok. From the 1960s {{until the}} early 1990s the railway served as the primary land bridge between Asia and Europe, until several factors caused {{the use of the}} railway for transcontinental freight to dwindle. One <b>factor</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the railways of the former Soviet Union use a wider rail gauge than {{most of the rest of}} Europe as well as China. Recently, however, the Trans-Siberian has regained ground as a viable land route between the two continents.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} factors {{that make it}} {{difficult}} to determine when exactly Hispanics began to serve in the Corps; one is that statistics on Hispanics were not kept by the military until the 1970s when the United States Census Bureau coined the phrase. Before then only unreliable estimates were made. For example, during World War II Hispanic Americans were estimated to comprise 2.3% to 4.7% of the Armed Forces. However, the exact number is unknown, as at the time Hispanics were integrated into the general white population census count. Separate statistics were kept for African Americans and Asian Americans. Another <b>factor</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the estimates which have been made only take into account individuals whose surname is of Hispanic origin, when there are many Hispanics with non-Hispanic surnames who have served.|$|E

5|$|Details on {{the retreat}} of Siberian and Russian Far East glaciers less {{adequate}} {{than in most}} other glaciated areas of the world. There are several reasons for this, the principal one being that {{since the collapse of}} Communism there has been a large {{reduction in the number of}} monitoring stations. Another <b>factor</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> in the Verkhoyansk and Cherskiy Ranges it was thought glaciers were absent before they were discovered during the 1940s, whilst in ultra-remote Kamchatka and Chukotka, although the existence of glaciers was known earlier, monitoring of their size dates back no earlier than the end of World War II. Nonetheless, available records do indicate a general retreat of all glaciers in the Altai Mountains with the exception of volcanic glaciers in Kamchatka. Sakha’s glaciers, totaling seventy square kilometers, have shrunk by around 28percent since 1945 reaching several percent annually in some places, whilst in the Altai and Chukotkan mountains and non-volcanic areas of Kamchatka, the shrinkage is considerably larger.|$|E
5|$|During the state's early history, vetoes were seldom {{employed}} by governors primarily {{because they were}} seen as only symbolic since the General Assembly could override them with only a simple majority. Governor James Whitcomb {{was the first to}} make significant use of the power and vetoed a record of fifteen bills during a single legislative session. Roger Branigin, who presided over a hostile legislature, made the most total vetoes of any governor, returning a total of one hundred bills to the assembly. Despite the fact that vetoes are easily overridden, only around ten percent of vetoed bills are overridden. During the 1970s, for example, 117 bills were vetoed, but only eleven were overridden. Observers and historians attribute this to the short length of legislative sessions, which often do not allow enough time for a large number of bills to pass through both houses twice. Another <b>factor</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> legislators of the same party as the governor typically refuse to override his veto, even in cases where they supported the bill originally.|$|E

50|$|From {{early in}} the morning the strike was seen as a success but two factors led to the {{escalation}} of the events. The first <b>factor</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the British Government in Malta prohibited the officials of the General Workers Union from using the ‘Rediffusion’ (radio station) to inform their members who should or should not go to work. The second <b>factor</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the drivers of the public transport were being intimidated and persuaded to work {{on the day of the}} strike or else they will lose the license to work.|$|R
25|$|A {{secondary}} <b>factor</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the signalling {{technology of}} the time was insufficient to allow detection of two broken rails on the line on which the train was operating.|$|R
25|$|An {{important}} <b>factor</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> families did {{not produce}} a sufficient amount of male descendants. As noble status was inherited patrilineally, the lack of men lead to families’ extinction. A reason is that noblemen as warriors were exposed to greater risks than the population in general and therefore died in a young age and without issue.|$|E
25|$|Slab track {{can also}} {{generate}} significantly more noise pollution and cause more vibration than traditional ballasted track. While {{this is partly}} attributable to slab track's decreased sound absorption qualities, a more significant <b>factor</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> slab track typically uses softer rail fasteners to provide vertical compliance similar to ballasted track, and these can lead to more noise, because they permit the rail to vibrate over a greater length.|$|E
25|$|In the Eastern Asian hemisphere, {{hepatocellular}} carcinoma (HCC) {{is the most}} common type of cancer. The common risk factor for HCC in Asia is the high diagnosis of Hepatitis B. However, in Japan the common risk factor is hepatitis C. Another <b>factor</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> causes HCC is a mycotoxin called aflatoxin. This mycotoxin is found among many areas in Asia with Southern China being the Asian country with the highest amount of aflatoxin. Thus, China is the country with the highest diagnosis of HCC in Eastern Asia.|$|E

25|$|In general, emitted {{fluorescent}} light has a longer wavelength and lower energy than the absorbed light. This phenomenon, known as Stokes shift, {{is due to}} energy loss between the time a photon is absorbed {{and when it is}} emitted. The causes and magnitude of Stokes shift can be complex and are dependent on the fluorophore and its environment. However, there are some common causes. It is frequently due to non-radiative decay to the lowest vibrational energy level of the excited state. Another <b>factor</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the emission of fluorescence frequently leaves a fluorophore in a higher vibrational level of the ground state.|$|E
25|$|In {{the human}} level, with the {{development}} of consciousness, love, although continuous with its lower forms, attains a higher form because of its relation to reason. In the beginning these two factors are in a natural harmony, but the one doesn't have conscious access to the other. Each one operates almost separately from the other. Then comes a stage where reason and love come in rapport and conflict with each other, yet the important <b>factor</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they start coming simultaneously in the conscious sphere. Then comes a third stage where a synthesis of love and reason is achieved to bring an altogether new type of consciousness, best described as superconsciousness.|$|E
25|$|A {{traditional}} wooden bat has {{its surface}} oiled with raw linseed oil before play, and regularly during the season. This has a protective {{effect on the}} wood, and also makes it less sensitive to humidity changes in the atmosphere, which could cause warping or splitting. Another important <b>factor</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it increases the surface friction of the ball to bat surface, giving better control of the shot. A worn surface can be noticed by the player, indicating that re-oiling is needed. Raw linseed oil is used, rather than boiled linseed oil, as {{this is not a}} drying oil to the same degree, and so the surface remains tacky.|$|E
50|$|The {{result of}} all of these <b>factors,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> from 1980-2000, 10% of the forest cover in Mongolia was lost. This {{deforestation}} has caused lowering of groundwater levels, flash floods, and more desertification.|$|R

25|$|There is no agreed {{view on the}} net {{impact of}} {{immigration}} in current times. Historically, Canada's unusually high immigration rates {{can be traced to}} the nation's unique economy. One <b>factor</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Canada has one of the world's largest supplies of natural resources such as oil, metals, and lumber. It also has a sparse population spread over a vast landscape. Canada has thus faced acute labour shortages and has responded by actively searching for immigrants. In the late 19th century this included bringing Chinese migrants to build the Canadian Pacific Railway and actively advertising in Europe to find farmers with the Last Best West campaign. Today similar recruitment efforts are needed to staff the oil sands projects in Alberta.|$|E
25|$|The {{two major}} Chinese {{philosophical}} schools discussed below, Confucianism and Legalism, strongly influenced {{the idea of}} law in China. Briefly, under Confucianism, the state should lead the people with virtue and thus {{create a sense of}} shame which will prevent bad conduct. Under Legalism, law is to be publicly promulgated standards of conduct backed by state coercion. The tension between these two systems is that Confucianism relies on tradition to make the leader the head of household of all China, while Legalism makes standard law that even the emperor should be bound by. The common <b>factor</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> both endorse to different degrees a paternalistic conception of the state, which knows better than its citizens and makes laws to protect them. This concept persisted throughout the imperial period, into the republican period, and can still be seen acting today.|$|E
25|$|Debate {{over the}} {{specific}} cause or {{causes of the}} Bengali famine hinges {{on a series of}} interlinked questions: when the nature and scope of the disaster were recognized, whether enough food was available at the provincial or national level (or via international food aid arranged by Great Britain) to feed the population of Bengal, and whether the failure of the colonial rulers to alleviate the crisis was due to incompetence or insensitivity to Bengal's needs. The relative impact of each of these factors as a cause or contributing factor to the levels of death and economic devastation is still a matter of controversy. In addition to the complexity of the issues and the questionable accuracy of much of the statistical data that could resolve the debates, a potentially complicating <b>factor</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the conclusions are highly politicised, which may tend to predispose the content and tone of the conclusions reached.|$|E

25|$|The role of U.S. General David Petraeus {{and others}} in Iraq {{suggests}} a continued need for proconsular leadership, according to Lord. Modern technology makes communication easier than ever. But as email and Power Point presentations proliferate, clarity and intellectual discipline is lost. Another <b>factor</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> civilian policymakers, whether on the spot or in the metropole, may lack {{the skills needed to}} manage military forces. Yet proconsuls are at best an ad hoc solution to a reoccurring problem. Managing a large territory in occupation or conflict requires a range of skills and the ability to deal with various organizations. No one is trained as a proconsul and the available administrators have experience in at most one relevant agency or service. During the Vietnam War, the U.S. attempted to deal with this issue by creating an integrated civilian-military command structure called Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support (CORDS).|$|E
25|$|Because Britain did not test {{as often}} as the United States for {{financial}} and political reasons, {{and did not have}} the Americans' state-of-the-art computer facilities, British weapons design depended more on theoretical understanding, with potential for both greater advances and greater risks between tests.The low number of UK tests is misleading when compared to the large number of tests carried out by the US, the Soviet Union, China, and especially France, because the UK has had extensive access to US test data, obviating the need for UK tests. An added <b>factor</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> many tests were for 'weapon effects tests': tests not of the nuclear device itself, but of the nuclear effects on hardened components designed to resist ABM attack. Numerous such 'effects' tests were done in support of the Chevaline programme especially, and {{there is some evidence that}} some were permitted for the French programme to harden their RVs and warheads; because most French tests were under the ocean floor, access to measure 'weapon effects' was nearly impossible. An independent test programme would have seen the UK numbers soar to French levels.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, milk-buying {{patterns}} have changed drastically in the UK. The classic milkman, who travels his local milk round (route) using a milk float (often battery powered) {{during the early}} hours and delivers milk in 1 pint glass bottles with aluminium foil tops directly to households, has almost disappeared. Two {{of the main reasons}} for the decline of UK home deliveries by milkmen are household refrigerators (which lessen the need for daily milk deliveries) and private car usage (which has increased supermarket shopping). Another <b>factor</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it is cheaper to purchase milk from a supermarket than from home delivery. In 1996, more than 2.5 billion liters of milk were still being delivered by milkmen, but by 2006 only 637 million liters (13% of milk consumed) was delivered by some 9,500 milkmen. By 2010, the estimated number of milkmen had dropped to 6,000. Assuming that delivery per milkman is {{the same as it was}} in 2006, this means milkmen deliveries now only account for 6–7% of all milk consumed by UK households (6.7 billion liters in 2008/2009).|$|E
