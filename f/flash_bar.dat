To examine whether position capture depends on low-level motion interactions or perception of integrated object motion, we employed a slit-view display. Two line-drawn diamonds translated horizontally in opposite directions, one above and one below the fixation cross, either behind an occluding surface with a narrow slit or without occluding surface. When the diamonds were in vertical alignment, two vertical <b>bars</b> were <b>flashed,</b> one {{in the center of each}} diamond. In the slit-view condition, the diamonds were visible through a 4 -, 2 -, or 1 -pixel vertical slit; the width of the <b>flashed</b> <b>bars</b> always matched the width of the slit. Even though the horizontal component of physical motion was greatly reduced or absent in the slit-view conditions, observers perceived diamonds moving behind the occluding surface. Furthermore, {{the position of}} the <b>flashed</b> <b>bar</b> was captured by the moving diamonds such that each bar appeared shifted in the direction of perceived motion. We conclude that the position capture reported here has a component based on high-level motion processing that is responsible for dynamically integrating object motion and shape...|$|R
40|$|NoMotion {{is known}} to distort visual space, {{producing}} illusory mislocalizations for flashed objects. Previously, {{it has been shown}} that when a stationary <b>bar</b> is <b>flashed</b> in the proximity of a moving stimulus, the position of the <b>flashed</b> <b>bar</b> appears to be shifted in the direction of nearby motion. A model consisting of predictive projections from the sub-system that processes motion information onto the sub-system that processes position information can explain this illusory position shift of a stationary <b>flashed</b> <b>bar</b> in the direction of motion. Based on this model of motionÂ¿position interactions, we predict that the perceived position of a flashed stimulus should also be attracted towards a nearby moving stimulus. In the first experiment, observers judged the perceived vertical position of a flash with respect to two horizontally moving dots of unequal contrast. The results of this experiment were in agreement with our prediction of attraction towards the high contrast dot. We obtained similar findings when the moving dots were replaced by drifting gratings of unequal contrast. In control experiments, we found that neither attention nor eye movements can account for this illusion. We propose that the visual system uses predictive influences from the motion processing sub-system on the position processing sub-system to overcome the temporal limitations of the position processing system...|$|R

We examined how some of these static RF features vary with contrast and contrast adaptation in area V 1 of the anesthetized macaque monkey. RFs were mapped with light and dark <b>flashing</b> <b>bars</b> presented at three different contrasts, with the low and medium contrasts eliciting approximately 1 / 3 and 2 / 3 of the high-contrast response amplitude. The main results are as follows: 1) RF widths decreased when contrast decreased; however, the amount of decrease was less than that expected from an iceberg model {{and closer to the}} expectation of a contrast invariance of the RF width. 2) Area tuning experiments with drifting gratings showed an opposite effect of contrast: an increase in preferred stimulus diameter when contrast decreased. This implies that the effect of contrast on preferred stimulus size is not predictable from the static RF. 3) Contrast adaptation attenuated the effect of contrast on RF amplitude but did not significantly modify RF width. 4) RF subregion overlap was only marginally affected by changes in contrast and contrast adaptation; the classification of cells as simple and complex, when established from subregion overlap, appears to be robust with respect to changes in contrast and adaptation state.

The improved reliability can be accounted for by a selective increase in spiking evoked by preferred stimuli, and the magnitude of improvement depends on the sparseness of the response. The increase in reliability persists for at least several minutes in the absence of further movie stimulation.

Thus, repeated exposure to natural stimuli not only induces a rapid improvement in cortical response reliability, but also leaves a 'memory trace' in subsequent spontaneous activity...|$|R

The resulting compression of perceived positions has been found to increase with the amplitude of the saccade. In most studies on perisaccadic compression the head is static, so the eye-in-head movement is equal to the change in gaze. What if moving the head causes part of the change in gaze? Does decreasing the eye-in-head rotation by moving the head decrease the compression of perceived positions? To find out, we asked participants to shift their gaze between two positions, either without moving their head or with the head contributing to the change in gaze. Around the time of the saccades we <b>flashed</b> <b>bars</b> that participants had to localize. When the head contributed to the change in gaze, the duration of the saccade was shorter and compression was reduced.

40|$|Saccadic {{suppression}} - {{the reduction}} of visual sensitivity during rapid eye movements - has previously been proposed to reflect a specific suppression of the magnocellular visual system, with the initial neural site of that suppression at or prior to afferent visual information reaching striate cortex. Dysfunction in the magnocellular visual pathway has also been associated with perceptual and physiological anomalies in individuals with autism spectrum disorder or high autistic tendency, leading us to question whether saccadic suppression is altered in the broader autism phenotype. Here we show that individuals with high autistic tendency show greater saccadic suppression of low versus high spatial frequency gratings while those with low autistic tendency do not. In addition, those with high but not low autism spectrum quotient (AQ) demonstrated pre-cortical (35 - 45 [*]ms) evoked potential differences (saccade versus fixation) to a large, low contrast, pseudo-randomly <b>flashing</b> <b>bar.</b> Both AQ groups showed similar differential visual evoked potential effects in later epochs (80 â 160 [*]ms) at high contrast.

40|$|A neural {{field model}} is {{presented}} that captures the essential non-linear characteristics of activity dynamics across several millimeters of visual cortex {{in response to}} local flashed and moving stimuli. We account for physiological data obtained by voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging which reports mesoscopic population activity at high spatio-temporal resolution. Stimulation included a single flashed square, a single <b>flashed</b> <b>bar,</b> the line-motion paradigm â for which psychophysical studies showed that flashing a square briefly before a bar produces sensation of illusory motion within the bar â and moving squares controls. We consider a two-layer neural field (NF) model describing an excitatory and an inhibitory layer of neurons as a coupled system of non-linear integro-differential equations. Under {{the assumption that the}} aggregated activity of both layers is reflected by VSD imaging, our phenomenological model quantitatively accounts for the observed spatio-temporal activity patterns. Moreover, the model generalizes to novel similar stimuli as it matches activity evoked by moving squares of different speeds. Our results indicate that feedback from higher brain areas is not required to produce motion patterns {{in the case of the}} illusory line-motion paradigm. Physiological interpretation of the model suggests that a considerable fraction of the VSD signal may be due to inhibitory activity, supporting the notion that balanced intra-layer cortical interactions between inhibitory and excitatory populations play a major role in shaping dynamic stimulu...|$|R

We also found that correlation was strongly stimulus-dependent, changing with direction and temporal frequency in a manner that generalized across model architectures. Our models make specific predictions for designing, optimizing, and interpreting electrophysiology experiments aimed at resolving DS circuitry and provide new insights into mechanisms that could underlie stimulus-dependent correlation.

40|$|Visual {{disappearance}} illusions â such as motion-induced blindness (MIB) - {{are commonly}} used to study the neural underpinnings of visual perception. In such illusions a salient visual target becomes perceptually invisible. Previous studies are inconsistent regarding the role of primary visual cortex (V 1) in these illusions. Here we provide physiological and psychophysical evidence supporting a role for V 1 in generating MIB. Some {{of the most striking}} visual illusions fall into the category of multistable phenomena. These are situations in which an unchanging stimulus generates alternating perceptual states. Some examples are Necker cube reversals, binocular rivalry, ambiguous structure from motion and motion-induced blindness 1. Motion-induced blindness (MIB) is a phenomenon of visual disappearance in which a salient target becomes intermittently invisible when surrounded by a field of rotating distractors 1. Several explanations have been proposed to explain this illusion: slowdown of the attentional switch 1, interhemispheric competition 2, depth ordering, surface completion 3 and perceptual filling-in 4 among others.

40|$|When {{images are}} {{stabilized}} on the retina, visual perception fades. During voluntary visual fixation, however, constantly occurring small eye movements, including microsaccades, prevent this fading. We previously showed that microsaccades generated bursty firing {{in the primary}} visual cortex (area V- 1) {{in the presence of}} stationary stimuli. Here we examine the neural activity generated by microsaccades in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), and in the area V- 1 of the awake monkey, for various functionally relevant stimulus parameters. During visual fixation, microsaccades drove LGN neurons by moving their receptive fields across a stationary stimulus, offering a likely explanation of how microsaccades block fading during normal fixation. Bursts of spikes in the LGN and area V- 1 were associated more closely than lone spikes with preceding microsaccades, suggesting that bursts are more reliable than are lone spikes as neural signals for visibility. In area V- 1, microsaccade-generated activity, and the number of spikes per burst, was maximal when the bar stimulus centered over a receptive field matched the cell's optimal orientation. This suggested burst size as a neural code for stimuli optimality (and not solely stimuli visibility). As expected, burst size did not vary with stimulus orientation in the LGN. To address the effectiveness of microsaccades in generating neural activity, we compared activity correlated with microsaccades to activity correlated with <b>flashing</b> <b>bars.</b> Onset responses to flashes were about 7 times larger than the responses to the same stimulus moved across the cells' receptive fields by microsaccades, perhaps because of the relative abruptness of flashes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the present}} study was to {{characterize}} the spatial and temporal features of synaptic and discharge receptive fields (RFs), and to quantify their relationships, in cat area 17. For this purpose, neurons were recorded intracellularly while high-frequency <b>flashing</b> <b>bars</b> were used to generate RFs maps for synaptic and spiking responses. Comparison of the maps shows that some features of the discharge RFs depended strongly on those of the synaptic RFs, whereas others were less dependent. Spiking RF duration depended poorly and spiking RF amplitude depended moderately on those of the underlying synaptic RFs. At the other extreme, the optimal spatial frequency and phase of the discharge RFs in simple cells were almost entirely inherited from those of the synaptic RFs. Subfield width, in both simple and complex cells, was less for spiking responses compared with synaptic responses, but synaptic to discharge width ratio was relatively variable from cell to cell. When considering the whole RF of simple cells, additional variability in width ratio resulted from the presence of additional synaptic subfields that remained subthreshold. Due to these additional, subthreshold subfields, spatial frequency tuning predicted from synaptic RFs appears sharper than that predicted from spiking RFs. Excitatory subfield overlap in spiking RFs was well predicted by subfield overlap at the synaptic level. When examined in different regions of the RF, latencies appeared to be quite variable, but this variability showed negligible dependence on distance from the RF center. Nevertheless, spiking response latency faithfully reflected synaptic response latency...|$|R
40|$|Cross-correlation {{study of}} the {{temporal}} interactions between areas V 1 and V 2 of the macaque monkey. Cross-correlation studies performed in cat visual cortex have shown that neurons in different cortical areas of the same hemisphere or in corresponding areas of opposite hemispheres tend to synchronize their activities. The presence of synchronization {{may be related to}} the parallel organization of the cat visual system, in which different cortical areas can be activated in parallel from the lateral geniculate nucleus. We wanted to determine whether interareal synchronization of firing can also be observed in the monkey, in which cortical areas are thought to be organized in a hierarchy spanning different levels. Cross-correlation histograms (CCHs) were calculated from pairs of single or pairs of multiunit activities simultaneously recorded in areas V 1 and V 2 of paralyzed and anesthetized macaque monkeys. Moving <b>bars</b> and <b>flashed</b> <b>bars</b> were used as stimuli. The shift predictor was calculated and subtracted from the raw CCH to reveal interactions of neuronal origin in isolation. Significant CCH peaks, indicating interactions of neuronal origin, were obtained in 11 of the dual single-unit recordings and 46 of the dual multiunit recordings with moving bars. The incidence of nonflat CCHs with <b>flashed</b> <b>bars</b> was 29 and 78, respectively. For the pairs of recording sites where both flashed and moving stimuli were used, the incidences of significant CCHs were very similar. Three types of peaks were distinguished on the basis of their width at half-height: T (180 ms). T peaks were very rarely observed (< 1 in single-unit recordings). H peaks were observed in 7 â 16 of the single-unit CCHs, and C peaks in 6 â 16, depending on the stimulus used. C and H peaks were observed more often when the receptive fields were overlapping or distant by < 2 Â°. To test for the presence of synchronization between neurons in areas V 1 and V 2, we measured the position of the CCH peak with respect to the origin of the time axis of the CCH. Only in the case of a few T peaks did we find displaced peaks, indicating a possible drive of the V 2 neuron by the simultaneously recorded V 1 cell. All the other peaks were either centered on the origin or overlapped the origin of time with their upper halves. Thus similarly to what has been reported for the cat, neurons belonging to different cortical areas in the monkey tend to synchronize the time of emission of their action potentials with three different levels of temporal precision. For peaks calculated from flashed stimuli, we compared the peak position with the difference between latencies of V 1 and V 2 neurons. There was a clear correlation for single-unit pairs in the case of C peaks. Thus the position of a C peak on the time axis appears to reflect the order of visual activation of the correlated neurons. The coupling strength for H peaks was smaller during visual drive compared with spontaneous activity. On the contrary, C peaks were seen more often and were stronger during visual stimulation than during spontaneous activity. This suggests that C-type synchronization is associated with the processing of visual information. The origin of synchronized activity in a serially organized system is discussed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA flash that is {{presented}} {{adjacent to a}} continuously moving bar is perceived to lag behind the bar. One explanation for this phenomenon {{is that there is}} a difference in the persistence of the <b>flash</b> and the <b>bar.</b> Another explanation is that the visual system compensates for the neural delays of processing visual motion information, such as the moving bar, by spatially extrapolating the barâs perceived location forward in space along its expected trajectory. Two experiments demonstrate that neither of these models is tenable. The first experiment masked the flash one video frame after its presentation. The flash was still perceived to lag behind the bar, suggesting that a difference in the persistence of the <b>flash</b> and <b>bar,</b> does not cause the apparent offset. The second experiment employed unpredictable changes in the velocity of the bar including an abrupt reversal, disappearance, acceleration, and deceleration. If the extrapolation model held, the bar would continue to be extrapolated in accordance with its initial velocity until the moment of an abrupt velocity change. The results were inconsistent with this prediction, suggesting that there is little or no spatial compensation for the neural delays of processing moving objects.

Our question is whether the mislocalization is related to the position of the saccade target within the image or to the gaze position at the end of the saccade. We separated the two with a visual illusion that influences the perceived distance to the target of the saccade and thus saccade endpoint without affecting the perceived position of the saccade target within the image. We asked participants to make horizontal saccades from the left to the right end of the shaft of a MÃ¼ller-Lyer figure.

In general, bars were misperceived in the direction of the slow-phase tracking movement. <b>Bars</b> <b>flashed</b> around the onset of the fast-phase movements were subject to much less mislocalization, pointing to a competing shift in the direction of the fast-phase, as occurs with saccades. However, as distinct from saccades, there was no evidence for spatial compression {{around the time}} of the corrective fast-phase OKN. The results suggest that OKN cause perceptual mislocalizations similar to those of smooth pursuit and saccades, but there are some differences in the nature of the mislocalizations, pointing to different perceptual mechanisms associated with the different types of eye movements.
