The results found voters supported recalling Giron by 54% to 42%, with 4% undecided.|$|E
5|$|The timing {{could not}} have been better for the Vale Royal community, <b>for</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> storm 19 October 1360 the arcades of the {{unfinished}} nave of their abbey church collapsed, and rebuilding {{could not have}} been funded by the abbey without outside help; even so, their original ambitious plans were never carried out in full. It has been suggested that the transfer was arranged, after the collapse, in order to provide funds for Vale Royal Abbey to repair their church. However the legal formalities, beginning with the appropriation by the feofees, was too soon after the storm to realistically have been in response to that event. Given that the abbey was already – and remained – in debt, the reason for the appropriation was probably related to that. As corporate rector, Vale Royal Abbey was responsible for appointing a vicar and for the care of the chancel, leaving the rest of the church to be maintained by the parish.|$|E

25|$|An opening batsman, {{with the}} style of Mohammed Azharuddin, much was {{expected}} of Jaffer as he entered Test cricket <b>for</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> home series against South Africa in 2000. However, the experienced bowlers Shaun Pollock and Allan Donald proved too {{difficult for him to}} cope with, and he managed just 46 runs from his four innings. He would not start another international match for some time, eventually returning in May 2002 for a tour of the West Indies. Jaffer had a respectable series, making 51 in Bridgetown and 86 at Antigua. He had done enough {{to be included in the}} Indian squad for their tour of England the following summer but, despite a half century at Lord's, he struggled in his other innings and was dropped after two Tests.|$|E

25|$|Any n-vertex forest has pathwidth O(logn).(2n+1) on the pathwidth of an n-vertex forest. <b>For,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> forest, one {{can always}} find a {{constant}} number of vertices the removal of which leaves a forest that can be partitioned into two smaller subforests with at most 2n/3 vertices each. A linear arrangement formed by recursively partitioning each of these two subforests, placing the separating vertices between them, has logarithmic vertex searching number. The same technique, applied to a tree-decomposition of a graph, shows that, if the treewidth of an n-vertex graph G is t, then the pathwidth of G is O(tlogn). Since outerplanar graphs, series-parallel graphs, and Halin graphs all have bounded treewidth, they all also have at most logarithmic pathwidth.|$|E

25|$|On 7 August 2004, Ménez {{made his}} {{professional}} {{debut in the}} club's opening match of the 2004–05 season against Ajaccio. He started the match and played 57 minutes before being substituted <b>for</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 1–0 win. Despite being so young, Ménez was a regular within the team, often rotating between the bench and starting XI. On 20 November, he scored his first professional goal in a 3–1 victory over Monaco. Two months later, Ménez became the youngest player in league history to score a hat-trick after recording one in the team's 4–0 victory over Bordeaux. He scored the goals in a seven-minute span to assure Sochaux of victory. Ménez was a regular during the team's 2004–05 UEFA Cup campaign, appearing in six matches with the club. Sochaux suffered elimination in the Round of 32 {{at the hands of}} Greek club Olympiakos. Following the season, Ménez was nominated for the UNFP Young Player of the Year award but lost out to Nantes midfielder Jérémy Toulalan.|$|E

25|$|Creosote was {{suggested}} {{as a treatment}} for tuberculosis by Reichenbach as soon as 1833. Following Reichenbach, it was argued for by John Elliotson and Sir John Rose Cormack. Elliotson, inspired by the use of creosote to arrest vomiting during an outbreak of cholera, suggested its use for tuberculosis through inhalation. He also suggested it for epilepsy, neuralgia, diabetes and chronic glanders. The idea of using it for tuberculosis failed to take hold, and use of this purpose was dropped, until the idea was revived later in 1876 by the British doctor G. Anderson Imlay, who suggested it be applied locally in spray to the bronchial mucous membrane. This was followed up in 1877 when it was argued <b>for</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> clinical paper by Charles Bouchard and Henri Gimbert. Germ theory had been established by Pasteur in 1860, and Bouchard, arguing that a bacillus was responsible for the disease, sought to rehabilitate creosote for its use as an antiseptic to treat it. He began a series of trials with Gimbert to convince the scientific community, and claimed a promising cure rate. A number of publications in Germany confirmed his results in the following years.|$|E
25|$|Bates trialled at both English League Two club Darlington and Belgian club K.V. Mechelen, {{receiving}} {{an offer from}} the latter after scoring a hat-trick in a trial game. He turned it down however, to play in his home country with Darlington, for whom he had already scored <b>for</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> trial match against Hartlepool United. Bates officially joined Darlington on 3 February 2006, signing a short-term deal until June 2006. Bates made his Darlington league debut the day after signing, coming on as a substitute in the team's 0–0 draw with Boston United. Despite being unable to find {{the back of the}} net in that match, it took Bates just 10 minutes into his next appearance to score his first Darlington goal, in a 2–0 reserves win against Hull City. Over the remainder of the season, Bates could not find a regular starting spot in the Darlington line-up, and played just nine games for one goal as the team finished 8th in the league. Bates was released by the club in May 2006,. He then played for KV Oostende in the Belgian Second Division.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1918, Dr. Cadbury treated lepers, {{who were}} outpatients in the Canton Hospital leprosy clinic, for one year. The Canton Hospital {{was the first}} to have an {{organized}} leprosy clinic in China. He injected these patients with a mixture of chaulmoogra oil, resorcin, and camphorated oil. Then, he reported the results in The China Medical Journal in 1920. He wrote:"We must state that the various remedies, as outlined above, while in most cases of leprosy they have definite therapeutic value, yet unless the patients are cared <b>for</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sanatorium, given proper food, together with baths and attention to personal hygiene, a complete cure can hardly be looked for."In 1926, Dr. Cadbury tackled widespread issue of Chinese children not knowing their birth dates. He collected information from 1013 Cantonese children. His calculations to estimate the ages of these children revealed an understanding of the customs of the Canton people. For example, he learned that most of the children claimed they were born in August, September, and October most likely due to the tradition that Canton merchants were gone for most of the year except around Chinese New Year.|$|E
