5|$|A {{number of}} {{alterations}} are {{visible to the}} naked eye as pentimenti. A piece of paper draped over the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> is clearly visible in outline, despite having been painted over with detailing of the table itself. Sigismunda's index finger which was bent towards and perhaps touching the heart has been straightened, but the outline of the tip is still visible on the surface of the heart. A looped cord in the top right-hand corner is poorly concealed under the topmost layer of paint. It is also known that, to attempt to appease critics, Hogarth repainted the fingers of Sigismunda so that the blood that was previously there would no longer be visible.|$|E
5|$|Jump {{distance}} is measured from the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> to {{the placement of}} landing by increments of 0.5m. This is done using electronic and video monitoring systems together with event personnel assigned to observe jumps {{by the side of}} the hill, known as 'distance measurers'. If enough jumps are deemed to be too far beyond the hill size, or near the 'fall line' as determined by the jury – the zone where the slope begins to flatten out – an immediate meeting is held between the jury and race director, which usually results in the start gate being lowered so as to check inrun speeds and therefore distances. For spectators and judges, increments of 5m are clearly indicated by rows of fir across the hill; a painted red line is used for the K-point, and a dashed red line for the hill size. Both sides of the hill are also marked highly visible in red to indicate the 'landing zone', while the point beyond the hill size is marked in green on the sides.|$|E
25|$|Colposcopy is {{performed}} with the woman lying back, legs in stirrups, and buttocks at the lower <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> (a position known as the dorsal lithotomy position). A speculum {{is placed in the}} vagina after the vulva is examined for any suspicious lesions.|$|E
40|$|Imagine a point {{particle}} travelling freely (without friction) on a table, undergoing elastic collisions with <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>The</b> <b>table</b> {{is just a}} bounded region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plane. This model {{resembles a}} game of billiards, but it looks much simpler- we have only one ball, which is a dimensionless point particle. There is no friction and <b>the</b> <b>table</b> has n...|$|R
25|$|Optical {{experiments}} {{should be}} carried out on an optical table with all laser beams travelling in the horizontal plane only, and all beams should be stopped at <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> Users should never put their eyes at <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horizontal plane where the beams are in case of reflected beams that leave <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|R
60|$|But Transome Kent was {{no longer}} listening. He had seized <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> billiard <b>table.</b>|$|R
25|$|The line of play is the {{configuration}} of played tiles on the table. It starts with a single tile and typically grows in two opposite directions when players add matching tiles. In practice, players often play tiles at right angles when the line of play gets {{too close to the}} <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
2500|$|According to one author [...] "The {{painting}} is often referenced for its immaculate depiction of non-Euclidean geometry", {{referring to the}} image on the convex mirror. Assuming a spherical mirror, the distortion has been correctly portrayed, except for the leftmost part of the window frame, the near <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and the hem of the dress.|$|E
2500|$|Another of Whall’s {{works in}} Gloucester Cathedral is the {{magnificent}} South African War Memorial window, the Great East Window in the Chapter House. Concerning this window, [...] Whall {{points out that}} there is a full description available on a notice board just by the window and he reminds us that the Chapter House was the building in which the Domesday Book was compiled and points out that the lower centre lights of the window represent William the Conqueror directing the compilation of the Book. [...] He asks us to notice the map hanging over the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and says that with the help of opera glasses the ancient names of the towns may be read.|$|E
6000|$|The {{officer had}} been looking at <b>the</b> backs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> books in the bookcases. Then he perched himself on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> centre <b>table</b> and remarked easily: ...|$|R
5000|$|Two {{other pieces}} {{constitute}} <b>the</b> Ensemble. <b>The</b> <b>Table</b> <b>of</b> Silence is a circular stone table surrounded by twelve hourglass-seats, which symbolize time. <b>The</b> <b>Table</b> <b>of</b> Silence represents <b>the</b> moment before the battle {{on which the}} combatants were going to participate.Nevertheless, the seats are not located close to <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>The</b> Gate <b>of</b> Kiss, of Banpotoc travertine (marble), features a kiss motif on the gate pillars.The transition to another life occurs through <b>The</b> Gate <b>of</b> Kiss. <b>The</b> Ensemble had been inaugurated on 27 October 1938.During the [...] "socialist Realism" [...] epoch, Brâncuși had been challenged as an exponent of cosmopolitan bourgeois formalism. However, in 1964 Brâncuși was [...] "rediscovered" [...] in Romania as a national genius, and consequently, <b>the</b> Ensemble <b>of</b> Târgu Jiu was restored, after {{a long period of}} degradation.|$|R
50|$|In nuclear physics, {{an atomic}} nucleus {{is called a}} halo nucleus or {{is said to have}} a nuclear halo when it has a core nucleus {{surrounded}} by a halo of orbiting protons or neutrons, which makes <b>the</b> radius <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nucleus appreciably larger than that predicted by the liquid drop model. Halo nuclei form at <b>the</b> extreme <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>of</b> nuclides — <b>the</b> neutron drip line and proton drip line — and have short half-lives, measured in milliseconds. These nuclei are studied shortly after their formation in an ion beam.|$|R

5000|$|Line: An {{expansion}} of [...] "Two Cup" [...] to {{any number of}} cups lined up in a single row a set distance from <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pong <b>table,</b> typically one paddle length.|$|R
50|$|Gastropholis {{shares with}} <b>the</b> other genera <b>of</b> Equatorial African lacertids (EAL; Adolfus, Congolacerta, Holaspis) the {{consistently}} absent parietal foramen, the parietal scale extending to <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parietal <b>table</b> {{and a single}} postnasal scale.|$|R
50|$|The painting's subtitle, Rather Death than Shame, {{takes on}} special {{significance}} {{during this time}} period. The basket is precariously situated on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uncovered <b>table,</b> against a starkly black backdrop, an omen to its own sacrificial destruction.|$|R
60|$|She {{sits on the}} <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> He {{sits beside}} her, and puts his arm wearily round her waist.|$|E
60|$|He was, perhaps, {{the first}} to realise the situation. Richard thrust {{his hands into his}} pockets and sat upon the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
60|$|She sat motionless, {{with her}} hand {{tightening}} over the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and he, too, said no more. She began to tremble violently.|$|E
50|$|Two Cup: Two cups {{are placed}} {{next to each}} other a set {{distance}} from <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pong <b>table,</b> typically one paddle length. Two cup can be played for points and/or simply until your two cups are gone.|$|R

"Now, Mister Gascoyne," [...] {{began the}} seaman, sitting down on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> small <b>table</b> beside <b>the</b> low pallet, {{and raising the}} lantern a little, while he gazed earnestly into the prisoner's face, [...] "I've reason to believe--" ...|$|R
50|$|Then, {{standing}} in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy <b>Table</b> (altar table) they venerate it, making prostrations {{if it is a}} weekday, or metanias if it is Sunday. The priest kisses the Gospel Book and <b>the</b> front <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy <b>Table,</b> <b>the</b> deacon kisses the blessing cross and <b>the</b> right (south) <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy <b>Table.</b> <b>The</b> deacon then receives the priest's blessing and they both say their vesting prayers, put on their sacred vestments, and begin <b>the</b> Liturgy <b>of</b> Preparation during which the bread and wine are prepared for the Eucharist. About half an hour before the Liturgy is scheduled to begin, the priest gives the blessing for the Little Hours (normally the Third Hour and Sixth Hour) to begin.|$|R

60|$|Nasha {{stood in}} the control room, {{watching}} the planet fall away behind them. She folded her arms, sitting down on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
6000|$|His {{words he}} seemed to be {{dragging}} out like words in an anthem; but Syme, who was watching, saw his long fingers rattle quickly on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crazy <b>table.</b> He read <b>the</b> message, [...] "You must go on. This devil has sucked me dry!" ...|$|R
6000|$|In the {{afternoon}} Hapley called upon the Vicar, and argued with him upon theological questions. They {{sat in the}} little arbour covered with briar, and smoked as they wrangled. [...] "Look at that moth!" [...] said Hapley, suddenly, pointing to <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wooden <b>table.</b>|$|R
60|$|Certainly no {{one would}} {{associate}} <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> insanity with Ronald Mervyn, as upon {{the day before the}} ball at his mother's house he sat on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ante-room <b>table,</b> and laughed and talked with a group of five young officers gathered round him.|$|R
60|$|Helen was {{scarcely}} less agitated. She caught {{hold of the}} <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> to steady herself. Her voice {{seemed to come from}} a great distance.|$|E
60|$|Hunterleys nodded. He {{had just}} {{come in from the}} bank and held his letters in his hand. Richard seated himself on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
60|$|The lioness {{placed her}} big, padded paws upon the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and raised herself while she {{carefully}} examined the toy {{that was her}} likeness.|$|E
60|$|Having {{no desire}} to receive a blow that might render him totally unconscious, or, perhaps, take his life, Anderson Rover said no more. He heard a match struck, and then {{a bit of a}} tallow candle was lit and placed on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kitchen <b>table.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, <b>the</b> Stone <b>Table</b> is <b>the</b> sacred {{place where}} Aslan is killed by Jadis, the White Witch. Around <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> is writing, {{possibly}} Narnian, and extremely old. In the movie, Edmund Pevensie had committed a sin against his siblings by telling Jadis about {{them on the}} premise that he would be king of Narnia. However, Jadis throws him in prison and he is later rescued by Aslan's army. The White Witch then travels to Aslan's camp where she states that <b>the</b> [...] "blood <b>of</b> any traitor is" [...] hers. She and Aslan have a private parlay and it is later revealed that Aslan has saved Edmund by offering himself to Jadis.|$|R
5000|$|The {{album cover}} depicts two mannequins in a sparsely {{furnished}} loft, {{facing each other}} over a <b>table,</b> with <b>the</b> lower part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dummies' bodies seated on chairs while the upper portions are perched on <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> It was shot by photographer Joe Lyons at his first photo studio in north London, and he described how he had set up the shot: [...] "I'd just shot some furniture for a furniture designer, and got paid with the furniture. I chose dummies and started work—a fortuitous series of events. I felt that the hi-tech furniture worked really well with <b>the</b> rough look <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room, and I put the cake—which was actually <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> my wedding cake—as {{a focus on the}} table." ...|$|R
