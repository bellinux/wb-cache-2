40|$|X-ray {{observations}} of hot gas in galaxy clusters often show steeper temperature gradients across cold fronts – contact discontinuities, {{driven by the}} differential gas motions. These sharp (few kpc wide) surface brightness/temperature discontinuities would be quickly smeared out by the electron thermal conduction in unmagnetized plasma, suggesting significant suppression of the heat flow across the discontinuities. In fact, {{the character of the}} gas flow near cold fronts is favorable for suppression of conduction by aligning magnetic field lines along the discontinuities. We argue that a similar mechanism is operating in the bulk of the gas. Generic 3 D random isotropic and incompressible motions increase the temperature gradients (in some places) {{and at the same time}} suppress the conduction by aligning the magnetic field lines perpendicular to the temperature gradient.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the {{interaction}} of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), when it has southward component, with the geomagnetic field leads to the formation of an enhanced pressure layer (EPL) near the magnetopause.

Flows in such media {{can be described}} by three path functions Λ_α, or, for a steady flow, by two stream functions λ_κ and an additional field such as the mass density ρ, velocity v, or travel time Δ t. While typical analyses of a <b>frozen</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> B are problem-specific and involve nonlocal gradients of the fluid element position x(t), we derive the general, local (in Λ or λ space) solution B=(∂x/∂Λ_α) _t B̃_αρ/ρ̃, where Lagrangian constants denoted by a tilde are directly fixed at a boundary hypersurface H̃ on which B is known. For a steady flow, ρ̃B/ρ=(∂x/∂λ_κ) _Δ tB̃_κ+vB̃_ 3 /ṽ; here the electric field E∼(B̃_ 2 ∇λ_ 1 -B̃_ 1 ∇λ_ 2) /ρ̃ depends only on λ_κ and the boundary conditions. Illustrative special cases include compressible axisymmetric flows and incompressible flows around a sphere, showing that viscosity and compressibility enhance the magnetization and lead to thicker boundary layers. Our method is especially useful for directly computing electric fields, and for addressing upstream magnetic fields that vary in spacetime. We thus estimate the electric fields above heliospheres and magnetospheres, compute the draping of magnetic substructure around a planetary body, and demonstrate the resulting inverse polarity reversal layer.

40|$|We {{theoretically}} study an emergent SU(2) symmetry {{which is}} suggested by recent magneto-transport measurements, carried out near two electrons filling of a carbon nanotube quantum dot. It emerges in the case where the spin and orbital Zeeman splittings {{cancel each other out}} for two of the one-particle dot levels among four. Using the Wilson numerical renormalization group, we show that a crossover from the SU(4) to SU(2) Fermi-liquid behavior occurs at two impurity-electrons filling as <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> increases. We also find that the quasiparticles are significantly renormalized as the remaining two one-particle levels move away from the Fermi level and are <b>frozen</b> at high <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields.</b> In order to clarify how the ground state evolves during such a crossover, we also reexamine the SU(N) Kondo singlet state for M impurity-electrons filling in the limit of strong exchange interactions. We show that the nondegenerate Fermi-liquid fixed point of Nozièes and Blandin can be described as a bosonic Perron-Frobenius vector for M hard-core bosons, each of which consists of one impurity-electron and one conduction hole. This interpretation can also be applied to the Fermi-liquid fixed-point without the SU(N) symmetry. Comment: 20 pages, 10 figures, Sec. III B. has been revised. J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. in pres...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{reports on}} the design and data from a new {{experimental}} platform, which uses the supersonic ablated plasma flow from an inverse wire array z pinch to create a highly diagnosed interaction geometry for studying magnetised reverse shocks. The flow (v~ 10 ^ 7 cm/s, Ms~ 4 - 5) is generated with a <b>frozen</b> in <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> (B~ 1 - 2 T, ReM~ 100) at a level sufficient to affect {{the structure of the}} shocks created by its collision with a stationary planar obstacle. In addition to the expected accumulation of stagnated plasma material in a thin, high density (strong shock) layer at the obstacle surface, a separate detached shock-like transition is also observed upstream of the obstacle, first observed at a distance ~c/wpi. Measurements of the reverse shock profile from Thomson scattering, interferometry, and local <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> probes, show that this “sub-shock” feature displays unusually small discontinuities in the plasma properties (velocity, density, temperature) despite the high Mach numbers of the flow. Analysis shows that this feature, which is weakly collisional during its formation phase, appears to be a consequence of the pile-up of magnetic flux brought by the flow, which accumulates at the obstacle surface and acts on the magnetised electrons of the flow. An apparent discrepancy between the field strength measured at the sub-shock and the magnetic pressure required to support it against the ram pressure of the flow is addressed {{towards the end of the}} thesis. Preliminary results using a newly fielded Faraday rotation diagnostic to measure the field distribution within the reverse shock structure suggests that a pressure balance is achieved via the generation of current loops within the region, which locally enhance the field strength. Future work is set out for continued investigation, including improvements to the diagnostic, and a proposal to adapt the wire array setup to study magnetic reconnection in colliding plasma flows.

40|$|Fluid flow {{below the}} core-mantle {{boundary}} is inferred from geomagnetic secular variation data, assuming <b>frozen</b> <b>magnetic</b> flux {{and a new}} physical assumption termed helical flow, in which the tangential divergence correlates with the radial vorticity. Helical flow introduces streamfunction diffusion and removes non-uniqueness in the inversion of the magnetic induction equation. We combine helical flow with tangential geostrophy and compare the following physical assumptions: tangential geostrophy, strong helicity, weak helicity and columnar flow, using geomagnetic field models from the 2000 Oersted and 1980 Magsat satellites. Our solutions contain some features found in previous core flow models, such as large mid-latitude vortices, westward drift {{in most of the}} southern hemisphere, and suggested polar vortices. However, our solutions contain significantly more flow along contours of the radial <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> than previous core flow models...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAny {{penetration}} of solar wind plasma into the magnetosphere would be precluded if the plasma were strictly <b>frozen</b> in the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> Such transfers cannot therefore be modeled {{in the frame}} of ideal MHD: they demand nonideal effects and are likely to involve reconnection at the magnetopause. The strong magnetic fluctuations observed at this boundary have been suggested {{for a long time to}} be responsible for these phenomena. The present study revisits two questions: what is the origin of the strong magnetopause fluctuations and by which mechanisms can they allow for reconnection? It is first confirmed that the preexisting magnetosheath fluctuations can be the primary cause of the strong magnetopause fluctuations. The phenomenon invoked in a preceding paper to explain their amplification, known as ``Alfven resonance,'' is ruled out and shown to be an artifact of ideal MHD. The amplification at the boundary is instead explained by a nonresonant mode conversion (due to the magnetopause gradient), followed by a trapping of the resulting Alfven wave in the boundary (due to the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> rotation). The trapped Alfven wave has strong amplitude and its finite frequency is responsible for a departure from ideal MHD associated with reconnection distributed all over the magnetopause surface. We evidence that reconnected magnetic flux, driven by the incident magnetosheath waves, is able in this way to penetrate the magnetosphere, and we show how a local reconnection rate can be estimated. This result should be the starting point for a new approach of the magnetopause transfer problem since, in this scenario, reconnection occurs without external electrostatic electric field, as in stationary X point models, and without any local instability, as in tearing type models...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{radiation}} drag force {{on the structure of}} relativistic electron-positron and electron-proton outflows are considered within the one-fluid approximation for quasi-monopole cold outflow. It is shown that for a Poynting-dominated case the drag force does not change the particle energy inside the fast magnetosonic surface. In this region the action of the drag results in a diminishing of the Poynting flux, not the particle flux. Outside the fast magnetosonic surface, for intermediate photon density the drag force may result in additional acceleration of the plasma. This acceleration {{is a result of the}} disturbance of magnetic surfaces under the action of the drag. At even larger distances particles are not <b>frozen</b> into the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> and the drag force decelerates them efficiently. In the case of extreme photon densities, the disturbance of magnetic surfaces becomes large and the drag force changes the total energy flux significantly, the particles becoming nonrelativistic. We find that for Active Galactic Nuclei the photon density is too low to disturb the parameters of an ideal MHD outflow. The drag action may result in additional acceleration of outgoing plasma only for central engines with very high luminosities. For cosmological gamma-ray bursts the drag force can strongly affect the process of formation of a Poynting-dominated outflow.

It is shown that {{the frequency of the}} excitation <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> has a great effect on the controllability of the MR fluid damper. As the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> frequency increases, the controllability of the MR fluid damper significantly reduces. There is a maximum frequency of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> for a given <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> strength or a minimum strength of the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> for a given <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> frequency to make the dynamic behavior of the MR damper be controllable. When the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> frequency is over the maximum one or the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> strength is less than the minimum one, the controllability of the MR fluid damper almost completely disappears and the dynamic behavior of the MR fluid damper with the sinusoidal <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> is the same as that without the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field...</b>|$|R
