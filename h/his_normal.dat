He soon returned to <b>his</b> <b>normal</b> life and began to excel in sports and academics.|$|E
5|$|He was not {{an elegant}} exponent. <b>His</b> <b>normal</b> {{language}} is flat and monotonous. But uneven, and significantly so. For this author is erudite, a fancier of words, and a collector. Hence many rarities, or even inventions... first, when depicting the measures of a military disciplinarian, he brings in technical terms redolent of the camp. Second, archaism, preciosity, and flowery words.|$|E
5|$|In any event, {{gold was}} present {{along the river}} in huge quantities.

5|$|Lasker's match {{record was}} as {{impressive}} between his 1896–97 re-match with Steinitz and 1914: he won {{all but one}} of <b>his</b> <b>normal</b> matches, and three of those were convincing defenses of his title. He first faced Marshall in the World Chess Championship 1907, when despite his aggressive style, Marshall could not win a single game, losing eight and drawing seven (final score: 11½−3½).|$|E
5|$|Roy {{started the}} first month of the season scoring at <b>his</b> <b>normal</b> rate, but by December it started showing that his knees, which have bothered him since college and were injured in April, were ailing due to lack of cartilage. He missed nine games before the Trail Blazers {{announced}} that he would be out indefinitely. It was widely speculated that Roy {{would not be able to}} play at an All-Star level again. This forced the team to start running its offense through forward LaMarcus Aldridge and backup guard Wesley Matthews.|$|E

5|$|By late 1830, and {{certainly}} {{by the spring}} of 1831, trouble in South Wales looked likely and, probably in response, Bute broke from <b>his</b> <b>normal</b> annual plans and in May travelled south from Scotland to Cardiff Castle. With a reform bill looking likely, tensions grew between the different political factions in Glamorganshire and how the potential new parliamentary seats should be shared out, especially between Bute and his conservative allies, Crawshay and Guest. Radical demonstrations occurred in Merthyr Tydfil, one of the largest industrial communities, in May, and the crowd set light to effigies of conservative politicians. Violence broke out and arrests were made on 10 May; the prisoners were released by the angry crowd and the local authorities effectively lost any control of the town. A general insurrection ensued on 30 May.|$|E

5|$|By {{this stage}} McCudden was {{suffering}} from combat fatigue. It manifested itself in his decisions, of late, to seek a victory at any price, which was alien to <b>his</b> <b>normal,</b> calculated approach to combat. Knowing he was to soon be sent home, he was obsessed with catching up to von Richthofen's score. His contribution to 56 Squadron at this time was impressive; the unit had claimed 175 enemy aircraft while reporting 14 pilots killed and missing and seven captured. As Flight Commander, B Flight, McCudden's pilots had shot down 77–52 of which were his—while losing four pilots. To celebrate his success he dined with Brigadier General John Higgins and the following evening was invited to the headquarters of General Julian Byng, General Officer Commanding the British Third Army, to be personally congratulated.|$|E
5|$|Conley was cross-examined by {{the defense}} for 16 hours over three days, but the defense failed to break his story. The defense then moved to have Conley's entire {{testimony}} concerning the alleged rendezvous stricken from the record. Judge Roan noted that an early objection might have been upheld, but since the jury could not forget what it had heard, he allowed the evidence to stand. The prosecution, to support Frank's alleged expectation of a visit from Phagan, produced Helen Ferguson, a factory worker who first informed Phagan's parents of her death. Ferguson testified that {{she had tried to}} get Phagan's pay on Friday from Frank, but was told that Phagan would have to come in person. Both the person behind the pay window and the woman behind Ferguson in the pay line disputed this version of events, testifying that in accordance with <b>his</b> <b>normal</b> practice, Frank did not disburse pay that day.|$|E

The rare instances {{in which he is}} shown without his cap, he has a bright red-to-auburn Jewfro. His hat and hairstyle were influenced by those of James Humphrey, a character whom Matt Stone portrayed in the 1993 film Cannibal! The Musical. While he originally voiced Kyle without computer manipulation, Stone now does so by speaking within <b>his</b> <b>normal</b> vocal range and then adding a childlike inflection. The recorded audio is edited with Pro Tools, and the pitch altered to make the voice sound more like that of a fourth grader.|$|E
