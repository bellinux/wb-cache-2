40|$|AbstractRecent {{studies have}} {{attempted}} to predict the severity of regurgitant lesions from jet size on Doppler flow maps. Jet size {{is a function of}} both regurgitant volume and fluid entrained from the receiving chamber and, for a free jet, is a function of its momentum at the orifice. However, regurgitant jets often approach or attach to cardiac walls, potentially altering their momentum and ability to expand by entrainment. Therefore, this study addressed the hypothesis that adjacent walls influence regurgitant jet size as seen on Doppler flow maps. Steady flow was driven through circular orifices (0. 02 to 0. 05 cm 2) at physiologic velocities of 2 to 5 m/s. At a constant flow rate and orifice velocity, orifice position was varied to produce three jet geometries: free jets, jets adjacent to a <b>horizontal</b> <b>chamber</b> wall lying 1 cm below the orifice and wall jets with the orifice {{at the level of the}} wall. Doppler color flow imaging was performed at identical instrument settings for all jets. Two long-axis views of the jet were obtained: a vertical view perpendicular to the wall, resembling that most commonly used in patients to image the length of the jet, and a horizontal view parallel to the chamber wall. Velocities along the jet were also measured by Doppler mapping. Jets with their orifices adjacent to the wall but not at its level were deflected toward the wall proximally (the Coanda effect), increasing jet area in the vertical plane by 8 ± 4 % compared with corresponding free jets (p < 0. 001), with no change in area in the horizontal plane. Wall jets with their orifices at the level of the wall were 34 ± 5 % smaller in area than free jets in the vertical plane (p < 0. 0005) and 13 ± 6 % larger in area in the horizontal plane (p < 0. 005). Distal velocities in jets encountering walls were higher than those of free jets (p < 0. 0002). Therefore, in the views perpendicular to walls (vertical views) most commonly used in vivo for imaging jets near cardiac structures, a jet lying along the wall will appear smaller than a free jet produced by the same regurgitant flow. The wall jet can entrain fluid and expand only on one side and it spreads laterally over the surface to a greater extent than usual. The area of a deflected jet is slightly increased by the Coanda effect, which draws the proximal jet toward the wall. Therefore, jet size cannot be related to the degree of regurgitation without considering jet geometry and adjacent walls...|$|E
40|$|The Arizona Department of Transportation is {{developing}} the Phoenix-Cas a Grande Highway Stormwater Interceptor Project to handle storm {{water in the}} Phoenix area. Rectangular conduits near the ground surface collect the storm water and convey it to a vertical part of the structure which has several components. At the lower elevation is a large excavated chamber called the sump. Extending from the sump to the ground surface is a circular surge shaft containing two vertical walls. A diaphragm wall {{near the center of}} the surge shaft forms a dropshaft at the upstream end. The free trajectory inlet and diaphragm wall deflect the incoming water 90 degrees into the vertical dropshaft entraining considerable air. The water-air mixture falls down the dropshaft impinging on the sump invert. The entrained air has the effect of reducing impact pressures on the invert of the sump. A second wall at the downstream end of the surge shaft provides an air vent for returning air to the ground surface. The purpose of the surge shaft is to reduce pressure surges in the system. Downstream of the sump-surge shaft is the deaeration chamber. The sump and deaeration chamber provide for energy dissipation and air removal. Some air rises to the water surface in the surge shaft and escapes; the remaining air is carried into the deaeration chamber where it is removed. The deaeration chamber contains a false crown provided with air slots. The air rises to the false crown and escapes through the air slots to a <b>horizontal</b> <b>chamber</b> above; this chamber conveys the air to the vertical air shaft at the downstream end of the surge shaft. It is desirable to remove most of the entrained air from the water before it enters the tunnels. The entrapped air in the tunnels reduces the capacity for storage and conveyance and introduces the danger of high waterhammer effects upon its sudden release, which could cause damage to the system. The release of high velocity air at ground surface structures could also be hazardous. The effectiveness of the sump and deaeration chamber in dissipating energy and removing the entrained air was one factor considered in the evaluation of the various types tested. At the downstream end of the deaeration chamber a cylindrical surface was provided as an efficient entrance to the transition. In the transition the cross section gradually changed from a square section to the round section of the exit tunnel. Design information was needed for the three drop structures in the project. The decision was made to construct one model which would provide the necessary information. The model was constructed to a scale of 1 : 21. 91 and modelled drop structure No. 3 (Moreland Street) which has a design discharge of 2634 cfs. To provide the necessary information for the other two structures, the model scale could be conveniently changed and the results from the 1 : 21. 91 model extrapolated; or, the existing model could be revised if necessary.

Five subterranean nests were excavated; one of them filled with liquid cement for extraction of casts of chambers, shafts and tunnels.

Nest enlargement occurred through the simultaneous enlargement of chambers, deepening of the nest and addition of more chambers. Chamber enlargement contributed most to nest growth. Chambers near the surface were elongate and tunnel-like, while deeper chambers were more compact in outline. As chambers were enlarged, their outlines became more complex and lobed. Workers were polymorphic with clearly distinguishable minor and major workers. The headwidth of minors averaged 1. 45 to 1. 65 mm, and that of majors 2. 30 to 2. 80 mm. The mean headwidth of minors increased significantly as the proportion of major workers increased, but the trend of major headwidths fell short of significance. The numerical proportion of majors ranged from 3 % to 38 % and averaged 15 % of the workers, while their biomass proportion ranged from 10 % to 75 %, averaging about 50 %. The queen was recovered in 6 of the 14 plaster nests, suggesting that the average colony of this polydomous species has 2. 3 nests. Because of the lateness of the season when casts were made (October), only two nests contained significant amounts of brood. The possible functional roles of nest architecture in ants are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Spotted pardalotes breed between August or September to December or January—generally {{earlier in}} the year in {{northern}} parts of their range and later in southern areas. The nest is an underground <b>horizontal</b> oval <b>chamber</b> lined with shredded bark, linked by a tunnel 0.5 to 1.5 m long to a hole in the side of a riverbank or slope in a shaded location. The chamber is generally higher than the entrance tunnel, presumably to avoid flooding. Birds have used carpet rolls and garage roll-a-doors to nest in on occasion. Pairs breed once a year, producing a clutch of 3 to 4 round shiny white eggs 16 mm long by 13 mm wide. The eggs are incubated for 19 days until they hatch, with nestlings spending another 21 days in the nest.|$|R
5000|$|The inland robust {{scorpion}} builds and {{resides in}} a spiral burrow in the sand. A field study near Broken Hill measured the burrows and found {{they all had}} the same basic structure: a sloping entrance chamber {{to a depth of}} 8-10 cm, followed by up to nine spiral turns leading to a lower <b>horizontal</b> terminal <b>chamber.</b> The depth of the burrow and number of spiral turns depended on the instar of the scorpion; the younger (2nd instar) scorpion burrows were 15-20 cm deep while those of the oldest (6th instar) scorpions reached a depth of around 100 cm. The scorpion digs by moving sand with its chelicerae and scraping it backwards under successive pairs of legs. The amount of sand removed can be 200-400 times its own weight. Experiments showed inland robust scorpions could build burrows in 8-10 hours.|$|R
30|$|Comet assay was {{performed}} {{according to the}} protocol of Singh et al. (1988) with minor modifications. Firstly, we pre-coated the slides with {{a thin layer of}} 1 % normal melting agarose. Secondly, the cells were harvested and resuspended at a concentration of 5  ×  105  cells/mL. 20  μL of each suspension was added to 80  μL of pre-melted 0.75 % low melting agarose and the contents were pipetted onto the pre-coated slide. Thirdly, the slides were immersed in neutral lysis solution in the dark at 4  °C for 2  h. For unwinding of the DNA, the slides were immersed in 1  × TBE buffer in the dark at 4  °C for 30  min. After that, the slides were exposed to ~ 0.74  V/cm for 25  min in the <b>horizontal</b> electrophoresis <b>chamber.</b> Following electrophoresis, we stained the slides with propidium iodine (PI). Fluorescence images were viewed with a microscope and analyzed by CASP- 1.2. 2 software (University of Wroclaw).|$|R
40|$|Reaction {{characteristics}} of combustion synthesis (CS) of β-SiAlON powders in a <b>horizontal</b> CS <b>chamber</b> were compared by including {{two types of}} additives (β-SiAlON and NaCl) in Si, SiO 2, and Al powder raw materials. The {{results showed that the}} reaction characteristics were influenced by the additives, which exerted a strong effect on the reaction rate and the morphology of the products. At the respective maximum combustion temperatures, a relatively slow conversion rate, with a reacted fraction (eta) of 58. 7 %, was achieved with the addition of 12 mass% NaCl to the raw materials, whereas the addition of 45 mass% β-SiAlON powders afforded eta = 88 %. The NaCl additive yielded rod-like crystals, which were well developed by a long after-burn time. However, self-sintering occurred in the presence of β-SiAlON powders. The results indicate that some degree of control over the conversion rate of the reaction and the microstructures of the product can be achieved by varying the type of additives...|$|R
50|$|In Panthera species, the dorsal {{profile of}} the skull is flattish or evenly convex. The frontal interorbital area is not noticeably elevated, and the area behind the {{elevation}} is less steeply sloped. The basicranial axis is nearly <b>horizontal.</b> The inner <b>chamber</b> of the bullae is large, the outer small. The partition between them {{is close to the}} external auditory meatus. The convexly rounded chin is sloping. All Panthera species have an incompletely ossified hyoid bone. Specially adapted larynx with proportionally larger vocal folds are covered in a large fibro-elastic pad. These characteristics enable all Panthera species except snow leopard to roar.|$|R
