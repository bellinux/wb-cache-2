5|$|The 1866 {{construction}} was considerably stronger, {{compared to the}} two previous spans, due to major renovations. The old cables that snapped {{had been replaced by}} newer, stronger ones. Thomas also gave the span a new deck floor, a bridge railing and new stringers. The bridge was much better cared for this time around, as it also survived a local flood in 1903 and an icestorm in the <b>early</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> spring 1904.|$|E
5|$|The second Königsberg {{class was}} {{authorized}} in 1913 and laid down starting in 1914. They were named for cruisers {{that had been}} sunk in the <b>early</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> the war.

They carried the standard eight 15cm guns, the forward wing mounts were placed a deck higher to improve their firing arc. They were otherwise identical to the preceding light cruiser designs.|$|E

5|$|This was {{virtually}} {{the only part}} of the Western Front, during the Phoney War, where there was significant aerial activity in the <b>early</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> the war, as RAF bombers flew unescorted raids on the German naval bases. So it did not take long for Specht to score his first victories: two Handley Page Hampden medium bombers in a squadron conducting an armed reconnaissance operation near Heligoland, shot down on 29 September. Needing a long-range fighter to better intercept the British bombers at distance, I./ZG 26 was thus the next Gruppe selected for re-equipping onto the Bf 110.|$|E
5|$|Vanderbeek was {{a strong}} proponent of the {{proposed}} arena in Newark, which first received funding from the city council during Puck Holdings' ownership in 2002. After legal battles over both eminent domain and the city's financial participation in the arena project, the final deal was approved by council in October 2004, during the <b>early</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> the lockout, and the groundbreaking occurred almost exactly a year later. Nonetheless, in January 2006, financial issues threatened to halt the deal, as the Devils did not provide the city with a required letter of credit until the last possible day.|$|E
5|$|Although Desha was universally {{acknowledged}} {{as the leading}} candidate during the <b>early</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> the campaign, as election day approached, some began to doubt whether he could withstand the withering attacks of the Anti-Relief Party. The Frankfort Argus, a pro-Desha newspaper, remained confident, however, predicting that the Relief candidate would win {{by a margin of}} 4-to-1. On election day, Desha secured a comfortable victory, receiving 38,378 votes, nearly 60% of the votes cast, and carrying large majorities even in some strongly Anti-Relief counties. Tompkins garnered 22,499 votes, with his support concentrated mostly in Central Kentucky. Russell finished third with 3,900 votes. Desha and his allies in the General Assembly interpreted the victory as a mandate from the voters to aggressively pursue their debt relief agenda.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of war between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the French Republic {{in the early spring}} of 1793, the French Revolutionary Wars were already a year old. The French Navy was already suffering from the upheavals of the French Revolution and the consequent dissolution of the professional officer class, while the Royal Navy had been at a state of readiness since the summer of 1792. During the <b>early</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> the war the French Navy focused heavily on raiding and disrupting British commerce and deployed frigates on raiding operations against British commercial shipping. In the English Channel, two of the most successful raiders were the frigates Réunion and Sémillante, based in Cherbourg on the Cotentin Peninsula. These frigates would make short cruises, leaving Cherbourg in the early evening and returning in the morning with any prizes they had encountered during the night.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2007–08 season it was learned that former manager Danny Bergara had died. Stockport County {{continued}} their success, despite losing an FA Cup first round replay away to non-League Staines Town on penalties. The <b>early</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> 2008 saw Stockport equal a league record of eight consecutive away victories. Approaching the end of the season, they had an outside chance to qualify for promotion automatically but missed out, finishing the season in fourth place. However, after beating Wycombe Wanderers 2–1 on aggregate in the play-off semi-final, Stockport played Rochdale at Wembley in the final, coming from behind to secure a 3–2 victory and earn promotion to League One for the next season.|$|E
5|$|Concentrating at Ravenshoe, in Queensland, in the <b>early</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> 1943 the 2/33rd was reorganised {{as part of}} the 7th Division's {{conversion}} to the jungle divisional establishment. As a part of this, the battalion's establishment was dropped to just over 800 men and it lost its carrier platoon, receiving in its place a machine gun platoon equipped with four Vickers machine guns. In addition, the anti-aircraft platoon was re-roled as a tank-attack platoon and the transport platoon was reduced to a third, with its complement of 74 vehicles and 14 motorcycles being replaced by 25 jeeps. Following this, an intense period of training was undertaken as the battalion received a batch of around 300 reinforcements to replace its losses in New Guinea; by July it was ready to deploy once again and subsequently returned to New Guinea to join the Salamaua–Lae campaign.|$|E
