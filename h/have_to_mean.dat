It felt like it should groove there. But I knew it couldn't groove without any vocals, so I started humming along with it and that's what happened. The 'shoops' came. But they felt so good, I thought 'Why not?' It doesn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> anything." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, even granted the above, {{it does not}} follow that {{identity}} theories of all types must be abandoned. According to token identity theories, the fact that a certain brain state is connected with only one mental state of a person does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> that there is an absolute correlation between types of mental state and types of brain state. The type–token distinction can be illustrated by a simple example: the word [...] "green" [...] contains four types of letters (g, r, e, n) with two tokens (occurrences) of the letter e along with one each of the others.|$|E

500|$|Christian makes a bet {{with his}} {{co-workers}} {{that he can}} seduce one of the Mormons, and [...] soon realizes that Aaron, the most inexperienced missionary, is a closeted homosexual. Aaron and Christian become acquainted after several encounters in the apartment complex. When Christian accidentally cuts himself on a metal hose reel and faints, Aaron helps him indoors and cleans his wound. Christian attempts to seduce Aaron, but the hesitant Mormon becomes upset by Christian's remark that sex [...] "doesn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> anything." [...] Aaron accuses him of being shallow and walks out. Worried that Aaron is correct, Christian joins Project Angel Food, delivering meals to people with AIDS.|$|E
500|$|The {{other three}} episodes {{of the season}} did not match the viewership of [...] "Bop Gun", but they were {{nevertheless}} considered strong ratings for the show, better than past Homicide episodes and the average rating for L.A. Law. Homicides improved ratings in the Thursday night timeslot fueled speculation that L.A. Law might be canceled and Homicide would take its place. Warren Littlefield denied such claims, believing the success of one series did not necessarily <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> the cancellation of the other. Despite Homicides improvement in the ratings, NBC did not immediately commit to a third season until the producers agreed to even more changes, including more prominent guest stars, more women in the cast and more life-affirming storylines. Outgoing cast member Polito publicly decried these changes, claiming the show {{was going to change}} from a drama into a [...] "soap opera".|$|E

It is simple, however, to describe evaluation as interpretation: To evaluate a list whose car names a function, [...] first evaluates {{each of the}} arguments given in its cdr, then applies the function to the arguments. In this case, the function is addition, and applying it to the argument list [...] yields the answer [...] This {{is the result of}} the evaluation.|$|E

2500|$|The CIA {{was under}} great {{pressure}} from the Kennedy Administration to, [...] "Do something about Castro and his regime." [...] Because the assassination of Castro {{seemed to be an}} important goal of the Kennedy administration, a myth has been created in American history that Kennedy was obsessed with the idea of killing Castro. However, this is not true. An article entitled [...] "Castro Assassination Plots" [...] states, [...] "CIA plots to kill Castro began before John Kennedy won the presidency and they continued after he was dead.". [...] In a report written by the CIA's inspector general in 1967, he admits that this is the reason behind the fanciful nature of many of the assassination attempts. He also said he warned that assassinating Castro would not necessarily destabilize the government in the manner that is desired. In fact, he didn't think the assassination of Castro would do much to free Cuba from communist control. He mentions that people became too focused on the idea of killing Castro when, [...] "getting rid of Castro" [...] doesn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> killing him. Due to this micro focus, broader, more complex plans with greater chances of success were not made.|$|E
2500|$|The wings {{themselves}} are sometimes {{said to be}} highly modified (tracheal) gills. And {{there is no doubt}} that the tracheal gills of the mayfly nymph in many species look like wings. By comparing a well-developed pair of gill blades in the naiads and a reduced pair of hind wings on the adults, it is not hard to imagine that the mayfly gills (tergaliae) and insect wings have a common origin, and newer research also supports this. [...] The tergaliae are not found in any other order of insects, and they have evolved in different directions with time. In some nymphs/naiads the most anterior pair has become sclerotized and works as a gill cover for the rest of the gills. Others can form a large sucker, be used for swimming or modified into other shapes. But it doesn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> that these structures were originally gills. It could also mean that the tergaliae evolved from the same structures which gave rise to the wings, and that flying insects evolved from a wingless terrestrial species with pairs of plates on its body segments: three on the thorax and nine on the abdomen (mayfly nymphs with nine pairs of tergaliae on the abdomen exist, but so far no living or extinct insects with plates on the last two segments have been found). If these were primary gills, it would be a mystery why they should have waited so long to be modified when we see the different modifications in modern mayfly nymphs.|$|E

6000|$|The socialists, it seems, believe with Alphonse Karr, in the {{expediency}} of {{abolishing the}} death penalty; but apparently {{they do not}} hold, with him, that the assassins should begin. They want the state to begin, believing that the magnanimous example will effect {{a change of heart}} in those about to murder. This, I take it, is the meaning of their assertion that death penalties have not the deterring influence that imprisonment for life carries. In this they obviously err: death deters at least the person who suffers it--he commits no more murder; whereas the assassin who is imprisoned for life and immune from further punishment may with impunity kill his keeper or whomsoever he {{may be able to get}} at. Even as matters now are, incessant vigilance is required to prevent convicts in prison from murdering their attendants and one another. How would it be if the [...] "life-termer" [...] were assured against any additional inconvenience for braining a guard occasionally, or strangling a chaplain now and then? A penitentiary may be described as a place of punishment and reward; and under the system proposed, the difference in desirableness between a sentence and an appointment would be virtually effaced. To overcome this objection a life sentence would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>mean</b> solitary confinement, and that means insanity. Is that what these gentlemen propose to substitute for death? ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{voice of}} Theosophy has been heard {{in favor of}} downing the gallows. As usual the voice is a trifle vague and it babbles. Clear speech is the outcome of clear thought, and that is {{something}} to which Theosophists are not addicted. Considering their infirmity in that way, it would be hardly fair to take them as seriously as they take themselves, but when any considerable number of apparently earnest citizens unite in a petition to the Governor of their State, to commute the death sentence of a convicted assassin without alleging a doubt of his guilt the phenomenon challenges a certain attention to what they do allege. What these amiable persons hold, it seems, is what was held by Alphonse Karr: the expediency of abolishing the death penalty; but apparently they do not hold, with him, that the assassins should begin. They want the State to begin, believing that the magnanimous example will effect a change of heart in those about to murder. This, I take it, is the meaning of their assertion that [...] "death penalties have not the deterring influence which imprisonment for life carries."
