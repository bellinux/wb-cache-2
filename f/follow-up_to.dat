40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} reporting, extent, and {{handling}} of loss <b>to</b> <b>follow-up</b> {{and its potential}} impact on the estimates {{of the effect of}} treatment in randomised controlled trials. DESIGN: Systematic review. We calculated the percentage of trials for which the relative risk would no longer be significant under a number of assumptions about the outcomes of participants lost <b>to</b> <b>follow-up.</b> DATA SOURCES: Medline search of five top general medical journals, 2005 - 07. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials that reported a significant binary primary patient important outcome. RESULTS: Of the 235 eligible reports identified, 31 (13 %) did not report whether or not loss <b>to</b> <b>follow-up</b> occurred. In reports that did give the relevant information, the median percentage of participants lost <b>to</b> <b>follow-up</b> was 6 % (interquartile range 2 - 14 %). The method by which loss <b>to</b> <b>follow-up</b> was handled was unclear in 37 studies (19 %); the most commonly used method was survival analysis (66, 35 %). When we varied assumptions about loss <b>to</b> <b>follow-up,</b> results of 19 % of trials were no longer significant if we assumed no participants lost <b>to</b> <b>follow-up</b> had the event of interest, 17 % if we assumed that all participants lost <b>to</b> <b>follow-up</b> had the event, and 58 % if we assumed a worst case scenario (all participants lost <b>to</b> <b>follow-up</b> in the treatment group and none of those in the control group had the event). Under more plausible assumptions, in which the incidence of events in those lost <b>to</b> <b>follow-up</b> relative <b>to</b> those followed-up is higher in the intervention than control group, results of 0 % to 33 % trials were no longer significant. CONCLUSION: Plausible assumptions regarding outcomes of patients lost <b>to</b> <b>follow-up</b> could change the interpretation of results of randomised controlled trials published in top medical journals...|$|R

5|$|Augie March {{returned}} to the studio in 2004 to record a <b>follow-up</b> <b>to</b> Strange Bird. The band worked with two producers, Paul McKercher and Eric Drew Feldman, and recorded in Melbourne, San Francisco, and their own studio in Nagambie, Victoria. Donovan said it was more suited to the band's style; as they co-produced on all their albums, they took {{a great deal of}} interest in production. He said it also enabled them to work at their own pace, hence the four-year gap between releases. They released a DVD, Drones & Vapid Ditties, containing live performances and music videos, in mid-2004. The band's upcoming album, according to Triple J, was inspired by the streets of Melbourne. Upon completion of the initial recording sessions of Moo, You Bloody Choir, there was a six-month delay before release, as Augie March meticulously added finishing touches to it. In March 2006, the album was finally released.|$|E
