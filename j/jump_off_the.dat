5|$|Between 1989 and 1991, Rahl {{installed}} planking {{and guard}} rails {{on the southern}} half of the bridge, which was then opened to the public. He allowed bungee jumping off the bridge until a January 1992 court order held that it violated zoning laws. One person tried to bungee <b>jump</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> bridge without a restraining cord. The bridge was slightly damaged by a fire in mid-1999, but it was repaired by September of that year.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{receives}} Doggett and Mulder's message, {{and tells}} them that Kersh has broken the quarantine. Mulder destroys the platform's radio {{so that the}} black oil-infected crew cannot communicate with the aliens. Suddenly, the platform workers stop their attack and begin to sabotage the rig. Doggett and Mulder leave the radio room, and <b>jump</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> rig when they realize that the crew are going to destroy it. They are rescued by the helicopters Kersh has sent to break the quarantine. Later, at the FBI, Mulder tells Doggett {{that he has been}} dismissed from the bureau.|$|E
5|$|Akash (Ranbir Kapoor) {{lives in}} New York City; he has bankrupted his company {{and is in}} need of $12 million for paying the shareholders, but is unable to obtain a loan due to a stock market crash. He decides to <b>jump</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> George Washington Bridge. He meets Kiara (Priyanka Chopra), from San Francisco, who is also suicidal after {{catching}} her fiancé Kunal (Zayed Khan) cheating on her. Akash and Kiara attempt to kill themselves, but are prevented from doing so by the Coast Guard. Still suicidal, Akash deliberately allows himself to be hit by a car, and Kiara falls on the bridge and breaks her neck. Their suicide attempts are unsuccessful, and they end up in hospital together. When they are discharged, Kiara takes Akash to her apartment because his house has been seized by the bank.|$|E

5|$|The captain puts Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{in charge}} of a prop wheel, which Dwight thinks is real. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), who has brought his girlfriend Katy Moore (Amy Adams) on the cruise with him, and Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) share an awkward moment alone on the deck away from their {{significant}} others. Michael continually tries to take charge of the event by standing next to the captain and interrupting everything he says. After Michael falsely declares that the ship is sinking, sending the passengers into a panic and causing one passenger to grab a life vest and <b>jump</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ship, the captain temporarily detains him by zip tying him to the railing on the deck outside.|$|E
5|$|During the night, Sideshow Bob {{reaches the}} {{houseboat}} and cuts it {{loose from the}} dock. Sideshow Bob then ties up Homer, Marge, Lisa, Maggie, and Santa's Little Helper to ensure they will not interfere with his plan. Sideshow Bob enters Bart's room, ready to kill him. Bart flees {{out the window and}} tries to escape, but he cannot <b>jump</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> boat. Sideshow Bob catches up to Bart and offers him a last request. Having noticed a sign saying that Springfield is fifteen miles away, Bart gets an idea; he compliments Sideshow Bob on his beautiful voice and asks him to sing the entire score of the H.M.S. Pinafore, to stall for time as the houseboat floats to Springfield. After the performance, Sideshow Bob advances on Bart again, but the boat runs aground, interrupting Sideshow Bob before he can finish him off. Sideshow Bob is arrested, and the Simpsons return home.|$|E
5|$|Inside, Rory {{finds himself}} drawn to an {{apartment}} with his name on it. Just as the Doctor and the others arrive, Rory finds an elderly version of himself in the bedroom. The Doctor warns that Rory's fate is now sealed—he will die in that room, without having seen Amy {{for a very long}} time beforehand. He deduces that the Angels have been using the Quay as a battery farm, sending the victims to their past while feeding off their time energy. Rory and Amy refuse to accept their fate, and as the Angels converge, they flee to the roof, where the Statue of Liberty, revealed to be a Weeping Angel, waits for them. Rory surmises that if he kills himself by jumping off the roof, he'll create a paradox that will destroy the building and the Angels, resetting the future. Refusing to allow him to die alone, Amy joins him and the two <b>jump</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> roof.|$|E

5|$|The team is {{inserted}} into the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan, where they make a trek through the mountains. Here, they begin to encounter communications problems, which will {{play a critical role}} in the following events. Upon arriving at their designated location, the SEALs are accidentally discovered by an elderly shepherd and two teenage goat herders. Knowing that if they release them, the herders will likely alert Taliban to their presence, the team is split about whether to kill the herders or not. After a brief debate, Luttrell convinces the others that they will incite backlash if they kill the three herders. The team decides to release them and abort the mission, but before they can escape, they are discovered by Taliban forces. Although they manage to kill several Taliban soldiers, they find themselves heavily outnumbered and at a significant tactical disadvantage. Each of the men suffers serious injuries during the firefight and, in an attempt to flee from the insurgents, they <b>jump</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> edge of a precipitous ridge and into a large ravine.|$|E

25|$|Upon recovering, {{he becomes}} a shell of his former self, {{remaining}} emotionally scarred and haunted by the promise he made to Annie in 1973, to return and save her from the fire-fight on the train. We see {{him back in the}} clinical, bureaucratic, modern world of policing. After alienating his cold, unsympathetic colleagues and confiding to his elderly mother, he commits suicide by joyfully taking a running <b>jump</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> police station roof.|$|E
25|$|On December 7, 1994, Stern made {{national}} news by preventing {{a man from}} committing suicide who was to <b>jump</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> George Washington Bridge. Caller, Emilio Bonilla was kept {{on the line for}} five minutes until Port Authority Police, whose tour commander was listening to the show, took Bonilla into custody. Bonilla was charged with cocaine possession, reckless endangerment and was taken to the hospital. Senator Al D'Amato and Ed Koch, former-Mayor of New York City, called in to congratulate Stern.|$|E
25|$|Olen Montgomery {{testified that}} he had been alone on a tank car the entire trip, and had not known about the fight or alleged rapes. Ozie Powell said that while he was not a participant, he had seen the fight with the white {{teenagers}} from his vantage point between a box car and a gondola car, where he had been hanging on. He said he saw the white teenagers <b>jump</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> train. Roberson, Montgomery, and Powell all denied they had known each other or the other defendants before that day. Andy Wright, Eugene Williams, and Haywood Patterson testified that they had previously known each other, but had not seen the women until the train stopped in Paint Rock. Knight questioned them extensively about instances in which their testimony supposedly differed from their testimony at their trial in Scottsboro. They did not contradict themselves in any meaningful way.|$|E

25|$|On a {{train with}} commanders of the revolution, John and Juan {{are joined by}} Dr. Villega, who has escaped. John alone knows of Villega's betrayal. They learn that Pancho Villa's forces will be delayed by 24 hours and that an army train {{carrying}} 1,000 soldiers and heavy weapons, led by Colonel Reza, will be arriving in a few hours, which will surely overpower the rebel position. John suggests they rig a locomotive with dynamite and send it head on. He requires one other man, but instead of picking Juan, who volunteers, he chooses Dr. Villega. It becomes clear to Villega that John knows of the betrayal. John nonetheless pleads with him to <b>jump</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> locomotive before it hits the army's train, but Villega feels guilty and stays on board. John jumps in time and the two trains collide and explode, killing Villega {{and a number of}} soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Vaginismus {{has been}} {{classified}} by Lamont {{according to the}} severity of the condition. Lamont describes four degrees of vaginismus: In first degree vaginismus, the patient has spasm of the pelvic floor that can be relieved with reassurance. In second degree, the spasm is present but maintained throughout the pelvis even with reassurance. In third degree, the patient elevates the buttocks to avoid being examined. In fourth degree vaginismus (also known as grade 4 vaginismus), the most severe form of vaginismus, the patient elevates the buttocks, retreats and tightly closes the thighs to avoid examination. Pacik expanded the Lamont classification to include a fifth degree in which the patient experiences a visceral reaction such as sweating, hyperventilation, palpitations, trembling, shaking, nausea, vomiting, losing consciousness, wanting to <b>jump</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> table, or attacking the doctor. The Lamont classification continues to be used to the present and allows for a common language among researchers and therapists.|$|E
25|$|When {{moving through}} areas, the player mostly modifies the {{landscape}} so that new paths can be opened. For example, {{in order to}} reach an isolated area, the player might have to bring down a platform by casting a gust of wind, climb onto the platform, and then return the platform to its original position and <b>jump</b> <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> player is also given tools to help with puzzles. One such tool acts as a reef blower or vacuum cleaner, moving items out of the way or defeating enemies. Some tools or objects must first be created on the controller's touch pad. Here, the player can draw the shape of an object and choose the colours. When finished, the item is then used in the game world wherever it is necessary. One instance of this occurs when the player is asked to create a butterfly design. The butterfly design the player creates can then be seen numerous times throughout each level {{for the rest of the}} game.|$|E

25|$|Denethor, the Steward of Gondor, {{was a more}} tragic {{character}} in the book. In the film, overwhelming grief {{over the death of}} Boromir has driven him to despair, and he has given up any hope of defeating Sauron before Gandalf arrives in Minas Tirith. Thus, the muster of Gondor is absent from the film, and major captains and generals (including Imrahil of the Tower Guard and the Knights of Dol Amroth) are not present. In the book, he has already ordered the lighting of the beacons before Gandalf's arrival, while he refuses to light them in the film, and the sequence where Pippin secretly lights them himself was invented for the movie. The film only hints at Denethor's use of the palantír which drives him mad, information revealed in the Pyre scene, which includes Shadowfax and is more violent than the book. Aware of the very long distance between Rath Dínen and the front of the out-thrust battlement, Jackson has Denethor <b>jump</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Citadel in addition to burning himself on the Pyre, one of the earliest changes.|$|E
25|$|Sunny soon {{left the}} team and Droz, then known as Puke (Darren Drozdov, a former {{defensive}} end for the Denver Broncos who earned the name Puke when caught vomiting on Monday Night Football), started to accompany them to the ring. At the same time, Paul Ellering returned, but sided with the Disciples of Apocalypse (DOA), whom LOD were feuding with at the time; Ellering and Animal explained on the DVD {{it was hard for}} them to rip on each other on promos. For the second {{time in the history of}} the Road Warriors they participated in a storyline where tension arose between the members, teasing a break up. In this storyline, Hawk was seen by his partner Animal as unfit to wrestle and Puke was tapped to take Hawk's place in the tag team as an official member. The angle played off Hegstrand’s real life alcohol and drug issues, going so far as to faking a suicide <b>jump</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> top of the TitanTron. After the angle bombed and both Hegstrand and Laurinaitis voiced their objections to it, the angle was dropped. The Legion of Doom made a very brief return, first on the March 22, 1999 Raw is War by attacking Pat Patterson and Gerald Brisco in a backstage skit after the two impersonated LOD in a handicap match against Shane McMahon, on the March 15, 1999 Raw is War. Both LOD entered the pre-WrestleMania battle royal with the last two participants getting a tag team title shot later at WrestleMania XV but both came up short. They would make one final appearance on the March 29, 1999 Raw challenging Owen Hart and Jeff Jarrett for the tag team titles but failed them; they left the WWF afterwards.|$|E
