5|$|Harriet Tubman, {{widely known}} and well-respected {{while she was}} alive, became an American icon {{in the years after}} she died. A survey {{at the end of the}} 20th century named her as one of the most famous civilians in American history before the Civil War, third only to Betsy Ross and Paul Revere. She {{inspired}} generations of African Americans struggling <b>for</b> <b>equality</b> and civil rights; she was praised by leaders across the political spectrum.|$|E

5|$|The NTFS {{file system}} used by recent {{versions}} of Windows stores the file with a UTC time stamp, but displays it corrected to local—or seasonal—time. However, the FAT filesystem commonly used on removable devices stores only the local time. Consequently, when a file is copied {{from the hard}} disk onto separate media, its time will be set to the current local time. If the time adjustment is changed, the timestamps of the original file and the copy will be different. The same effect can be observed when compressing and uncompressing files with some file archivers. It is the NTFS file that changes seen time. This effect {{should be kept in}} mind when trying to determine if a file is a duplicate of another, although there are other methods of comparing files <b>for</b> <b>equality</b> (such as using a checksum algorithm).|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, members {{helped to}} sponsor job training, reading enrichment, {{heritage}} and youth programs. By encouraging youth to improve math, science, and reading skills, the sorority continued {{a legacy of}} community service and pledged to enrich the lives of others. Financially, Alpha Kappa Alpha expanded funding for projects in 1953 through the creation and trademark of a fashion show called Fashionetta. Politically, ACHR continued lobbying <b>for</b> <b>equality</b> concerning civil rights during the 1950s and 1960s. According to Collier-Thomas, the ACHR drew attention to legislation concerning education, transportation, employment, and improving equality {{in the armed forces}} and public places. The ACHR participated in filing civil rights cases in amicus curiae with Bolling v. Sharpe and 1954's Brown v. Board of Education. However, as a whole, ACHR voted to dissolve operations in 1963.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, John Mauchly {{made the}} first mention of binary search {{as part of the}} Moore School Lectures, the first ever set of lectures {{regarding}} any computer-related topic. Every published binary search algorithm worked only for arrays whose length is one less than a power of two until 1960, when Derrick Henry Lehmer published a binary search algorithm that worked on all arrays. In 1962, Hermann Bottenbruch presented an ALGOL 60 implementation of binary search that placed the comparison <b>for</b> <b>equality</b> at the end, increasing the average number of iterations by one, but reducing to one the number of comparisons per iteration. The uniform binary search was presented to Donald Knuth in 1971 by A. K. Chandra of Stanford University and published in Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming. In 1986, Bernard Chazelle and Leonidas J. Guibas introduced fractional cascading as a method to solve numerous search problems in computational geometry.|$|E
