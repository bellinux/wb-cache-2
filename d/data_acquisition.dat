The mask will be needed at times when vegetation changes between <b>data</b> <b>acquisitions</b> are too large to allow for accurate estimation of forest parameters from Pol-InSAR data. In order to implement the mask, we implemented the mathematical model in C programming language and incorporated it into the parameter estimation program.
