5|$|The London Transport Museum is in a Victorian {{iron and}} glass {{building}} {{on the east side}} of the market square. It was designed as a dedicated <b>flower</b> <b>market</b> by William Rogers of William Cubitt and Company in 1871, and was first occupied by the museum in 1980. Previously the transport collection had been held at Syon Park and Clapham. The first parts of the collection were brought together at the beginning of the 20th century by the London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) when it began to preserve buses being retired from service. After the LGOC was taken over by the London Electric Railway (LER), the collection was expanded to include rail vehicles. It continued to expand after the LER became part of the London Passenger Transport Board in the 1930s and as the organisation passed through various successor bodies up to TfL, London's transport authority since 2000. The Covent Garden building has on display many examples of buses, trams, trolleybuses and rail vehicles from the 19th and 20th centuries as well as artefacts and exhibits related to the operation and marketing of passenger services and the impact that the developing transport network has had on the city and its population.|$|E

25|$|In 2015, {{however, the}} BMA, {{with support from}} the National Council for Peace and Order (Thailand's ruling {{military}} junta), began cracking down on street vendors in a bid to reclaim public space.

Nearly 15,000 vendors were evicted from 39 public areas in 2016.

That year {{was also the first}} to allow continuous opening for 36 hours from 11am on New Year's Eve to 11pm on New Year's Day. In addition, many cities had by-laws to allow some pubs to extend opening hours to midnight or 1am, whilst nightclubs had long been granted late licences to serve alcohol into the morning.

500|$|Tulips {{have been}} {{cultivated}} {{since at least}} the tenth century [...] in Persia. Tulip production has two main markets: cut flowers and bulb. The latter are used, in turn, to meet the demand for bulbs for parks, gardens and home use and, secondly, to provide the necessary bulbs for cut flower production. International trade in cut flowers has an approximate total value of 11 billion euros, which provides an indication of the economic importance of this activity. The main producer of tulip bulbs is the Netherlands, a country that accounts for 87% of the global cultivated area, with approximately 12,000 hectares. Other leading producers include Japan, France and Poland. Approximately ten other countries produce commercial tulips, largely for the domestic market. By contrast, the Netherlands is the leading international producer, to the extent of 4 billion bulbs per annum. Of these, 53% are used for the cut <b>flower</b> <b>market</b> and the remainder for the dry bulb market. Of the cut flowers, 57% are used for the domestic market in the Netherlands and the remainder exported.|$|E

Skip employs the use of an agency asset, Ziyad Abishi, who blows cover to a terrorist from the safe house. As he flees to inform his colleagues of their exposure, Ferris makes chase and kills him in such a place and manner that one might believe the death to be random. Salaam (via 'back channels') corroborates the acceptance of killing by those who remain at the safe house; and Ferris accuses Hoffman of running [...] "side operations" [...] which interfere and (at least) undermine operational integrity of primary operation and tells Hoffman to stop. While going to the hospital to receive rabies shots for bites suffered during the pursuit and elimination of the terrorist, Ferris meets a nurse named Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani), and he begins developing romantic feelings for her. The bombers strike again in an Amsterdam <b>flower</b> <b>market,</b> and kill at least 75 people.|$|E

[...] Between this market and the <b>flower</b> <b>market</b> in Tenancingo, State of Mexico, a 2007 study identified 131 species from 93 genera and 42 families, with orchidaceae best represented. There are five main types: Briopsida, Pteridopsida, Pinopsida, Magnoliopsida and Liliopsida, with the last two accounting for 93% of all species. However, these 131 species are {{only a fraction of}} the 434 native Mexican species which have been identified as having ornamental potential. 95% of the species sold are on no or little risk of extinction or need of any special protection. Exceptions to this are Coryphantha elephantidens, Nymphaea odorata, Tillandsia imperialis, Campyloneurum phyllitidis, Cupressus lusitanic and Barkeria scandens. Many of these species are taken directly from the wild with little or no monitoring. However, the vast majority of the flower and plant species sold at the market are not native to Mexico, a situation reflected in the rest of the country. One reason for this is that most of the plant sellers here do not know the taxonomy of the native plants.|$|E

There are several parks designated as forests such as the Bosque de Nativitas and the Bosque de San Luis Tlaxialtemaco. These are considered “areas of environmental value” by the city and established to counter some of the damage caused by urban sprawl in Xochimilco. These areas are open to the public but with minimal services such as picnic tables and horseback riding. The largest ecological area is the Xochimilco Ecological Reserve, inaugurated in 1993. It covers over 200 hectares and is filled with numerous plant and animal species that live or migrate here. The park also contains a bike path, thirty five athletic fields, a <b>flower</b> <b>market</b> and a visitor center. It is second in size only to Chapultepec Park.

This paper compares operational goals and performances of FloraHolland with Kunming, International <b>Flower</b> Auction <b>Market</b> (KIFA), which are two typical <b>flower</b> auction <b>markets</b> in the two countries. Finally, the paper gives five crucial advices for developing Chinese flower auction markets: transit of service strategies, cultivation of participants' network, establishing standardization, clever mechanism design and avoiding some factors impairing successful auction, and improving on operational performance continuously. Auction method will have a bright perspective in Chinese flowers trade in the future...|$|R
