40|$|The main {{objective}} of this bachelor thesis is an analysis <b>of</b> <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service attacks and the subsequent simulation <b>of</b> selected <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service attacks. To achieve {{the goal of this}} thesis, the initial point in theoretical part consists of the defined main terms related to <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service attacks. These terms are: cyber attacks, <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service attack and distributed <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service attacks. Further in this part of this thesis is defined description of the person who executes <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service attacks and motives, which lead the person to these acts. At the conclusion of the theoretical part of the thesis are mentioned several classifications <b>of</b> <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service attacks. The practical part of the thesis is then focused on the analysis of the most frequent <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service attacks and their possible defense. Furthemore, this section also includes a general defense against <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service attacks and the known examples <b>of</b> <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service attacks younger than two years.

40|$|<b>Denial</b> <b>of</b> {{services}} {{is an important}} practical consideration for key agreement protocols in any hostile environment such as the Internet. There are well-known models that consider the security of key agreement protocols, but <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service resistance is not considered as part of these models. Many protocols have been argued to be <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service-resistant, {{but in most cases}} the arguments are informal and it is not immediately clear how two <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service resistance definitions relate to each other. In this work we propose a formal definition <b>of</b> <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service resistance, a model for secure authenticated key agreement, and show how security and <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service resistance can be considered in a common framework. Our model accommodates a variety of techniques for achieving <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service resistance, and we describe one such technique by exhibiting a <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service-resistant secure authenticated key agreement protocol...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service problem, {{in the context}} of services provided over a network, and contributes to improved techniques for modelling, detecting, and preventing <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service attacks against these services. While the majority <b>of</b> currently employed <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service attacks aim to pre-emptively consume the network bandwidth of victims, a significant amount of research effort is already being directed at this problem. This research is instead concerned with addressing the inevitable migration <b>of</b> <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service attacks up the protocol stack to the application layer. Of particular interest is the <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service resistance of key establishment protocols (security protocols that enable an initiator and responder to mutually authenticate and establish cryptographic keys for establishing a secure communications channel), which owing to the computationally intensive activities they perform, are particularly vulnerable to attack. Given the preponderance of wireless networking technologies this research hasalso investigated <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service and its detection in IEEE 802. 11 standards based networks. Specific outcomes of this research include: - investigation of the modelling and application of techniques to improve the <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service resistance of key establishment protocols; - a proposal for enhancements to an existing modelling framework to accommodate coordinated attackers; - design <b>of</b> a new <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service resistant key establishment protocol for securing signalling messages in next generation, mobile IPv 6 networks; - a comprehensive survey <b>of</b> <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service attacks in IEEE 802. 11 wireless networks; discovery <b>of</b> a significant <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service vulnerability in the clear channel assessment procedure implemented by the medium access control layer of IEEE 802. 11 compliant devices; and - design of a novel, specification-based intrusion detection system for detecting <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service attacks in IEEE 802. 11 wireless networks...|$|R

40|$|<b>Denial</b> <b>of</b> service {{resilience}} is {{an important}} practical consideration for key agreement protocols in any hostile environment such as the Internet. There are well-known models that consider the security of key agreement protocols, but <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service resilience is not considered as part of these models. Many protocols have been argued to be denial-of-service-resilient, only to be subsequently broken or shown ineffective. In this work we propose a formal definition <b>of</b> <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service resilience, a model for secure authenticated key agreement, and show how security and <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> service resilience can be considered in a common framework, with a particular focus on client puzzles.

40|$|In {{the formal}} study <b>of</b> <b>glare,</b> a major {{distinction}} {{has been made}} between subjective and objective effects <b>of</b> <b>glare</b> (referred to as discomfort glare and disability glare, respectively). Recently, both anecdotal reports and formal experiments have indicated that headlamp size and spectral power distribution affect discomfort glare, but no assessment {{has been made of}} whether these two factors also affect disability <b>glare.</b> Models <b>of</b> disability <b>glare</b> suggest that they should not. The present experiment was designed to provide empirical evidence about this issue. Subjects were presented with glare stimuli that varied in size (0. 3 or 0. 6 degrees of visual angle) and spectral power distribution (tungsten-halogen or high-intensity discharge). Discomfort glare was measured by numerical ratings of subjective discomfort. Disability glare was measured by determining the luminance threshold for detecting a pedestrian silhouette presented near the glare source. Spectral power distribution affected discomfort glare, although, in contrast to previous studies, which had shown small but statistically significant effects, size did not affect discomfort glare. Neither variable affected disability glare. These results indicate that, for size and spectral power distribution, effects on discomfort glare do not necessarily imply effects on disability <b>glare.</b> The <b>fact</b> that small, high-intensity discharge lamps do not seem to cause any special problems with disability glare under the conditions of this experiment is encouraging, particularly because disability glare is likely to have greater effects on safety than discomfort glare. However, given the importance of the issue, further studies <b>of</b> disability <b>glare</b> would be valuable. Also, even if effects on discomfort glare are not critical for safety, they are still of practical interest because driver comfort is important in itself, and they are of scientific interest because they have not been explained...|$|R
