5|$|Wallis's {{father died}} {{shortly after her}} birth {{and she and her}} widowed mother were partly {{supported}} by their wealthier relatives. <b>Her</b> <b>first</b> <b>marriage,</b> to U.S. naval officer Win Spencer, was punctuated by periods of separation and eventually ended in divorce.

5|$|Alice and Hugh I {{married in}} the first half of 1210, with Alice {{receiving}} the County of Jaffa as the agreed upon dowry. Alice's sister, Philippa, married Erard of Ramerupt, who laid claim to Champagne and Brie on Philippa's behalf in 1213. Blanche of Navarre soon approached the Holy See to demand an investigation into the validity of the second and third marriage of Alice's and Philippa's mother, stating that <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>marriage</b> to Humphrey IV of Toron had not been canonically annulled. The inquiry conducted by Cardinal Robert of Courçon at the pope's order concluded that both Humphrey IV and Isabella I had protested against the annulment of their marriage, which suggested that Isabella I's two subsequent marriages were unlawful. However, the Holy See did not complete the investigation and thus the legitimacy of Alice (and her sister) was not questioned.|$|E
5|$|Following King Henry I's {{death in}} 1135, the {{succession}} was disputed between the Henry's nephews—Stephen and his elder brother, Theobald II, Count of Champagne—and Henry's surviving legitimate child Matilda, usually {{known as the}} Empress Matilda because of <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>marriage</b> to the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry V. Matilda's brother, and King Henry's only legitimate son, William died in 1120, leaving Matilda as Henry's only legitimate offspring. After Matilda was widowed in 1125, she returned to England, where her father married her to Geoffrey, Count of Anjou. All the magnates of England and Normandy were required to declare fealty to Matilda as Henry's heir, but when Henry I died in 1135, Stephen rushed to England and had himself crowned before either Theobald or Matilda could react. The Norman barons accepted Stephen as Duke of Normandy, and Theobald acquiesced to his brother's usurpation.|$|E

In 1998, they opened a {{motorcycle}} shop called Spookee Custom Cycles, which made motorcycles for other NFL players such as Kimo von Oelhoffen, Darnay Scott, Bradford Banta, and Dan Wilkinson. The couple later divorced. On June 25, 2011, Miceli married Alan Jonason, a Sergeant Major in the United States Army, in Memphis, Tennessee. The wedding took place at Graceland, and was broadcast over the internet for over 22,000 fans.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{marriage}} of Mary's parents was in jeopardy. Disappointed {{at the lack of}} a male heir, and eager to remarry, Henry attempted to have his marriage to Catherine annulled, but Pope Clement VII refused his request. Henry claimed, citing biblical passages (Leviticus 20:21), that his marriage to Catherine was unclean because she was the widow of his brother Arthur (Mary's uncle). Catherine claimed that her marriage to Arthur was never consummated and so was not a valid marriage. <b>Her</b> <b>first</b> <b>marriage</b> had been annulled by a previous pope, Julius II, on that basis. Clement may have been reluctant to act because he was influenced by Charles V, Catherine's nephew and Mary's former betrothed, whose troops had surrounded and occupied Rome in the War of the League of Cognac.|$|E
5|$|The {{couple has}} three children. The eldest is Lindesfarne Dewclaw, an English {{hedgehog}} daughter Kevin adopted {{during his first}} marriage. The second eldest child is Rudy, Kell's son from <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>marriage</b> to a fox. Rudy, a talented artist, once challenged Kevin for the position of alpha male, unable to accept a rabbit {{as head of the}} household and as his stepfather. He has since matured and has {{come to terms with the}} marriage. The youngest child is Coney, a carnivorous rabbit and their only child by birth. Although only five years old, she is a capable hunter, though Kevin's mother, Dorothy, keeps trying to make her into an herbivore, as well having an artistic streak like her half-brother.|$|E

5|$|Victoria's {{father was}} Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, the fourth {{son of the}} reigning King of the United Kingdom, George III. Until 1817, Edward's niece, Princess Charlotte of Wales, was the only {{legitimate}} grandchild of George III. Her death in 1817 precipitated a succession crisis that brought pressure on the Duke of Kent and his unmarried brothers to marry and have children. In 1818 he married Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, a widowed German princess with two children—Carl (1804–1856) and Feodora (1807–1872)—by <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>marriage</b> to the Prince of Leiningen. Her brother Leopold was Princess Charlotte's widower. The Duke and Duchess of Kent's only child, Victoria, was born at 4.15a.m. on 24May 1819 at Kensington Palace in London.|$|E
5|$|Warenne offered King John 500 {{marks for}} licence to marry Melisent, {{the widow of}} Richard de Mountfichet, lord of the manor of Stansted in Essex. Warenne's only {{surviving}} child and sole-heiress was his daughter, Beatrice, whom he married to Doun Bardolf, the holder of a one-half moiety of the feudal barony of Shelford in Nottinghamshire. Beatrice married secondly Ralph, and thirdly Hubert de Burgh. Beatrice had a son, William Bardolf, by <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>marriage,</b> who became the eventual heir of his maternal grandfather. Bardolf's rights to the barony were controlled by Beatrice's third husband, who did not relinquish them {{until his death in}} 1243.|$|E
5|$|After Henry I's {{death in}} 1135, the {{succession}} was disputed as the king's only legitimate son, William, {{had died in}} 1120. The main contenders were the king's nephews, Stephen, Count of Boulogne and his elder brother Theobald II, Count of Champagne, and his surviving legitimate daughter, Matilda, usually known as the Empress Matilda because of <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>marriage</b> to the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry V. After Matilda was widowed in 1125, {{she returned to her}} father in England, who then secured her marriage to Geoffrey, Count of Anjou.

The Norman barons accepted Stephen as Duke of Normandy, and Theobald contented himself with his possessions in France. But Matilda was less patient: she secured the support of the king of Scotland, David I, her maternal uncle, and the support of her half-brother Robert, Earl of Gloucester, an illegitimate son of HenryI, in 1138.|$|E

5|$|After having Lord Rivers arrested, the two dukes {{moved to}} Stony Stratford where Richard {{informed}} the young king of a plot aimed at denying him {{his role as}} Protector whose perpetrators had been dealt with. He proceeded to escort the young king to London where they entered on 4 May displaying the carriages of weapons Earl Rivers had taken with his 2000 man army. Richard first accommodated Edward in the Bishop's apartments, then, on the Duke of Buckingham's suggestion, in the Royal Apartments of the Tower of London where kings customarily awaited their coronation. On hearing the news of her brother's arrest on 30 April, the Dowager Queen fled to sanctuary in Westminster Abbey together with her son by <b>her</b> <b>first</b> <b>marriage</b> Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset, her five daughters and her youngest son Richard, Duke of York.
