40|$|In modern urban society, {{house has}} become rare {{resource}}. Under space of city limited, house resource in short situation, its distribution inevitably causes {{a variety of}} social conflict and inequitable problems. There are three housing problems closely linked with urbanization course, as the ubiquitous economic social concern of countries all over the world. First, the shortage of the quantity of the house. Second, the quality of the house does not fulfill requirements. Third, the polarization on the <b>house</b> <b>distribution.</b> China is in the experimental period of the housing system reform at present, and faces the severe social pressure. So it is vital to set up and perfect the housing policy after canceling welfare-oriented public <b>housing</b> <b>distribution</b> system.

40|$|Economists devote {{considerable}} {{effort to}} the analysis of various forms of nonprice rationing. These analyses generally disregard forces that act to foil rationing schemes. Even with a commodity that seems to be easy to control, however, in a system with extensive rationing experience, nonprice rationing schemes can be circumvented. This thesis is examined for the case of <b>housing</b> <b>distribution</b> in the U. S. S. R. utilizing the data from a survey of recent Soviet emigres. It is shown that administrative rationing of Soviet urban housing is partially replaced by market forces acting usually through the second economy. Copyright 1988 by MIT Press. ...|$|R

In order to do this, a new theory of class is articulated, which is then used to throw new light on the nature of class-tenure relations...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{two aspects}} of housing market price dynamics. Firstly, whether the spatial pattern of house prices in a metropolitan housing market converge or diverge over time and secondly, whether suburbs with relatively low (high) house prices 20 years ago continue to occupy the same relative position in the <b>house</b> price <b>distribution.</b> The empirical work uses a property transaction database for Melbourne to examine the changing <b>distribution</b> of suburban <b>house</b> prices over a nearly 20 -year period (1990 - 2009) that spans two housing cycles. We focus on convergence measures that use Melbourne submarket-based repeat sale house price indexes as a unit of measurement. We find that house prices diverge, and so the gap between low-priced submarkets and high-priced submarkets is increasing. A second key result is that low-priced submarkets typically remain {{at the low end}} of the <b>house</b> price <b>distribution,</b> because their rates of appreciation fall short of those at the upper end of the <b>house</b> price <b>distribution.</b> The geography of house price dynamics suggests that the price gradient with respect to distance from the central business district is becoming steeper...|$|R

30|$|The {{land use}} {{diversity}} or land use mix {{is measured by}} the job-population balance (jobpop) and degree of job mixing (jobmix) to reflect the relative balance between jobs and population and diversity of jobs, respectively [43]. Job-population balance represents the degree of self-sufficiency achieved in a community and is used to measure land use mix in many studies and applications [8, 44, 45]. In a compact land use development policy, it is hoped to make jobs and <b>housing</b> <b>distributions</b> balanced by planning the residential and employment areas within close communities. Job-population balance at the regional level is defined as the ratio of employment to population, as expressed by Eq. (2) [46].|$|R
