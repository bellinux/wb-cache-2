40|$|We <b>ink-jet</b> <b>print</b> a {{blend of}} 6, 13 -bis(triisopropyl-silylethynyl) {{pentacene}} and polystyrene as the active layer for flexible circuits. The discrete <b>ink-jet</b> <b>printed</b> transistors exhibit a saturation mobility of 0. 5 cm 2 V - 1 s- 1. The relative spread in transistor characteristics can be very large. This spread {{is due to the}} morphology of the TIPS-PEN crystals, and is difficult to control using inkjet printing. Here we apply a novel circuitry design to minimize the probability of differences between the transistors. We include up to four transistors under the same <b>ink-jet</b> <b>printed</b> deposit. With the new design, we demonstrate unipolar circuitry building blocks such as inverters, NANDs and 19 -stage ring-oscillators. Additionally, we integrate almost 300 TFTs, on a surface area of 34 mm 2 of plastic foil, for 8 -bit RFID transponder circuits. © 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} patterning fine line interconnections over non-planar surfaces and introduces {{the idea of using}} holographic masks for more challenging geometries. Design/methodology/approach – A photolithographic method for achieving grossly non-planar interconnects is described. The patterning of electrical interconnections onto the piezo-electric actuators of an <b>ink-jet</b> <b>print</b> head is used as an example. Uniform coverage of the substrate is achieved using an electro-depositable photoresist. The required pattern is transferred via a custom-designed chrome-on-glass mask using a standard mask aligner. Findings – Large arrays of 100 ?µm-pitch electrical interconnections were successfully deposited onto 500 ?µm-high high piezo-electric actuators. It was necessary to modify the shapes of the line segments on the mask in order to compensate for diffractive line broadening. For more extreme 3 D geometries it becomes necessary to consider the use of holographic masks. Originality/value – Printed circuit boards and semiconductor wafers are nominally flat and traditional lithographic processes have been developed accordingly. However, future microelectronic packaging schemes and microsystems may require patterning to be achieved on grossly non-planar surfaces. We have demonstrated that this can be achieved on <b>ink-jet</b> <b>print</b> heads using photolithography and point to the research necessary to enable it to be realised on more extreme non-planar substrates...|$|R
