25|$|The {{effects of}} winter {{diminish}} {{by the first}} week of March. The hot summer season commences in mid-April. This period is marked by occasional showers with hail storms and squalls that cause extensive damage to crops. The winds remain dry and warm during the last week of March, commencing the <b>harvest</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sometimes (e.g., in irrigated, {{submerged}} rice fields), a form {{of temporary}} drainage is required whereby the drainage system is allowed to function only on certain occasions (e.g., during the <b>harvest</b> <b>period).</b> If allowed to function continuously, excessive quantities of water would be lost. Such a system is therefore called a checked, or controlled, drainage system.|$|E
2500|$|Rural {{workers are}} {{dependent}} on agricultural wage labor, especially in coffee and cotton. Only a small fraction hold permanent jobs. Most are migrants who follow crops during the <b>harvest</b> <b>period</b> and find other work during the off-season. The [...] "lower" [...] peasants are typically smallholders without sufficient land to sustain a family; they also join the harvest labor force. The [...] "upper" [...] peasants have sufficient resources to be economically independent. They produce enough surplus, beyond their personal needs, {{to allow them to}} participate in the national and world markets.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the impact of botanical origin and <b>harvesting</b> <b>period</b> on carbon stable isotope ratio (13 C/ 12 C), colour intensity (CI), radical scavenging activity (%RSA), P and Sn content of Greek unifloral honeys. Thus, twenty-four honey samples were collected during <b>harvesting</b> <b>periods</b> 2011 – 2012 and 2012 – 2013, from four different regions in Greece. 13 C/ 12 C ratios and minerals were determined using isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) and inductively coupled plasma optical–emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), respectively. CI and %RSA were measured using spectrophotometric assays. Results showed that only 13 C/ 12 C values and %RSA were affected by both botanical origin and <b>harvesting</b> <b>period</b> (P <  0. 05). Applying then chemometric analyses to the collected data set, honeys were correctly classified according to honey type (correct classification rate 87. 5 % and 79. 2 % using the original and cross-validation method, respectively). The use of different origin parameters has the potential to aid in honey authentication...|$|R
2500|$|Farmers need to {{be better}} educated {{on the subject of}} CBSD, {{including}} cause, diagnosis and disease spread. [...] The most obvious symptom of the disease is the cassava root rot, and farmers are inclined to believe that too much water causes the rotting rather than the virus. The identification of the foliar symptoms is important, because farmers can get a more accurate yield expectation without waiting for the <b>harvest</b> <b>period.</b> [...] Also, awareness of tolerant varieties can be promoted. [...] It is suggested that workshops be held for researchers, so that they are aware of new diagnostics.|$|E
2500|$|On August 7, 1932, the Decree {{about the}} Protection of Socialist Property proclaimed that the {{punishment}} for theft of kolkhoz or cooperative property was the death sentence, which [...] "under extenuating circumstances" [...] could {{be replaced by}} at least ten years of incarceration. With what some called the Law of Spikelets ("Закон о колосках"), peasants (including children) who hand-collected or gleaned grain in the collective fields after the harvest were arrested for damaging the state grain production. Martin Amis writes in Koba the Dread that 125,000 sentences were passed for this particular offense in the bad <b>harvest</b> <b>period</b> from August 1932 to December 1933.|$|E
2500|$|Sugarcane is a tropical, [...] {{perennial}} {{grass that}} forms lateral shoots {{at the base}} to produce multiple stems, typically [...] high and about [...] in diameter. The stems grow into cane stalk, which when mature constitutes around 75% of the entire plant. A mature stalk is typically composed of 11–16% fiber, 12–16% soluble sugars, 2–3% nonsugars, and 63–73% water. A sugarcane crop is sensitive to the climate, soil type, irrigation, fertilizers, insects, disease control, varieties, and the <b>harvest</b> <b>period.</b> The average yield of cane stalk is [...] per year. However, this figure can vary between 30 and 180 tonnes per hectare depending on knowledge and crop management approach used in sugarcane cultivation. Sugarcane is a cash crop, {{but it is also}} used as livestock fodder.|$|E
40|$|A {{questionnaire}} {{survey was conducted}} in five different villages in Mpumalanga Province. Hundred and fifty traditional healers were interviewed. The aim of the survey was to record and document indigenous knowledge held by the traditional healers on wild ginger and eight other popular plants used by them. The healing properties of wild ginger as perceived by traditional healers, ranged from healing coughs, colds, flu, hysteria, malaria and menstrual disorder, to protection against lightning. Majority (77 %) {{said that there was}} no difference in medicinal value between cultivated and those grown in the wild. The majority of the traditional healers (72 %) said they would appreciate proper training on how to domesticate these plants. Traditional healers do not have professional knowledge and skills to produce theses medicinal plants. Therefore training is crucial to impart these skills. The income category of traditional healers ranged from less than R 200 to a maximum of R 3000. Traditional healers received as few as 1 to 5 patients per day. The consultation cost ranged from R 20 to more than R 95. People who gathered plants for traditional healers ranged from 1 to 10 depending on the popularity of the traditional healer and the size of his/ her surgery. An experiment was carried out at Johannesburg Center for the disabled (JOCOD), Lenasia, South of Johannesburg, in a plastic tunnel and under a shade net. The objective of the experiment was to determine the effect of using a tunnel or a shade net on the yield of rhizome and to determine the effect of different <b>harvesting</b> <b>periods</b> on rhizome yield of wild ginger. The treatments were four in number, namely; two growing structures (tunnel and shade net) and two <b>harvesting</b> <b>periods.</b> On the effect of <b>harvesting</b> <b>periods</b> on yield, although there was no significant differences in the number of enlarged roots harvested between the first <b>harvesting</b> <b>period</b> and the second <b>harvesting</b> <b>period,</b> the number of roots tended to be higher during the first <b>harvesting</b> <b>period</b> compared to the second <b>harvesting</b> <b>period.</b> There was a significant difference in the number of rhizomes between the first and the second <b>harvesting</b> <b>periods.</b> On the effect of growth structure on yield of wild ginger, the number of enlarged roots was significantly higher from plants grown in a tunnel compared with those grown in a shade net. There was a significant difference in rhizome circumference between plants grown in a plastic tunnel and those grown in a shade net. There were interactions between the harvesting date and growth structure for fresh enlarged root mass. Fresh mass of enlarged roots of wild ginger was greater during the first harvesting date than during the second harvesting date for plants grown in a plastic tunnel. For small scale or resource poor farmers, herbalists and traditional healers who wish to grow wild ginger under protection, it is better to grow wild ginger in a plastic tunnel than under a shade net, probably because wild ginger performs well in warm conditions. The plastic tunnels have a tendency of maintaining warm temperatures during winter months. Early harvesting of wild ginger at the end of June 28 / 06 than harvesting in September. This could be because wild ginger grows rapidly throughout the summer season and in winter, the growth rate drops (dormant stage) making early winter the right time to harvest.

At the end of the research it was found out that when the rate of barley increased in the mixture plants became taller, herbage yield and dry matter yield increased and crude protein yield decreased. The highest herbage and dry matter yield were obtained between single barley and the mixture of 25 % vetch + 75 % barley, pre-blooming and 50 % blooming periods the highest value of crude protein yield was obtained in the mixture of 75 % vetch+ 25 % barley. <b>Harvesting</b> <b>period</b> didn`t effect the plant length and crude protein yield...|$|R
