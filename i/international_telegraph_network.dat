50|$|The {{newspaper}} {{industry and}} <b>international</b> <b>telegraph</b> <b>networks</b> mutually facilitated each other. As the {{supply and demand}} of newspaper industry rapidly increased in nineteenth century, news agencies were established successively. The French Havas Agency was founded in 1835, the German agency Wolffin 1849 and the British Reuters in 1851. These three European agencies, which started to operate internationally, were all subsidized by their respective governments.|$|R
40|$|The global {{telecommunications}} sector, and its associ- ated policy environment, {{has been}} subject to remark- able upheaval in recent decades. Throughout these reconfigurations of the very backbone of the global communications network, one institution has man- aged to survive, evolve and continue functioning: the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Originally established in 1865, it emerged as the out- come of an agreement between twenty European states, and {{was set up to}} ensure standardisation of <b>international</b> <b>telegraph</b> <b>networks</b> between its signa- tory members. However, nearly 150 years after its conception and over sixty years since it became a UN agency, the ITU {{plays an important role in}} the international telecommunications regime. However, the ITU has faced challenges from global develop- ments as its core tasks have seemingly dissipated into the ether. These questions are outlined below in this article, which will first provide a brief summary of the ITU’s operations and will then go on to describe the evol- ution of the telecommunications sector in recent years. Then the article will describe how these devel- opments have challenged the ITU’s role as a key player in the governance of the international tele- communications regime. The article will end with a brief description of the prospects for the ITU in the future governance of international telecommunica- tions, especially looking towards its focus on devel- oping countries...|$|R
50|$|The name Cable Bay {{arose from}} New Zealand's first {{overseas}} cable link, to Australia, which was opened on 21 February 1876. The <b>international</b> <b>telegraph</b> cable established {{a connection with}} the world-wide <b>telegraph</b> <b>network</b> via Sydney. The cable came ashore into a timber building, continuing through a cedar-topped cable, a stone-cemented passage and underground to the cable house. From the cable station, messages were sent to Nelson via telegraph wire. This new service meant communications to Europe only took four days instead of {{up to six months}} for letters. With a population of about 30, the cable station was a self-contained village.|$|R

50|$|David Ames Wells (1890), who was {{a leading}} {{authority}} {{on the effects of}} technology on the economy in the late 19th century, gave many examples of creative destruction (without using the term) brought about by improvements in steam engine efficiency, shipping, the <b>international</b> <b>telegraph</b> <b>network,</b> and agricultural mechanization.|$|E

50|$|There {{were several}} so called {{depressions}} {{during the period}} that were actually profit recessions. Many businesses suffered, such as warehousing, especially in the London area, due to improvements in transportation, like efficient steam shipping {{and the opening of}} the Suez Canal, and also because of the <b>international</b> <b>telegraph</b> <b>network.</b> Displaced workers found new employment in the expanding economy as real incomes grew.|$|E

50|$|Recent Economic Changes and Their Effect on the Production and Distribution of Wealth and Well-Being of Society (1891) is a {{frequently}} cited reference for U.S. economic {{history of the}} late 19th century and is available in modern reprints. It is {{an account of the}} dramatic changes in the world economy transitioning into the Second Industrial Revolution in which Wells documented many of the changes in trade, such as triple expansion steam shipping, railroads, the effect of the <b>international</b> <b>telegraph</b> <b>network</b> and the opening of the Suez Canal. Wells also discussed the Long Depression and many causes of the great advances in productivity of the preceding 20 years. Wells noted that many of the government inquires on the “depression of prices” (deflation) found various reasons such as the scarcity of gold and silver. Wells showed that the U.S money supply, especially the amount of gold and silver, actually rose significantly during the deflation. Wells pointed out that deflation only lowered the cost of goods that benefited from improved methods of manufacturing and transportation. Goods produced by craftsmen did not decrease in value, nor did many services, and the cost of labor actually increased. Also, deflation did not occur in countries that did not have modern manufacturing, transportation and communications.|$|E
