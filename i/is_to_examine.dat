5|$|Additionally, {{there can}} be {{confusion}} between the various water hemlock species and poison hemlock (Conium maculatum) as the common name hemlock is applied to both Cicuta and Conium maculatum. Both are poisonous and can be differentiated by differences in their root structure. Water hemlock has a branched root systems with tubules, while poison hemlock has a single tap root. Another reliable method to identify water hemlock <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> the leaf veins. Water Hemlock is unique in the Apiaceae family in that it has leaf veins which terminate in the notches between the leaf tips, rather than extend {{to the tip of}} the leaf, as is found in the leaf structure of other members of this family.|$|E
5|$|Another {{approach}} to brain function <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> {{the consequences of}} damage to specific brain areas. Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier, the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the effects of strokes {{and other types of}} brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function. Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret. In animal studies, most commonly involving rats, it is possible to use electrodes or locally injected chemicals to produce precise patterns of damage and then examine the consequences for behavior.|$|E
5|$|Periyar's {{philosophy}} of self-respect {{was based on}} his image of an ideal world and a universally accepted one. His philosophy preaches that human actions {{should be based on}} rational thinking. Further, the outcome of the natural instinct of human beings <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> every object and every action and even nature with a spirit of inquiry, and to refuse to submit to anything irrational as equivalent to slavery. Thus, the {{philosophy of}} self-respect taught that human actions should be guided by reason, right and wrong should follow from rational thinking and conclusions drawn from reason should be respected under circumstances. Freedom means respect to thoughts and actions considered 'right' by human beings on the basis of 'reason'. There is not much difference between 'freedom' and 'self-respect'.|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, many East Germans cut the coat of arms out of their flags, as Hungarians had done in 1956 and as Romanians would soon do during {{the fall of}} Ceaușescu. The {{widespread}} act of removing the coat of arms from the East German flag implied the plain black-red-gold tricolour as symbol for a united and democratic Germany. Finally, on 3 October 1990, as the area of the German Democratic Republic was absorbed into the Federal Republic of Germany, the black-red-gold tricolour became the flag of a reunified Germany. In 1998, the Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship was formed. The duty of this organisation, directly responsible to the federal government, <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> the consequences of the former East German regime. As its logo, the foundation used an East German flag with the Communist coat of arms cut out.|$|E

A third task <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> selected characteristics of articles addressing African American issues. The final task <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> selected characteristics of authors addressing African American issues in study journals during the research period. Survey research and content analysis techniques <b>were</b> utilized <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> a total of 1715 articles for the study period. Of these, only 47 (or 2. 7 %) articles addressing African American issues were published. Measure of Central Tendency, Measures of Variability and Frequency Analysis <b>were</b> employed <b>to</b> analyze the data. Major findings indicate that: (1) policy statements of study journals emphasized research, practice and procedures; (2) authors addressing African American issues were males and affiliated with a majority/white institution; (3) four (4) out of the 47 authors were affiliated with UNCF and HBCU member institutions, and (4) principally addressed in studies were African American adults and issues of Black pathology and education/ miseducation. Implications for African American research, Black scholars and Black counselors are included. Limitations and directions for future research conclude this study...|$|R

25|$|Box turtles are North American turtles of {{the genus}} Terrapene. Although box turtles are superficially similar to {{tortoises}} in terrestrial habits and overall appearance, they are actually members of the American pond turtle family (Emydidae). The twelve taxa which are distinguished in the genus are distributed over four species. They are largely characterized by having a domed shell, which is hinged at the bottom, allowing the animal to close its shell tightly to escape predators. Box turtles have become popular pets, although their needs in captivity are complex. The females usually have yellowish, brown eyes and the males usually have red or orange eyes, but the most reliable manner to distinguish males from females <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> the plastron: on males there is a concave area centered beneath the hinge.|$|E
25|$|Shrimp of the infraorder Caridea {{are more}} closely related to {{lobsters}} and crabs than they are {{to the members of the}} sub-order Dendrobranchiata (prawns). Biologists distinguish these two groups based on differences in their gill structures. The gill structure is lamellar in carideans but branching in dendrobranchiates. The easiest practical way to separate true shrimp from dendrobranchiates <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>examine</b> the second abdominal segment. The second segment of a carideans overlaps both the first and the third segment, while the second segment of a dendrobranchiate overlaps only the third segment. They also differ in that carideans typically have two pairs of chelae (claws), while dendrobranchiates have three. A third group, the Stenopodidea, contains around 70 species and differs from the other groups in that the third pairs of legs is greatly enlarged.|$|E
