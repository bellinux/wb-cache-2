5|$|While caddisflies in {{the wild}} {{construct}} their cases out of twigs, sand, aquatic plants, and rocks, the French artist Hubert Duprat makes art by providing wild caddisflies with precious stones and other materials. He collected caddisfly larvae from the wild {{and put them in}} climate-controlled tanks. He removes the larvae from their original cases and adds precious and semi-precious items such as grains of gold <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank.</b> The larvae then build new cases out of precious items, creating a unique form of artwork. The resulting works are sold across the world.|$|E
5|$|GoldenEye was {{the last}} film of special effects {{supervisor}} Derek Meddings, to whom the film was dedicated. Meddings' major contribution was miniatures. It {{was also the first}} Bond film to use computer generated imagery. Among the model effects are most external shots of Severnaya, the scene where Janus' train crashes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank,</b> and the lake which hides the satellite dish, since the producers could not find a round lake in Puerto Rico. The climax in the satellite dish used scenes in Arecibo, a model built by Meddings' team and scenes shot with stuntmen in Britain.|$|E
5|$|The script {{called for}} the probe to {{vaporize}} the Earth's oceans, generating heavy cloud cover. While effects cinematographer Don Dow {{wanted to go to}} sea and record plumes of water created by exploding detonating cords in the water, the team decided to create the probe's climatic effect in another way after a government fishing agency voiced concerns for the welfare of marine life in the area. The team used a combination of baking soda and cloud tank effects; the swirling mist created by the water-filled tank was shot on black velvet, and color and dynamic swirls were added by injecting paint <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank.</b> These shots were composited onto a painting of the Earth along with overlaid lightning effects, created by double-exposing lights as they moved across the screen.|$|E

5|$|Chaplin {{then shot}} the {{sequence}} where the Little Tramp first meets the millionaire and prevents him from committing suicide. During filming, Henry Clive suddenly {{decided that he}} did not want to jump <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> of cold water in the scene, causing Chaplin to storm off the set and fire Clive. He was quickly replaced by Harry Myers, who Chaplin had known while under contract at Keystone Studios. Chaplin finished shooting the sequence on July 29, 1929 with exteriors at Pasadena Bridge. Chaplin then shot a sequence that was eventually cut from the film involving the Little Tramp attempting to retrieve a stick that was stuck in a wall. The scene included a young Charles Lederer; Chaplin later praised the scene, but insisted that it needed to be cut. He then continued filming the scenes with the millionaire until September 29, 1929.|$|E
5|$|The {{novelisation}} and the screenplay, {{although both}} written by Wood, are somewhat different. In the novelisation, SMERSH is still active and after James Bond. Their role begins during the pre-title. After the mysterious death of Fekkish, SMERSH appears yet again, this time capturing and torturing Bond for {{the whereabouts of}} the microfilm that retains plans for a submarine tracking system (Bond escapes after killing two of the interrogators). The appearance of SMERSH conflicts {{with a number of}} Bond stories, including the film The Living Daylights (1987), in which a character remarks that SMERSH has been defunct for over 20 years. It also differs from the latter half of Fleming's Bond novels in which SMERSH {{is said to have been}} put out of operation. Members of SMERSH from the novelisation include Amasova and her lover Sergei Borzov as well as Colonel-General Niktin, a character from Fleming's novel From Russia, with Love who has since become the head of SMERSH. In the book, Jaws remains attached to the magnet that Bond dips <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank,</b> as opposed to the film where Bond releases Jaws into the water.|$|E
25|$|Septic tanks {{have to be}} pumped {{periodically}} by {{a vacuum}} truck to eliminate non reducing solids. Failure to pump a septic tank can cause overflow that damages the leach field, and contaminates ground water. Septic tanks may also require some lifestyle changes, such as not using garbage disposals, minimizing fluids flushed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank,</b> and minimizing nondigestible solids flushed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank.</b> For example, septic safe toilet paper is recommended.|$|E

2500|$|Made from {{a bucket}} with a sloped floor, the {{receptacle}} had {{connections to the}} two extra fuel tanks, and at Spaatz's signal Solter opened the valve. Fuel flowed by gravity <b>into</b> <b>the</b> bucket at [...] per minute and then <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tanks,</b> where it was then pumped by hand <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wing <b>tanks</b> by Hooe. Food, mail, tools, spare parts, and other supplies were also passed by rope in the same fashion.|$|R
50|$|Public tanks {{used for}} bathing {{purposes}} should be thrown open, after separate cisterns {{are attached to}} them or portions of them are walled off, where people could wash their clothes, etc. before getting <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> for bath.|$|R
25|$|After {{the pieces}} are removed from the kiln and fully cooled, they are {{inspected}} for cracks or other defects. Then, the flushing mechanism may be installed on a one-piece toilet. On a two-piece toilet with a separate tank, the flushing mechanism may only be placed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank,</b> with final assembly at installation.|$|E
25|$|Theories differ {{as to how}} {{the water}} entered the tank. At the time, workers were {{cleaning}} out a clogged pipe with water about 400 feet from the tank. They claimed that they were not told to isolate the tank with a pipe slip-blind plate. The operators assumed that owing to bad maintenance and leaking valves, it was possible for the water to leak <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{oxidizer}} {{tank and}} CTN are bolted {{together at the}} main valve bulkhead, which is integrated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank.</b> There are O-rings at the interface to prevent leakage; this is the main potential leak path in the engine. The ignition system, main control valve, and injector are mounted on the valve bulkhead, inside the tank. Slosh baffles are also mounted on this bulkhead. Because the oxidizer is stored under pressure, no pump is required.|$|E
50|$|First, <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> must be 'inerted' to {{eliminate}} the risk of explosion. An inert gas plant burns diesel in air to produce a mixture of gases (typically less than 5% O2 and about 13% CO2 plus N2). This is blown <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> until <b>the</b> oxygen level is below 4%.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> tip <b>tanks</b> provide {{additional}} fuel capacity to enable longer times aloft. A jet pump installed in each tip <b>tank</b> transfers fuel <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wing <b>tanks.</b> Fuel can also flow via the flapper check valves <b>into</b> <b>the</b> wing <b>tanks,</b> but <b>the</b> {{lower half of}} the fuel in <b>the</b> tip <b>tanks</b> must be transferred with the jet pump.|$|R

25|$|The water {{within the}} {{simulator}} was temperature controlled, continuously recirculated and filtered. Special systems were integrated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> for underwater audio and video, pressure-suit environmental control and emergency rescue and treatment. Life support was simultaneously provided by these systems {{for up to}} four pressure-suited subjects. Additional systems included data acquisition and recording, underwater lighting, special underwater pneumatic and electrical power operations of motor, valves, controls, and indicators that required for high fidelity and functional engineering mockups and trainers.|$|E
25|$|Once in the tank, {{the wider}} cross {{sectional}} area of the tank reduces the downward superficial velocity of the mixture, allowing mineral-laden bubbles to disengage from the liquid and rise to the surface as they would in a conventional cell, where they form the froth. The velocity of the mixture discharging <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank,</b> and the large density differential {{between it and the}} remainder of the pulp in the tank, results in recirculating fluid patterns that keep the particles in the tank in suspension without requiring mechanical agitation.|$|E
25|$|Fresh air {{for both}} the crew and engine was drawn <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> via an 18m long rubber hose to which a float was {{attached}} to keep one end above the waterâ€™s surface. A radio antenna was also attached to the float to provide communication between the tank crew and the transport barge. The tank's engine was converted to be cooled with seawater, and the exhaust pipes were fitted with overpressure valves. Any water seeping into the tank's hull could be expelled by an internal bilge pump. Navigation underwater was accomplished using a directional gyrocompass or by following instructions radioed from the transport barge.|$|E

25|$|This system, {{invented by}} Albert Giblin and {{common in the}} UK, uses a storage tank {{similar to that used}} in the flapper-flush-valve system above. This flush valve system is {{sometimes}} referred to as a valveless system, since no traditional type of valve is required. Some would argue, however, that any system of regulating the flow of a fluid is still technically a valve. In the siphon-flush-valve system, the user pushes a lever or button, forcing the water up <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> siphon passageway which then empties the water in the tank into the bowl. The advantage of a siphon over the flush valve is that it has no sealing washers that can wear out and cause leaks, so it is favoured in places where {{there is a need to}} conserve water.|$|E
25|$|The Cell is {{operated}} by initially closing the air inlet {{at the top}} of the downcomer and feeding the flotation pulp in through the nozzle. The air in the downcomer is entrained in the pulp, creating a partial vacuum that draws pulp from the tank up into the downcomer. The pulp level quickly reaches the nozzle, which is at a level above that of the liquid level in the tank. This creates a hydrostatic head in the downcomer, meaning that the pressure inside the top of the downcomer is lower than the atmospheric pressure. When the inlet is opened, air is drawn into the top space of the downcomer by this lower pressure, where it too is entrained into the downcomer contents by the plunging jet. At the same time, a downward flow is established in the pulp in the downcomer that is sufficient to counter the buoyancy of the bubbles, and the aerated pulp discharges <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{drip line}} or trickle acclimating method {{is a safe}} and gentle way to {{introduce}} saltwater fish into a new home, and is a fairly simple one to perform. This procedure {{can be used to}} acclimate all types of marine as well as freshwater livestock. First, the fish is placed with all the bag water in a bucket or container of sufficient size for the fish to be reasonably covered with the water, and the bucket is then set {{on the floor next to}} the aquarium. Using some plastic air line tubing and an air gang valve, a siphon drip line is set up from the aquarium to the bucket. Tank water is allowed to drip slowly into the bucket, using the gang valve to adjust the drip rate, until the water dripped into the bucket equals about two to three times the original volume of the bag water. After testing the pH, salinity, and temperature of the water in the bucket to see if these parameters match that of the tank water, the fish is gently removed and placed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank.</b>|$|E

500|$|An {{enclosed}} [...] {{tank was}} used for sinking interiors, in which the entire set could be tilted into the water. In order to sink the Grand Staircase, [...] of water were dumped into the set as it was lowered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank.</b> Unexpectedly, the waterfall ripped the staircase from its steel-reinforced foundations, although no one was hurt. The [...] exterior of the RMS Titanic had its first half lowered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank,</b> but as the heaviest part of the ship it acted as a shock absorber against the water; to get the set into the water, Cameron had much of the set emptied and even smashed some of the promenade windows himself. After submerging the dining saloon, three days were spent shooting Lovett's ROV traversing the wreck in the present. The post-sinking scenes in the freezing Atlantic were shot in a [...] tank, where the frozen corpses were created by applying on actors a powder that crystallized when exposed to water, and wax was coated on hair and clothes.|$|E
500|$|An {{overflow}} such as {{this results}} in the rapid formation of a rich fuel and air vapour. CCTV footage showed such a vapour flowing out the bund wall from around 05:38.

500|$|Spain's Leopard2E {{is based}} on the Leopard 2A6, and {{incorporates}} the add-on wedge armor of the Leopard 2A5 on the turret. This armor maximizes the armor depth that a kinetic energy penetrator must travel through to enter the internal volume of the turret. Like the Swedish Leopard 2S (Strv 122), the Leopard2E has increased armor thickness on the hull's glacis plate, the turret frontal arc and the turret roof, bringing the vehicle's weight close to 63tonnes (69.4tons). The vehicle's protection is [...] augmented by the added armor that is built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> during the manufacturing process, as opposed to being added on after assembly as is the case for German Leopard2A5s and 2A6s. As a consequence, the Leopard2E is one of the best-protected Leopard2s in service.|$|E
