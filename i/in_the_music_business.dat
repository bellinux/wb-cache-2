25|$|After the Aloha special, Parker made a {{deal that}} would later be used in court {{to prove that he}} had not acted in the best {{interests}} of Presley. He offered RCA the opportunity to buy Presley's entire back catalog for a mere $5.4 million. At the time, Presley's back catalog was not considered that important and RCA initially calculated it at being worth much less, but in later years it would become one of the most valuable catalogs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>business.</b> The sale of the catalog to RCA meant that after his death Presley's estate would not receive any royalties for his songs prior to 1973. To be fair to Parker, however, Presley had asked him to raise funds to pay for his upcoming divorce settlement. Presley, who was never one to know the full ins and outs of the music business, would have probably had no idea how important his back catalogue was, and therefore would have trusted Parker's judgment on the matter. Parker, too, could have never known how valuable the catalog would become.|$|E

A deal with a commercial developer fell through, and by 1960, with the New York Philharmonic on the move to Lincoln Center, the building was slated for demolition to make way for a commercial skyscraper. Under pressure from a group led by violinist Isaac Stern and many of the artist residents, special legislation was passed that allowed the City of New York to buy the site from Simon for $5 million (which he would use to establish Reston, VA), and in May 1960 the nonprofit Carnegie Hall Corporation was created to run the venue.
