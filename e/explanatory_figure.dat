In principle, these imperfections can be detected and measured with gravitational lensing through discontinuities in image magnification and image structure. Lens solutions are discussed for the most common universal classes of discontinuities. Edges caused by cold particles such as condensed axions and thermal WIMPs are very sharp, respectively about $ 10 ^{- 12 }$ and $ 10 ^{- 7 }$ of the halo scale. Their structure can be resolved by stellar and quasi-stellar sources which show sudden changes in brightness or even sudden disappearances (sometimes within hours) as edges are crossed. Images of extended objects such as edge-on galaxies or jets can show sudden bends at an edge, or stretched, parity-inverted reflection symmetry about a sharp line.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the Sommerfeld enhancement to dark matter annihilation {{in the presence of a}}n excited state, where the interaction inducing the enhancement is purely off-diagonal, such as in models of exciting or inelastic dark matter. We derive a simple and accurate semi-analytic approximation for the s-wave enhancement, which is valid provided the mass splitting between the ground and excited states is not too large, and discuss the cutoff of the enhancement for large mass splittings. We reproduce previously derived results in the appropriate limits, and demonstrate excellent agreement with numerical calculations of the enhancement. We show that the presence of an excited state leads to generically larger values of the Sommerfeld enhancement, larger resonances, and shifting of the resonances to lower mediator masses. Furthermore, in the presence of a mass splitting the enhancement is no longer a monotonic function of velocity: the enhancement where the kinetic energy is close to that required to excite the higher state can be up to twice as large as the enhancement at zero velocity.

40|$|In this paper, we have studied, {{within a}} {{discrete}} WLC model, the spatial constraints in magnetic tweezers used in single molecule experiments. Two elements are involved: first, the fixed plastic slab on which is stuck the initial strand, second, the magnetic bead which pulls (or twists) the attached molecule free end. We {{have shown that}} the bead surface can be replaced by its tangent plane at the anchoring point, when it is close to the bead south pole relative to the force. We are led to a model with two parallel repulsive plates: the fixed anchoring plate and a fluctuating plate, simulating the bead, in thermal equilibrium with the system. The bead effect is a slight upper shift of the elongation, about four times smaller than the similar effect induced by the fixed plate. This rather unexpected result, has been qualitatively confirmed within the soluble Gaussian model. A study of the molecule elongation versus the countour length exhibits a significant non-extensive behaviour. The curve for short molecules (with less than 2 kbp) is well fitted by a straight line, with a slope given by the WLC model, but it does not go through the origin. The non-extensive offset gives a 15 % upward shift to the elongation of a 2 kbp molecule stretched by a 0. 3 pN force. Comment: 28 pages, 6 figures An <b>explanatory</b> <b>figure</b> has been added.

40|$|In {{the process}} of {{developing}} a new wedge anchorage to anchor prestressed CFRP rods, five different anchorage designs were manufactured. These designs have led to a constantly increased ultimate failure load of the prestressing system and an eventual load level above 95 % of the ultimate failure load of the rod was achieved. If 100 % efficiency is achieved the anchorage does not reduce the capacity of the system, but failure is then governed by the capacity of the rod itself, which is considered favourable and required by several guidelines. In the process seven different failure modes were identified: soft slip, power slip, cutting of fibres, crushing of rod, bending of fibres, frontal overload and intermediate rupture. In this paper the failure modes are discussed further. The failures are documented with <b>explanatory</b> <b>figures</b> and their backgrounds are found in the theory. Suggestions are given on how these failures can be avoided in theory and practice. From the experiences gained in the project, it is concluded that it is a challenging task to create a fully mechanical anchorage for CFRP tendons and that the failure margins are small between a successful and an unsuccesful anchorage system.

40|$|Typical circuit {{implementations}} of Shor's algorithm involve controlled rotation {{gates of}} magnitude π/ 2 ^ 2 L where L is the binary {{length of the}} integer N to be factored. Such gates cannot be implemented exactly using existing fault-tolerant techniques. Approximating a given controlled π/ 2 ^d rotation gate to within δ=O(1 / 2 ^d) currently requires both a number of qubits and number of fault-tolerant gates that grows polynomially with d. In this paper we show that this additional growth {{in space and time}} complexity would severely limit the applicability of Shor's algorithm to large integers. Consequently, we study in detail the effect of using only controlled rotation gates with d {{less than or equal to}} some d_ max. It is found that integers up to length L_ max = O(4 ^d_ max) can be factored without significant performance penalty implying that the cumbersome techniques of fault-tolerant computation only need to be used to create controlled rotation gates of magnitude π/ 64 if integers thousands of bits long are desired factored. Explicit fault-tolerant constructions of such gates are also discussed. Comment: Substantially revised version, twice as long as original.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the hypothesis that}} galactic dark matter is composed of ultra-light scalar particles and use internal properties of dwarf spheroidal galaxies to establish a preferred range for the mass m of these bosonic particles. We re-investigate {{the problem of the}} longevity of the cold clump in Ursa Minor and the problem of the rapid orbital decay of the globular clusters in Fornax and dwarf ellipticals. Treating the scalar field halo as a rigid background gravitational potential and using N-body simulations, we have explored how the dissolution timescale of the cold clump in Ursa Minor depends on m. It is demonstrated that for masses in the range 0. 3 x 10 ^- 22 eV < m < 1 x 10 ^- 22 eV, scalar field dark halos without self-interaction would have cores large enough to explain the longevity of the cold clump in Ursa Minor and the wide distribution of globular clusters in Fornax, but small enough to make the mass of the dark halos compatible with dynamical limits. It is encouraging to see that this interval of m is consistent with that needed to suppress the overproduction of substructure in galactic halos and is compatible with the acoustic peaks of cosmic microwave radiation. On the other hand, for self-interacting scalar fields with coupling constant l, values of m^ 4 /l <= 0. 55 x 10 ^ 3 eV^ 4 are required to account for the properties of the dark halos of these dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

40|$|The Shear TEsting Programme, STEP, is a {{collaborative}} project {{to improve the}} accuracy and reliability of all weak lensing measurements {{in preparation for the}} next generation of wide-field surveys. In this first STEP paper we present the results of a blind analysis of simulated ground-based observations of relatively simple galaxy morphologies. The most successful methods are shown to achieve percent level accuracy. From the cosmic shear pipelines that have been used to constrain cosmology, we find weak lensing shear measured to an accuracy that is within the statistical errors of current weak lensing analyses, with shear measurements accurate to better than 7 %. The dominant source of measurement error is shown to arise from calibration uncertainties where the measured shear is over or under-estimated by a constant multiplicative factor. This is of concern as calibration errors cannot be detected through standard diagnostic tests. The measured calibration errors appear to result from stellar contamination, false object detection, the shear measurement method itself, selection bias and/or the use of biased weights. Additive systematics (false detections of shear) resulting from residual point-spread function anisotropy are, in most cases, reduced to below an equivalent shear of 0. 001, an order of magnitude below cosmic shear distortions on the scales probed by current surveys. Our results provide a snapshot view of the accuracy of current ground-based weak lensing methods and a benchmark upon which we can improve.

40|$|We {{address the}} task of {{switching}} off the Hamiltonian of a system by removing all internal and system-environment couplings. We propose dynamical decoupling schemes, that use only bounded-strength controls, for quantum many-body systems with local system Hamiltonians and local environmental couplings. To do so, we introduce the combinatorial concept of balanced-cycle orthogonal arrays (BOAs) and show how to construct them from classical error-correcting codes. The derived decoupling schemes may be useful as a primitive for more complex schemes, e. g., for Hamiltonian simulation. For the case of n qubits and a 2 -local Hamiltonian, {{the length of the}} resulting decoupling scheme scales as O(n n), improving over the previously best-known schemes that scaled quadratically with n. More generally, using balanced-cycle orthogonal arrays constructed from families of BCH codes, we show that bounded-strength decoupling for any ℓ-local Hamiltonian, where ℓ≥ 2, can be achieved using decoupling schemes of length at most O(n^ℓ- 1 n).

40|$|The set of coupled {{equations}} for the self-consistent propagator and {{the field}} expectation value is solved numerically with high accuracy in Euclidean space at zero temperature and in the broken symmetry phase of the phi^ 4 model. Explicitly finite equations are derived with the adaptation of the renormalization method of van Hees and Knoll [H. van Hees, J. Knoll, Phys. Rev. D 65, 025010 (2001) ] {{to the case of}} non-vanishing field expectation value. The set of renormalization conditions used in this method leads to the same set of counterterms obtained recently in A. Patkos, Zs. Szep, Nucl. Phys. A 811, 329 - 352 (2008). This makes possible the direct comparison of the accurate solution of explicitly finite equations with the solution of renormalized equations containing counterterms. The numerically efficient way of solving iteratively these latter equations is obtained by deriving at each order of the iteration new counterterms which evolve during the iteration process towards the counterterms determined based on the asymptotic behavior of the converged propagator. As shown at different values of the coupling, the use of these evolving counterterms accelerates the convergence of the solution of the equations.

This model serves {{as the basis for the}} simulations presented in the handbook. The 'core' of the model is the raytrace package OSAC, which we have substantially modified and now refer to as SAOsac. One major structural modification to the software has been to utilize the UNIX binary pipe data transport mechanism for passing rays between program modules. This change has made it possible to simulate rays which are distributed randomly over the entrance aperture of the telescope. It has also resulted in a highly efficient system for tracing large numbers of rays. In one application to date (the analysis of VETA-I ring focus data) we have employed 2 x 10 (exp 7) rays, a substantial improvement over the limit of 1 x 10 (exp 4) rays in the original OSAC module. A second major modification is the manner in which SAOsac incorporates low spatial frequency surface errors into the geometric raytrace. The original OSAC included the ability to use Legendre-Fourier polynomials to describe deviations from the basic optical prescription. To this we have added bicubic splines to address a deficiency in the handling of the sharper deformations in the areas of mirror support pads.

40|$|We {{consider}} spherically symmetric inhomogeneous pressure Stephani universes, {{the center}} of symmetry being our location. The main feature of these models is that comoving observers do not follow geodesics. In particular, comoving perfect fluids have necessarily a radially dependent pressure. We consider a subclass of these models characterized by some inhomogeneity parameter β. We show that also the velocity of sound, like the (effective) equation of state parameter, of comoving perfect fluids acquire away from the origin a time and radial dependent change proportional to β. In order to produce a realistic universe accelerating at late times without dark energy component one must take β < 0. The redshift gets a modified dependence on the scale factor a(t) with a relative modification of - 9 % peaking at z∼ 4 and vanishing at the big-bang and today on our past lightcone. The equation of state parameter and {{the speed of sound}} of dustlike matter (corresponding to a vanishing pressure at {{the center of}} symmetry r= 0) behave in a similar way and away from the center of symmetry they become negative [...] a property usually encountered for the dark energy component only. In order to mimic the observed late-time accelerated expansion, the matter component must significantly depart from standard dust, presumably ruling this subclass of Stephani models out as a realistic cosmology. The only way to accept these models is to keep all standard matter components of the universe including dark energy and take an inhomogeneity parameter β small enough.

Operation emissions are both dominating the CO 2 life cycle of the fossil fuel-propelled Smart (column 1, Figure 2) as well as an electric Smart (column 2, Figure 2) if charged with German mean grid electricity. This is in accordance with the findings of Helms et al. [40] as well as Notter et al. [61]. Other studies report higher BEV CO 2 life cycle impacts during operation when charged with grid mix, e.g. Helms et al. [40] with approximately 20 t (mid-size car) and Held and Baumann [42] also with approximately 20 t (mini-class), however recalculated for 150, 000 to 171, 600 km of operation. Other differences will partly be due to a higher battery and car weight (Table 5). However, we calculated the direct CO 2 emissions due to fuel combustion (including fuel chain emissions) as well as indirect CO 2 emissions due to consumption of the German grid electricity (for details, see <b>explanatory</b> notes in <b>Figure</b> 2). Calculation of CO 2 -equivalents based on ecoinvent 2.2 database adds up to 9.4 t instead of 8.2 t for the operation phase of the electric Smart (column 2 in Figure 2).|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study will be {{primarily}} to secure specific kinds of information for use in the schools of Nebraska in regard to the selection of students for vocational commercial courses. Broadly speaking the aim of the study is suggested by such questions as the following: Are there definite procedures for selecting students for the vocational commercial courses in use in the high schools? Is there no tangible attempt in this direction but rather incidental practices that are “taken for granted” by the commercial teacher? Are there some vocational commercial course levels where special selection procedures should be attempted but other course levels where they should not? Should special selection procedures apply {{in the case of the}} newer and highly vocational course, “Office Practice” that is being substituted in the curriculum of some of our Nebraska high schools for the former second year shorthand and second year typing courses? What constitutes a good guidance program for vocational commercial course work on the high school level in our rural Nebraska students? This procedure involved the actual preparation of the questionnaire (appendix, figure # 2), the mimeographing of the questionnaire and an <b>explanatory</b> letter (appendix, <b>figure</b> # 1), and the addressing and mailing of the questionnaire to 207 commercial teachers in the state of Nebraska who were considered representative of the commercial teachers in the state. Our second line of approach which was somewhat limited in scope because of the small number of students who made up the subject groups, involved the comparison of success of students in specific commercial courses (as shown by teacher’s grades) with other variables that were either available or made available for the use of this study. Only the students that were registered for commercial class work at Hay Springs, Nebraska in the school year 47 - 48 were included in this part of the study. Advisor: Warren R. Balle...|$|R
