40|$|A method {{based on}} fuzzy {{concepts}} is employed {{in this paper}} to obtain reasonable estimates of diffuse pollution from agricultural run off using limited available information. Annual average use of herbicide per unit area, extent of herbicide applied area and herbicide application season are considered as fuzzy input sets and observed herbicide concentration at the basin outlet as the <b>fuzzy</b> <b>output</b> <b>set.</b> Fuzzy rules are generated from the available data sets from which combined rule bases are formed. These rules are then used for mapping the input space to output space using a defuzzification procedure. This method learns from historical information. The method is demonstrated with two common herbicides, Atrazine and Metalochlore for the White River basin (US). The model is capable of generating monthly average values for the herbicide concentration with a reasonable accuracy...|$|E
30|$|The Mamdani {{engine type}} merges {{together}} fuzzy rules into a mapping from <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets</b> to <b>fuzzy</b> <b>output</b> <b>sets</b> and then apply defuzzification to the <b>output</b> <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> to obtain crisp outputs, while the Takagi-Sugeno directly relates fuzzy inputs and crisp outputs using singleton spikes output membership function. The defuzzification step {{is the final}} stage of the fuzzy inference process which is accomplished by the defuzzifier by converting the <b>output</b> <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> into a crisp number using different methods such as: centroid of area, bisector of area, mean of maxima, or maximum criteria.|$|R

This {{is accomplished by}} first quantifying each rule using fuzzy set theory, and by then using the mathematics of fuzzy sets to establish the output of each rule, {{with the help of}} an inference mechanism. If there are M rules then the fuzzy input sets to the Inference block will activate only a subset of those rules, where the subset contains at least one rule and usually way fewer than M rules. Inference is done one rule at a time. So, at the output of the Inference block, there will be one or more fired-rule <b>fuzzy</b> <b>output</b> <b>sets.</b>|$|R

As {{discussed in}} Section 3.3. 1, the same <b>output</b> <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> is utilized {{for all the}} controllers. The membership functions and fuzzy rules of the DRC are set such that by utilizing the same <b>output</b> <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> for all the controllers, dynamic prioritization is achieved between the delay-sensitive and best-effort traffic.|$|R
30|$|Channel {{diversity}} exploitation: {{the main}} goal of the scheduler is to maximize the system throughput subject to maintaining the deadline violations below the prescribed threshold (Equation 5). At lower normalized average packet latency, the priority difference between the delay-sensitive and best-effort flows is minimal. Hence, flows from different traffic classes are scheduled based on their QoS performance and channel quality. Utilization of same <b>output</b> <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> for the DRC, proactive, and reactive controllers: the prioritization of the delay-sensitive flows w.r.t the best-effort traffic {{can be achieved by}} using the same <b>output</b> <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> for the proactive, reactive, and DRC controllers. When the <b>output</b> <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> of these controllers are same, then the increase in latency of the delay-sensitive flows causes a reduction in the <b>output</b> <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> of the best-effort traffic as shown in Figure 7. When the network becomes heavily congested, then delay bound violations occur for the delay-sensitive flows. The delay bound violation further reduces the <b>output</b> <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> of the best-effort traffic as shown in Figure 7. Thus, decreasing the resource allocation probability of the best-effort traffic.|$|R

30|$|Utilization {{of delay}} {{tolerant}} {{nature of the}} best-effort traffic: according to the policy guidelines of the QoS architecture in the 3 GPP standard, the resource allocation probability of the best-effort traffic class should be minimum in situations where the network becomes congested with delay-sensitive traffic. When the traffic load reaches the network capacity, the increase in average packet’s latency of the delay-sensitive traffic decreases the maximum limit of the <b>output</b> <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> for the best-effort flows as shown in Figure 7. Since best-effort traffic is delay tolerant, the decreased maximum limit of the <b>output</b> <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set</b> ensures delay-sensitive traffic gets priority over best-effort traffic.|$|R

40|$|Computing with words, or CW, is {{a method}} of using words derived from a natural {{language}} [1] rather than numbers for computing and reasoning, CW simulates {{the way in which}} humans express and use their knowledge since its processing is close to that of a natural language, using a mathematical model to produce meanings for inexact words and phrases. Computing with words has been used in numerous applications such as decision analysis. In a CW Inference Engine, since the inputs are linguistic words, the outputs should be linguistic expressions so as to make more sense to humans [2]. In this thesis, I have adjusted and implemented the method introduced in [3] for generating linguistic expressions for <b>fuzzy</b> <b>output</b> <b>sets</b> produced by CW inference. The process for finding linguistic labels is called linguistic approximation (LA). Linguistic approximation plays an essential role in finding the best <b>output</b> <b>fuzzy</b> label. It provides a solution for the problem of finding the meaning of a given fuzzy set. In general, it is required to map a given fuzzy value (which is an <b>output</b> of some <b>fuzzy</b> computation) to a set of predefined terms, defined on the same universe of discourse [9]. The result of a linguistic approximation algorithm will be linguistic expressions, atomic terms and linguistic modifiers [3]. The algorithm works by dividing the membership function into segments and then finding the most appropriate linguistic expressions corresponding to the meaning of the fuzzy set...|$|R

30|$|In general applications, {{there are}} {{multiple}} fuzzy rules. Each fuzzy rule determines the membership degree of the output in a certain <b>output</b> <b>fuzzy</b> <b>set.</b> In the overlapping part of each fuzzy set, the membership degree is taken as the maximum value, so that the final output of the membership graph can be obtained.

Fuzzy aggregation is the process by which the fuzzy sets that represent the outputs of each rule are combined into a single fuzzy set.

Then, if necessary, de-normalisation is performed on the output so as to obtain the corresponding action on its physical domain.|$|R

The max operator chooses the maximum value of the rules’ outputs, whereas the average operator calculates their mean value.

40|$|Fuzzy {{logic is}} based on the central idea that in fuzzy sets each element in the set can assume a value from 0 to 1, not just 0 or 1, as in classic set theory. Thus, {{qualitative}} characteristics and numerically scaled measures can exhibit gradations in {{the extent to which they}} belong to the relevant sets for evaluation. This degree of membership of each element is a measure of the element’s "belonging" to the set, and thus of the precision with which it explains the phenomenon being evaluated.

40|$|Abstract Stability of a {{fuzzy control}} system {{is closely related}} to the {{analytical}} structure of the fuzzy controller, which is determined by its components such as input and <b>output</b> <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets</b> and fuzzy rules. We first characterize the mathematical input–output structure of fuzzy controllers and then utilize the structure charac-teristics to advance stability analysis. We study how the components of a general class of Mamdani fuzzy controllers dictate the controller’s input–output relation-ship. The controllers can use input fuzzy sets of any types, arbitrary fuzzy rules, arbitrary inference methods, either Zadeh or the product fuzzy logic AND oper-ator, singleton <b>output</b> <b>fuzzy</b> <b>sets,</b> and the centroid defuzzifier. We theoretically prove that regardless of the choices for the other components, if and only if Zadeh fuzzy AND operator and piecewise linear (e. g., trapezoidal or triangular) input fuzzy sets are used, the fuzzy controllers become a peculiar class of nonlinear controllers with the following interesting characteristics: (1) they are linear with respect to input variables; (2) their control gains dynamically change with the input variables; and (3) they become linear controllers with constant gains around the system equilibrium point. These properties make the fuzzy controllers suitable for analysis and design using conventional control theory. This necessary and sufficient condition becomes a sufficient condition if the product AND operator is employed instead. We name the fuzzy controllers of this peculiar class type-A fuzzy controllers. Taking advantage of this new structure knowledge, we have established a necessary and sufficient local stability condition for the type-A fuzzy control systems. It can be used not only for the stability determination, but also fo...|$|R
