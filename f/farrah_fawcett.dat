5|$|In February and March 2009, Morrison {{returned}} to the US for Astral Weeks Live concerts, interviews and TV appearances with concerts at Madison Square Garden and at the Beacon Theatre in New York City. He was interviewed by Don Imus on his Imus in the Morning radio show and put in guest appearances on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and Live with Regis and Kelly.

Morrison filmed the concerts at the Orpheum Theatre so they could be viewed by <b>Farrah</b> <b>Fawcett,</b> confined to bed with cancer and thus unable to attend the concerts.|$|E
25|$|Although {{it was not}} {{connected}} to the show, a 1976 poster of <b>Farrah</b> <b>Fawcett</b> sporting a red bathing suit became the biggest selling poster in history with 20 million copies sold. This poster also helped the burgeoning popularity of the series.|$|E

5|$|Adams' first {{paid work}} was a Farrah Foxette pinup that he copied from <b>Farrah</b> <b>Fawcett's</b> iconic 1976 {{swimsuit}} poster, which he {{submitted to the}} letters page of the DC Comics series Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew! That series' editor, Roy Thomas, paid Adams $10 to publish the piece as a fan pinup.|$|R
5000|$|Owen told Billboard {{magazine}} that {{the inspiration for}} the song was <b>Farrah</b> <b>Fawcett's</b> famous poster from the '70's. [...] "If you listen to the words, it's a double play on the words. We didn't want to give it away. You remember when we were kids, every guy had that poster.

25|$|In {{addition}} to the Malibu home, Teodorin also paid $6.5 million in 2001 for {{a house in the}} Bel Air section of Los Angeles, but never moved in. The house was on Antelo Road, {{across the street from the}} residence of the actress <b>Farrah</b> <b>Fawcett.</b>|$|E

5000|$|... ===1970s-1990s=== A famous {{example of}} this {{phenomenon}} was <b>Farrah</b> <b>Fawcett's</b> hairstyle, {{as seen in the}} American television show Charlie's Angels in the 1970s. Another around that time was the short [...] "Purdey" [...] cut adopted by British actress Joanna Lumley for her role of that name in the television series The New Avengers, and the short Dorothy Hamill Wedge hairstyle.|$|R
50|$|Anderson's {{most famous}} acting role came as the sultry {{receptionist}} Jennifer Marlowe on the sitcom WKRP in Cincinnati (1978 - 1982). She {{was offered the}} role when producers saw the poster of her in a red swimsuit—a pose similar to <b>Farrah</b> <b>Fawcett's</b> famous 1976 pin-up. The sitcom's creator, Hugh Wilson, later admitted Anderson got the role because her body resembled Jayne Mansfield and because she possessed the innocent sexuality of Marilyn Monroe.|$|R
5000|$|On a {{more serious}} note, Nevius and his company {{produced}} Farrah's Story (a.k.a. [...] "A Wing and A Prayer"). The documentary chronicled <b>Farrah</b> <b>Fawcett's</b> battle with cancer both in the USA and in Germany {{as well as her}} efforts to protect her privacy from the tabloids and paparazzi. The film gave NBC its best rating on a Friday night since the Summer Olympics and garnered Emmy nominations for both Fawcett and Nevius as executive producers in the category of Best Nonfiction Programming.

25|$|The British writer Tony Barrell has {{explored}} urban legends in a long-running column in The Sunday Times.

25|$|As of September, 2011, {{all five}} seasons {{of the show}} can be {{purchased}} in the USA on iTunes.

As of 2009 the series is still available for syndication to local television stations in the United States. It is currently airing on the U.S. digital broadcast television network Cozi TV and FamilyNet.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, the Robinson Hill {{case was}} the subject of Murder in Texas, a {{television}} film featuring <b>Farrah</b> <b>Fawcett</b> as Robinson Hill. It concurs with Kurth's theory that Hill may have faked his death, suggesting that he arranged for someone else to be killed in his place. The journalist Jerry Buck noted in an article preceding the film's debut on NBC that the face of the shooting victim had been battered and that there were anomalies in the autopsy report, notably that Hill had a different eye color from that recorded for the dead person. Buck also wrote that Hill was in financial difficulties with the Internal Revenue Service in 1972 and facing a murder case against him. Sightings of Hill had also been reported in Mexico and New York City.|$|E
50|$|In 1984, Tisch {{produced}} a made-for-TV movie entitled The Burning Bed, which caused controversy but also received eleven Emmy nominations for <b>Farrah</b> <b>Fawcett's</b> {{depiction of a}} battered wife. Tisch launched his own production company in 1986, called the Steve Tisch Company, which has since specialized in small screen films. However, he also produced several critically acclaimed films including Forrest Gump, American History X, and Snatch. Tisch received a Best Motion Picture Academy Award and a Golden Globe for Forrest Gump, which was nominated for 13 Academy Awards and won six, and {{remains one of the}} 20 highest domestic box office grossing films in history. He is also the only person ever with a Golden Globe, an Academy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award nomination, and a Super Bowl Ring.|$|R
50|$|The next year, {{she landed}} a small role in Skipped Parts in 2000 {{starring}} Drew Barrymore and Mischa Barton, then appeared in four more TV movies and features that year, including playing <b>Farrah</b> <b>Fawcett's</b> {{daughter in the}} TNT network movie Baby and a lead role in the Canadian film The Dinosaur Hunter, which was originally intended to be shown at a dinosaur museum and on a provincial education channel, but which {{made its way to}} the Burbank International Film Festival, winning Pill an award for Best Child Actress. She landed the role of young Lorna in the ABC-TV biopic Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows in 2001, based on the memoir by Garland's daughter, Lorna Luft. That year, Pill also played Sissy Spacek's daughter in the TV flick Midwives.|$|R
50|$|Sternhagen {{made her}} film debut in 1967's New York City high school drama Up the Down Staircase, which starred Sandy Dennis. She has worked {{periodically}} in Hollywood since then.

25|$|Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts came up {{with the}} idea for a series about three {{beautiful}} female private investigators as a breakthrough but also escapist television series. Producers Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg first considered actress Kate Jackson during the early pre-production stages of the series. She had proven popular with viewers in another police television drama, The Rookies. Jackson was initially cast as Kelly Garrett, but was more attracted to the role of Sabrina Duncan, and her request to switch roles was granted. <b>Farrah</b> <b>Fawcett</b> was next cast as Jill Munroe, but much like Jackson, did not audition for a role. She was offered a part by Spelling after he had viewed her performance in the science-fiction film Logan's Run (1976). Jaclyn Smith was among the hundreds of actresses who auditioned for the role of Kelly Garrett. Despite liking Smith, Spelling and Goldberg were wary about hiring her because their initial concept concerned a brunette, blonde, and red-headed woman. Smith was the only brunette that auditioned for the role and was cast only after producers liked the on-screen chemistry she shared with Jackson and Fawcett.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the episode, Bart can be heard whistling The Simpsons theme song and Marge tells him [...] "not to whistle that annoying tune". Bart imagines himself appearing on Match Game in 2034 alongside Billy Crystal, <b>Farrah</b> <b>Fawcett</b> Majors O'Neal, Loni Anderson, Spike Lee and Kitty Carlisle's head in a jar. Bart records an [...] "I Didn't Do It" [...] rap with the backing track from MC Hammer's [...] "U Can't Touch This".|$|E
500|$|Gair {{has earned}} many motion picture credits for {{work as a}} make-up artist. In 1996 & 1997, she was {{employed}} on three of Moore's films (Striptease, If These Walls Could Talk & G.I. Jane). In addition, she earned a 1997 credit on [...] for <b>Farrah</b> <b>Fawcett.</b> In 2002, she earned a make-up credit on People I Know for working with Kim Basinger. She also earned a 2003 credit for work on the short documentary The Work of Director Chris Cunningham.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to performing with The Second City improv group in Toronto and Los Angeles, Oldring {{has appeared on}} Canadian television. He was also a regular cast member of the redneck-themed sketch comedy series Blue Collar TV. Feature film roles include K-19: The Widowmaker, Focus and Lost and Delirious. He has a starring role in Intern Academy. He also played <b>Farrah</b> <b>Fawcett's</b> gay assistant in the television movie Hollywood Wives. Oldring also appeared in the series Doc and The WB's D.C., {{as well as in}} the television movie The Ricky Nelson Story. Oldring voiced Cody, Ezekiel and Tyler in Total Drama. Oldring also starred in the 2007 film Young People Fucking. In 2011, he was cast as [...] "Lonnie" [...] in the Disney XD show Kickin' It. He had a supporting role in the premiere episode of the 4th season of Psych, [...] "Extradition: British Columbia." ...|$|R
5000|$|Scarwid's next {{roles were}} as a {{nurturing}} guidance counselor in the made-for-TV film Desperate Lives (1982); an abducted {{woman in the}} 1983 science-fiction film Strange Invaders; a heroin-abusing student teacher in Rumble Fish (1983); a lesbian funeral parlor-beautician in Silkwood, the 1983 autobiographical film depicting the turn of events which {{led up to the}} disappearance of Karen Silkwood; a rape victim in the revenge film The Ladies Club; a suicidal nun in Psycho III (1986), the second sequel to Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho and the third film in the [...] Psycho series; and <b>Farrah</b> <b>Fawcett's</b> character's roommate in the 1986 film adaptation of William Mastrosimone's 1982 play Extremities. Finishing off the decade, Scarwid assumed roles as a casino dealer in the Burt Reynolds film Heat; Mark Harmon's character's wife in the made-for-TV film After the Promise (1987); and a lacquered reporter in Brenda Starr, the adventure film based on Dale Messick's comic strip of the same name.|$|R
5000|$|Prominent {{concepts}} {{in the film}} are [...] "the dangers of hedonism, youth worship, and, particularly, the dangers of government-sponsored euthanasia". The hedonism is primarily conveyed {{in the form of}} sensuality and [...] "images of sexual abandon". Aside from sexual freedom, the pursuit of pleasure is also reflected in how this was envisioned in the 1970s, including miniskirts, little career, relaxed gyms, and <b>Farrah</b> <b>Fawcett's</b> [...] "shag" [...] haircut. Author Barna William Donovan argues this serves to criticize many social developments underway in the 1970s, targeting the [...] "Me generation". Writer Robert Tinnell hypothesizes the design of the city, reminiscent of a shopping mall, is also suggestive of [...] "anticonsumerist sentiment". The film may ultimately serve as a warning against overthrowing older generations, aimed at young viewers following the counterculture movements in the 1960s. Another interpretation is that individualism, the [...] "freedom to live and be," [...] is curbed by [...] "social mechanisms" [...] telling citizens to have a good life for only a limited time. Logan, originally part of an [...] "artificial society" [...] centred on [...] "pleasure and spectacle," [...] becomes [...] "re-individualised" [...] and defies a [...] "conformist system". Despite the reflections of the 1970s, Donovan argues the film may also have relevance to the Internet age, with elements evocative of online dating.|$|R
500|$|In 1990, Baker {{played the}} role of Eleanor Crisp—described by Roger Ebert as [...] "an {{effective}} bitch on wheels"— in Ivan Reitman's comedy Kindergarten Cop, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, which she filmed in Astoria, Oregon, in the summer of 1990. The film was a huge financial success, grossing over $200 million worldwide. Her film and television work continued throughout the '90s, and she acted in many made-for-television movies, including the true-crime story [...] (1993), Witness Run (1996), and Dalva (1996) with <b>Farrah</b> <b>Fawcett.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written and {{directed}} by series co-creator Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States (specifically for adults, with coarse language). [...] "Dead Celebrities" [...] included references to several actors, singers and famous people who died before or during the summer of 2009, when South Park was on a mid-season hiatus. Among the celebrities featured in the episode were Billy Mays, Ed McMahon, <b>Farrah</b> <b>Fawcett,</b> Patrick Swayze, Walter Cronkite, Dom DeLuise, Ted Kennedy, Natasha Richardson, Bea Arthur, David Carradine, DJ AM, Michael Jackson, Ricardo Montalbán, and Steve McNair. [...] "Dead Celebrities" [...] also parodied the films The Sixth Sense and Poltergeist.|$|E
500|$|True crime author Ann Rule, on an ABC News {{special about}} child murderer Diane Downs, noted that Downs {{had been playing}} the song in her car before she shot her three children. Downs, who {{maintains}} that her children were shot by a [...] "bushy-haired stranger" [...] on the road, sang the song's chorus in court while recalling her version of events. This scenario, with the soundtrack was reenacted in the 1989 made-for-TV movie Small Sacrifices {{based on the book}} of the same name written by Ann Rule. Diane Downs was played by <b>Farrah</b> <b>Fawcett.</b> Rule, who witnessed the court proceedings, says that [...] "Hungry Like the Wolf" [...] gives her [...] "chills" [...] to this day.|$|E
500|$|According to Vanity Fair, the hairstyle's [...] "widespread {{popularity}} ... in the show’s {{very first}} year cemented the sitcom early on as heavily influential {{when it came}} to style." [...] The [...] "Rachel" [...] {{remains one of the most}} popular hairstyles in history, and became the most popular hairstyle in the United States since actress <b>Farrah</b> <b>Fawcett's.</b> Hair stylists credit its appeal and popularity to its medium length and volume, combined with its tendency to frame the face flatteringly. Hairdresser Mark Woolley described it as [...] "a cut that flatters almost everyone, designed to make women look beautiful". The [...] "Rachel" [...] is often ranked among the greatest and most iconic hairstyles of all-time, with Redbook placing it at number four and Time ranking it ninth. The Huffington Post determined that the hairstyle is one of [...] "The Most Famous TV Hairstyles Of All Time". US Weekly ranked the [...] "Rachel" [...] the 17th most iconic hairstyle. Glamour magazine ranked the [...] "Rachel" [...] fourth on the magazine's list of [...] "The 100 Best Hairstyles of All Time". The magazine also cited it among [...] "The very best hair to have graced the small screen", while ranking it the most memorable hairstyle in television history. The Sydney Morning Herald ranked it the second greatest television hairstyle, while Metro ranked the [...] "Rachel" [...] the character's second-best hairstyle. Ranked sixth on Entertainment Weeklys list of the [...] "25 Fashion Moments That Changed Entertainment", the haircut was declared the most [...] "desired" [...] hairstyle of the Clinton era.|$|R
5000|$|On June 5, 1997, Fawcett {{received}} negative commentary {{after giving}} a rambling interview and appearing distracted on Late Show with David Letterman. Months later, {{she told the}} host of The Howard Stern Show her behavior was just her way of joking around with the television host, partly {{in the guise of}} promoting her Playboy pictorial and video, explaining what appeared to be random looks across the theater was just her looking and reacting to fans in the audience. Though the Letterman appearance spawned speculation and several jokes at her expense, she returned to the show in 1999. Several years later in February 2009, Letterman ended an incoherent and largely unresponsive interview with Joaquin Phoenix by saying, [...] "We owe an apology to <b>Farrah</b> Fawcett." [...] <b>Fawcett's</b> elder sister, Diane Fawcett Walls, died of lung cancer just before her 63rd birthday, on October 16, 2001. The fifth episode of her 2005 Chasing Farrah series followed the actress home to Texas to visit with her father, James, and mother, Pauline. Pauline Fawcett died soon after her daughter, on March 4, 2005, at the age of 91.|$|R
500|$|Homer's {{encounter}} with the donut delivery man that delivers donuts to the power plant is {{a reference to a}} scene in the film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. Homer and his best friend Barney Gumble are watching Charlie's Angels when Marge tells the news of her pregnancy. A [...] of <b>Farrah</b> <b>Fawcett,</b> a cast member of Charlie's Angels, hangs on the wall in Barney's apartment. Dolly Parton's 9 to 5 is heard when Homer looks for a new job. The sign outside the wedding chapel resembles Vegas Vic from the Pioneer Club in Las Vegas. When Homer returns to the power plant to apply for a job the second time, Mr. Burns is seen playing the arcade game Ms. Pac-Man. The episode marks the first appearance of Burns's assistant Smithers's first name, Waylon, which comes from the puppeteer Wayland Flowers.|$|E
500|$|In {{some early}} first season episodes, Barney had yellow hair. Later in the {{production}} of that season, the producers had it changed to brown, because they thought that his hair looked like his skin; as well, during an artistic convention of the show, Groening stated that he wanted only the Simpsons to have yellow hair. Animation director Rich Moore modeled Barney's apartment on one he and several other animators who worked on the show shared, particularly the <b>Farrah</b> <b>Fawcett</b> poster and the cable spool table. The writers originally intended for the character to be the owner of Barney's Bowl-A-Rama. However, after making him [...] "pathetic", they could not regard him as a business owner any longer, and it was explained seasons later in [...] "And Maggie Makes Three" [...] that his Uncle Al owns the alley and named it after him.|$|E
500|$|Ike {{is terrified}} by {{frequent}} {{encounters with the}} ghosts of recently deceased celebrities. He is haunted by people such as <b>Farrah</b> <b>Fawcett,</b> David Carradine, Ed McMahon, DJ AM, and especially Billy Mays, who repeatedly tries selling Ike products from the afterlife. Kyle is terrified when he finds out about the ghost his brother is encountering and tells Stan, Cartman and Kenny about the encounters. Cartman, who does not initially care, decides to help when Kyle mentions {{that one of the}} ghosts haunting Ike is Billy Mays. Cartman then shows commercials that feature Mays on television, implying that he is an enthusiastic supporter of a product which Mays promoted, called [...] "ChipotlAway", which cleans bloodstains from people's underwear caused by eating food from Chipotle Mexican Grill. The boys call the team from the reality television series Ghost Hunters in to help, but they quickly, fearfully start ascribing supernatural meaning to random, ambient, environmental noises, before urinating and defecating on themselves, and finally running from the house. Eventually, Ike goes into a coma because of his multiple experiences with the ghosts.|$|E
500|$|In 1980 Donen {{made the}} science fiction film Saturn 3, {{starring}} Kirk Douglas, <b>Farrah</b> <b>Fawcett</b> and Harvey Keitel. Donen first {{read the script}} when its writer (and Movie Movies set designer) John Barry showed it to him, prompting Donen to pass it along to Lew Grade. Donen was initially hired to produce, but Grade asked him to complete the film when first-time director Barry was unable to direct. According to Donen [...] "only {{a tiny bit of}} what Barry shot ended up in the finished film." [...] It was a critical and financial disaster and initially Donen {{did not want to be}} credited as director. In the early 1980s Donen was attached to direct an adaptation of Stephen King's The Dead Zone and worked with writer Jeffrey Boam on the script. Donen eventually dropped out of the project and David Cronenberg directed the film a few years later. Boam stated that Donen was initially attracted to making the film because he wanted to [...] "connect with contemporary youthful audiences" [...] and that the script that they worked on together was [...] "very close to the script that David wound up making." ...|$|E
500|$|Billy Mays, a {{television}} advertisement salesman, {{is the first}} dead celebrity featured in the episode, and plays {{a large role in}} the early part of the script. Mays' son, Billy Mays III, a self-proclaimed South Park fan, said he loved [...] "Dead Celebrities", and found its portrayal of his father tasteful and respectful. He said, [...] "South Park gets a little edgy sometimes, but at their core, they're just social satire, you know? I think it was natural for them to do a dead celebrities episode with this whole summer and how it's been, and I think the way they did it was pretty tasteful for the most part." [...] The spirit of David Carradine is shown wearing lingerie and with a noose around his neck, a reference to his June 3, 2009, death by autoerotic asphyxiation. Among the others featured in the episode were actress <b>Farrah</b> <b>Fawcett,</b> journalist Walter Cronkite, disc jockey Adam Goldstein (DJ AM), politician Ted Kennedy, actress Beatrice Arthur, television personality Ed McMahon, actor Patrick Swayze, actress Natasha Richardson, hot dog magnate Oscar G. Mayer, Jr. and actor/chef Dom DeLuise.|$|E
500|$|The episode title, {{which is}} often wrongfully {{referred}} to as [...] "The Latest Gun In the West", is a pun based on [...] the term [...] "the fastest gun in the west". A scene in the episode shows McCoy auditioning for {{a spot in the}} Krusty the Clown show. To showcase his skills, McCoy shoots a Krusty cardboard cutout in the crotch. The scene is a reference to an incident on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, in which Ed Ames hit a mannequin in the crotch while demonstrating a tomahawk throw. Carson's quips during the incident are referenced in Krusty's line [...] "Ooh, right in the panhandle." [...] Carson can also be seen in one of the clips before Krusty's show in the episode, along with poet Robert Frost. The inside of McCoy's house is loosely based on the inside of Will Rogers' house in Will Rogers State Historic Park. [...] "McTrigger", the last TV series McCoy starred in, is a parody of the American television police drama McCloud, in which Weaver played the lead; McCoy claims the series was eventually retooled into Room 222. In one scene, Homer shows Bart a poster of himself dressed as <b>Farrah</b> <b>Fawcett.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{worked to}} incorporate 1980s fashion {{into the show}} {{in a way that}} [...] "felt fun, definitely, but also grounded in a reality where [...] could tell dramatic stories." [...] The styles featured were therefore constructed so that viewers would not be distracted from an emotional scene by characters wearing 1980s makeup, hairstyles, or shoulder pads. In addition, show makers wanted to make the series feel [...] "like something that you'd {{want to be a part}} of, rather than make fun of", and that young women would be inspired by the clothing styles featured in the spin-off as well as on Gossip Girl. During flashbacks in [...] "Valley Girls", Lily dresses in two styles of clothing. She appears in a preppy, upper-crust riding outfit while associating with her rich parents, but changes into a dress more typical of the [...] "underground punk-rock scene" [...] after running away to the San Fernando Valley. Snow describes her hairstyle as [...] "a little teased, feathered like <b>Farrah</b> <b>Fawcett</b> with curly bangs like Brooke Shields." [...] In present-day scenes, Blair and Serena both attend Prom in designer dresses; Blair dons a black and gold gown from the Marchesa Spring 2008 collection, while Serena wears a pink halter dress from the Christian Dior Spring 2009 collection. Belinda Goldsmith of Reuters cited the episode's Prom scene as an example of the media's glamorization of U.S. formal dances, which she says has caused the cost of formal dances around the world to rise.|$|E
