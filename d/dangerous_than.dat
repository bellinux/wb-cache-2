This was reduced to one microgram in July 1945 after animal studies found that the way plutonium distributed itself in bones was more <b>dangerous</b> <b>than</b> radium. Most of the subjects, Eileen Welsome says, were poor, powerless, and sick.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} was a {{replication}} of the research of Reason et al. (1990). Its aim was to confirm the distinction between driving errors and violations in a Western Australian driving population. Sixty-one male drivers and 74 female drivers completed a questionnaire containing items on driver demographics, driving penalties incurred, driving convictions and accident history and driver behavioural aberrations drawn from the Driver Behaviour Questionnaire (DBQ). In agreement with Reason et al. factor analysis revealed three factors; {{in the present study}} these were general errors, dangerous errors, and dangerous violations. Young drivers committed more dangerous errors and <b>dangerous</b> violations <b>than</b> older drivers. Females reported more <b>dangerous</b> errors <b>than</b> males. Males reported more <b>dangerous</b> violations <b>than</b> females. Drivers who reported a high level of road exposure and those who reported having been convicted for speeding reported more dangerous violations. Differences in the results of the two studies can largely by accounted for by differences in the representation of age and gender in the two populations studied...|$|R
5|$|As Ukrainian {{psychiatrist}} Ada Korotenko notes, {{the use of}} punitive psychiatry allowed {{of avoiding}} the judicial procedure during which the accused might declare the impossibility to speak publicly and the violation of their civil rights. Making a psychiatric diagnosis is insecure and can {{be based on a}} preconception. Moreover, while diagnosing mental illness, subjective fuzzy diagnostic criteria are involved as arguments. The lack of clear diagnostic criteria and clearly defined standards of diagnostics contributes to applying punitive psychiatry to vigorous and gifted citizens who disagree with authorities. At the same time, most psychiatrists incline to believe that such a misdiagnosis is less <b>dangerous</b> <b>than</b> not diagnosing mental illness.|$|E
5|$|Passive smoking—the {{inhalation}} {{of smoke}} from another's smoking—is {{a cause of}} lung cancer in nonsmokers. A passive smoker {{can be defined as}} someone living or working with a smoker. Studies from the US, Europe and the UK have consistently shown a significantly increased risk among those exposed to passive smoke. Those who live with someone who smokes have a 20–30% increase in risk while those who work in an environment with secondhand smoke have a 16–19% increase in risk. Investigations of sidestream smoke suggest it is more <b>dangerous</b> <b>than</b> direct smoke. Passive smoking causes about 3,400 deaths from lung cancer each year in the USA.|$|E
5|$|Spilled hot {{cooking oil}} {{can also cause}} severe third degree burns, In the {{worst-case}} scenario, severe burns can be fatal. The higher temperatures and tendency of oil {{to stick to the}} skin make spilled hot cooking oil far more <b>dangerous</b> <b>than</b> spilled hot water. Children can accidentally place their hands on top of the stove, playing with the materials while being cooked, or accidentally pull the pot down, which can cause significant injury. The utmost care should be used when deep frying when children are present, to protect their safety at all times.|$|E

5|$|Statistics on {{injuries}} {{related to}} commercial diving are normally collected by national regulators. In the UK the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) {{is responsible for}} the overview of about 5,000 commercial divers; in Norway the corresponding authority is the Petroleum Safety Authority Norway (PSA), which has maintained the DSYS database since 1985, gathering statistics on over 50,000 diver-hours of commercial activity per year. The risks of dying during recreational, scientific or commercial diving are small, and for scuba diving, deaths are usually associated with poor gas management, poor buoyancy control, equipment misuse, entrapment, rough water conditions and pre-existing health problems. Some fatalities are inevitable and caused by unforeseeable situations escalating out of control, but the majority of diving fatalities can be attributed to human error {{on the part of the}} victim. According to a North American 1972 analysis of calendar year 1970 data, diving was, based on man hours, 96 times more <b>dangerous</b> <b>than</b> driving a car. According to a 2000 Japanese study, every hour of recreational diving is 36 to 62 times riskier than driving.|$|E
5|$|Katherine Marlowe is {{the main}} {{antagonist}} of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. She is the coldly calculating leader of a secret society whose roots date back over four hundred years {{to the court of}} Queen Elizabeth I. She has a long-standing rivalry with Nathan Drake over Sir Francis Drake’s ring – something they both contend is rightfully theirs and is also the key to an ancient mystery. Katherine Marlowe is a much more cerebral enemy than Drake has confronted in the past, using both psychological and physical tactics to get what she is after. Marlowe also has the assistance of her team of highly trained agents in this secret society – they are far more elusive and <b>dangerous</b> <b>than</b> the hired guns Nathan Drake and Victor Sullivan have faced before. She treats her subordinates with slight disdain, getting annoyed with Talbot for hiring Charlie Cutter. Marlowe appears to have studied Nathan's past and reveals that he's not actually the direct decedent of Sir Francis Drake - he was merely in an orphanage named after the great explorer. She first meets a teenage Drake in Colombia, forcing him to give her the Cipher disk he had just stolen from a museum to her but fails to get Sir Francis Drakes ring when he runs off. Twenty years later, she meets with Drake in an Alleyway and steals his ring. However, she soon discovers it's a fake and promptly loses both the disc and the ring when Drake steals both. Marlowe then sends Talbot and her agents to France and Syria, successfully getting the clues to the location of Ubar. She then captures Nate and Sully and leaves for the lost city. Nathan eventually finds her using a winch to drag out King Solomon's hallucinogenic Talisman from the lakes in Ubar and destroys the foundations of the city, causing Marlowe to fall into a pool of quicksand. Though Drake attempts to save her, Marlowe submerges and dies.|$|E
