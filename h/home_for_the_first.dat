5|$|Auden began {{summering}} in Europe, {{together with}} Chester Kallman, in 1948, first in Ischia, Italy, where he rented a house, then, starting in 1958, in Kirchstetten, Austria, where {{he bought a}} farmhouse from the prize money of the Premio Feltrinelli awarded to him in 1957, and, he said, shed tears of joy at owning a <b>home</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time. In 1956–61, Auden was Professor of Poetry at Oxford University where he was required to give three lectures each year. This fairly light workload allowed him to continue to winter in New York, where he lived at 77 St. Mark's Place in Manhattan's East Village, and to summer in Europe, spending only three weeks each year lecturing in Oxford. He earned his income mostly from readings and lecture tours, and by writing for The New Yorker, The New York Review of Books, and other magazines.|$|E
5|$|Mochitsura Hashimoto {{was born}} in 1909 in Kyoto, Japan the eighth of nine {{children}} and fifth son of a kannushi (Shinto priest). He attended Kyoto Third High School, a prestigious school, where he performed well. In his youth he was described as self-possessed and respectful. At the behest of his father, he applied for the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy. The family {{did not have a}} naval background, but Hashimoto's father struggled financially on a priest's government subsidy and he felt entering his son into the military would help to provide for them. One of Hashimoto's older brothers subsequently attended the Imperial Japanese Army Academy and was commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Army. Hashimoto {{graduated from high school in}} 1927 and was accepted into the Naval Academy. Leaving <b>home</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> time, Hashimoto then attended the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy at Etajima for four years, studying Japanese history, engineering, and naval tactics, as well as judo and other military athletics.

He once again scored in his club's first leg match for the second Qualifying round of the 2008–09 UEFA Cup, against Lithuanian club FK Sūduva. He continued his scoring trends three days later for {{the first round of}} the ÖFB-Cup, in a 1–4 away win against Pasching. It took him almost a month to find the net again, as he scored the last goal in his club's 4–2 home win against Vöcklabrucker for the 2nd round of the ÖFB-Cup. A week later he managed to score the opening goal, in Red Bull Salzburg's 2–2 away draw against Sturm Graz. Until the end of the season he featured regularly in his team's matches, although mostly as a substitute, and only managed to score one more goal in a 4–1 home win against Austria Kärnten. At the end he counted 36 appearances with Red Bull Salzburg, of which 27 in the Bundesliga, six in the UEFA Cup and three in the ÖFB-Cup. Out of these matches he scored a total of eight goals, of which three in the Bundesliga, three in the UEFA Cup and two in the ÖFB-Cup.|$|E

To add to problems, both teams were likely to be missing some key members of the team as England were without some of their squad for their previous tour and, two days before Sri Lanka departed for England, it was revealed that skipper Marvan Atapattu would stay at home for the tour due to back problems that had forced him to skip his previous tour too. Jehan Mubarak was brought in as his replacement.|$|E

Glover {{was placed on the}} disabled list the next day and Joe Blanton was reactivated. On June 12, infielder Wilmer Difo — who had frozen up on a potential game-winning bunt single in the June 10 game while leading off third base, being tagged out in a rundown before an eventual Nationals 6–3 loss — was optioned to the Class-AAA Syracuse Chiefs. Reliever Trevor Gott was called up, giving the Nationals an eight-man bullpen as they headed into a series against the division rival Atlanta Braves. Gott picked up the win in his first game on June 13, with the Nationals defeating the Braves 10–5, but after a relief appearance the following day in which he was charged with five earned runs over 1⅔ innings, he was optioned back to Class-AAA Syracuse and left-hander Matt Grace recalled for a series against the division rival New York Mets beginning June 15. The Nationals took three out of four against the Mets, with Grace appearing in two games.|$|E
