The samples both were taken from automotive pistons and they also were prepared in the laboratory. In any case, they were used as basic raw materials for examination. It {{was found that the}} structure and properties of these alloys are very much dependent on the cooling rate, composition and heat treatment. The iron atoms are usually doped, in order to diminish and stabilize the thermal expansion coefficient of the alloys. However, this process makes the alloys to become harder and harder; thus leading the alloys to a degradation of their mechanical behavior at elevated temperatures. Optical Microscope observations, SEM analysis of the interactive surface layers and XRD measurements were performed on tested samples. At elevated temperatures a large <b>homogenized</b> <b>zone</b> extended to about 500 (µm) without an apparent distribution of the silicon dendrites or faceted crystals was formed. Moreover at the surface of the so called <b>homogenized</b> <b>zone</b> a layer of about 35 (µm) was formed inside of which iron atoms were migrated. This layer is mainly responsible for scuffing phenomena...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFinite element {{modeling}} {{of the impact}} of flexible woven fabrics using a yarn level architecture allows the capturing of complex projectile-fabric and yarn–yarn level interactions, however it requires very large computational resources. This paper presents a multiscale modeling technique to simulate the impact of flexible woven fabrics. This technique involves modeling the fabric using a yarn level architecture around the impact region and a homogenized or membrane type architecture at far field regions. The level of modeling resolution decreases with distance away from the impact zone. This results in a finite element model with much lower computational requirements. The yarns are modeled using both solid and shell finite elements. Impedances are matched across all interfaces created between the various regions of the model to prevent artificial reflections of the longitudinal strain waves. A systematic approach is presented to determine geometric and material parameters of the <b>homogenized</b> <b>zone.</b> The multiscale model is extensively validated against baseline models. The limitations of using shell elements to model the yarn level architecture underneath the projectile are addressed...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this thesis is to develop an economical computational method for multidimensional transient analysis of nuclear power reactors. Specifically, the application of nodal methods based on the multigroup diffusion theory approximation to reactors composed of regular arrays of large homogeneous (or <b>homogenized)</b> <b>zones</b> was investigated. A nodal scheme is formulated using the response matrix approach as a conceptual basis. Solutions of equivalent sets of coupled one dimensional problems are used to treat the local multidimensional response problems. Polynomial expansions in conjunction with weighted residual procedures are employed to obtain approximate solutions of the one-dimensional problems. A linear set of nodal equations {{expressed in terms of}} nodal average fluxes and interface average partial currents is obtained. Applications to two-dimensional few-group, static and transient problems demonstrate that the nodal scheme can be an order of magnitude more computationally efficient than conventional finite difference methods.

40|$|In the {{carbonate}} {{deposits of}} the upper Olenekian (Križna Nappe) and the Lower Anisian (High-Tatric Unit, Giewont Nappe) from the Tatra Mts (Western Carpathians) were recognized two sedimentary intervals containing beds with soft-sediment deformation structures (SSDS). The first interval consists of dolostones and limestones which contain following deformation structures: folds, faults, breccias and <b>homogenized</b> <b>zones.</b> The second interval is built of limestones with sigmoidally deformed veins which are interbedded with horizontally laminated limestones lacking any deformations. The deformed beds were considered as seismites {{on the basis of}} the following criteria: large lateral extent, lateral continuity of deformed sediments, vertical repetition and, morphology of SSDS comparable with structures described from earthquake-affected layers. Two other criteria necessary for recognition of seismites, i. e., the proximity to active faults and decreasing of complexity or frequency of SSDS with the increasing distance from the triggering fault are not applicable to the described succession due to Late Cretaceous tectonic movements. The presence of the described seismites does not only confirm earlier hypotheses about Anisian tectonic activity of the discussed area but also proves that the tectonic movements started already during the late Olenekian in the study area...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The homogenization of sediment from shearing forms traps in both the hanging wall and footwall due to capillary pressure differences. The sheared zone associated with large faults can form traps. Sheared zones associated with small faults can compartmentalize reservoirs leading to unreliable estimates of reserves. Measured values of capillary pressure were compared with estimated capillary pressure values from four correlation methods. Based on comparison of estimated pressure with measured pressure, Pittman's method gave the most reliable results for predicting capillary pressure and therefore the height of the oil column. However, all methods for predicting capillary pressure worked well for samples with porosities above 20 % and permeabilities above 100 md. Hydrocarbon column heights were then determined from the capillary pressure values. The large sheared zone of the Cities Service Dincans 1 (CD 1) well, Toro Grande field, Jackson County, has a predicted trapping capacity of up to 1, 961 ft of oil at 10, 000 ft depth and 35 % saturation of oil. Shearing is mostly at the hand specimen scale in the General Crude Kirby Lumber 2 (GCK 2) well, East Sour Lake field, Hardin County, which has a maximum trapping capacity of 111 ft. From this study, it is then concluded that a <b>homogenized</b> sheared <b>zone,</b> formed from ductile deformation of sand and shale layers can form a trap to hydrocarbons. Sheared zones may be thick zones, on the order of feet, or smaller zones at microscopic or hand specimen scale. The larger the sheared zone is, the greater the trapping capacity of the fault...|$|R
40|$|An {{analytic}} model and calculational methodology was previously developed for P-reactor and R-reactor {{to quantify the}} radioisotopes present in Savannah River Site (SRS) reactor tanks and the surrounding structural materials {{as a result of}} neutron activation of the materials during reactor operation. That methodology has been extended to K-reactor, L-reactor, and C-reactor. The analysis was performed to provide a best-estimate source term input to the Performance Assessment for an in-situ disposition strategy by Site Decommissioning and Demolition (SDD). The reactor structure model developed earlier for the P-reactor and R-reactor analyses was also used for the K-reactor and L-reactor. The model was suitably modified to handle the larger Creactor tank and associated structures. For all reactors, the structure model consisted of 3 annular <b>zones,</b> <b>homogenized</b> by the amount of structural materials in the zone, and 5 horizontal layers. The curie content on an individual radioisotope basis and total basis for each of the regions was determined. A summary of these results are provided herein. The efficacy of this methodology to accurately predict the radioisotopic content of the reactor systems in question has been demonstrated and is documented in Reference 1. As noted in that report, results for one reactor facility cannot be directly extrapolated to other SRS reactors...|$|R
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIThe Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) has {{affected}} the population size and spatial distribution {{of a number of}} organisms in southern Patagonia. It has been hypothesized that species were able to persist in isolated refuges, which has generated processes of population expansion and genetic structure of populations after the LGM. In the present study, we evaluate these hypotheses and their association with local morphotypes in the endemic species Nyctelia confusa, a coleopteran that has low vagility and restricted distribution in the region. Accordingly, sixty-nine specimens were sequenced for the gene for mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I. Effective population size was estimated through time, along with population structure and the phylogenetic signal of the morphs. The results suggest the existence of recent population expansion (10 Kyr BP), although {{there was no evidence of}} population structure or the phylogenetic signal for the described morphs. We propose that, during the LGM, N. confusa survived in multiple refuges, probably in the oriental slopes of the Andes range. The surviving populations would have expanded once the steppe was re-established after the glaciers receded. This may have produced various secondary contact <b>zones,</b> <b>homogenizing</b> the genetic diversity, which would explain the observed pattern of panmixia. The morphological differentiation reported previously may be a result of local ecological adaptation not associated with the historical events of the LGM. CONICYT fellowship, FONDECYT, DIUC...|$|R
40|$|The Gacun polymetallic, Ag-rich, volcanic-hosted massive sulfide deposit {{occurs in}} a Triassic {{submarine}} calc-alkaline volcanic belt that forms part of the Yidun collisional orogenic zone of southwestern China. The deposit is hosted in felsic volcanic rocks associated with an underlying mafic unit (a bimodal suite), which formed in an intra-arc rift basin at about 1, 000 m water depth. The volcanic rocks underwent regional lower greenschist facies metamorphism and related deformation during the Yanshan-Himalayan orogeny, resulting in folding and shearing of the ore lenses. The deposit {{is made up of}} three mineralized zones: a sheet-like upper massive sulfide zone with exhalite (barite, chert, and jasper), a middle stringer-stockwork strata-bound zone hosted in rhyolitic volcanic rocks, and an underlying lower stringer strata-bound zone in dacitic volcanic rocks. Fluid inclusion studies indicate that two-phase primary fluid inclusions in quartz in the lower stringer ore <b>zone</b> <b>homogenized</b> between 299 ° and 319 °C (average temperature 308 °C), whereas those in sphalerite yielded a temperature range from 185 ° to 260 °C (average temperature 241 °C). Homogenization temperatures of fluid inclusions in quartz from the middle stringer-stockwork zone ranged from 150 ° to 350 °C and averaged 243 °C. The homogenization temperature of fluid inclusions in quartz and sphalerite from the massive sulfide zone show a bimodal distribution corresponding to temperatures from 250 ° to 150 °C for quartz and from 200 ° t...|$|R
40|$|Histotripsy is a cavitational {{ultrasound}} therapy which mechanically fractionates {{soft tissue}} into subcellular debris using high intensity short ultrasound pulses. Histotripsy {{can be an}} effective tool for many clinical applications where non-invasive tissue removal is desired, including tumor therapy. For non-invasive tissue ablation therapy like histotripsy, image based feedback information allowing for accurate targeting, optimization of the on-going process, and prediction of the treatment efficacy in real time is the key to successful treatments. The overall goal of this research is to develop image based feedback methods that can accurately predict the clinical outcomes during and after histotripsy treatments. To achieve this goal, the research was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, new treatment strategies were investigated to produce homogeneous tissue fractionation. This ensures that feedback metrics obtained with any tissue characterization method are representative of the whole lesion instead of a misleading average of fully <b>homogenized</b> and non-homogenized <b>zones.</b> Specifically, two treatment strategies were developed. A focal zone sharpening technique, which limited the spatial extent of cavitation by preconditioning the cavitation nuclei in the surrounding area, was developed to create highly confined lesions with minimum scattered damage in the lesion boundaries. A cavitation memory removal strategy, which allowed for random distribution of cavitation in response to each therapy pulse, was developed to produce homogeneously fractionated lesions with a dramatically reduced therapy dose. In the second stage, three ultrasound image based methods were investigated to provide quantitative feedback information regarding the degree of tissue damage. These methods included ultrasound backscatter intensity analysis, ultrasound shear wave elasticity imaging, and characterization of shear wave propagation patterns. Strong correlations existed between the quantitative metrics derived from these methods and the degree of tissue fractionation as examined with histology, demonstrating the feasibility of using these metrics as quantitative feedback for histotripsy treatments. In conclusion, this research demonstrates that histotripsy can be a highly controllable tissue ablation therapy via precise control of cavitation. Significant potential exists for histotripsy to be developed into an image-guided modality for noninvasive ultrasound tissue ablation therapy...|$|R
