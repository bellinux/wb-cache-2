40|$|Abstract — With {{the advent}} of {{cognitive}} radio technology, new paradigms for spectrum access can achieve near-optimal <b>spectrum</b> <b>utilisation</b> by letting each user sense and utilise available spectrum opportunistically while regulating the interference it imposes on other users through interference constraints. However, the simplest and most common forms of such constraints are binary and transmitter-centric, which are often inefficient since they only consider pair-wise sets of transmitters. Hence, we propose a non-binary receiver-centric constraint model for spectrum access in cognitive radio networks. Such a model {{is in line with}} the recently proposed interference temperature metric that constraints whole subsets of transmitters, thereby permitting interfering signals to be introduced and enabling additional communication, leading to improved <b>spectrum</b> <b>utilisation.</b> These constraints are easy to generate and check, and are currently being used to devise a co-operative negotiated etiquette for cognitive radios offering heterogeneous services in a wireless office networking scenario.

In this article, we propose a radio system Transmission Opportunity-based spectrum access control protocol with the aim to improve spectrum access fairness and ensure safe coexistence of multiple heterogeneous unlicensed radio systems. In the scheme, multiple radio systems will coexist and dynamically use available free spectrum without interfering with licensed users.

40|$|The radio {{frequency}} (RF) spectrum is a scarce natural resource, currently regulated by government agencies. With the explosive emergence of wireless applications, {{the demands for}} the RF spectrum are constantly increasing. On the other hand, {{it has been reported}} that localised temporal and geographic <b>spectrum</b> <b>utilisation</b> efficiency is extremely low. Cognitive radio is an innovative technology designed to improve <b>spectrum</b> <b>utilisation</b> by exploiting those spectrum opportunities. This ability is dependent upon spectrum sensing, which is one of most critical components in a cognitive radio system. A significant challenge is to sense the whole RF spectrum at a particular physical location in a short observation time. Otherwise, performance degrades with longer observation times since the lagging response to spectrum holes implies low <b>spectrum</b> <b>utilisation</b> efficiency. Hence, developing an efficient wideband spectrum sensing technique is prime important. In this thesis, a multirate asynchronous sub-Nyquist sampling (MASS) system that employs multiple low-rate analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) is developed that implements wideband spectrum sensing. The key features of the MASS system are, 1) low implementation complexity, 2) energy-efficiency for sharing spectrum sensing data, and 3) robustness against the lack of time synchronisation. The conditions under which recovery of the full spectrum is unique are presented using compressive sensing (CS) analysis. The MASS system is applied to both centralised and distributed cognitive radio networks. When the spectra of the cognitive radio nodes have a common spectral support, using one low-rate ADC in each cognitive radio node can successfully recover the full spectrum. This is obtained by applying a hybrid matching pursuit (HMP) algorithm - a synthesis of distributed compressive sensing simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (DCS-SOMP) and compressive sampling matching pursuit (CoSaMP). Moreover, a multirate spectrum detection (MSD) system is introduced to detect the primary users from a small number of measurements without ever reconstructing the full spectrum. To achieve a better detection performance, a data fusion strategy is developed for combining sensing data from all cognitive radio nodes. Theoretical bounds on detection performance are derived for distributed cognitive radio nodes suffering from additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), Rayleigh fading, and log-normal fading channels. In conclusion, MASS and MSD both have a low implementation complexity, high energy efficiency, good data compression capability, and are applicable to distributed cognitive radio networks.

Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) has been proposed {{as a means of}} improving the <b>spectrum</b> <b>utilisation</b> of wireless systems. Based on the Cognitive Radio (CR) paradigm, DSA enables unlicensed spectrum users to sense their spectral environment and adapt their operational parameters to opportunistically access any temporally unoccupied bands without causing interference to the primary spectrum users. In the same context, CR inspired Machine-to-Machine (M 2 M) communications have recently been proposed as a potential solution to the <b>spectrum</b> <b>utilisation</b> problem, which has been driven by the ever increasing number of interconnected devices. M 2 M communications introduce new challenges for CR in terms of operational environments and design requirements. With spectrum sensing being the key function for CR, this thesis investigates the performance of spectrum sensing and proposes novel sensing approaches and models to address the sensing problem for cognitive M 2 M deployments. In this thesis, the behaviour of Energy Detection (ED) spectrum sensing for cognitive M 2 M nodes is modelled using the two-wave with dffi use power fading model. This channel model can describe a variety of realistic fading conditions including worse than Rayleigh scenarios that are expected to occur within the operational environments of cognitive M 2 M communication systems. The results suggest that ED based spectrum sensing fails to meet the sensing requirements over worse than Rayleigh conditions and consequently requires the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to be increased by up to 137...|$|R
