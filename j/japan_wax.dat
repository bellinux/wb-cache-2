50|$|Wax or the Discovery of Television Among the Bees was {{the first}} film on the Internet. Wax is the first {{independent}} feature film by American filmmaker and artist David Blair. Released in 1991, Wax was a cult hit, playing cinemas in 26 U.S. cities and had additional theatrical play in <b>Japan</b> and Australia. <b>Wax</b> was a co-production with ZDF, German Television, and opened theatrically to rave reviews at the Public Theater in New York. Wax was included {{in a number of}} 10 Best Film lists that year.|$|R
30|$|The {{amount of}} {{reducing}} sugars liberated was determined using the Dinitrosalicylic acid method with xylose/glucose as standard (Miller 1959). Ethanol concentration was analyzed by Gas chromatography (GC) (Shimadzu 2010, <b>Japan)</b> using ZB <b>Wax</b> column (30 mm ×  0 · 25  mm) with a {{flame ionization detector}} (FID). The analysis was performed according to NREL (National Renewable Energy Laboratory) procedure LAP # 001. The conditions used were: 150  °C (isothermal), program run time: 5.5  min, ethanol retention time: 2.3  min and the carrier gas: nitrogen (16  kPa), injector temperature: 175  °C, detector temperature: 250  °C, flow rate: 40  ml/min, spilt ratio: 1 / 50, velocity of H 2 flow: 60  ml/min and sample quantity: 1  μl. The supernatant was filtered by 0.22  μm cellulose acetate filters prior to GC analysis (Srilekha Yadav et al. 2011).|$|R

50|$|On {{his return}} from the Chittagong hill Tracts, he worked as art {{director}} for an advertising agency in Karachi until 1971, following which he turned to designing sets for a National dance ensemble for nearly two years. During the same period, he visited China and <b>Japan,</b> studying Lost <b>Wax</b> Bronze casting technique under Japanese sculptor Akio Kato whom he acknowledges as his only master. Shahid held a solo exhibition of wood and bronze sculptures at the Karachi Arts Council in 1974 and won the first prize in sculpture at the National Exhibition in Islamabad in 1977. A year later,he exhibited his bronze work at Atelier BM,Karachi. Shahid was commissioned by the Pakistan Army to execute a mural in bronze, later titled 'Cavalry through the Ages' that he completed in 1981. He was awarded national prize for sculpture in 1982.|$|R
50|$|Traditional wax-based eye liners {{are made}} from about 20 components. About 50% by weight are waxes (e.g., <b>Japan</b> <b>wax,</b> fats, or related soft {{materials}} that easily glide on to the skin. Typical pigments include black iron oxides, as well as smaller amounts of titanium dioxide and Prussian blue.|$|E
50|$|<b>Japan</b> <b>wax,</b> {{also known}} as sumac wax (alternatively spelled sumach wax), {{vegetable}} wax, China green tallow, and Japan tallow, is a pale-yellow, waxy, water-insoluble solid with a gummy feel, obtained from the berries of certain sumacs native to Japan and China, such as Toxicodendron vernicifluum (lacquer tree) and Toxicodendron succedaneum (Japanese wax tree).|$|E
50|$|Like lipstick, lip liner is {{composed}} of waxes, oils, and pigments. Compared to lipstick, lip liners are firmer in consistency and deeply pigmented, making them suitable for drawing on to the lip with precision. For these reasons, lip liners have less oils and more waxes and pigments than a lipsticks. A popular wax is <b>Japan</b> <b>wax.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Nomenclature {{of the era}} {{indicated}} the [...]45-75 cartridge contained a 0.45 in diameter bullet with 75 gr g of gunpowder. Early Winchester ammunition boxes suggested reloading empty cartridge cases with government musket powder or with American Powder Company Deadshot Fg, Hazard Powder Company Sea Shooting Fg, DuPont Rifle FFg, Oriental Powder Company Western Sporting Fg, Laflin & Rand Orange Rifle Fg, or Austin Powder Company Rifle Powder FFg. Boxes also recommended casting bullets from an alloy of one part tin and sixteen parts lead and lubricating bullets with <b>Japan</b> <b>wax</b> or tallow.|$|E
50|$|In East Asia, in {{particular}} in Japan, traditional candle fuel was produced from Toxicodendron vernicifluum (synonym: Rhus verniciflua) and Toxicodendron succedaneum (synonym: Rhus succedanea), among other sumac plants in the genus Toxicodendron, rather than beeswax or animal fats. The sumac wax was a byproduct of traditional Japanese lacquer manufacture. The conical rousoku candles produced from sumac wax burn with smokeless flame and were favored in many respects over candles made from lard or beeswax during the Tokugawa shogunate. <b>Japan</b> <b>wax</b> is not a true wax but a solid fat that contains 10-15% palmitin, stearin, and olein with about 1% japanic acid (1,21-heneicosanedioic acid). It is still used in many tropical and subtropical countries {{in the production of}} wax match sticks.|$|E
5000|$|Tallow or lard {{was used}} as a {{lubricant}} to ease the insertion of muzzle loaded bullets. [...] Elongated rifle bullets were designed to be cast with grooves encircling the bullet to provide a reservoir for lubricant. These lubricants softened the black powder fouling for easier removal and reduced the tendency of bullets to leave deposits of lead in the barrel as they were fired. The latter advantage continued to be significant with smokeless powder. Attempts to obtain satisfactory high-velocity performance with cast bullets have included experimentation with a variety of lubricant mixtures including such things as beeswax, carnuba wax, <b>Japan</b> <b>wax,</b> bayberry wax, paraffin, petroleum jelly, sperm oil, castor oil, stearyl alcohol, lauryl alcohol, graphite, molybdenum disulphide, mica, zinc oxide, Teflon, cup grease, lithium soap, water pump grease, and a variety of more modern lubricating materials.|$|E

40|$|The {{pigments}} {{and paint}} binders used by Edvard Munch {{have been investigated}} in several studies. Munch used a mixture of media in his works of art. The two versions of The Scream studied here were found to include oil paints and oil paints thickened with beeswax and also oil crayons containing beeswax and <b>Japan</b> <b>wax,</b> as well as casein pastels, a paraffin wax crayon {{and at least one}} gum-bound paint. His sketches on canvas make use of oil paints and tempera paints including egg and casein, as well as casein pastels in at least one instance. His oil paintings on canvas seem to have been executed using a more conventional technique, with most having one or a few paint layers bound with linseed oil on a ground formed from lead white in oil on top of a ground made of chalk in glue. Munch's palette is not extensive, though he was reasonably willing to introduce new materials, such as his use of a petroleum-based wax crayon in 1893, oil pastel - possibly as early as 1893 and certainly by 1910, and his use of cadmium red by 1927 - 1929. The identification of materials has informed conservators who are planning and carrying out conservation treatment...|$|E
40|$|From Introduction: Wax and wax-like {{substances}} {{have been}} defined in many ways. One reasonably extensive definition, by Hatt and Lamberton (1956) is given below: "The term "wax" seems best used to denote {{a group of}} substances which qualitatively have certain physical properties in common. These properties are familiar ones, for in almost all countries some natural wax - beeswax, <b>Japan</b> <b>wax,</b> Chinese insect wax, the carnauba and candelilla waxes of the Americas - {{has been an important}} material in art and industry from prehistoric times. Waxes are understood to be opaque or translucent solids, which melt without decomposition to form mobile liquids at temperatures in the region of 100 ⁰C. They differ in hardness, but are all essentially soft substances with poor mechanical strength. Most waxes can be easily shaped or kneaded at a little above ambient temperatures. In fact, the term could easily have been made to cover the whole class now named thermoplastics. " Pure n-paraffins would be too crystalline and brittle for use as waxes, whereas mixtures of n-paraffins have some valuable properties. The molecules bear such close resemblance to one another that they form mixed crystals of lowered crystallinity and the melting point {{is a function of the}} mean molecular weight. This is a desirable feature for it permits crystallinity and brittleness to be reduced without a marked loss in the melting point or hardness. It also allows a mixture to simulate a pure compound very closely. Waxes, in general, have been put to a large number of uses. They are used, for example, in candles, polishes, paper-coating, plastics, printing, matches, rust protectants and insulation. Each application requires its own appropriate range of wax properties...|$|E
