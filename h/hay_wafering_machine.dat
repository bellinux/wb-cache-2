Four heifers, fed <b>hay</b> <b>wafer</b> and a commercial concentrate, {{were exposed to}} thermoneutral (20 degrees C) and hot (30 degrees C) environments. Glucose, arginine and butyrate (each injection at 0. 625 mmol/kg) and insulin (0. 2 U/kg) were injected intravenously, and then blood samples were collected at regular intervals through jugular vein catheters. Insulin secretion in response to glucose and arginine injection was not affected by heat exposure. However, the insulin response following butyrate injection was inhibited in heifers exposed to heat. In the hot environment, glucagon responses following the arginine and butyrate injections were augmented significantly, however glucagon levels were inhibited following the glucose injection. It is concluded that heat stress causes an inhibition of the insulin response to butyrate injection, {{and an increase in}} the glucagon response following arginine and butyrate injection.

This etch method is particularly effective just before [...] "backend" [...] processing (BEOL), where wafers are normally very much thinner after wafer backgrinding, and very sensitive to thermal or mechanical stress. Etching a thin layer of even a few micrometres will remove microcracks produced during backgrinding resulting in the wafer having dramatically increased strength and flexibility without breaking.|$|R

Glucose, arginine, butyrate, and insulin were administered through one jugular catheter, and from a catheter {{on the other side}} venous blood was collected. The peak increments in plasma insulin after the glucose and butyrate administrations were lower during heat exposure. The response of insulin after arginine injection was smaller in the hot compared with the thermoneutral environment; however, arginine injection resulted in a significantly higher secretion of glucagon in the hot environment. The response area of insulin after the insulin injection was smaller in the hot environment; however, insulin clearance rate was not changed. It is concluded that in non-lactating cows, insulin release is probably lower during heat exposure. With respect to plasma glucose during heat exposure, the lower basal values, lower concentrations {{after the end of the}} glucose infusion, and delayed recovery to basal values after the butyrate and insulin administrations observed, may indicate lower gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in the hot environment.

40|$|Abstract – In this {{experimental}} work, {{by using}} the method of plasma-chemical etching, we {{have dealt with the}} causes of the creation of a distorted layer on the surface of silicon <b>wafers</b> during mechanical <b>machining</b> processes, in addition, the elucidation of connections between the structure of this layer and characteristic parameters of the mechanical strength of these wafers have been studied. Experimental results obtained at room temperature show that after cutting and grinding processes, the mean value of mechanical strength σ, which is apparently independent of the types of conductivity, is significantly lower than its theoretical value. Analysis of the dependence of mechanical parameters on the time of plasma-chemical etching indicates that the lower values obtained for the mechanical strength of silicon wafers is basically due to the existence of a distorted layer and corresponding internal stresses created on the surface of these <b>wafers</b> after mechanical <b>machining.</b> Plasma-chemical etching leads to an increase in σ value. Dependency of σ on the etching time is qualitatively described by the microstructure of the distorted layer and parameters of the micro relief surface of the wafers.

40|$|Semiconductor <b>wafer</b> <b>machining</b> {{that enables}} the wafers to be used {{practically}} must achieve a damage-free subsurface. This requires a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of deformation of the semiconductor materials involved in the machining processes. In this thesis, the deformations of monocrystalline Silicon (Si) under nanoscratching and nanogrinding were systematically investigated. The experimental results demonstrated that lateral force in nanoscratching/nanogrinding {{played a key role}} in the amorphization and the phase transformation of Si. Those results were compared with the well-documented deformation mechanisms induced by nanoindentation. Subsurface crystalline defects, such as stacking faults, dislocations, and twins were observed in the scratched/ground Si samples. The existence of high pressure phases embedded in amorphous Si was discovered when a relatively high load was used in nanoscratching or when large diamond grit sizes were employed during nanogrinding. No cracks were observed under the experimental conditions used. The formation sequence of the deformations was determined. The deformations of monocrystalline gallium arsenide (GaAs) under nanoscratching and nanogrinding were also thoroughly studied. It was found that no amorphization occurred. Twins, dislocations, and cracks were found to be the main deformation mechanisms involved in nanoscratching and nanogrinding of GaAs. An extraordinary phenomenon, i. e. lattice bending, was observed when the scratching/grinding pressure was sufficiently high. Residual stress was suggested to be responsible for this lattice bending. By comparing the nanoscratching/nanogrinding-induced deformations of Si and GaAs, it was noted that amorphization was always the first-induced deformation for Si, whereas no amorphization was observed in the scratched or ground GaAs. This raised a question: what were the mechanisms responsible for the different deformations in those two semiconductor materials? To answer this question, the theory of stacking fault energy was employed. Consequently, the deformation mechanisms of semiconductor materials were related to their intrinsic properties. It was proposed that amorphization was less likely to occur in a semiconductor material with relatively low stacking fault energy. To verify this hypothesis, cadmium zinc telluride (CdZnTe, CZT – with a very low stacking fault energy) was investigated under nanoscratching and nanogrinding. No amorphization was observed in the scratched or ground CZT samples, which was in excellent agreement with the hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|Harmonic drives are {{increasingly}} used in precision positioning {{applications such as}} military radars, <b>wafer</b> handling <b>machines,</b> and satellite cameras. Precision tracking performance of these drives is deteriorated by nonlinear transmission attributes including kinematic error, flexibility, hysteresis and friction. Hence characterization and compensation of these nonlinear attributes is crucial to improve the precision in tracking and regulation. This paper focuses on modeling, identification, and compensation of nonlinear friction in harmonic drives. Harmonic drive friction models presented in the literature {{are found to be}} a combination of Coulomb and viscous friction. However, a dynamic friction phenomenon exhibits, in addition to Coulomb and viscous frictions, other nonlinear phenomena including the Dahl effect, and the Stribeck effect which must be considered in an accurate friction model.

Complete characterization of friction in harmonic drives is carried out in this paper by using a recently developed LuGre (Lund-Grenobel) friction model superimposed with a new posit ion-dependent part.

This increase in yield {{may be attributed to}} several factors characterized by focused ionbeam sputter etching. First, since the machined hole lies very close to the bombardment area, the incident angular dependence and side ward sputtering phenomena cause an increase in the effective sputtering yield (Shape Effect).

Lithography {{is one of the}} most important and critical steps in semiconductor wafer manufacturing. It is directly responsible for shrinking feature sizes to increase transistor densities.

40|$|Abstract Three {{companies}} namely Esko & Co Ltd, Cuttings Work Ltd and The Message Ltd {{were targeted}} {{for the purpose}} of this project study. The first one is Esko & Co Ltd. The company has diversified its production activities to produce sweets, bubble gums, chocolates, wafers and noodles both for the local market and export purposes. Cuttings Works Ltd is the second leading company in the manufacturing of top grade products using the best possible gemstones for the jewellery grade. The company is also diversifying and expanding its market. On the other hand ‘The message Ltd’ is another company involved in the designing and make up of high class casual wear. Previously the company was only designing and preparing samples and the bulk order done in another textile factory. With respect to the highly demanding market, they have now started the production of their shirts in-house. Being exposed to competition threats from other local and overseas suppliers, it is imperative for these factories to investigate on cost saving possibilities and process improvement opportunities. A walk-through audit was carried out where data were collected. The objective of the audit was to obtain energy savings through low cost improvements that optimise the building systems and process operation so that the companies operate efficiently and effectively. On the basis of observations and calculations, the following cost savings options can be suggested:’ 1.        Savings on Fuel (HFO) used at Esko & Co Ltd. A saving on fuel consumed of MUR 458 572 [PH 1] (Euro 11 464 based on exchange rate of Euro 1 = MUR 40) per year can be achieved by recovering the heat loss through the flash steam for pre-heating the feed-water to the boiler. Another saving on fuel of MUR 105 578 (Euro 2639) per year can be done by recovering the heat loss from the <b>Wafers</b> <b>machine</b> exhaust. Also by recovering the heat loss from the boiler chimney exhaust a saving of MUR 137 457 (Euro 3436) per year can be achieved. 2.        Savings on Electrical components. It was found that in a big manufacturing company like Esko & Co Ltd, a direct saving of MUR 13 278 (Euro 332) per year can easily be achieved by substituting the existing Fluorescent tube lights (18 W) by 9 W-T 8 lamp with a return on investment of 2. 8 years. However in smaller scale enterprise like The Message ltd and Cuttings Ltd, the shift on economic lamp can also lead to savings of MUR 3700 (Euro 92. 5) and MUR 1386 (Euro 34. 7) yearly. Most often large scale enterprise was found to be always paying a penalty fee for power factor. Hence the investment on an Automatic Correction Unit will also help doing savings. For instance, Esko & Co Ltd can save MUR 3200 (Euro 80) monthly on its electricity bill with a payback of 3. 1 years for the power corrector unit. Next we noticed that big companies are used to a penalty fee for power factor. As this fee is for a period of six months for every month of excess power consumed, it is worth investing on an Automatic Power Correction unit. As such foe Esko & Co Ltd we found that a saving of MUR 3200 Euro 80) per month will be made with a payback period of 3. 1 years for the equipment. Furthermore it was found that the power consumed by air conditioning units is quite significant. For instance for Esko & Co Ltd 33 % of the total power consumed are by the air conditioning units. A direct saving in this respect is achievable by only increasing the set point temperature by 1 to 2 oC. Other simple measures can be shading of windows to prevent sunlight or using wind curtains at doors and to switch on the AC when needed can largely help to decrease the air conditioning load However there is also room for future investment in variable speed drive for the compressors of the air conditioning units which is still costly at present. 3.        Steam leakage optimisation Reduction of steam leakage can be done by replacing the return condensate line from the oil heat exchanger at Esko& Co Ltd by a smaller one. It was not possible to calculate the savings as the leaks could not be measured – however results will show in the fuel bills. 4.        Reduction of heat dissipated Insulating the exhaust pipes from the <b>Wafer</b> <b>machine</b> at Esko& Co Ltd by using mineral wool of thickness 57 mm will considerably decrease the heat dissipated to the surrounding by 80 % and hence improving the working environment around the machine since no air conditioner is found in that room. Air conditioning load in other rooms are expected to reduce and once again here it is difficult to conduct any calculations on how much can be saved. But by taking this measure the effects are immediately seen. 5.        Transport Fuel optimisation Normally big companies like Esko& Co Ltd which has many lorries for their product delivery that consume around 2330 litres of diesel monthly. As the transportation fuel is continuously increasing, this area also requires monitoring and optimisation. Simple measures like smooth driving, regular tuning and servicing of your engine can help improving the fuel economy of the company. 6.        Use of solar energy To alleviate the increasing world oil prices, the use of renewable energies are becoming important. As such we found that in a country like Mauritius where there is great potential for solar energy, the latter can be an option for companies to invest on. It was found that a grid connected system will be more advantageous and depending on an agreement with the local grid, a payback of less than 5 years can be achieved for a tariff around MUR 3 (Euro 0. 08) per kWh. 7.        Avoided carbon dioxide emissions. To decrease the impact of global warming, it is important to cut down the emissions of greenhouse gases as it will be a serious threat to the third world countries and small island states in the first place as they are the most vulnerable. With the savings in the amount of HFO burned at Esko& Co Ltd, we found that the avoided amount of GHG emissions amounts to 98. 96 kg CO 2 -e/year...|$|R

To improve efficiency in such systems, this thesis proposes an adaptive dynamic routing approach {{that allows the}} system to self-regulate, reducing steady-state travel times by 4 - 6 % and avoiding excessive congestion and deadlock. Our approach allows vehicles to be rerouted while in progress in response {{to changes in the}} location and severity of congestion as measured by edge traversal time estimates updated via exponential smoothing.

The model has been used to simulate a feedback control loop that adjusts the bearing supply flow such that changes in load can be compensated and theoretically infinite stiffness can be reached. In first experiments on a specially designed test setup the measured static stiffness of the single pocket test bearing could be increased by a factor 8 (load range 45 to 270 N). The dynamic stiffness of the bearing could be increased by a factor of 2. 5. by Gerald S. Rothenhöfer. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Advances in {{photolithography}} {{are one of}} the key driving {{factors in}} the continuing expansion in capacity and decrease in cost of semiconductors. Extending this trend into the future necessitates the development of next-generation lithography technologies in order to overcome the fundamental challenges of improving critical dimension and overlay control, and lowering the total cost-of-ownership. As feature sizes become smaller and smaller, performance requirements for <b>wafer</b> scanner <b>machines</b> will become more stringent; with regards to motion control, requirements for the wafer stage include sub-nanometer positioning precision under high scan velocities and accelerations. Advanced control algorithms are needed to meet these requirements in the face of disturbances such as vibrations, noise, force ripple and friction, as well as model uncertainty. This dissertation focuses on using the repetitiveness of the stage's motion in the photolithography process to improve control precision. Similar to many manufacturing processes, the step-and-scan motion used to expose a wafer is very repetitive, on a die-to-die and also wafer-to-wafer level. By using data gathered from past runs, the control effort for future runs may be improved, thereby exploiting the repetitiveness of the process to increase control precision. In this research, iterative learning control (ILC) and iterative feedback tuning (IFT) were applied to reduce tracking error of the wafer stage. In ILC, a feedforward control signal for the system is incrementally adjusted to achieve better tracking performance using error signals from previous runs. ILC is an attractive method for high-precision control because of its simplicity and data-based nature. In this research, ILC algorithm design specifically for attenuating high frequency vibrations is investigated. Through careful design of the ILC update law, fast learning convergence and small final error is achieved. One drawback of ILC is that a feedforward signal learned through ILC is only applicable to the training trajectory; learning must be restarted when the trajectory is changed. A method is presented for making ILC results applicable to any trajectory within a class of scan trajectories; this is accomplished by using ILC as a training method for feedforward signal patterns. In IFT, controller parameters are fine-tuned incrementally using only data collected in experimental runs. IFT is applied to tune fixed-structure feedforward, feedback, and force-ripple compensator controllers. The performance of IFT is also compared with ILC in the context of iterative methods for designing feedforward control. All results are verified through computer simulations and experiments done on a wafer stage testbed system...|$|R
40|$|Next {{generation}} precision machines {{will require}} ever more rigid elements {{to achieve the}} required machining tolerances. The presented work focuses on the application of ultra stiff servo-controllable kinematic couplings and hydrostatic bearings to minimize the structural loop of multi-axis precision grinding machines while reducing complexity. The fundamental importance of these ultra stiff, adjustable machine elements is demonstrated {{in the design of}} a grinding machine for 450 mm diameter silicon wafers. A new generation of silicon <b>wafer</b> grinding <b>machines</b> is needed to back-grind large (450 mm diameter) wafers from the production thickness of up to 1 mm down to less than 50 pm so as to reduce the cost of Si-wafer based components. The grinding process {{needs to be done in}} about 90 sec (fine-grinding, e. g. - 200 micron) to 160 sec (coarse grinding, e. g. - 600 micron). After completion of the fine grinding process the wafer must be flat to 0. 1 pm/o 45 mm and parallel to 0. 6 pm/ 450 mm diameter. The surface roughness must be less than Rymax 0. 1 pm and Ra 0. 01 pm. Even though the required machining forces are 1 N/nm is required, which is many times stiffer than a typical machine tool (0. 1 to 0. 3 N/nm). In cooperation with industry, this work had the aim of creating a new machine design philosophy, with an example application that focuses on nano-adjustable kinematic coupling and feedback controlled water hydrostatic bearing technology. This new design philosophy is needed to enable the design of a relatively small footprint, compact precision machines. In particular, a ball screw preloaded height adjustable kinematic coupling and a magnetically preloaded hydrostatic thrust bearing were designed and built. The adjustable kinematic coupling allows for up to 8 mm of vertical height adjust and 7 N/nm stiffness at 26 kN preload. By varying the preload on the coupling by +/- 10 %, in-process nm to micron height and tilt adjustment at > 95 % of the nominal stiffness is possible. Under the assumption of a constant flow supply, the hydrostatic bearing achieves a theoretical stiffness of 1 N/ nm at a 20 micron bearing gap and 7000 N combined gravitational and magnetic preload. In practice, the stiffness is limited by the pressure flow characteristics of the supplying pumps. To increase the bearing stiffness to a required 4 N/ nm, various control loops have been developed and tested. by Gerald Rothenhöfer. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Abstract—Semiconductor wafer fab {{operations}} {{are characterized by}} complex and reentrant production processes over many heterogeneous machine groups with stringent performance requirements. Efficient composition of good scheduling policies from combinatorial options of <b>wafer</b> release and <b>machine</b> dispatching rules has posed a significant challenge to competitive fab operations. In this paper, we design a fast simulation-based methodology by an innovative integration of ordinal optimization (OO) and design of experiments (DOEs) to efficiently select a good scheduling policy for fab operations. Instead of finding the exact performance among scheduling policies, our approach compares their relative orders of performance to a specified level of confidence. Our new approach consists of three stages: performance estimation model construction using DOE, policy option screening process, and final simulation evaluation with intelligent computing budget allocation. The exponential convergence of OO is integrated into all the three stages to significantly improve computational efficiency. Simulation results of applications to scheduling wafer fabrications not only screen out good scheduling policies but also provide insights about how factors such as wafer release and the dispatching of each machine group may affect production cycle times and smoothness under a reentrant process flow. Most of the OO-based DOE simulations require 2 – 3 orders of magnitude less computation time than those of a traditional approach. Such a high speedup enables decision makers to explore much larger problems. Note to Practitioners—This paper designs a fast simulation-based methodology to compose a good scheduling policy from various dispatching rules of fab operations. The methodology innovatively applies DOE to estimate performance of dispatching rule combinations (policies) over various machines groups in a fab, screens out good enough policy options by using OO over the performance estimation, and allocates computation time intelli...|$|R
