5|$|Another survivor, Radomir Krnjajić, {{recalled}} {{that they were}} fed a variety of foods, including pumpkin soup, cucumbers, beets and similar vegetables, and sometimes received a little macaroni or beans, but very little bread. The historian Ivan Fumić concludes that the children were systematically punished for various infractions, and were treated harshly by the Ustaše {{and the majority of}} the nuns. Some of the nuns at the camp, however, <b>did</b> <b>show</b> love and attention to the children. Gojko Knežević, another camp survivor, recounted many years later that the nuns beat the children with birch branches dipped in salt water or vinegar.|$|E
5|$|However, an {{analysis}} of the distribution of megalodon over time suggests that climate change did not {{play a major role in}} its extinction. Its distribution during the Miocene and Pliocene did not correlate with warming and cooling trends; while abundance and distribution declined during the Pliocene, megalodon <b>did</b> <b>show</b> a capacity to inhabit anti-tropical latitudes. It was found in locations with a mean temperature ranging from , with a total range of , indicating that the global extent of suitable habitat should not have been greatly affected by the temperature changes that occurred.|$|E
5|$|Darling had {{a strong}} {{personality}} and an independent outlook. Those who knew him well thought him destined {{to be a leader}} in whatever he undertook. He shunned strong drink and tobacco and found it difficult to tolerate overindulgence in alcohol. Normally even-tempered, he <b>did</b> <b>show</b> displeasure at the heckling from the crowd at Lord's at his obstinate defensive effort {{in the face of an}} Australian batting collapse. He was a stickler for fair play, but his actions against the English batsman KS Ranjitsinhji would today be seen as gamesmanship. During the bowler's approach and after the bowler had looked at the field, the Australian fielders moved behind Ranjitsinhji's back. This worried the Indian prince when playing his leg glance and eventually saw him left out of the English team.|$|E

5|$|Germanicus {{was given}} the title of {{quaestor}} in AD 7, five years before the legal age of 25, and in that year was sent to assist Tiberius {{in the war against}} the Pannonians and Dalmatians. According to Cassius Dio, Augustus sent Germanicus to Illyricum because Tiberius' lack of activity made Augustus suspect that he was delaying to remain under arms as long as possible under the pretense of war. Germanicus brought an army of levied citizens and manumitted slaves that were bought from their masters to reinforce Tiberius in Siscia, his base of operations in Illyricum. In late autumn/early winter additional reinforcements arrived at Siscia from Moesia and the East: three legions from Moesia led by Aulus Caecina Severus and two from Anatolia led by Silvanus with Thracian cavalry and auxiliary troops. While this <b>did</b> <b>show</b> that Augustus took the threat seriously, Tiberius had some soldiers sent back, because he had more than he needed.|$|E
5|$|The first {{investigation}} of the chapel ruins, supported by the National Trust, was conducted by the local history group {{in the winter of}} 1998–99. This survey was conducted under a licence from English Heritage that allowed access but did not permit excavation, so it relied on height measurements, geophysics (resistivity, and magnetometry) and molehill sampling. The area surveyed was 100m long and 40m wide (109yd by 44yd). The magnetometry failed to detect the subterranean features of the chapel, but <b>did</b> <b>show</b> an unexpected linear anomaly, related to buried ironwork from wartime defences. The resistivity survey clearly showed the larger room, but barely detected the smaller, suggesting that it had less substantial foundations, was probably less well-constructed, and possibly later in date.|$|E
5|$|Sotomayor's {{circuit court}} rulings {{led to her}} being {{considered}} a political centrist by the ABA Journal and other sources and organizations. Several lawyers, legal experts, and news organizations identified her as someone with liberal inclinations. In any case, the Second Circuit's caseload typically skewed more toward business and securities law rather than hot-button social or constitutional issues. Sotomayor tended to write narrow, practiced rulings that relied on close application of the law to the facts of a case rather than import general philosophical viewpoints. A Congressional Research Service analysis found that Sotomayor's rulings defied easy ideological categorization, but <b>did</b> <b>show</b> an adherence to precedent and an avoidance of overstepping the circuit court's judicial role. Unusually, Sotomayor read through all the supporting documents of cases under review; her lengthy rulings explored every aspect of a case and tended to feature leaden, ungainly prose. Some legal experts have said that Sotomayor's attention to detail and re-examination of the facts of a case came close to overstepping the traditional role of appellate judges.|$|E
