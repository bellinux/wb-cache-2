5|$|A {{request by}} the state to dismiss the suit was denied in August 1966, and the case was {{eventually}} <b>heard</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> state Court of Appeals, the highest court in the state.

On July7, 1967, the court ruled 6â€“1 in favor of the Sleepy Hollow Valley Committee. As a result, the western half of the new road was moved an additional mile to the north, bypassing North Tarrytown completely. The new alignment of NY117 was completed in November1970 and its former alignment along Bedford Road was redesignated as NY448.|$|E

5|$|The {{location}} {{brings in}} the need to rely upon native flora and fauna to survive. This is manifested in a stamina gauge, which constantly depletes during gameplay.
