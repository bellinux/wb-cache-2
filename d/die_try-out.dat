In order to obtain proper restraining force during <b>die</b> <b>try-out,</b> it is often necessary to adjust the drawbead through a very complicated procedure. It is thus meaningful to study the relationship between the parameters used to reflect metal forming effects and the geometric parameters of drawbead and then create a prediction model for them. This paper employs the radial basis function neural network technology to predict the geometric parameters of drawbead used in forming processes, where the genetic algorithm is used to optimize the neural network structure. Simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms the curve fitting method...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} elastic {{behaviour}} {{of the mechanical}} double action press and draw die system commonly used to draw sheet metal components in the automotive industry. High process variability in production and excessive time spent in <b>die</b> <b>try-out</b> are significant problems in automotive stamping. It has previously been suggested that the elastic behaviour of the system may contribute to these problems. However, the mechanical principles that cause the press system to affect the forming process have not been documented in detail. Due to a poor understanding of these problems in industry, the elasticity {{of the press and}} tools is currently not considered during the die design. The aim of this work was to explore the physical principles of press system elasticity and {{determine the extent to which}} it contributes to problems in try-out and production. On the basis of this analysis methods were developed for controlling or accounting for problems during the design process. The application of frictional restraining force to the edges of the blank during forming depends on the distribution and magnitude of the clamping force between the binders surfaces of the draw die. This is an important control parameter for the deep drawing process. It has been demonstrated in this work that the elasticity of the press and draw die can affect clamping force in two ways. The response of the press system, to the forces produced in the press during forming, causes the magnitude of clamping force to change during the stroke. This was demonstrated using measured data from a production press. A simple linear elastic model of the press system was developed to illustrate a definite link between the measured force variation and the elasticity of the press and tools. The simple model was extended into a finite element model of the complete press system, which was used to control a forming simulation. It was demonstrated that stiffness variation within the system could influence the final strains in a drawn part. At the conclusion of this investigation a method is proposed for assessing the sensitivity of a part to clamping force variation in the press during die design. A means of reducing variation in the press through the addition of a simple linear spring element is also discussed. The second part of the work assessed the influence of tool structure on the distribution of frictional restraining forces to the blank. A forming simulation showed that tool stiffness affects the distribution of clamping pressure between the binders. This was also shown to affect the final strains in a drawn part. However, the most significant influence on restraining force was the tendency of the blank to increase in thickness between the binders during forming. Using a finite element approximation of the try-out process it was shown that the structure of the tool would also contribute to the problems currently experienced in try-out where uneven contact pressure distributions are addressed by manually adjusting the tool surfaces. Finally a generalised approach to designing draw die structures was developed. Simple analysis methods were combined with finite element based topology optimisation techniques to develop a set of basic design guidelines. The aim of the guidelines was to produce a structure with uniform stiffness response to a pressure applied at the binder surface. The work concludes with a recommendation for introducing the methods developed in this thesis into the standard production process...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} achieve better part quality in sheet metal forming {{the rate of the}} {{material}} flow into the die cavity must be efficiently controlled. This control is obtained using a restraining force supplied either by the blankholder tool, drawbeads or both. When the restraining force required is too high, the use of drawbeads is necessary, although excessive blank deformation may be produced. Some other disadvantages such as adjustment difficulties during <b>die</b> <b>try-outs</b> to determine the actual Drawbead Restraining Force (DBRF) may also be encountered. One way to solve these problems and {{to reduce the number of}} <b>die</b> <b>try-outs</b> - which are very much time consuming - is to introduce/define accurate enough drawbead concepts. The present study will make use of a method that has been developed using the similitude approach in order to understand the influence of the most important parameters on DBRF and to establish a pre-estimate DBRF theory. Data bases have been developed throughout Explicit Dynamic Finite Element Method (EDFEM) based simulations. The results are compared with experimental data bases provided by Nine (1978) and with the analytical model of Stoughton (1988) results. The average of absolute error with respect to experimental data bases was around 6 % and, for the studied cases, the maximum discrepancy was found to be below 11 %. For the analytical and experimental cases, the average of absolute error was approximately 5 % and, for the studied cases, the maximum error was below 7 %. In terms of precision, the predictions derived from this approach are adequate when compared with analytical and experimental results. For this reason, the approach has been validated and accepted as a contribution to STAMPACK®, a commercial explicit dynamic finite element based system for forming processes numerical simulation...|$|R
