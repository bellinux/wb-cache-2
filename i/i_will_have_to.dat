When Giles asked what the title meant, Murdoch informed him that [...] "It's Latin, Frank; the e means you're out and the meritus means you deserved it." [...] Murdoch later said that [...] "circulation went up and it stayed up. We didn't lose money or anything like that", referring to the 20,000 new readers the paper retained after the scandal broke, {{and the fact that}} Stern returned all the money paid to it by the Sunday Times. In April 2012, during the Leveson Inquiry, he acknowledged his role in publishing the diaries, and took the blame for making the decision, saying [...] "It was a massive mistake I made and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> live with {{it for the rest of}} my life." [...] Trevor-Roper died in 2003. Despite a long and respected career as a historian, according to Richard Davenport-Hines, his biographer, Trevor-Roper's role in the scandal left his reputation [...] "permanently besmirched". In January 1984 Broyles resigned as editor of Newsweek, to [...] "pursue new entrepreneurial ventures".|$|E

"I can {{see that}} if I {{want to get back}} in the Test side <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{concentrate}} on opening because there seems to be plenty of middle-order batsmen", he said. However, when picked to play against the West Indies for a Tasmanian Invitational XI he made 1; then when he asked to bat down the order he was dismissed for 15. Against NSW he made 42 and 10 then impressed against England with 45 and 75 not out and 50 against WA.|$|E
2500|$|There {{is not a}} {{day that}} goes by that I do not feel remorse for what {{happened}} that day in My Lai", he told members of the club. [...] "I feel remorse for the Vietnamese who were killed, for their families, for the American soldiers involved and their families. I am very sorry....If you are asking why I did not stand up to them when I was given the orders, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say that I was a 2nd lieutenant getting orders from my commander and I followed them—foolishly, I guess.|$|E

2500|$|During the Parliamentary {{debates that}} led to the {{introduction}} of the NMP scheme, it was argued by a number of PAP MPs such as Dr. Arthur Beng, Dr. Tan Cheng Bock, Dr. Dixie Tan, and Dr. Aline Wong that the scheme is undemocratic in nature given the fact that NMPs are nominated rather than elected by the people for the people. However, in accordance with party discipline, they were eventually required to vote in favour of the constitutional amendment. As Beng said: [...] "This is the constraint upon us, and I guess <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> continue to live a schizophrenic political life – speaking against, yet voting for a Bill." ...|$|E

I know that in order to play football again <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be accepted back by the players and staff of the West Coast Eagles and the AFL and I'm willing to fulfil any obligations imposed on me.

2500|$|In {{the morning}} {{following}} his resignation, {{he woke up}} much earlier than usual {{and sat on the}} balcony meditating. His wife tried to console him for losing his premiership position. He famously replied: [...] "I’m not worried about the premiership, but I’m worried about how to announce to you that <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> cancel our telephone subscription for lack of money in my possession given the fact that my law firm has been closed for eight months and I am without clients." [...] He is famous for having once said to a man who asked him to join a prolific business project [...] "I would never even dare give the chance to the smallest villager in the most remote town to even think that I made a benefit of one penny".|$|E

2500|$|From the {{beginning}} of the project, Capra had insisted that the films would explore the relationship of science and religion. In his autobiography, Capra paraphrased his early comments to a meeting of the scientific advisory board assembled by AT and N. W. Ayer, [...] "If I make a science film, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> say that science research is just another expression of the Holy Spirit that works in all men. Furthermore, I will say that science, in essence, is just another facet of man's quest for God." [...] At a later stage in the project, Capra wrote that the films would have [...] "the obligation to stress {{or at the very least}} to acknowledge the spiritual side of man's make-up — to acknowledge that all good things come from God — including science." ...|$|E
2500|$|Having {{signed the}} {{pre-contract}} with Real Madrid, McManaman still had five months {{left on his}} contract at Liverpool. New manager Gérard Houllier, who had replaced Evans as full coach following the failure of their joint-managerial role, was widely believed to {{want to get rid}} of the [...] "Spice Boys" [...] mentality and cavalier attitudes at the club having told many players they were surplus to requirements (including Jason McAteer, Phil Babb, Rob Jones, Stig Bjornebye and Paul Ince). While stating that he would have preferred that the player stayed, he said that the club had to respect McManaman's decision to exercise his right to leave at the end of his contract. Houllier said, [...] "It wasn't unexpected. Steve had always maintained that he wanted to move abroad and I have to respect that... Emotionally we will miss him because he's a Liverpool lad, and needless to say as a player you can't fault him because he has immense ability... <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> replace him, it's my job to go out and find another Steve McManaman." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{shut-down}} of the Army facility {{proved the}} last straw for Truman. [...] On the evening of July 23, Truman ordered the steelmakers and the union {{to meet in the}} White House the following day and settle the strike. At 10:00a.m. on July 24, Murray and Fairless were ushered into the Oval Office. Truman informed the two men of top-secret statistics which showed the U.S. war effort in Korea was being crippled. The President then told Fairless: [...] "You can settle this thing, Ben, and you've got to settle it. I want it settled by tomorrow morning, or I will have some things to say that you won't like to hear, and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do some things you won't like." [...] Fairless started in surprise. Truman then turned to Murray and said, [...] "Phil, you've got to settle this thing too. Now go in there in the Cabinet room, and I want you to come out with a settlement." [...] The two men adjourned to the Cabinet Room. At 4:45p.m., Fairless and Murray told the President that they had reached an agreement. Steelman witnessed its signing.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the meeting}} {{when one of}} the Princes {{nominated}} Wichaichan as the next Front Palace, many in the council objected. The most notable objection of this nomination came from Prince Vorachak Tharanubhab. The Prince argued that the appointment of such an important position was the sole prerogative of the King and not of the council. Furthermore, the position was not hereditary and the appointment of the son of the former could set a dangerous precedent. [...] The nomination [...] of Wichaichan however was supported by Si Suriyawongse who wanted to secure a line of succession by appointing an able and experienced Front Palace (as the second-in-line to the throne). Si Suriyawongse was determined, he retorted by accusing the Prince of wanting to be appointed himself ("ที่ไม่ยอมนั้น อยากจะเป็นเองหรือ"). The Prince replied wearily [...] "If you have ask me to permit it , then <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> permit it" [...] ("ถ้าจะให้ยอมก็ต้องยอม"). As a result, Prince Wichaichan was appointed Front Palace (Krom Phra Rajawang Bovorn Sathan Mongkol) and Vice King without the full consent of the incoming Monarch. The relationship between Chulalongkorn and the Wichaichan would remain difficult {{for the rest of the}} latter's life, based on this fact. On 11 November 1868 Wichaichan's cousin Chulalongkorn was crowned Supreme King of Siam at the Grand Palace.|$|E
2500|$|Perhaps Hall's {{greatest}} {{performance of}} the English summer was in the second Test at Lord's. On {{the final day of}} the Test, Hall bowled unchanged for 200 minutes, broken only by the tea interval. As in the Tied Test in Brisbane three years earlier, Hall found himself bowling the final over of the match with both sides still capable of winning. In the innings as a whole Hall bowled 40 overs for a return of 4/93 but despite Hall's brave efforts, England managed to hold on for a draw—the England batsman Colin Cowdrey returned to the crease with a broken arm to help save the match. The Times said of Hall that day, [...] "His energy was astonishing, his stamina inexhaustible, his speed awesome, from the first ball to the last". Hall himself claimed that it was his [...] "finest hour". There was a sour note in the final Test at The Oval when Hall was informally warned about intimidatory bowling. Hall bowled two successive bouncers to the England opening batsman Brian Bolus, prompting umpire Syd Buller to speak with West Indies captain Worrell saying, [...] "We don't want this sort of bowling to get out of hand otherwise <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> speak to the bowler." [...] Later than innings, Griffith was formally warned by the same umpire.|$|E
2500|$|... "You {{have heard}} the order, and I must confess are in a pretty {{condition}} to obey it. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> return it with the endorsement upon the back that 'the First Maryland refuses to meet the enemy', despite being given orders by General Jackson. Before this day I was proud to call myself a Marylander, but now, God knows, I would rather be known as anything else. Shame on you to bring this stigma upon the fair name of your native state - to cause the finger of scorn to be pointed at those who confided to your keeping their most sacred trust - their honor {{and that of the}} glorious Old State. Marylanders you call yourselves - profane not that hallowed name again, for it is not yours. What Marylander ever before threw down his arms and deserted his colors {{in the presence of the}} enemy, and those arms, and those colors too, placed in your hands by a woman? Never before has one single blot defaced her honored history. Could it be possible to conceive a crime more atrocious, an outrage more damnable? Go home and publish to the world your infamy. Boast of it when you meet your fathers and mothers, brothers, sisters and sweethearts. Tell them it was you who, when brought face to face with the enemy, proved yourselves recreants, and acknowledged yourselves to be cowards. Tell them this, and see if you are not spurned from their presence like some loathsome leper, and despised, detested, nay abhorred, by those whose confidence you have so shamefully betrayed; you will wander over the face of the earth with the brand of 'coward', 'traitor', indelibly imprinted on your foreheards, and in the end sink into a dishonored grave, unwept for, uncared for, leaving behind as a heritage to your posterity the scorn and contempt of every honest man and virtuous woman in the land." ...|$|E
