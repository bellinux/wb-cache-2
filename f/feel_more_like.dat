Once they arrive, they see that only mothers and their children are there; they decide to hit the lobby bar instead. They discuss how they do not feel grown up and how being an adult is not necessarily a good thing.|$|E
5|$|Although modern fantasy {{may often}} embrace strangeness, the Ice and Fire series is {{generally}} praised {{for what is}} perceived as a sort of medieval realism. Believing that magic should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre, Martin set out to make the story <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters. Though the amount of magic has gradually increased throughout the story, the series is still to end with less overt magic than most contemporary fantasies. In Martin's eyes, literary effective magic needs to represent strange and dangerous forces beyond human comprehension, not advanced alien technologies or formulaic spells. As such, the characters understand only the natural aspects of their world, but not the magical elements like the Others.|$|E
5|$|While visiting Nintendo {{for other}} work, celebrity {{copywriter}} Shigesato Itoi pitched to the company's lead designer Shigeru Miyamoto, his {{idea for a}} role-playing game set in contemporary times. The modern setting worked against role-playing genre norms, and while Miyamoto liked the idea, he was hesitant until Itoi could show full commitment to the project. Itoi reduced his workload, formed a team, and began development in Ichikawa, Chiba. Nintendo tried to accommodate Itoi's ideal work environment to <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> an extracurricular club of volunteers. Itoi wrote the game's script. Mother was developed by Ape, published by Nintendo, and released in Japan on July 27, 1989 for the Famicom (known as the Nintendo Entertainment System outside Japan). The game was slated for an English-language localization as Earth Bound, but was abandoned when the team chose to localize Mother 2 instead. Years later, the complete localization was recovered by the public and distributed on the Internet, where it became known as EarthBound Zero. Mother received its English language debut in June 2015 as EarthBound Beginnings for the Wii U Virtual Console.|$|E

25|$|Carpenter's script makes many {{allusions to}} film history and inspirations for this film. There are many {{references}} to the films of Howard Hawks.

There are also subtle references to directors Sergio Leone and Alfred Hitchcock. The day and time titles were used to make the film <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a documentary.|$|E
25|$|The {{gameplay}} in Angel Beats! follows {{an interactive}} branching plot line with multiple scenarios. Originally {{meant to be}} a role-playing game, Maeda eventually conceded to making it into a visual novel adventure game. When designing the game, Maeda did not want to include choices for the player that would not have a meaningful effect, so the choices given were focused to {{have an effect on the}} plot and character interactions. A reviewer noted that its game structure makes it <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a game compared to other adventure games released around the same time, which have less choices available to the player and less-divergent plot lines. 1st Beat ranked as the best-selling PC game sold in Japan for the time of its release, and charted in the national top 50 twice more after that.|$|E

25|$|In {{a review}} on Famitsu.com by Taiga Asaba, Angel Beats! 1st Beat is {{described}} as not merely complementing the anime it is based on, but instead using the characters and setting to produce a wholly new story, which creates a separate charm surrounding the separate versions of the story. Asaba notes that the theme revolving around family already present in the anime is expanded upon in the game {{for each of the}} characters. Regarding the game's mechanics, Asaba found it fairly difficult to go down specific character routes, noting that a small change in how to diverge the plot line results in large changes to the characters. Asaba writes that its game structure makes it <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a game compared to other adventure games released around the same time, which have less choices available to the player and less-divergent plot lines.|$|E

According to reviewer Scott Hreha, there was [...] "something about the remastering that makes it <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> an official album—the earlier CD version’s weak fidelity unfairly emphasized the 'basement' nature of the recordings, where it now possesses a clarity that belies its humble and informal origins." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode is}} notable for being written by William Gibson, {{together}} with fellow science fiction novelist and long-time friend Tom Maddox. [...] "First Person Shooter" [...] {{was the second}} episode written by the authors, after {{the success of the}} fifth season episode [...] "Kill Switch", which first aired on February 15, 1998 and subsequently made frequent appearances in reruns, encouraging Gibson to continue working in television. According to executive producer Frank Spotnitz, the writing process for [...] "First Person Shooter" [...] was slow. Initially, Gibson and Maddox presented the first two acts of their idea, which was tweaked by series creator Chris Carter and Spotnitz {{in order to make it}} <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> an X-File. After the rewriting process, the writers then returned with the subsequent acts. Gibson and Maddox were fans of The Lone Gunmen and purposely wrote them into the episode.|$|E

However, the American national team invited him to join their squad. Hull accepted and led the team in scoring with 7 goals and 11 points for the sixth place Americans. Hull later said the faith shown in him by American officials gave him the confidence to excel in his career. He played with Team USA {{for the rest of}} his career, and at the 1986 Calgary Cup tournament, played a pivotal role in a 5–3 upset of Canada by the Americans.

500|$|Jeremy Parish of USgamer {{described}} {{the game as}} a mild-mannered parody ("between satire and pastiche") of the role-playing game genre, specifically the Dragon Quest series. He noted that Mother, like many Japanese role-playing games, emulated the Dragon Quest style: the windowed interface, first-person perspective in combat, and graphics, but differed in its contemporary setting and non-fantasy story. Parish commented that Atlus's 1987 [...] was similarly set in the modern day, though it devolved into science fiction and fantasy in ways Mother did not. He added that the game has [...] "a sense of wonder and magic realism ... {{in the context of}} childhood imagination" [...] as Ninten can <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> someone [...] "pretending" [...] to be a Dragon Quest-style hero than a hero in his own right. Parish said this makes the player wonder which game events are real and which are Ninten's imagination. Parish cited Itoi's interest in entering the games industry to make a [...] "satirical" [...] role-playing game as proof of the genre's swift five-year rise to widespread popularity in Japan.|$|E
500|$|Kruger {{was going}} deaf and losing {{some of his}} {{sharpness}} but his presence in Europe nevertheless had enormous propaganda value for the Boers.

Accompanied by Leyds, {{he went on to}} an exuberant reception in Paris, then continued to Cologne on 1 December. Here the public greeted him with similar excitement, but Kaiser Wilhelm II refused to receive him in Berlin. Having apparently still harboured hopes of German assistance in the war, Kruger was deeply shocked. [...] "The Kaiser has betrayed us", he told Leyds. They went on to the Netherlands, which was strictly neutral and could not assist militarily, but would <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> home. After another buoyant reception from the general public Kruger was cordially received by Wilhelmina and her family in The Hague, but it soon became clear to Leyds that it embarrassed the Dutch government to have them staying in the capital. The Kruger party moved to Hilversum in April 1901.|$|E

500|$|Lowell {{returned}} to the United States and began his duties at Harvard {{in the summer of}} 1856. Still grieving the loss of his wife, however, he avoided Elmwood, lodging instead in an area known as Professors' Row on Kirkland Street in Cambridge along with his daughter Mabel and her governess Frances Dunlap. Lowell and Dunlap married in 1857. After the death of Lowell's father in January 1861 due to a heart attack, he moved back to Elmwood with his family. Despite avoiding the home for so long, he was pleased to be back. He wrote to his friend Charles Frederick Briggs: [...] "I am back again to the place I love best. I am sitting in my old garret, at my old desk, smoking my old pipe... I begin to <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> my old self than I have these ten years". However, Elmwood's expenses drained him, with taxes at $1,000 a year. As early as 1867, he considered renting out Elmwood and moving into a smaller home elsewhere but never did. Instead, to ease his financial plight, he began to sell off land in 1870 until only two and a half acres remained.|$|E
500|$|He {{explained}} [...] "the {{goal is to}} try to make it {{an engaging}} movie where you get some of the psychology and kind of bring a freshness but also keep the classic nature of Alice." [...] On prior versions, Burton said [...] "It was always a girl wandering around from one crazy character to another, and I never really felt any real emotional connection." [...] His goal with the new film is to give the story [...] "some framework of emotional grounding" [...] and [...] "to try and make Alice <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> a story as opposed to a series of events." [...] Burton focused on the poem [...] "Jabberwocky" [...] as part of his structure, and refers to the described creature by the name of the poem rather than by the name [...] "Jabberwock" [...] used in the poem. Burton also stated that he does not see his version as either a sequel to any existing Alice film nor as a [...] "re-imagining". However, the idea of the climax of the story being Alice's battle with the Queen's champion, the Jabberwocky, was first added in the video game American McGee's Alice, and the landscape, tower, weapons and appearance of Alice in those scenes of the film are very reminiscent of the same scenes in the game.|$|E
500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1857, The Atlantic Monthly was established, and Lowell was its first editor. With its first issue in November of that year, he at once gave the {{magazine}} the stamp of high literature and of bold speech on public affairs. In January 1861, Lowell's father {{died of a heart}} attack, inspiring Lowell to move his family back to Elmwood. As he wrote to his friend Briggs, [...] "I am back again to the place I love best. I am sitting in my old garret, at my old desk, smoking my old pipe... I begin to <b>feel</b> <b>more</b> <b>like</b> my old self than I have these ten years." [...] Shortly thereafter, in May, he left The Atlantic Monthly when James Thomas Fields took over as editor; the magazine had been purchased by Ticknor and Fields for $10,000 two years before. Lowell returned to Elmwood by January 1861 but maintained an amicable relationship with the new owners of the journal, continuing to submit his poetry and prose {{for the rest of his}} life. His prose, however, was more abundantly presented in the pages of the North American Review during the years 1862–1872. For the Review, he served as a coeditor along with Charles Eliot Norton. Lowell's reviews for the journal covered a wide variety of literary releases of the day, though he was writing fewer poems.|$|E
