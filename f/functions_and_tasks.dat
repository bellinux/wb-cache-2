40|$|As a {{treatment}} methodology, teletherapy selectively destroys cancerous and other tissue {{by exposure to}} an external beam of ionizing radiation. Sources of radiation are either a radioactive isotope, typically Cobalt- 60 (Co- 60), or a linear accelerator. Records maintained by the NRC have identified instances of teletherapy misadministration where the delivered radiation dose has differed from the radiation prescription (e. g., instances where fractions were delivered to the wrong patient, to the wrong body part, or were too great or too little {{with respect to the}} defined treatment volume). Both human error and machine malfunction have led to misadministrations. Effective and safe treatment requires a concern for precision and consistency of human-human and human-machine interactions throughout the course of therapy. The present study is the first part of a series of human factors evaluations for identifying the root causes that lead to human error in the teletherapy environment. The human factors evaluations included: (1) a <b>function</b> <b>and</b> <b>task</b> analysis of teletherapy activities, (2) an evaluation of the human-system interfaces, (3) an evaluation of procedures used by teletherapy staff, (4) an evaluation of the training and qualifications of treatment staff (excluding the oncologists), (5) an evaluation of organizational practices and policies, and (6) an identification of problems and alternative approaches for NRC and industry attention.

40|$|A {{series of}} human factors {{evaluations}} was undertaken {{to better understand}} the contributing factors to human error in the teletherapy environment. Teletherapy is a multidisciplinary methodology for treating cancerous tissue through selective exposure to an external beam of ionizing radiation. The principal sources of radiation are a radioactive isotope, typically cobalt 60 (Co- 60), or a linear accelerator device capable of producing very high energy x-ray and electron beams. A team of human factors specialists conducted site visits to radiation oncology departments at community hospitals, university centers, and free-standing clinics. In addition, a panel of radiation oncologists, medical physicists, and radiation technologists served as subject matter experts. A <b>function</b> <b>and</b> <b>task</b> analysis was initially performed to guide subsequent evaluations in the areas of user-system interfaces, procedures, training and qualifications, and organizational policies and practices. The present report focuses on an evaluation of the human-system interfaces in relation to the treatment machines and supporting equipment (e. g., simulators, treatment planning computers, control consoles, patient charts) found in the teletherapy environment.

Participants were 523 students (273 boys) from 32 classrooms across Estonia.

Driven by technology and user expectations, the word "Reserves" no longer simply means providing supplementary hardcopy materials and scanned readings for a course. While some units {{across the country are}} expanding to include various emerging technologies and methods of delivery, such as streaming video, others are scaling back or discontinuing their services altogether. Questions about copyright compliance and licensing restrictions, the relationship of e-reserves to course management systems, and how to manage drastically decreased budgets and staffing are leading many institutions towards a new appraisal of what e-reserves is, and should be in the future. In this session, two regional campus librarians will discuss broad issues surrounding electronic reserves and provide some examples of how units are dealing with document requests, delivery, storage and management in this changing environment. We will also discuss innovative pilot projects underway and approaches currently in practice at the University of Washington. Audience members will leave this session with a broader understanding and perspective on the major changes occurring in e-reserves, along with practical ideas for managing their own operations.
