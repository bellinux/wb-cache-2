We inquire into this contrasting picture {{between theory and practice}} through an in-depth case study that suggests that what begins as customer dependence transforms into vulnerability to employees. While perceived vulnerability to customers is efficiently removed through ex ante controls, the physical asset specificity in each customer order generates task uncertainty, specialization and teamwork, which become the new sources of opportunism threat for the customization providers.

Universal pensions available to everyone of eligible age, regardless of income, assets or employment history, have many advantages over targeted pensions.

For reasons that are unclear, governments almost always prefer ex ante tests to <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>controls</b> for noncontributory pensions, even though the reverse is true for tax collection.

40|$|Quite {{apart from}} the {{question}} of the justifiability – based on prior normative commitments – of legal rules controlling the substance of contractual exchange, such as a fair price rule, a common complaint against such rules is based on the difficulties of implementing and enforcing them. Rather than proceeding from first principles, it is also possible to examine the consequences of ex ante and <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>controls</b> on the fairness of contractual exchange in contexts where they have been imposed before testing such consequences against any normative commitments. Such an approach allows both to examine whether practical constraints on enforcing rules over the fairness of exchange are truly binding and, even if they are, whether such rules can have other either beneficial or negative effects on parties and on contract law more broadly. We present a case study of credit markets in a rural community in early modern France marked by the relative absence of the State as a regulatory agent.

But the rule of law benefits of the "new" nondelegation doctrine are no greater than those delivered by the current means of <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>controls.</b> The rule of law serves three primary functions: it reduces uncertainty; it minimizes the likelihood of government tyranny; and it helps to assure political accountability. Judicially enforced ex ante constraints, however, are not necessary to perform any of these functions, and may even undermine some of them. In addition, the rule of law is not the be-all and end-all of regulatory systems. There are countervailing benefits to a system that allows for regulatory flexibility. Although there may be some role for ex ante constraints in controlling agency discretion, the factors that determine the means of limiting agency discretion are political rather than legal in nature.

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} {{economic}} and environmental effects to hog finishing farms from residual taxes/standards and restrictions on manure application and stocking density. Economic effects are {{measured in terms of}} net farm income and land prices, while levels of ammonia and excess nitrogen and phosphorus proxy the environmental effects. Any environmental policy requiring the need for additional land comes at a small cost to farmers who have access to adequate neighboring land. If this is not the case, then manure application and stocking density restrictions are expensive since the producer is basically forced to either purchase land or reduce hog production levels. Key Words: land value, manure application restrictions, stocking density Public concerns over the environmental consequen-ces of livestock production and the concentration of that production in larger farm units has led to more numerous, and increasingly more stringent, regu-lations on farm practices. These regulations have evolved from simple ex ante restrictions, such as minimum separation distances of new barns from waterways, to <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>controls</b> or incentives on man-agement practices. Although there is a geographical disparity in the extent of the legislation among countries and jurisdictions (Beghin and Metcalfe, 2000), nutrient management standards and/or stock-ing density restrictions are becoming part of the regulatory constraints facing livestock farmers.

40|$|On battlefields {{and within}} organizations, a fog obscures {{subordinate}} activity from superior observation, producing an information asymmetry endemic to most superior-subordinate relationships. A superior’s ability to observe, to peer through this fog, distinguishes {{different types of}} organizations, largely determining what tasks an organization may accomplish and how superior control is balanced against subordinate autonomy (James Wilson, 2000). Yet modern technology is lifting this fog, with each day increasing the detail and depth of what superiors may observe. This thesis explores superior control with modern technology, by introducing and assessing a new term, nanomanagement—where superiors use technology to control, in ever-increasing detail, the actions of all of their subordinates. Through interviewing mid-level officers of the U. S. and British armies, who served in Iraq between 2003 and 2008, this qualitative study explores two questions. “Why nanomanagement?” seeks to understand the causes, or what may motivate nanomanagement. “How does nanomanagement influence superior control and subordinate autonomy?” seeks to understand the effects of nanomanagement. This thesis employs five factors—organizational culture, ex ante controls, <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>controls,</b> hierarchical control and exogenous factors—as different theoretical frameworks to understand nanomanagement. Trackers, drones and long screwdrivers, modern variants of police patrols that reduce transaction costs and may reverse information asymmetry, are introduced. This thesis also suggests three terms to describe when nanomanaging superiors take action undermining traditional hierarchical control: shifting (focusing attention on subordinate levels), drifting (acting at subordinate levels), and grifting (cheating the hierarchy by controlling actions at levels beneath their immediate subordinates). These actions signal {{a new form of}} hierarchical control by exclusion—ex claudere control. By analyzing a case where much of the fog separating superior from subordinate thinned and lifted, this thesis assesses and updates the long fought battle between superior control and subordinate autonomy.

40|$|In this Article, I study a {{fascinating}} problem - {{what are the}} legal, political and economic implications of regulating executive bonuses? While the Administration 2 ̆ 7 s recent consideration of proposals to tax bonuses of AIG executives has sparked {{a great deal of}} media speculation and attention, there has been little legal scholarship discussing the various possible consequences of this and other methods of regulating executive compensation. Especially given the growing interest in executive compensation and the possible benefits and costs of regulation in this arena, I believe this paper will make a significant scholarly contribution to the existing literature on corporate governance and tax policy with respect to executive compensation. While the media has focused on public outrage and resulting political pressures to punish executives that took excessive risk while compensating themselves handsomely, the little legal literature on the subject has focused almost exclusively on constitutional and contractual dimensions. Economists and scholars of human capital, however, also raise issues around potential disincentive effects of such measures (for instance, would excessive controls on compensation dissuade talent from seeking such jobs?). In addition, there is an ongoing debate on {{whether or not there is}} even a relationship between executive incentive mechanisms and firm performance - while some scholars argue that performance-contingent compensation does indeed improve firm-level financial outcomes others argue just the opposite. In general, the literature on incentive effects and the pay for performance relationship has the potential to inform the current debate on taxing executive bonuses. In sum, to the best of my knowledge, there has been no attempt to integrate or synthesize the different factors - legal, political, and economic- that impact the potential costs and benefits of taxing or otherwise regulating executive bonuses and other forms of incentive compensation retroactively. I conduct a systematic review of the legal studies literature and the literature on incentive effects of executive bonuses, and consolidate them into a concise, simple framework that distinguishes ex ante controls on compensation with <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>controls,</b> and contrasts process-oriented policy options with content-oriented ones. As I offer a concise and comprehensive account of the various factors that affect the costs and benefits of regulating executive compensation and identify unanswered issues, legal and other, I conclude that no single policy is going to act as a “silver bullet. ” My critical review of each of these policy choices reveals that the problems associated with executive compensation are endemic to the flawed U. S. corporate governance structure, and thus cannot be mitigated without fundamental structural reform in that broader system...|$|E

40|$|Explaining {{the form}} of public sector {{organizations}} is a major contribution that organizational theory has to offer {{to the study of}} the public sector. In this chapter, we investigate the characteristics of the relationships between agencies and their parent administration in the Italian central government. The study, rooted in organizational theory, adopts different theoretical angles, at first a ‘cultural-normative’ approach mainly embedded in a logic of appropriateness perspective (March and Olsen, 1989, 1994, 1996), then an approach focused on instrumental rationality mainly embedded in a logic of consequences perspective (for an overview of different streams in organization theory for the study of the public sector, see Christensen et al., 2007). Governments in many countries have established semi-autonomous single-purpose organizations (OECD, 2002), to which we refer as public agencies, and Italy has been no exception in this respect (Ongaro, 2006 and 2008). How to wield the control function towards agencies has become a prominent area of research in public management studies. Many studies address the topic of control as a ‘systemic’ issue, as the notion of control has been related to the way the relationships among various actors are coordinated in order to achieve a common (public) goal (Kaufmann, 1986). Other studies deal with the concept of control as an inter-organizational coordination tool (Klijn, 2005; Narad, 2006; Verhoest et al., 2007). Other authors have explored the control topic as an accountability-related theme (Bovens et al., 2008; Gregory, 2003; Mulgan, 2000) or even more generally as a central issue in public administration and public management reform (Kettl, 2000; Romzek, 2000). As a starting point, we may assume that there are two broad modalities whereby control of agencies is exercised: ex ante controls and <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>controls.</b> Ex ante controls (Thompson, 1993; Verhoest et al., 2004; Wirth, 1986) refer to a broad set of mechanisms ranging from the appointment of the director general/CEO and the members of the board to the definition of rules and standards by the parent organization to which the agency has to comply (constraining the behaviour in order to steer the agency towards the outputs desired by the parent administration). This perspective refers both to the formal-bureaucratic aspects of the ministry-agency relationship (Egeberg, 2003) and to other forms of control that can be read (also) through the lens of the theory of clans (Ouchi, 1980) – whereby control is pursued through the selection and appointments of top executives having clannish relations (in the sense clarified by Ouchi) with the ‘political master’ in the parent administration. The second perspective is based on the assumption that the ‘parent’ administration can steer and control ‘its’ agency by setting the goals it is expected to pursue and controlling ex post their achievement. This second perspective largely refers to the management control and performance management literature (Bouckaert and Halligan, 2008; Bouckaert and van Dooren, 2003; Laegried et al., 2006 a; Moynihan, 2006) and has important roots in the concept of ‘Management by Objectives and Results’: it is a performance management concept that ‘entails a redoubled attempt to operationalize goals for government and to use these goals more actively both in choosing between alternative actions and in evaluating results’ (Christensen et al., 2007, p. 89). Ex post control, or result-based control, concerns the assignment of goals to the agency and the assessment by the parent administration of the degree of achievement of the goals by the agency, as well as the possible execution of sanctions or attribution of rewards associated to the achievement of goals. The complex nature of the relationships between the parent administration and the agency based on a performance management logic has recently been studied with reference to the autonomy-control balance (Verschuere, 2007; see also Barbieri and Ongaro, 2008) or as an indicator of ‘NPMness’ of such relationships (Verhoest et al., 2004; Verschuere and Barbieri, 2009). This chapter addresses the question of what are the determinants of result-based forms of control. The analysis is focused on the ex post result control for three main reasons: the already extensive literature on ex ante control instruments on Italian agencies, which contrasts with the absence (to our knowledge) of any systematic investigation of the determinants of result-based controls; the chance to compare the findings on the impact of the selected independent variables (age, staff size, budget size, type of task and policy field) with investigations performed in other countries (see this book, and in the range of recent works on the topic the contributions by Laegreid et al., 2006 b; Verschuere, 2007); the opportunity to empirically investigate the degree of implementation of a major public management reform that occurred in Italy in 1999, that had the declared goal of introducing forms of result-based control in the Italian public sector. In the study of the determinants of result-based control, we have at first considered that the forms of control between the agency and the parent administration may be determined by institutionalisation processes that unfold over time under the influence of certain factors. We assume both ministries and agencies to be institutionalized organisations and we investigate their relationship on the basis of factors that may affect the organisational form of their relationship. Factors like age, size (in both budget and staff terms), the type of task executed, the policy field in which the agency and the ministry operate have been considered (on the ground of theoretical argumentations explained in the third section, in which the hypotheses about the influence of such factors on result-based control are formulated). A supplement of investigation was required, however, since the statistical analysis did not provide conclusive evidence about the influence such factors may have on {{the form of}} control. We then adopted a different perspective, and considered the reform processes that occurred in Italy over the last two decades (Ongaro, 2009). In the range of a number of reform programmes that were launched during that period in Italy, one can be singled out as regards the area of organisational form of central government agencies and the agency-ministry relationship; in fact, in 1999 a comprehensive reform of the central government prescribed, within the framework of a general re-organisation of the central government, the establishment of a number of new agencies patterned on a well-identified model, which can be easily recognized in the UK ‘Next Steps’ model of public agency. Though it is beyond the scope of this chapter to investigate the policy process that led to the enactment of this reform programme (to what extent it was a case of policy transfer from abroad, the way different policy alternatives were considered and how this one came to be selected, etc.), for the purposes of this work we may consider that a well-specified model of public agency, centred on result-based control, was intentionally introduced in the Italian central administration. From a hierarchically-oriented instrumental perspective on reform (Christensen et al., 2007, chapters 2 and 7), we may quite straightforwardly state that the executive government at the higher level forced the introduction of a new organisational form in the Italian central public administration. What have been the effects of this reform on <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>controls</b> in the relationship between agencies and their parent administration? And has this new organisational form, and particularly the type of result-based control which is a central component of it, institutionalised over time? As illustrated in closer detail later in this chapter, this reform has led to establishing a set of agencies that can be singled out of the overall population of the investigated central government agencies because of their high level of result-control. However, the reform has been apparently not ‘institutionalized’ and the broader population of Italian central government agencies (encompassing those agencies established subsequently to the 1999 reform) displays a level of result-based control markedly different from that of the agencies established by the 1999 reform...|$|E

The direct and indirect effects of control mechanisms are assessed in a comparative case study on plenary parliamentary debates in the Danish Folketing and Dutch Tweede Kamer on the EU multiannual budgets Delors II, Agenda 2000 and Financial Perspectives 2007 - 2013. It finds that control mechanisms have direct effects on the size of parliamentary debate and indirectly on the scope of conflict. As control mechanisms structure the timing of debates, different interactions with the policy-formulation process and media coverage are created leading to different scopes of conflict. It finds that ex ante mechanisms trigger smaller, more partisan debates at an early stage of the policy-formulation process, whereas <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> mechanisms stimulate larger, later and intergovern-mental debates.

Our comparative research is based on desk research and statistical analysis of the COBRA data. In contrast to Romania whose agency management has gravitated around the Weberian-style model, Lithuania has shifted its agency landscape more towards the NPM-style management as a result of more extensive and centralized managerial reforms in the 2000 s. This is attributable to a more systemic and top-down approach to result-oriented management in the latter country.

40|$|PROTECTION OF COMPETITION - BLOCK EXEMPTIONS The {{purpose of}} my thesis is to {{describe}} and analyze regulation of block exemptions mainly {{in the light of}} Commission's Guidelines. The function of block exemptions is to exempt certain agreements from the prohibition of distortion of competition. The thesis is composed of five chapters, each of them dealing with different aspects related to the concept of block exemptions. First chapter is an introduction into the topic of protection of competition and explains basic principles and terminology. Chapter two deals with other exemptions from prohibition of distorting competition. The chapter is divided into four subchapters. The first one analyzes four aspects of the exemption under Article 101 (3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The second subchapter focuses on de minimis rule. Third subchapter deals with exemption in agriculture sector. Finally, the problem of block exemptions is briefly introduced. Third chapter follows the historic development of the concept of block exemptions both in European law and Czech law. Firstly, it describes the reasons for introduction of block exemptions by the Commission and then it focuses on the change of approach in year 2004, when <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>control</b> was introduced.

Risks associated with products and services have also increased, as have mass problems and mass damages, often in a transborder dimension. The US and the European Community, though battling against common problems, maintain different standard setting and enforcement regimes. This paper focuses on enforcement regimes, thereby distinguishing between administrative enforcement via agencies and judicial collective enforcement via European collective actions and US class actions. The existing theoretical framework depicting administrative and judicial enforcement as alternative strategies is contrasted against modern developments in the US and the EC. In the field of consumer protection administrative control and judicial collective enforcement are being understood more as functional complements than alternatives. Enforcement covers negotiation, settlement, adjudication and arbitration. The analysis of the institutional variables determining the choice between administrative and judicial control – ex ante vs. <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>control,</b> injunctive relief versus damages, personal injuries and economic losses, sector specificity vs. general instruments to protect consumers, public agencies vs. private organisations – provide the ground for preliminary thoughts on a revised theoretical approach. comparative law...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{theoretical}} {{literature has}} debated {{the desirability of}} permitting debtors to contract with lenders over control rights in bankruptcy. Proponents point to the monitoring benefits brought from concentrating control rights {{in the hands of}} a single lender. Detractors point to the costs imposed on other creditors by a senior claimant’s inadequate incentives to maximise net recoveries. The UK provides the setting for a natural experiment regarding these theories. Until recently, UK bankruptcy law permitted firms to give complete <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>control</b> to secured creditors, through a procedure known as Receivership. Receivership was replaced in 2003 by a new procedure, Administration, which was intended to introduce greater accountability to unsecured creditors to the governance of bankrupt firms, through a combination of voting rights and fiduciary duties. We present empirical findings from a hand-coded sample of 340 bankruptcies from both before and after the change in the law, supplemented with qualitative interview data. We find robust evidence that whilst gross realisations have increased following the change in the law, these have tended to be eaten up by concomitantly increased bankruptcy costs. The net result has been that creditor recoveries have remained unchanged. This implies that dispersed and concentrated creditor governance in bankruptcy may be functionally equivalent...|$|R
40|$|Résumé The {{presented}} work {{addresses the}} issue of the double-tracking nature of a dominant position in European competition law. The aim of the integration efforts during the establishment of the EU was the creation of an internal market, especially the customs union. In order to achieve this state, it was necessary to take a number of integration measures and create a legal framework, i. e. conditions, under which economic competition in the internal market could operate effectively. In this context a variety of legislation valid for the whole EU territory has been accepted. However, {{in the context of the}} economic competition this work analyzes the legislation on market dominance carried out first in Article 102 of TFEU (Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) prohibiting restrictive business practices in the form of abuse of a dominant position and also in Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064 / 89 and later in Council Regulation (EC) No 139 / 2004 regulating the control of concentrations between undertakings. In case of both the legislations the crucial question is the "dominant position" of an enterprise in the market, while Article 102 of TFEU represents the <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>control,</b> i. e. applies only to the possible abuse of the dominant position, and in this sense the dominant position itself is not the [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Using three {{measures}} of covenant restrictiveness, I examine {{the association between}} the ex ante design of debt covenant restrictiveness and the <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> exercise of creditor control rights. I find that contracts with higher level of covenant restrictiveness at loan origination {{are more likely to}} subsequently experience both covenant violations and renegotiations, suggesting that stricter covenants translate into more frequent exercise of creditor control rights. Further, I find that the specific channel through which creditor control rights are exercised is influenced by the type of the most restrictive covenant in the original contract. Overall, my results imply that the ex ante design of covenant restrictiveness {{plays an important role in}} the <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> transfer of <b>control</b> rights...|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{effectiveness}} of international criminal justice setting out from the doctrinal thesis of the “integrated law-enforcement system” based on the “shared governance” of public functions between State and international institutions. Particularly, the aims of this article are: to test whether the same integration exists {{in the areas of}} individual criminal responsibility and the international criminal justice system; to determine if the current system of international criminal justice, and in particular that established by the ICC Statute, is satisfactory; to verify whether the 2010 Review Conference of the ICC Statute has improved international criminal justice; to examine if the practices of both ICC and other institutions have produced any further improvements; and finally, to explore the necessary reforms to be made in order to turn the ICC into a more effective international criminal justice institution. We support the view that complementarity must be newly construed to render it operational and that attention has to be paid to its “positive” dimension. However, in cases where territorial or national States are unable or unwilling to prosecute the crimes or where they are not Party to ICC Statute, positive complementarity must be “enhanced” by the vertical role played by international institutions. A “positive-enhanced” approach combines the “vertical subsidiarity” of the “integrated law-enforcement system” with a “horizontal” understanding of complementarity, and spreads the co-management of criminal justice throughout all stages of the law-enforcement system (preventive ascertainment, criminal proceeding, <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>control)</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{international}} law and its instruments are stagnating {{both in terms of}} quantity and quality. New, alternative forms of cross-border cooperation, in particular processes of informal {{international law}}making, have emerged and gained prominence since the 2000 s in response to an increasingly diverse, networked, and knowledge-based society. This transformation impacts on the three axes of actors, processes and outputs in the international legal order. We challenge the assumption that traditional international law is, by definition, legitimate and that this would not be the case for new forms of informal lawmaking: whereas traditional international law is often based on “thin state consent”, a “thick stakeholder consensus” underlies many of the new forms of cooperation. It is submitted that the evolution in the international legal order demands an adjustment of models to keep both new forms of cooperation and traditional international law in check. This paper thereto assesses the legitimacy of international legal processes, tackling also the question whether new forms benefit powerful actors and how to keep activity accountable, both domestically and internationally, towards internal and external stakeholders, through ex ante, ongoing and <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms, involving not only managerial or administrative checks and balances but also political and judicial oversight. The paper furthermore examines whether some of the new outputs of international cooperation could already be seen as part of traditional {{international law and}} how traditional and new forms are (or could be) interacting before international courts and tribunals. To conclude, a redefinition of the academic discipline of international law to keep both the field and its students sociologically relevant is proposed...|$|R
40|$|The {{numerus clausus}} of {{property}} rights {{is one of the}} fundamental principles of property law. It refers to the idea that both the number and content {{of property rights}} is limited and is traditionally placed in contrast to party autonomy, which reigns in contract law. Parties can only shape their property rights when they stay within the boundaries provided for by the legal system. Such boundaries are provided by both legislation and case law. Numerus clausus can be understood as a principle, but also as a rule, depending on how strictly it is applied. It can be viewed from a legal perspective, but also from a constitutional or economic point of view, which enhances understanding of why the idea of numerus clausus exists as well as understanding of how it is supposed to function. Numerus clausus also plays a different role within a legal system than it does in respect to the effect of foreign law. There numerus clausus becomes a defensive mechanism. With this more thorough understanding, the practice of numerus clausus can be examined. How do we know a numerus clausus exists and which property rights are part of the numerus clausus? Various authors have argued for a less rigid approach to numerus clausus, possibly looking at <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> <b>control</b> rather than <b>ex</b> ante rigidity. They connect the need for flexibility to the increasingly dynamic nature of property law. Much has been done to discover why numerus clausus exists, but not so much on what role it can play in the future development of property law...|$|R
40|$|EU-SILC {{will become}} one of the most {{important}} statistical data sources for the Federal Government's future Poverty and Wealth Reports, for comparing Germany's position with those of the other EU member states in the "open method of coordination", and for the international scientific community and international organisations. Hence this sample needs intensive quality control to ensure data quality. Ex ante quality control must take the form of selecting suitable survey methods, internal control of consistency of the data collected from each household, transparent data editing, reliable imputation methods and compensation for drop-outs by reweighting. <b>Ex</b> <b>post</b> consistency checks are needed in the form of comparison with other similar household samples, with administrative statistics and with macro-economic aggregates of the national accounts. In this paper the need for intensive <b>ex</b> <b>post</b> quality <b>control</b> is met with consistency checks in the form of a comparison between the results of EU-SILC and the microcensus and SOEP, which reveals significant deviations in the coverage of poorly integrated foreigners, small children and the level of education, as well as the ratio of house/apartment owners and the employment ratio. This causes serious distortions to the Laeken indicators calculated. Intergenerational Mobility, Germany...|$|R
