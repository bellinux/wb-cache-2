Through a collective memory and discourse framework, this study reviews the overlap and disparity in perceptions of <b>environmental</b> <b>movements</b> in the Soviet Union and Russia. The portrait that emerges from {{the analysis of the}} <b>environmental</b> <b>movements</b> suggests that the impact of <b>environmental</b> <b>movements</b> in Russia may be limited in part because it has developed in contravention to existing discourses. More importantly, the context and underlying assumptions of <b>environmental</b> <b>movements</b> are not formulated in ways that are compatible with existing collective identities in Russian society...|$|R

5|$|DDT {{was banned}} in the US in 1972, after the {{discussion}} opened in 1962 by Silent Spring, written by American biologist Rachel Carson, which launched the <b>environmental</b> <b>movement</b> in the West. The book catalogued {{the environmental impacts of}} indiscriminate DDT spraying and suggested that DDT and other pesticides cause cancer and that their agricultural use was a threat to wildlife. The U.S. Agency for International Development supports indoor DDT spraying as a vital component of malaria control programs and has initiated DDT and other insecticide spraying programs in tropical countries.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, marine {{biologist}} and ecologist Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring helped {{to mobilize the}} <b>environmental</b> <b>movement</b> by alerting the public to toxic pesticides, such as DDT, bioaccumulating in the environment. Carson used ecological science to link the release of environmental toxins to human and ecosystem health. Since then, ecologists have worked to bridge {{their understanding of the}} degradation of the planet's ecosystems with environmental politics, law, restoration, and natural resources management.|$|E
5|$|The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement (VHEMT) is an <b>environmental</b> <b>movement</b> {{that calls}} for all people to abstain from {{reproduction}} to cause the gradual voluntary extinction of humankind. VHEMT supports human extinction primarily because, in the group's view, it would prevent environmental degradation. The group states that {{a decrease in the}} human population would prevent a significant amount of human-caused suffering. The extinctions of non-human species and the scarcity of resources required by humans are frequently cited by the group as evidence of the harm caused by human overpopulation.|$|E

40|$|Arturo Escobar, Dianne Rocheleau and Smitu Kothari {{examine the}} growing {{relevance}} of <b>environmental</b> <b>movements</b> {{in the world}} today, and their importance for a women-centred politics of place. They argue that many of today's <b>environmental</b> <b>movements</b> are largely struggles for the defence of place, and that for historical reasons women are often located {{at the forefront of}} these struggles and are hence central to any politics of place. The authors suggest that there is a mutually beneficial convergence between women's and <b>environmental</b> <b>movements,</b> a synergy and enrichment that finds a meeting ground in place.

5|$|The <b>environmental</b> <b>movement</b> in the American Southwest {{has opposed}} the damming and {{diversion}} of the Colorado River system because of detrimental {{effects on the}} ecology and natural beauty of the river and its tributaries. During the construction of Glen Canyon Dam, environmental organizations vowed to block any further development of the river, and a number of later dam and aqueduct proposals were defeated by citizen opposition. As demands for Colorado River water continue to rise, the level of human development and control of the river continues to generate controversy.|$|E
5|$|Ecology surged {{in popular}} and {{scientific}} interest during the 1960–1970s <b>environmental</b> <b>movement.</b> There are strong historical and scientific ties between ecology, environmental management, and protection. The historical emphasis and poetic naturalistic writings advocating {{the protection of}} wild places by notable ecologists {{in the history of}} conservation biology, such as Aldo Leopold and Arthur Tansley, have been seen as far removed from urban centres where, it is claimed, the concentration of pollution and environmental degradation is located. Palamar (2008) notes an overshadowing by mainstream environmentalism of pioneering women in the early 1900s who fought for urban health ecology (then called euthenics) and brought about changes in environmental legislation. Women such as Ellen Swallow Richards and Julia Lathrop, among others, were precursors to the more popularized environmental movements after the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Late in the 1950s, Carson {{turned her}} {{attention}} to conservation, especially some problems that she believed were caused by synthetic pesticides. The result was the book Silent Spring (1962), which brought environmental concerns to an unprecedented share of the American people. Although Silent Spring was met with fierce opposition by chemical companies, it spurred a reversal in national pesticide policy, which led to a nationwide ban on DDT and other pesticides. It also inspired a grassroots <b>environmental</b> <b>movement</b> that {{led to the creation of}} the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Carson was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Jimmy Carter.|$|E

The film grossed $24 million in the U.S. and $26 million at the international box office, becoming the tenth highest grossing documentary film to date in the United States. Since the film's release, An Inconvenient Truth has been credited for raising international public awareness of global warming and reenergizing the <b>environmental</b> <b>movement.</b> The documentary has also been included in science curricula in schools around the world, which has spurred some controversy.

5|$|The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement {{was founded}} by Les U. Knight, a high school {{substitute}} teacher who lives in Portland, Oregon. After becoming involved in the <b>environmental</b> <b>movement</b> {{as a college student}} in the 1970s, Knight attributed most of the dangers faced by the planet to human overpopulation. He joined the Zero Population Growth organization, and chose to be vasectomised at age 25. He later concluded that the extinction of humanity would be the best solution to the Earth's environmental problems. He believes that this idea has also been held by some people throughout human history.|$|E
5|$|The Western {{industrial}} {{revolution of the}} 18th to 19th centuries tapped into the vast growth potential of the energy in fossil fuels. Coal was used to power ever more efficient engines and later to generate electricity. Modern sanitation systems and advances in medicine protected large populations from disease. In the mid-20th century, a gathering <b>environmental</b> <b>movement</b> {{pointed out that there}} were environmental costs associated with the many material benefits that were now being enjoyed. In the late 20th century, environmental problems became global in scale. The 1973 and 1979 energy crises demonstrated {{the extent to which the}} global community had become dependent on non-renewable energy resources.|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} <b>environmental</b> <b>movements</b> {{has become one}} of the {{important}} discourses in academics and it has a number of aspects. This article investigates the determinant factors of success and failure of <b>environmental</b> <b>movements</b> in India based on a comparative analysis of the colonial regime, postindependence regime, and the more recent era of liberalization. During the colonial period, all the movements were suppressed by the authoritarian British regime except the movement in Kumaun and Garhwal, due to its strategic importance as a border region. Similarly, the democratic regime of India suppressed many movements in the early postindependence era. However, starting in the mid- 1970 s, <b>environmental</b> <b>movements</b> began to achieve some success, when these movements were supported by various national and international human rights groups, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and activists. The movements during the 1960 s and 1970 s were suppressed by the democratic state, because they did not have this kind of support. The factors that were responsible for the success of the <b>environmental</b> <b>movements</b> in the late 1970 s and 1980 s have not produced as much success in the more recent era of liberalization. The rising nexus and collaboration between the state and multinational corporations have led to the suppression of more recent <b>environmental</b> <b>movements</b> and those that have been successful have received strong support from opposition political parties. environmental movements; ecological degradation; liberalization; tribals; Indi...|$|R

40|$|<b>Environmental</b> <b>movements</b> are {{networks}} of informal interactions that may include individuals, groups, and organizations engaged in collective action motivated by shared identity or concern about environmental issues. This article reviews literature on <b>environmental</b> <b>movements</b> (including antinuclear energy movements) according to four main aspects: the social bases and values underlying the movements’ mobilization, the resources support- ing their mobilization, the political opportunities channeling their mobilization, {{and the cultural}} framing processes through which environmental issues are defined as social and political problems to be addressed through mobilization. In addition, we consider the historical antecedents and roots of <b>environmental</b> <b>movements.</b> Finally, we discuss the interplay between the local and the global levels and the movements’ impacts, a long neglected issue in the social movement literature. Our review highlights three main features of environmental movements: they are heterogeneous; they have profoundly transformed themselves; and they have generally become more institutionalized...|$|R
5|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding the Rampart Dam project illustrated the growing {{shift in the}} <b>environmental</b> <b>movement</b> during the 1960s. Rather than becoming focused singularly on solely preserving {{the natural beauty of}} a particular landscape, as had inspired the creation of the U.S. National Park Service in the United States {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century, naturalists and environmentalists began to consider the human cost of development as well. Though opposition to Rampart was founded primarily on economic and natural grounds, it consequences for the Alaska Native population in the region reflected later concerns about industrial development in more urban areas.|$|E
5|$|VHEMT {{was founded}} in 1991 by Les U. Knight, an American activist who became {{involved}} in the <b>environmental</b> <b>movement</b> in the 1970s and thereafter concluded that human extinction was the best solution to the problems facing the Earth's biosphere and humanity. Knight publishes the group's newsletter and serves as its spokesman. Although the group is promoted by a website and represented at some environmental events, it relies heavily on coverage from outside media to spread its message. Many commentators view its platform as unacceptably extreme, though other writers have applauded VHEMT's perspective. In response to VHEMT, some journalists and academics have argued that humans can develop sustainable lifestyles or can reduce their population to sustainable levels. Others maintain that, whatever the merits of the idea, the human reproductive drive will prevent humankind from ever voluntarily seeking extinction.|$|E
5|$|In March 1959, Tulare County {{approved}} {{a change in}} location of the proposed highway to Olancha Pass (Haiwee Pass, just to the south, was soon considered for a possible alternate location), and the legislature moved the main line of Route 127 south to that location, crossing US 395 at Olancha, later that year. The old route from southeast of Keeler to Lone Pine remained as a branch, and was still signed as SR 190. Also in 1959, the original routing from Lone Pine through Death Valley to Baker {{was added to the}} proposed California Freeway and Expressway System, though no parts have been upgraded as such. The eastwest piece between Tipton and Death Valley Junction legislatively received the State Route 190 designation in the 1964 renumbering, and the north–south part became State Route 127, as it had been signed; the branch to Lone Pine became a new State Route 136. By the mid-1970s, the <b>environmental</b> <b>movement</b> had essentially killed the planned connection, and the designation of the Golden Trout Wilderness in 1978 and South Sierra Wilderness in 1984 were the final blow, though Caltrans still has an officially adopted alignment designated over Haiwee Pass.|$|E

5|$|Increased {{urbanization}} and industrialization in Europe and North America {{resulted in}} an opposing aesthetic transcendentalist movement characterized in New England by the art of Thomas Cole, Frederic Edwin Church, and other Hudson River School painters, the work of landscape architects such as Frederick Law Olmsted, and the writings of philosophers such as Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson. As was true of other scenic areas of New England, the philosophical, artistic, and <b>environmental</b> <b>movement</b> of transcendentalism transformed the Metacomet Ridge from a commercial resource to a recreational resource. Hotels, parks, and summer estates were built on the mountains from the mid-1880s to the early 20th century. Notable structures included summit hotels and inns on Mount Holyoke, Mount Tom, Sugarloaf Mountain, and Mount Nonotuck. Parks and park structures such as Poet's Seat in Greenfield, Massachusetts, and Hubbard Park (designed {{with the help of}} Frederick Law Olmsted) of the Hanging Hills of Meriden, Connecticut, were intended as respites from the urban areas they closely abutted. Estates such as Hill-Stead and Heublein Tower were built as mountain home retreats by local industrialists and commercial investors. Although public attention gradually shifted to more remote and less developed destinations with the advent of modern transportation and the westward expansion of the United States, the physical, cultural, and historic legacy of that early recreational interest in the Metacomet Ridge still supports modern conservation efforts. Estates became museums; old hotels and the lands they occupied, frequently subject to damaging fires, became state and municipal parkland through philanthropic donation, purchase, or confiscation for unpaid taxes. Nostalgia among former guests of hotels and estates contributed to the aesthetic of conservation.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1980s, {{the most}} {{reproduced}} and publicized of Bauer's works were two paintings depicting the princess and the moose from Sagan om älgtjuren Skutt och lilla prinsessan Tuvstarr (The Tale of the Moose Hop and the Little Princess Cotton Grass), published in 1913. The first picture {{is of the}} princess riding on the moose {{and the second is}} of the moose standing guard over the sleeping princess. They were mainly used as pictures on the wall in nurseries. The same tale also contains the picture of Tuvstarr gazing down into the tarn looking for her lost heart, an allegory of innocence lost. Bauer made several studies of this motif. During the 1980s the painting of Tuvstarr and the tarn was used in advertising for a shampoo. This started a debate in Sweden about how works of art, considered part of the national heritage, should be used. In 1999, the picture again appeared in advertising, this time in a manipulated version in which all the trees had been cut down and Tuvstarr seemed to be lamenting them. The award-winning advertising campaign was made by the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation and helped further the newly awakened <b>environmental</b> <b>movement</b> in Sweden. In his biography on Bauer, Gunnar Lindqvist argues that the picture has become too commercialized.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is {{to show how the}} extent of {{democracy}} in two Eastern European societies has a strong conditioning effect on the development of social movements. Hungary and Russia are chosen as contrasting cases. The experience of <b>environmental</b> <b>movements</b> before and after the regime change is used as an illustration of grassroots movements. It is shown that <b>environmental</b> <b>movements</b> in Hungary are more numerous and more successful than those in Russia, and that this is linked to the extent of support they have (or lack) from politicians, nonelected officials, and the media. In Hungary, although ecological issues are not central, politicians and environmental groups mostly co-operate, whereas in Russia the relationship is either hesitant or sometimes even hostile. In both countries, however, apparatchiks are generally a lot more opposed to grassroots groups, such as environmental ones, but their weaker position in Hungary compared with Russia cancels out this effect. Finally, the media in Hungary have been sympathetic to environmental issues and they are also supportive of the <b>environmental</b> <b>movements.</b> In contrast, however, in Russia, after Yeltsin's arrival in power 'glasnost' has been largely reversed and the media have also been hostile to environmental groups. In sum, the position of the media, politicians and officials shapes the prospects for <b>environmental</b> <b>movements</b> and is an index of the differing degree of democracy in the two societies...|$|R
