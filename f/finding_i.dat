40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a novel adaptive control methodology for uncertain systems with time-varying unknown parameters and time-varying bounded disturbances. The adap-tive controller ensures uniformly bounded transient and asymp-totic tracking for system’s both signals, input and output, simultaneously. The performance bounds can be systematically improved {{by increasing the}} adaptation rate. Simulations of a robotic arm with time-varying friction verify the theoretical <b>findings.</b> <b>I...</b>|$|R

Relying on linear constellation precoders designed in closedform for coherent multi-antenna systems, we derive a nonconstant modulus space-time differential scheme that enables diversity, does not sacrifice rate, and more interestingly, it allows for constellation designs with many degrees of freedom. Performance merits of this scheme are analyzed and compared with existing differential designs. Simulations corroborate our theoretical <b>findings.</b> <b>I...</b>|$|R
