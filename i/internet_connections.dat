Valve approached several companies, including Microsoft, Yahoo!, and RealNetworks to build a client with these features, but were declined.|$|E
40|$|The {{increase}} of smartphone ability is rapidly increasing the power consumption. Many {{methods have been}} proposed to reduce smartphone power consumption. Most of these methods use the <b>internet</b> <b>connection</b> control based {{on the availability of}} the battery power level regardless of when and where a waste of energy occurs. This paper proposes a new approach to control the <b>internet</b> <b>connection</b> based on idle time using user behavior pattern analysis. User behavior patterns are used to predict idle time duration. <b>Internet</b> <b>connection</b> control performed during idle time. During idle time <b>internet</b> <b>connection</b> periodically switched on and off by a certain time interval. This method effectively reduces a waste of energy. Control of the <b>internet</b> <b>connection</b> does not interfere the user because it is implemented on idle time.
