25|$|In {{some cases}} the {{particles}} will, due to their higher density, not perfectly follow {{the motion of the}} fluid (gas/liquid). If experiments are done in water, for instance, it is <b>easily</b> <b>possible</b> to find very cheap particles (e.g. plastic powder with a diameter of ~60µm) with the same density as water. If the density still does not fit, the density of the fluid can be tuned by increasing/ decreasing its temperature. This leads to slight changes in the Reynolds number, so the fluid velocity or the size of the experimental object has to be changed to account for this.|$|E
25|$|American white {{pelicans}} like to {{come together}} in groups of {{a dozen or more}} birds to feed, as they can thus cooperate and corral fish to one another. When this is not <b>easily</b> <b>possible</b> – for example in deep water, where fish can escape by diving out of reach –, they prefer to forage alone. But the birds also steal food on occasion from other birds, a practice known as kleptoparasitism. White pelicans are known to steal fish from other pelicans, gulls and cormorants {{from the surface of the}} water and, in one case, from a great blue heron while both large birds were in flight.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, the Seattle Times {{reported}} that pistachio makers in California were unhappy {{about the fact}} that Israel imported most of its pistachio from Iran. The head of Iran-China economic room, Asadollah Asgaroladi said in the article that such transactions are <b>easily</b> <b>possible.</b> Based on the article Israel imports only a quarter of pistachios from US and about half of its pistachios from Britain and Germany, whereas these two countries are not producers of pistachio at all and the source is very likely to be from Iran. Furthermore, in 1998 Israeli government punished the Hamama Brothers Co. for illegally importing 105 tonnes of pistachio from Iran. Israeli newspaper Ynet reported in 2007 that US government once again asked Israeli government to stop importing pistachios from Iran. In 2008 US ambassador to Israel, Richard H. Jones wrote a letter to Israel's finance minister Ronnie Bar-on demanding Israel to stop importing Iranian pistachios from Turkey. Similar reports have been published by Haaretz.|$|E

25|$|The {{mechanism}} was {{operated by}} turning a small hand crank (now lost) which was linked via {{a crown gear}} to the largest gear, the four-spoked gear visible {{on the front of}} fragment A, the gear named b1. This moved the date pointer on the front dial, which would be set to the correct Egyptian calendar day. The year is not selectable, so it is necessary to know the year currently set, or by looking up the cycles indicated by the various calendar cycle indicators on the back in the Babylonian ephemeris tables for the day of the year currently set, since most of the calendar cycles are not synchronous with the year. The crank moves the date pointer about 78 days per full rotation, so hitting a particular day on the dial would be <b>easily</b> <b>possible</b> if the mechanism were in good working condition. The action of turning the hand crank would also cause all interlocked gears within the mechanism to rotate, resulting in the simultaneous calculation of the position of the Sun and Moon, the moon phase, eclipse, and calendar cycles, and perhaps the locations of planets.|$|E

60|$|She obeyed {{the word}} without one second's delay. I slipped off, held the bridle, caught the bicycle, and led it instantaneously.

It was all done nimbly, {{in less time than}} the telling takes, for we are both of us {{naturally}} quick in our movements. Hilda rode like a man, astride--her short, bicycling skirt, unobtrusively divided in front and at the back, made this <b>easily</b> <b>possible.</b> Looking behind me with a hasty glance, I could see that the savages, taken aback, had reined in to deliberate at our unwonted evolution. I feel sure that the novelty of the iron horse, with a woman riding it, played not a little on their superstitious fears; they suspected, no doubt, this was some ingenious new engine of war devised against them by the unaccountable white man; it might go off unexpectedly in their faces at any moment. Most of them, I observed, as they halted, carried on their backs black ox-hide shields, interlaced with white thongs; they were armed with two or three assegais apiece and a knobkerry.|$|E
60|$|This latter {{document}} {{was a great}} puzzle to our friends, who, on reflecting that its bewildering categories took account of breakfast alone, had the uneasy prevision of an encyclopedic dinner-list.

It was perforated {{from end to end}} with immense bare corridors, through which a strong draught freely blew, bearing along wonderful figures of ladies in white morning-dresses and clouds of Valenciennes lace, who floated down the endless vistas on expanded furbelows very much as angels spread their wings. In front was a gigantic verandah on which an army might have encamped—a vast wooden terrace with a roof as high as the nave of a cathedral. Here our young men enjoyed, as they supposed, a glimpse of American society, which was distributed over the measureless expanse in a variety of sedentary attitudes and appeared to consist largely of pretty young girls, dressed as for a fête champêtre, swaying to and fro in rocking-chairs, fanning themselves with large straw fans and enjoying an enviable exemption from social cares.
