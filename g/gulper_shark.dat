Males mature sexually at [...] long and females at [...] long. The average age at {{maturity}} is 4.0 years for males and 4.7 years for females, though four-year-old mature individuals of both sexes have {{been caught in the}} wild, along with immature females over eight years old.

50|$|Male <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> tend to outnumber females 2:1, {{which is}} common for many fish species. The life {{expectancy}}, longevity, of female <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> ranges between 54 and 70 years. Having a long life expectancy but a low net reproduction rate suggests that the population of <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> would be {{at a very high}} risk if too many of them were killed from excessive fishing.|$|R
50|$|Female <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> {{typically}} have between 2 and 10 pups in their lifetime, with generally one pup per pregnancy, this {{is considered to}} be a low fecundity. Once fertilized, females can hold up to 6 mature egg cells, or oocytes, in their body at a time. The length of time these egg cells are kept inside the female’s body is called the gestation period. <b>Gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> have a long gestation period, around two years. <b>Gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> can have long resting periods between pregnancies.|$|R
50|$|On average, male <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> {{are smaller}} than females. The size of an average adult male is 80 to 95 cm. The size of an average adult female is from 90 to 100 cm long. Differences in size between the sexes {{may be due to}} the need for space to support offspring. It has been {{hypothesized}} that <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> display a “depth distribution pattern associated with size” based on random human observation.|$|R

50|$|Lowfin <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> live at depths between 300 and 1,400 m. They are {{ovoviviparous}} {{and give}} birth to up to six pups per litter. They feed on other sharks, bony fish, crabs, and lobsters.|$|R
50|$|While {{the fishing}} of <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> and {{utilization}} of squalene from their livers is not inherently {{an activity that}} drives them toward extinction, overexploitation of the species can be a problem. The status of <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> on the ICUN red list is currently only vulnerable rather than endangered. The squalene taken from the gulper liver is in high demand as a possible cancer therapy component among other uses, leading to unchecked harvesting of the species. When the populations are declining due to overexploitation, each viable individual is important. As much as 80% of the gulper population has been depleted in some areas, so any harvesting can have a large effect on {{the decline of the}} species or possible recovery.|$|R

50|$|A long {{gestation}} period, later maturity, {{and long}} lifespan {{all contribute to}} a K-selected tendency that favors intraspecific competition, or competition with similar species, over survival defenses {{having to do with}} predation. Harvesting is a form of predation that slow, invested reproduction does not easily alleviate. The long gestation, low fecundity, and breaks in individual reproduction lead to slow repopulation ability. Slow reproduction {{is a part of the}} species biology, and cannot be changed in one generation based on sudden predation pressure. A group of <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> that undergoes predation by humans may take fifteen years or longer to recover, if at all, based on their maturation time of twelve to sixteen years.

50|$|Gulper life {{strategy}} is {{also consistent with}} their trophic level and place in the deepwater community.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{isolated}} teeth of <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> (genus Centrophorus Müller & Henle, 1837) {{have been recovered}} from Neogene sands in the Antwerp area, marking the first occurrence of the genus Centrophorus in the fossil record of Belgium and the North Sea Basin. The precise stratigraphic origin of these teeth could not be established, but the taphonomic condition strongly suggests a Late Miocene or Early Pliocene age, although reworking from older Miocene strata cannot be excluded. These teeth are remarkable {{for the presence of}} serrated cutting edges of both upper and lower teeth as well as their large size. The teeth, that measure up to 1 cm, are the largest fossil Centrophorus reported in literature. The subtle differences between the teeth of different Centrophorus species and the paucity of comparative extant material prohibit specific attribution, but the teeth pertain to individuals that equalled the largest extant species. The occurrence of these large Centrophorus in the Belgian deposits is remarkable as Centrophorus usually prefers deeper waters...|$|R
50|$|While {{not many}} laws apply to <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> specifically, some blanket laws {{covering}} many different {{species have been}} created. The United States Government passed the Shark Conservation Act in 2010, which prohibited removing fins from sharks that were usually caught as bycatch and then sold to Chinese markets for shark fin soup. This law seals many of loopholes by requiring that any fins or tails brought to land must be “naturally attached to the corresponding carcass” and that no U.S. ship in foreign waters is allowed to possess shark fins. This act protects all species of sharks within 50 nautical miles of the U.S. coast. This {{is a much more}} effective law than that by the GFCM, because it addresses shark finning directly and cuts down on the amount of gulpers killed for their fins. Since this law point-blank cuts down on bycatching, it should be an effective effort at the conservation of shark species off U.S. coasts.|$|R

40|$|Portuguese {{commercial}} Elasmobranch landings were {{analysed for}} the period 1986 – 2009 and revealed that some species may be in danger of overfishing. Landings totalled 122, 515 mt, {{with an average of}} 5, 105 mt landed yearly, with captured sharks, skates and rays representing 8 orders, 14 families and 44 species. Annual landings for the fishery generally decreased over time, with a corresponding increase in price per kilogram. The most landed group, skates (Raja sp.), accounted for 33 % of the landings, or 40, 344 mt. They were followed by lesser spotted catsharks (Scyliorhinus sp.), Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis), leafscale <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> (Centrophorus squamosus), blue sharks (Prionace glauca) and <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> (Centrophorus granulosus) (accounting for 12 %, 11 %, 10 %, 9 % and 8 % of the landings, respectively). In the absence of CPUE data, comparative trends of landings and price over time were used as an indicator of the status of specific Elasmobranch species. Centrophorus granulosus, smoothounds (Mustelus sp.), torpedo rays (Torpedo sp.), requiem sharks (Carcharhinus sp.) and angel sharks (Squatina sp.) displayed indications of possible over-exploitation, with significantly decreasing landings and increasing prices over time, and merit the focus of future research. The pattern shown by fishing effort over time (i. e. number of fishing vessels over time) displayed a marked decrease, although this was substantially less than the decrease shown by landings of the species mentioned earlier. It is therefore unlikely that such a decrease in landings is justified solely by a decrease in number of fishing vessels. Similarly, the increase in price shown for all species was largely superior to the increase in inflation, which would suggest that the increase in inflation alone would not account for the increase in price. All results and data corroborate the notion that some species are, in fact, over-exploited and in need of immediate management and conservation measurements. These findings were substantiated by min/max auto-correlation factor analysis (MAFA), which shows that the most important trend is that of a decrease in landings of those species where overfishing in indicated.

5|$|Until recently, Portugal was {{the only}} European country to utilize the Portuguese dogfish. An {{important}} bycatch of the black scabbardfish (Aphanops carbo) longline fishery, between 300 and 900 tons of this shark were landed annually from 1986 to 1999. Its per-weight value has been increasing since 1986, and thus exploitation is likely to continue. Around 1990, French bottom trawlers began to fish for Portuguese dogfish and leafscale <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> (Centrophorus squamosus) west of the British Isles for meat and livers; these two species are together referred to as siki. The siki catch peaked at 3,284 tons in 1996 before declining to 1,939 tons in 1999. The French have since been joined by Norwegian, Irish, and Scottish longliners and trawlers, making the Portuguese dogfish a significant component of deepwater fisheries in the northwest Atlantic. While stocks off Portugal seem to be stable for now, stocks off the British Isles have diminished substantially in recent years; this may reflect the disparity between the less massified Portuguese fishery and the commercial French fishery. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened, because of its commercial value and low reproductive productivity.|$|R
