By early 1878 the project took an increasing amount of his attention; in February he started writing in earnest, and he finished the opera by early November.|$|E

5|$|Independence {{talks between}} Britain and Rhodesia {{continued}} for a fortnight without major {{reference to the}} Reedman appointment, with Britain more concerned with discussing a possible Rhodesian unilateral declaration of independence (UDI). Smith delivered an openly defiant speech to his parliament on 30 June, attacking Britain for its handling of the Commonwealth's newer members, which he said were unduly influencing British policy in Africa. Britain was desperate to avoid the international humiliation that would accompany the organisation's break-up, he claimed, and was therefore attempting to hold <b>it</b> <b>together</b> by appeasing the less prominent members. While making clear his disdain, the Prime Minister pledged {{to go on with}} negotiations, saying that he did not believe Britain truly endorsed its professed line.|$|E

5|$|The Word for World is Forest {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} Hainish universe, which Le Guin {{introduced}} in her first novel Rocannon's World, published in 1966. In this alternative history, human beings did not evolve on earth, but on Hain. The people of Hain colonized many neighboring planetary systems, including Terra (Earth) and Athshe, possibly a million years before the setting of the novels. The planets subsequently lost contact with each other, for reasons that Le Guin does not explain. Le Guin does not narrate the entire history of the Hainish universe at once, instead letting readers piece <b>it</b> <b>together</b> from various works.|$|E

5|$|When Leakey {{took the}} position, the {{organization}} had 12 tons of confiscated illegal ivory in its possession, {{which he was}} urged to sell in order to fund conservation efforts. Instead, he piled all of <b>it</b> <b>together</b> and, with Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, set it on fire. Ivory does not easily burn, but the choice to use fire rather than other means to destroy it was intentional as Leakey wanted the event to produce powerful images for the global media. To make the destruction spectacular, Leakey worked with a Hollywood special effects professional to devise an innovative pyrotechnics technique using jet fuel and flammable glue.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{did not use}} the 3D {{graphics}} which Armok {{had since}} its development was hampered because of it. He cited the ease in development of features like fluid simulation, copyright issues with the art and more unhindered possibilities as further reasons for not using it. Being used to the text-based graphics in roguelikes, he did not want graphical tilesets. The story-generation originated first from Armok, although present to some extent in dragslay. Tarn and Zach would write different chapters of events they would like to see, mix <b>it</b> <b>together</b> and try to implement it. Most of this story writing is managed by Zach, who has a role in the game's development. He graduated in ancient history and books like The Twelve Caesars and the writings of Assyrian kings influenced the game.|$|E
