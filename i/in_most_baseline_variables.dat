The success of IVF is limited, and the procedure is costly, time-consuming, and poses physical and emotional health risks to the patient. Therefore, generating personalized probabilities of live birth may assist patients and clinicians in decision-making. We sought to examine the ability of individual biomarkers, including anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH, a biomarker of ovarian reserve), and multivariable models to predict the probability of live birth prior to initiating stimulation for IVF. Methods: We included fresh, autologous IVF cycles initiated between 2005 and 2011 from five U. S. infertility clinics. We developed and validated multivariable models predicting probabilities of live birth in 23, 154 first IVF cycles, {{as well as in}} 8, 184 second IVF cycles after a single prior failed cycle using varying levels of model complexity: (a) backwards stepwise logistic regression (p> 0. 2) with only parameter main effects, (b) with main effects and interactions, and (c) boosted regression trees. For first cycles, eligible predictors included those obtained at the baseline infertility evaluation (e. g., demographics, anthropometrics, pregnancy history, infertility diagnosis, stimulation protocol); which were also examined in second cycles in addition to the treatment response in the previous failed cycle (e. g., dose of gonadotropins, egg and embryo characteristics, cycle outcome, etc.). For comparison, we fit age category and linear age models. Due to missing data we imputed 15 datatsets using multiple imputation by chained equations. In the 20 % of data reserved for validation, we estimated the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), area under the ROC curve (AUC), and the difference in AUCs between all models, along with bootstrapped 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). In a subsample of data from a single clinic, we evaluated the ability of AMH to predict live birth in all fresh, autologous IVF cycles from 2010 - 2011 (N= 834) and compared to widely collected biomarkers of ovarian reserve, including age, antral follicle count (AFC), and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). We estimated the ROC curves, AUCs, and difference in AUCs between biomarkers, along with bootstrapped 95 % CIs. We also evaluated the performance of AMH within subgroups based on age, body mass index (BMI), polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) status, and infertility diagnosis. Results: In first IVF cycles, all predictors were included in the main effects and interactions model. All multivariable models performed similarly (AUCs= 0. 67, 95 % CIs= 0. 66, 0. 69) and only slightly better than age-based models (age category AUC= 0. 64, 95 % CI= 0. 63, 0. 65; linear age AUC= 0. 65, 95 % CI= 0. 64, 0. 67). In second IVF cycles, many variables from the failed first cycle were included as predictors <b>in</b> addition to <b>most</b> <b>baseline</b> <b>variables.</b> Multivariable models performed only slightly better than age-based models (AUCs= 0. 63), with AUCs ranging from 0. 67 (main effects, 95 % CI= 0. 65, 0. 70) to 0. 72 (boosted regression, 95 % CI= 0. 68, 0. 77). When we examined individual biomarkers of ovarian reserve, AMH, age and FSH had similar performance with AUCs ranging from 0. 63 (95 % CI= 0. 59, 0. 67) to 0. 67 (95 % CI= 0. 64, 0. 71); FSH had the poorest performance (AUC= 0. 55, 95 % CI= 0. 51, 0. 59). Only FSH had a significantly different AUC from AMH (difference= 0. 08, 95 % CI= 0. 04, 0. 13). No substantial differences in AMH performance were observed within subgroups. Conclusion: Multivariable models performed only slightly better than simple age-based models or models based on other single biomarkers of ovarian reserve. There was very little improvement in accuracy with increasing model complexity, with small or no differences when using boosted regression compared to stepwise techniques. All models/individual predictors had only modest performance with AUCs below 0. 72. The minimal improvements in model performance for multivariable models are likely not substantial enough to warrant widespread clinical application, which would necessitate software development for calculating individualized probabilities. Despite the modest performance overall, there may be subgroups of women in whom the predictors and chance of live birth differ. Future investigations should examine whether models developed within relevant subgroups, such as those based on age, race, and diagnosis, have better performance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The goal of {{this cluster}} {{randomized}} trial is to test {{the effectiveness of a}} counseling approach, Motivational Interviewing, to control dental caries in young Aboriginal children. Motivational Interviewing, a client-centred, directive counseling style, has not yet been evaluated as an approach for promotion of behaviour change in indigenous communities in remote settings. Methods/design Aboriginal women were hired from the 9 communities to recruit expectant and new mothers to the trial, administer questionnaires and deliver the counseling to mothers in the test communities. The goal is for mothers to receive the intervention during pregnancy and at their child's immunization visits. Data on children's dental health status and family dental health practices will be collected when children are 30 -months of age. The communities were randomly allocated to test or control group by a random "draw" over community radio. Sample size and power were determined based on an anticipated 20 % reduction in caries prevalence. Randomization checks were conducted between groups. Discussion In the 5 test and 4 control communities, 272 of the original target sample size of 309 mothers have been recruited over a two-and-a-half year period. A power calculation using the actual attained sample size showed power to be 79 % to detect a treatment effect. If an attrition fraction of 4 % per year is maintained, power will remain at 80 %. Power will still be > 90 % to detect a 25 % reduction in caries prevalence. The distribution of <b>most</b> <b>baseline</b> <b>variables</b> was similar for the two randomized groups of mothers. However, despite the random assignment of communities to treatment conditions, group differences exist for stage of pregnancy and prior tooth extractions in the family. Because of the group imbalances on certain <b>variables,</b> control of <b>baseline</b> <b>variables</b> will be done in the analyses of treatment effects. This paper explains the challenges of conducting randomized trials in remote settings, the importance of thorough community collaboration, and also illustrates the likelihood that some <b>baseline</b> <b>variables</b> that may be clinically important will be unevenly split in group-randomized trials when the number of groups is small.

40|$|A wave rotor, {{which acts}} as a {{high-technology}} topping spool in gas turbine engines, can increase the effective pressure ratio {{as well as the}} turbine inlet temperature in such engines. The wave rotor topping, in other words, may significantly enhance engine performance by increasing shaft horse power while reducing specific fuel consumption. This performance enhancement requires optimum selection of the wave rotor's adjustable parameters for speed, surge margin, and temperature constraints specified on different engine components. To examine the benefit of the wave rotor concept in engine design, researchers soft coupled NASA Lewis Research Center's multidisciplinary optimization tool COMETBOARDS and the NASA Engine Performance Program (NEPP) analyzer. The COMETBOARDS-NEPP combined design tool has been successfully used to optimize wave-rotor-topped engines. For illustration, the design of a subsonic gas turbine wave-rotor-enhanced engine with four ports for 47 mission points (which are specified by Mach number, altitude, and power-setting combinations) is considered. The engine performance analysis, constraints, and objective formulations were carried out through NEPP, and COMETBOARDS was used for the design optimization. So that the benefits that accrue from wave rotor enhancement could be examined, <b>most</b> <b>baseline</b> <b>variables</b> and constraints were declared to be passive, whereas important parameters directly associated with the wave rotor were considered to be active for the design optimization. The engine thrust was considered as the merit function. The wave rotor engine design, which became a sequence of 47 optimization subproblems, was solved successfully by using a cascade strategy available in COMETBOARDS. The graph depicts the optimum COMETBOARDS solutions for the 47 mission points, which were normalized with respect to standard results. As shown, the combined tool produced higher thrust for all mission points than did the other solution, with maximum benefits around mission points 11, 25, and 31. Such improvements can become critical, especially when engines are sized for these specific mission points...|$|R

40|$|The {{preservative}} methylchloroisothiazolinone/methyl isothiazolinone (MCI/MI) is a wellknown sensitiser {{and present}} <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>baseline</b> series {{since at least}} 20 years. The proportions of MCI/MI are 3 : 1. MI alone {{has been used as}} a preservative in occupational and household products, and cosmetics since less than 10 years. MCI/ MI tested at 100 ppm fails to detect a significant percen tage of contactallergic reactions to MI. Our aim was to investigate whether a separate test preparation with MI picks up additional cases of contact allergy to MI not de tected with MCI/MI 200 ppm. MI was inserted into the baseline series of the MalmÃ¶ clinic in 2003 starting at 475 ppm, then 900 ppm, then 1, 000 ppm, 1, 500 ppm and fi nally 2, 000 ppm. In 5, 881 consecutively tested dermatitis patients the contact allergy rate for MI varied between 0. 5 and 6. 5 %, with a marked increase in recent years. The contact allergy rate to MI 2, 000 ppm alone, not tra ced by MCI/MI 200 ppm, varied between 0 and 1. 9 %. In conclusion, due to the increase of contact allergy to MI not traced by MCI/MI 200 ppm, MI in water at 2, 000 ppm should be tested in a baseline series. Independent of patch test technique a dose of 60 Âµg/cm 2 should not be exceeded to avoid adverse reactions and particularly patch test sensitisation.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Mortality {{following}} hospital discharge is {{an important}} and under-recognized contributor to overall child mortality in developing countries. The primary objective of this systematic review was to identify all studies reporting post-discharge mortality in children, estimate likelihood of death, and determine the most important risk factors for death. SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE and EMBASE were systematically searched using MeSH terms and keywords from the inception date to October, 2012. Key word searches using Google Scholarâ¢ and hand searching of references of retrieved articles was also performed. Studies from developing countries reporting mortality following hospital discharge among a pediatric population were considered for inclusion. RESULTS: Thirteen studies that reported mortality rates following discharge were identified. Studies varied significantly according to design, underlying characteristics of study population and duration of follow-up. Mortality rates following discharge varied significantly between studies (1 %- 18 %). When reported, post-discharge mortality rates often exceeded in-hospital mortality rates. The <b>most</b> important <b>baseline</b> <b>variables</b> associated with post-discharge mortality were young age, malnutrition, multiple previous hospitalizations, HIV infection and pneumonia. Most post-discharge deaths occurred early during the post-discharge period. Follow-up care was examined in only one study examining malaria prophylaxis in children discharged following an admission secondary to malaria, which showed no significant benefit on post-discharge mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The months following hospital discharge carry significant risk for morbidity and mortality. While several characteristics are strongly associated with post-discharge mortality, no validated tools are available to aid health workers or policy makers in the systematic identification of children {{at high risk of}} post-discharge mortality. Future research must focus on both the creation of tools to aid in defining groups of children most likely to benefit from post-discharge interventions, and formal assessment of the effectiveness of such interventions in reducing morbidity and mortality in the first few months following hospital discharge...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{compare the}} risk of {{postoperative}} ureteral stricture formation following retroperitoneal laparoscopic ureterolithotomy (RPLU) and ureteroscopy with holmium: YAG laser lithotripsy (URSL) in patients with proximal ureteral stones. Materials and Methods We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent RPLU or URSL for proximal ureteral stones between April 2011 and May 2015. Patients were allocated into URSL group or RPLU group and the outcomes were compared. Results A total of 201 patients who underwent 209 procedures including 159 URSL and 50 RPLU with a median follow-up of 30 months were included. No significant difference was observed among the two groups <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>baseline</b> parameters, while the stone size was significantly larger in the RPLU group (11. 37 Â Â±Â  2. 97 vs 14. 04 Â Â±Â  4. 38 mm, pÂ =Â  0. 000). Patients in RPLU group had markedly longer operative time (pÂ =Â  0. 000) and longer postoperative hospital stay (pÂ =Â  0. 000). The initial and one-month stone-free rates were significantly higher in the RPLU group (78. 6 % vs 100 %, pÂ =Â  0. 000 and 82. 4 % vs 100 %, pÂ =Â  0. 001, respectively). Patients in the RPLU had a higher complication rate (18. 0 % vs 9. 4 %, pÂ =Â  0. 098) and lower ureteral stricture rate (2. 5 % vs 2. 0 %, pÂ =Â  1. 000), while {{the difference was not}} significant. Further logistic regression model identified RPLU and female sex as independent risk factors for postoperative complication (Odds Ratio[OR]Â =Â  3. 57, pÂ =Â  0. 035 and ORÂ =Â  3. 57, pÂ =Â  0. 025, respectively); however, URSL was not an independent risk factor for the formation of postoperative ureteral stricture after adjusting confounding variables (ORÂ =Â  0. 90, pÂ =Â  0. 935). Conclusion RPLU and URSL have similar postoperative ureteral stricture formation risks.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{body mass}} index (BMI) across place and time to determine the pattern of BMI {{mean and standard deviation}} trajectories. We included participants in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Offspring Cohort over eight waves of follow-up, from 1971 to 2008. After exclusions, the final sample size was 4569 subjects with 28, 625 observations. We used multi-level models to examine population means and variation at the individual and neighborhood (census tracts) levels across time with measured BMI as the outcome, controlling for individual demographics and behaviors and neighborhood poverty. Because neighborhoods accounted for limited BMI variance, we removed this level as a source of variation in final models. We examined sex-stratified models with all subjects and models stratified by sex and baseline weight classification. Mean BMI increased from 24. 0 kg/m(2) at Wave 1 to 27. 7 at Wave 8 for women and from 26. 6 kg/m(2) to 29. 0 for men. In final models, BMI variation also increased from Waves 1 to 8, with the standard deviation increasing from 4. 18 kg/m(2) to 6. 15 for women and 3. 31 kg/m(2) to 4. 73 for men. BMI means increased <b>in</b> parallel across <b>most</b> <b>baseline</b> BMI weight classifications, except for more rapid increases through middle-age for obese women followed by declines in the last wave. BMI standard deviations also increased in parallel across baseline BMI classifications for women, with greater divergence of BMI variance for obese men compared to other weight classifications. Over nearly 40 years, BMI mean and variation increased <b>in</b> parallel across <b>most</b> <b>baseline</b> weight classifications <b>in</b> our sample. Individual-level characteristics, especially baseline BMI, were the primary factors in rising BMI.

Methods: We assessed patients&rsquo; clinical outcomes of HIV&ndash;HCV coinfected patients initiating antiretroviral therapy attending the Ottawa Hospital Immunodeficiency Clinic from January 1996 to June 2008. Results: We assessed 144 males and 39 females. Although similar <b>in</b> <b>most</b> <b>baseline</b> characteristics, the CD 4 count was higher in females (375 vs 290 cells/&mu;L). Fewer females initiated ritonavir-boosted regimens. The median duration on therapy before interruption or change was longer in males (10 versus 4 months) (odds ratio [OR] 1. 40 95 % confidence interval: 0. 95 &ndash; 2. 04; P = 0. 09). HIV RNA suppression was frequent (74 %) and mean CD 4 count achieved robust (over 400 cells/&mu;L) at 6 months, irrespective of sex. The primary reasons for therapy interruption in females and males included: gastrointestinal intolerance (25 % vs 19 %; P = 0. 42); poor adherence (22 % vs 15 %; P = 0. 31); neuropsychiatric symptoms (19 % vs 5 %; P = 0. 003); and lost to follow-up (3 % vs 13 %; P = 0. 08). Seven males (5 %) and no females discontinued therapy for liver-specific complications. Death rate was higher in females (23 % vs 7 %; P = 0. 003). Conclusion: There are subtle differences in the characteristics of female and male HIV&ndash;HCV coinfected patients that influence HIV treatment decisions. The reasons for treatment interruption and change differ by biological sex. This knowledge should be considered when starting HIV therapy and in efforts to improve treatment outcomes.

40|$|A recent {{paper in}} Neurology used {{statistical}} techniques {{to investigate the}} integrity of the randomization in 33 clinical trials conducted by a group of investigators. Without justification, the approach assumed {{that there would be no}} impact of correlation among <b>baseline</b> <b>variables.</b> We investigated the impact of correlation on the conclusions of the approach in several large-scale simulation studies that replicated the sample sizes and <b>baseline</b> <b>variables</b> of the clinical trials in question and utilized proper randomization.

This is also the case under no correlation, in the presence of some discrete <b>baseline</b> <b>variables,</b> with a large number of variables. Thus, statistical techniques for assessing randomization integrity should be applied with extreme caution given that very low p-values, which are taken as evidence against valid randomization, can arise even in the case of valid randomization, in the presence of correlation.

40|$|Summary. A {{prevalent}} sample {{consists of}} individuals who have experienced disease incidence but not failure event at the sampling time. We discuss methods for estimating the distribution function of a random vector defined at baseline for an incident disease population when data are collected by prevalent sampling.

Analysis of the distributions of these <b>baseline</b> <b>variables</b> showed similar proportionalities and therefore qualified the data sets for comparison of the cumulative success rates (CSR) of the implants {{on the basis of}} smoking. For the 2, 117 nonsmoking, machined-surfaced implants, the 3 -year CSR is 92. 8 %; for the 492 implants in the smoking group, the CSR is 93. 5 %. The 3 -year CSR for 1, 877 nonsmoking Osseotite implants is 98. 4 %; for the 397 smoking implants it is 98. 7 %. No difference is observed between the smoking groups and the nonsmoking groups in these patient populations. There is, however, a clinically relevant difference observed between the two implant types...|$|R

40|$|Chronic asthma is {{characterized}} by airway inflammation, mucus hypersecretion and impaired mucociliary clearance (MCC). We investigated baseline MCC and the acute effect of terbutaline in chronic asthmatics with sputum production while on long-term treatment with salmeterol in combination with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). MCC was measured at baseline {{and in response to}} 1 mg terbutaline (or placebo) on three visits over 80 min in 16 asthmatics (52 +/- 13 years of age). Subjects who had greater than 10 % absolute increase in MCC above baseline and placebo, after terbutaline, were categorized in group A and subjects who had less than 10 % in group B. In group A subjects (n = 6), MCC increased from 23. 7 +/- 4. 0 % at baseline to 43. 7 +/- 4. 9 % with terbutaline (P 0. 05). Group B subjects withdrew from all beta(2) agonists for a week and MCC was remeasured. After withdrawal, baseline MCC (7. 0 +/- 1. 8 %) was similar to the initial baseline value (P > 0. 1) and MCC with terbutaline (15. 8 +/- 4. 9 %) was greater than baseline (P < 0. 005) but remained abnormal <b>in</b> <b>most</b> subjects. <b>Baseline</b> percentage predicted FEV 1 and FEF 25 - 75 % were 77. 3 +/- 7. 2 and 41. 7 +/- 5. 6 in group A and 59. 9 +/- 8. 1 and 29. 5 +/- 8. 4 in group B subjects, respectively. MCC was impaired <b>in</b> <b>most</b> of these asthmatics with persistent airway obstruction and sputum production, despite regular treatment with ICS and salmeterol.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} corticosteroid pulse (CP) therapy on soluble interleukin 2 receptor (sIL- 2 R), interleukin 6 (IL- 6) and IL- 8 levels in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Twenty-five patients with active RA were studied before and after treatment with intravenous CP therapy. In 12 patients lymphocyte subsets were also assessed. All patients showed {{a significant decrease in}} clinical disease activity variables after 4 to 8 weeks of CP therapy. Baseline levels of sIL- 2 R were higher among patients with active RA than healthy controls; after CP therapy, sIL- 2 R levels decreased significantly, {{but not as much as}} the erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein. <b>In</b> <b>most</b> cases <b>baseline</b> levels of both IL- 6 (n = 23) and IL- 8 (n = 17) could be measured and both decreased significantly after CP therapy. Cortisol levels were suppressed shortly after CP therapy but had returned to pretreatment values at 4 weeks. After CP therapy there was a temporary increase in the number of HLA-DR positive cells and a decrease in the number of CD 3 positive cells, while the CD 4 /CD 8 ratio and IL- 2 receptor (CD 25) positive cells remained unchanged.

30|$|All {{statistical}} analyses {{were carried out}} using Stata version 12.0 software (STATA Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). Univariate {{analysis was used to}} describe socio-demographic characteristics of the study participants and summarize as percentages the study outcomes. Univariate correlation of potential prognostic factors (<b>baseline</b> <b>variables)</b> and patientsâ outcomes was also performed. The <b>baseline</b> <b>variables</b> included social demographics characteristics (age, sex, religion, level of education, marital status), and pre-existing risk factors for stroke (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, current smoking, harmful alcohol consumption, prior stroke/TIA). On examination, general assessment included temperature, pulse, cardiovascular status, blood pressure, and abdominal obesity. Neurological assessment included level of consciousness using the GCS, stroke severity at admission using the SSS and functional status using the BI. Laboratory parameters included white blood cell count, ESR, fasting blood sugar, fasting lipid profile, rapid plasma reagin, and HIV serology. Imaging procedures included non-contrast brain CT, ECG, echocardiography and carotid Doppler ultrasound for patients that had abnormal cardiovascular examination.|$|R
40|$|Adaptive {{enrichment}} designs involve {{rules for}} restricting enrollment to {{a subset of}} the population during the course of an ongoing trial. This can be used to target those who benefit from the experimental treatment. To leverage prognostic information in <b>baseline</b> <b>variables</b> and short-term outcomes, we use a semiparametric, locally efficient estimator, and investigate its strengths and limitations compared to standard estimators. Through simulation studies, we assess how sensitive the trial performance (Type I error, power, expected sample size, trial duration) is to different design characteristics. Our simulation distributions mimic features of data from the Alzheimerâs Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, and involve two subpopulations of interest based on a generic marker. We investigate the impact of the following design characteristics: the accrual rate, the delay time between enrollment and observation of the primary outcome, and the prognostic value of <b>baseline</b> <b>variables</b> and short-term outcomes. We apply information-based monitoring, and evaluate how accurately information can be estimated in an ongoing trial...|$|R

40|$|In {{randomized}} {{clinical trials}} with <b>baseline</b> <b>variables</b> that are prognostic {{for the primary}} outcome, there is potential to improve precision and reduce sample size by appropriately adjusting for these variables. A major challenge {{is that there are}} multiple statistical methods to adjust for <b>baseline</b> <b>variables,</b> but little guidance on which is best to use in a given context. The choice of method can have important consequences. For example, one commonly used method leads to uninterpretable estimates if there is any treatment effect heterogeneity, which would jeopardize the validity of trial conclusions. We give practical guidance on how to avoid this problem, while retaining the advantages of covariate adjustment. This can be achieved by using simple (but less well-known) standardization methods from the recent statistics literature. We discuss these methods and give software in R and Stata implementing them. A data example from a recent stroke trial is used to illustrate these methods...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{estimator}} of the restricted mean survival time in randomized trials {{where there is}} right censoring that may depend on treatment and <b>baseline</b> <b>variables.</b> The proposed estimator leverages prognostic <b>baseline</b> <b>variables</b> to obtain equal or better asymptotic precision compared to traditional estimators. Under regularity conditions and random censoring within strata of treatment and <b>baseline</b> <b>variables,</b> the proposed estimator has the following features: (i) it is interpretable under violations of the proportional hazards assumption; (ii) it is consistent and at least as precise as the Kaplan-Meier estimator under independent censoring; (iii) it remains consistent under violations of independent censoring (unlike the Kaplan-Meier estimator) when either the censoring or survival distributions are estimated consistently; and (iv) it achieves the nonparametric efficiency bound when both of these distributions are consistently estimated. We illustrate the performance of our method using simulations based on resampling data from a completed, phase 3 randomized clinical trial of a new surgical treatment for stroke; the proposed estimator achieves a 12 % gain in relative efficiency compared to the Kaplan-Meier estimator. The proposed estimator has potential advantages over existing approaches for randomized trials with time-to-event outcomes, since existing methods either rely on model assumptions that are untenable in many applications, or lack some of the efficiency and consistency properties (i) -(iv). We focus on estimation of the restricted mean survival time, but our methods may be adapted to estimate any treatment effect measure defined as a smooth contrast between the survival curves for each study arm. We provide R code to implement the estimator...|$|R
