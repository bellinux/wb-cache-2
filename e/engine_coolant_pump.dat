40|$|In the future, new {{challenges}} will occur during the product {{development in the}} vehicular industry when emission legislations getting tighter. This will also affect the truck cooling system and therefore increase needs for analysing the system {{at different levels of}} the product development. Volvo 3 P wishes for these reasons to examine the possibility to use AMESim as a future 1 D analysis tool. This tool {{can be used as a}} complement to existing analysis methods at Volvo 3 P. It should be possible to simulate pressure, flow and heat transfer both steady state and transient. In this thesis work a cooling system of a FH 31 MD 13 520 hp truck with an <b>engine</b> driven <b>coolant</b> <b>pump</b> is studied. Further a model of the cooling system is built in AMESim together with necessary auxiliary system such as oil circuits. The model is validated using experimental data that have been produced by Volvo 3 P at the Gothenburg facility. The results from validation and other simulations show that the model gives a good picture of the cooling system. It also gives information about pressure, flow and heat transfer in steady state conditions. Further a design modification is done, showing how a change affects the flow in the cooling system. The conclusion is that a truck cooling system can be built and simulated in AMESim. Further, it shows that AMESim meets the requirements Volvo 3 P in Gothenburg has set up for the future 1 D analysis tool and thereby AMESim is a good complement to the already existing analysis method...|$|R

40|$|A canned nuclear <b>coolant</b> <b>pump</b> {{is used in}} an {{advanced}} third-generation pressurized water reactor. Impeller is {{a key component of}} a canned nuclear <b>coolant</b> <b>pump.</b> Usually, the blade is installed between the hub and the shroud as an entire part. The blade is divided into two parts and is staggered in the circumferential direction is an approach of blade design. To understand the effects of staggered blades on a canned nuclear <b>coolant</b> <b>pump,</b> this article numerically investigated different types of staggering. The validity of the numerical simulation was confirmed by comparing the numerical and experimental results. The performance change of a canned nuclear <b>coolant</b> <b>pump</b> with staggered blades was acquired. Hydraulic performance curves, axial force curves, static pressure distributions at the impeller outlet, and static pressure pulsations were performed to investigate the performance changes caused by the staggered blades. The results show that the staggered blade has an important influence on the performance of canned nuclear <b>coolant</b> <b>pumps.</b> A staggered blade does not improve hydraulic performance but does improve the axial force and pressure pulsation. Specifically, the staggered blades can significantly reduce the pressure pulsation amplitude on the impeller pass frequency...|$|R

50|$|An {{engineering}} {{option was}} designed to {{reduce the power loss}} due to engine radiator fan operation and to increase the heat available for heating of the passengers. After experiments by Wing-Commander T.R. Cave-Browne-Cave (CBC), Professor of Engineering at Southampton University, a satisfactory design was produced. The 'CBC' system involved two small engine radiators being placed above the driver's cab roof level at the front outer corners of the double deck to give maximum aerodynamic air flow. The <b>engine</b> <b>coolant</b> water was <b>pumped</b> around these instead of the traditional radiator. In cold weather, all or a portion of the air passing through these radiators, was diverted by flaps, the left into the upper saloon and the right to the lower deck. In hot weather, the flaps could be changed by push-pull levers in the driver's cab roof to divert all the hot air to the outside of the vehicle. The movement of the vehicle was (usually) adequate to cool the engine without the need for a fan or radiator at the traditional position in front of the engine. The traditional 'radiator' grille {{at the front of the}} vehicle was not required, but was usually retained (with a few exceptions) and blanked off behind. 'Varivane' wax capsule operated shutters were fitted in front of the upper radiators to keep the coolant at optimum temperature. There were some disadvantages to the scheme and eventually customers stopped specifying it.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Adjusting {{operating}} {{temperature of the}} engine in the steady state and during warm-up improves fuel consumption and reduces engine emission through higher {{operating temperature}}s.

Thermal fluid analysis by 1 -D simulation is an effective tool for studying {{the control of the}} entire cooling system and optimization of engine performance by using active control thermal management systems which allow high tolerance for coolant temperature across speed-load map of the engine. In this work a 1 -D simulation model (GT-SUITE) was used to evaluate the effect of warm-up improvement on powertrain performance by using electric <b>coolant</b> <b>pumps</b> and fans, electronic control valve, and an electronic control system with PID feedback. Firstly, the cooling system model was validated with experimental data, and then replaced with an advanced thermal management system.

40|$|Many {{cases of}} high {{vibration}} and changing vibration in reactor <b>coolant</b> <b>pumps</b> (RCPs) {{can be traced}} to one of several types of degradation in the lower motor guide bearing. This paper presents a comparison of the vibrational characteristics for several failure modes. Included in this list are loss of lubricant, bearing overloading, and time-varying shoe clearance. Each of the examples studied is from an actual pump which underwent a lower guide bearing failure. In each case the pump was operated for an extended period following the onset of the failure mechanism. This type of operation raises the question of its effect on the fatigue life of the pump shaft and other components. This paper provides a simple assessment {{of the extent to which}} fatigue life is impacted. I. Background I. 1 Design Considerations Experience has shown that one of the most common failures in nuclear main <b>coolant</b> <b>pumps</b> involves the lower motor bearing. Typically, the lower guide bearing is an oil-immersed, segmented shoe bearing. Figure 1 shows the arrangement for a typical Westinghouse, or similarly designed, reactor <b>coolant</b> <b>pump.</b> There are several reasons for the frequency of these failures compared to failures in the other bearings. Collectively, the reasons may be summarized in that main <b>coolant</b> <b>pumps</b> are three-bearing machines, wherein the lower guide bearing has the weakest design of the three. Therefore, under conditions such as misalignment where all the bearings have higherthan-normal loads, it is the lower motor bearing that is most likely to fail...|$|R
