500|$|In September {{the ship}} participated in Operation Zitronella, {{ferrying}} {{troops of the}} 349th Grenadier Regiment to destroy Norwegian facilities {{on the island of}} Spitzbergen, together with the battleships [...] and Scharnhorst, escorted by eight other destroyers. After unloading her troops, she bombarded targets on the island until her <b>fire</b> <b>main</b> broke from the shock of shooting and partially flooded one of her compartments. While successful, the operation was primarily intended to boost the morale of the ships stationed in the Arctic when fuel shortages limited their activities and the Allies reestablished the bases five weeks later. Steinbrinck and two other destroyers escorted the pocket battleship [...] back to Germany in September and returned to Narvik. On 25 November she was ordered to return to Germany for an , but accidentally collided with a small Norwegian steamer en route later that night. The collision severely damaged her bow and she had to sail slowly to Trondheim for emergency repairs lest the forward bulkhead collapse. The ship then received temporary repairs in Oslo before departing for Germany on 18 December.|$|E
2500|$|While {{awaiting}} repairs, Noshiro Maru {{was caught}} in Manila Bay by a Task Force 38 air strike on 21 September 1944 and hit by three bombs that afternoon. The first hit the starboard side near the bridge, the second exploded in the radio room, and the third caused an engine room fire. Without engine room power for <b>fire</b> <b>main</b> pressure, the fire spread through the evening causing an ammunition explosion killing three soldiers and six crewmen. Noshiro Maru drifted aground on 24 September at [...] and remained derelict when the United States captured the Philippines.|$|E

A further tank is above the East lift roof serving only level 12 by gravity (retrofitted {{at the time the}} building opened to solve low water pressure in the penthouse flats). Each flat has two water isolation valves within kitchen and bathroom riser shafts. Vertical risers can be isolated at roof level. Hot water is via water heater (originally gas fired instantaneous) in kitchen with flue in façade. Hot water piping to bathroom is cast within the concrete floor slab from the kitchen.

50|$|A fourth attempt {{using a small}} {{explosive}} charge detonated the bomb, killing Staff Sergeant James Prescott instantly and severely injuring Warrant Officer Phillips, the other member of the bomb disposal team. The ship was torn open from waterline to funnel, with the blast starting major fires in both engine rooms, which spread very quickly. The starboard <b>fire</b> <b>main</b> was fractured, the ship lost all electrical power, and the commanding officer, Commander Nick Tobin, gave the order to abandon ship. Tobin {{was the last person}} to leave the ship; about five minutes after his departure, the missile magazines began exploding.|$|E

50|$|The {{intentional}} ignition {{of fires}} {{is a common}} firefighting tactic. A burnout (also called a firing operation, or firing out) is a smaller fire ignited along a control line ahead of the <b>main</b> <b>fire.</b> The intent is to consume fuel ahead of the <b>main</b> <b>fire,</b> strengthening the control line.

50|$|The Exocet {{that struck}} the Sheffield {{impacted}} on {{the starboard side}} at deck level 2, travelling through the junior ratings scullery and breaching the Forward Auxiliary Machinery Room/Forward Engine Room bulkhead 2.4 m above the waterline, creating {{a hole in the}} hull roughly 1.2 by 3 m. It appears that the warhead did not explode. Accounts suggest that the initial impact of the missile disabled the ship's electrical distribution systems and breached the pressurised sea water <b>fire</b> <b>main,</b> severely hampering any firefighting response and eventually dooming the ship to be consumed by the fire. The loss of Sheffield was a deep shock to the British public and government.|$|E
50|$|Mauritius was {{completed}} with an internal degaussing system which induced severe corrosion to the ship's <b>fire</b> <b>main</b> (made of copper); this major defect, which rendered her unfit for action, required refits, first at Simonstown, later at Singapore, and finally at Plymouth.The future Admiral of the Fleet Henry Leach {{served as a}} midshipman aboard Mauritius during this time.She joined the Eastern Fleet in 1942, but was withdrawn in April 1943 to reinforce the Mediterranean Fleet. After repairs following grounding, she was operational in June 1943 and thereafter participated in the landings in Sicily, (Operation Husky), in July as a unit of Support Force East, when she carried out shore bombardment duties.|$|E
50|$|Ommaney Bay left on New Year's Day 1945 and transited Surigao Strait {{two days}} later. The next afternoon, {{while in the}} Sulu Sea, a {{twin-engine}} Japanese suicide plane penetrated the screen undetected and made for Ommaney Bay. The plane nicked her island then crashed into her flight deck on the forward starboard side. Two bombs were released; one of them penetrated the flight deck and detonated below, setting off a series of explosions among the fully gassed planes on the forward third of the hangar deck. The second bomb passed through the hangar deck, ruptured the <b>fire</b> <b>main</b> on the second deck, and exploded near the starboard side.|$|E
