You've got to be right or wrong. I love the satisfaction when you are right — and the agony when you are wrong." [...] Hochuli finds similarities between the football field and courtroom saying, [...] "On the football field, people like that I'm in charge and know what I'm doing, {{but a lot of the}} time, it's just appearance. [...] I'm going to sell you on my decision. It's the same in the courtroom. You don't stand in front of a jury and say, 'I think my client is innocent.' You say, 'We're right!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Of all the characters, Hamlet has the {{greatest}} rhetorical skill. He uses highly developed metaphors, stichomythia, and in nine memorable words deploys both anaphora and asyndeton: [...] "to die: to sleep—/ To sleep, perchance to dream". In contrast, when occasion demands, he is precise and straightforward, as when he explains his inward emotion to his mother: [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> within which passes show,/ These but the trappings and the suits of woe". At times, he relies heavily on puns to express his true thoughts while simultaneously concealing them. His [...] "nunnery" [...] remarks to Ophelia are {{an example of a}} cruel double meaning as nunnery was Elizabethan slang for brothel. His very first words in the play are a pun; when Claudius addresses him as [...] "my cousin Hamlet, and my son", Hamlet says as an aside: [...] "A little more than kin, and less than kind." ...|$|E

500|$|Against all expectations, the war {{continued}} for five years. During this period, PedroII's {{time and energy}} were devoted to the war effort. He tirelessly worked to raise and equip troops to reinforce the front lines and to push forward the fitting of new warships for the navy. The rape of women, widespread violence against civilians, ransacking and destruction of properties that had occurred during Paraguay's invasion of Brazilian territory had made a deep impression on him. He warned the Countess of Barral in November 1866 that [...] "the war should be concluded as honor demands, cost what it cost." [...] "Difficulties, setbacks, and war-weariness {{had no effect on}} his quiet resolve", said Barman. Mounting casualties did not distract him from advancing what he saw as Brazil's righteous cause, and he stood prepared to personally sacrifice his own throne to gain an honorable outcome. Writing in his journal a few years previously PedroII remarked: [...] "What sort of fear could <b>I</b> <b>have?</b> <b>That</b> they take the government from me? Many better kings than I have lost it, and to me it is no more than the weight of a cross which it is my duty to carry." ...|$|E
500|$|When Tom is {{introduced}} in the first season finale, he wears a fake beard and old clothes. He continues to appear under this guise throughout the second season, only revealing his beard to be fake in the finale. M. C. Gainey, the actor who portrays Tom, was only informed that his character's beard was fake {{near the end of}} season two. The producers describe Tom as [...] "friendly", earning him the nickname [...] "Mr. Friendly". One critic has described him as [...] "sarcastic" [...] and [...] "bright". Tom's dislike of blood causes him to struggle while supervising Ben's operation, which Emerson believes makes him [...] "cuddly". Gainey does not think he is very similar to Tom, commenting, [...] "He seems to be very loyal and I'm a very loyal person so <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> in common, but other than that, I don't really know what he's about. He seems much more socially awkward than I am." [...] After Tom was revealed to be gay during season four, M. C. Gainey stated that [...] "anytime you've got a group of people, somebody's got to be marching to a different drummer- that would be Tom Friendly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stone grew up {{listening}} {{to a wide variety of}} music including 1960s and 1970s American R and soul music performed by such artists as Dusty Springfield and Aretha Franklin. As a result, she developed a soulful style of singing like her idols. [...] "My first CD that I owned was Aretha Franklin: Greatest Hits. And I saw the advert on TV and it was just like little clips of her songs. I had no idea who she was—I was only like 10 so. I said, 'Oh yeah, that looks really good', so I wrote it down and I said to my mum, 'Can <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> for Christmas?' So she told my friend Dennis, who always gets me good music anyway, and he got that for me. So that was one of my first albums that I loved." [...] She would later tell MTV News: [...] "I kind of clicked into soul music more than anything else because of the vocals. You've got to have good vocals to sing soul music and I always liked it ever since I was little." ...|$|E

2500|$|Much of the play's {{language}} {{is in the}} elaborate, witty language expected of a royal court. This {{is in line with}} Baldassare Castiglione's work, The Courtier (published in 1528), which outlines several courtly rules, specifically advising servants of royals to amuse their rulers with their inventive language. Osric and Polonius seem to especially respect this suggestion. Claudius' speech is full of rhetorical figures, as is Hamlet's and, at times, Ophelia's, while Horatio, the guards, and the gravediggers use simpler methods of speech. Claudius demonstrates an authoritative control over the language of a King, referring to himself in the first person plural, and using anaphora mixed with metaphor that hearkens back to Greek political speeches. Hamlet seems the most educated in rhetoric of all the characters, using anaphora, as the king does, but also asyndeton and highly developed metaphors, {{while at the same time}} managing to be precise and unflowery (as when he explains his inward emotion to his mother, saying [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>that</b> within which passes show, / These but the trappings and the suits of woe."). His {{language is}} very self-conscious, and relies heavily on puns. Especially when pretending to be mad, Hamlet uses puns to reveal his true thoughts, while at the same time hiding them. Psychologists have since associated a heavy use of puns with schizophrenia.|$|E
