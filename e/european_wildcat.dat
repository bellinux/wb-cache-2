5|$|The felids are {{a rapidly}} {{evolving}} family of mammals that {{share a common}} ancestor only 10–15million years ago and include lions, tigers, cougars and many others. Within this family, domestic cats (Felis catus) {{are part of the}} genus Felis, which is a group of small cats containing about seven species (depending upon classification scheme). Members of the genus are found worldwide and include the jungle cat (Felis chaus) of southeast Asia, <b>European</b> <b>wildcat</b> (F. silvestris silvestris), African wildcat (F. s. lybica), the Chinese mountain cat (F. bieti), and the Arabian sand cat (F. margarita), among others.|$|E
5|$|The last {{confirmed}} {{death of}} an Anatolian leopard, {{closely related to the}} Persian (Caucasian) leopard and native to the western regions of Anatolia, took place in the Bağözü village of the Beypazarı district in Ankara Province on 17 January 1974. The Persian (Caucasian) leopard is still found in very small numbers in the northeastern and southeastern regions of Turkey. The Caspian tiger is an extinct tiger subspecies (closely related to the Siberian tiger) which lived in the easternmost regions of Turkey until {{the latter half of the}} 20th century, with the last confirmed death in Uludere, February 1970. The Eurasian lynx and the <b>European</b> <b>wildcat</b> are other felid species which are currently found in the forests of Turkey.|$|E
25|$|The wildcat shows a {{high degree}} of {{geographic}} variation. Whereas the Asiatic wildcat is spotted, the African wildcat is faintly striped, has short sandy-gray fur, banded legs, red-backed ears and a tapering tail. The <b>European</b> <b>wildcat</b> is striped, has long fur and a bushy tail with a rounded tip, and is larger than a domestic cat.|$|E

Since then there were frequent, but unconfirmed sightings in this province until December 2012 when a cat was photographed again. A male wildcat was photographed several times in April 2013 while it was scavenging the carcass of a dead deer, an unusual behavior for a wildcat.|$|E
25|$|In 1778, Johann von Schreber {{described}} the <b>European</b> <b>wildcat</b> using the scientific name Felis (catus) silvestris. In subsequent decades, several naturalists and explorers described wildcats from European, African and Asian countries. The taxonomist Pocock reviewed wildcat skins {{collected in the}} British Museum, and in 1951 designated three Felis bieti subspecies from Eastern Asia, seven Felis silvestris subspecies from Europe to Asia Minor, and 25 Felis lybica subspecies from Africa, and West to Central Asia.|$|E
25|$|The Scottish wildcat (Felis silvestris grampia), or Highlands tiger, {{is a dark}} colored {{subspecies}} of the <b>European</b> <b>wildcat</b> {{native to}} Scotland. Its range previously also included England and Wales, but it became extinct in these areas, {{as well as in}} southern Scotland, within the last 150 years. Extant numbers are estimated at between 400 and 4000. The Scottish wildcat population is threatened primarily by interbreeding with domestic cats. It is the only wild feline left on the island of Great Britain.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{thousands}} of years of domestication, there is very little difference between the housecat and its wild ancestor, as its breeding has been more subject to natural selection imposed by its environment, rather than artificial selection by humans. The wildcat subspecies that gave rise to the housecat is most likely the African wildcat, based on genetics, morphology, and behaviour. The African wildcat lacks the sharply defined dorsal stripe present in the <b>European</b> <b>wildcat,</b> a trait which corresponds with the coat patterns found in striped tabbies. Also, like the African wildcat, the housecat's tail is usually thin, rather than thick and bushy like the European wildcat's. In contrast to European wildcats, which are notoriously difficult to tame, hand-reared African wildcats behave almost exactly like domestic tabbies, but are more intolerant of other cats, and almost invariably drive away their siblings, mates, and grown kittens. Further evidence of an African origin for the housecat is present in the African wildcat's growth; like housecat kittens, African wildcat kittens undergo rapid physical development during {{the first two weeks of}} life. In contrast, <b>European</b> <b>wildcat</b> kittens develop much more slowly. The bacula of European domestic cats bear closer resemblance to those of local, rather than African wildcats, thus indicating that crossbreeding between housecats and wildcats of European origin has been extensive.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>European</b> <b>wildcat</b> (F. s. silvestris) {{was once}} very widely {{distributed}} in Europe and absent only in Fennoscandia and Estonia.

In the Pyrenees, it occurs from sea level to [...] It is possible that in some areas, including Scotland and Stromberg, Germany, pure wildcats have crossbred extensively with domestic cats. The only islands in the Mediterranean with native populations of wildcats are Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica and possibly Crete, where wildcats likely descended from feral populations introduced in Neolithic times. It is possibly extinct in the Czech Republic, and considered regionally extinct in Austria, though vagrants from Italy are spreading into Austrian territory.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{focus on}} infections in domestic cats (Felis catus) has {{raised questions about}} lungworm distribution in wild hosts. To enhance knowledge of the occurrence of lungworms in enzootic regions of central Italy, we examined the carcasses of 16 <b>European</b> <b>wildcats</b> (Felis silvestris silvestris). Adult nematodes, feces, respiratory flushings, and pulmonary tissues were collected at necropsy and then microscopically and genetically analyzed. Fourteen wildcats had single or mixed lungworm species. Aelurostrongylus abstrusus {{was the most common}} parasite retrieved, followed by Troglostrongylus brevior. In addition, three specimens of Angiostrongylus chabaudi were found in the pulmonary arteries of one wildcat. Histologically, the most common lesions were a mild-to-severe chronic catarrhal bronchitis and a chronic interstitial pneumonia with smooth muscle hypertrophy, associated with T. brevior and A. abstrusus, respectively. These results demonstrate that the <b>European</b> <b>wildcats</b> may harbor several species of lungworms that may impair their health and welfare. Also, F. s. silvestris is a potential reservoir for respiratory nematodes in domestic cats...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{evidence}} that Mediterranean Europe offers suitable conditions for the biology of felid respiratory metastrongyloids, no updated data {{on the presence of}} felid lungworms are available for Greece. Although the cat lungworm Aelurostrongylus abstrusus is considered as enzootic in domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus) living in some areas of continental Greece, conversely, Troglostrongylus brevior, has only been reported in the island of Crete. The present study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of Aelurostrongylus abstrusus and Troglostrongylus brevior in domestic cats from four different Greek locations including islands where <b>European</b> <b>wildcats</b> (Felis silvestris silvestris), believed to be the natural reservoir of T. brevior, are considered absent...|$|R
50|$|In most <b>European</b> countries, <b>European</b> <b>wildcats</b> {{have become}} rare. Although legally protected, {{they are still}} shot by people mistaking them for feral cats. In the Scottish Highlands, where {{approximately}} 400 were thought {{to remain in the}} wild in 2004, interbreeding with feral cats is a significant threat to the wild population's distinctiveness. The greatest population of wildcats lives in Spain and Portugal but is threatened by interbreeding with feral cats and loss of habitat. In the 1990s, the easternmost population in Ukraine, Moldova, and the Caucasus was threatened by destruction of broad-leaved forests, entailing a reduction of their range. Only small numbers occur in protected areas.|$|R

The taillessness arose as a natural mutation on the island, though folklore persists that tailless domestic cats were brought there by sea. They are descended from mainland stock of obscure origin. Like all house cats, including nearby British and Irish populations, they are ultimately descended from the African wildcat (F. silvestris lybica) and not from native <b>European</b> <b>wildcats</b> (F. s. silvestris), of which the island has long been devoid.|$|R

40|$|Introgression {{can be an}} {{important}} evolutionary force but it can also lead to species extinction and as such is a crucial issue for species conservation. However, introgression is difficult to detect, morphologically as well as genetically. Hybridization with domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus) is a major concern for the conservation of <b>European</b> <b>wildcats</b> (Felis s. silvestris). The available morphologic and genetic markers for the two Felis subspecies are not sufficient to reliably detect hybrids beyond first generation. Here we present a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based approach that allows the identification of introgressed individuals. Using high-throughput sequencing of reduced representation libraries we developed a diagnostic marker set containing 48 SNPs (Fst > 0. 8) which allows the identification of wildcats, domestic cats, their hybrids and backcrosses. This allows assessing introgression rate in natural wildcat populations and is key for a better understanding of hybridization processes...|$|R
