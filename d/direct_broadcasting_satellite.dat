40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of the <b>Direct</b> <b>Broadcasting</b> <b>Satellite</b> in Japan under its Kodo Johoka Shakai (Highly Advanced Information Society) policy. The field of new media policies is relatively new but very important in communications studies. The development of new media technologies changes into existing media systems, and profoundly influences economies which are increasingly dependent upon information services. Japan's case is particularly interesting. Relatively little is known about its DBS policy compared to other industrialized countries, even though Japan has already begun to operate DBS under its own version of the "information society", the Kodo Johoka Shakai (Highly Advanced Information Society). The formulation of DBS policy is related to many factors, including space development, research and development, broadcasting, international telecommunications regulations and economic competition both in international and domestic markets. In order to take these factors into consideration, an historical approach and institutional analysis are used in this thesis...|$|E

40|$|This work {{examines}} {{the effect of}} three emerging satellite technologies on the use and regulation {{of what might be}} called Earth Orbital Space. The three new technologies, <b>Direct</b> <b>Broadcasting</b> <b>Satellites</b> (DBS), Global Mobile Personal Communication Services (GMPCS), and Global Navigation Satellite Services (GNSS), are being implemented in or planned for different portions of Earth Orbital Space: the geostationary orbit, low earth orbits, and medium earth orbits, respectively. Each technology creates different challenges for the International Telecommunication Union which is the organization charged with their regulation. DBS services were regulated in the 1970 s and early 1980 s prior to their practical use. That early regulation appears, today, to be overly restrictive in many ways. GMPCS, on the other hand, is now becoming a reality but lacks a solid legal structure to ensure that its potential for global wireless communication can be achieved. GNSS provides yet a different challenge: that of providing for the civil utilization of military navigation systems. The deployment of these new technologies add to the increasing problem of congestion in the orbit-spectrum resource. The final chapter details a number of different proposals aimed at increasing both equity and efficiency in the management of the orbit-spectrum resource...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The InGaPIInGaAs {{single and}} double delta-doped pseudomorphic high {{electron}} mobility transistor (6 -PHEMT) grown by low-pressure metal organic {{chemical vapor deposition}} (LP-MOCVD) have been fabricated and investigated. Based on the employment of the wide-gap InGaP Schottky layer and delta-doped carrier supplier, the high breakdown voltages together with good device characteristics are obtained simultaneously. Furthermore, the newly designed V-shaped InGaAs channel can enhance the carrier confinement effect and increase the product of carrier concentration and mobility. Experimentally, for 1 x 100 pmZ devices, the gate-to-drain breakdown volt-ges larger than 40 (30) V, the transconductances of 90 (201) mS/mm, and the maximum current densities of 646 (846) mA/mm are achieved for the studied single and double 6 -PHEMT, respectively. Meanwhile, the measuredf, andf,, are 12 (16) GHz and 28. 4 (34) GHz, respectively.

40|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>broadcasting</b> <b>{{satellite}}</b> {{has become}} a vital system in satellite communication globally especially for digital broadcasting purposes. Currently, a parabolic antenna is normally used for this application, however the advantages of reflectarray which is flat in shape and possibility for beam steering capability make the reflectarray antenna {{is one of the}} interesting topic to be studied. At the current time, many reflectarrays are based on microstrip technology. Nevertheless, at high frequency the conductor loss is high and the antenna efficiency will be reduced. An interesting solution is to use dielectric resonator antennas (DRAs) as the reflectarray elements. In facts, DRA can give low loss and high bandwidth. In this thesis, firstly four different slots with alphabets underneath the rectangular DRA have been investigated as unit-cell for reflectarray. A new structure of rectangular DRA with C-shaped slot unit-cell has been proposed which can give high phase range (321. 9 o) and low loss (0. 3685 o). This structure is then being validated experimentally in Ku-Band. Next, the mutual coupling effects between unit-cell in the reflectarray are studied and a simulation technique based on Finite Different Time Domain (FDTD) is proposed. By doing so, this simulation technique is most suitable to predict the actual reflectarray radiation pattern. Finally, the reflectarray antenna composed of 24 x 24 unit-cells based on DRA with C-shaped slot is proposed at 12 GHz...|$|E
40|$|The new {{communication}} technology {{and its implications}} on national and international relations {{has been one of}} the key debates during the last two decades. This received a new impetus with the emergence of <b>Direct</b> <b>Broadcasting</b> <b>Satellite</b> (DBS) together with the convergence of electronic information processing, data bank and telecommunication networks in a single system known as telematic. The DBS system has received increasing attention since it offers a wide range of choice to people. However, in many countries it is also suspected of ravaging culture and sovereignty, while undermining national broadcasting. This sentiment is not shared by all societies and governments, since some believe it has also enhanced freedom and democracy.;The penetration of DBS in Iran began since 1993, when people in the capital and other major cities began to receive images transmitted by dozens of foreign broadcasters. Within a short period of time, satellite became one of the most focal points of interest of the Iranian people and continued alongside the installation of satellite dishes. In April 1994, the state fired the first volley as a warning to the viewers and demonstrated that the period of tolerance was over. This reaction deeply involved government, Majles (Parliament), press and people in an intensive course of satellite discourse followed by fuqaha (pl. Faqih - jurisconsultant in Islamic law) intervention. Here, each group of participants branched out and took different stances; some appeared in favour, while others stood against foreign satellites. Accordingly, the Islamic Republic of Iran passed a bill which prohibited the reception of satellite signals. However, at the same time it put forward a project for developing national radio and television.;In this study, the introduction, penetration and the impact of DBS on the Iranian media sphere, particularly on the broadcasting system, within the context of globalisation, will be discussed. It will also focus on the responses of the Islamic Republic to DBS, by looking at their perspectives and the measures they have taken since the popularisation of DBS in Iran from 1993 until 1997...|$|E
