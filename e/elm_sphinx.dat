50|$|Larvae {{come in two}} {{different}} color phases; a green phase, and a dark phase which differs in shades of brown, orange, and somewhat of a pinkish brown. Larvae complete all five instars within approximately one month. The first instar is the same shade of green as its egg. As the larva progresses through its instars, change in structure is noticeable. The caterpillar sports four, long, horn-like projections- {{in addition to the}} tail horn- from above its head, which is why the <b>Elm</b> <b>Sphinx</b> is sometimes called the Four-horned Sphinx.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Elm</b> <b>sphinx,</b> (Ceratomia amyntor), {{sometimes}} called the Four-horned Sphinx, is a North American species of moth in the Sphingidae family. It has a wingspan of 3¼ - 4½ inches (8.2 - 11.5 cm). As the name suggests, the larvae (caterpillars) feed on elm trees (Ulmus), {{but they can also}} be found feeding on birch (Betula), basswood (Tilia), and cherry (Prunus). When the caterpillars are ready, they crawl {{to the bottom of the}} host tree, where they crawl underneath the soil and pupate and may overwinter underground if late enough into the year. Vegetable growers should be aware of this larvae due to its insatiable appetite. One of these larvae are capable in devouring huge amounts of plant's foliage and even succulent stems.|$|E
50|$|The overall {{coloring}} of the imago, or adult, <b>Elm</b> <b>Sphinx</b> is a gray-brown with wavy markings {{covering the}} forewings. In the upper {{center of the}} forewings, as with other Ceratomia species, {{there is a small}} white dot. The hindwings are a plain gray with a darker band running the length of the near-edge. The outer ends of the forewings and hindwings are both dashed with a light-dark-light pattern. Three broken, dark bands run the length of the body from the thorax to the tip of the abdomen. The antennae are stiff and wiry and have hook at the tips. Some specimens have a prominent splash of bright white on their upper head and wings and stand out considerably from other C. amyntor.|$|E
