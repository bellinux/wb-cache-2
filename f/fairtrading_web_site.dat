40|$|<b>Web</b> <b>sites</b> are {{important}} components of Internet strategy for organizations. This paper develops a theoretical model {{for understanding the}} effect of <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> design elements on customer loyalty to a <b>Web</b> <b>site.</b> We show {{the relevance of the}} business domain of a <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> to gain a contextual understanding of relative importance of <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> design elements. We use a hierarchical linear modeling approach to model multilevel and cross-level interactions that have not been explicitly considered in previous research. By analyzing data on more than 12, 000 online customer surveys for 43 <b>Web</b> <b>sites</b> in several business domains, we find that the relative importance of different <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> features (e. g., content, functionality) in affecting customer loyalty to a <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> varies depending on the <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> 2 ̆ 7 s domain. For example, we find that the relationship between <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> content and customer loyalty is stronger for information-oriented <b>Web</b> <b>sites</b> than for transaction-oriented <b>Web</b> <b>sites.</b> However, the relationship between functionality and customer loyalty is stronger for transaction-oriented <b>Web</b> <b>sites</b> than for information-oriented <b>Web</b> <b>sites.</b> We also find that government <b>Web</b> <b>sites</b> enjoy greater word-of-mouth effect than commercial <b>Web</b> <b>sites.</b> Finally, transaction-oriented <b>Web</b> <b>sites</b> tend to score higher on mean customer loyalty than do information-oriented <b>Web</b> <b>sites...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} determinants {{and role of}} consumer trust in e-business. It examines consumer perceptions of trust in a <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> and addresses the following key research questions: What factors influence consumer trust in a <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> and what specific <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> trust cues are associated with these factors? How does trust affect consumer behavioral intent on a <b>Web</b> <b>site?</b> To address these questions, we develop a conceptual model that links consumer perceptions of <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> characteristics, consumer characteristics and demographics to perceptions of trust in a <b>Web</b> <b>site,</b> and trust to behavioral intent related to a <b>Web</b> <b>site.</b> We also examine whether trust mediates the relationship between <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> and consumer characteristics and behavioral intent related to the <b>Web</b> <b>site.</b> We test our hypotheses in a large-scale empirical study that estimates this model from 6831 consumers across 25 <b>Web</b> <b>sites</b> and eight industry categories. We validate the model using a holdout sample. The results show that <b>Web</b> <b>site,</b> consumer, category and demographic variables can explain 76 % {{of the variance in}} trust. <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> characteristics such as privacy and security, navigation, presentation, brand, and advice account for as much as 98 % of this explained variance in <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> trust.

40|$|Abstract. The term World Wide Web (WWW) {{emphasizes}} that the Web is global and many companies realize that this creates new opportunities. A considerable amount of literature on <b>web</b> <b>site</b> development stresses that, {{in order to attract}} and retain more customers, it is vital to create different versions of a <b>web</b> <b>site</b> and adapt those versions to the local communities they target. This process is usually called globalization and the different <b>web</b> <b>site</b> versions are called localized <b>web</b> <b>sites.</b> Although content management systems (CMS) for <b>web</b> <b>sites</b> provide support for multinational <b>web</b> <b>sites,</b> current <b>web</b> <b>site</b> design methodologies do not consider the issue of globalization. In general, the globalization effort is done after the <b>web</b> <b>site</b> is designed and implemented. This makes globalization much harder. In this paper, we show how to extend an existing <b>web</b> <b>site</b> design method, WSDM, to support the design of localized <b>web</b> <b>sites.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Web</b> <b>site</b> {{usability}} {{is concerned}} with how easy and intuitive it is for individuals to learn to use and interact with a <b>Web</b> <b>site.</b> It {{is a measure of}} the quality of a <b>Web</b> <b>site’s</b> presence, as perceived by users. The usability of <b>Web</b> <b>sites</b> is important, because high usability is associated with a positive attitude toward the <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> and results in higher online transactions. Poorly designed <b>Web</b> <b>sites</b> with low usability, on the other hand, lead to negative financial impacts. Existing approaches to <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> usability include measurement and tracking of parameters, such as response time and task completion time, and software engineering approaches that specify general usability guidelines and common practices during software development. This paper analyzes usability from the point of view of <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> design parameters. An analysis of usability and other design characteristics of 200 <b>Web</b> <b>sites</b> of different kinds revealed that design aspects, such as information content, ease of navigation, download delay, and <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> availability positively influence usability. <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> security and customization were not found to influence usability.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} model of {{versioned}} <b>web</b> <b>sites</b> which is aimed at building a <b>web</b> <b>site</b> configuration. The <b>web</b> <b>site</b> configuration is a consistent version of the <b>web</b> <b>site</b> and serves for navigation purposes. We exploit {{the fact that the}} versioning of <b>web</b> <b>sites</b> is in many aspects similar to versioning of software systems (and their components). On the other hand, specific characteristics related to the web environment and <b>web</b> <b>sites</b> in particular are considered. The <b>web</b> <b>site</b> is modelled by an AND/OR type graph. The model serves as a useful abstraction simplifying the process of configuration building. Being essentially a graph search, it is inevitable to have a method for selecting a proper version.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explain how Edith Cowan University (ECU) Library {{improved}} the accessibility of their <b>web</b> <b>site,</b> aiming for <b>Web</b> Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 2. 0 Level AA. It describes the results obtained. Design/methodology/approach – Initial testing by consultants was conducted in October 2012. The <b>web</b> <b>site</b> was defined as all webpages which appear part of the library <b>web</b> <b>site,</b> including supplier webpages, plus pages from the university <b>web</b> <b>site</b> and library <b>web</b> <b>site.</b> Library staff applied the recommendations to pages which they could edit, and discussed the recommendations with suppliers to improve their product’s accessibility. The <b>web</b> <b>site</b> was re-tested in June 2013. Social implications – A <b>web</b> <b>site</b> not complying with WCAG version 2. 0 would be very difficult for people with disabilities to access. Upgrading ECU Library’s <b>web</b> <b>site</b> will provide all users with more equal access to the resources. Findings – ECU Library <b>web</b> <b>site</b> failed WCAG 2. 0 Level A standard in the initial testing and re-testing. Many individual pages which failed initially passed the re-test. The smallest improvement was seen in suppliers’ <b>web</b> <b>sites.</b> Practical implications – This paper could help libraries to improve <b>web</b> <b>site</b> accessibility, as it covers negotiating with suppliers to upgrade their <b>web</b> <b>sites,</b> plus upgrading editable webpages. It shows initial and re-test results, allowing libraries to compare their results to those of ECU.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with mining the log file of a <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> for knowledge about the <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> and its users, and using the knowledge to assist users to navigate and search the <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> effectively and efficiently. First, we investigate approaches to adapting the organization and presentation of a <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> by learning from the <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> link structure and user behavior of the <b>Web</b> <b>site.</b> Approaches are developed for presenting a <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> using a link hierarchy and a conceptual link hierarchy respectively based on how users have used the <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> link structure. Link hierarchies and conceptual link hierarchies {{can be used to}} help users navigate the <b>Web</b> <b>site.</b> Second, we develop approaches for building a first-order Markov chain model of user navigation on the <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> link structure, link hierarchy, and conceptual link hierarchy respectively. Under a collaborative assumption, the model can be used for link prediction that assists users to navigate the <b>Web</b> <b>site.</b> Third, approaches are developed for ranking Web pages based on how users have used the <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> link structure. The page rankings can be used to help users search the <b>Web</b> <b>site.</b> The approaches developed in the thesis have been implemented in a prototype called Online Navigation Explorer (ONE). First, link hierarchies and conceptual link hierarchies are visualized in ONE. Second, link prediction using Markov chain models is integrated with link hierarchies and conceptual link hierarchies in ONE. Third, search results are visualized in ONE. Experimental results show that ONE can help users navigate a <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> and search for their desired information on the <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> effectively and efficiently.

40|$|Purpose – The aim is {{to explore}} users’ {{reactions}} to health information <b>web</b> <b>sites</b> {{from the perspective of}} trust, retrieval of relevant information and ease-of-use, and to establish the link between perceived quality, trust, and usability. Design/methodology/approach – An analysis of three Australian health <b>web</b> <b>sites</b> was undertaken. A usability test was conducted on those three <b>web</b> <b>sites</b> resulting in 207 completed user evaluations. The evaluations included both quantitative and qualitative data. Findings – The three investigated health information <b>web</b> <b>sites</b> do not meet the needs of health consumers. More details such as how information is selected to engender greater trust need to be provided. The retrieval of relevant information could be improved through the implementation of functionality such as spell checking and information differentiation. Finally, ensuring <b>web</b> <b>sites</b> are easy to use contributes to the level of trust users have in a <b>web</b> <b>site.</b> Research limitations/implications – This was a relatively small study investigating only three generic Australian health <b>web</b> <b>sites,</b> the results however suggest that a larger study looking at other health <b>web</b> <b>sites</b> is needed. Practical implications – For government agencies developing health information <b>web</b> <b>sites</b> more attention needs to be paid to the design of these <b>web</b> <b>sites</b> if users are to be encouraged to use the <b>web</b> <b>site</b> and return. The research suggests that effective health information <b>web</b> <b>sites</b> must be perceived to be of reliable quality, be trustworthy, have some level of intelligence to assist in the retrieval of relevant information, and be easy to use. Originality/value – Although there is much research relating to the relationship between <b>web</b> <b>site</b> design and trust for e-commerce transactional <b>web</b> <b>sites</b> this work has not been undertaken for <b>web</b> <b>sites</b> designed for information retrieval, in particular little work has been done of health information <b>web</b> <b>sites.</b> This paper fills in some of the gaps...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} how national cultural distance, {{defined as the}} extent to which the shared values and norms in one country differ from those in another, affect the number of <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> visits. Based on a sample of 2, 654 U.

In the case of <b>Web</b> <b>sites</b> containing sexually explicit material, we obtain a significantly positive effect of cultural distance. Our findings suggest that cultural distance can be both a source of attraction and a source of repulsion in explaining the number of <b>Web</b> <b>site</b> visits depending on the nature of the <b>Web</b> <b>site...</b>|$|R
