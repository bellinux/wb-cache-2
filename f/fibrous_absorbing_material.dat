40|$|International audienceThe {{performance}} of a full scale low height barrier prototype meant to attenuate tramway noise is measured in situ. The prototype is made of a simple L-shape assembly of pressed wood boards covered on the source side with <b>fibrous</b> <b>absorbing</b> <b>material,</b> and {{has been set up}} temporarily in a residential area in the town of Saint-Martin-d'H` eres, near Grenoble, through which a tramway line passes. A series of pass-by measurements were made at a close receiver location corresponding to the typical height of human ears, with and without the device. The tram speed has been measured as well using an auxiliary microphone located very close to the track. A significant variability in pass-by levels has been found between the different trams, even when applying an approximate correction for speed. However it is shown that the barrier provides on average an attenuation of more than 10 dB(A), during the whole pass-by. Spectral analysis of the recorded signals is carried out as well to estimate the barrier insertion loss more accurately. Furthermore, comparisons between measurements and simplistic BEM calculations show that numerical predictions can yield rather good estimates of the actual in situ performance, within a few dB(A) ...|$|E

The basis and criteria for decoupling of acoustic waves in the pores of the frame and compressional waves in the frame structure are established.

The normal incidence surface impedance and absorption coefficient of two types of Kevlar 29 and an open celled foam material are studied. Experimental values and theoretical results are brought into agreement when the structure factor is selected to provide a fit to the experimental data. A parametric procedure for achieving that fit is established. Both a bulk material quality factor and a high frequency impedance level are required to characterize the real and imaginary part of the surface impedance and absorption coefficient. A derivation of the concepts of equivalent density and dynamic resistance is presented...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{sound absorbing}} structure constructed using {{multiple layers of}} <b>fibrous</b> papers. Sound <b>absorbing</b> <b>materials</b> converts sound wave into thermal energy due to the porosity. The proposed sound absorbing structure has helical-like shapes in layered format with cyclic winding of the mulberry papers and coconut fibers. The acoustic properties changes depending on {{the thickness of the}} air cavity between the thin layers and porosity of the layers themselves. Sound absorption coefficients were measured using two-microphone impedance tube in order to investigate the acoustic property variations with porosity. The measured results were compared to predictions utilizing wave propagations through a slit for verification of the sound absorbing mechanism. A simple method for improving the sound absorption with less material by composite structure is proposed and verified through the experiment. Dynamic stiffness and loss factor of the helical-shaped sound absorbers were measured and compared by analyzing supporting properties to the vibrating beam. Depending on the construction method, the frame dynamic properties showed variation even when the sound absorption was identical. This information is required for optimal design of absorbing layers for specific noise control applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

50|$|A microbolometer {{consists}} of an array of pixels, each pixel being made up of several layers. The cross-sectional diagram shown in Figure 1 provides a generalized view of the pixel. Each company that manufactures microbolometers has their own unique procedure for producing them and they even {{use a variety of}} different <b>absorbing</b> <b>materials.</b> In this example the bottom layer {{consists of}} a silicon substrate and a readout integrated circuit (ROIC). Electrical contacts are deposited and then selectively etched away. A reflector, for example, a titanium mirror, is created beneath the IR <b>absorbing</b> <b>material.</b> Since some light is able to pass through the absorbing layer, the reflector redirects this light back up to ensure the greatest possible absorption, hence allowing a stronger signal to be produced. Next, a sacrificial layer is deposited so that later in the process a gap can be created to thermally isolate the IR <b>absorbing</b> <b>material</b> from the ROIC. A layer of <b>absorbing</b> <b>material</b> is then deposited and selectively etched so that the final contacts can be created. To create the final bridge like structure shown in Figure 1, the sacrificial layer is removed so that the <b>absorbing</b> <b>material</b> is suspended approximately 2 μm above the readout circuit. Because microbolometers do not undergo any cooling, the <b>absorbing</b> <b>material</b> must be thermally isolated from the bottom ROIC and the bridge like structure allows for this to occur. After the array of pixels is created the microbolometer is encapsulated under a vacuum to increase the longevity of the device. In some cases the entire fabrication process is done without breaking vacuum.|$|R
