40|$|This {{report shows}} {{the results of}} the Interlaboratory Comparison ILC 01 - 2014, a {{follow-up}} of the previous ILC 01 - 2013. It is a Proficiency Testing (PT) on <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> <b>E</b> spiked with potential migrant substances carried out by the European Union Reference Laboratory (EURL) for Food Contact Materials (FCM). Regulation (EU) No 10 / 2011 establishes <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> <b>E</b> for testing migration compliance of plastics in contact with dry foodstuffs. The simulant E (Tenax®) was spiked with 7 substances at given concentrations tailored for this exercise, of which 3 were replaced from the previous year. A list containing 10 substances in which 7 were effectively present in the simulant was distributed to the participants. Homogeneity and stability studies were conducted. The main scope of this ILC 01 - 2014 was to evaluate the improvement on the performance of the National Reference Laboratories (NRLs) for specific analysis of potential migrants in Tenax®. The participants should identify and quantify the substances spiked in the food simulant by using the analytical method of their choice. The z-score values, for each substance/laboratory, were obtained by the assigned value calculated with the results reported by the participants (robust mean). The participation of the laboratories in this follow-up on identification and quantification of the substances in <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> <b>E</b> was very satisfactory regarding the number of received results as well as the significant improvement in the performance of the NRLs.

40|$|This {{publication}} {{presents the}} outcome of the development, optimisation and validation at EU level of a harmonised method for using poly (2, 6 -diphenyl phenylene oxide, abbreviated PPPO here) which is stipulated in Regulation (EU) No 10 / 2011 as <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> <b>E</b> for testing specific migration from plastics into dry foodstuffs. Two methods for fortifying respectively PPPO and a Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) film with surrogate substances that are relevant to food contact were developed. A protocol for cleaning the PPPO and an efficient analytical method was developed for the quantification of Butylhydroxytoluene (BHT), Benzophenone (BP), Diisobutylphthalate (DiBP), Diethyladipate (DEHA) and 1, 2 -cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, diisononyl (DINCH) from PPPO. A protocol for a migration test from plastics using small migration cells was also developed. The harmonised method was validated by an interlaboratory comparison (ILC) with 16 national reference laboratories for food contact materials in the European Union. This allowed to obtain data on precision and laboratory performance for both migration and quantification for the first time. The results showed that the validation ILC was successful even taking into account the complexity of the exercise. The results showed that the method performance was 7 - 9 % repeatability standard deviation (rsd) for most substances (regardless of concentration), with 12 % rsd for the high level of BHT and for DiBP at very low levels. The reproducibility results for the 16 EU laboratories were in the range of 20 - 30 % for the quantification from PPPO (for the 3 levels of concentrations of the 5 substances) and 15 - 40 % from migration experiments from the fortified plastic at 60 C for 10 days and subsequent quantification. Considering the lack of the data previously available in the literature, this work demonstrated that the validation of a method is possible both for migration and for quantification. JRC.

Silver release was investigated at temperatures in the 20 - 70 °C range using contact times of up to 10 days. Migration of silver from the food box was in all cases 2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than that observed for the baby bottle, although the total silver content in the original box material was half of that found in the baby bottle. As expected, for both food containers, silver migration depended on both {{the nature of the}} tested solution and the applied conditions. The highest release was observed for 3 % acetic acid at 70 °C for 2 h, corresponding to 62 ng dm and 1887 ng dm of silver for the baby bottle and the food box, respectively. Single particle-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SP-ICPMS) was used to characterise and quantify AgNPs in the <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> extracts. Sample preparation was optimized to preserve AgNPs integrity. The experimental parameters affecting AgNPs detection, sizing and quantification by SP-ICPMS were also optimised. Analyses of water and acidic extracts revealed the presence of both dissolved silver and AgNPs. Small AgNPs (in the 18 - 30 nm range) and particle number concentrations within the 4 - 1510 10 L range were detected, corresponding to only 0. 1 - 8. 6 % of the total silver released from these materials. The only exception was AgNPs migrated into water at 40 °C and 70 °C from the food box, which accounted for as much as 34 % and 69 % of the total silver content, respectively.

The total migration was determined gravimetrically in the ethanol and acetic acid <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> at different time and temperature conditions, while migrants were detected by laser diffraction analysis and transmission electron microscopy.

Fast and reliable analytical procedures were developed and validated {{for the analysis of}} the studied AOs in <b>food</b> <b>simulants.</b> For aqueous <b>food</b> <b>simulants,</b> solid phase extraction followed by GC–MS analysis was performed. Fatty <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> were directly analysed by GC–MS and HPLC-UV for isooctane and ethanol 950 mL/L, respectively. The release of AOs from the films was dependent on the type of food stimulant and AO incorporated. In particular, high levels of migration were obtained for both AOs into isooctane, showing thymol higher migration. The release kinetics of AOs from PP films showed a Fichian behaviour with diffusion coefficients ranging from 1 to 2 × 10 − 14 m 2 /s; except for the diffusion into isooctane where 4 - 6 higher values were obtained. The antioxidant activity of migration extracts was confirmed by the DPPH method, showing thymol a higher antioxidant capacity especially into isooctane with a 42. 2 % of inhibition.

Migration into aqueous simulants exceeded the current European Union limit for total migration from plastic materials (assumed to be currently applicable to these systems) and was probably excessive by any reasonable standard.

However, if the migration calculation should not be too over-estimative, the polymer specific kinetic parameter for migration modelling, the so-called AP value, should be established appropriately. One objective {{of the study was}} the kinetic determination of the specific migration behaviour of low molecular weight compounds such as solvents with relatively high diffusion rates and therefore with high migration potential from the PET bottle wall into <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> in comparison with real beverages. For this purpose model contaminants were introduced into the bottle wall during preform production. The volatile compounds toluene and chlorobenzene were established at concentrations from about 20 to 30 ppm up to 300 to 350 ppm. Phenyl cyclohexane was present at concentrations of 35 ppm, 262 ppm and 782 ppm, respectively. The low volatile compounds benzophenone and methyl stearate have bottle wall concentrations of about 100 ppm in the low spiking level up to about 1000 ppm in the highly spiked test bottle. From these experimental data the polymer specific parameters (AP values) from mathematical migration modelling were derived. The experimental determined diffusing coefficients were determined, calculated and compared with literature data and an AP' value of 1 was derived thereof for non-swelling <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> like 3 % acetic acid, 10 % ethanol or iso-octane. For more swelling condition e. g. 95 % ethanol as <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> an AP' value of 3. 1 seems to be suitable for migration calculation. In relation to PET recycling safety aspects, maximum concentrations in the bottle wall were established for migrants / contaminants with different molecular weights, which correspond with a migration limit of 10 ppb. From the experimental data obtained using <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> and in comparison with beverages, the most appropriate <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> for PET packed foods with a sufficient but not too over-estimative worse case character was found to be 50 % ethanol. In addition, it can be shown that mass transport from PET is generally controlled by the very low diffusion in the polymer and, as a consequence, partitioning coefficients (KP/F values) of migrants between the polymer material and the foodstuff do not influence the migration levels significantly. An important consequence is that migration levels from PET food contact materials are largely independent from the nature of the packed food which on the other hand simplifies exposure estimations from PET...|$|R
40|$|To {{establish}} {{the stability of}} Ultranox 626 (an antioxidant added to plastics) in <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> under migration conditions, migrations tests have been performed. A method has been developed for the determination of Ultranox 626 in the aqueous <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> distilled water, 3 % (w/v) acetic acid, and 15 % (v/v) ethanol and in the fatty <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> 95 % (v/v) ethanol and isooctane. The method uses reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection at 230 nm, is fast, and can be run automatically. To determine the stability of Ultranox 626, it was heated {{in each of the}} listed <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> under the conditions stipulated in EU regulations for testing for compliance with migration limits. These experiments showed that this additive had acceptable stability in water, 15 % and 95 % (v/v) ethanol, and isooctane but that it decomposed completely in 3 % (w/v) acetic acid. Migration testing with 3 % acetic acid is of no use, since {{by the end of the}} testing regime the additive will have undergone substantial or total decomposition, and the level detected will not reflect the true level of migration. The EU Commission should replace 3 % acetic acid with 15 % ethanol as an appropriate test simulant for the determination of Ultranox 626 in all types of acid- and alcohol-containing foodstuffs. A number of experiments were carried out to develop a suitable method for the determination of Ultranox in fat simulants such as olive oil and HB 307. It appeared not possible, within the scope of this project, to obtain a method suitable to {{establish the}} stability of Ultranox 626 in fat simulants. Best results were obtained by freezing out the fat at - 80 °C, but recovery was limited to 50 %, which was insufficient for the intended purpose. Further experiments are required to establish the stability of Ultranox 626 in fat simulants such as olive oil and HB 307...|$|R

Liquid chromatography is used with UV detection and 2 -methyl- 1, 3 -dihydroxybenzene as internal standard. Repeatability, stability, and migration tests were conducted. The limits of detection were in the range 0. 03 - 0. 40 mg/kg for the 3 phenols in aqueous and fatty <b>food</b> <b>simulants.</b> Relative repeatability standard deviations at migration limits of 6, 2. 4, and 0. 6 mg/kg for 1, 2 -, 1, 3 -, and 1, 4 -dihydroxybenzene, respectively, ranged from 0. 8 to 4. 8 % for the <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> tested. A commercial sample of polyetherketone made from 1, 4 -dihydroxybenzene was tested with the method. No polymer-derived interferences were found. The method is thus suitable for testing against migration limits for the 3 monomers...|$|R
40|$|Overall {{migration}} (OM) {{tests were}} conducted on an antioxidant active packaging prepared by coating plasma pre-treated and untreated polyethylene terepthalate (PET) trays with a Citrus extract. The release of antioxidant compounds into <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> was measured to permit their subtraction from OM values in line with active packaging legislation. The results demonstrated the compliance of the packaging with the limit for OM for plastic material in contact with food. The validity of the procedure for OM in aqueous <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> was questioned, {{with the loss of}} volatile compounds during evaporation of the simulant resulting in an underestimation of total compounds released. The study showed a total release of 75 % of the Citrus extract coating into water and 25 % into oil, which decreased to 45 % and 12. 5 % respectively following the plasma pre-treatment of the trays.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an inter-laboratory comparison on the specific migration of caprolactam (CAP) and 2, 4 -di-tert butyl phenol (2, 4 -DTBP) from a plastic food contact material in <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> A (ethanol 10 %, v/v) organised by the EURL-FCM, Ispra (Italy). Homogeneity and stability studies were conducted. Participants had to carry out a migration test by immersion with <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> A for 10 days at 60 oC, to quantify the migration of caprolactam (CAP) in <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> A, and to provide details of the analytical and sample extraction procedure. In addition a by-product 2, 4 -di-tert butyl phenol (2, 4 -DTBP) was also present and had to be quantified. The assigned values of the migration of the migrant were calculated as the robust mean of the results reported by the participants by applying the Q/Hampel method robust statistics. The participation to the ILC was satisfactory with 28 out of 29 participating laboratories submitting results. The z-score values of the laboratories for each substance were calculated based on the assigned value. In the case of CAP and also for the more challenging non intentionally added substances 2, 4 -DTBP more than 82 % of the results were fully satisfactory (|z-score|< 2). This percentage rose to close to 90 % for z-scores < 3 in the compliance evaluation of the regulated substance CAP. JRC. F. 7 -Knowledge for Health and Consumer Safet...|$|R
40|$|Microwave food {{packaging}} {{has become a}} tremendous element in the food manufacturing process. The purpose of any {{food packaging}} regulations concerned with {{the safety of the}} food is to control and limit the migration of substances from the packaging into the food. The main objective of this thesis is to test three different microwaving packaging materials that are the most common material in the market, viz. polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), migrated into four <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> solutions. Four different simulant solutions were used based on the food type and FDA recommendations and regulations. These <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> include vegetable pure oil, 3 % (v/v) aqueous acetic acid, 15 % (v/v) ethanol, and olive oil in the temperature of 100 °C. Headspace gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (GC/MS) was used to determine the relative migration values from packaging materials into food by putting the materials into contact with simulants for 10 days in temperature of 5 °C. The analyzed results show that the migrations of food package are dependent on microwaving time, package material types and simulant types. The polystyrene (PS) caused the fastest relative migration in olive oil while the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has the most relative migration in <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> containing 15 % ethanol. In addition, acetaldehyde, which may be hazardous to consumers, was found in both 3 % aqueous acetic acid and olive oil after 10 minutes microwaving from PET...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of complexation on {{the release of}} alpha-tocopherol from Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) film was examined. Specific migration studies were performed at 7. 0 ± 0. 5 °C using plastic bags filled with 95 % ethanol as fatty <b>food</b> <b>simulant.</b> The amount of complexed and free (non-complexed) alpha-tocopherol migrated into the <b>food</b> <b>simulant</b> {{was followed by a}} high performance liquid chromatography system (HPLC). It was concluded that complexation in beta-cyclodextrin had a significant effect on the release rate of the antioxidant. Using a mathematical model for the description of the migration one order of magnitude decrease in diffusion coefficient (D) was calculated in case of complexed alpha-tocopherol compared to free form. Total migration of alpha-tocopherol from both films was observed meaning that the partition coefficient of tocopherol was not influenced by the incorporation in cyclodextrin. Thus, complexation might be the key to a long lasting antioxidative effect of such kind of active packaging...|$|R
40|$|A {{major problem}} {{associated}} {{with the development of}} complex polymeric materials for food contact applications is the potential for migration of toxic substances from the polymer to the food. This thesis investigates the transfer of migrants from non-ovenable food contact materials at elevated temperatures, and several applications where migration has occurred have been identified. Boil in the bag applications lead to exposure times of 30 - 120 minutes for complex multilayer laminates, whilst plastic kettles are repeat exposure items, and plastic 'vacuum flasks' have a potential for up to 4 hours exposure. Analytical techniques including, GC-MS, LC-MS, HPLC and UV spectroscopy have been employed to quantify the species migrating from these food contact materials into aqueous and oil simulants, and to ensure that they conform to the implemented EC restrictions. Olive oil is a stipulated EC fatty <b>food</b> <b>simulant,</b> but it is unsuitable for specific migration analyses since it contains many interfering compounds. These could not be eliminated by repeated solvent extraction, and a silicone oil was therefore substituted. In an attempt to identify the species migrating into aqueous and fatty <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> both the final materials and also the individual components i. e. nylon, adhesive, polyethylene and polypropylene were examined separately. HPLC techniques have been developed to quantify both the known levels of antioxidants present in the polymers and also the anticipated degradation products from these materials. Typical levels of antioxidants in simulants range from < 0. 1 (aqueous) to 45 j [...] lgdm- 2 (oil) and < 0. 1 (aqueous) to 200 j [...] lgdm" (oil) for antioxidant degradation products. In commercial boil in the bag laminates the major migrants {{have been shown to be}} derived principally from the nylon film, and the polyurethane adhesive used to fabricate the laminate. Le-MS investigations have confirmed the presence of the residual monomer Ecaprolactarn and its cyclic oligomers (up to the nonarner) in aqueous <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> boiled in direct contact with the nylon 6. This technique has also identified the main migrants from the aliphatic and aromatic polyurethane adhesives to be residual oligomers from the polyols. Any residual isocyanates in the adhesive are converted to the corresponding amine, and colourimetric assays have determined levels between 1. 1 and O. lj [...] lgdm". Measured, migration levels into fatty <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> were found to be greater than in aqueous <b>food</b> <b>simulants.</b> However, none of the material examined showed an overall migration value greater than the EC limit of 10 mg dm" for single sided testing. Some instances were found where the consumer was instructed to boil the dry food part of a boil in the bag meal in the same water as that used to heat the pouch containing the meat, and under these circumstances a total migration value for the laminate greater than 10 mg dm- 2 was measured...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe release {{study of}} natural antioxidants, i. e., {{ascorbyl}} palmitate and α-tocopherol, and synthetic phenolic antioxidants including butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, and tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) from polylactic acid (PLA) film into <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> were accomplished. PLA antioxidant films {{were placed in}} contact with 95, 50, and 10  % ethanol at 40 and 20  °C. Released antioxidants were regularly measured by high-performance liquid chromatography system for 60  days. Ascorbyl palmitate was completely degraded during film preparation {{and is not a}} suitable antioxidant for PLA antioxidant-active packaging. The diffusion coefficient (D) and partition coefficient (K) of antioxidants were calculated based on obtained data. Diffusion of the antioxidants from PLA to the simulants showed a Fick's behavior with the diffusion coefficient (D) value between 10 − 9 and 10 − 11  cm 2  s− 1 with 0 ― 100  % of release. Faster and higher release of antioxidants occurred at 40  °C according to Arrhenius law. At 40  °C, TBHQ in 95  % ethanol decomposed to 2 -tert-butyl- 1, 4 -benzoquinone and other quinone derivatives, and α-tocopherol in 50  % ethanol decomposed to some unknown neoformed compounds. Antioxidants molecular weight, Log P, simulant polarity, and temperature were the most influencing factors on antioxidants release rate from PLA films in contact with <b>food</b> <b>simulants.</b> The D and K coefficients of studied antioxidants from PLA in three <b>food</b> <b>simulants</b> and two temperatures can be used to create PLA antioxidant-active packaging to continually control the oxidation reactions in diverse foodstuffs to ensure higher food qualities. The PLA antioxidant-active packaging approach also permits to reduce the amounts of directly added antioxidants in foods to provide safer foods...|$|R
