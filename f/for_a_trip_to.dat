5|$|In 1903, the English {{composer}} Ezra Read {{published a}} piano piece called A Trip to the Moon: Comic Descriptive Fantasia, which follows Méliès's film scene by scene {{and may have}} been used as a score for the film; it may have been commissioned by Méliès himself, who had likely met Read on one of his trips to England. More recent composers who have recorded scores <b>for</b> <b>A</b> <b>Trip</b> <b>to</b> the Moon include Nicolas Godin and Jean-Benoit Dunckel of Air (for the 2011 restoration; see the Hand-colored version section below), Frederick Hodges, Robert Israel, Eric Le Guen, Lawrence Lehérissey (a great-great-grandson of Méliès), Donald Sosin, and Victor Young (for an abridged print featured as a prologue to the 1956 film Around the World in 80 Days).|$|E

The ship made a short stop in New York City before joining the 2nd Battleship Division for another tour of Europe. This trip included stops in Copenhagen, Stockholm, and Kronstadt. On the way back from Kronstadt, South Carolina stopped in Kiel, where the German Kaiser Wilhelm II was hosting the annual Kieler Woche (Kiel Week) sailing regatta.

Stafford of the U.S. Army Medical Corps, {{who was killed}} during the air raid on Broome, Western Australia, while {{participating}} in the evacuation of Java on 3March 1942. With her conversion complete in September 1944, the Stafford, equipped with new boilers, a single stack in place of her original two, and other improvements, moved to her new homeport of Charleston. From that port the ship made monthly runs to the United Kingdom and back until May 1945, interrupting the pattern only once <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> Gibraltar and Marseilles. Steaming to New York {{at the conclusion of}} her last transatlantic run, Charles A. Stafford was overhauled for duty in the South Pacific.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked in}} 1930 what {{inspired}} him <b>for</b> <b>A</b> <b>Trip</b> <b>to</b> the Moon, Méliès credited Jules Verne's novels From the Earth to the Moon (1865) and Around the Moon (1870). Cinema historians, the mid-20th-century French writer Georges Sadoul first among them, have frequently suggested H. G. Wells's The First Men in the Moon (1901), a French translation {{of which was}} published {{a few months before}} Méliès made the film, as another likely influence. Sadoul argued that {{the first half of the}} film (up to the shooting of the projectile) is derived from Verne and that the second half (the travelers' adventures on and in the moon) is derived from Wells.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} in Turkey {{he met with}} Skene, the British Vice-Consul, who had him introduced to Omar Pasha and invited to view the Turkish regiments. Nolan was not particularly impressed by them, judging the irregulars incapable of withstanding a Russian cavalry charge and finding the horses too small. He ordered 250 of them anyway, finding them appropriate for the British artillery {{if not for the}} cavalry. His report to Somerset (now Baron Raglan, and commander of the British forces in Turkey) included a proposal <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> Syria, where he claimed the horses were more appropriate. This proposal was eventually agreed to, and he went to İskenderun on 9 May. When they arrived they discovered that Turkish officials had already bought most of the army horses in northern Syria, and so they continued on to Beirut and then Damascus. Even there, they failed to find horses of sufficient quality, and so they left the city on 21 May in hopes of making contact with the Bedouin. They left with a train of 292 horses, mostly bought from the 'Anizzah, and were met at Beirut by the steamship Trent and transported back to Turkey.|$|E

5|$|Commander Matsumura Junzō {{arrived in}} London on 21 July and gave Reed the {{specifications}} for the ships. Reed responded on 3 September with an offer, excluding armament, that exceeded {{the amount allocated}} in the budget. Ueno signed the contracts for all three ships on 24 September despite this problem because Reed was scheduled to depart <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>trip</b> <b>to</b> Russia and the matter had to be concluded before his departure. Ueno had informed the Navy Ministry about the costs before signing, but Kawamura's response to postpone the order for the armored frigate did not arrive until 8 October. The totals for all three contracts came to £433,850 or ¥2,231,563 and {{did not include the}} armament. These were ordered from Krupp with a 50 percent down payment of £24,978. The government struggled to provide the necessary money even though the additional expenses had been approved by the Prime Minister's office on 5 June 1876, especially as more money was necessary to fully equip the ships for sea and to provision them for the delivery voyage to Japan.|$|E
