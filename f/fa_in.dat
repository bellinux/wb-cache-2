The {{retirement}} of Arshad Khamis and Dollah Kassim prompted Jita Singh, the new Singapore FA coach, to play Fandi as a striker. During the 1980 Malaysia Cup season, Fandi scored eight goals, including the winning goal in the final against Selangor FA. He enlisted for National Service in September 1980 and was given light duties, such as collecting the camp garbage, so he could continue playing for Singapore <b>FA.</b> <b>In</b> 1981, Fandi won the FAS Footballer of the Year award for helping Singapore FA reach the Malaysia Cup final. The following year, Singapore FA did not play in the Malaysia Cup for political reasons, and Fandi underwent a shoulder operation; he could not play football for six weeks and was discharged early from National Service.|$|E

Twelve changes {{were made to the}} FA code between 1863 and 1870, of which eight were taken from Sheffield Rules. During this period the Sheffield FA had significant influence over the FA and encouraged it to continue when it was close to collapse in 1867. The corner kick was adopted by the <b>FA</b> <b>in</b> 1872 and they restricted handling of the ball to the goalkeeper's own half in 1873.

They were not universally adopted. During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the Sheffield Football Club, formed by former public school pupils in 1857, which led to formation of a Sheffield <b>FA</b> <b>in</b> 1867.

Chelsea continued to play regional wartime fixtures as national league football had not resumed for the 1945–46 season, and Lawton also continued his uncapped appearances for the England national team. In the summer of 1946, following his demobilisation, he coached for the <b>FA</b> <b>in</b> a summer camp in Switzerland. He scored a club record 26 goals in 34 league games in the 1946–47 season. However he struggled to settle at Stamford Bridge and came into conflict with manager Billy Birrell after refusing to go on a pre-season tour of Sweden in 1947, which resulted in him requesting {{a transfer}}. He favoured a move to Arsenal, but this was ruled out by the Chelsea hierarchy. Lawton turned down an approach by Sunderland manager Bill Murray as he held out hope that Chelsea would relent and allow him a move to Arsenal.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 2000 a {{consortium}} led by Pete Winkelman proposed a large retail development in Milton Keynes including a Football League-standard stadium, and offered this site to Luton, Wimbledon, Barnet, Crystal Palace and Queens Park Rangers. Røkke and Gjelsten appointed a new chairman, Charles Koppel, who announced on 2 August 2001 that Wimbledon intended {{to relocate to}} Milton Keynes. Koppel said the club would otherwise go out of business. After the League refused permission, Koppel launched an appeal, leading to an FA arbitration hearing and subsequently {{the appointment of a}} three-man independent commission by the <b>FA</b> <b>in</b> May 2002 to make a final and binding verdict. The League and FA stated opposition but the commissioners ruled in favour, two to one. The vast majority of the team's fans switched allegiance to AFC Wimbledon in protest. Wimbledon F.C.'s relocation was delayed for over a year by the lack of an interim ground in Milton Keynes meeting Football League standards. In June 2003 the club went into administration; Winkelman's consortium injected funds to keep it operating and paid for the renovation of the National Hockey Stadium in Milton Keynes, where the team played its first match in September 2003. Winkelman's Inter MK Group bought the relocated club in 2004 and concurrently changed its name, badge and colours. The team's new ground, Stadium mk, opened three years later. MK Dons initially claimed Wimbledon F.C.'s heritage and history, but were forced to officially renounce this in 2007. AFC Wimbledon received planning permission for a new ground on Plough Lane in 2015, however these plans have major negative repercussions for the future of Kingsmeadow and Kingstonian F.C..|$|E

40|$|Northern {{elephant}} seal pups were longitudinally sampled at Año Nuevo State Reserve during the post-weaning fast, {{in order to}} evaluate the changes of fatty acid (<b>FA)</b> profiles <b>in</b> serum {{as well as in}} the inner and outer layers of blubber. The major FAs of inner and outer blubber layers were broadly similar to those found in NES maternal milk previously measured, suggesting a direct deposit of dietary <b>FAs</b> <b>in</b> the blubber during the suckling period. The outer blubber layer contained more medium-chain monounsaturated <b>FAs</b> that contribute <b>in</b> keeping the fluidity of this tissue at cold temperatures. It was compensated by higher proportions of saturated <b>FAs</b> <b>in</b> the inner blubber layer. The FA signature of inner blubber, the layer that is mainly mobilised during energy deprivation, slightly differed from the signature of serum. There were greater proportions of medium-chain saturated FAs and ω- 6 polyunsaturated FAs, and lower proportions of long-chain saturated FAs, medium-chain monounsaturated FAs and long-chain monounsaturated <b>FAs</b> <b>in</b> serum as compared to inner blubber. We also demonstrated that lipophilicity is the main factor governing the mobilisation of FAs from blubber. The least lipophilic FAs were preferentially hydrolysed from blubber, leading to an enrichment of the more lipophilic <b>FAs</b> <b>in</b> this tissue with the progression of the fast. The expression levels of HSL and ATGL, which are two enzymes involved in the lipolytic process, remained stable during the post-weaning fast. This suggests that the pups have developed the enzymatic mechanisms for an efficient lipolysis as soon as the first week of fast...|$|R
40|$|Background Biomarker {{fatty acids}} (FAs) {{reflecting}} de novo lipogenesis (DNL) are strongly {{linked to the}} risk of cardiometabolic diseases.

25|$|By {{this time}} the club had decided only to play teams outside Sheffield in order to seek a bigger challenge. On 31 March 1866, there was a match between a team {{representing}} the city of Sheffield and one representing London, at Battersea Park. Rules that differed only slightly from the FA rules were used. The game, played as an eleven aside, was won by London by 2 goals and four touchdowns to nil. However the matter of rules remained a problem with Sheffield clubs continuing to play by their own rules. A number of rule proposals by the club were rejected by the <b>FA</b> <b>in</b> February 1867 and the London Committee were reluctant to commit to further fixtures over Sheffield's refusal to play strictly to FA rules. Sheffield clubs finally adopted the FA rules in 1878.|$|E

In 1862, John Charles Thring of Uppingham School also devised an influential set of rules. His brother, headmaster of the school Reverend Edward Thring, was a proponent of football as an alternative to masturbation, seen as weakening the boys, and through football hoped to encourage their development of perceived manly attributes which were present in the sport.

40|$|Producing unusual {{fatty acids}} (<b>FAs)</b> <b>in</b> crop plants {{has been a}} long-standing goal of green chemistry. However, {{expression}} of the enzymes that catalyze the primary synthesis of these unusual <b>FAs</b> <b>in</b> transgenic plants typically results in low levels of the desired FA. For example, seed-specific expression of castor (Ricinus communis) fatty acid hydroxylase (RcFAH) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) resulted in only 17 % hydroxy fatty acids (HFAs) in the seed oil. In order to increase HFA levels, we investigated castor phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (PDAT). We cloned cDNAs encoding three putative PDAT enzymes from a castor seed cDNA library and coexpressed them with RcFAH 12. One isoform, RcPDAT 1 A, increased HFA levels to 27 %. Analysis of HFA-triacylglycerol molecular species and regiochemistry, along with analysis of the HFA content of phosphatidylcholine, indicates that RcPDAT 1 A functions as a PDAT in vivo. Expression of RcFAH 12 alone leads to a significant decrease <b>in</b> <b>FA</b> content of seeds. Coexpression of RcPDAT 1 A and RcDGAT 2 (for diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2) with RcFAH 12 restored FA levels to nearly wild-type levels, and this {{was accompanied by a}} major increase in the mass of HFAs accumulating in the seeds.
