5|$|For {{many years}} it was {{believed}} that Alkan met his death when a bookcase toppled over and fell on him as he reached for a volume of the Talmud from a high shelf. This tale, which was circulated by the pianist Isidor Philipp, is dismissed by Hugh Macdonald, who reports the discovery of a contemporary letter by one of his pupils explaining that Alkan had been found prostrate <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>kitchen,</b> under a porte-parapluie (a heavy coat/umbrella rack), after his concierge heard his moaning. He had possibly fainted, bringing it down on himself while grabbing out for support. He was reportedly carried to his bedroom and died later that evening. The story of the bookcase may have its roots in a legend told of Aryeh Leib ben Asher, rabbi of Metz, the town from which Alkan's family originated.|$|E

Lumpy asks that she appear with him, but Johnnie says the meeting is private. Supposing Bubblegum has stolen his heart, Lumpy leaves in a fit of rage.|$|E

60|$|For {{some years}} after this {{the king and}} queen lived {{together}} in great prosperity. Outwardly things went pretty well with the king's affairs, and, as he was fond of pomp and display, he gradually acquired habits of very profuse and lavish expenditure. Indeed, he is said to have made it an object of his ambition to surpass, in the magnificence of his style of living, all the sovereigns of Europe. He kept many separate establishments <b>in</b> <b>his</b> different palaces, and at all of them gave entertainments and banquets of immense magnificence and of the most luxurious character. It is said that three hundred persons were employed <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>kitchens.</b>|$|R
25|$|Louis {{started making}} chocolates <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>kitchen</b> {{for friends and}} family, but when he started selling the chocolates to local businesses, he had to move the {{operation}} to the garage. Chokolit was founded in 2005 and funded with a local grant of £5,000 and a £500 loan from his grandparents to buy a special machine that regulates chocolate temperature. The name of the company was chosen because {{that was how he}} used to spell chocolate due to his dyslexia.|$|E

The first miniature was found close by. It was a perfect diorama of the kitchen, and even included objects in the garbage and placement of Delancy's blood. In the model they also found a picture of a bloodied doll, hidden behind a mini photo frame, and a bleach container in the miniature garbage.|$|E

500|$|Haynes {{ordered a}} one-horsepower marine upright, two-cycle engine from Sintz Gas Engine Company in Grand Rapids, Michigan for $225. Although {{the engine was}} {{intended}} for use on a small boat, Haynes believed it could be adapted for his purposes. The [...] engine arrived {{in the fall of}} 1893. Haynes soon had the device attached to a carriage he built <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>kitchen.</b> He found when he started the engine that its vibrations were too severe for the harness it was in, and before he could stop the engine it had done considerable damage to the carriage and the floor of his kitchen, and filled the room with smoke.|$|E
500|$|The final track, [...] "Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast", {{is divided}} into three segments, each with its own {{descriptive}} title, joined by dialogue and sound effects of then-roadie Alan Styles preparing, discussing, and eating breakfast. The idea for the piece came about by Waters experimenting with the rhythm of a dripping tap, which combined sound effects and dialogue recorded by Mason <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>kitchen</b> with musical pieces recorded at Abbey Road. A slightly re-worked version was performed on stage on 22 December 1970 at Sheffield City Hall, Sheffield, England with the band members pausing between pieces to eat and drink their breakfast. The original LP ends with the sound of the tap which continues into the inner groove, and thus plays on indefinitely.|$|E

500|$|More {{important}} to Carême's career was {{his contribution to}} the refinement of French cuisine. The basis for his style of cooking was his sauces, which he named mother sauces. Often referred to as fonds, meaning [...] "foundations", these base sauces, espagnole, velouté, and béchamel, are still known today. Each of these sauces was made in large quantities <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>kitchen,</b> then {{formed the basis of}} multiple derivatives. Carême had over one hundred sauces in his repertoire. In his writings, soufflés appear for the first time. Although many of his preparations today seem extravagant, he simplified and codified an even more complex cuisine that existed beforehand. Central to his codification of the cuisine were Le Maître d'hôtel français (1822), Le Cuisinier parisien (1828) and L'Art de la cuisine française au dix-neuvième siècle (1833–5).|$|E
500|$|Following {{performances}} by Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson, and Mary Wells, The Jacksons {{took to the}} stage for their first group performance together in eight years. The brothers sang a medley of their old hits. After they finished with [...] "I'll Be There", they left Michael alone on stage. He addressed the audience and then went into his routine. He wore black pants, leather penny loafers, a black sequined jacket, and a single white rhinestone glove. To begin his performance, Jackson snapped a fedora to his head and struck a pose—his right hand on his hat and his left leg bent. During a musical interlude, the singer executed a move that many believe to have sealed {{his status as a}} pop icon. Jackson glided backwards to perform the moonwalk, before he spun on his heels and landed en pointe. It was the first time Jackson had performed the moonwalk in public; he had practiced it <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>kitchen</b> prior to the show.|$|E

5000|$|Carlson's early experiments, {{conducted}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> apartment <b>kitchen,</b> were smoky, smelly, {{and occasionally}} explosive.

This often resulted in a sulfur fire, filling the building {{with the smell of}} rotten eggs. [...] In another experiment, the chemicals he was working with caught fire, and {{he and his wife were}} hard-pressed to extinguish the flames.|$|R

500|$|Waters was {{reportedly}} reduced to tears {{by the sight}} of his former bandmate, who was asked by fellow visitor Andrew King how he had managed to gain so much weight. Barrett said he had a large refrigerator <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>kitchen,</b> and that he had been eating lots of pork chops. He also mentioned that he was ready to avail the band of his services, but while listening to the mix of [...] "Shine On", showed no signs of understanding its relevance to his plight. He joined the guests at Gilmour's wedding reception in the EMI canteen, but left without saying goodbye. None of the band members saw him from that day on until his death in 2006. Although the lyrics had already been created, Barrett's presence on that day may have influenced the final part of the song – a subtle refrain performed by Wright from [...] "See Emily Play" [...] is audible {{towards the end of the}} album.|$|E
500|$|The band {{formed in}} Dublin on 25 September 1976. [...] Larry Mullen Jr., then a 14-year-old student at Mount Temple Comprehensive School, posted {{a note on}} the school's notice board in search of musicians for a new band—six people responded. Setting up <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>kitchen,</b> Mullen was on drums, with Paul Hewson ("Bono") on lead vocals; David Evans ("the Edge") and his older brother Dik Evans on guitar; Adam Clayton, a friend of the Evans {{brothers}} on bass guitar; and initially Ivan McCormick and Peter Martin, two other friends of Mullen. Mullen later described it as [...] "'The Larry Mullen Band' for about ten minutes, then Bono walked in and blew any chance I had of being in charge." [...] Martin, who had brought his guitar and amplifier to the first practice but could not play, did not remain with the group, and McCormick was dropped within a few weeks. The group settled on the name [...] "Feedback" [...] because {{it was one of the}} few technical terms they knew. Most of their initial material consisted of cover songs, which the band admitted was not their forte. Some of the earliest influences on the band were emerging punk rock acts, such as the Jam, the Clash, Buzzcocks, and Sex Pistols. The popularity of punk rock convinced the group that musical proficiency was not a prerequisite to success.|$|E
500|$|Joy Division {{were due}} to begin their first American tour in May 1980. While Curtis had {{expressed}} a desire to take time off to visit a few acquaintances, he feigned excitement about the tour around the band because {{he did not want to}} disappoint either his bandmates or Factory Records. At the time, Curtis's relationship with his wife, Deborah (the couple had married in 1975 as teenagers), was strained. Contributing factors were his ill health, his excluding her from band activities, and his affair with a young Belgian woman named Annik Honoré whom he had met on a 1979 European tour. The evening before Joy Division were to fly out for their first American tour, Curtis returned to his home in Macclesfield to talk to his by then estranged wife. He asked her to drop the divorce suit she had filed; later, he told her to leave him alone in the house until he caught a train to Manchester the following morning. Early on 18 May 1980, having spent the night watching the Werner Herzog film Stroszek, Curtis hanged himself <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>kitchen.</b> Deborah discovered his body later that day when she returned to their home. It came as a shock both to the band members and their management. In 2005, Wilson recollected: [...] "I think all of us made the mistake of not thinking his suicide was going to happen We all completely underestimated the danger. We didn't take it seriously. That's how stupid we were".|$|E
