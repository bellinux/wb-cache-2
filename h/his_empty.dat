5|$|The French and American armies {{marched through}} Philadelphia from September 2 to the 4th, where the American {{soldiers}} announced {{they would not}} leave Maryland until they received one month's pay in coin, {{rather than in the}} worthless Continental paper currency.

5|$|The {{following}} year, on September 19, 1827, Bowie and Wright {{attended a}} duel on a sandbar outside of Natchez, Mississippi. Bowie supported duellist Samuel Levi Wells III, while Wright supported Wells's opponent, Dr. Thomas Harris Maddox. The duellists each fired two shots and, as neither {{man had been}} injured, resolved their duel with a handshake. Other members of the groups, who had various reasons for disliking each other, began fighting. Bowie {{was shot in the}} hip; after regaining his feet he drew a knife, described as a butcher knife, and charged his attacker, who hit Bowie over the head with <b>his</b> <b>empty</b> pistol, breaking the pistol and knocking Bowie to the ground. Wright shot at and missed the prone Bowie, who returned fire and possibly hit Wright. Wright then drew his sword cane and impaled Bowie. When Wright attempted to retrieve his blade by placing his foot on Bowie's chest and tugging, Bowie pulled him down and disemboweled Wright with his large knife. Wright died instantly, and Bowie, with Wright's sword still protruding from his chest, was shot again and stabbed by another member of the group. The doctors who had been present for the duel removed the bullets and patched Bowie's other wounds.|$|E

He recalled that the Cowboys [...] "were leading their horses out of the gate when they were confronted, almost from ambush, by four of the Earps, Virgil. Wyatt, Morgan and Jim and by Doc Holliday.

500|$|Jericho Cross (voiced by Christopher Corey Smith): The {{protagonist of}} the game, a jaded American Civil War deserter and drifter {{who became a}} gunslinger and train robber. During his [...] "one last job", he {{releases}} Lazarus Malkoth from his prison in a failed attempt to steal the contents. While dueling with Lazarus, Jericho gets bitten and infected by the vampire curse. His already deadly skills are enhanced by his vampire powers that afford him superhuman strength, increased endurance, enhanced agility, and heightened senses, {{in the form of}} the bioluminescent red orb that regenerated from <b>his</b> <b>empty</b> eye socket. Shadow is Jericho's demonic horse that appears at his beckon. According to the developers, they created [...] "deep psychological profiles of every character in the game" [...] with [...] "hope that Jericho's character arc — as this desperate [...] that's robbing trains with a subconscious death wish — makes a believable transition into this half-vampire hybrid gunslinger and will ultimately envelop the player in his destiny: which is a guy that can be either a hero or a terror.
