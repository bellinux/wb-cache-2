40|$|Corporate <b>environmental</b> <b>reports</b> are {{increasingly}} viewed as {{products of the}} managerial framing of responsibility and stakeholders. This notion encouraged us to conduct a multiple case study on how stakeholders are framed in <b>environmental</b> <b>reports.</b> We show how interaction between companies and stakeholders is described in the <b>environmental</b> <b>reports</b> of three firms operating in different business sectors – financial, aviation and energy – {{over a period of}} five years. We use an inductively oriented content analysis to identify five categories of relationships being constructed in the data: demanding, promoting, committing, donating and preventing. We then show how commitment and promotion dominate. We conclude by discussing the implications of this type of managerial framing to maintaining business-as-usual approaches to corporate environmentalism and show how the critique of <b>environmental</b> <b>reports</b> derives from stakeholder accountability and critical approaches. We argue that managerial framing of stakeholders in <b>environmental</b> <b>reports</b> partly explains the increased criticism among stakeholder representatives and academics...|$|R

40|$|Audits of <b>environmental</b> <b>reports</b> first {{appeared}} {{about ten years}} ago. Both the number of <b>environmental</b> <b>reports</b> and the audit of these reports is still increasing. Audit firms perform {{a major part of}} these audits, but other professionals are also active in this field. Even today there are still important differences in the scope of these audits, in the audit procedures performed, {{in the structure of the}} audit report and in the way the opinion is formulated. This is confusing for readers of <b>environmental</b> <b>reports.</b> The different kinds of auditors should aim at more consistency in order to enhance credibility. In this thesis the various aspects common to all audits are identified. This general framework is further tailored using field evidence. In this way a framework is proposed for the audit of <b>environmental</b> <b>reports</b> that hopefully improves consistency and provides a basis for auditing in this continually changing field...|$|R
