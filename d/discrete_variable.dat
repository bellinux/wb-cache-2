40|$|In this study, the {{evolution}} strategy, {{which is one}} of {{the evolution}}ary algorithms, is modified to solve mixed-discrete optimization problems. Three approaches are proposed for handling <b>discrete</b> <b>variables.</b> The first approach is to treat <b>discrete</b> <b>variables</b> as continuous variables and replace the latter with <b>discrete</b> <b>variables</b> that are closest to the continuous variables. The second approach is to compress the difference between <b>discrete</b> <b>variables</b> so that <b>discrete</b> <b>variables</b> far away from the current value will have a higher probability of being selected. The third approach is to represent the <b>discrete</b> <b>variables</b> as integers. As a result, the difference between neighbouring <b>discrete</b> <b>variables</b> becomes equal. This also increases the probability of selection of <b>discrete</b> <b>variables</b> far away from the current value through the mutation operation. Five examples are tested representing single objective, multi-objective, unconstrained, constrained, pure <b>discrete</b> and mixed-discrete <b>variable</b> problems. From the results obtained from the test problems it is evident that the enhanced rank-niche evolution strategy algorithm yields better solutions than other methods for most of the test problems...|$|R

2500|$|The {{central limit theorem}} applies in {{particular}} to sums of independent and identically distributed discrete random variables. [...] A sum of discrete random variables is still a discrete random variable, so that we are confronted with a sequence of discrete random variables whose cumulative probability distribution function converges towards a cumulative probability distribution function corresponding to a continuous variable (namely that of the normal distribution). [...] This means that if we build a histogram of the realisations of the sum of [...] independent identical discrete variables, the curve that joins the centers of the upper faces of the rectangles forming the histogram converges toward a Gaussian curve as [...] approaches infinity, this relation is known as de Moivre–Laplace theorem.

40|$|This paper proposes {{and compares}} three {{iterative}} approaches for handling <b>discrete</b> <b>variables</b> in optimal power flow (OPF) computations. The first two approaches {{rely on the}} sensitivities of the objective and inequality constraints with respect to <b>discrete</b> <b>variables.</b> They set the <b>discrete</b> <b>variables</b> values either by solving a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem or by using a simple procedure based on a merit function. The third approach relies {{on the use of}} Lagrange multipliers corresponding to the <b>discrete</b> <b>variables</b> bound constraints at the OPF solution. The classical round-off technique and a progressive round-off approach have been also used as a basis of comparison. We provide extensive numerical results with these approaches on four test systems with up to 1203 buses, and for two OPF problems: loss minimization and generation cost minimization, respectively. These results show that the sensitivity-based approach combined with the merit function clearly outperforms the other approaches in terms of: objective function quality, reliability, and computational times. Furthermore, the objective value obtained with this approach has been very close to that provided by the continuous relaxation OPF. This approach constitutes therefore a viable alternative to other methods dealing with <b>discrete</b> <b>variables</b> in an OPF. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Accordingly, the <b>discrete</b> <b>variables</b> in each sub-problem will decrease, which will reduce the computational burden.|$|R
