5000|$|As David Nolan, Mary Margaret, Emma Swan, and Henry Mills {{arrive at}} the {{hospital}} for the delivery of the baby, Dr. Whale is there and ready to prep. Emma and Regina then put a protection spell around the hospital to keep Zelena away. Hook arrives to explain to Emma about why Zelena cursed him but when David interrupts the two by suggesting that Hook and Emma should go together to defeat Zelena, Emma is reluctant to have <b>Hook</b> <b>tag</b> along. At the same time, Gold, who is being watched by Zelena, is using his spinning wheel in his cage to create a pile of golden strands. Zelena then uses the strands to transform it into a golden brain that she'll use in her plans to create her time-travelling spell. They then put the items (Regina's heart, David's broken sword and the brain) in a circle. As Emma and Hook arrive to the farm to stop Zelena, she tells him that once this is over she and Henry are leaving Storybrooke but Hook thinks she is making a mistake, saying she is afraid. As Zelena and Gold approach the intruders, Zelena makes Emma choose between Hook and her magic, using her power to force Hook into an open water tank and make him drown. Emma then rescues Hook from the water and revives him with mouth-to-mouth. When their lips touch, a wave of magic is released from Emma and with it Hook's curse. Hook is stunned that Emma would make a sacrifice of giving up her magic to save him, asking her, [...] "What did you do?" ...|$|E

Ninetypercent of those recovered after having been in the river over winter were taken within 5 miles ofthe release site. Of 253 tagged wild cutthroat trout recovered, 64 were recovered in releaseareas, and 189 were recaptured one or more miles from their release sites (average for the latter,about 19 miles). Of 95 tagged wild Dolly Varden recovered, 27 were recovered in the releaseareas, and 68 were recovered one or more miles from release sites (average for the latter, 22. 2 miles). Twenty-seven tagged wild rainbow or steelhead trout were recovered; 14 in release areas, and 13 downstream from the release sites.

40|$|During December 1995, aggregations of cod (Gadus morhua) {{were found}} at several {{locations}} in shallow (30 – 100 m) waters in Smith Sound and Northwest Arm, but not in Southwest Arm in western Trinity Bay. Over 2 000 fish caught with jiggers and feathered <b>hooks</b> were <b>tagged</b> and released and another 204 were sampled for length, sex, maturity and otoliths. Cod were mostly between 40 and 80 cm with mean lengths typically around 56 cm. Ages of cod ranged from 3 to 8 years, but more than 50 % were 5 year olds. Mean weights-at-age were higher than those reported for commercial samples of cod from NAFO Div. 3 L during recent (1990 – 95) years. Cod were generally in good condition, with mean values of Fulton's K (based on round weight) in the range 0. 85 to 0. 94. Most cod sampled were adults, and examination of the gonads of females suggested they would spawn in the coming spring. In April 1996, {{as part of a}} hydroacoustic survey to estimate the biomass of cod in these areas, further biological sampling was conducted. Aggregations of cod were located in all three areas, particularly in Smith Sound and Southwest Arm. A total of 1 542 cod were caught with otter trawl, jiggers and feathered hooks, and gill nets. Cod in all three areas were generally large and of comparable size range and condition to those seen in December 1995. Comparison of the maturities of females revealed a dense aggregation of spawning fish in deep water (> 200 m) in the outer reaches of Smith Sound. In contrast, the cod in all other regions, including the inner reaches of Smith Sound, were mostly mature but not spawning and appeared destined to spawn later in the spring. The prevalence of the parasitic copepod Lernaeocera branchialis, particularly among larger fish and all sizes caught in Southwest Arm, was much higher than that of comparable sized fish sampled offshore over the past 13 years. Since transmission of the parasite occurs only during autumn and mainly in the inshore, the high prevalences suggest that these fish had resided inshore throughout the autumn and winter months...|$|R
