5000|$|Blizzard's pottery is hand-built. She used to {{find the}} {{material}} to create her ceramic art in the creek behind her house in the Appalachian hills. At first, she used a coal kiln built by her neighbor, Michael Martin, but later in life used an <b>electric</b> <b>kiln.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1956, Doulton {{consolidated}} {{their business}} in Stoke-on-Trent {{and closed the}} Lambeth Studio. This led Agnete {{to set up a}} workshop in her home in Acton. She bought a reasonable size <b>electric</b> <b>kiln</b> and acquired an industrial wheel, similar to the kind she had used at Bullers and Doulton.|$|E
50|$|Nowadays <b>electric</b> <b>kilns</b> are {{preferred}} {{since they}} reduce {{the margin of}} error.|$|R
50|$|Traditional kilns were wood firing, which {{required}} the pots {{to be protected}} in the glaze and luster firings by saggars or to be fired in a muffle kiln. Except for those making luster ware, modern tin-glaze potters use <b>electric</b> <b>kilns.</b>|$|R
5000|$|He {{first visited}} New Zealand in 1973 and emigrated in 1975, {{establishing}} {{a studio in}} Nelson. [...] For ten years he worked with a woodfired kiln, before experimenting with gas, diesel and <b>electric</b> <b>kilns.</b> He works largely with earthenware pottery.|$|R
50|$|In 1932, Waylande Gregory became {{artist in}} {{residence}} at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. Here, {{he was able to}} further develop his craft as, for the first time, he had access to the precise control of an <b>electric</b> <b>kiln.</b> His sculpture evolved into more Italianate forms, with more volume and weight than before.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>Electric</b> <b>Kiln</b> Ceramics, Richard Zakin elaborates on how {{the effects}} of rake and [...] "smoke-reduction firings" [...] can be {{achieved}} through using a simple <b>electric</b> <b>kiln,</b> rather than more elaborate wood-fired kilns. He specifically names Dick Lehman and Gerry Caplan with pioneering this approach: [...] "Smoke-reduction firings {{require the use of}} a saggar, which is a sealed container placed inside the firing chamber. A bed of flammable material such as sawdust is placed in the base of the saggar and the ware is placed on top. More flammable material is packed around the piece. The saggar is then put into the kiln and fired. As it burns, the sawdust carbonizes the surface of the piece, creating a rich, highly varied surface." [...] Zakin notes that this offers modern ceramic artists the [...] "convenience and flexibility of the electric kiln" [...] while also allowing them to [...] "exploit the right and complex effects of smoke reduction." ...|$|E
50|$|Electric kilns: kilns {{operated}} by electricity {{were developed in}} the 20th century, primarily for smaller scale use such as in schools, universities, and hobby centers. The atmosphere in most designs of <b>electric</b> <b>kiln</b> is rich in oxygen, {{as there is no}} open flame to consume oxygen molecules. However, reducing conditions can be created with appropriate gas input, or by using saggars in a particular way.|$|E
50|$|The {{type and}} the size of kilns that are used in raku are crucial in the outcome. One aspect that can affect the results is the use of <b>electric</b> versus gas <b>kilns.</b> <b>Electric</b> <b>kilns</b> allow easy {{temperature}} control. Gas kilns, which comprise brick or ceramic fibers, can be used in either oxidation or reduction firing and use propane or natural gas. Gas kilns also heat more quickly than <b>electric</b> <b>kilns,</b> but it is more difficult to maintain temperature control. There is a note-worthy difference when using an updraft kiln rather than a downdraft kiln. An updraft kiln has shelves that trap heat. This effect creates uneven temperatures throughout the kiln. Conversely, a downdraft kiln pulls air down a separate stack on the side and allows a more even temperature throughout and allows the work to be layered on shelves.|$|R
50|$|In {{its early}} history the firm {{manufactured}} tea and breakfast wares, exporting to Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. However, in the 1930s, Paragon expanded both its market, {{to include the}} Americas, and its range of products to include dinnerware. Also at this time, Paragon began its move towards creating a smokeless factory, installing <b>electric</b> <b>kilns.</b>|$|R
50|$|Finch {{had always}} been {{inspired}} by the Japanese potter Shoji Hamada, and starting experiments with stoneware in 1952. A new stoneware kiln was built and slipware production continued using <b>electric</b> <b>kilns</b> until 1964 when all production switched to stoneware. In 1974 a wood fired kiln was built to replace the oil fired kiln for stoneware production and is still in use.|$|R
50|$|Despite use of some modern {{equipment}} such as an <b>electric</b> <b>kiln</b> for firing {{some types}} of glazes and use of powered throwing wheels, he continued to use traditional methods such as digging his own clay, maintaining a mule to power his pug mill and firing most of his work in a brick kiln. Other Brown family traditions {{include the use of}} a chicken feather to apply some of the glazing patterns, the use of broken pots for teeth in the face jugs, the practice of a two piece method for large vessels and the use of wheel and handshaping techniques for complex pieces instead of slip casting.|$|E
50|$|This {{break from}} {{tradition}} {{may also be}} linked to the exclusion of women from the ceramic arts in Japan. Despite Japan’s long history of ceramic arts, Matsuda’s work may be read as springing from the post-war alternatives to traditional Japanese forms and the apprentice system. As women studied ceramics in universities, they broke from the traditional apprentice system, which created functional and artistic vessels. The apprentice system relegated women to the outskirts of production, from decoration to adding glazes. Women remained {{on the periphery of the}} ceramic world until the educational and material post-war developments of broadly available university and the more common appearance of gas and <b>electric</b> <b>kiln.</b> After World War II, Japanese ceramic work also shifted in more sculptural, experimental, and expressive directions.|$|E
50|$|Cox {{exhibited}} in 1924 at the Tailteann exhibitions, and in 1925 submitted textile designs to the Arts and Crafts Society. She established a pottery studio at 7 Schoolhouse Lane, Dublin, with college friend Stella Rayner in 1929. The studio {{had the first}} <b>electric</b> <b>kiln</b> in Ireland. The first exhibited piece by Cox shown by the Royal Hibernian Academy (RHA) was in 1930, {{with a pair of}} Madonna bookends, and portrait masks of the daughter of Dermod O'Brien, Brigid O'Brien, and writer Norris Davidson. Davidson was a friend and neighbour, who commissioned Cox to design the poster for his 1929 film, Suicide. Cox exhibited with the RHA from 1931 to 1933, and the Tailteann 1932, whilst also holding exhibitions in her studio. During this period Hilda Roberts painted her portrait, Strange Spirit. Kathleen Cox in her studio. The theme of womanhood was prominent in her work, including in the sign of her studio.|$|E
50|$|Finch was {{interested}} in stoneware, and in 1952 he started experimenting with the more difficult clay. The experiments were eventually successful and in 1954 the bottle kiln was fired for the last time, since it was too large and unsuitable for stoneware. Slipware production continued by using <b>electric</b> <b>kilns,</b> but was phased out in 1964. In 1974 the wood fired kiln was built to replace the oil fired kiln for stoneware production and has been used ever since.|$|R
50|$|Malibu Potteries {{built its}} factory on an idyllic location, {{right next to}} the Malibu pier on the sandy beach. To be able to produce large {{quantities}} of tile, Malibu Potteries created an immense kiln which was run on diesel fuel. Their firing process required extensive use of fuel because they fired their tile at 1900° which took 24 hours and which required another full day to cool down With today's technology, there are a wide array of <b>kilns</b> available, especially <b>electric</b> <b>kilns,</b> that can be operated more efficiently and provide greater control.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{handcrafted}} pots {{continued to}} attract attention, {{they could not}} compete in the commercial market. The last firing of the big beehive kiln took place in 1965, and after that smaller gas and later <b>electric</b> <b>kilns</b> were used until the pottery works closed in 1979. Yet the diversified production of the Dorchester Pottery Works {{and the fact that}} it was a family-run operation helped it to stay open longer than other commercial New England potteries such as Bennington, Dedham and Hampshire. Some of its products were: storage jars from 5 to 75 gallons, beanpots both for restaurant and home use, cheese jars, foot-warmers, plates, platters, pitchers, pots, planters, bowls, casseroles, cuspidors, vases, flower baskets, bird baths, Toby jugs, cookie jars, steins, mugs, demitasse cups and saucers as well as special-order custom designs.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to {{approximately}} 1972 {{nearly all the}} products of Dan Kwian kilns were functional vessels. Common forms were water storage jars of around 50 liters capacity, lidded jars for preparing fermented fish, mortars, and basins. There {{is no evidence of}} tableware production at Dan Kwian. Most of the pottery is fired in above-ground anagama-style wood kilns, although at least one noborigama chamber kiln, many gas kilns, and at least one <b>electric</b> <b>kiln</b> have been used in recent years. Ceramic ware in Dan Kwian was traditionally fired in two distinct styles, Phao Dam (Thai:เผาดำ), or [...] "fired black," [...] and Phao Deng (Thai:เผาแดง), [...] "fired red." [...] Phao Dam ware was fired to temperatures between approximately [...] and [...] The ware at this temperature became dark brown and vitreous. Phao Dam wares were prized for durability and lack of porosity. Most notable of these products are the once ubiquitous Dan Kwian water jars.|$|E
5000|$|For example, {{to prevent}} {{access to the}} inside of an <b>electric</b> <b>kiln</b> while it is operating, a trapped key system may be used to {{interlock}} a disconnecting switch and the kiln door. Whenever the kiln power switch is turned on, the key is automatically held by the interlock, and cannot be manually removed. In order to open the kiln door, the power switch must first be turned off, which releases the key and allows it to be removed from the interlock. The key can then be used to unlock the kiln door. While the key is removed from the switch interlock, a plunger from the interlock mechanically prevents the power switch from being turned on. Power cannot be re-applied to the kiln until the kiln door is locked, releasing the key, and the key is then returned to the power switch interlock. A similar two-part interlock system can be used anywhere it is necessary to ensure the energy supply to a machine is interrupted before the machine is entered for adjustment or maintenance.|$|E
50|$|Glass fusing is the {{technique}} used to join glass pieces together by partly melting the glass at high temperature. The fusion process requires multiple pieces of glass, {{with a minimum}} of two. The heating is commonly undertaken in an <b>electric</b> <b>kiln.</b> Instead of fitting glass together using a lead solder, two or more pieces of glass are laid on top of or overlapped on each other and are fired at temperatures ranging from 1100 to 1600 degrees Fahrenheit (750 to 850 degrees Celsius). It is important to realize that glasses with different coefficients of expansion or viscosity cannot be fused together. Upon cooling or after a period of time, the fused piece will crack. Many people who work in glass fusing restrict themselves to one brand of glass (e.g. Bullseye Glass, Uroborus, Baoli, Spectrum) which is guaranteed to be compatible with any other fusible glass offered by that particular maker.Molds can also be used in glass fusion, this is a process called slumping, glass is laid over the mold (generally made of ceramic or metal) and forms to it creating pieces such as plates and candle holders.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>kilns</b> have {{controllers}} with {{a variety}} of sophistication: the simplest is the [...] "Infinity Control", a simple open-loop power regulator. As this only controls power, rather than temperature, such a kiln must be manually controlled throughout the cycle. As firing cycles extend over several hours, potentially days for large architectural pieces, automatic unattended control is obviously important. Automatic temperature control uses a PID controller that maintains a constant set temperature. More sophisticated controllers allow the ramp heating and cooling rates to be controlled too, an important factor in glass heating. Controllers dedicated for glass kiln use have their entire heating cycles defined before use with multiple set temperatures, hold times and ramps between them. The most sophisiticated controllers of all are dedicated to glass use and allow pre-defined cycles such as [...] "Fuse" [...] or [...] "Slump" [...] to be selected from a simple menu, without their operator needing {{to be aware of the}} precise temperatures required.|$|R
50|$|After the Second World War, Belleek Pottery stopped {{production}} of earthenware. The Pottery began {{the change from}} coal fired <b>kilns</b> to <b>electric</b> powered <b>kilns</b> from 1952. In 1983 the Industrial Development Board gave financial assistance to the company and installed Roger Troughton as the Managing Director. The following year Troughton made a successful bid {{for the sale of}} the company. In 1988, Dungannon-based Powerscreen International bought the company, and opened a visitor centre the following year.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} {{an application of}} fuzzy c-means clustering to designing the fuzzy logic controller for the temperature control in <b>electric</b> ceramics <b>kiln.</b> This research aims to controlling the temperature in firing step of burning the ceramic products which were coated with black, intensely red and green chemical substances. The experimental {{results show that the}} fuzzy c-means clustering designed FLC gives better temperature characteristics when compared to the conventional FLC and the hard c-means clustering designed FLC...|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} of the school began on September 30, 1984 and was completed on December 29, 1985. She started classes with 450 students in the Secondary One and Two levels, and a teaching body of 15 on January 3, 1986, headed by the school's first principal, Mr Ow Chiong Hoo. In the same year, the school saw the first Investiture of the BtVSS Student Council, {{the formation of the}} School Military Band and the Library. The school was fully functional with the completion of the outdoor fitness stations and the landscaped garden. In 1987, Bukit View held their first Track-and-Field Meet, and also was the convenor of the West Zone Secondary Schools Badminton Tournament. The school facility also installed an <b>electric</b> <b>kiln</b> installed for students to explore their artistic talents through pottery. On July 15, 1988 Bukit View was officially opened by Mr Chai Chong Yii, MP for Bukit Batok. A school lecture hall was built and officially opened by the newly appointed MP for Bukit Batok Dr Ong Chit Chung on 6 November 1989. In 1997 Bukit View also participated in the 2-day Pesta Sukan National 10's Rugby Tournament for the first time.|$|E
5000|$|It {{is called}} [...] "Trapped Key" [...] as it works by {{releasing}} and trapping keys in a predetermined sequence. After the control or {{power has been}} isolated, a key is released {{that can be used}} to grant access to individual or multiple doors. For example, to prevent access to the inside of an <b>electric</b> <b>kiln,</b> a trapped key system may be used to interlock a disconnecting switch and the kiln door. While the switch is turned on, the key is held by the interlock attached to the disconnecting switch. To open the kiln door, the switch is first opened, which releases the key. The key can then be used to unlock the kiln door. While the key is removed from the switch interlock, a plunger from the interlock mechanically prevents the switch from closing. Power cannot be re-applied to the kiln until the kiln door is locked, releasing the key, and the key is then returned to the disconnecting switch interlock. A similar two-part interlock system can be used anywhere it is necessary to ensure the energy supply to a machine is interrupted before the machine is entered for adjustment or maintenance.|$|E
5000|$|She began {{teaching}} at Montana State University in Bozeman in 1946. The school's Department of Applied Art hired her to teach ceramics. But she did not, at that time, consider herself a ceramicist. [...] "I started teaching ceramics with the merest little scrap of knowledge. I had had just two quarters of ceramics when I started teaching. I just learned it {{right along with}} the class," [...] she later said. Senska decided to build a ceramics program from the ground up. Olga Ross Hannon, the department's head, gave her $300, {{and she and her}} first class of students took over a storeroom in the basement of Herrick Hall, purchased foot-driven potter's wheels, and built an <b>electric</b> <b>kiln</b> from scratch. Continuing to train in ceramics, Senska attended a workshop taught by noted French-American ceramic artist Marguerite Wildenhain at the Pond Farm artists' colony near Guerneville, California, in the summer of 1950. Senska later said that she learned her hand technique from Wildenhain. Her students included a number of influential ceramicists, including Rudy Autio and Peter Voulkos. While teaching at Montana State, Senska met fellow art professor Jessie Spaulding Wilber. The two women became lifelong friends and companions. Senska retired from teaching in 1973.|$|E
5000|$|Kazuo Inamori {{was born}} January 21 1932 in Kagoshima, {{on the island}} of Kyushu in Japan. Inamori {{graduated}} from Kagoshima University in 1955 with a Bachelor of Science degree in applied chemistry. [...] He became a researcher at Shofu Industries in Kyoto, Japan. [...] There he was important in several developments, developing fosterite as an insulator for high frequency radio waves; using fosterite for the mass production of high frequency insulator components; and developing an <b>electric</b> tunnel <b>kiln</b> for use in sintering.|$|R
50|$|His main {{research}} {{field was}} the technical chemistry of ceramic manufacture, chemical processing of ceramics. In 1928 {{he was the}} first to invent and construct an <b>electric</b> tunnel <b>kiln,</b> later on he worked out a new ceramics firing method (what he named 'sandwich firing'). In addition to this he also made extensive researches on thermal insulators and technology of glazed tile manufacture. During the late period of his career he put down the theoretical fundamentals of technical chemistry and successfully adapted mathematical models (e.g. graph theory) to describe chemical processes.|$|R
50|$|Pyroprocessing (from Greek Πυρος = fire) is {{a process}} in which {{materials}} are subjected to high temperatures (typically over 800 °C) in order to bring about a chemical or physical change. Pyroprocessing includes such terms as ore-roasting, calcination and sintering. Equipment for pyroprocessing includes <b>kilns,</b> <b>electric</b> arc furnaces and reverberatory furnaces.|$|R
40|$|The {{creative}} project {{involved the}} exploration and to cone 06 in an development of eight large handbuilt ceramic vessels. False bottoms, double walls, and amorphous forms were constructed inside the vessels and textured with various implements. To create contrast {{on the exterior}} of the forms, a variety of experimental glazes, porcelain slips, and stains were applied. The pieces were then fired <b>electric</b> <b>kiln.</b> After this process, the outer surfaces were manipulated again {{with the use of a}} sandblaster and sandpaper. Each piece created for this project had a particular character and life of its own. A constant factor also remained in the work, which held it together as a whole. Department of ArtThesis (M.

40|$|The color {{modifications}} in Eucalyptus grandis thermally modified wood were investigated. One hundred eighty specimens (10 x 10 x 200 mm) were prepared and thermally modified in an <b>electric</b> <b>kiln</b> for 4 and 8 h at 180 - 240 ºC. The color parameters (L*, a*, b*, C*, h* and &# 916;E) {{were determined by}} the CIE-L*a*b* method on radial and tangential sections of untreated and treated wood. The results indicated the darkening of specimens in the radial and tangential sections. Both sections showed variation of L* between 73 and 30, a* between 9 and 5 and b* between 20 and 8. The thermally modified wood at 180 and 200 ºC showed similar patterns, equally at 220 and 240 ºC. The time of exposure indicated significance just in treatment at 200 ºC...|$|E
30|$|Green tea is a {{beverage}} that {{is produced}} by hot-water extraction of the leaves of tea (Camellia sinensis L.). As the amount of green tea consumption has increased, the importance of using the residue has grown. To address this problem, chemical compositions of two pyrolyzates obtained with an <b>electric</b> <b>kiln,</b> L and G, which {{were obtained from the}} tea leaf product and its hot-water extraction residue, respectively, were examined. Both pyrolyzates were alkaline, in contrast to the acidic pHs that are typical of pyrolyzates from wood materials. The major constituents were nitrogen-containing compounds, which accounted for up to about 70 % (based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry peak area). Caffeine was the main compound in both samples, although it might not be a pyrolysis product but actually sublimates from the samples and then condenses back into the pyrolyzates. Other nitrogen-containing compounds were formed mainly from proteins and amino acids. Acids and phenols, which are typical components in pyrolyzates obtained from wood materials and contribute to acidic pH, were rare in both samples. Other neutral compounds are known as compounds in pyrolyzates from wood materials. The pyrolyzates obtained in this experiment were novel and may have new uses.|$|E
5000|$|Traditionally, Zuni {{women made}} pottery {{for food and}} water storage. They used symbols of their clans for designs. Clay for the pottery is sourced locally. Prior to its extraction, the women give thanks to the Earth Mother (Awidelin Tsitda) {{according}} to ritual. The clay is ground, and then sifted and mixed with water. After the clay is rolled into a coil and shaped into a vessel or other design, it will be scraped smooth with a scraper. A thin layer of finer clay, called slip, {{is applied to the}} surface for extra smoothness and color. The vessel is polished with a stone after it dries. It is painted with home-made organic dyes, using a traditional yucca brush. The intended function of the pottery dictates its shape and images painted on its surface. To fire the pottery, the Zuni used animal dung in traditional kilns. Today Zuni potters might use <b>electric</b> <b>kilns.</b> While the firing of the pottery was usually a community enterprise, silence or communication in low voices was considered essential {{in order to maintain the}} original [...] "voice" [...] of the [...] "being" [...] of the clay, and the purpose of the end product. Sales of pottery and traditional arts provide a major source of income for many Zuni people today. An artisan may be the sole financial support for her immediate family as well as others. Many women make pottery or, less frequently, clothing or baskets.|$|R
5000|$|... 3-D Studio Crew {{maintains}} the 3-D Art Studio areas, including stocking ceramic chemicals, mixing glazes and slips, and loading and firing the <b>electric</b> and gas <b>kilns.</b> Students on this crew might also {{learn how to}} create sculpture and pottery, how to build and maintain kilns and other equipment in a sculpture studio, and how to run and organize a professional 3-D studio.|$|R
50|$|The anagama {{is fueled}} with firewood, in {{contrast}} to the <b>electric</b> or gas-fueled <b>kilns</b> commonly used by most contemporary potters. A continuous supply of fuel is needed for firing, as wood thrown into the hot kiln is consumed very rapidly. Stoking occurs round the clock until a variety of variables are achieved including the way the molten pots look inside the kiln, the temperatures reached and sustained, the amount of ash applied, the wetness of the walls and the pots, etc.|$|R
