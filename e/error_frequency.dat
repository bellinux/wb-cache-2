This method can rapidly amplify minute {{amounts of}} DNA samples to a reasonable quantity for genomic analysis.

To assure the performance and stability of the system, the low <b>frequency</b> <b>error</b> and high <b>frequency</b> <b>error</b> of the optical lens surface must be strictly controlled, the mid-spatial <b>frequency</b> <b>error</b> must also be strictly limited. In this paper, the relationship between empirical mode decomposition-Wigner-Ville distribution (EMD-WVD) method and power spectrum density is analyzed, and EMD-WVD diagnosis method is applied to identifying and locating the mid-spatial <b>frequency</b> <b>error</b> of the precision optical surface. The experimental results show that, with EMD-WVD method, the mid-spatial <b>frequency</b> <b>error</b> distribution of optical surface can be located in 15 - 27 mm and the spatial frequency is 0. 1 mm- 1, the interference of cross-term caused by multi-component signal whose spatial frequency is about 1. 0 - 1. 5 mm- 1 can also be reduced, which enhances the identification accuracy of mid-spatial <b>frequency</b> <b>error...</b>|$|R

50|$|Moreover, {{because the}} {{assembly}} of the full-length gene product relies on the efficient and specific alignment of long single stranded oligonucleotides, critical parameters for synthesis success include extended sequence regions comprising secondary structures caused by inverted repeats, extraordinary high or low GC-content, or repetitive structures. Usually these segments of a particular gene can only be synthesized by splitting the procedure into several consecutive steps and a final assembly of shorter sub-sequences, which in turn leads to {{a significant increase in}} time and labor needed for its production.The result of a gene synthesis experiment depends strongly {{on the quality of the}} oligonucleotides used. For these annealing based gene synthesis protocols, the quality of the product is directly and exponentially dependent on the correctness of the employed oligonucleotides. Alternatively, after performing gene synthesis with oligos of lower quality, more effort must be made in downstream quality assurance during clone analysis, which is usually done by time-consuming standard cloning and sequencing procedures.Another problem associated with all current gene synthesis methods is the high frequency of sequence errors because of the usage of chemically synthesized oligonucleotides. The <b>error</b> <b>frequency</b> increases with longer oligonucleotides, and as a consequence the percentage of correct product decreases dramatically as more oligonucleotides are used.The mutation problem could be solved by shorter oligonucleotides used to assemble the gene. However, all annealing based assembly methods require the primers to be mixed together in one tube. In this case, shorter overlaps do not always allow precise and specific annealing of complementary primers, resulting in the inhibition of full length product formation.Manual design of oligonucleotides is a laborious procedure and does not guarantee the successful synthesis of the desired gene. For optimal performance of almost all annealing based methods, the melting temperatures of the overlapping regions are supposed to be similar for all oligonucleotides. The necessary primer optimization should be performed using specialized oligonucleotide design programs. Several solutions for automated primer design for gene synthesis have been presented so far.|$|E
5000|$|Technical evaluationTo define quantitatively where {{technique}} fails or excels {{has very}} practical uses for coaches, in particular, {{and also for}} sports scientists aiming to analyse performance {{at different levels of}} development of athletes. [...] Winners and errors are powerful indicators of technical competence in racket sports and have often been used in research in notational analysis of net-wall games. It has been found that, for all standards of play in squash, if the winner: error ratio for a particular player in a match was greater than one, then that player usually won. (This was achieved with English scoring and a 19-inch tin). Although this ratio is a good index of technique, it would be better used with data for both players, and the ratios should not be simplified nor decimalised. Rally end distributions, winners and errors in the different position cells across the court, have often been used to define technical strengths and weaknesses. This use of these distributions as indicators is valid as long as the overall distribution of shots across the court is evenly balanced. This even distribution of shots rarely occurs in any net or wall game. Dispersions of winners and errors should be normalised with respect to the totals of shots from those cells. It would be more accurate to represent the winner, or <b>error,</b> <b>frequency,</b> from particular position cells, as a ratio to the total number of shots from those cells. Similarly, performance indicators such as shots are insufficient and need to be expressed with more detail, for example shot to goal ratios (soccer). Even these, powerful as they are, need to be viewed with caution and perhaps integrated with some measure of shooting opportunities? In rugby union, simple numbers of rucks and mauls won by teams may not give a clear impression of the match, the ratio of 'rucks won' to 'rucks initiated' is a more powerful measure of performance. This too could be improved by some measure of how quickly the ball was won in critical areas of the pitch? Many coaches seek the template of tactical play at the highest level for preparation and training of both elite players and/or teams, and also for those developing players who aspire to reach the highest position. Particular databases, aimed at specific individuals or teams, {{can also be used to}} prepare in anticipation of potential opponents for match play. This modelling of technical attainment has been replicated in many sports and form the basis of preparation at the highest levels by the sports science support teams.|$|E

To explore the basis of this phenomenon, we followed a mass (uncloned) culture of one normal strain at 13 stages of its replicative lifespan. We found a progressive tenfold decline in <b>error</b> <b>frequency</b> that was inversely correlated with passage level (r = -. 93, p less than. 001). This could not be ascribed to the slow rates of replication associated with fibroblast senescence because slowing of growth by serum deprivation did not change <b>error</b> <b>frequency.</b> Additionally, terminal mass cultures maintained for 16 wk at saturation density to minimize cell selection did not change <b>error</b> <b>frequency</b> over this time. Error frequencies in 12 individual clones purified from the parental culture did not decline on repeated passage, either remaining constant or, in two clones, rising abruptly three- to five-fold after initial assays. Error frequencies of clones showed a weak inverse correlation with growth vigor but not with the maximum doubling number. We conclude that selective pressures favor more vigorously dividing clones with low protein synthetic error frequencies leading to their predominance in mass cultures...|$|E

40|$|Theoretical {{treatments}} of error feedback in translation {{have revealed that}} two different modes of behavior are possible, depending on the values of certain parameters. In mode I, the <b>error</b> <b>frequency</b> will rise steadily toward randomness, inevitably reaching whatever value is catastrophic for cell survival; the “error catastrophe” theory of aging implicitly assumes this mode of behavior. In mode II, the <b>error</b> <b>frequency</b> will converge to a stable value, {{which may or may}} not have toxic consequences. We have performed an experimental test of the behavior of the translation system in Escherichia coli cells: we altered the system's intrinsic fidelity by means of the error-promoting drug streptomycin, and monitored the kinetics of change in <b>error</b> <b>frequency</b> by means of a specific assay of one kind of mistranslation (incorporation of cysteine into flagellin).

The nonhybridized viral RNA was digested with RNase T 1, and the protected RNA oligonucleotide was purified by gel electrophoresis. The base substitution frequency at the internal G residue was measured by finding the fraction of this RNA oligonucleotide that was resistant to RNase T 1 digestion.

In the absence of SOS induction, vectors carrying the photoproducts were rarely replicated; relative to the lesion-free control, 1. 9 % of vectors carrying the normal (6 - 4) isomer produced plaques, and with the Dewar valence isomer the proportion was 0. 4 %. In SOS-induced cells, these frequencies rose to 22. 1 % and 12. 3 %, respectively. The <b>error</b> <b>frequency</b> of replication past the normal isomer in SOS-induced cells was high; in {{a random sample of}} 185 progeny phage analyzed, 169 (91 %) contained mutations, all of which were targeted.
