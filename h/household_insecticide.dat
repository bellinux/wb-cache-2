40|$|With the {{advancement}} from natural pyrethrins to synthetic pyrethroids, their applications have expanded from <b>household</b> <b>insecticides</b> {{for indoor use}} against sanitary pests to outdoor use for agriculture, forestry, animal health, termite control, and many other pest situations. However, high fish toxicity and development of pyrethroid resistance in some pests have been cited as common shortcomings of pyrethroids. To overcome these pyrethroid problems such as high fish toxicity, Katsuda and fellow scientists invented silafluofen by introducing a silicone atom into the pyrethroidal chemical structure in 1984. In addition to the high insecticidal activity and low mammalian toxicity, this compound features low fish toxicity, chemical stability under sunlight, in the soil and under alkaline environments. These features make silafluofen unique among pyrethroids. In Japan, silafluofen {{has been used as}} an agricultural insecticide for 15 years since 1995 for various plants, especially useful for paddy rice protection because of its low fish toxicity. Over the last 20 years, silafluofen-based termiticides including emulsifiable concentrate (EC) and oil formulations have been widely used in Japan for soil treatment and timber treatments. Additional silafluofen product lines include anti-termitic plastic sheets which are laid under buildings. In this paper, literature on the development of silafluofen and its use in Japan are reviewed. On the other hand, in Thailand, we proceeded with development works of silafluofen-based termiticides from 2005 by starting laboratory efficacy tests and field efficacy tests in Phuket. Both laboratory and field tests showed good efficacy as a soil termiticide, suggesting that the material will perform well for commercial use in high biological hazard environments such as Thailand and can be used in environments close to water where fish toxicity might be a concern with other pyrethroids...|$|R

This paper presents results from a population-based case-control interview study of parents of children less than 15 years of age, which was conducted in the states of West Germany from 1993 to 1997. Cases were 1, 184 children with leukemia, 234 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 940 with a solid tumor; 2, 588 controls were also included. Parental occupational exposures {{were found to be}} related to childhood cancer regardless of the time period of exposure and the type of cancer. This finding might partially be explained by different recall of past exposures by the parents of cases and controls. Residential use of insecticides was associated with childhood lymphoma: both extermination of insects by professional pest controllers (odds ratio (OR) = 2. 6, 95 % confidence interval (Cl) : 1. 2, 5. 7) and frequency of parental use of <b>household</b> <b>insecticides</b> (p for trend = 0. 02) were significant risk factors for this diagnosis.

40|$|In this work, a {{comparison}} between three extraction processes, including traditional maceration in n-hexane and ethyl alcohol, supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and cyclically pressurized extraction known as rapid solid-liquid dynamic extraction (RSLDE), {{has been carried out}} for the extraction of pyrethrins, predominantly nonpolar natural compounds with insecticidal properties found in pyrethrum, an extract of certain species of chrysanthemums. Pyrethrins are often used in <b>household</b> <b>insecticides</b> and for the control of parasites on pets or livestock. Maceration is the cheapest method, but the values of the percent of extracted material compared to the weight of the dried flowers are lower. The extraction with supercritical CO 2 is less efficient than the Naviglio extractor, but it has the advantage of not requiring the use of solvents. Consequently, all three techniques are valid for the extraction of compounds from pyrethrum flowers. The results obtained show that by suitably varying the parameters of the three extraction procedures, it is possible to obtain pyrethrin extracts for use in the production of low toxicity insecticides for warm-blooded animals and low pollution. In particular, extraction with supercritical CO 2 presents an additional advantage; although oleoresin is a natural product, its extraction involves the use of solvents, while SFE is a highly efficient extraction process due to the use of CO 2 in the supercritical phase without the use of solvents. On the other hand, the Naviglio extractor is an inexpensive technique and requires a minimum energy loss when compared to the extraction with supercritical fluids. Thus, the latter is more convenient on an industrial level but is not universally applicable. Nevertheless, the supercritical extraction {{can be used as a}} medium detergent of the oleoresin produced to avoid residues of the solvents left during the extraction process. Therefore, for demonstration purposes, for the SFE CO 2 extraction process, numerical simulations have been performed, allowing for helpful results to optimize the process for further tests...|$|R

The article also demonstrates how data easily collected during an ongoing insecticide spraying campaign in Arequipa might be used to identify children at greatest risk of infection with T. cruzi. The results of the analysis might aid in the optimal use of limited diagnostic resources by targeting screening efforts to those children in greatest need of diagnosis. Such targeted screening could facilitate the integration of diagnosis and treatment of children into Chagas disease control programs currently focused primarily on insects...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} post-harvest {{fisheries}} in Indonesia was undertaken for the Overseas Development Administration, by a fisheries technologist, a biologist, and an economist, during a five week visit in June and July 1988. The {{terms of reference}} were: to review post-harvest fisheries and donors' activities in the sector, and to identify a strategy for future ODA inputs. The marine fishery {{is the most important}} in terms of value, followed by tambak aquaculture (mostly shrimps and milkfish), and the inland capture fishery. Most of the harvest is sold in the domestic market as wet fish, dried fish, and pindang (fish cooked in brine). Exports of frozen shrimp, from the tambaks and the marine fishery, are becoming increasingly important. Additionally, there are exports of wet fish on ice to Singapore. The team considered that the greatest problem facing the sector is overfishing of the South Java Sea, resulting in operational fishing grounds being located at an ever increasing distance from the main markets on Java. This poses a challenge to resource management, both pre- and post-harvest. The former requiring resource surveys, and the latter, the identification of low-cost improvements to on-board handling, to ensure the supply of fish to Java's predominantly low income population. A study encompassing these aspects is proposed by the EC in collaboration with France; ODNRI, in consultation with ODA HO, will liase with the French technical agency (ORSTOM) to determine whether complementary inputs from ODNRI would be useful. A second area in which action is proposed is in reducing losses from insect infestation of sun-dried fish. Dried fish is an important protein source for low-income groups in Indonesia, and an area in which ODA could make an effective contribution. The use of <b>household</b> <b>insecticides</b> on drying fish in Indonesia has been widely publicised and the practice banned. The problem persists though, and the team recommends a follow-up programme to an existing project. The existing project has provided training to the staff of provincial quality control laboratories in loss assessment and reduction, including the use of a safe (and approved) insecticide - Minawet. Financial analysis of the use of Minawet and adoption trials will be undertaken during the final stages of the existing project. Subject to satisfactory results from these, a large-scale extension project is proposed, aimed at adoption of Minawet by fish processors. An additional element will be the provision of the necessary training and equipment in pesticide residue analysis, for the National Centre for Quality Control and Fish Processing...|$|R
