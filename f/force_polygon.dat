40|$|Geometric {{form of a}} {{suspension}} bridge that uses load-sensitive cables takes on not only resisting loads but also becoming a visually sensible shillouette. This study has proposed a preliminary structural form planning for {{a suspension}} bridge following force flow by adopting the two possibilities of the graphic statics. First, the <b>force</b> <b>polygon</b> allows alternative load paths for the same loading condition. Second, a new structural form for the newly developed load path can be constructed using the reciprocal principle that exits between a structure space and the corresponding <b>force</b> <b>polygon.</b> Major structural form parameters that affect both structural and aesthetic aspecs are first identified. The relationships between structural forms and the corresponding force polygons are then investigated for the identified parameters. Upon the investigation, a stepwise process is developed for a preliminary structural form planning for a suspension bridge. The proposed structural form planning method is general {{that can be easily}} expanded to generate design alternatives of similar form-active structural systems. It is also expected that this method will be used as an educational tool to explain th...|$|E

The summation of these pre-tension at each joint should be zero to achieve the self equilibrium structure.

40|$|In the 19 th century it {{was common}} to use {{graphical}} methods for study the relationship between form and force. The central element of all drawing methods for representing the inner flow of forces was {{the investigation of the}} dependence of equilibrium and <b>force</b> <b>polygons,</b> as well as their representation in two geometrically dependent diagrams with different units. This research is part of an on going project to extend the methods of ‘graphical statics’ of Carl Culmann (1866) to the third dimension in order to overcome some of the 2 D-limitations of this approach. It is focused on the construction of resulting force within 3 D and the utilization within discrete space frames (tetrahedrons) in equilibrium. The objective of the EGS is to focus on constructing in contrast to calculating. That means that the logic of the inner force flow leads to a process-oriented and visible approach of design, which gets computationally accessible. With the use of digital tools and increasing importance of performative methods of form-finding a renewed interest in these vector-based geometric methods of construction of force flow has occurred. This may be will give the possibility to get an alternative to the common form finding methods by relaxation processes and analysis by FEM...|$|R

Mathematical modelling is widely used {{in the field of}} biomechanics. The traditional approach to investigate spine related injuries is to check the strength of the components of the spine. Spinal stability approach focuses on the force polygons formed by the body weight, muscle forces, ligament forces and external load. This <b>force</b> <b>polygon</b> is expected to stay within the boundaries of the spine to ensure stability. Proving the possibility of one <b>force</b> <b>polygon</b> within the spine boundaries proves the stability of the spine. This study focuses on the full curvature of the spine for spinal stability investigations in a lifting activity. An experiment has been designed to investigate the postural differences in males and females by measuring the full spinal curvature with a skin surface device. Distributed body weight force, with increased detail of muscle and ligament forces acting on the spine have been modelled by writing a code in Visual Basic, while lifting a load from the boot of a car in the sagittal plane. This model is flexible enough to reflect changes in body weight parameter. Results show that {{there is a difference between}} male and female postures during the full span of lifting activities. Application of individual muscle forces provides greater control of stability at each vertebral level. By considering the elongation of the ligaments and the force requirements of the muscle groups, it is possible to diagnose soft tissue failure. The differences in posture result in different moment arms for muscles and ligaments causing different loading on the spine. Most critical postures have been identified as the fully flexed postures with external load acting on the spine. Conceptual design ideas have been proposed to assist lifting a load from the boot of a car to eliminate the excessive flexion and loading on the spine...|$|E

40|$|Figure 1 shows {{a general}} section through a finite slope. A {{circular}} failure surface {{is assumed to}} form through this slope. The slope is generally nonhomogeneous, i. e., it may be composed of soil materials of different types and characteristics. Let us divide this slope into {{a finite number of}} slices; for example, in Fig. 1 there are 10 slices. Then, we analyze each slice for equilibrium. In general, the number of equations of equilibrium is less than the number of unknowns, leading to a statically indeterminate structure. The degree of indeterminacy increases as the number of slices increases. Hence, we need to make assumptions to be able to solve the problem. The specific assumptions made are features of the specific method; for example, the Fellenius and the modified Bishop methods use different sets of assumptions. In this handout, we will focus our attention on these two methods. 1. Ordinary Method of Slices (OMS) Figure 2 shows a cross section of a slope. Also shown are the free-body diagram and the <b>force</b> <b>polygon</b> for slice i, where 1 ≤ i ≤ n. In the Ordinary Method of Slices (OMS), also known as the Fellenius method, it is assumed that the resultant of the interslice forces E and X is parallel to the base. Since the interslice forces are parallel to the base, we can sum forces perpendicular to the base and eliminate the interslice forces altogether. For slice i, we have Ni = Wi cos αi (1. 1) where Wi is the total weight of slice i and αi is the angle defined in Fig. 2. Case 1. Given (c, φ) Assume that we are given strength parameters c and φ based on total stresses. Then, the maximum possible shear stress that can develop along the base is τf = ci + σi tan φi (1. 2) The maximum shear force is equal to τf multiplied by the area ℓi × 1, or Si,max = ciℓi + Ni tan φi = ciℓi + Wi cos αi tan φi (1. 3) These shear forces produce resisting moments about the point of rotation at C. The expression for the resisting moment takes the form n ∑ (RM = R ciℓi + Wi cos αi tan φi (1. 4) i= 1 where R is the radius of the circle. The driving moment is DM = n...|$|E

40|$|We use Monte Carlo {{methods to}} study the knot {{probability}} of lattice polygons on the cubic lattice {{in the presence of}} an external force f. The force is coupled to the span of the polygons along a lattice direction, say the z-direction. If the <b>force</b> is negative <b>polygons</b> are squeezed (the compressive regime), while positive forces tend to stretch the polygons along the z-direction (the tensile regime). For sufficiently large positive forces we verify that the Pincus scaling law in the force-extension curve holds. At a fixed number of edges n the knot probability is a decreasing function of the force. For a fixed force the knot probability approaches unity as 1 - exp(-alpha(0) (f) n + o(n)), where alpha(0) (f) is positive and a decreasing function of f.

40|$|The melting {{transition}} of two-dimensional (2 D) systems {{is a fundamental}} problem in condensed matter and statistical physics that has advanced significantly {{through the application of}} computational resources and algorithms. 2 D systems present the opportunity for novel phases and phase transition scenarios not observed in 3 D systems, but these phases depend sensitively on the system and thus predicting how any given 2 D system will behave remains a challenge. Here we report a comprehensive simulation study of the phase behavior near the melting {{transition of}} all hard regular polygons with 3 ≤ n≤ 14 vertices using massively parallel Monte Carlo simulations of up to one million particles. By investigating this family of shapes, we show that the melting transition depends upon both particle shape and symmetry considerations, which together can predict which of three different melting scenarios will occur for a given n. We show that systems of polygons with as few as seven edges behave like hard disks; they melt continuously from a solid to a hexatic fluid and then undergo a first-order transition from the hexatic phase to the fluid phase. We show that this behavior, which holds for all 7 ≤ n≤ 14, arises from weak entropic forces among the particles. Strong directional entropic <b>forces</b> align <b>polygons</b> with fewer than seven edges and impose local order in the fluid. These forces can enhance or suppress the discontinuous character of the transition depending on whether the local order in the fluid is compatible with the local order in the solid. As a result, systems of triangles, squares, and hexagons exhibit a KTHNY-type continuous transition between fluid and hexatic, tetratic, and hexatic phases, respectively, and a continuous transition from the appropriate "x"-atic to the solid.

40|$|We {{consider}} self-avoiding lattice polygons, in the hypercubic lattice, as a {{model of}} a ring polymer adsorbed at a surface and either being desorbed by the action of a force, or pushed towards the surface.

For the 2 -dimensional case we have upper and lower bounds on the free energy. We use both Monte Carlo and exact enumeration and series analysis methods to investigate the form of the phase diagram in two dimensions. We find evidence for the existence of a mixed phase where the free energy depends on the strength of the interaction with the adsorbing line and on the applied force...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new analytical technique {{for improving the}} performance prediction of single-phase induction motors, especially capacitor motors. The technique uses the split-phase motor electrical equivalent circuit analysis together with electrical and magnetic parameters whose variation is computed from the equivalent balanced polyphase motor, so that the same magnetic circuit analysis {{can be used for}} both. (The term split-phase is used to cover motors operating from a single-phase supply but with the phase windings split into two orthogonal windings, one of which may have a capacitor in series with it during running or starting.) The technique accounts for the elliptical envelope of the magnetizing field vector and results in improved precision, since the three-phase electromagnetic model is considered to be more precise than the normal split-phase motor analysis. An important result is the computation of vector polygons of flux density for each section of the magnetic circuit, providing a better basis for core loss prediction. The double-frequency torque ripple is also obtained from the stator magnetomotive <b>force</b> and flux-density <b>polygons.</b> Three different electrical equivalent circuit methods for the split-phase motor (based respectively on the cross-field theory, forward- and backward-revolving fields, and symmetrical components) are evaluated to determine the method best suited for incorporating the variation of the circuit parameters from the polyphase magnetic circuit analysis, and it is discussed how the core losses can be included in these circuits to obtain the best overall performance prediction...|$|R

40|$|As glaciers {{are good}} {{indicators}} for the regional climate, {{most of them}} presently undergo dramatic changes due to climate change. Remote sensing techniques {{have been widely used}} to identify glacier surfaces and quantify their change in time. This paper introduces a new method for glacier surface segmentation using solely Airborne Laser Scanning data and outlines an object-based surface classification approach. The segmentation algorithm utilizes both, spatial (x,y,z) and brightness information (signal intensity) of the unstructured point cloud. The observation intensity is used to compute a value proportional to the surface property reflectance – the corrected intensity – by applying the laser range equation. The target classes ice, firn, snow and surface irregularities (mainly crevasses) show a good separability in terms of geometry and reflectance. Region growing is used to divide the point cloud into homogeneous areas. Seed points are selected by variation of corrected intensity in a local neighborhood, i. e. growing starts in regions with lowest variation. Most important features for growing are (i) the local predominant corrected intensity (i. e. the mode) and (ii) the local surface normal. Homogeneity is defined by a maximum deviation of ± 5 % to the reflectance feature of the segment starting seed point and by a maximum angle of 20 ° between surface normals of current seed and candidate point. Two-dimensional alpha shapes are used to derive the boundary of each segment. Building and cleaning of segment polygons is performed in the Geographic Information System GRASS.
