500|$|In 1963 the Doubleday {{publishing}} company asked Haley {{to write a}} book about the life of MalcolmX. American writer and literary critic Harold Bloom writes, [...] "When Haley approached Malcolm with the idea, Malcolm gave him a startled look ..." [...] Haley recalls, [...] "It was one of the few times I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> uncertain." [...] After MalcolmX was granted permission from Elijah Muhammad, he and Haley commenced work on the Autobiography, a process which began as two-and three-hour interview sessions at Haley's studio in Greenwich Village. Bloom writes, [...] "Malcolm was critical of Haley's middle-class status, as well as his Christian beliefs and twenty years of service in the U.S. Military." ...|$|E

500|$|Milk drifted from California to Texas to New York, {{without a}} steady job or plan. In New York City he became {{involved}} with O'Horgan's theater company as a [...] "general aide", signing on as associate producer for Lenny and for Eve Merriam's Inner City. The time he had spent with the cast of flower children wore away much of Milk's conservatism. A contemporary New York Times story about O'Horgan described Milk as [...] "a sad eyed man—another aging hippie with long, long hair, wearing faded jeans and pretty beads". Craig Rodwell read {{the description of the}} formerly uptight man and wondered if it could be the same person. One of Milk's Wall Street friends worried that he seemed to have no plan or future, but remembered Milk's attitude: [...] "I think he was happier than at any time I had <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> in his entire life." ...|$|E
500|$|Edward's {{youngest}} brother, Prince John, {{died at the}} age of 13 on 18 January 1919 after {{a severe}} seizure. John suffered from epilepsy, and Edward, who was 11 years older than his brother and had hardly known him, saw his death as [...] "little more than a regrettable nuisance". He wrote to his mistress of the time that [...] " [...] told [...] all about that little brother, and how he was an epileptic. 's been practically shut up for the last two years anyhow, so no one has <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> except the family, and then only once or twice a year. This poor boy had become more of an animal than anything else." [...] He also wrote an insensitive letter to Queen Mary, which has since been lost. She did not reply, but he felt compelled to write her an apology, in which he stated: [...] "I feel such a cold hearted and unsympathetic swine for writing all that I did... No one can realize more than you how little poor Johnnie meant to me who hardly knew him... I feel so much for you, darling Mama, who was his mother." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite Lloyd George's denials of collaboration, {{the diary}} for 3 December by Northcliffe's factotum Tom Clarke, records that; [...] "The Chief {{returned}} {{to town and}} at 7.00 o'clock {{he was at the}} War Office with Lloyd George." [...] Meanwhile Duff Cooper was invited to dinner at Montagu's Queen Anne's Gate house, he afterwards played bridge with Asquith, Venetia Montagu and Churchill's sister-in-law [...] "Goonie", recording in his diary : [...] "..the P.M. more drunk than I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him,</b> (..) so drunk that one felt uncomfortable… an extraordinary scene." ...|$|E

2500|$|In July 2000, Thompson accidentally {{shot his}} assistant, Deborah Fuller, while {{attempting}} to scare a bear away from her lodging on The Owl Farm. He fired a shotgun at the ground near the bear, and the pellets ricocheted upward, hitting her in the right arm and leg. She {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "I screamed 'You son of a bitch, you shot me.' And poor Hunter. I don't think I had <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> run so fast. He felt horrible." [...] No charges were filed for the incident.|$|E
2500|$|His {{willingness}} to play {{anywhere on the}} pitch has earned him the sobriquet El Ilusionista (The Illusionist), El Cerebro (The Brain), El Anti-Galáctico (a pun on Real Madrid players' nickname Los Galácticos), El Caballero Pálido (The Pale Knight) and most recently Don Andrés from the Spanish press. Zinedine Zidane also praised Iniesta, stating on the Spanish radio station Cadena COPE, [...] "Iniesta really impresses me. He's got so much influence in Spain's game. He reminds me of myself." [...] Fernando Torres, Spain's striker, said, [...] "We've been playing together since we were 15 and I have never, <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> play badly." [...] He {{is widely regarded as}} one of the most respected and best midfielders of all time.|$|E
2500|$|In early May 2012, Astill told Joanne Lowles from TVTimes that he {{was leaving}} the series. He said {{that he was}} pleased with Dan's exit storyline because he [...] "becomes the happiest we've <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him,</b> he's {{comfortable}} in his own skin and relaxed." [...] He later told Digital Spy's Kilkelly that he had [...] "loved" [...] working on the show but wanted to pursue new projects. Although he did not rule out a return in the future. While a BBC representative explained that the dynamic between Dan and Simon Marshall (Paul Nicholls) would develop and result in [...] "Dan having to decide once and for all which path he follows". They added that Astill is a [...] "brilliant actor" [...] and had contributed much to Dan's storylines during his tenure.|$|E
60|$|I have succeeded. For {{two weeks}} I have not <b>seen</b> <b>him.</b> Nor shall I <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> again. I have at last {{attained}} the equanimity of mind necessary for philosophic thought. I wrote a complete chapter to-day.|$|R

6000|$|... "I can't help it, and I don't believe I ever shall. I don't know as {{his being}} dead would help it any. I can't <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> without feeling just as I did at first." ...|$|R
2500|$|Foch met Haig in Paris on 31 May {{and asked}} him to release some US {{divisions}} trained by the British and still under British command, to take over trenches in Alsace so as to free up French divisions. Haig was worried that the Germans would attack his sector again (intelligence reported extra German hospital spaces being made available near La Bassee) - this was indeed the German plan but the offensive in question, [...] "Hagen", was repeatedly postponed and never actually took place. He promised to consider the matter, although he did agree to create a reserve corps of 3 British divisions to serve anywhere on the Western Front. He recorded that Foch was “more anxious” than he had <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him,</b> although Lord Derby, who was also present, recorded that Haig himself seemed “tired and anxious”.|$|E
2500|$|In {{need of a}} {{statement}} game, the 49ers traveled to Seattle for a Thursday Night Football game against their division rivals. During the broadcast on NFL Network, Cris Collinsworth noted {{that if he were}} starting an NFL franchise, he would have taken the Broncos rookie quarterback Jay Cutler before Alex Smith and fellow rookies Matt Leinart and Vince Young – and that Smith was not even close to the others. Going into the 4th quarter, the 49ers were trailing the Seahawks 7–3, and pulling out a win looked unlikely. Smith however performed brilliantly in the fourth quarter, and drove the 49ers on a long touchdown drive down the field early, taking a narrow 10–7 lead. Late in the quarter, with the same score, Smith struck again – shaking off an almost certain sack, rolling to the left and completing a pass to Frank Gore for a touchdown to give the 49ers a 10-point lead. On the next drive, Smith cemented the victory by leading yet another touchdown drive, and rushing for a touchdown on a naked bootleg. Collinsworth had earlier in the game observed that [...] "Alex Smith is the best I've <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him.</b> That drive is the best I saw," [...] and on seeing his touchdown run, commented [...] "What a second-half he has had!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Italians {{had shown}} {{an ability to}} {{co-ordinate}} columns separated by many miles of desert and the British forces had kept their discipline during the retreat and preserved most of their forces. Mussolini boasted that Italy had conquered a territory (British Somaliland, the Sudan area around the border outposts of Karora, Gallabat, Kurmak and Kassala and the area in Kenya around Moyale and Buna) the size of England in the Horn of Africa. News of the evacuation {{came as a shock}} to British public opinion but Wavell backed Godwen-Austen, saying that he had judged the situation correctly. British Somaliland was annexed to Italian East Africa. De Simone wrote that the Italians captured five guns, five mortars, more than a hundred trucks, three Bren gun carriers, 30 anti-tank guns, 71 machine-guns, many small-arms and much ammunition. Winston Churchill criticised Wavell for the loss of British Somaliland; because of the few casualties, Churchill thought that the colony had not been adequately defended and proposed a court of enquiry. Wavell refused to hold an inquiry, called it a textbook withdrawal in the face of superior numbers by Godwin-Austen and Wilson, sending a telegram to Churchill including the passage [...] "...a big butcher’s bill was not necessarily evidence of good tactics". Churchill was said by General John Dill to have been moved by the telegram to [...] "greater anger than he had <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> in before" [...] and that the incident {{was the beginning of the}} end for Wavell.|$|E

6000|$|... "Eustace? Did you <b>ever</b> <b>see</b> <b>him?</b> That {{accounts}} for your question. He only left France {{long enough to}} come over here and make love to her, and he swears he'll never leave it again. If she divorces him, he'll have to have alimony." ...|$|R
