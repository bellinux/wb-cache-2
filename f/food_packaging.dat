When an action figure for Buzz Lightyear and Sheriff Woody was created it was initially ignored by retailers. However, after over 250,000 figures were sold for each character before the film's release, demand continued to expand, eventually reaching over 25million units sold by 2007.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} study the {{relation}} between the <b>food</b> <b>package</b> temperature and ambient environment, the <b>food</b> <b>package</b> temperature is investigated by numerical simulation under the different conditions, such as evaporator outlet velocities, ambient temperatures, and relative humidity. In the present computation, the influence of mass transfer and radiation is considered. The computational results show that the front and top <b>food</b> <b>package</b> temperature rises to 0. 1 ~ 1. 2 °C due to the effect of light. At the investigated range of this paper, the <b>food</b> <b>package</b> temperature decreases when the air curtain velocity increases, but the <b>food</b> <b>package</b> temperature also increases with increase of ambient temperature and humidity. At the same time, the <b>food</b> <b>package</b> temperature decreases 0. 2 ~ 1. 1 °C when air curtain outlet velocity increased by 0. 15 m/s. The <b>food</b> <b>package</b> temperature rises about 0. 6 °C when ambient temperature increases by 2 °C. The <b>food</b> <b>package</b> temperature rises about 0. 9 °C when ambient humidity increases by 20 %.

5000|$|In {{response}} {{to the lack of}} intended program outcomes, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service assigned the Institute of Medicine’s Committee to assess the effectiveness of the <b>food</b> <b>package</b> content. As part of the evaluation, they were to determine the special dietary needs of each subgroup of the WIC participants. This included prioritizing the targeted nutrient intake and offering recommendations for specific changes to the WIC <b>food</b> <b>packages.</b> To do this, the committee was charged with making recommendations that were “culturally suitable, non-burdensome to administration, efficient for nationwide distribution and vendor checkout, and cost-neutral.” [...] These recommendations were implemented in the form of supplemental foods that would counteract the deficiencies and excesses of the WIC <b>food</b> <b>package</b> within the bounds of cost and cultural requirements.This change to the <b>food</b> <b>package</b> was done again in 2009, which put the <b>food</b> <b>package</b> in compliance with the 2005 Dietary Guideline for Americans. This change introduced an inclusion of cash-value vouchers for fruits, vegetables, whole-wheat bread, corn or whole-wheat tortillas, brown rice, oats, bulgur, and barley. Milk purchase options were also altered to only include lower-fat milk for all women and all children over 2 years of age. The adjustment in the <b>food</b> <b>package</b> had a significant effect on participant nutrition.|$|R
5|$|Food is {{essential}} to life. Feeding more than seven billion human bodies takes a heavy toll on the Earth's resources. This begins with the appropriation of about 38% of the Earth's land surface and about 20% of its net primary productivity. Added to this are the resource-hungry activities of industrial agribusiness—everything from the crop need for irrigation water, synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to the resource costs of <b>food</b> <b>packaging,</b> transport (now {{a major part of}} global trade) and retail. Environmental problems associated with industrial agriculture and agribusiness are now being addressed through such movements as sustainable agriculture, organic farming and more sustainable business practices.|$|E
5|$|Sectors of {{the food}} {{industry}} (manufacturing and retail) have pledged {{to reduce the amount}} of food they directly waste, and additionally what they cause households to waste indirectly. This is planned to happen through a combination of: effective labeling, pack size range, storage advice and packaging that extends the duration of food freshness. The latest initiative in May 2009, rather than a new policy, is seen as an expansion to ongoing attempts to reduce the wider <b>food</b> <b>packaging.</b> The aim is to cut UK household food waste by 155,000 tonnes (2.5% of total waste) before the end of 2010 by helping UK households prevent food going to waste.|$|E

40|$|WIC <b>food</b> <b>packages</b> are {{undergoing}} major revisions {{to accommodate the}} unique requirements of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) in the twenty-first century. This dissertation is {{an evaluation of the}} impact of the revised WIC <b>food</b> <b>packages</b> through national-level surveys obtaining data before and after <b>food</b> <b>package</b> changes. In addition, a community-level metabolic/dietary study of obese women consuming either the original or revised <b>food</b> <b>packages</b> was performed. Since WIC has never revamped its entire program before, this is an opportunity to learn more about the impact of the revisions on WIC participants across the country, including Native Americans from Indian Tribal Organizations (ITOs). The National Food and Nutrition food frequency questionnaire (NATFAN) evaluates food and consumption practices of WIC participants, including Native Americans, for both the original and revised WIC <b>food</b> <b>packages.</b> The baseline surveys (NATFAN') were administered before the 2009 rollout of the revised WIC <b>food</b> <b>packages</b> (dates varied by state program). The post-rollout surveys (NATFAN'') were administered spring through winter of 2010 - 2011, and at least six months after the implementation of the revised WIC <b>food</b> <b>packages.</b> Hierarchical linear modeling, with restricted maximum likelihood approximation, was used to evaluate 100 % juice, fruit, and vegetable frequency of consumption based upon NATFAN' and NATFAN'', including samples from states, territories, and ITOs. This research is important because it was national in scope and analyzed nutritional behaviors of a Native American subpopulation of WIC that is seldom documented in national nutrition research. For the metabolic/diet study, obese women 185 % of the poverty level were given the original or revised WIC <b>food</b> <b>packages</b> (n= 3). Three venous blood serum collections (0, 6, 12 weeks) were biomarker tested (cholesterol, glucose, C-reactive protein, etc.) in lipid and metabolic panels. Three, seventy-two hour dietary recalls were also assessed to determine fruit and vegetable consumption changes over the course of the study. This phase was important because it focused on the individual's actual consumption behaviors of specific WIC foods dispensed in the WIC <b>food</b> <b>packages</b> and assessed how such consumption affected the health of the individual...|$|R

VLDPE is most commonly produced using metallocene catalysts due to the greater co-monomer incorporation exhibited by these catalysts. VLDPEs are used for hose and tubing, ice and frozen food bags, <b>food</b> <b>packaging</b> and stretch wrap as well as impact modifiers when blended with other polymers.|$|E
25|$|A carton is {{the name}} of certain types of {{containers}} typically made from paperboard or cardboard.

25|$|Pure {{plastics}} {{have low}} toxicity {{due to their}} insolubility in water {{and because they are}} biochemically inert, due to a large molecular weight. Plastic products contain a variety of additives, some of which can be toxic. For example, plasticizers like adipates and phthalates are often added to brittle plastics like polyvinyl chloride to make them pliable enough for use in <b>food</b> <b>packaging,</b> toys, and many other items. Traces of these compounds can leach out of the product. Owing to concerns over the effects of such leachates, the European Union has restricted the use of DEHP (di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate) and other phthalates in some applications, and the United States has limited the use of DEHP, DPB, BBP, DINP, DIDP, and DnOP in children's toys and child care articles with the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act. Some compounds leaching from polystyrene food containers have been proposed to interfere with hormone functions and are suspected human carcinogens. Other chemicals of potential concern include alkylphenols.|$|E

25|$|The Olympic Park {{was planned}} to {{incorporate}} 45 hectares of wildlife habitat, {{with a total}} of 525 bird boxes, and 150 bat boxes. Local waterways and riverbanks were enhanced as part of the process. Renewable energy also features at the Olympics. It was originally planned to provide 20% of the energy for the Olympic Park and Village from renewable technologies; however, this may now be as little as 9%. Proposals to meet the original target included large-scale on-site wind turbines and hydroelectric generators in the River Thames. These plans were scrapped for safety reasons. The focus has since moved to installing solar panels on some buildings, and providing the opportunity to recover energy from waste. <b>Food</b> <b>packaging</b> at the Olympics is made from compostable materials– like starch and cellulose-based bioplastics– where it cannot be re-used or recycled.
