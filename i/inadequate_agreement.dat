40|$|Excerpt] The U. S. -Colombia {{free trade}} {{agreement}} is the wrong trade model at the wrong time. Instead of helping workers here or in Colombia, the U. S. -Colombia {{free trade agreement}} would reward {{a country with a}} history of extreme violence that has utterly failed to protect workers 2 ̆ 7 rights. This agreement, negotiated by the Bush Administration before the financial meltdown of 2008 and the current unemployment crisis, contains too many flawed trade policies of the past. Instead of wasting valuable time and effort advancing this <b>inadequate</b> <b>agreement,</b> President Obama should instead focus on effective job creation measures (including currency rebalancing, infrastructure investment, and robust training and education) and reforming our trade model (so that it strengthens labor rights protections for all workers, safeguards domestic laws and regulations, and promotes the export of goods rather than jobs) ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{assessed}} the adherence profiles to inhaled therapies and the agreement between two patient self-report adherence methods in stable COPD lpatients from seven Latin American countries. This observational, cross-sectional, multinational, multicenter study involved 795 COPD patients (post-bronchodilator {{forced expiratory volume}} in 1 second/forced vital capacity [FEV 1 /FVC] < 0. 70). Adherence to inhaled therapy was assessed using the specific Test of Adherence to Inhalers (10 -item TAI) and the generic 8 -item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS- 8) questionnaires. The percentage agreement and the kappa index were used to compare findings. 59. 6 % of patients were male (69. 5 ± 8. 7 years); post-bronchodilator FEV 1 percent predicted was 50. 0 ± 18. 6 %. Mean values for 10 -item TAI and MMAS- 8 questionnaires were 47. 4 ± 4. 9 and 6. 8 ± 1. 6, respectively. Based on the TAI questionnaire, 54. 1 % of patients had good, 26. 5 % intermediate, and 19. 4 % poor adherence. Using the MMAS- 8 questionnaire, 51 % had high, 29. 1 % medium, and 19. 9 % low adherence. According to both questionnaires, patients with poor adherence had lower smoking history, schooling but higher COPD Assessment Test score, exacerbations in the past-year and post-bronchodilator FEV 1. The agreement between 10 -item TAI and MMAS- 8 questionnaires was moderate (Kappa index: 0. 42; agreement: 64. 7 %). Suboptimal adherence to medication was frequent in COPD patients from Latin America. Low adherence was associated with worse health status impairment and more exacerbations. There was <b>inadequate</b> <b>agreement</b> between the two questionnaires. Greater effort {{should be made to}} improve COPD patients' adherence to treatment, and assessment of adherence with more specific instruments, such as the TAI questionnaire, would be more convenient in these patients.

5000|$|<b>Inadequate</b> global institutions, <b>agreements</b> or {{networks}} as well {{as political}} and national interests may impede global governance and lead to failures. Such are the consequence of ineffective global governance processes. Qin calls it a necessity to [...] "reconstruct ideas for effective global governance and sustainable world order, which should include the principles of pluralism, partnership, and participation" [...] for a change to this phenomenon.

40|$|Two points {{have been}} raised about the Likelihood Principle (LP). The first relates to the {{definition}} of LP: {{it has been shown that}} one of the two available definitions is hardly acceptable outside a strictly Bayesian context. The cue for the second issue is taken from Birnbaum's proof (and other similar proofs) that the LP - in its strong version - is implied by other more fundamental principles, which most statisticians tend to accept; some of these principles or axioms, after subjection to severe critical discussion, have been recognized as <b>inadequate</b> for general <b>agreement.</b> Moreover, it is shown that Birnbaum's proof - as well as others with the same demonstration structure - is logically false...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} evaluation of a new instrument – the Clinician Suicide Risk Assessment Checklist (CSRAC). The instrument assesses the clinician’s competency in three areas: clinical interviewing, assessment of specific suicide risk factors, and formulating a management plan. A draft checklist was constructed by integrating information from 1) literature review 2) expert clinician focus group and 3) consultation with experts. It was utilised in a simulated clinical scenario with clinician trainees and a trained actor {{in order to test}} for inter-rater agreement. Agreement was calculated and the checklist was re-drafted with the aim of maximising agreement. A second phase of simulated clinical scenarios was then conducted and inter-rater agreement was calculated for the revised checklist. In {{the first phase of the}} study, 18 of 35 items had <b>inadequate</b> inter-rater <b>agreement</b> (60 %>), while in the second phase, using the revised version, only 3 of 39 items failed to achieve adequate inter-rater agreement. Further evidence of reliability and validity are required. Continued development of the CSRAC will be necessary before it can be utilised to assess the effectiveness of risk assessment training programs...|$|R

On 28 December 2015, South Korea and Japan came to an agreement regarding 'comfort women' or abducted Korean women who were forced to work as sex-slaves for Japanese soldiers. Representatives of colleges and citizens however, declared this <b>agreement</b> <b>inadequate.</b> Eunhye Choi, president of the student body of Ewha Women's University said that: [...] "The voice of the victims was excluded" [...] and [...] "There wasn't an apology from Japan. It is a disgraceful agreement. Comfort women victims desired to be made clear about responsibility for forced mobilized labour at national level, formal apology, legal compensation, recording on textbook and punishment. So that the same thing and victim would not occur again in this land." ...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{have been}} undertaken for the film-blowing process of viscoelastic fluids under different operating conditions. Viscoelasticity {{is described by}} an integral constitutive equation of the K-BKZ type with a spectrum of relaxation times, which can fit the experimental data well for the shear and extensional viscosities and the normal stresses measured in shear flow. Nonisothermal conditions are considered by applying the Morland-Lee hypothesis, which incorporates the appropriate shift factor and pseudo-time into the constitutive equation. The momentum and energy equations are expressed in the machine direction only by using a quasi-one-dimensional approach introduced earlier by Pearson and Petrie. The resulting system of differential equations is solved using the finite {{element method and the}} Newton-Raphson iterative scheme. The method of solution was first checked against the Newtonian and Maxwell results for various film characteristics given earlier. The simulations are compared with available experimental data and previous simulations in terms of film shape, velocity, stresses, and temperature. The present results show that the existing modeling of force balances is <b>inadequate</b> for quantitative <b>agreement</b> with the experimental studies. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
40|$|CONTEXT: Success in the {{practice}} of pathology demands proficiency in management, but management training for pathology residents is generally <b>inadequate,</b> with little <b>agreement</b> on an appropriate curriculum or competency assessment. Most residency training programs do not have faculty members who are interested and have expertise in management and who are dedicated to and have time available for teaching. OBJECTIVE: To develop a didactic management training program for the residents from 6 separate pathology residency programs in Southern California, with a comprehensive curriculum taught by experts in each area without undue burden on any single training program. METHODS: Faculty from the University of California-Los Angeles and the University of Southern California reviewed the literature and the management needs of practicing pathologists and devised the curriculum. Pathologist and nonpathologist speakers were identified who were working in important management positions both regionally and nationally. Seminars were presented in alternate months during a 2 -year period. Sessions were videotaped, and each session was evaluated by the attendees. RESULTS: The curriculum consisted of 12 major topics, and seminars were delivered by 15 presenters from 6 institutions. Attendance was highest for residents in postgraduate years 2 and 3. The overall evaluation scores were exceedingly high (4. 66 of a possible 5. 0), and residents reported a significant increase in subject knowledge. Videotaping of presentations provided flexibility for residents who were unable to attend the seminars. CONCLUSION: This program was effective and could serve as a template for other pathology residency training programs to establish curriculum content and develop resident competency. Teaching responsibilities were less burdensome when spread among several programs and when supplemented by nonpathology faculty. Electronic and audiovisual support enhanced flexibility and access to the program...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a study of the supply of financial services to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). A major objective of the study is to document the experiences of providers of financial services to SMEs worldwide, with particular emphasis on identifying innovative business models that can generate financial and social returns. The methodology employed follows the ‘value chain’ approach in that investment processes are analysed and factors facilitating or constraining the fluidity of the chain are identified. The underlying barriers to financing SMEs in Africa can be classified into four types related to: (1) risks involved; (2) institutional development; (3) policy and regulatory frameworks; and (4) skills and training needs. Particular difficulties’ in the fisheries sector include: Information Asymmetry i. e. promoters lack business acumen to fully articulate their ventures to funders; but financiers lack expertise in appraising fisheries projects. Establishing a venture fund is challenging and lengthy; as is accessing local capital. Limited incubation and lack of project preparation facilities that assist fisheries and aquaculture entrepreneurs to develop their ideas into bankable deals limit the pool from which investors can mine potential fisheries and aquaculture investments. Global financiers in SMEs are currently implementing innovative financial models for sustainable enterprises. One key characteristic of investment funds specialising in SMEs in Africa is that they combine investment funds with business development funds in order to ensure the economic growth of SMEs as well as the likelihood of prompt loan repayment. Innovative financial models for SMEs seek to fill the gap between traditional banking and grant-based donor finance. Hybrid business models that can leverage the best aspects of philanthropy and business can help build sustainable, scalable enterprises. The delivery of investment and business development for SMEs can be done directly or through intermediaries. Other forms of innovation include utilizing SME purchase agreements as collateral; specialised financial intermediaries and multilateral agencies acting as co-lenders and risk-sharing of loans to SMEs; and industry partners assisting to develop the economic growth of SMEs and ensuring market access. Lending institutions and investment funds by and large follow a process which can be likened to that of a value chain. The importance of identifying key steps in the lending or investment process and the associated facilitating or constraining factors becomes evident when dealing with SMEs particularly in Africa. Lending institutions, Credit Guarantee Schemes (CGSs) and Private Equity Funds (PEFs) follow pre-determined cycles. This is highlighted in the cases studies in the report. Numerous challenges in finance for SMEs exist. Bureaucracy, actual or perceived, and a lack of awareness about SMEs have been identified as serious barriers to the successful reaching of SMEs. Existing relations are crucial to the lending relationship between SMEs and local financial intermediaries, especially when new products are introduced or for speedy approvals. Appropriate monitoring and performance measurement metrics, which are important in a social business model such as a Fund for SMEs in the fisheries sector are lacking. Country-specific legal regulations are cumbersome for regional funds. In a rapidly changing environment, maintaining the alignment of stakeholders’ interests is critical. Business development support from a group of talented management professionals with knowledge of financial accountability, operations, and international/national markets in the fisheries sector – in order to serve as advisors and talent-enablers to SMEs is crucial. Financial returns and exact exit structure are rarely known or guaranteed. Key interventions to help increase financial access by companies in the sector include: (1) Exit strategies; (2) Incubation facilities; (3) Business Angels; (4) Funds of funds; and (5) Policy and regulatory reforms. The key intervention is to promote financial market growth in Africa to address exit strategy challenges such as small African capital exchanges, Restriction on Listing of Foreign Companies, Share Buyback Restriction and <b>Inadequate</b> Double Taxation <b>Agreements.</b> The business incubation sphere in Africa is very young and underdeveloped compared to other developing countries in the world. SMEs in Africa can also benefit from the formation of business angel networks in combination with the establishment of incubators and investment funds. Amendments to stringent policies that hinder access to key sources of local capital in Africa today are essential e. g. restrictions on illiquid investments by pension funds and insurance companies, which can serve as investment vehicles targeting SMEs...|$|R
