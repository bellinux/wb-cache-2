40|$|Estimates of <b>design</b> <b>floods</b> are {{required}} {{for the design of}} hydraulic structures and to quantify the risk of failure of the structures. Many international studies have shown that <b>design</b> <b>floods</b> estimated using a regionalised method result in more reliable estimates of <b>design</b> <b>floods</b> than values computed from a single site or from other methods. A number of regional flood frequency analysis (RFFA) methods have been developed, which cover all or parts of South Africa. These include methods developed by Van Bladeren (1993), Mkhandi et al. (2000), Görgens (2007) and Haile (2011). The performance of these methods has been assessed at selected flow-gauging sites in the province of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa. It is recommended that the limitations of available flow records to estimate extreme flow events need to be urgently addressed. From the results for KZN the JPV method, with a regionalised GEV distribution with the veld zone regionalisation, generally gave the best performance when compared to <b>design</b> <b>floods</b> estimated from the annual maximum series extracted from the observed data. It is recommended that the performance of the various RFFA methods needs to be assessed at a national scale and that a more detailed regionalisation be used in the development of an updated RFFA method for South Africa...|$|R

40|$|A reevaluation of <b>design</b> <b>floods</b> for dam safety {{within the}} united states showed that the need to modify dams to {{accommodate}} larger floods has greatly increased in recent years. The occurrence of larger <b>design</b> <b>floods</b> would result in overtopping of the dams at many existing reservoirs due to insufficient storage or release capacity. When the addition of storage or release capacity becomes impractical or too costly, dam owners must sometimes resort to providing overtopping protection. An ASCE Hydraulics Division Task committee on Alternatives for Overtopping Protection for Dams was established in 1991 to inventory and evaluate modification alternatives for new, innovative spillway designs and overtopping protection concepts for dams. Results of this task committee are being prepared for publication by ASCE during late 1992.

POT model has better flexibility describing floods and the flood generating process than AMS model; thus is suitable for flood frequency analysis under changing environment. Threshold selection approaches are applied to choose the threshold value, which is tested by the relationship of estimated results of parameters of the POT model and <b>designed</b> <b>floods</b> with changing thresholds afterwards. The POT samples are fitted by the generalized Pareto (GP) distribution with a Poisson model for arrival. Compare POT model based on the GP distribution and AMS model based on the P-III distribution and discuss whether the frequent occurrence of large return period flood is influenced by undue frequency analysis method(the large return period flood-prone by the undue influenced of the frequency analysis). The results show that, threshold selected by combined approaches is able to ensure the sample independence and stability of the POT model. When estimating the <b>designed</b> <b>flood</b> peak of large return period, result estimated by the AMS model based on P-III distribution is smaller than the POT model based on GP distribution, the 100 -year flood is estimated {{that the results of}} differences greater than 6 %, visible AMS model underestimate of the phenomenon of large return period <b>designed</b> <b>flood</b> peak, {{which is one of the}} reasons of the frequent occurrence of large return period floods in recent years. </span...|$|R

40|$|A {{common type}} of water storage {{structures}} is the embankment reservoir and levees. But, during the 19 th century, numerous embankment dams failed in Europe and North-America (Table 1 - 1, Fig. 1 - 1). The two most common causes of failures were dam overtopping and cracking in the earthfill. The former was often caused by inadequate spillway facility. The latter resulted {{from a combination of}} bad understanding of basic soil mechanics, poor construction standards, and piping at the connection between bottom outlet and earth material. In recent years, the <b>design</b> <b>floods</b> of a number of dams were re-evaluated and the revised flows were often larger than those used for the original designs. In many cases, the occurrence of the revised <b>design</b> <b>floods</b> would result in dam overtopping because of the insufficient storage and spillway capacity of the existing reservoir. In recent years, a number of overtopping protection systems were developed for embankments and earthfill dams. These include concrete overtopping protection systems, timber cribs, sheet-piles, riprap and gabions, reinforced earth, Minimum Energy Loss weirs, embankment overflow stepped spillways and the precast concrete block protection systems developed by the Russian engineers. After a brief discussion of the embankment overtopping breach process, several overflow protection systems are presented and detailed in the next paragraphs...|$|R
