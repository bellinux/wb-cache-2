40|$|This paper {{presents}} a computational {{study of the}} change of the logic-based concepts to arithmeticbased concepts in inductive learning from examples. Specifically, we {{address the problem of}} learning concepts whose description in the original knowledge representation space is very complex and difficult to learn using a conventional machine learning approach. By detecting &quot;exclusive-or &quot; patterns in the initially created hypotheses, the system postulates symmetry relations among pairs of initial attributes. The symmetry pairs are then combined into maximal symmetry groups. Each symmetry group leads to a creation of a counting attribute which is added as a new dimension to the representation space. So modified representation space facilitates the determination of new type of concept descriptions, called conditional M-of-N rules. The proposed ideas are illustrated by a visualization method based on the <b>generalized</b> <b>logic</b> <b>diagram</b> (GLD) ...|$|E

40|$|Control {{function}} verification is {{an important}} task in current engineering design. Traditional researches usually focus on the final function validation when the control system has already been implemented on a hardware controller. However, {{it would be more}} useful if design errors are found in earlier stages of design. <b>Logic</b> <b>diagram,</b> as a popular middle medium, plays a critical role in the current design practices, especially for medium-sized and large-sized control systems. Therefore, verification of the design specifications of the <b>logic</b> <b>diagrams</b> is an interesting topic in order to find and eliminate the design errors in an early stage. In this thesis, we provide a viable approach to verify the design functions of the <b>logic</b> <b>diagrams</b> which is based on the modular supervisory control of Discrete-Event Systems. We create models for basic logic gates and introduce buffers to obtain automaton representation of <b>logic</b> <b>diagrams</b> After converting the informal verbal specifications to automata, we can verify whether the <b>logic</b> <b>diagram</b> satisfies these specifications with the help of TTCT (a computer program based on automata for analysis and design of supervisory control systems). A formal proof of controllability and a semi-formal proof of nonblocking property are given. An industrial-sized example is studied to demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology...|$|R

40|$|Ambipolar {{devices have}} been {{reported}} in many technologies, including carbon nanotube field effect transistors (CNTFETs). The ambipolarity can be in-field controlled with a second gate, enabling the design of <b>generalized</b> <b>logic</b> gates with a high expressive power, i. e., the ability to implement more functions with fewer physical resources. Reported circuit design techniques using <b>generalized</b> <b>logic</b> gates show an improvement in terms of area and delay with respect to conventional CMOS circuits. In this paper, we characterize and study the power dissipation of <b>generalized</b> <b>logic</b> gates based on ambipolar CNTFETs. Our results show that the logic gates in the generalized CNTFET library dissipate 28 % less power on average than a library of conventional CMOS gates. Further, we also perform logic synthesis and technology mapping, demonstrating that synthesized circuits mapped with the library of ambipolar logic gates dissipate 57 % less power than CMOS circuits. By combining the benefits coming from the expressive power of <b>generalized</b> <b>logic</b> and from the CNTFET technology, we demonstrate that we can reduce the energy-delay-product by a factor of 20 × using the ambipolar CNTFET technology. 1...|$|R
40|$|Logic {{programs}} {{are an important}} knowledge representation tool. In many cases, definite logic {{programs are}} too restricted to formalize problems intuitively. Therefore definite logic programs have been extended in several ways by additional syntactic constructs such as negation and disjunction. A very expressive program class are <b>generalized</b> <b>logic</b> programs. Their rules may contain any quantifier free formula in both their body and head. Definite, normal and disjunctive logic programs are special cases of <b>generalized</b> <b>logic</b> programs. Constraint logic programming, defined in [4], extends definite logic programs by constraints: logical expressions that describe special properties of the problem domain. The combination of these two extensions defines the syntax of <b>generalized</b> <b>logic</b> programs with constraints (�ÄÈ �). Declarative semantics provides a mathematically precis...|$|R

Technology <b>Logic</b> <b>Diagram</b> documents published for the DOE facilities in Oak Ridge (K- 25, X- 10, Y- 12) were chosen for this effort because of the large number of technologies identified, described, evaluated, and ranked for possible use in the environmental remediation of these facilities.

The distinctive features of our conception of diagrammatic reasoning are made clear by comparing it with the model-theoretic conception of ordinary reasoning developed in the mental model theory...|$|R
