5|$|<b>Gills</b> are adnate with a decurrent tooth (where the <b>gills</b> curve up to {{join the}} stipe but then, close to the stipe, the margin turns down again), and {{initially}} narrow but broaden when old. They are pallid to grayish-olive with bright orange edges. Smith noted that the edge color may spread to the gill faces in some specimens, because the pigment, rather than being encrusted {{on the walls of}} the cystidia, is found in the cytosol and therefore more readily diffusible. The <b>gills</b> are spaced close together, with between 16 and 26 <b>gills</b> reaching the stipe, and there are up to three tiers of interspersed lamellulae (short <b>gills</b> that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stipe).|$|E
5|$|Epicoxal hypothesis: This theory {{suggested}} that a possible origin for insect wings {{might have been the}} movable abdominal <b>gills</b> found in many aquatic insects, such as on naiads of mayflies. According to this theory these tracheal <b>gills,</b> which started their way as exits of the respiratory system and over time were modified into locomotive purposes, eventually developed into wings. The tracheal <b>gills</b> are equipped with little winglets that perpetually vibrate and have their own tiny straight muscles.|$|E
5|$|Fish are cold-blooded, and {{in general}} their body {{temperature}} {{is the same as}} that of their surroundings. They gain and lose heat through their skin and during respiration and are able to regulate their circulation in response to changes in water temperature by increasing or reducing the blood flow to the <b>gills.</b> Metabolic heat generated in the muscles or gut is quickly dissipated through the <b>gills,</b> with blood being diverted away from the <b>gills</b> during exposure to cold. Because of their relative inability to control their blood temperature, most teleosts can only survive in a small range of water temperatures.|$|E

5|$|Frog larvae {{are known}} as tadpoles and {{typically}} have oval bodies and long, vertically flattened tails with fins. The free-living larvae are normally fully aquatic, but the tadpoles of some species (such as Nannophrys ceylonensis) are semi-terrestrial and live among wet rocks. Tadpoles have cartilaginous skeletons, <b>gills</b> for respiration (external <b>gills</b> at first, internal <b>gills</b> later), lateral line systems and large tails that they use for swimming. Newly hatched tadpoles soon develop gill pouches that cover the <b>gills.</b> The lungs develop early and are used as accessory breathing organs, the tadpoles rising to the water surface to gulp air. Some species complete their development inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs. These larvae do not have <b>gills</b> but instead have specialised areas of skin through which respiration takes place. While tadpoles do not have true teeth, in most species, the jaws have long, parallel rows of small keratinized structures called keradonts surrounded by a horny beak. Front legs are formed under the gill sac and hind legs become visible a few days later.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the branchiostegal lung, the coconut crab has an additional rudimentary set of <b>gills.</b> Although these <b>gills</b> are comparable in number to aquatic species from the families Paguridae and the Diogenidae, they are reduced in size and have comparatively less surface area.|$|E
5|$|In the Filibranchia and Eulamellibranchia, {{water is}} {{drawn into the}} shell from the {{posterior}} ventral surface of the animal, passes upwards through the <b>gills,</b> and doubles back to be expelled just above the intake. In burrowing species, there may be two elongated, retractable siphons reaching up to the seabed, one each for the inhalant and exhalant streams of water. The <b>gills</b> of filter-feeding bivalves are known as ctenidia and have become highly modified to increase their ability to capture food. For example, the cilia on the <b>gills,</b> which originally served to remove unwanted sediment, have become adapted to capture food particles, and transport them in {{a steady stream of}} mucus to the mouth. The filaments of the <b>gills</b> are also much longer than those in more primitive bivalves, and are folded over to create a groove through which food can be transported. The structure of the <b>gills</b> varies considerably, and can serve as a useful means for classifying bivalves into groups.|$|E

5|$|Most fish {{exchange}} gases using <b>gills</b> {{on either}} side of the pharynx. <b>Gills</b> consist of threadlike structures called filaments. Each filament contains a capillary network that provides a large surface area for exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide. Fish exchange gases by pulling oxygen-rich water through their mouths and pumping it over their <b>gills.</b> In some fish, capillary blood flows in the opposite direction to the water, causing countercurrent exchange. The <b>gills</b> push the oxygen-poor water out through openings in the sides of the pharynx. Some fish, like sharks and lampreys, possess multiple gill openings. However, bony fish have a single gill opening on each side. This opening is hidden beneath a protective bony cover called an operculum.|$|E
5|$|Most {{molluscs}} {{have only}} one pair of <b>gills,</b> or even only one gill. Generally, the <b>gills</b> are rather like feathers in shape, although some species have <b>gills</b> with filaments on only one side. They divide the mantle cavity so water enters near the bottom and exits near the top. Their filaments have three kinds of cilia, one of which drives the water current through the mantle cavity, while the other two help to keep the <b>gills</b> clean. If the osphradia detect noxious chemicals or possibly sediment entering the mantle cavity, the gills' cilia may stop beating until the unwelcome intrusions have ceased. Each gill has an incoming blood vessel connected to the hemocoel and an outgoing one to the heart.|$|E

5|$|The abdomen {{consists}} of ten segments, {{some of which}} may be obscured by a large pair of operculate <b>gills,</b> a thoracic shield (expanded part of the prothorax) or the developing wing pads. In most taxa up to seven pairs of <b>gills</b> arise from the top or sides of the abdomen, but in some species they are under the abdomen, and in a very few species the <b>gills</b> are instead located on the coxae of the legs, or the bases of the maxillae. The abdomen terminates in a pair of, or three, slender thread-like projections.|$|E
5|$|The larvae {{that emerge}} from the eggs, known as tadpoles (or {{occasionally}} polliwogs), typically have oval bodies and long, vertically flattened tails.

5000|$|Many {{of the genera}} {{also have}} a gland {{situated}} in the <b>gill</b> cavity called a [...] "gill gland", a secondary sex characteristic found in sexually mature male glandulocaudines that is apparently suited to release chemical signals. No genus contains species that have glands and other species without glands. This <b>gill</b> gland is derived from anterior <b>gill</b> filaments of the first <b>gill</b> arch. Gland size and degree of <b>gill</b> modification varies with species. Though the true function of the <b>gill</b> glands {{has yet to be}} determined, they are probably used to release chemical signals into the <b>gill</b> current.|$|R

5|$|The {{skin of a}} teleost {{is largely}} {{impermeable}} to water, and the main interface between the fish's body and its surroundings is the <b>gills.</b> In freshwater, teleost fish gain water across their <b>gills</b> by osmosis, while in seawater they lose it. Similarly, salts diffuse outwards across the <b>gills</b> in freshwater and inwards in salt water. The European flounder spends most of its life in the sea but often migrates into estuaries and rivers. In the sea in one hour, it can gain Na+ ions equivalent to forty percent of its total free sodium content, with 75 percent of this entering through the <b>gills</b> and the remainder through drinking. By contrast, in rivers there is an exchange of just {{two percent of the}} body Na+ content per hour. As well as being able to selectively limit salt and water exchanged by diffusion, there is an active mechanism across the <b>gills</b> for the elimination of salt in sea water and its uptake in fresh water.|$|E
5|$|All sharks {{need to keep}} {{water flowing}} over their <b>gills</b> {{in order for them}} to breathe, however not all species need to be moving to do this. Those that are able to breathe while not {{swimming}} do so by using their spiracles to force water over their <b>gills,</b> thereby allowing them to extract oxygen from the water. It has been recorded that their eyes remain open while in this state and actively follow the movements of divers swimming around them and as such they are not truly asleep.|$|E
5|$|Another {{similarly}} colored Russula is R.nigricans, {{which can}} be distinguished from R.densifolia by its darker cap and widely spaced <b>gills.</b> Another lookalike, R.dissimulans, has a dry cap surface, and a mild taste. R.albonigra stains directly to black when injured, and has a taste reminiscent of menthol. R.densifolia is often confused with R.acrifolia, but the latter's <b>gills</b> do not change color when bruised. R.adusta, found with conifers, has a less acrid taste, and its cut flesh changes to light pink rather than red.|$|E
