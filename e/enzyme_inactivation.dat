For the enzyme cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (CGTase), this mechanism is believed to be irreversible unfolding.

Thermal inactivation of β-galactosidase was investigated in a wheat flour/water system at varying temperature-moisture content combinations, and in bread during baking at 175 or 205 °C. In the wheat flour/water system, the thermostability of β-galactosidase increased with decreased moisture content, and a kinetic model was accurately fitted to the corresponding inactivation data (R 2 = 0. 99). Interestingly, the residual enzyme activity in the bread crust (about 30 %) was hundredfold higher than that in the crumb (about 0. 3 %) after baking, despite the higher temperature in the crust throughout baking.
