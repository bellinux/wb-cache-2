40|$|Public {{authorities}} have traditionally used an official language style in public, but currently social media {{have become an}} outlet for humour. This article uses positioning analysis to discuss challenges that use of humour poses for the identity of public organizations. Drawing on interviews with communications professionals working in the emergency services sector, the article suggests six evaluative themes that factor into organizational identity construction, such as the frequency and type of humour in social media posts. Indeed, while humour helps fashion more flexible and risk-taking organizational identities, it can also stand contrary to a bureaucratic ethos of public servantship and equal treatment. Dilemmas thus arise for public authorities that seek {{to adjust to the}} times and still remain ‘in character’. The article contributes to organizational identity research by considering the hitherto overlooked immersion of social media use, humour and organizational identity <b>formation.</b> <b>Funding</b> Agency: Research Council of Norway and its programme Societal Security (SAMRISK II) </p...|$|R

40|$|Major {{histocompatibility}} complex class II (MHC-II) molecules bind to and display antigenic peptides {{on the surface}} of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). In the absence of infection, MHC-II molecules on APCs present self-peptides and interact with CD 4 + T cells to maintain tolerance and homeostasis. In the thymus, self-peptides bind to MHC-II molecules expressed by defined populations of APCs specialised for the different steps of T-cell selection. Cortical epithelial cells present peptides for positive selection, whereas medullary epithelial cells and dendritic cells are responsible for peptide presentation for negative selection. However, few data are available on the peptides presented by MHC molecules in the thymus. Here, we apply mass spectrometry to analyse and identify MHC-II-associated peptides from five fresh human thymus samples. The data show a diverse self-peptide repertoire, mostly consisting of predicted MHC-II high binders. Despite technical limitations preventing single cell population analyses of peptides, these data constitute the first direct assessment of the HLA-II-bound peptidome and provide insight into how this peptidome is generated and how it drives T-cell repertoire <b>formation.</b> <b>Funded</b> by: Spanish Ministry of Education.

40|$|The {{chemical}} {{basis of}} the blue-black to pink-orange color change on cooking of lobster, due to thermal denaturation of an astaxanthin-protein complex, alpha-crustacyanin, in the lobster carapace, {{has so far been}} elusive. Here, we investigate the relaxation of the astaxanthin pigment from its bound enolate form to its neutral hydroxyketone form, as origin of the spectral shift, by analyzing the response of UV-vis spectra of a water-soluble 3 -hydroxy- 4 -oxo-beta-ionone model of astaxanthin to increases in pH, and by performing extensive quantum chemical calculations over a wide range of chemical conditions. The enolization of astaxanthin is consistent with the X-ray diffraction data of beta-crustacyanin (PDB code: 1 GKA) whose crystals possess the distinct blue color. We find that enolate formation is possible within the protein environment and associated with a large bathochromic shift, thus offering a cogent explanation for the blue-black color and the response to thermal denaturation and revealing the chemistry of astaxanthin upon complex <b>formation.</b> <b>Funding</b> Agencies|Bildungs- und Kultur-departement des Kantons Luzern, Switzerland; Swedish Research Council; Olle Engkvist Foundation; Nuffield Foundation; School of Chemistry, University of Manchester; European Molecular Biology Laboratory</p...|$|R
