It was then owned by Reynaldo Bruno Pracchia who exhibited it throughout the 1970s and included it in his Championship Class Grand Prix winning exhibit at London 1980. He sold it in 1986 to the David Feldman firm along with other items and in 1987 it was bought at a Feldman auction by Paulo Comelli for Angelo Lima who also won awards with it.

40|$|Isyaku MohammedDepartment of Ophthalmology, Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, Kano, NigeriaBackground: Treatment of {{recurrent}} pterygium associated with symblepharon usually {{involves the use}} of tissue grafting and/or the intraoperative application of mitomycin C (MMC). For the graft, a conjunctival/limbal autograft and/or amniotic membrane may be used. This generally requires extra technical skills and assistance, an increase in the cost and duration of surgery, and a more extensive anesthesia (a complete <b>eye</b> <b>block</b> or general anesthesia). Although widely used, safety concerns have been raised over MMC in the treatment of pterygia. Objective: The objective of this case report is to report the successful use of preoperative subconjunctival injection of low-dose (0. 02 %) MMC one month before bare sclera excision of a multirecurrent pterygium, as well as the concomitant intraoperative application of MMC to the conjunctival fornix of the same eye after the excision of an associated symblepharon. Case report: A 31 -year-old man from Kano, Northern Nigeria, presented to the eye clinic with a recurrent pterygium associated with an upper lid symblepharon in his right eye. He has had five previous pterygium excisions, with the last surgery involving conjunctival autografting and subconjunctival steroid injection. He was subsequently given 0. 1 mL of 0. 02 % MMC as a subpterygial injection; one month later he had an alcohol-assisted bare sclera pterygium excision and a symblepharolysis with the intraoperative application of 0. 02 % MMC for 1 minute to the upper conjunctival fornix. Except for a Tenon granuloma that was simply excised, there has been no recurrence or other complications up to a year after surgery. Conclusion: As a cheaper and technically easier treatment option, a preoperative subconjunctival MMC injection followed by bare sclera pterygium excision was found to be effective in this patient with a recurrent pterygium. As at one-year follow-up, low-dose preoperative MMC a month prior to surgery also appeared safe and effective when combined with its intraoperative application to the conjunctival fornix for the treatment of associated symblepharon.

40|$|Scorpions {{are largely}} solitary, nocturnal arachnids that glow a bright cyan-green under UV light. The {{function}} of this fluorescence is a mystery. Previous studies of four species from three families {{have shown that}} scorpion lateral and medial eyes are maximally sensitive to green light (around 500 nm) and secondarily to UV (350 - 400 nm). Scorpions are negatively phototactic, and we used this behaviour to assay the responses of desert grassland scorpions, Paruroctonus utahensis, to 395 nm UV light, 505 nm cyan-green light, 565 nm green light and no light within small, circular arenas. Based on the eye sensitivity data, we predicted maximal response to 505 nm, followed by lower responses to 395 and 565 nm. In our experiments, however, scorpions responded most intensely (abrupt bouts of locomotory activity) to 395 nm and 505 nm. Next, we ran trials under 395 and 505 nm on scorpions with their <b>eyes</b> <b>blocked.</b> Scorpions with <b>blocked</b> <b>eyes</b> were {{much less likely to}} move under 505 nm than under 395 nm and were much less likely to move under 505 nm than were control animals (those without their <b>eyes</b> <b>blocked).</b> These results suggest an active role for fluorescence in scorpion light detection. Other studies indicate that photosensitive elements in scorpion tails are sensitive to green light. We therefore propose that the cuticle may function as a whole-body photon collector, transducing UV light to cyan-green before relaying this information to the central nervous system. Scorpions may use this information to detect shelter, as blocking any part of the cuticle could diminish the signa...|$|R

40|$|Howard D Palte Department of Anesthesiology, Perioperative Medicine and Pain Management, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, FL, USA Abstract: In {{the past}} decade {{ophthalmic}} anesthesia has witnessed a major transformation. The sun has set on the landscape of ophthalmic procedures performed under general anesthesia at in-hospital settings. In its place a new dawn has ushered in the panorama of eye surgeries conducted under regional and topical anesthesia at specialty eye care centers. The impact of the burgeoning geriatric population is that {{an increasing number of}} elderly patients will present for eye surgery. In order to accommodate increased patient volumes and simultaneously satisfy administrative initiatives directed at economic frugality, administrators will seek assistance from anesthesia providers in adopting measures that enhance operating room efficiency. The performance of <b>eye</b> <b>blocks</b> in a holding suite meets many of these objectives. Unfortunately, most practicing anesthesiologists resist performing ophthalmic regional blocks because they lack formal training. In future, anesthesiologists will need to <b>block</b> <b>eyes</b> and manage common medical conditions because economic pressures will eliminate routine preoperative testing. This review addresses a variety of topical issues in ophthalmic anesthesia with special emphasis on cannula and needle-based blocks and the new-generation antithrombotic agents. In a constantly evolving arena, the sub-Tenon’s block has gained popularity while the deep angulated intraconal (retrobulbar) block has been largely superseded by the shallower extraconal (peribulbar) approach. Improvements in surgical technique have also impacted anesthetic practice. For example, phacoemulsification techniques facilitate the conduct of cataract surgery under topical anesthesia, and suture-free vitrectomy ports may cause venous air embolism during air/fluid exchange. Hyaluronidase is a useful adjuvant because it promotes local anesthetic diffusion and hastens block onset time but it is allergenic. Ultrasound-guided <b>eye</b> <b>blocks</b> afford real-time visualization of needle position and local anesthetic spread. An advantage of sonic guidance is that it may eliminate the hazard of globe perforation by identifying abnormal anatomy, such as staphyloma.
