2500|$|The Truth in Lending Act of 1968 (TILA) {{resulted}} in honest reporting of effective APRs {{for more than}} a decade. [...] Then in the 1980s, auto makers (and providers of some other durable goods) began to exploit a loophole in the Act and its implementing regulations. Since the Act does not precisely define [...] "Finance Charge" [...] or [...] "Total Sale Price" [...] (terms used in the TILA disclosures), auto makers found they could reduce Finance Charges and increase car price as much as they wanted, provided Total Sale Price was not changed. APRs calculated with the reduced, or eliminated, <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> became the [...] "below market rate" [...] and [...] "Zero percent APR' loans that were commonly advertised for the next 30 years. [...] "Zero percent APR or $1,000 rebate" [...] is {{the most common form of}} these deceptive loans. [...] The [...] "rebate" [...] is the hidden <b>finance</b> <b>charge,</b> reclassified to car price. [...] If the consumer doesn't accept the [...] "zero percent loan," [...] then he or she does not accrue the extra $1,000 interest on that loan, and this $1,000 is represented as a [...] "rebate." [...] In reality, there is no rebate and no [...] "zero percent loan." ...|$|E
2500|$|On November 1, 1974, the Iowa {{attorney}} general, Richard C. Turner, filed {{a petition}} with the District Court, requesting a permanent injunction enjoining the Omaha bank and a Des Moines bank from assessing or collecting a <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> {{in excess of}} the amount permitted by the Iowa Consumer Credit Code. [...] The court ruled in favor of the defendants. In 1977, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed the judgment of the District Court in the Fisher case, saying that First National's card program should not be restrained or restricted in any way because it [...] "promotes and facilitates, rather than limits or inhibits, interstate trade and commerce.|$|E
2500|$|For example, if a user had a $1,000 {{transaction}} and repaid it in full {{within this}} grace period, {{there would be}} no interest charged. If, however, even $1.00 of the total amount remained unpaid, interest would be charged on the $1,000 from the date of purchase until the payment is received. The precise manner in which interest is charged is usually detailed in a cardholder agreement which may be summarized {{on the back of the}} monthly statement. The general calculation formula most financial institutions use to determine the amount of interest to be charged is (APR/100 x ADB)/365 x number of days revolved. Take the annual percentage rate (APR) and divide by 100 then multiply to the amount of the average daily balance (ADB). [...] Divide the result by 365 and then take this total and multiply by the total number of days the amount revolved before payment was made on the account. Financial institutions refer to interest charged back to the original time of the transaction and up to the time a payment was made, if not in full, as a residual retail <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> (RRFC). Thus after an amount has revolved and a payment has been made, the user of the card will still receive interest charges on their statement after paying the next statement in full (in fact the statement may only have a charge for interest that collected up until the date the full balance was paid, i.e. when the balance stopped revolving).|$|E

50|$|For a 12-month loan, 12/78s of the <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> is {{assessed}} as {{the first}} month’s portion of the <b>finance</b> <b>charge,</b> 11/78s of the <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> is assessed as the second month’s portion of the <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> and so on until the 12th month at which time 1/78s of the <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> is assessed as that month’s portion of the <b>finance</b> <b>charge.</b> Following the same pattern, 24/300 of the <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> is assessed {{as the first}} month’s portion of a 24-month precomputed loan.|$|E
50|$|The Rule of 78s {{deals with}} precomputed loans, which are loans whose <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> is {{calculated}} before the loan is made. <b>Finance</b> <b>charge,</b> carrying charges, interest costs, {{or whatever the}} cost of the loan may be called, can be calculated with simple interest equations, add-on interest, an agreed upon fee, or any disclosed method. Once the <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> has been identified, the Rule of 78s is used to calculate the amount of the <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> to be rebated (forgiven) in the event that the loan is repaid early, prior to the agreed upon number of payments. It should be understood that with precomputed loans, a borrower not only owes the lender the principal amount borrowed, but the borrower owes the <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> as well. If $10,000 is lent and the precomputed <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> is $3,000, the borrower owes the lender $13,000 at the time the loan is made, whereas a simple interest borrower owes the lender only the $10,000 principal and monthly interest on the unpaid principal.|$|E
50|$|In United States law, a <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> is any fee {{representing}} {{the cost of}} credit, or the cost of borrowing. It is interest accrued on, and fees charged for, some forms of credit. It includes not only interest but other charges as well, such as financial transaction fees.

50|$|The {{earliest}} official {{use of the}} Rule of 78s {{to calculate}} the unearned portion of a loan’s <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> was in Indiana in 1935.

5000|$|The TILA {{introduced}} the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) calculation mandated for all consumer lenders. Certain misleading interest rate calculations used previously, mainly on auto loans, were barred. For {{more than a}} decade, consumer loans were reported by APR in an economically meaningful way. Then in the 1980s the auto manufacturers began to exploit a loophole in TILA and its administration. Neither the Act nor its administrators adequately differentiated between [...] "amount financed" [...] and [...] "finance charges," [...] two terms that appear on the TILA required disclosure statements. By [...] "bundling" [...] {{the price of the}} car and its <b>financing</b> <b>charges</b> (which come from the auto maker's captive finance company), auto makers were able to shift money between the two categories, even to eliminating the <b>financing</b> <b>charge</b> entirely. Thus [...] "zero percent APR" [...] financing was born.|$|R
5000|$|Initially, signed {{copies of}} sales drafts were {{included}} in each customer's monthly billing statement for verification purposes—an industry practice known as [...] "country club billing". By the late 1970s, however, billing statements no longer contained these enclosures, but rather a summary statement showing posting date, purchase date, reference number, merchant name, and the dollar amount of each purchase. At the same time, many issuers, particularly Bank of America, {{were in the process}} of changing their methods of <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> calculation. Initially, a [...] "previous balance" [...] method was used—calculation of <b>finance</b> <b>charge</b> on the unpaid balance shown on the prior month's statement. Later, it was decided to use [...] "average daily balance" [...] which resulted in increased revenue for the issuers by calculating the number of days each purchase was included on the prior month's statement. Several years later, [...] "new average daily balance"—in which transactions from previous AND current billing cycles were used in the calculation—was introduced. By the early 1980s, many issuers introduced the concept of the annual fee as yet another revenue enhancer.|$|E
