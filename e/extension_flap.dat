40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made in}} the NACA 7 by 10 foot wind tunnel to find the increase in maximum lift coefficient which could be obtained by providing a model wing with both a Fowler trailing-edge <b>extension</b> <b>flap</b> and a Handley Page type leading-edge slot. A conventional Handley page slot proportioned to operate on the plain wing without a flap gave but a slight increase with the flap; so a special form of slot was developed to work more effectively with the flap. With the best combined arrangement the maximum lift coefficient based on the original area was increased from 3. 17, for the Fowler wing, to 3. 62. The minimum drag coefficient with both devices retracted was increased in approximately the same proportion. Tests were also made with the special-type slot on the plain wing without the flap. The special slot, used either with or without the Fowler flap, gave definitely higher values of the maximum lift coefficient than the slots of conventional form, with an increase of the same order in the minimum drag coefficient...|$|E

50|$|Another {{important}} {{design feature}} of the flap system {{is that there is}} no noticeable change in pitch trim with the <b>extension</b> of the <b>flaps.</b> This has been achieved by the incorporation of a simple interconnect system which applies bias to the elevator trim springs when the flap are extended.|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{viability}} of any pedicled flap depends upon its vascularity. When a flap is dissected it becomes relatively ischaemic. Ultimately, the {{viability of}} the flap depends on the vessels incorporated in the pedicle and their perfusion capacity. There are different techniques to evaluate the blood supply of a flap. Aims: This study deals with experimental and clinical efficiency of fluorescein dye technique to evaluate the vascularity of flaps of various compositions. Materials and Methods: The experimental study was conducted on rats to standardize the technique. Thereafter clinical evaluation was conducted for different flaps namely fasciocutaneous, skeletonized perforator based fasciocutaneous, adipofascial, fasciocutaneous <b>flap</b> with adipofascial <b>extension,</b> fasciocutaneous <b>flap</b> with fascial <b>extension</b> and fasciocutaneous <b>flap</b> with split fascial extension. Conclusions: The paper deals in detail with the technique and method of documentation of a fluorescein study on flaps both experimentally and clinically. The appearance of fluorescein on both the surfaces and distal margin of the flap confirmed the adequacy of vascularity soon after dissection of the flaps. It was found to be an easy, safe and reliable objective method...|$|R

50|$|Aircraft {{that need}} control at extreme angles of attack are {{sometimes}} {{fitted with a}} canard configuration, in which pitching movement is created using a forward foreplane (roughly level with the cockpit). Such a system produces an immediate increase in pitch authority, and therefore a better response to pitch controls. This system is common in delta-wing aircraft (deltaplane), which use a stabilator-type canard foreplane. A disadvantage to a canard configuration compared to an aft tail is that the wing cannot use as much <b>extension</b> of <b>flaps</b> to increase wing lift at slow speeds due to stall performance. A combination tri-surface aircraft uses both a canard and an aft tail (in addition to the main wing) to achieve advantages of both configurations.|$|R
40|$|Large {{and deep}} defects in foreheads are best {{repaired}} with flaps. In {{these types of}} cases, reconstructions are made through the transfer of distant flaps, due to {{the small amount of}} available local tissue. The supraclavicular island flap (SCIF) has been extensive used for head and neck reconstructions during the last two decades. However, the <b>flap</b> <b>extension</b> is limited to the reconstruction of the superior third of the face, which may increase the risk of distal flap necrosis. The authors describe two cases of forehead reconstruction with the SCIF using a microsurgical technique...|$|R
30|$|In {{unilateral}} cases, a U-shaped {{skin flap}} was based inferiorly, made {{wide enough to}} allow adequate exposure, while a bicoronal incision was made in cases with bilateral <b>extension.</b> Bone <b>flap</b> was designed to allow adequate tumor exposure; dural opening was performed to be beyond {{the edges of the}} lesion and based on SSS. After dural opening, careful dissection of dura from the underlying cortex was done with a special attention to preserve all draining veins. Internal debulking of the lesion was started followed by dissection of the external capsule of the lesion from the surrounding brain tissue. Tumor parts attached to falx or SSS were the last portion to be removed, in cases where these parts were adherent to the falx cerebri or SSS without invading its cavity coagulation with bipolar was done. In cases with sinus invasion, resection of the tumor within the cavity and sinus wall was done; cases with dural invasion were subjected to duroplasty using fascia lata graft.|$|R

50|$|The {{availability}} of carbon fibre at affordable prices {{has allowed the}} manufacture of light and economical spans exceeding 15 metres.

The trend towards turbo and self-launching sailplanes also favours the 18 metre span, which {{is large enough to}} carry the additional weight of the power unit without impairing the ability to climb in weak lift.|$|R

It is expected to improve the maneuvering capability by providing reduced drag at high lift coefficients without appreciably affecting the low lift drag.

40|$|The {{attitude}} control of an aircraft is usually fulfilled {{by means of}} thrusters at high altitudes. Therefore, {{the possibility of using}} also aerodynamic surfaces would produce the advantage of reducing the amount of fuel for the thrusters to be loaded on board. For this purpose, Zuppardi already considered some aerodynamic problems linked to the use of a wing flap in a previous paper. A NACA 0010 airfoil with a trailing edge flap of 35 % of the chord, in the range of angle of attack 0 - 40 deg and flap deflections up to 30 deg was investigated. Computer tests were carried out in hypersonic, rarefied flow by a direct simulation Monte Carlo code at the altitudes of 65 and 85 km of Earth Atmosphere. The present work continues this subject, considering the same airfoil and free stream conditions but two <b>flap</b> <b>extensions</b> of 45 % and 25 % of the chord and two flap deflections of 15 and 30 deg. The main purpose is to compare the influence of the flap dimension with that of the flap deflection. The present analysis is carried out in terms of: 1) percentage variation of the global aerodynamic coefficients with respect to the no-flap configuration, 2) increment of pressure and heat flux on the airfoil lower surface due to the shock wave-shock wave interaction with respect to the same quantities in no-flap configuration, 3) flap hinge moment. Issues 2) and 3) are important for the design of the mechanical and thermal protection system and of the flap actuator. Even though the flap deflection is aerodynamically more effective than the <b>flap</b> <b>extension,</b> tests verify that using a smaller deflection angle involves the advantage of a smaller increment of pressure and heat flux on the airfoil lower surface as well as a smaller hinge moment...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} investigates the {{influence}} of three-dimensional aerodynamic effects on a wind turbine rotor blade with trailing edge flap by means of CFD. Different <b>flap</b> <b>extensions</b> in chord and radial direction have been analyzed on the DTU 10 MW rotor blade with a flap centered at 75 % radius and for steady deflection angles of +/- 10 ̊. The comparison to 2 D airfoil simulations at mid flap position shows that vortices which develop at the flap edges have a significant influence on the aerodynamic characteristics. They reduce the lift increase or decrease caused by the flap deployment and thus the flap effectiveness. Reductions up to 35 % lift variation {{have been found in}} the the present study which confirms the necessity to consider these 3 D effects in the flap design process...|$|R
50|$|The crew {{suggested}} {{instead that}} an actuator on the #7 slat had failed, causing its inadvertent deployment. The NTSB rejected this as improbable and attributed the <b>extension</b> of the <b>flaps</b> to the deliberate {{actions of the}} crew. The crew claimed that such failures had happened on other 727s prior and subsequent to this incident. The NTSB report noted that between 1970 and 1973, seven separate cases involving a single leading edge slat extension and separation were reported, {{but none of these}} reports indicated whether or not the slat extension was due to flight crew involvement. Records after 1974 did include this information, and (other than Flight 174) only two slat extension problems were reported between 1974 and the close of the NTSB's investigation in 1981, one of which was inadvertently caused by the flight crew.|$|R
50|$|The short primary runway (20R/2L), {{coupled with}} the local noise restrictions, can require a takeoff at or near full power (95-97% power). Some {{aircraft}} departing from the airport may cycle to full power while holding at the runway then release the brakes when engines are fully spooled up (shortfield procedure). On operations from runway 20R a steep climb may also be required {{to allow for a}} power reduction at about 500 to(-) 700 ft for a quieter overflight over the city of Newport Beach. For 20R departures, a left turn after departure to 175 degrees allows for a passage over Newport Beach {{within the confines of the}} noise abatement profile. Departures from 2L (normally during Santa Ana wind conditions) are not affected by these noise abatement procedures. Landings almost always include full <b>flap</b> <b>extensions,</b> and the use of full reverse thrust.|$|R
40|$|Force {{tests have}} been made of {{airplane}} configurations tith a thin swept wing incorporating several wing-contour modiffcations forward of maximum thickness, Roth longitudinal and lateral characteristics are presented. The basic wing had an aspect ratio of 3, a taper ratio of 0. 4, a leading-edge sweep of 45 O, and an NACA 64 AOO 6 aErfoi 1 section normal to the quarter-chord line. The four principal modifications con-sisted of increases in leading-edge radius, and in two caseB, elight forward camber. In two cases, the modified airfoil sections were con-stant over the span, while in the other two, they varfed spantise from thin-nosed sections at the root to maximum modifications at the tip. A fifth modification, tested briefly, consisted of an abrupt change of section at 4. 0 -percent semiepan. The detailed derivation of all modifi-cations is indicated. The complete a-lane configuration consisted of the wing, a body, either of two vertical tails, and an all-movable horizontal tail, which could be tistalled at various heights relative to the wing chord plane. Tests were made with and without the empennage componente, and, in addition, the basic wing was tested alone, without the body.

30|$|The first {{description}} of a technique for closing oroantral fistula using a full-thickness palatal flap based on greater palatine artery dates back to Ashley [15]. Advantages of the palatal flap include high vascularity, generous thickness, and quality of tissue. Moreover, this flap is more resilient, less prone to infection, very resistant to lacerations, and {{does not lead to}} lowering of the vestibule. However, the most significant disadvantages are flap necrosis [15], exposed bony surface, pain, and development of surface irregularities as a result of secondary epithelialization post operatively [2]. In 1980, Ehrl employed this technique with wide fistulas of 1  cm in diameter [16]. The technique consists of excising the epithelium from its edges and incising the palatal fibro-mucosa so as to create a flap with a posterior base, supplied by the greater palatine artery. The anterior <b>extension</b> of the <b>flap</b> must be wide enough to exceed the diameter of the bony defect and long enough to allow lateral rotation. Tension-free suturing should be performed [8].|$|R
30|$|Nakajima et al. [14] {{proposed}} a pedicle design {{that included the}} lesser saphenous vein, based on research into the peripheral vascular network of the limbs. They found in their study that the lesser saphenous vein in the flap not only improves the venous outflow and the circulation of the flap, but it also allows cranial <b>extension</b> of the <b>flap</b> over the proximal third of the calf. The flap size depended on where it was raised in clinical practice. The nutrient vessels of the lesser saphenous vein and the lateral sural nerve show a close anastomosis with the perforators in surrounding fascias, which leads to an affluent and multidimensional vascular network in the lower leg, as demonstrated by our study. Skin areas supplied by extraterritorial flow were elusive. Therefore, it was a risk to pursue a larger flap blindly, whereas protecting the perforator or terminal branch of the peroneal artery over the lateral malleolus and bringing it into the pedicle was a safer approach in the procedure.|$|R

30|$|Soft tissue {{dehiscence}} around {{dental implant}} has frequently been observed {{and it may}} lead to poor oral hygiene, especially around crowns that exhibit contours with prominent convexity. The present case demonstrates a peri-implant mucosal dehiscence coverage with modified semilunar coronary positioned flap (CPF) in # 15 and 16. A semilunar partial-thickness incision was performed 7 – 10 mm apical from the facial gingival margin. Then, intrasulcular partial-thickness incision was tunneled to the semilunar incision. The tunnel preparation was extended interproximally under each papilla due to improvement of <b>flap</b> <b>extension.</b> Then, the tunneled flap was coronary positioned with a coronary-anchored suturing technique. Sub-epithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) from the palate was inserted from the semilunar incision {{to the inside of}} the coronary positioned flap and sutured to stabilize the SCTG and supplemental site. Significant mucosal gain was achieved without any complication. The soft tissue volume was maintained at 9 months post-surgery, and the cleanability was improved. This technique has the potential in improving the graft survival and mucosa gain around implants.|$|R

They are complex problems, with amortality rate of 8. 1 to 14. 8 percent despite flap closure. For closure, the pectoralis major flap has had considerable success. However, in providing coverage {{to the lower}} third of the sternum, it may be deficient.

Ailerons were capable of rotating through +13/-26°, and were used together with the flaps in low-speed flight and in takeoff.Its capabilities were significantly greater than its predecessor, the SM.79, with over 1,850 kW (2,800 hp) available and a high wing loading that gave it characteristics not dissimilar to a large fighter.The engines fitted to the main bomber version were two 750 kW (1000 hp) IAR K14 radials, equipped with variable-pitch, all-metal three-bladed propellers. Speeds attained were around 430 km/h (270 mph) at 4,250 m (13,940 ft), with a relatively low practical ceiling of 6,500 m (21,330 ft).

40|$|The flow angles {{calibration}} of air-data {{systems is}} based on the availability of high-accuracy reference measurements of angle-of-attack and sideslip angles. Typically, these are obtained by auxiliary sensors directly providing the reference angles (e. g., nose-boom vanes) or by analytically reconstructing them using calibrated airspeed measurements and inertial data. This paper proposes a novel approach in which the reference data for the flow angles calibration are obtained by inertial measurements only. The methodology, aiming to lower the development costs of advanced aircrafts, is developed and validated with reference to the triple-probe air-data system of a Piaggio Aerospace Medium Altitude Long Endurance Unmanned Aerial System. Specific flight tests are carried out for the calibration process, by defining maneuvers that reduce flight time and facilitate the calibration itself. The technique is made of two steps: first, the aloft wind speed is estimated, and the angle-of-attack and sideslip angles are reconstructed; next, the reference data are used to define the calibration polynomials via least-mean squares approximation.

A method is developed to predict static pressure errors from analysis of differential pressure measurements from a Rosemount model 858 differential pressure air velocity probe.
