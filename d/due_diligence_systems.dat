The EUTR is part of the EU’s Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan, with its specific goal to end illegal logging, thereby improving sustainability of forest resources.

In 2013, the first year of the EUTR, there are positive impacts, of which the most important is awareness of the disastrous situation with illegal logging, driven by exports of illegal timber. Another positive development is tropical timber exporters documenting the legality of their wood exports. Yet another positive feature is establishment of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> <b>systems</b> by EU importers. However, there are considerable problems to ensuring legal trade. For example, China exports primary- and secondary-processed hardwood products to Europe, based on imported logs which most often do not have comprehensive documentation of their origin and legality.

40|$|The {{trade of}} illegal timber, often from illegal logging, has severe environmental, social and {{economic}} consequences. The EU’s response to this problem came with the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan, with its specific goal to end illegal logging, thereby improving sustainability of forest resources. In March 2013, an additional step was taken by implementing the EU Timber Regulation (EUTR). The EUTR requires proof of timber’s origin and legality {{to ensure that no}} illegal timber is imported into the EU. To this end the EU intends to block imports of any wood or wood product which comes from unknown sources.

40|$|This study uses a company’s <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> <b>system</b> (DDS) as an {{operational}} tool {{to ensure the}} origin of wood coming from northwestern Russia. The company exports a majority of its wood products to European Union (EU) countries, and its DDS consists of a statement of origin, geographical information, and field verification audits. Its DDS is assessed against the European Union Timber Regulation (EUTR). Enforcement of the EUTR began in March 2013 and is compulsory for all companies importing wood-based material from outside the EU. The DDS must contain three key components: access to information on operator’s supply of timber or timber products placed on the market, a risk assessment, and a risk mitigation method. The workflow of the conformity assessment must include a literature review, statistical and field data collection, and further analysis of the requirements. Although enforcement of the EUTR began almost two years ago, there is little research on its implementation. This DDS system showed high functionality of its existing components corresponding with the general requirements of the standards developed by the Nature Ecology and People Consult (NepCon), a non-profit organization recognized as the monitoring organization by the European Commission. This wood origin system also meets {{the requirements of the}} Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification system, while maintaining full harmonization with the EUTR legislation.

This paper looks very closely at this process, {{based on the}} authors’ case study at a university in Scotland where 12 patents or inventors were selected for scrutiny. The study focuses on the actors involved and the decision-making processed used by this university regarding exploitation of its portfolio of patents. The findings show that the actors involved were the inventors themselves, industry, and the university’s Technology Transfer Office (TTO), or any two of these parties.

The decision to commercialise patents via licensing to established companies, however, was made individually {{by one or more}} of the three actors involved. The significant difference in the latter instance was that the inventors were not motivated to be entrepreneurs, and were unwilling to take risks in a new business venture. The findings also show that the TTO did not have a special <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> <b>system</b> to help inventors identify commercial opportunities. The lack of skills, capabilities, and marketing efforts on the part of the TTO in all sectors resulted in the decision to form spin-offs that were based on the inventors’ motivation and industry experience...|$|R
40|$|This explorative study aims to {{shed light}} on the ways in which Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) {{certification}} interacts with the implementation of the EU Timber Regulation (EUTR) in Romania. To this end, the EUTR implementation process is examined, and the relationship between this implementation and FSC certification is explored. There is a particular focus {{on the extent to which}} certification has helped companies to comply with EUTR requirements. The study uses the analytical framework of Transnational Business Governance Interactions (TBGI) and a mixed research approach. It is found that FSC certification has to a large extent helped companies to prepare for and align with the EUTR’s requirements, in particular concerning risk assessment and risk mitigation procedures needed for a <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> <b>system</b> (DDS), and in the context of a “policy vacuum” period related to EUTR implementation. Moreover, recent changes in the FSC standard make it theoretically in line with EUTR requirements. However, difficulties remain in relation to the lack of information, costs and bureaucracy associated with both EUTR implementation and FSC certification. Notably, in the absence of a monitoring organization, the establishment of a viable DDS is still problematic as many companies remain unprepared for developing their own systems. Finally, the EUTR and its risk management requirements may have partly fueled the increase in uptake of chain of custody (CoC) certification in Romania. However, due to the risk of CoC certificates including illegally sourced timber, this recent uptake in certification does not necessarily indicate improved sustainable forest management (SFM) or full compliance with EUTR...|$|R

This paper {{is based on a}} case study of a university in Scotland with 12 patents or inventors were selected. The findings showed that the actors involved in the decision to patent were: inventors, industry and the Technology Transfer Office (TTO), or between two of the above parties. However, the decisions to commercialise via spin-off formations were influenced by factors such as how they recognised the opportunities of their technologies such as through industrial working experiences, and the motivation factors to see their inventions being exploited. On the other hand, for patents those were licensed to established companies, the decisions to exploit through licensing to established companies either came from the decision of the three actors individually or joint decisions between them. The significant difference is that for the patents that were exploited via licensing to established companies, the inventors did not have the motivation to be an entrepreneur, and were not wiling to take risks in a new business venture.

The risk associated with transactions partly depends {{on the extent to}} which the insight into the target company actually holds true. <b>Due</b> <b>diligence</b> is performed to eliminate this information asymmetry. <b>Due</b> <b>diligence</b> is an audit conducted prior to the planned transaction. It can be described as a purposeful and systematic investigation of business opportunity and risk during on-going sale negotiations. The importance of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> is emphasized widely in the academic literature as well as among M&A practitioners. On the other hand, researches and practitioners have differing views on what and how much is enough for a <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> audit. Therefore, this study examines the role of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> in a cross-border acquisition process. The main objective of the research is fulfilled by examining the reasons for conducting <b>due</b> <b>diligence,</b> recognizing the elements affecting effective <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> and analyzing the need and opportunities for enhancing the utilization of <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> For the empirical part of this qualitative study five expert interviews were conducted among experienced Finnish acquirers and advisors. In addition, five expert interviews conducted for a distinct study were utilized as a secondary source of data. The results of this study present fundamental reasons for conducting <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> However, conducting <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> is not always self-evident. Doubtful attitude towards <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> exists, though it is exceptional. Carefully planning the focus of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> and compiling and managing the team conducting <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> are identified as the main elements affecting effective <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> Altogether, <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> can have plural roles which in this study are categorized as the confirmatory, preparative, and cross-functional roles of <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> The older academic literature tends to emphasize the confirmatory role whereas the current academic discussion also supports the preparative role of <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> It can be argued that the roles of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> differ among experienced <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> practitioners based on several factors.

40|$|Information system (IS) in {{the company}} (hereinafter {{referred}} to as organization) is a broader term, which apart from Information Communication Technology (ICT) defines how users should use technology {{and how they can}} interact with technology in delivering day-to-day business activities and support processes within the organization. We can say that IS encompasses ICT, users, processes, data, events and activities in a particular organization or environment. Nowadays the majority of organizations face the issues of ICT governance. In order to obtain effective information on the status of ICT or IS in general, organizations can perform IS <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> activities. Islovar - Informatics Terminology Dictionary defines this term as an analysis of a particular area of business in the organization in order to provide the management or client with real information on the reviewed segment. In the past two decades, organizations used various ways to increase the volume of business, including mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Prior to any acquisition or capital investment, several activities need to be carried out with initial <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> playing the key role. In most cases the initial DD focuses on reviewing liquidity, investments (credit and equity investments), and risk management. With the ever-growing impact of IS on the organizations’ daily business support, reviewing the IS of an organization has become very important, if not vital. This is mainly due to the large dependence of the IS segment on substantial investments in quality and up-to-date support, ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of information. IS initial <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> is very comprehensive and demanding as it covers a range of segments, such as information security and operational risk assessment. Furthermore it should ascertain and assess compliance with the local regulation, security aspects of the implemented information system and establish and analyze any deviations. In addition <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> of information <b>system</b> should establish the possibility of adjustments to the corporate information system {{in the event of a}} positive decision on capital investment. It is necessary that these activities be performed in a short period of time. Between 1996 and 2006, I conducted over 60 IS <b>due</b> <b>diligences</b> in financial organizations in 15 European countries. Through the implementation of <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> and analysis of different methods, tools, standards, best practices and procedures (hereinafter approaches) the Universal framework for IS <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> delivery was formed. The presented framework is not a completely new method to be placed alongside others, but an attempt at creating a comprehensive synthesis method using existing approaches upgraded with innovations that proved useful through extensive personal experience with the use of standard approaches.

40|$|Cambridge University Press 2013. In {{the context}} of {{corporate}} accountability, <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> and complicity are two important concepts. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> as ‘the care that a reasonable person exercises to avoid harm to other persons or their property’. In the business context, <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> refers to the ‘research and analysis of a company or organization done {{in preparation for a}} business transaction’, or the ‘duty of a firm’s directors and officers to act prudently in evaluating associated risks in all transactions’. Complicity, on the other hand, is described as ‘association or participation in… a wrongful act’. <b>Due</b> <b>diligence</b> and complicity are thus different notions. This chapter will explore the various possible connections between these two concepts. Questions arising in this respect include, for example, whether the assessment and avoidance of the risk of complicity is part of a company’s <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> responsibility. If so, can complicity liability arise even though the company acted with <b>due</b> <b>diligence,</b> but harm nevertheless occurs?

40|$|This {{dissertation}} critically considers and {{assesses the}} potential of the EU FLEGT Scheme to provide an effective and equitable legal regime for curbing illegal logging and promoting sustainable forest management (SFM) and good forest governance (GFG) in African Partner Countries. It considers a broad range of issues starting with the state of Africa's forests and the international regulatory framework for SFM. A critical review of recent studies led to a theoretical framework comprising a set of specific legal issues/themes (substantive issues) central to SFM and GFG. These were accompanied by three broad cross - cutting themes. The substantive issues are: (i) security/clarity on land tenure, ownership and use rights; (ii) stable institutional structures; (iii) clear environmental and forestry standards; (iv) effective and equitable approval processes; (v) participatory, transparent and accountable decision - making; (vi) cooperation and coordination procedures; (vii) monitoring, evaluation and reporting; (viii) effective compliance and enforcement; (ix) financial incentives; (x) equitable sharing of benefits; (xi) conflict resolution procedures; and (xii) mixture of regulatory approaches (direct regulation and voluntary mechanisms). The cross - cutting themes entail: (i) clear coherent and consistent law and policy; (ii) adherence/respect of the rule of law; and (iii) knowledge, capacity and resources. A rigorous assessment of the EU FLEGT Scheme against this theoretical framework shows that the FLEGT Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPAs) and the EU Timber Regulation (EUTR) form a robust legal regime. The structure of FLEGT VPAs is based on the 16 Principles for FLEGT Partnership Agreements of 20 05 and the 18 key elements of FLEGT VPAs. Thus FLEGT VPAs have provided a landmark mechanism for multi - stakeholder participation in the forestry sector, and have propelled inclusivity in decision - making. Thus FLEGT VPAs are founded on international law and international trade laws. On the other hand, the EUTR is composed of a stringent <b>Due</b> <b>Diligence</b> <b>System</b> (DDS) and provision that emphasize legality as a cornerstone for FLEGT. In this context, legality requires the establishment of standards of legality, i. e. timber legality assurance systems and FLEGT licensing. This involves requirements for verification, guidelines for independent monitoring, and market - based legality assurance. Although the FLEGT VPAs and EUTR cover all the 15 legal themes listed above, inconsistences in national laws and sovereignty on forest resources have either hampered or slowed down effective and efficient implementation of FLEGT VPAs. Nonetheless, remarkable progress has been observed in forest governance across Partner Countries. More research is needed to ascertain the effectiveness of the EUTR and the degree of reduction in illegal logging in Partner Countries. Lastly, there are reports that that African timber producing countries have started to increase their exports to other international markets e. g. Australia, USA, China and Japan. Therefore, it is crucial that the EU collaborate with these international markets and enter into bilateral and multilateral negotiations so as to collectively deal with illegal logging and illegal timber and make a positive impact at a global scale...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. Mergers and {{acquisitions}} (M & A) {{are a big}} part of the corporate finance world. Everyday investment bankers arrange M & A transactions, which bring separate companies together to form larger ones. The key principle behind buying a company is to create shareholder value over and above that of the sum of the two companies. Two companies together are more valuable than two separate companies; at least that's the reasoning behind M & A. Before an M & A transaction, companies usually require some kind of evaluation of the company that is to be acquired. This evaluation is then used to determine whether the transaction should take place, and what the target price should be for the acquiring company. The most commonly known method used to do such an evaluation is known as a <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> The <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> process can be a long drawn out process, which can be extremely disruptive to an organisation. <b>Due</b> <b>diligences</b> can take several months to complete in a complex organization. The issue surrounding the <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> process is that it is not a standardized procedure and each organization or specialist carries out the <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> process differently, when considering a merger and acquisition. The problem is that there is no one structure, format or model which can make the necessary information available to the decision-makers of the acquiring company without going through the complete <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> process. If a financial <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> model was available, which could give pertinent information to decision-makers, huge <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> costs could be saved. Therefore the main study objective of this dissertation is to determine the value of a financial <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> before an M & A, and whether a financial <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> model would be beneficial to decision-makers of manufacturing companies. The study will lead to the development of a financial <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> model that can be used by South African manufacturing organisations for M & A. A combination of the theoretical techniques, literature review data and the empirical study data will be used to determine what should be included in a financial <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> model, which can be used by decision-makers to determine whether or not to pursue the merger and acquisition.

Methodology: This research applies a qualitative research approach. Ten semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants from an electro engineering company in Sweden that performs business acquisitions and <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> Secondary data was obtained from relevant scientific peer reviewed articles, book, and websites. Findings & Conclusion: This study provides insight regarding the connection between soft <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> and integration. To integrate target employees, it is essential that the soft <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> assessment manages to provide with knowledge surrounding cultural and HR related issues. Some of the issues identified to influence the integration are: quality of soft <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> assessment to minimize gap between target and acquiring firm, attitudes of employees, key personnel, organizational cultures, neglected risks and aptness between the target and acquiring firm. It is necessary to gather information about the factors mentioned above for the integration to proceed and for the acquisition to realize its purpose. Finally, if the strategic goal is to integrate an acquired company to achieve synergies and productiveness, the soft <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> assessment is of major importance to find implications and to act on gathered knowledge. Theoretical contributions: This study is one of the first to apply the concept of soft <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> to integration in acquisitions. The developed conceptual model reflects the influence of HR and cultural <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> on the integration process. It also signifies the influence of potential risks in the integration emanating from neglected soft <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> Managerial implications: By conducting soft <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> assessments the gap between target and acquiring firms could shrink, thus facilitating integration efforts. Managers should evaluate how they can make use of the main factors found influencing integration in their acquisitions. By using such factors, we found how critical aspects of how to successfully integrate retained personnel can be provided to managers and <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> teams. Furthermore, managers can closely scrutinize the risk identified to emerge from substandard soft <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> assessments, while being aware of how these can help managers to develop a deeper understanding for issues that can affect their integration efforts and facilitate the process by applying appropriate actions. Limitations: Since human and cultural related aspects are considered in this research, the findings related to the specific company with limited room for generalization and integration factors, may not concur with similar research. Furthermore, our research is based on a case study which in addition, limits the external validity. Therefore, there is a possibility of getting different answers with the same questions, thus limiting the application of this research to other companies. Suggestions for further research: Further research should focus on developing a strategic soft <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> framework to gain in-depth understanding of the target company. In addition, it should be investigated if and how the motives behind an acquisition influence the soft <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> assessment. ...|$|R

40|$|It is not {{surprising}} that many business deals fail to realize their expected future value because some deal makers fail to perform effective <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> Successful deal makers, however, know that <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> {{is one of the most}} important tasks in successful deal making. Thus, they avoid the psychological and contextual traps that cause poor <b>due</b> <b>diligence.</b> In this article, I describe the hazards – the psychological biases and contextual factors – that might affect the <b>due</b> <b>diligence</b> task. These hazards include information availability bias; confirmation bias; overconfidence bias; time pressure; self-interested agents; deal fever; narrow focus; and complexity. Following this review, I provide a number of suggestions to help deal makers and organizations overcome these hazards...|$|R
