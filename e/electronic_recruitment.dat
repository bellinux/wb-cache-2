We examined the content of 264 consecutive, <b>electronic</b> <b>recruitment</b> solicitations and evaluated whether the content would provide the necessary structure and expressiveness to implement a computerized recruitment tool within an electronic medical record. Email messages frequently included unspecific and temporal concepts that may challenge the fully automated recruitment process...|$|E
30|$|The <b>electronic</b> <b>recruitment</b> {{system at}} LINEEX follows a quite natural mechanism. The University of Valencia {{students}} get {{an email from}} the laboratory, announcing new sessions. They then go to a web based system to register in a given session, depending on their prior experience and the session requirements. The risk aversion test was the one by Holt and Laury (2002), based on a menu of ten paired lottery choices. Decisions in our experiment were matched with the decisions in the test by a common random code subjects used in both sessions. Identities were never linked to choices.|$|E
30|$|A {{total of}} 39 {{undergraduate}} students in Business and Economics from the University of Valencia {{took part in}} the experiment. All sessions were run at the Laboratory for Research in Experimental Economics (LINEEX) and standard <b>electronic</b> <b>recruitment</b> procedures were used to collect the subject pool. All subjects participating in the experiment had previously participated (weeks before the experiment was run) in other sessions facing a Raven test, a risk aversion test and a basic socioeconomic survey. 9 The list of participants in every session was randomized to control for any reputation or group identity effect. Anonymity was preserved using random codes and these tests were paid independently.|$|E

Because our target population was Twitter users, we used <b>electronic</b> modes of <b>recruitment</b> and information gathering so we knew all of our volunteers would at least have internet access. We also considered privacy and confidentiality when recruiting participants, as Twitter is an anonymous medium for some users. The following steps describe how we recruited our participants: 1.

5000|$|An {{applicant}} {{tracking system}} (ATS) is a software application {{that enables the}} <b>electronic</b> handling of <b>recruitment</b> needs. An ATS can be implemented or accessed online on an enterprise or small business level, depending {{on the needs of}} the company and there is also free and open source ATS software available. An ATS is very similar to customer relationship management (CRM) systems, [...] but are designed for recruitment tracking purposes. In many cases they filter applications automatically based on given criteria such as keywords, skills, former employers, years of experience and schools attended. This has caused many to adapt resume optimization techniques similar to those used in search engine optimization when creating and formatting their résumé.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Recruitment to {{clinical}} trials can be challenging. We identified anonymous potential participants to an existing pragmatic randomised controlled depression trial {{to assess the}} feasibility of using routinely collected data to identify potential trial participants. We discuss the strengths and limitations of this approach, assess its potential value, report challenges and ethical issues encountered. Methods Swansea University's Health Information Research Unit's Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) database of routinely collected health records was interrogated, using Structured Query Language (SQL). Read codes were used to create an algorithm of inclusion/exclusion criteria with which to identify suitable anonymous participants. Two independent clinicians rated the eligibility of the potential participants' identified. Inter-rater reliability was assessed using the kappa statistic and inter-class correlation. Results The study population (N = 37263) comprised all adults registered at five general practices in Swansea UK. Using the algorithm 867 anonymous potential participants were identified. The sensitivity and specificity results > 0. 9 suggested {{a high degree of}} accuracy from the algorithm. The inter-rater reliability results indicated strong agreement between the confirming raters. The Intra Class Correlation Coefficient (Cronbach's Alpha) > 0. 9, suggested excellent agreement and Kappa coefficient > 0. 8; almost perfect agreement. Conclusions This proof of concept study showed that routinely collected primary care data can be used to identify potential participants for a pragmatic randomised controlled trial of folate augmentation of antidepressant therapy for the treatment of depression. Further work will be needed to assess generalisability to other conditions and settings and the inclusion of this approach to support <b>Electronic</b> Enhanced <b>Recruitment</b> (EER). </p...|$|R
40|$|Performing {{business}} {{according to}} contemporary requirements influences companies for continuous usage of modern managerial tools, {{such as a}} human resource information system (HRIS) and <b>electronic</b> <b>recruitment</b> (ER). Human resources have been recognised as curtail resources and {{the main source of}} a competitive advantage in creation of successful business performance. In order to attract and select the top employees, companies use quality information software for attracting internal ones, and <b>electronic</b> <b>recruitment</b> for attracting the best possible external candidates. The main aim {{of this paper is to}} research the level of the usage of HRIS and ER within medium-size and large Croatian companies. Moreover, the additional aim of this paper is to evaluate the relationship among the usage of these modern managerial tools and the overall success of human resource management within these companies. For the purpose of this paper, primary and secondary research has been conducted in order to reveal the level of the usage of HRIS and ER as well as the overall success of human resource management in Croatian companies. The companies’ classification (HRIS and ER) is done by using the non-hierarchical k-means cluster method as well as the nonparametric Kruskal Wallis test. Further, the companies are ranked by the multicriteria PROMETHEE method. Relevant nonparametric tests are used for testing the overall companies’ HRM. Finally, binary logistic regression is estimated, relating binary variable HRM and HRIS development. After detailed research, it can be concluded that large Croatian companies apply HRIS in majority (with a positive relation to HRM performance), but still require certain degrees of its development...|$|E
40|$|The {{universal}} {{quest for}} good governance forces different countries to adopt e-recruitment as recruiting strategy in hiring their teeming workforce {{in line with}} global best practices. As part of public service reform Nigerian government encourage public sector organisations to jettison conventional recruitment method in favour of <b>electronic</b> <b>recruitment</b> for transparency, accessibility and efficiency in recruitment exercises. This study empirically investigates the relationship between e-recruitment adoption and good governance practices in Nigerian public service. The study Modified Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to analyse the response generated from 326 survey respondents. The findings indicated that e-recruitment adoption is yet to provide good governance. In the overall, this study offer important insight and recommended that government agencies involved should put effective machinery in motion in order to enrich and improve good governance practices in e-recruitment in Nigerian public sector...|$|E
40|$|Previously {{a person}} {{applied for a}} job using the {{traditional}} method of sending a posted résumé which took days if not weeks to return with an answer. Times have changed and the era of <b>electronic</b> <b>recruitment</b> is alive and well. This paper presents the ‘conventional’ method of recruiting; including views of different ‘new’ ways, with the focus on e-recruiting, its effectiveness and suggestions that the ‘old’ system used to recruit people {{is in need of}} an overhaul as well. The computerisation of human resource departments also means advertising jobs on the Internet, including the screening of applicants through various software packages. Does this imply that e-recruitment is in vogue and that it is effective? Companies like Nike have utilized the electronic recruiting methods in the best possible way. Software like ‘active recruiter’ has helped Nike to completely change their recruitment process and make it more effective. E-recruitment therefore seems to be revolutionising the way employers hire employee...|$|E
30|$|Phase I {{utilized}} individual, {{face-to-face interviews}} to assess patient understanding {{and ease of}} self-administration of the draft NVSA© items on an <b>electronic</b> diary (eDiary). <b>Recruitment</b> targeted 12 adult CKD patients on maintenance hemodialysis with SHPT. A quota was implemented to have 50 % (n[*]=[*] 6) of the 12 subjects be currently treated with cinacalcet {{at the time of}} screening. Two clinical sites enrolled patients (Houston, TX and Washington, DC). Clinicians were oriented to the study procedures, protocol, and requirements over the telephone and were asked to screen and recruit patients and schedule them for an interview if they qualified. Potential patients were telephoned and screened for eligibility against study criteria. Those eligible were asked to attend an enrollment and interview visit at the site to review and sign the Informed Consent Form, complete the Demographic Form, and to participate in an interview. Interviewers conducted in-person, one-on-one interviews using a semi-structured cognitive-interview guide. The interviews were conducted in two separate waves of six subjects each. Individual interview sessions lasted approximately 30  min. Institutional Review Board (IRB) submission and approval from Quorum Review IRB for the cognitive-interview study was secured by DaVita Clinical Research who maintained appropriate documentation and conducted management of the study in accordance with the ethical principles consistent with Good Clinical Practice and applicable regulatory requirements.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} case study {{research}} into six {{higher education institutions}} (three in the UK and three in the USA) that give prominence to their sustainability credentials in their paper form and/or <b>electronic</b> promotional and <b>recruitment</b> materials. The purpose of the research was to draw important lessons and identify significant issues concerning the sustainability branding and marketing of higher education institutions. Key findings include, first, the importance of calibrating sustainability marketing according to actual sustainability performance while also embracing a sustainability vision; second, the importance of combining internal with external marketing; third, the importance of institutional clarity in determining marketing parameters; fourth, the advantages of marrying broad-based ‘subtle’ marketing with intensive niche and segment marketing. It was found, too, that higher education institutions with a sustainability brand are not collecting systematic data to assess marketing impact on student recruitment, or utilizing the sustainability/employability interface to good marketing effect, or employing a multi-dimensional conception of sustainability in their marketing. There is clear evidence of the stirrings of movement away from paper-form towards electronic marketing across the cases considered. An overarching insight {{of the study is}} that rigorous institutional engagement with marketing sustainability credentials can {{have a significant impact on}} the quality and depth of sustainability performance by helping spread, enrich and diversify the institutional sustainability culture. education for sustainability; sustainability; university; marketing; branding...|$|R

The Biobank has leveraged in-person and <b>electronic</b> <b>recruitment</b> methods to enroll > 30, 000 subjects as of October 2015 at two academic medical centers in Partners HealthCare since launching in 2010. Through a close collaboration with the Partners Human Research Committee, the Biobank has developed a comprehensive informed consent process that addresses key patient concerns, including privacy and the return of research results. Lessons learned include the need for careful consideration of ethical issues, attention to the educational content of electronic media, the importance of patient authentication in electronic informed consent, the need for highly secure IT infrastructure and management of communications and the importance of flexible recruitment modalities and processes dependent on the clinical setting for recruitment...|$|E
40|$|Over {{recent years}} on-line {{recruiting}} which uses the spread and access of the World Wide Web (WWW) or Internet {{has become increasingly}} popular for recruitment agencies, job-seekers and organisations alike (e. g. Starcke, 1996; Wyld, 1998; Kay, 2000). Exponents of electronic recruiting claim it has changed the way the recruiting industry works {{and that it is}} faster, more efficient and cheaper than traditional methods (e. g. Browne, 1998; Useem, 1999; Stellar Services Home Page, 2000; Kay, 2000; topjobs. com. au, 2000). Despite the hyperbole that surrounds the unlimited and unbounded potential of the Web I will argue in this paper rather than representing a paradigmatic transformation, the practise of <b>electronic</b> <b>recruitment</b> {{is little more than a}} linguistic shift from recruitment to e-cruitment. The essence of selection and recruitment is unchanged - the requirement for an employee is identified either because of a vacancy or the creation of a new position. There is then a search for a suitable applicant; one or more persons are considered for the position, some process of evaluation is conducted and an applicant is selected followed by the notification of unsuccessful applicants. <b>Electronic</b> <b>recruitment</b> has enabled all these steps in the process to be conducted electronically, usually through the Internet. Baffled by the excitement and claims of electronic recruiters the author has attempted some analysis of I selection and recruitment from the psychodynamic perspective. Having identified significant conscious and unconscious anxieties generated by the processes of selection and recruitment, discussion is then provided on the creation of social defenses in response to these considerable anxieties. It is from this context the willingness of recruiters to utilise the new technologies can be understood. Without challenging the efficiency of o n-line recruitment, and there are some who do (Armes, 1999;HRFocus, 2000) what appears to have changed dramatically is the creation of a new dynamic between recruiter and potential recruit. It will be argued the ready acceptance of on-line recruitment is not just because of anticipated efficiencies but because the newly created dynamic made possible by the innovation of the Internet provides an extremely effective technological tool for recruiters to defend against the anxieties generated by the process of selection and recruitment...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 46 - 47). The {{job market}} has changed considerably {{over the last}} fifty years. Job seekers are requested to have more specialized skills and a greater amount of knowledge in their fields. The recruitment process has become extremely tedious, especially with the globalization of markets. Many <b>electronic</b> <b>recruitment</b> suites and websites {{are available on the}} market, but most of them cover only the application part of the recruitment process. Almost all middle and large companies have on-line application forms on their websites. The most essential part however, the interview, has not yet been covered in the recruitment automation process. There is therefore need for a complete recruitment package that is both easily accessible, and that follows all the steps of the real recruitment cycle. Our "intelligent" system combines both the application form features as well as the interviewing portion of the recruitment process. It also gives suggestions to the administrator or HR person about whom to hire for a particular job vacancy, based on specific criteria adapted to this job vacancy. 1 bound copy: x, 52 leaves; ill.
