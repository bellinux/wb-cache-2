5|$|Iron {{plays an}} {{important}} role in biology, forming complexes with molecular oxygen in hemoglobin and myoglobin; these two compounds are common oxygen transport proteins in vertebrates. Iron is also the metal at the active site of many important redox enzymes dealing with cellular respiration and oxidation and reduction in plants and animals. A human male of average height has about 4 grams of iron in his body, a female about 3.5 grams. This iron is <b>distributed</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> body in hemoglobin, tissues, muscles, bone marrow, blood proteins, enzymes, ferritin, hemosiderin, and transport in plasma.|$|E

5|$|Out of the 804 {{species of}} flora <b>distributed</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> park, six are endemic, {{completely}} exclusive {{to the park}} area, and cannot be observed anywhere else on earth, while another 30 are indigenous. The most common and widely distributed plant species throughout the national park are Mediterranean maquis shrubs such as the Phoenician juniper (Juniperus phoenicea).

5|$|The Cuban iguana is <b>distributed</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> rocky {{southern}} {{coastal areas}} of mainland Cuba {{and its surrounding}} islets with a feral population thriving on Isla Magueyes, Puerto Rico.

As a defense measure, the Cuban iguana often makes its home within or near prickly-pear cacti.|$|E
5|$|The energy {{generation}} of the Sun is based upon thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium. This occurs in the core region of the star using the proton–proton chain reaction process. Because there is no convection in the solar core, the helium concentration builds up in that region without being <b>distributed</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> star. The temperature {{at the core of}} the Sun is too low for nuclear fusion of helium atoms through the triple-alpha process, so these atoms do not contribute to the net {{energy generation}} that is needed to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium of the Sun.|$|E

5|$|The {{government}} exerts {{greater control}} over broadcast media than print media, especially due to finance and licensing. The Swiss Broadcasting Corporation, whose name was recently changed to SRG SSR, is charged with the production and broadcast of radio and television programmes. SRG SSR studios are <b>distributed</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> various language regions. Radio content is produced in six central and four regional studios while the television programmes are produced in Geneva, Zürich and Lugano. An extensive cable network also allows most Swiss to access the programmes from neighbouring countries.|$|E
5|$|Alcelaphus lelwel x cokii: Known as the Kenya Highland {{hartebeest}} or the Laikipia hartebeest. It is a {{cross between}} the Lelwel and Coke's hartebeest. This hybrid is lighter in colour and larger than Coke's hartebeest. It is a light buff with reddish-tawny upper parts, and the head is longer than in Coke's hartebeest. Both sexes have horns, which are heavier as well as longer {{than those of the}} parents. It was formerly <b>distributed</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> western Kenyan highlands, between Lake Victoria and Mount Kenya, but is now believed to be restricted to the Lambwe Valley (south-west Kenya) and Laikipia and nearby regions of west-central Kenya.|$|E
5|$|As Duckworth {{gathered}} his squadron, Northumberlands mainmast collapsed across the deck, causing severe {{damage to the}} ship's fittings. Although Cochrane's flagship was the most severely damaged of the squadron, all had suffered to a degree: Superbs men counted 60 shot holes while Atlas {{was out of control}} and Donegal had lost one of her topmasts. Casualties were also <b>distributed</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> fleet, with Northumberland and Spencer suffering the worst and Atlas the least except for the barely engaged Agamemnon. Total losses were 74 killed and 264 wounded and several ships were damaged, but Duckworth was rapidly able to effect repairs as his ships remained on station to observe the situation ashore.|$|E

50|$|Because larger objects {{have a lower}} surface-area-to-volume ratio, {{they are}} more able to retain heat. This heat {{retention}} translates to a uniform temperature increase <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> food as the heat dissipates to cooler areas. Additionally, foods with a higher water content are more subject to carry over cooking as water has a higher heat capacity and will have more heat to <b>distribute</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> food item.|$|R
5|$|At {{a special}} sitting of Parliament on 28 August 1939, Rhodesia {{determined}} {{to stand by}} Great Britain {{in the event that}} war should break out, as was expected. Of a white population of just 65,000, only 10,000 were fit and available for active service. It was decided not to create a full Rhodesian formation: if it were wiped out, the colony's future prosperity would be put at risk. Instead mostly small groups of Rhodesians were <b>distributed</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> British Army, Navy and Air Force. In the Defence Report of 1939, it was stated that forces would be trained and organised not only for internal security and defence but also to defend British interests in service outside its borders.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} centuries AD, Palmyra's main trade route ran {{east to the}} Euphrates where it {{connected}} at the city of Hīt. The route then ran south along the river toward the port of Charax Spasinu on the Persian Gulf, where Palmyrene ships traveled {{back and forth to}} India. Goods were imported from India, China and Transoxiana, and exported west to Emesa (or Antioch) then the Mediterranean ports, from which they were <b>distributed</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> Roman Empire. In addition to the usual route some Palmyrene merchants used the Red Sea, probably {{as a result of the}} Roman–Parthian Wars. Goods were carried overland from the seaports to a Nile port, and then taken to the Egyptian Mediterranean ports for export. Inscriptions attesting a Palmyrene presence in Egypt date to the reign of Hadrian.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, trade dollars began {{appearing}} in American commerce. In early 1875, Congress passed the Specie Redemption Act, allowing the Treasury {{to pay out}} silver coins in exchange for paper currency. That act, combined with {{a drop in the}} price of silver, caused hoarded or exported silver coins to reappear in commerce within the United States. Many trade dollars were reimported, especially to California. After the value of silver began to decline and the intrinsic value of the coins fell below one dollar, bullion depositors began having their silver struck as trade dollars and selling them wholesale to be <b>distributed</b> <b>throughout</b> <b>the</b> country. Bullion producers opted to coin their silver into trade dollars because the Coinage Act of 1873 specified that silver brought to the Mint could only be struck as such or cast into bars.|$|E
