In a signature performance, he would appear on stage in outlandish drag or other costume, looking very huge. He would sing and dance about. Then suddenly, much to the audience's surprise, he would drop onto his back and simulate giving birth to a petite and naked young woman, who was his friend and assistant Nicola Bateman. She had been hidden {{for the first part}} of the performance by being strapped to Leigh's belly with <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> crotch. Then she would slip out of her harness, and appear to pop out of Bowery's belly along with a lot of stage blood and links of sausages, while Bowery wailed. [...] Bowery would then bite off the umbilical cord and the two would take a bow. Boy George said he saw it a number of times, and that it [...] "never ceased to impress or revolt".|$|E

60|$|She turned pale, she stopped, then, gently {{taking his}} arm, she hid <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> breast.|$|E
60|$|FRANK. Of course I do. Ever so much better. Vivvums mustn't lecture: {{her little}} boy's incorrigible. [He {{attempts}} to take <b>her</b> <b>face</b> caressingly <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands].|$|R
6000|$|... "O Robin, Robin!" [...] exclaimed Mrs Gore, {{throwing}} her arms suddenly round her husband's neck, and hiding <b>her</b> sobbing <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> breast, [...] "d'ye {{think they can}} still be alive?" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{broke off}} in a sudden fit of sobbing. He took <b>her</b> <b>face</b> gently <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands, {{and held it up}} to him. It was he, now, who was to play the part of consoler.|$|R
60|$|Proserpine {{threw her}} arms round the neck of her husband, and, hiding <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> breast, wept.|$|E
60|$|Sergeant Dunham {{laid his}} hand feebly {{on the head}} of Mabel as she ceased praying, and buried <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> blanket.|$|E
6000|$|Stephen clung {{close to}} Harold {{in a state}} of {{agitation}} which was almost hysterical. She buried <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> shoulder, sobbing brokenly: ...|$|E
60|$|He {{turned the}} light from <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> Something <b>in</b> <b>his</b> voice and the apologetic haste with which he moved the lamp seemed to relax the strain of the situation. The feeling of stunned {{surprise}} began to leave her. She found herself thinking coherently again.|$|R
60|$|She turned quickly towards him, {{eager for}} the comfort of his {{extended}} arms. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> was buried <b>in</b> <b>his</b> shoulder.|$|R
60|$|Ffoulkes {{turned his}} head away, pretending to busy himself with the coffee-making utensils. He {{could not bear to}} see that look of {{hopelessness}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> for <b>in</b> <b>his</b> heart he could not find the wherewithal to cheer her. Despair was beginning to seize on him too, and this he would not let her see.|$|R
60|$|My doggie {{broke from}} my grasp with a shriek of joy, and sprang into her arms. She buried <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> shaggy neck and {{absolutely}} hugged him.|$|E
6000|$|Grace {{drew the}} paper from her pocket, blushed slightly, kissed her husband, and then putting {{her arms around}} his neck, laid <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> breast, while he read aloud, in Spanish, the following:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 1 2 2 2 Deleted extra space {{after opening}} double {{quotation}} mark Vol. I--Page 81, line 14 at his feet, buried <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> lap. [...] "*Ella," [...] he said, [...] "the only ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sorry," [...] said Jimmy. [...] "I didn't think. Is that better?" [...] He {{turned the}} light from <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> Something <b>in</b> <b>his</b> voice and the apologetic haste with which he moved the torch seemed to relax the strain of the situation. The feeling of stunned {{surprise}} began to leave her. She found herself thinking coherently again.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Unga? She {{would not}} eat of the ptarmigan. She lay {{with her arms}} about <b>his</b> neck, <b>her</b> <b>face</b> deep <b>in</b> <b>his</b> yellow hair. I drew the fire close, that she might not feel the frost, but she crept to the other side. And I built a fire there; yet it was little good, for she would not eat. And in this manner they still lie {{up there in the}} snow.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{is indeed}} my father's face and form,' said Lucy, turning very pale. Bertram ran to support her, the Dominie to fetch water to throw upon <b>her</b> <b>face</b> (which <b>in</b> <b>his</b> haste {{he took from}} the boiling tea-urn), when {{fortunately}} her colour, returning rapidly, saved her from the application of this ill-judged remedy. 'I conjure you to tell me, Mr. Sampson,' she said, in an interrupted yet solemn voice, 'is this my brother?' ...|$|R
60|$|He did not answer, {{but took}} <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands {{and kissed her}} passionately. They arrived at Margaret's house, and she tripped up to the door. She {{held out her hand}} to him, smiling.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a queer way {{of showing}} it." [...] Her voice was now a gentle reproof, the sweetest of surrenders and forgiveness. He leaned forward, took <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands, and kissed her, murmuring: ...|$|E
60|$|Lady Armine, without speaking, {{knelt down}} by his bedside {{and took him}} in her arms. She buried <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> breast. He felt her tears upon his heart. He could not move; he could not speak. At length he sobbed aloud.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, sir," [...] said Janet, [...] "the {{poor girl}} was so put about {{that she did}} give him one touch across the face with the rolling-pin, and he be all bloody now, in the back kitchen." [...] At hearing this {{achievement}} of hers thus spoken of, Bridget sobbed more hysterically than ever; but the doctor, looking at her arm as she held her apron to <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> thought <b>in</b> <b>his</b> heart that Joe must have had so much the worst of it, {{that there could be}} no possible need for the interference of Thomas the groom.|$|R
60|$|And on {{the moment}} the black horse, Spades, coming from the meadow, whinnied at sight of her. Ellen leaped up and ran swiftly, but her feet seemed to be stumbling. She hugged the horse and buried <b>her</b> hot <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> mane and clung to him. Then just as violently she rushed for her saddle and bridle and carried the heavy weight as easily {{as if it had}} been an empty sack. Throwing them upon him, she buckled and {{strapped}} with strong, eager hands. It never occurred to her that she was not dressed to ride. Up she flung herself. And the horse, sensing her spirit, plunged into strong, free gait down the canyon trail.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Beatrice meets Dr. Artaud by chance. With Margaret (Annika Peterson), a remorseful former coworker of Beatrice's, they hatch a plan {{to escape}} back to Iceland with the Monster. They make their escape, but are pursued by the government, who fears the Monster and Artaud might fall into the wrong hands. Artaud builds a machine that will kill the Monster. Beatrice bids the Monster a tearful farewell, and kisses him goodbye. As the machine starts, the army storms their hideout. As the lights flicker on and off and the machine moves the Monster into place (in a process {{mirroring}} Beatrice's surgery), the Monster and Beatrice face each other one last time. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> flickers <b>in</b> <b>his</b> vision for several minutes before the screen blackens.|$|R
60|$|She {{closed the}} door and left John alone. He went back to the billiard-table, but somehow or other his skill seemed to have vanished. He had the picture of <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> mind, the subtle meaning of her lips, the mockery of her eyes.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Temple {{looked upon}} the ground; a blended {{expression}} of mirth and sentiment played over her features, and then looking {{up with a}} smile contending with her tearful eye, she hid <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> breast and murmured, 'I watched him sleeping. Did he indeed dream of me?' ...|$|E
60|$|Ailie did not move. She {{stood with}} her hands tightly clasped and her eyes {{starting}} almost out of their sockets. At last her feelings found vent. She threw her arms round her father's neck, and burying <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> bosom, burst into a passionate flood of tears.|$|E
60|$|He looked full at <b>her</b> {{handsome}} <b>face,</b> and <b>in</b> <b>his</b> own handsome <b>face</b> {{there was}} a light of blended admiration, anger, and reproach, which she--who loved him so in secret whose heart had long been so full, and he the cause of its overflowing--drooped before. She tried hard to retain her firmness, but he saw it melting away under <b>his</b> eyes. <b>In</b> the moment of its dissolution, and of his first full knowledge of his influence upon her, she dropped, and he caught her on his arm.|$|R
60|$|He {{laid her}} down on the bank. She was quite {{unconscious}} and running with water. He made the water come from her mouth, he worked to restore her. He did not have to work very long before he could feel the breathing begin again in her; she was breathing naturally. He worked a little longer. He could feel her live beneath his hands; she was coming back. He wiped <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> wrapped <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> overcoat, looked round into the dim, dark-grey world, then lifted her and staggered down the bank and across the fields.|$|R
50|$|The king, {{confused}} by the two conflicting accounds of who this man was, decided to put Subramanian to the test. Therefore, he asked Subramanian whether today was a full moon day or a new moon day. At that time, Subramanian was still absorbed in meditation on the Divine Mother, seeing <b>her</b> shining <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> mind. Subramanian, seeing the Goddess' face and mistaking it for the moon, responded to the king {{saying that it was}} a full moon day when it was actually a new moon day. The king, deciding that Subramanian must be mad, ordered that he be burnt at dusk if the moon failed to appear.After some time, the king’s army awakened Subramanian and ordered him to come with them to be executed for his madness. On returning to ordinary consciousness, Subramanian realized that he had mistaken the face of the Divine Mother for the full moon, making him say it was a full moon day when, in actuality, it was a new moon day.|$|R
60|$|Here Grandfather was {{interrupted}} by little Alice, who hid <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> lap, and murmured a wish {{that he would not}} talk any more about Cotton Mather and the evil spirits. Grandfather kissed her, and told her that angels were the only spirits whom she had anything to do with.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh--my boy!" [...] she faltered. Her lip trembled, {{her face}} broke, and, {{snatching}} up the child, she buried <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> shoulder and cried painfully. She {{was one of}} those women who cannot cry; whom it hurts as it hurts a man. It was like ripping something out of her, her sobbing.|$|E
6000|$|They were silent. Schirene drew Alroy to his rough seat, {{and gently}} placing herself on his knees, {{threw her arms}} round his neck, and buried <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> breast. After a few minutes she raised her head, and whispered in his ear in irresistible accents of sweet exultation, 'We shall be free to-morrow!' ...|$|E
6000|$|By way of answer {{he placed}} his own behind his back, saying: [...] "To your business, woman." [...] Yet his eyes searched <b>her</b> face--the <b>face</b> which <b>in</b> <b>his</b> folly he still loved; and thus it came about that he never saw sundry of the dead bodies, which lay {{in the shadow of}} the stone, begin to quicken into life, and inch by inch to arise, first to their knees and next to their feet. He never saw or heard them, yet, as the words left his lips, they sprang upon him from every side, holding him so that he could not move.|$|R
60|$|The {{game was}} taken up again. Allie sensed a {{different}} note in it. The gambler Hough now <b>faced</b> <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> position at the table; and behind every card he played {{there seemed to be}} intense purpose and tremendous force. Ancliffe soon left the game. But he appeared fascinated where formerly he had been indifferent. Soon it developed that Hough, by his spirit and skill, was driving his opponents, inciting their passion for play, working upon their feelings. Durade seemed the weakest gambler, though he had the best luck. Good luck balanced his excited play. The two other gamblers pitted themselves against Hough.|$|R
60|$|Steadily as she {{controlled}} herself, {{the confession}} of her heart's secret {{found its way}} into <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> The coldly composed expression which had confronted the priest when she spoke to him, melted away softly under the influence of Romayne's voice and Romayne's look. Without any positive change of color, her delicate skin glowed faintly, as if it felt some animating inner warmth. Her eyes and lips brightened with a new vitality; her frail elegant figure seemed insensibly to strengthen and expand, like the leaf of a flower under a favoring sunny air. When she answered Romayne (agreeing with him, it is needless to say), there was a tender persuasiveness in her tones, shyly inviting him still to speak to her and still to look at her, which would in itself have told Father Benwell the truth, even if he had not been in a position to see <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> Confirmed <b>in</b> <b>his</b> doubts of her, he looked, with concealed suspicion, at Lady Loring next. Sympathy with Stella was undisguisedly expressed to him in the honest blue eyes of Stella's faithful friend.|$|R
