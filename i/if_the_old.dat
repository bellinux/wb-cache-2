500|$|The film {{is presumed}} lost as no known {{surviving}} {{copies of the}} film exist. A synopsis of the film was published in The Moving Picture World. It states: [...] "Glade and Sears are next door neighbors and old friends. Glade has a daughter, while Sears has a son. The young people have never met, being away at school while the old folks have been cementing their friendship. As the two men own adjoining places, {{they believe that the}} best thing for the younger people to do is to get married. So they try to bring this about. Gladys Glade and Charlie Sears meet on the train while they are returning home and start a flirtation. Perhaps they would have married in the end, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> folks hadn't 'butted in.' As it is, they lose all interest in each other. Then the fathers try another tack. They decide to be bitter enemies in public, hoping the opposition will bring the children together. The new plan works like a charm, and Gladys and Charlie, realizing their parents' shortcomings, decide to elope. They do so, much to the satisfaction of Glade and Sears." ...|$|E

Nevertheless, {{the woman was}} taken out of the asylum and given a room in the Berlin home of Baron Arthur von Kleist, a Russian émigré who had been a police chief in Russian Poland before the fall of the Tsar. The Berlin policeman who handled the case, Detective Inspector Franz Grünberg, thought that Kleist [...] "may have had ulterior motives, as was hinted at in émigré circles: <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> conditions should ever be restored in Russia, he hoped for great advancement from having looked after the young woman." [...] She began calling herself Anna Tschaikovsky, choosing [...] "Anna" [...] as a short form of [...] "Anastasia", although Peuthert [...] "described her everywhere as Anastasia". Tschaikovsky stayed in the houses of acquaintances, including Kleist, Peuthert, a poor working-class family called Bachmann, and at Inspector Grünberg's estate at Funkenmühle, near Zossen. At Funkenmühle, Grünberg arranged for the Tsarina's sister, Princess Irene of Hesse and by Rhine, to meet Tschaikovsky, but Irene did not recognize her. Grünberg also arranged a visit from Crown Princess Cecilie of Prussia, but Tschaikovsky refused to speak to her, and Cecilie was left perplexed by the encounter.

500|$|The {{relative}} {{chronology of}} Sahure's reign {{is well established}} by historical records and contemporary artefacts, showing that he succeeded Userkaf and was in turn succeeded by Neferirkare Kakai. The Turin canon, a king list written during the 19th Dynasty in the early Ramesside era (12921189 BC), credits him with a reign of 12 years [...] 5 months and 12 days. In contrast, the near contemporary annal of the 5th Dynasty known as the Palermo Stone preserves his 2nd, 3rd, 5th and 6th years on the throne {{as well as his}} final year of reign and even records the day of his death as the 28th of Shemu II (9th month). The document notes six or seven cattle counts, which would indicate a reign of at least 12 full years <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Old</b> Kingdom cattle count was held biennially (i.e. every 2 years) as this annal document implies for the early 5th Dynasty. If this assumption is correct and Sahure's highest attested date was the year after the 6th count rather than his 7th count as Wilkinson believes, then this date would mean that Sahure died in his 13th year and should be given a reign of 13 years 5 months and 12 days. This number would be only one year more than the Turin Canon's 12-year figure for Sahure. It is also closer to the 13 years figure given in Manetho's Aegyptiaca, a history of ancient Egypt written in the 3rd century BC.|$|E

2500|$|This {{ceiling was}} done {{at the time the}} new Chapel was built.

The fan-vaulting in St. Mary's Porch was done in 1637, and the great fan-vaulted staircase at Christ Church was not done until 1640.

2500|$|The play, however, doesn’t simply {{depict the}} fall of one order, it also depicts the rise of another; [...] "How the nation might have {{remained}} true to itself is signified by the words and deeds of Talbot. What she {{is in danger of}} becoming is signified by the shortcomings of the French, failings that crop up increasingly amongst Englishman [...] also manifest are an English decline towards French effeminacy and the beginnings of reliance upon fraud and cunning rather than manly courage and straightforward manly virtue." [...] <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> mode of honourable conduct is specifically represented by Talbot and Henry V, the new mode of duplicity and Machiavellianism is represented by Joan, who employs a type of warfare with which Talbot is simply unable to cope. This is seen most clearly when she sneaks into Rouen and subsequently refuses to face Talbot in a battle. Talbot finds this kind of behaviour incomprehensible and utterly dishonourable. As such, he finds himself fighting an enemy who uses tactics he is incapable of understanding; with the French using what he sees as unconventional methods, he proves unable to adapt. This represents one of the ironies in the play's depiction of chivalry; it is the very resoluteness of Talbot's honour and integrity, his insistence in preserving an old code abandoned by all others, which ultimately defeats him; his inability to adjust means he becomes unable to function in the newly established 'dishonourable' context. As such, the play is not entirely nostalgic about chivalry; [...] "so often the tenets of chivalry are mocked by word and action. The play is full of moments of punctured aristocratic hauteur." ...|$|E
2500|$|The second view of Saul {{makes him}} {{appear in the}} most {{favourable}} light as man, as hero, and as king. This view {{is similar to that}} of the monarchical source. In this view it was on account of his modesty that he did not reveal the fact that he had been anointed king (1 Samuel 10:16; Meg. 13b); and he was extraordinarily upright as well as perfectly just. Nor was there any one more pious than he (M. Q. 16b; Ex. Rashi 30:12); for when he ascended the throne he was as pure as a child, and had never committed sin (Yoma 22b). He was marvelously handsome; and the maidens who told him concerning Samuel (cf 1 Samuel 9:11–13) talked so long with him that they might observe his beauty the more (Ber. 48b). In war he was able to march 120 miles without rest. When he received the command to smite Amalek (1 Samuel 15:3), Saul said: For one found slain the Torah requires a sin offering and here so many shall be slain. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>old</b> have sinned, why should the young suffer; and if men have been guilty, why should the cattle be destroyed? It was this mildness that cost him his crown. And while Saul was merciful to his enemies, he was strict with his own people; when he found out that Ahimelech, a kohen, had assisted David with finding food, Saul, in retaliation, killed the rest of the 85 kohanim of the family of Ahimelech and the rest of his hometown, Nov. ( [...] ; Num. Rashi 1:10) The fact that he was merciful even to his enemies, being indulgent to rebels themselves, and frequently waiving the homage due to him, was incredible as well as deceiving. But if his mercy toward a foe was a sin, it was his only one; and it was his misfortune that it was reckoned against him, while David, although he had committed much iniquity, was so favored that it was not remembered to his injury (Yoma 22b; M. Q. 16b, and Rashi ad loc.). In some respects Saul was superior to David, e.g., in having only one concubine {Rizpah}, while David had many. Saul expended his own substance for the war, and although he knew that he and his sons would fall in battle, he nevertheless went forward, while David heeded the wish of his soldiers not to go to war in person (2 Samuel 21:17; Lev. Rashi 26:7; Yalq., Sam. 138).|$|E
