40|$|Introduction. Diffuse {{alveolar}} damage (DAD) is a morphological {{prototype of}} acute interstitial pneumonia. Hospital autopsies or open-lung biopsies {{are used to}} monitor common alveolar damage and hyaline membrane (HM) development histopathologically. The {{aim of this study}} was to detect histopathological profiles and frequency of DAD and HM in adult <b>forensic</b> <b>autopsies.</b> Materials and Methods. In total, 6813 reports with histopathological samples in 12, 504 cases on which an autopsy was performed between 2006 and 2008 were investigated. Sixty-six individuals > 18 years of age who were diagnosed with DAD were included. Hematoxylin- and eosin-stained lung preparations were reexamined in line with the 2002 American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society idiopathic interstitial pneumonia consensus criteria. Results. Histopathological examination revealed that 50 cases (75. 7 %) were in the exudative phase and 16 (24. 2 %) were in the proliferative phase. Only the rate of alveolar exudate/oedema in exudative phase cases (= 0. 003); those of alveolar histiocytic desquamation (= 0. 037), alveolar fibrosis (= 0. 017), chronic inflammation (= 0. 02), and alveolar fibrin (= 0. 001) in proliferative cases were significantly higher. The presence of alveolar fibrin was the only independent variable in favour of proliferative cases (= 0. 016). Conclusion. The detection of all DAD morphological criteria with the same intensity is not always possible in each case. <b>Forensic</b> <b>autopsies</b> may provide a favourable means for expanding our knowledge about acute lung damage, DAD, and interstitial lung disease...|$|R

A <b>forensic</b> <b>autopsy</b> was performed in 88.3 % of Finnish R 00 –R 99 -coded deaths, whereas only 3.5 % of Danish R 00 –R 99 -coded deaths were investigated with the forensic or medical autopsy.

40|$|Background: In 1992, {{there were}} {{major changes in}} Swedish law of the deceased, which had led to a {{dramatic}} decrease in autopsy rates. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the prevalence of fatal or potential fatal surgical diseases within a Swedish <b>forensic</b> <b>autopsy</b> cohort, before and after this change in legislation. Methods: Deaths referred for <b>forensic</b> <b>autopsy</b> at the Institution of Forensic Medicine, Lund University Hospital, Sweden, between 1970 - 1982 and 2000 - 2004, were studied regarding the prevalence of aorto-iliac diseases, acute abdomen and abdominal cancer. Results: The <b>forensic</b> <b>autopsy</b> rates in the population during the two time periods were 14. 0 % (29 399 patients) and 5. 3 % (4487 patients), respectively. The total prevalence of surgical diseases has increased significantly from 67. 3 (95 % confidence interval 64. 3 - 70. 2) to 83. 4 (74. 9 - 91. 8) per 1000 autopsies, respectively. The cause-specific mortality ratios in patients with fatal acute abdomen increased significantly from 16. 5 (15. 1 - 18. 0) to 39. 0 (33. 2 - 44. 8) per 1000 autopsies, respectively, and there was almost a three-time increase in patients with fatal gastrointestinal haemorrhage and acute alcohol-related pancreatitis.

50|$|The police procedural, {{or police}} crime drama, is a subgenre of detective fiction that {{attempts}} to convincingly depict the activities of a police force as they investigate crimes. Although traditional detective novels usually concentrate on a single crime, police procedurals frequently depict investigations into several unrelated crimes in a single story. Traditional mysteries usually adhere to the convention of having the criminal's identity concealed until the climax (the so-called whodunit), whereas in police procedurals, the perpetrator's identity is often known to the audience from the outset (the inverted detective story). Police procedurals depict a number of police-related topics such as <b>forensics,</b> <b>autopsies,</b> the gathering of evidence, the use of search warrants, and interrogation.|$|R
40|$|Background: Death {{from cancer}} is mostly {{considered}} as natural deaths. The role of cancer on {{the cause of}} death in forensic cases like sudden deaths, negligence or malpractice claims are being investigated. In a small amount of forensic cases, cancer is found incidentally at the autopsy. The aim {{of this study was to}} reveal characteristics of the cases in which cancer was diagnosed and types of malignancies in medicolegal autopsies. In addition, the role of <b>forensic</b> <b>autopsies</b> in determining oncological diseases was discussed. Methods: <b>Forensic</b> <b>autopsies</b> were performed in the Morgue Department of Forensic Medicine Council in İzmir for eight years were retrospectively reviewed. Cases that postmortem histopathological examination performed and malignant tumors diagnosed were included in the study. Data about age, sex, location of tumors, immediate causes of death and the potential relation between tumors and the primary cause of death were investigated. Results: In eight year period (between 2001 and 2009), 3722 medicolegal autopsies were done by postmortem histopathological examination. In 86 cases such kind of tumors were observed. In seven of 86 cases the tumors were determined as benign and excluded from the study. The remaining 79 cases with malignant tumors included in the study, 63 (79. 7 %) were male and 16 (20. 3 %) were female, mean age 54. 96 ± 20. 35 (range: 7 - 88 years). The tumors were most frequently located in respiratory system (35. 4 %), gastrointestinal system (19 %), genitourinary system (10. 1 %) and central nervous system (8. 9 %). The males most frequently had tumors in the respiratory system (42. 9 %) and the females in the endocrine system (25 %). According to histopathological classification of the tumors, the most frequent tumors were epithelial tumors (65. 8 %), followed by hemopoetic (12. 7 %), mesenchymal (7. 6 %), glial (5. 1 %) and neuroendocrine tumors (2. 5 %) and timoma (1. 3 %). The tumors could not be histopathologically differentiated in 5. 1 % of the deaths. Cause of death was considered as cancer related complications in 58 cases (73. 4 %), other natural causes in 6 cases (7. 6 %) and external factors such as traumas and intoxications in 10 cases (12. 7 %). The cause of could not determined following complete autopsy and postmortem investigation in 5 cases (6. 3 %). Conclusion: Providing accurate cancer statistics by only clinical trials or medical autopsies that are diminished nowadays and clinical cancer outputs seems to be inadequate. We participated that investigating malignancies in large series of <b>forensic</b> <b>autopsies</b> would be contributed to data about public health.
