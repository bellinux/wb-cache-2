50|$|The M3 carbine was an M2 carbine {{fitted with}} a mount {{designed}} to accept an <b>infrared</b> <b>sight</b> for use at night. It was initially used with the M1 sniperscope, and an active <b>infrared</b> <b>sight,</b> and saw action in 1945 with the Army during the invasion of Okinawa. Before the M3 carbine and M1 sniperscope were type-classified, they were known as the T3 and T120, respectively. The system continued to be developed, {{and by the time}} of the Korean War, the M3 carbine was used with the M3 sniperscope.|$|R

50|$|Used by the U.S. Army, the U.S. Marine Corps, {{as well as}} {{many foreign}} militaries, the M47 Dragon was first fielded in January 1975 to U.S. Army {{soldiers}} stationed in mainland Europe. The effective range of the Dragon was about 1000 meters, with the missile traveling 100 meters per second, guided by an <b>infrared</b> <b>sight.</b> The operator had to continue to track the missile to its target, which exposed him to enemy fire.|$|R
50|$|Aimpoint LPI: <b>Infrared</b> laser <b>sight</b> to {{be mounted}} on either a Picatinny rail or {{directly}} {{on some of}} the CompML or CompM sights.|$|R
50|$|The hull {{is made of}} {{all-welded}} homogeneous armour plate, {{and provides}} protection against small arms fire. The vehicle carries a maximum of 15 including crew. The driver sits in the front left of the hull, and has a single piece hatch, which opens to the left. The driver is provided with three day periscopes. One {{of them can be}} replaced by a passive low-light-level night vision device or <b>infrared</b> <b>sight.</b> The commander sits behind the driver and has a single piece hatch.|$|R
50|$|The {{most recent}} {{addition}} to the ITAS system is the ITAS-FTL (far target location) which incorporates a new module called PADS (position attitude determination subsystem), a device which attaches {{to the top of}} the ITAS <b>sighting</b> <b>unit</b> and uses differential GPS tracking to relay precise coordinate data to the operator.|$|R
50|$|F-104G: 1,122 {{aircraft}} of {{the main}} version produced as multi-role fighter-bombers. Manufactured by Lockheed, and under license by Canadair and a consortium of European companies that included Messerschmitt/MBB, Dornier, Fiat, Fokker, and SABCA. The type featured strengthened fuselage and wing structure, increased internal fuel capacity, an enlarged vertical fin, strengthened landing gear with larger tires, and revised flaps for improved combat maneuvering. Upgraded avionics included a new Autonetics NASARR F15A-41B radar with air-to-air and ground mapping modes, the Litton LN-3 Inertial Navigation System (the first on a production fighter), and an <b>infrared</b> <b>sight.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{the novel}} Man Plus by Frederick Pohl, an able-bodied astronaut, Roger Torraway, is surgically altered {{in order to}} augment his fragile human body and allow him to {{function}} in the harsh climate of Mars. The result is both [...] "monstrous" [...] (he has bat-like wings, <b>infrared</b> <b>sight,</b> an enhanced brain capable of processing all the new sensory inputs) and [...] "freeing" [...] (his cyborg body is more [...] "naturally" [...] made for Mars, as opposed to his all-human colleagues on the Mars mission). Torraway's cyborg character is reprised in a 1995 sequel, Mars Plus.|$|R
50|$|The SUIT sight is a 4× {{telescopic}} sight with tritium-powered illumination, utilised at dusk or dawn. The full name is the L2A2 <b>Sight</b> <b>Unit</b> Infantry Trilux. The sight is not {{designed as a}} sniper sight, but was issued to designated marksmen. The sight was mounted on the L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle or GPMG.|$|R
5000|$|The M252 system weighs 91 lb (41 kg) {{completely}} {{assembled and}} {{is composed of}} the M253 Cannon (35 lb, 16 kg), M177 Mount (27 lb, 12 kg), M3A1 Baseplate (29 lb, 13 kg), and the M64A1 <b>Sight</b> <b>Unit</b> (2.5 lb, 1.1 kg). The mount consists of a base plate and a bipod, which is provided with screw type elevating and traversing mechanisms to elevate/traverse the mortar. The M64A1 <b>sight</b> <b>unit</b> (also used on the M224) {{is attached to the}} bipod mount. The M252 is a gravity-fired smoothbore system. Attached to the muzzle of the weapon is the Blast Attenuation Device (BAD), used to reduce the blast effects on the mortar crew. To increase cooling efficiency, the breech end is finned; though first-hand accounts attest that the level of cooling is negligible. [...] The cannon also has a crew-removable breech plug and firing pin.|$|R
5000|$|The {{training}} {{level of}} the operator is critical since, unlike infrared guided missiles, the operator has to track the target exactly with the <b>sighting</b> <b>unit</b> aimpoint (SACLOS). If the aircraft detects the targeting laser, it has the whole period of the missile flight time to engage in avoidance manoeuvres, which adds additional challenge to the missile operator's target-tracking task.|$|R

50|$|The AN/PAS-13B Thermal Weapon Sight (TWS) is an <b>infrared</b> <b>sight</b> {{developed}} for the United States military by Raytheon. The sight is designed for use on small arms in the U.S. military's inventory, {{but it can also}} be used as a standalone observation device. The AN/PAS-13B uses thermal imaging so that it can be used day or night. Thermal imaging also allows the sight to see through smoke or fog, things that may normally obscure other night vision devices. The AN/PAS-13 first became operationally capable with the U.S. Army in 1998 and has reached a total production of 33,400 units.|$|R
50|$|The B-FiST has {{replaced}} the existing armored FiST vehicle (FiST-V) platform, the M981 FISTV, in the U.S. Army inventory. The TOW/UA suite is replaced by target location equipment, integrated with the Bradley ISU <b>sight</b> <b>unit.</b> It also carries equipment for use by dismounted observers. There is a hybrid GPS/inertial/dead reckoning navigation system to robustly provide the vehicle location as a reference point.|$|R
50|$|The missile is steered {{in flight}} by command {{signals from the}} {{launcher}} transmitted over a guidance wire spooled out behind the missile. A xenon lamp on {{the rear of the}} missile allows the NEC manufactured launcher <b>sight</b> <b>unit</b> to compute an offset between the missile position and line of sight to the target, and calculate steering corrections based on this offset.|$|R
50|$|The mount {{consists}} of a bipod and a base plate, which is provided with screw type elevating and traversing mechanisms to elevate/traverse the mortar. The M64A1 <b>sight</b> <b>unit</b> {{is attached to the}} bipod mount. The mortar can be fired in the conventional mode or the handheld mode. This smooth-bore system can be gravity-fired or fired by using a manual spring-loaded firing system.|$|R

50|$|In July 1958, the NIIP {{began the}} design of a new, highly advanced, mobile air-defense system. Eventually {{designated}} the 2k12 Kub (Cube), each battery consisted of a number of similar tracked vehicles, one of which carried a radar with a range of 75 km (47 mi), as well as an optical <b>sighting</b> <b>unit.</b> Several other design bureaus were involved in creating the Kub, all coordinated by Tikhomirov.|$|R
50|$|Maslennikov's Northern Group, {{in charge}} of {{defending}} Terek Valley and Georgian Military Road soon incorporated the 9th, 37th and 44th armies, however, these armies were severely depleted of manpower and ammunition; when the troops encountered a German offensive {{in the middle of}} August, the 417th Rifle Division had only 500 active men. Later they were reinforced with 100 tanks, earmarked for Baku defense, and were the first to receive experimental <b>infrared</b> <b>sights</b> and silenced sniper rifles, however, the manpower shortage persisted into 1943. Consolidation of reserves, supervised personally by Joseph Stalin, enabled Maslennikov to check 1st Panzer Army advance in Terek valley and secure Baku oil.|$|R

The {{full name}} of the current model is the SUSAT L9A1. The sight is not designed as a sniper sight, but is rather intended to be mounted {{on a variety of}} rifles and to be used by all infantrymen. A similar device is the Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight.|$|R
5000|$|The S&T Daewoo K11 DAW (Dual-barrel Air-burst Weapon) is a multi-weapon {{resembling}} the earlier US Individual Objective Combat Weapon in concept, design and operation. It {{consists of two}} separate weapons combined into a single unit: a lower assault rifle chambered to fire 5.56×45mm NATO rounds and an upper 20×30mm (caliber of shell x length of propellent case) grenade launcher firing both conventional and air-bursting [...] "smart" [...] grenades, along with its integrated digital <b>sighting</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|R
50|$|In addition, the snipers did {{not have}} the proper {{equipment}} for this hostage rescue operation. The Heckler & Koch G3 battle rifles used were considered by several experts to be inadequate for the distance at which the snipers were trying to shoot. The G3, the standard service rifle of the Bundeswehr at that time, had a 18 in barrel; at the distances the snipers were required to shoot, a 27 in barrel would have ensured far greater accuracy. None of the rifles were equipped with telescopic or <b>infrared</b> <b>sights.</b> Additionally, none of the snipers were equipped with a steel helmet or bullet-proof vest. No armored vehicles were at the scene at Fürstenfeldbruck, and were only called in after the gunfight was well underway.|$|R
50|$|Night Thrasher wore {{a special}} suit of light {{articulated}} combat armor composed of Kevlar/boro and silicate-oriented fiber in ceramic matrix, 2 layers, 8 mm/16 mm thick, and the cloth composed of micro-mail titanium nitride; he originally designed the battle-suit to survive physical combat with Silhouette's brother Midnight's Fire. The costume cannot be penetrated by bullets from conventional firearms or by knives and is fireproof. The suit is also {{composed of a}} wafer-thin L.E.D. casing that allows the suit to camouflage itself within its surroundings. The helmet contained goggles (integral) with <b>infrared</b> <b>sighting,</b> telescopic lens, magnetic resonance scanning, and camera attachment. The helmet also includes a breathing apparatus, voice scrambler, two-way radio communications device, parabolic sound enhancer, and cybernetic link to armor systems.|$|R
