40|$|To {{identify}} regions on {{the large}} T antigens of simian virus 40 (SV 40) and polyomavirus which are involved in oncogenic transformation, we constructed plasmids encoding hybrid polyomavirus-SV 40 large T antigens. The <b>hybrid</b> <b>T</b> antigens were expressed in G 418 sulfate-resistant pools of rat F 2408 cells, and extracts of such pools were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against p 53. Two <b>hybrid</b> <b>T</b> antigens containing SV 40 amino acids 337 to 708 bound to p 53, whereas another <b>hybrid</b> <b>T</b> antigen containing SV 40 amino acids 412 to 708 did not. This suggests that a binding domain on SV 40 large T antigen for p 53 is contained within amino acids 337 to 708, with amino acids 337 to 411 playing an important role. One of the two hybrids that bound to p 53 was chosen for further study. This T antigen contained SV 40 large T antigen amino acids 336 to 708 joined to polyomavirus large T antigen amino acids 1 to 521 (PyT 1 - 521 -SVT 336 - 708). Immunoprecipitation with antibodies directed against {{the product of the}} retinoblastoma susceptibility gene, p 105 -RB, showed that this hybrid bound p 105 -RB as well as p 53. Pools expressing the hybrid PyT 1 - 521 -SVT 336 - 708 did not grow in soft agar, nor did they form foci on confluent monolayers of nontransformed F 2408 cells. The <b>hybrid</b> <b>T</b> antigen was expressed at levels comparable to those seen in retrovirus-infected F 2408 cells expressing only SV 40 large T antigen, which do show a transformed phenotype. Thus, this level of expression was sufficient for transformation by SV 40 large T antigen but not for the hybrid large T antigen. These data, combined with genetic studies from other laboratories, suggest that complex formation with p 53 and p 105 -RB is necessary but not sufficient for the oncogenic potential of papovavirus large T antigens...|$|E

40|$|The {{synthetic}} terpolymer L-glutamic acid 60 -L-alanine 30 -L-tyrosine 10 (GAT) stimulates GAT-specific suppressor T {{cells in}} nonresponder mice. Extracts from these T cells contain a GAT-specific soluble T cell suppressor factor (GAT-TsF) that inhibits development of GAT-specific plaque-forming cell (PFC) responses by spleen cells from nonresponder mice stimulated with GAT complexed to methylated bovine serum albumin (GAT-MBSA). These extracts also contain {{a factor that}} inhibits development of GAT-specific proliferative responses by GAT-MBSA-primed, nonresponder lymph node T cells. Experiments reported in this manuscript show that a <b>hybrid</b> <b>T</b> cell line, produced by fusion of the AKR thymoma, BW 5147, with spleen cells that contain GAT-specific suppressor T cells, produces a constitutive GAT-specific suppresor factor that functionally and serologically resembles GAT-TsF extracted from T cells.

40|$|A {{critical}} mechanism in immune homeostasis {{is the ability}} to stop an ongoing inflammatory response once the inciting agent has been destroyed or neutralized. Failure to do so can lead to autoimmune disease. One mechanism the immune system utilizes to self regulate is the secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines. For example, the cytokine interleukin- 10 (IL 10) is a potent suppressor of numerous key immune cell populations. Among the cells that secrete IL 10 are several subsets of the CD 4 + T cell family. As CD 4 + T cells are commonly found within diseased tissue in the setting of autoimmune disease, medications capable of inducing IL 10 expression in local CD 4 + T populations would be of great therapeutic interest. The small molecule G- 1, an agonist directed against the membrane-bound estrogen receptor GPER, is known to attenuate the multiple sclerosis-like animal model EAE. However, its effects on CD 4 + T cell populations were previously unknown. Using cultures of purified CD 4 + T cells, we show that G- 1 can elicit ERK-dependent expression of IL 10. G- 1 treated cultures secreted 3 -fold more IL 10, with no change in the proinflammatory cytokines IL 17 A, TNFα, and IFNγ. Analysis of Foxp 3 and RORγt expression demonstrated increased percentages of IL 10 + cells in both the TH 17 (RORγt+) and Foxp 3 +RORγt+ <b>hybrid</b> <b>T</b> cell compartments. We also show that, in mice, in vivo treatment with G- 1 leads to increased IL 10 secretion from splenocytes. These results demonstrate that G- 1 acts directly on CD 4 + T cells, and to our knowledge provide the first example of a synthetic small molecule capable of eliciting IL 10 expression in TH 17 or <b>hybrid</b> <b>T</b> cell populations. While G- 1 treatment was not effective in a murine model of colitis, investigations of its effects in other T cell-based disease models are warranted.

40|$|Simian virus 40 T antigen {{has been}} shown {{previously}} to bind specifically with high affinity to sites within the regulatory region of double-stranded simian virus 40 DNA. Using competition filter binding and the DNA-binding immunoassay, we show that T antigen did not bind specifically to either early or late single-stranded DNA containing these binding sites. Moreover, T antigen did not bind these sequences present in single-stranded RNA, RNA/RNA duplexes, or RNA/DNA <b>hybrids.</b> <b>T</b> antigen did, however, bind as efficiently to single-stranded DNA-cellulose as to double-stranded DNA-cellulose. This binding was nonspecific because it was independent {{of the presence of}} T-antigen-binding sites. The implications of these observations are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Interspecific {{hybridization}} is {{a widespread}} phenomenon in plants that {{plays an important role}} in evolution.

In North America there are two species of cattails, original and widely distributed species Typha latifolia (Common Cattail) and probably non-native and less distributed species T. angustifolia (Narrow-leaved Cattail). It is assumed that T. angustifolia was inadvertently introduced by the first Europeans on the east coast of the continent and then spread further west. The spreading was followed by extensive hybridization with T. latifolia, which resulted in production highly invasive <b>hybrid</b> <b>T.</b> ×glauca, which rapidly spread through the vegetative growth and creates a dense monotypic stands that displace the parental and original species.
