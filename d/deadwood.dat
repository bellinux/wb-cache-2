5|$|The Swiss Ornithological Institute {{has set up}} a {{monitoring}} program to record breeding populations of woodland birds. This has shown that <b>deadwood</b> is an important habitat requirement for the black woodpecker, great spotted woodpecker, middle spotted woodpecker, lesser spotted woodpecker, European green woodpecker and Eurasian three-toed woodpecker. Populations of all these species increased by varying amounts in the period 1990 to 2008. During this period, the amount of <b>deadwood</b> in the forest increased and the range of the white-backed woodpecker enlarged as it extended eastwards. With the exception of the green and middle spotted woodpeckers, the increase in the amount of <b>deadwood</b> {{is likely to be the}} major factor explaining the population increase of these species.|$|E
5|$|Zion National Park {{has been}} {{featured}} in numerous films, including The <b>Deadwood</b> Coach (1924), Arizona Bound (1927), Nevada (1927), Ramrod (1947) and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969).|$|E
25|$|Langrishe was an {{integral}} player in shaping <b>Deadwood’s</b> early history as he participated in civic endeavors such as Fourth of July event planning and fund raising for health charities. The Langrishe Company’s benefit performance October 14, 1876 donated receipts totaling over $73 to <b>Deadwood’s</b> hospital kitty.|$|R
5000|$|The {{issue of}} the {{authenticity}} of <b>Deadwoods</b> dialogue has even been alluded to in the show itself. Early in the second season, E.B. Farnum has fleeced Mr. Wolcott of $9,900, and Farnum tries to console the geologist: ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, Buck played Mrs. Prest in an {{adaptation}} of The Aspern Papers, a Henry James novella, directed by first-time filmmaker Mariana Hellmund. She played Marguerite Duras in Irina Brooks La Vie Materielle that spring and again in 2013 at La MaMa E.T.C. theater in New York City alongside <b>Deadwoods</b> Nicole Ansari ...|$|R
5|$|Another {{important}} {{sector in}} South Dakota's economy is tourism. Many travel {{to view the}} attractions of the state, particularly those in the Black Hills region, such as historic <b>Deadwood,</b> Mount Rushmore, and the nearby state and national parks. One of the largest tourist events in the state is the annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. The five-day event drew over 739,000 attendees in 2015; significant considering {{the state has a}} total population of 850,000. In 2006, tourism provided an estimated 33,000 jobs in the state and contributed over two billion dollars to the economy of South Dakota.|$|E
5|$|Rivers in Boise National Forest {{offer the}} {{opportunity}} for rafting and kayaking through rapids up to class four, with the most difficult sections on the South Fork and main stems of the Payette River. Numerous developed boat launch sites provide access to rivers for whitewater enthusiasts, and Dagger Falls is the primary launching site for visitors to the Middle Fork of the Salmon River and Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness. Motorized boating is permitted on Anderson Ranch Reservoir, <b>Deadwood</b> Reservoir, and Warm Lake.|$|E
5|$|Few Myxogastria {{species are}} found in the tropics and subtropics, mainly because of the high {{humidity}} which prevents the necessary dehydration of the fruit bodies to permit spore dispersal and promotes infestation by moulds. Other factors are low light levels under the forest canopy which reduces phototaxis, light winds, poor soils, natural enemies and heavy rainfall which can wash away or destroy cells. Species living in soil or <b>deadwood</b> decrease as humidity increases. In a study from Costa Rica, 73% of the total findings were in the relatively dry Tropical Moist Forest, while 18% were in the very moist Tropical Premontane Wet Forests and only 9% in Lower Premontane Rain Forest.|$|E
50|$|Alma Garret and Ellsworth marry at a {{ceremony}} conducted by Andy Cramed at the Grand Central hotel. After much dealing and double-dealing {{on the part of}} Swearengen and Silas Adams, the official papers confirming <b>Deadwood's</b> annexation into Yankton territory are signed by Bullock and Swearengen with Hugo Jarry present. Andy Cramed stabs Tolliver outside the Bella Union.|$|R
50|$|Before {{undertaking}} {{works in}} the UK, arborists have a legal responsibility to survey trees for wildlife, especially bats, which are afforded particular legal protection. In addition, any tree in the UK can be covered by a tree preservation order and {{it is illegal to}} conduct any work on a tree, including <b>deadwooding</b> or pruning, before permission has been sought from the local council.|$|R
5000|$|Al Swearengen negotiates with George Hearst {{on behalf}} of Mr. Wu, and they agree that Wu can regain his status if his people prove to be better workers {{than those of the}} [...] "San Francisco cocksucker" [...] Lee. Mr. Wu and Swearengen's henchmen plan vengeance in <b>Deadwood's</b> Chinatown. The {{operation}} is successful and Wu slits the throat of his rival.|$|R
5|$|South Dakota's culture {{reflects}} the state's American Indian, rural, Western, and European roots. A number of annual events celebrating the state's ethnic and historical heritage take place around the state, such as Days of '76 in <b>Deadwood,</b> Czech Days in Tabor, {{and the annual}} St. Patrick's Day and Cinco de Mayo festivities in Sioux Falls. The various tribes hold many annual pow wows at their reservations throughout the state, to which non-Native Americans are sometimes invited. Custer State Park holds an annual Buffalo Roundup, in which volunteers on horseback gather the park's herd of around 1,500 bison.|$|E
5|$|Before {{creating}} True Detective, Nic Pizzolatto {{had taught}} at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, DePauw University, and the University of Chicago. Inspired by HBO's series The Wire, The Sopranos, and <b>Deadwood,</b> he began working on a short story collection that he later published as Between Here and the Yellow Sea in 2006. He published a novel, Galveston, in 2010, and began trying to write for television. His earlier attempts at television writing were unsuccessful {{because of a lack}} of money. Pizzolatto's first major gig in television writing came in 2011, as a screenwriter for AMC's series The Killing. He credits the show with giving him a glimpse of the inner workings of the television industry. Pizzolatto grew increasingly dissatisfied with the series' creative direction, and left two weeks into staff writing sessions for its second season.|$|E
5|$|The species grows only on {{slightly}} to heavily rotten and barkless <b>deadwood</b> in coniferous forests in cool, moist areas. The wood is about 40 to 100% overgrown with Marchantiophyta, {{especially of the}} genera Nowellia or Cephalozia. B.minutissima has been found growing on the liverwort Lepidozia reptans, although Nowellia curvifolia is the main indicator for the slime mould. In addition to liverworts, Barbeyella is found socialised with monocellular algae. It is assumed that the protoplasmodium phagocytises either the algae or the bacteria on their surface. Other Myxogastria species are often found together with Barbeyella, especially Lepidoderma tigrinum, Lamproderma columbinum and Colloderma oculatum. Aphanocladium album is a myxomyceticolous fungus (i.e., living on or within the fruit bodies of myxomycetes) that has been reported growing on specimens of B.minutissima collected from North Carolina.|$|E

50|$|In 1899, {{however, the}} Gem burned down once again, and a penniless Swearengen {{declined}} to rebuild {{and left for}} Colorado. Despite the Gem's history as <b>Deadwood's</b> longest-lived entertainment institution, its support by {{so many of the}} town power brokers over the years, and the glowing tributes in the press after the rebuilt Gem was unveiled, after its demise it was reviled in the press as an evil institution and a town shame.|$|R
5000|$|When {{a player}} has {{gotten rid of}} all of their cards, he declare [...] "Game" [...] and wins the hand. This {{is the same as}} [...] "Going Out" [...] or [...] "Knocking" [...] in other Rummy variants. All other players start to total up the points of their <b>deadwoods,</b> which may include any wildcards. They cannot play on even though they still have melds or {{lay-offs}} that they can play in hand.|$|R
5|$|Of the 28 {{fish species}} {{present in the}} forest, 11 are not native and have been {{introduced}} by humans. Rainbow trout, chinook salmon, westslope cutthroat trout, bull trout, and mountain whitefish are all native {{to some of the}} forest's waterways, while brook trout are a common invasive species that compete with the forest's salmonids. The forest's management indicator species is bull trout because they are sensitive to habitat changes and depend on specific habitat conditions. Sockeye salmon are native to the Salmon River watershed {{in the northern part of}} the forest, but dam construction on the Columbia and Snake rivers has hampered the migration of this anadromous fish and caused its population to collapse. Warm Lake supports the forest's only native population of Kokanee salmon, the resident (non-migratory) form of sockeye salmon. However, due to introductions by humans, Anderson Ranch, Arrowrock, Lucky Peak, and <b>Deadwood</b> reservoirs now support populations of Kokanee salmon. To provide additional recreational fishing opportunities, the Idaho Department of Fish and Game stocks several of the forest's waterways with rainbow trout, while reservoirs are also stocked with Kokanee or chinook salmon and Lake Cascade is stocked with coho salmon and steelhead, the anadromous form of rainbow trout.|$|E
25|$|Bonsai growers {{create or}} shape dead wood using {{techniques}} such as jin and shari to simulate age and maturity in a bonsai. Jin is the term used when the bark from an entire branch is removed to create {{the impression of a}} snag of <b>deadwood.</b> Shari denotes stripping bark from areas of the trunk to simulate natural scarring from a broken limb or lightning strike. In addition to stripping bark, <b>deadwood</b> techniques may also involve the use of tools to scar the <b>deadwood</b> or to raise its grain, and the application of chemicals (usually lime sulfur) to bleach and preserve the exposed <b>deadwood.</b>|$|E
25|$|At Carroll, Montana, {{they found}} a steamboat, on which they took passage to Bismarck, from which point Aaron and his party came through with ox teams to the Black Hills, {{arriving}} in <b>Deadwood</b> in October, 1876, and having managed to avoid attack from the Indians while en route. He passed a month in mining in <b>Deadwood</b> Gulch and then joined the stampede to Wolf Mountain, but the prospects there turned out a failure and he returned {{in a few weeks}} to <b>Deadwood.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bullock {{took his}} job seriously, deputizing several {{residents}} and tackling {{the job of}} civilizing the camp. Despite (or perhaps because of) a reputation for fearlessness and an uncompromising nature, Bullock managed the task without killing anyone. Bullock had several 'run ins' with Al Swearengen, proprietor of the notorious Gem Theater, <b>Deadwood's</b> most notable brothel. Swearengen {{had a knack for}} making money from vice and shrewdly invested some of his profits in cultivating alliances with the camp's wealthy and powerful.|$|R
5000|$|The Gem prospered, {{bringing}} {{in an average}} of $5,000 a night, even reaching as high as $10,000. Swearengen forged alliances with many of <b>Deadwood's</b> most prominent citizens, buying himself immunity from legal or other problems. His immunity even extended to the notoriously upright and incorruptible Marshal Seth Bullock, {{who did not have}} the political clout to extend his campaign to clean up the town as far as the lower regions of Main Street, which remained Swearengen's territory.|$|R
5000|$|The {{effect is}} that the player can no longer reduce <b>deadwoods</b> in his hand, and {{therefore}} stuck with all the points in the dead hand. Even subsequently when there are new melds that the player could {{have been able to}} lay off more cards, he cannot do so because he is out of the game. So it is desirable to delay declaring [...] "Dead" [...] as much as possible. In other words, players try real hard to keep his hand alive.|$|R
25|$|Swearengen's {{talent for}} making canny alliances and {{financial}} payoffs kept him {{insulated from the}} general drive to clean up <b>Deadwood,</b> including the otherwise successful work of Seth Bullock, the town's first sheriff, until the Gem burned down once again in 1899. Swearengen left <b>Deadwood</b> and remarried the same year to Odelia Turgeon.|$|E
25|$|Having {{attained}} some {{stability in}} <b>Deadwood,</b> Bullock brought his wife Martha Eccles Bullock and daughter to town from her parents' home in Michigan, {{where they had}} been living during this period. They had one daughter, Margaret, at the time of Martha's arrival in <b>Deadwood,</b> and they subsequently had another daughter, Florence, and a son, Stanley.|$|E

5000|$|Den of Geek gave it 4.5 stars, saying [...] "Sometimes I {{worry that}} the writers of Once Upon a Time have {{developed}} the technology to record my innermost desires without my knowledge or consent. I am not paranoid, I am just proposing a logical supposition {{based on the fact}} that tonight they had <b>Deadwood’s</b> Calamity Jane playing Little Bo Peep, cockney warlord. While I can’t, admittedly, say that this was a specific dream of mine, seeing it on screen tonight made it abundantly clear that this was something my heart needed to witness." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Deadwood’s</b> climate varies {{considerably}} {{from the rest}} of the state and surrounding areas. While most of the state receives less than 25 in of precipitation per year, annual precipitation amounts in the Lead—Deadwood area reach nearly 30 in. Despite a mean annual snowfall of 102.9 in, warm chinook winds are frequent enough that the median snow cover is zero even in January, although during cold spells after big snowstorms there can be considerable snow on the ground. On November 6, 2008, after a storm had deposited 45.7 in of snow, with a water equivalent of 4.25 in, 35 in of snow lay on the ground.|$|R
5000|$|It may be {{that she}} exaggerated this story, or even {{completely}} fabricated it. Even during her lifetime, not everyone accepted her version as true. A popular belief is that she instead acquired it {{as a result of}} her warnings to men that to offend her was to [...] "court calamity". It is possible that [...] "Jane" [...] was not part of her name until the nickname was coined for her. It is certain, however, that she was known by that nickname by 1876, because the arrival of the Hickok wagon train was reported in <b>Deadwood's</b> newspaper the Black Hills Pioneer on July 15, 1876, with the headline: [...] "Calamity Jane has arrived!" ...|$|R
25|$|Bullock died {{of colon}} cancer shortly thereafter, on September 23, 1919, at his home at 28 Van Buren Street in <b>Deadwood.</b> He is buried in Mount Moriah Cemetery in <b>Deadwood,</b> along with Wild Bill Hickok and Calamity Jane, with his grave facing Mount Roosevelt. Bullock's grave is more than 750 {{feet away from the}} main {{cemetery}} grounds.|$|E

25|$|Langrishe {{arrived with}} his wife Jeannette and their Company in <b>Deadwood,</b> South Dakota on July 15, 1876 and their first {{performance}} was held at The Bella Union. Langrishe along with treasurer and troupe manager Jonas Hellawell, leased the McDaniels Theatre July 22, 1876 from Cheyenne, Wyoming theatre manager James McDaniels, who constructed the first theatre in <b>Deadwood.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Court {{held that}} a person should not receive {{compensation}} for injuries sustained when he is experienced in his work {{and there is no}} evidence of negligence or extenuating circumstances. Kohn had argued that the Company was negligent in exposing Kohn to cars that were different from the ones he was used to handling. The Court disagreed, reasoning that he was a mature and experienced man who should have been able to cope with the existing conditions. The train cars were not in defective in any way, they had the double <b>deadwoods</b> or bumpers of unusual length and were constructed differently, but this should have been obvious even at a passing glance. Kohn had already been working there for two months, long enough to know the risks.|$|R
5000|$|Calamity Jane {{was buried}} at Mount Moriah Cemetery, South Dakota next to Wild Bill Hickok. Four {{of the men}} who planned her funeral later stated that Wild Bill Hickok had [...] "absolutely no use" [...] for Jane while he was alive, so they decided to play a posthumous joke on him by giving her a resting place by his side. Another account states: [...] "in {{compliance}} with Jane's dying requests, the Society of Black Hills Pioneers took charge of her funeral and burial in Mount Moriah Cemetery beside Wild Bill. Not just old friends, but the morbidly curious and many who would not have acknowledged Calamity Jane when she was alive, overflowed the First Methodist Church for the funeral services on August 4 and followed the hearse up the steep winding road to <b>Deadwood’s</b> boot hill".|$|R
50|$|In {{building}} a simple pulling boat, the keel, hog, stem, apron, <b>deadwoods,</b> sternpost and perhaps transom are assembled and securely set up. In normal practice, {{this will be}} the same way up as they will be in use. From the hog, the garboard, bottom, bilge, topside and sheer strakes are planked up, held together along their lands by copper rivets. At the stem and, in a double-ended boat, the sternpost, geralds are formed. That is, in each case, the land of the lower strake is tapered to a feather edge {{at the end of the}} strake where it meets the stem or stern-post. This allows the end of the strake to be screwed to the apron with the outside of the planking mutually flush at that point and flush with the stem. This means that the boat's passage through the water will not tend to lift the ends of the planking away from the stem. Before the next plank is laid up, the face of the land on the lower strake is bevelled to suit the angle at which the next strake will lie in relation with it. This varies all along the land. Gripes are used to hold the new strake in position on the preceding one before the fastening is done.|$|R
