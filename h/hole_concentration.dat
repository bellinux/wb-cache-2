50|$|A {{flurry of}} {{research}} {{in the past few years}} has shed some light on the crucial factors that are needed to achieve high-Curie temperature (above room temperature) ferromagnetic semiconductors, which can explain the so-called controversy in the field and lack of reproducibility in the magnetic properties for the same materials. Indeed, the first great discovery in the field was in 1986 by T. Story and co-workers where they demonstrated that the ferromagnetic Curie temperature of Mn2+-doped Pb1−xSnxTe can be controlled by the carrier concentration. The theory proposed by Dietl required charge carriers in the case of holes to mediate the magnetic coupling of manganese dopants in the prototypical magnetic semiconductor, Mn2+-doped GaAs. If there is an insufficient <b>hole</b> <b>concentration</b> in the magnetic semiconductor, then the Curie temperature would be very low or would exhibit only paramagnetism. However, if the <b>hole</b> <b>concentration</b> is high (~1020 cm−3), then the Curie temperature would be higher, between 100-200 K.|$|E

Redshifts in the GaAs-like optical modes due to alloying are evaluated and are paralleled by strong damping of the LOPC. The relative integrated Raman intensities of LO(Γ) and LOPC ALO/ALOPC {{are characteristic of}} heavily doped p-GaAs, with a remarkable near total screening of the LO(Γ) phonon (ALO/ALOPC → 0) for larger Bi concentrations. A method of spectral analysis is set out which yields estimates of <b>hole</b> <b>concentrations</b> in excess of 5 × 1017 cm− 3 and correlates with the Bi molar fraction. These findings are in general agreement with recent electrical transport measurements performed on the alloy, and while the absolute size of the <b>hole</b> <b>concentrations</b> differ, likely origins for the discrepancy are discussed.

40|$|The {{electronic}} {{structure and the}} <b>hole</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the high Tc superconductor HgBa 2 CuO(4 +delta) (delta = O, 1) has been investigated by employing a first principles full potential self-consistent LMTO method with the local density functional theory. The scalar relativistic effects have been considered. The <b>hole</b> <b>concentrations</b> of the Cu-d and O-p(x,y) orbitals are seen to be larger for the HgBaCuO 5 system {{than those of the}} HgBaCuO 4 solid. However, the van Hove singularity (vHs) induced Cu-d and O-p peak which is seen to lie comparatively away and above the Fermi level in the delta = 1 system shifts towards the Fermi level in the delta = 0 system. Thus, the superconducting behavior appears to originate from the occurrence of the vHs peak at the Fermi level. The Fermi surface nesting area in the delta = 0 compound is seen to be larger than in the delta = 1 compound. The calculation reveals that the increase in pressure on the crystal enhances the <b>hole</b> <b>concentrations</b> but without showing any optimum value, On the other hand, the vHs peak approaches to-wards the Fermi level with pressure and crosses the Fermi surface near V/Vo approximately equals 0. 625 (V and Vo are the crystal volumes at high and normal pressures, respectively). Our calculated value of the bulk modulus equal to 0. 626 Mbar predicts the occurrence of this crossover at about 24 GPa which is in complete agreement with the experimental value.

50|$|All high {{performance}} CIGS absorbers in solar cells have similarities independent of production technique. First, they are polycrystalline α-phase {{which has the}} chalcopyrite crystal structure shown in Figure 3. The second property is an overall Cu deficiency. Cu deficiency increases the majority carrier (<b>hole)</b> <b>concentration</b> by {{increasing the number of}} (electron-accepting) Cu vacancies. When CIGS films are In rich (Cu deficient) the film's surface layer forms an ordered defect compound (ODC) with a stoichiometry of Cu(In,Ga)3Se5. The ODC is n-type, forming a p-n homojunction in the film at the interface between the α phase and the ODC. The recombination velocity at the CIGS/CdS interface is decreased by the homojunction's presence. The drop in interface recombination attributable to ODC formation is demonstrated by experiments which have shown that recombination in the bulk of the film is the main loss mechanism in Cu deficient films, while in Cu rich films the main loss is at the CIGS/CdS interface.|$|E
