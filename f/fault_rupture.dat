5|$|The {{earthquake}} {{was recorded}} on Gray-Milne-Ewing seismographs at weather observation stations at Gifu, Nagoya, Osaka, and Tokyo {{as well as}} a station housed at the Imperial University of Tokyo. Although the units went off scale after 8.5 seconds at Gifu and 13.5 seconds at Nagoya (probably due to an inundation of large S-waves) the seismograms they produced have been beneficial for seismologists to develop an understanding of the <b>fault</b> <b>rupture</b> process. The records from the stations at Gifu and Nagoya were especially useful as they were the closest to the fault zone.|$|E
25|$|The {{pressure}} wave from an underground explosion will propagate through {{the ground and}} cause a minor earthquake. Theory suggests that a nuclear explosion could trigger <b>fault</b> <b>rupture</b> and cause a major quake at distances within a few tens of kilometers from the shot point.|$|E
25|$|Many {{structures}} {{near the}} bay shore {{on either side}} would probably be severely affected by either a major Hayward <b>Fault</b> <b>rupture</b> or a nearby San Andreas <b>Fault</b> <b>rupture.</b> Severe effects were seen in both Oakland and northern San Francisco from the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, even though this event was not extremely large and was centered a significant distance away in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Most of the severe effects of that event were due to poorly responding soil conditions and design deficiencies in large structures. Only {{a portion of the}} structural deficiencies in the larger area have been addressed, and the surface motion effects of a large event are likely to be far more severe than seen in the Loma Prieta event.|$|E

It is often used in design of earthquake-proof structures today, particularly for the time history analysis method.|$|E
25|$|The {{magnitude}} of an earthquake, as indicated on a seismic scale, is roughly {{proportional to the}} length of the rupture, while the ground motion in the region surrounding the fault is highly dependent upon the local soil conditions, somewhat upon the distance and relationship to the progression of the <b>fault</b> <b>rupture,</b> and (as recently recognized in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake) reflected energy from deep discontinuities in the Earth's structure. The area affected by an earthquake is also dependent upon the density and uniformity of the soils surrounding the fault.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Earthquakes and {{submarine}} landslides are recurrent {{and widespread}} manifestations of fault activity offshore SW Iberia. The present work tests {{the effects of}} sea-level rise on offshore fault systems using Coulomb stress change calculations across the Alentejo margin. Large-scale faults capable of generating large earthquakes and tsunamis in the region, especially NE–SW trending thrusts and WNW–ESE trending dextral strike-slip faults imaged at basement depths, are either blocked or unaffected by flexural effects related to sealevel changes. Large-magnitude earthquakes occurring along these structures may, therefore, be less frequent during periods of sea-level rise. In contrast, sea-level rise promotes shallow <b>fault</b> <b>ruptures</b> within the sedimentary sequence along the continental slope and upper rise within distances of < 100 km from the coast. The {{results suggest that the}} occurrence of continental slope failures may either increase (if triggered by shallow <b>fault</b> <b>ruptures)</b> or decrease (if triggered by deep <b>fault</b> <b>ruptures)</b> as a result of sea-level rise. Moreover, observations of slope failures affecting the area of the Sines contourite drift highlight the role of sediment properties as preconditioning factors in this region. Versión del edito...|$|R
5000|$|The Sagaing Fault {{is a major}} {{fault in}} Burma, a {{continental}} transform fault between the Indian plate and Sunda Plate that connects spreading centers in the Andaman Sea and the continental convergence zone along the Himalayan front. It passes through populated cities of Mandalay, Yamethin, Pyinmana, the capital Naypyidaw, Toungoo and Pegu before dropping off into the Gulf of Martaban, over 1200 kilometers. [...] Global Positioning System campaigns revealed a right-lateral slip rate of 18 mm/yr. [...] Different segments of the <b>fault</b> <b>ruptured</b> in May-1930, Dec-1930, 1931 and 1946. The <b>fault</b> <b>ruptured</b> in 1930, causing a Magnitude 7.3 quake and likely a local tsunami at Bago, causing over 500 deaths.|$|R
25|$|The {{surface of}} the fault is {{creeping}} at less than 0.5cm (0.2in) {{per year in the}} regions of concern. Extreme southern regions of the fault are creeping more quickly, perhaps sufficiently to prevent <b>fault</b> <b>rupture</b> there, but mostly the creep is insufficient to relieve the accumulating forces upon most of the fault and so will not prevent a large earthquake. The creep is sufficient to displace roads, curbs, and sidewalks and so visibly reveal the surface trace in many locations. Creep damage to asphalt road surfaces will usually appear as a series of echelon cracks. Creep effects may be seen also in older structures crossing the fault, some of which have been fitted with expansion joints to accommodate this slow motion.|$|E
25|$|The 1940 El Centro {{earthquake}} (or 1940 Imperial Valley earthquake) {{occurred at}} 21:35 Pacific Standard Time on May 18 (05:35 UTC on May 19) in the Imperial Valley in southeastern Southern California near the international {{border of the}} United States and Mexico. It had a moment magnitude of 6.9 and a maximum perceived intensity of X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. It {{was the first major}} earthquake to be recorded by a strong-motion seismograph located next to a <b>fault</b> <b>rupture.</b> The earthquake was characterized as a typical moderate-sized destructive event with a complex energy release signature. It was the strongest recorded earthquake to hit the Imperial Valley, and caused widespread damage to irrigation systems and led to the deaths of nine people.|$|E
500|$|Seismologists {{thoroughly}} {{studied the}} effects of the Spitak event, including the mainshock and aftershock <b>fault</b> <b>rupture</b> mechanisms and were on site setting up temporary seismometers before the end of 1988. Earthquake engineering experts scrutinized [...] building construction styles and found fault in the poorly constructed apartments and other buildings that were built during the Era of Stagnation under the rule of Leonid Brezhnev. The cities of Spitak, Leninakan (Gyumri), and Kirovakan (Vanadzor) were greatly affected with large losses of life and devastating effects to buildings and other structures. A number of the smaller outlying villages away from the larger population centers were also severely affected.|$|E

500|$|The {{source of}} the event was a <b>fault</b> <b>rupture</b> [...] south of the Caucasus Mountains, a {{mountain}} range that has been produced by the convergence of the Arabian and the Eurasian tectonic plates. The range is situated along an active seismic belt that stretches from the Alps in southern Europe to the Himalayas in Asia. The seismicity along this belt is marked by frequent major earthquakes from the Aegean Sea, through Turkey and Iran, and into Afghanistan. Though the recurrence of seismic events in Armenia does not reach the high frequency that is seen in other segments of this zone, rapid crustal deformation there is associated with active thrust faulting and volcanic activity. Mount Ararat, a [...] dormant volcano, lies [...] {{to the south of}} the quake's epicenter in Turkey.|$|E
500|$|The three cities {{closest to}} the <b>fault</b> <b>rupture</b> {{experienced}} different levels of damage. Both Leninakan and Kirovakan were roughly equidistant from the shock, yet Leninakan had greater damage. This {{may be explained by}} a [...] sedimentary layer that is present beneath the city. The Earthquake Engineering Research Institute's team compared building damage in each city and observed similar results when comparing stone buildings four stories or less in height, but for taller frame-stone buildings, 62% were destroyed at Leninakan while only 23% collapsed at Kirovakan. While on site during aftershock monitoring, the US research team verified the presence of soil amplification effects when pronounced difference in readings were observed when compared with nearby rock sites. Uneven distribution of the seismic energy may have also contributed to the fluctuation in damage.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{accounts}} of the event indicate the presence of foreshocks between one and nine hours before the main event, {{and based on the}} (uncertain) distribution of those shocks, it is assumed that the beginning of the <b>fault</b> <b>rupture</b> (the epicenter) was in the area between Parkfield and Cholame, about [...] northwest.|$|E

2500|$|The Calaveras Fault is {{considered}} to be continuous from the Sunol area south to Hollister. It was long believed that there was no connection between the Hayward Fault and the Calaveras. Recent geological studies (particularly the examination of very small and deep earthquakes) suggest that the two faults may be connected. If true, this would have significant implications for the potential maximum strength of earthquakes on the Hayward, since this strength is determined by the maximum length of the <b>fault</b> <b>rupture</b> and this rupture could extend beyond the juncture point and so include some portion of the Calaveras.

2500|$|The {{earthquake}} {{was caused}} by the sudden rupture and motion along a strike-slip fault, [...] beneath Lincolnshire. Earthquake motion occurred over a time span of ~2minutes but it was most intense and was felt at the surface for just 10 to 30 seconds; maximum vertical ground motion at the epicentre of the earthquake was only ~1mm. Computer calculations carried out by the British Geological Survey (BGS) imply sinistral motion on a N–S or dextral motion on a E–W oriented strike-slip fault. The nine aftershocks observed, ~ SSW of the main earthquake event, point to an approximately N–S oriented fault. From the 5.2 ML magnitude of the main earthquake, a motion of a few centimetres along a ~ long <b>fault</b> <b>rupture</b> is derived. The energy released was 3.98×1012 joules (equal to the detonation of ~950 tonnes of TNT).|$|E

These buildings suffered the most damage, with four buildings totally collapsing, which resulted in a large loss of life at the facility. Most of the masonry and reinforced concrete buildings constructed after 1933 withstood the shaking and most did not collapse, but in 1972 a resolution came forth to abandon the site and the remaining structures were later demolished, the site becoming a city park.|$|E
