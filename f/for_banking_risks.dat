The fact that contemporary <b>bank</b> <b>risk</b> management employs many of the important theoretical and methodological advances in our field is a source of collective pride.

40|$|DEPOSIT INSURANCE PROVIDED by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) violates a basic {{principle}} of insurance: premiums are not adjusted <b>for</b> <b>bank</b> <b>risk.</b> Thus, <b>banks</b> have {{the incentive to}} take on more risk, increasing the insurer's liability but not the banks' costs (see Keeton 1984). This incentive is heightened further by the FDIC's timidity in closing failed banks. If uninsured depositors and other creditors were {{able and willing to}} evaluate <b>bank</b> <b>risk</b> and demand risk-adjusted returns on investments, the incentive for risk-taking would be weakened, since, in such a world, deposit insurance could be fairly priced (see Thomson 1987). When asymmetric information concerning both bank risktaking and insurer behavior characterizes the banking market [as Crane (1976); Avery, Belton, and Goldberg (1988); Keeton and Morris (1987); and Brewer and Lee (1986) all suggest to be the case], other remedies must be sought. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract__ Cyclicality in {{the losses}} of bank loans is {{important}} <b>for</b> <b>bank</b> <b>risk</b> management. Because loans {{have a different}} risk profile than bonds, evidence of cyclicality in bond losses need not apply to loans. Based on unique data we show that the default rate and loss given default of bank loans share a cyclical component, related to the business cycle. We infer this cycle by a new model that distinguishes loans with large and small losses, and links them to the default rate and macro variables. The loss distributions within the groups stay constant, but the fraction of loans with large losses increases during downturns. Our model implies substantial time-variation in banks' capital reserves, and helps predicting the losses...|$|R

First, sovereign bond holdings are heterogeneous across banks. Larger, weakly capitalised banks and banks with a small depositor base hold more sovereign bonds. Around 31 % of all German banks hold no sovereign bonds at all. Second, the sensitivity of banks to macroeconomic factors increased significantly in the post-Lehman period. Banks hold more bonds from euro area countries, from low-inflation countries, and from countries with high sovereign bond yields. Third, there has been no marked impact of sovereign bond holdings on <b>bank</b> <b>risk.</b> This result could indicate the widespread absence of marking-to-market for sovereign bond holdings {{at the onset of the}} sovereign debt crisis in Europe...|$|R

40|$|Arguing that a {{relatively}} high cost of deposit insurance indicates that a <b>bank</b> takes excessive <b>risks,</b> this article estimates the cost of deposit insurance for a large sample of banks in 14 economies to assess {{the relationship between the}} risk-taking behavior of banks and their corporate governance structure.

Expansion into noninterest income-generating activities such as trading increases the rate of return on assets, and it could offer some risk diversification benefits at very low levels. Nondeposit, wholesale funding in contrast lowers the rate of return on assets, while it can offer some risk reduction at commonly observed low levels of nondeposit funding. A sizable proportion of banks, however, attract most of their short-term funding in the form of nondeposits at a cost of enhanced bank fragility. Overall, banking strategies that rely prominently on generating noninterest income or attracting nondeposit funding are very risky, consistent with the demise of the US investment banking sector.

In addition, we find that banks that rely on wholesale funding tend to increase mortgage loans in a prolonged low rate environment. This is suggestive evidence that these banks may be taking on more liquidity risk by supplying long-term loans with short-term funding.

Relying on an original dataset of 20 large US banks, we find that asset-backed securitization tends to increase credit risk of the issuing bank. We also perform cross-sectional analysis to examine the effect of securitization by asset type, and find that the positive effect of securitization on credit risk is primarily driven by the securitization of unsecured loans such as credit cards and other consumer loans. Finally, examining the possible impact of Basel II on banksÃ¢Â€Â™ securitization activities reveals a marked decrease in the positive effect of asset-backed securitization on banksÃ¢Â€Â™ credit risk subsequent to the announcement of the New Accord in 2004.

40|$|The {{stochastic}} {{volatility of}} daily foreign exchange (FX) derivatives poses {{a number of}} <b>risks</b> <b>for</b> the international <b>banking</b> community. Settlement <b>risk,</b> liquidity risk and capital adequacy {{are just a few}} immediate concerns that arise from such volatility. This thesis examines the impact of close-out netting on minimising the stochastic volatility of inter-bank FX derivatives. The problem with close-out netting is that although it is a simple formula of taking the differences between two banks at one point in time, it is the stochastic and volatile nature of FX rates that makes measuring the full impact of netting difficult. The objective of this thesis is to establish a realistic international banking framework or modelling environment in which close-out netting can be scientifically applied and examined. Five international daily FX rates will be used as sufficient approximations <b>for</b> five international <b>banks.</b> A generalised autoregressive conditionally heteroschedastic (GARCH) modelling approach is adopted as a robust and rich FX volatility paradigm. Then through Monte Carlo simulation of the resulting fitted GARCH models, we generate the distributions -with and without close-out netting. The findings of this thesis are interesting, showing that close-out netting is far more than just a simple mathematical process. Netting surely does reduce each bank&# 039;s exposure to FX volatility, however, its multivariate nature reveals some important results <b>for</b> <b>banking</b> <b>risk</b> research and <b>bank</b> analysts...|$|R
