Jones' father {{spent most of her}} childhood in the Air Force and later in state prison. When Jones was in third grade, her family settled {{in the basement of a}} Des Moines Salvation Army church. During the summer when day camps were offered at the church, Jones would wake up early to avoid being teased by other kids <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> out she was living in the basement.|$|E
25|$|The 2007 {{documentary}} America the Beautiful explores how {{the fashion}} and beauty industries {{are contributing to}} the problems that individuals feel regarding body image due to their beauty obsession. The film discusses {{a wide range of}} topics like plastic surgery, dieting, eating disorders, the modeling industry along with the fashion industry and much more. Young middle-school aged girls were portrayed {{in the beginning of the}} film and asked <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> themselves beautiful. The girls who are around the ages of 13 had decided that they were not beautiful. In today's society, people are starting to see themselves as ugly at an earlier age than ever before. As individuals who identify as ugly increase, the number of body image issues also increase.|$|E
500|$|Reich {{was taught}} at home {{until he was}} 12, when his mother was {{discovered}} {{having an affair with}} his live-in tutor. Reich wrote about the affair in 1920 in his first published paper, [...] "Über einen Fall von Durchbruch der Inzestschranke" [...] ("About a Case of Breaching the Incest Taboo"), presented in the third person as though about a patient. He wrote that he would follow his mother when she went to the tutor's bedroom at night, feeling ashamed and jealous, and wondering if they would kill him <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> out that he knew. He briefly thought of forcing her to have sex with him, on pain of threatening to tell his father. In the end, he did tell his father, and after a protracted period of beatings, his mother committed suicide in 1910, for which Reich blamed himself.|$|E

He had no prior {{intention}} to leave Hungary until he learned from his mother that the Hungarian Secret Police were looking for him. Racz said <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> him, [...] "That would have meant the end of my dreams to become a doctor. Perhaps I would have ended up in prison. Not that I had done anything but many other people ended up in prison following 1956 without committing any crime." [...] He arrived in the Austrian town of Eisenstadt where buses were waiting to take refugees to their new homes. Racz chose the bus to England, and he along with his family and other members of his group were transported to a military base in the Midlands.|$|E
500|$|... "Chatterbox" [...] {{was written}} and sung by Thunders, whom Willis felt [...] "uses {{his voice as}} a wailing instrument" [...] {{in a manner similar}} to rock singer Robert Plant. The song was Thunders's first time singing lead and {{featured}} vocals Weisbard and Marks said were delivered in a quavering but proud New York accent. His lyrics described the narrator's growing frustration over a crossed-wire phone connection with a female subject. On [...] "Human Being", an ode to self-respect and personal liberty, Thunders introduced his guitar playing with a roughly performed variation on Bill Doggett's 1956 song [...] "Honky Tonk". Johansen addressed critics of the band in the song, telling them <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> him objectionable they should instead find themselves [...] "a saint", [...] "a boy who's gonna be what I ain't", and a [...] "plastic doll with a fresh coat of paint who's gonna sit through the madness and always act so quaint".|$|E
500|$|Judge Mathes's {{instructed}} {{the jury that}} <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> that Kawakita had genuinely believed {{he was no longer}} a U.S. citizen, then he must be found not guilty of treason. [...] During the course of their deliberations, the jury reported several times that they were hopelessly deadlocked, but the judge insisted each time that they continue trying to reach a unanimous verdict. [...] In the end—on September 2, 1948—the jury found Kawakita guilty of eight of the thirteen counts of treason against him, and he was sentenced to death. [...] As a consequence of his conviction for treason, Kawakita's U.S. citizenship was also revoked. [...] In passing sentence, Mathes said: [...] "Reflection leads {{to the conclusion that the}} only worthwhile use for the life of a traitor, such as this defendant has proved to be, is to serve as an example to those of weak moral fiber who may hereafter be tempted to commit treason against the United States." ...|$|E

500|$|A Somali {{officer who}} had a {{previous}} relationship with the embassy, Major Siad, agreed to travel to rescue the German chargé d'affaires and British ambassador (junior staff from the British embassy had previously come to the US embassy). The Soviet Union was unable to land a plane in Mogadishu the previous day and the Soviet ambassador asked Ambassador Bishop if {{he and his staff}} could be rescued; Ambassador Bishop, a tennis partner of his Soviet counterpart, agreed but only <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> their own way to the embassy. [...] Seeing the helicopters on the morning of 5 January, they realized the Americans would not remain in the city much longer. At the request of Ambassador Bishop, Major Siad agreed to transport the Soviets, but only if he was paid enough; the US embassy paid Major Siad, who returned with the Soviet ambassador and 38 of his staff. The brother of President Barre, who was also a Major General and Chief of Police, showed up at the embassy in the afternoon with 25 members of his family requesting to be evacuated, but was turned away after a vocal conversation with the ambassador.|$|E
500|$|After the First World War, Crawford {{returned}} {{to live in}} England, and was demobilised from the New Zealand Army in April 1919. Looking for work, he wrote to Surrey offering to play for them <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> him some employment in turn, but the committee, while writing {{that they would be}} pleased if he played for the county again, could not [...] "see [...] way to find him employment". Crawford may have been contemplating playing professional cricket—unheard of for a former Public School cricketer—but instead found work at Repton, his old school. It is unclear what his position at Repton was at this time; he seems to have had no official cricketing role and it is possible he worked as a teacher simply to maintain his amateur status. In any case, Crawford only remained at Repton {{until the end of the}} academic year; his short stay may have been the result of poor results by the cricket team. However, Burns suggests: [...] "Another indication that the school was not entirely happy to be associated with the Surrey rebel, whose baggage also included an indifferent war record, was that when the Old Boys cricket team, the Repton Pilgrims, was formed in 1921, Crawford was alone among the school's former distinguished players not to be made a member. He was not invited to join the club until 1952." ...|$|E
500|$|Gardner was {{diagnosed}} with antisocial personality disorder. [...] In June 1985, Gardner pleaded guilty {{to the murder of}} Otterstrom and received a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. At one point, Gardner threatened to disrupt subsequent court hearings because he was upset over being required to wear a leg brace that would lock if he attempted to escape again. He was advised by guards that it would be to his benefit to behave in front of prospective jurors. District Judge Jay E. Banks instructed the jury, on October 22, 1985, that they had the option of a verdict for the lesser offense of manslaughter <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>found</b> Gardner to be under mental or emotional duress when he shot Burdell. The jurors deliberated less than three hours and found Gardner guilty of capital murder. Ultimately sentenced to death, Gardner selected execution by firing squad over lethal injection. Legislators in Utah had eliminated the firing squad as a method of execution in 2004, but convicts who were sentenced before that date, such as Gardner, could still select that option. Since 1976, only two other people have been executed by firing squad in the United States, both in Utah: Gary Gilmore and John Albert Taylor. In contrast to Taylor, who said he chose the firing squad to embarrass the state, Gardner's attorney said that his client did not want to attract attention and simply preferred to die this way.|$|E
