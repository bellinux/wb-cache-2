25|$|Following the Sino-Soviet {{split and}} the {{withdrawal}} of Soviet aid, the Wuhan-based No. 701 Institute began reverse-engineering the Type 01 in 1962. The result was the Type 065. It {{was based on the}} Riga hull with the <b>flush</b> <b>deck</b> replaced by a long forecastle. This modification was needed to accommodate a large medium-speed diesel powerplant; the civilian diesel was a substitute for the Rigas compact high-pressure steam turbine powerplant that the Chinese were unable to replicate. The first Type 065, 529 Haikou, was laid down at Huangpu in August 1964 and commissioned by August 1966.|$|E
25|$|The {{experience}} gained {{in designing the}} Project 17 Shivalik-class frigates will {{be applied to the}} Project 17A (P17A). The Project 17A frigates will improve upon the Project 17 (P17) in terms of stealth. They will have covered mooring deck and the number of antennae on the ship will be reduced by using a AESA radar. The P17A will also feature better roll stabilisation and a discreet visual profile. The weapon platform in the P17A ships will be compact and they will be armed with the Barak 8 (missile) surface-to-air missile developed jointly by India and Israel, and the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile. The weapon systems will be <b>flush</b> <b>deck</b> mounted allowing vertical launch of missiles from under the deck. The crew complement will be reduced from the existing 257 (including 35 officers) to about 150 by using high levels of automation, which will reduce the operational costs by around 20 per cent and result in higher operational availability of the warships. The construction times will be reduced and productivity will improved by using modular integrated construction. The ship will have a displacement of 6,670 tonnes.|$|E

50|$|The {{ship had}} a <b>flushed</b> <b>deck</b> design which enabled {{it to be}} fully closed down for nuclear, {{biological}} and chemical (NBC) warfare, with air conditioning and improved heating. Some armour (10 - 20 mm) was fitted around the bridge and gun mountings. There were, however, some problems with seakeeping, particularly with {{the shape of the}} bow which led to the forward part of the ship being very wet.|$|R

They had {{a beam of}} [...] and a draft of [...] They had a design {{displacement}} of [...] and they displaced up to [...] at full load, though their displacement was nominally within the 10,000-long-ton restriction set {{in place by the}} Washington Naval Treaty. Their hulls had a <b>flush</b> <b>deck</b> and a bulbous bow, the first time the latter feature was employed on an Italian warship. The ships were completed with a pair of tripod masts, though on trials they were found to vibrate excessively, and the foremast was strengthened with two extra legs. They had a crew of 723 officers and enlisted men, though during the war this increased to 781. They carried a pair of IMAM Ro.43 seaplanes for aerial reconnaissance; the hangar was located under the forecastle and a fixed catapult was mounted on the [...] at the bow.|$|E
500|$|While the {{preceding}} [...] of heavy cruisers {{were still being}} built, elements of the Italian naval command began to doubt {{the effectiveness of the}} new vessels, which sacrificed armor protection in favor of very high speeds.

The naval command agreed to allow the new ships to exceed the displacement limits, but instructed the designers to eliminate unnecessary features to save as much weight as possible. As a result, the belt armor was reduced in thickness and the planned torpedo tubes were removed. The <b>flush</b> <b>deck</b> of the Trentos was abandoned, with the ships instead incorporating a forecastle deck and a stepped-down main deck. In addition, the Zara design would be powered by just two propellers driven by lightweight machinery, unlike the four-shaft arrangement used in the Trentos.

25|$|Following the {{bankruptcy}} of its great rival, the Collins Line, the Cunard Line became the largest shipping company on the North Atlantic. In the late 1860s, Cunard management decided to order a trio of modern liners to hold their yet unchallenged title.

50|$|The hull was {{constructed}} of timber and {{was divided into}} fifteen watertight compartments. The lifeboat {{was also the first}} motor lifeboat to be built with <b>flush</b> <b>decks,</b> similar to earlier steam driven lifeboats. There was a semi enclosed deck shelter which housed the on deck helm position which helped to keep the crew out of bad weather launches. Below deck there was also a cabin which could accommodate up to twenty four people. If necessary the Barnett class lifeboat was capable of caring a total of 130 rescued people.|$|R
5000|$|Judged {{unsuitable}} for return to active sea service, Cameron was eventually refloated on 23 February 1941 and allocated {{for use as}} a hulk. United States Navy experts consequently subjected the ship to close scrutiny to derive damage control measures which could be applicable to ships of her type still in service with the Navy. As such, she presented them with what John Alden, in his book, <b>Flush</b> <b>Decks</b> and Four Pipes, termed the most extreme case of hull damage seen by Americans until [...] and [...] were blasted by Japanese bombs at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941.|$|R

2500|$|Aesthetically, {{her large}} tower forward, tall uncluttered stacks, and clean {{superstructure}} and hull were a sharp {{break from the}} elaborate bridgework, heavy tripod masts, and casemated secondary batteries of World War I-era battleships.

5000|$|These designs {{differed}} from the battleships being built in two significant ways beyond just their size. Firstly, unlike preceding classes, the [...] "maximum battleships" [...] were designed with a continuous <b>flush</b> main <b>deck.</b> Most battleships in this era had a long forecastle deck.

However, the casemates on the [...] "maximum battleships" [...] would have been higher above the waterline than they had been on earlier designs, so it is possible that their huge size and <b>flush</b> <b>decks</b> would have provided enough freeboard astern to keep the casemates dry.|$|R
50|$|The {{conversion}} {{was extremely}} simple, with a 107 m-long <b>flush</b> flight <b>deck</b> added. There was no hangar, the ship's eight Ki-76s being stored on deck. Defensive armament consisted of sixteen 25 mm anti-aircraft guns, with a depth charge projector forward.|$|R
5000|$|The gunwale side {{cut-outs}} normally {{seen on the}} Vosper, were built-up {{forward of}} the cabin, creating a <b>flush</b> forward <b>deck.</b> Normally, the Vosper required forward clearance {{in front of the}} Mk 7/8 tubes when torpedoes were fired over the gunwale.|$|R

6000|$|The {{appearance}} of the Leviathan herself was quite pleasing. Like all large, comfortable old whalers, she {{had a sort of}} motherly look:--broad in the beam, <b>flush</b> <b>decks,</b> and four chubby boats hanging at the breast.

2500|$|In side profile, turret deck ships resembled other {{merchant}} vessels with <b>flush</b> <b>decks</b> or {{with small}} forecastles and poop decks. In cross-section {{the differences between}} turret deck vessels and more conventional ships are apparent.

Further inboard, this [...] "deck" [...] arced to the vertical again by a reverse curve. That vertical plane then joined the weather deck atop the turret at a right angle. Structurally these elements were part of the hull, not of the superstructure, and the cargo holds of the ship extended up to the true weather deck atop the turret.|$|R
