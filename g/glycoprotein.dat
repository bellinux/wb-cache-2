40|$|Endoplasmic reticulum-associated {{degradation}} of newly synthesized <b>glycoproteins</b> {{has been demonstrated}} previously using various mammalian cell lines. Depending on the cell type, <b>glycoproteins</b> bearing Man 9 glycans and <b>glycoproteins</b> bearing Man 5 glycans can be efficiently degraded. A wide variety of variables can lead to defective synthesis of lipid-linked oligosaccharides and, therefore, in mammalian cells, species derived from Man 9 GlcNAc 2 or Man 5 GlcNAc 2 are often recovered on newly synthesized <b>glycoproteins.</b> The {{degradation of}} <b>glycoproteins</b> bearing these two species has not been studied. We used a Chinese hamster ovary cell line lacking Glc-P-Dol-dependent glucosyltransferase I to generate various proportions of Man 5 GlcNAc 2 and Man 9 GlcNAc 2 on newly synthesized <b>glycoproteins.</b> By studying {{the structure of the}} soluble oligomannosides produced by degradation of these <b>glycoproteins,</b> we demonstrated the presence of a higher proportion of soluble oligomannosides originating from truncated glycans, showing that <b>glycoproteins</b> bearing Man 5 GlcNAc 2 glycans are degraded preferentially...|$|R
40|$|<b>Glycoproteins</b> are an {{important}} class of biomolecules involved {{in a number of}} biological recognition processes. However, natural and recombinant <b>glycoproteins</b> are usually produced as mixtures of glycoforms that differ in the structures of the pendent glycans, which are difficult to separate in pure glycoforms. As a result, synthetic homogeneous glycopeptides and <b>glycoproteins</b> have become indispensable probes for detailed structural and functional studies. A number of elegant chemical and biological strategies have been developed for synthetic construction of tailor-made, full-size <b>glycoproteins</b> to address specific biological problems. In this review, we highlight recent advances in chemical and chemoenzymatic synthesis of homogeneous <b>glycoproteins.</b> Selected examples are given to demonstrate the applications of tailor-made, glycan-defined <b>glycoproteins</b> for deciphering glycosylation functions...|$|R
5|$|Among animals, {{there exists}} a single known example of an {{apparently}} freely-rotating structure, though it is used for digestion rather than propulsion: the crystalline style of certain bivalves and gastropods. The style consists of a transparent <b>glycoprotein</b> rod which is continuously formed in a cilia-lined sac and extends into the stomach. The cilia rotate the rod, so that it becomes wrapped in strands of mucus. As the rod slowly dissolves in the stomach, it releases digestive enzymes. Estimates {{of the speed of}} rotation of the style in vivo vary significantly, and it is unclear if the style is rotated continuously or intermittently.|$|E
5|$|This is, in turn, {{surrounded}} by the viral envelope, that is composed of the lipid bilayer taken from the membrane of a human cell when the newly formed virus particle buds from the cell. The viral envelope contains proteins from the host cell and relatively few copies of the HIV Envelope protein, which consists of a cap made of three molecules known as <b>glycoprotein</b> (gp) 120, and a stem consisting of three gp41 molecules which anchor the structure into the viral envelope. The Envelope protein, encoded by the HIV env gene, allows the virus to attach to target cells and fuse the viral envelope with the target cell membrane releasing the viral contents into the cell and initiating the infectious cycle.|$|E
25|$|When the {{endothelium}} is damaged, {{the normally}} isolated, underlying collagen {{is exposed to}} circulating platelets, which bind directly to collagen with collagen-specific <b>glycoprotein</b> Ia/IIa surface receptors. This adhesion is strengthened further by von Willebrand factor (vWF), which is released from the endothelium and from platelets; vWF forms additional links between the platelets' <b>glycoprotein</b> Ib/IX/V and the collagen fibrils. This localization of platelets to the extracellular matrix promotes collagen interaction with platelet <b>glycoprotein</b> VI. Binding of collagen to <b>glycoprotein</b> VI triggers a signaling cascade that results in activation of platelet integrins. Activated integrins mediate tight binding of platelets to the extracellular matrix. This process adheres platelets {{to the site of}} injury.|$|E

40|$|Identification of {{the cell}} surface <b>glycoproteins</b> is an {{essential}} requirement for elucidating the mechanisms that mediate intercellular adhesion and cell migration in gastrulating amphibian embryos. In our experiments the <b>glycoproteins</b> present at the surface of isolated cells at blastula and gastrula stages were labelled with H-labelled sodium borohydride. The procedure included the oxidation of either galactosyl and, or, N-acetylgalactosaminyl residues with galactose oxidase or sialic acid with sodium metaperiodate. The tritiated components were analysed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. On the surface of isolated embryonic cells, 23 <b>glycoproteins</b> have been identified. The most important observation was the labelling of IS new <b>glycoproteins</b> during gastrulation. At the late blastula stage, eight <b>glycoproteins</b> containing galactosyl or A'-acetylgalactosaminyl residues are labelled, while 23 are labelled at the late gastrula stage. In other experiments, <b>glycoproteins</b> labelled by [3 H]fucose or [3 H]mannose or precipitated by concanavalin A(ConA) -, or wheat-germ agglutinin (WGA) -Sepharose were studied by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis {{in order to provide}} supplementary data on the synthesis and lectin-binding properties of major cell surface <b>glycoproteins.</b> It appears that approximately 100 different <b>glycoproteins</b> are revealed by these methods. Among them, 13 have been identified as major cell surface <b>glycoproteins,</b> 12 being labelled by [3 H]mannose, four by [3 H]fucose, 10 bearing an affinity for ConA and five for WGA.

25|$|The thogotovirus <b>glycoprotein</b> is not {{similar to}} the {{influenza}} virus glycoproteins (haemagglutinin and neuraminidase), and instead shows some similarities with the gp64 <b>glycoprotein</b> of baculoviruses, which infect insects. It also has some similarity with the haemagglutinin of Quaranfil virus, the type species of a new genus of tick-transmitted orthomyxoviruses. The mechanism by which thogotoviruses gained a baculovirus-like <b>glycoprotein</b> is unknown. Pat Nuttall and colleagues have speculated that the acquisition enabled these viruses to infect ticks. This apparent receptor specificity for arthropod cells does not prevent most thogotoviruses from infecting vertebrates. The thogotovirus <b>glycoprotein</b> is classified as a class III or γ penetrene, lacking the fusion peptide present in influenza haemagglutinin (a class I or α penetrene).|$|E

Anti-A antibodies are hypothesized to originate from immune response towards influenza virus, whose epitopes are similar enough to the α-D-N-galactosamine on the A <b>glycoprotein</b> to be able to elicit a cross-reaction. Anti-B antibodies are hypothesized to originate from antibodies produced against Gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli, cross-reacting with the α-D-galactose on the B <b>glycoprotein.</b>|$|E
40|$|The Con A {{acceptor}} <b>glycoproteins</b> of murine {{and human}} tumour cell lines revealed by two-dimensional fingerprinting on polyacrylamide gels {{fall into two}} main categories: constant <b>glycoproteins</b> expressed by all cell lines and variable <b>glycoproteins</b> which are only expressed by particular tumour cell lines. Since the number of variable <b>glycoproteins</b> on a typical fingerprint is 50, fingerprints from different cell lines are readily distinguishable. However the variable <b>glycoproteins</b> are not expressed idiosyncratically and cell lines derived from similar classes of tumours express similar patterns of the variable <b>glycoproteins.</b> For example, murine fibrosarcomas express patterns which are virtually identical with one another. Characteristic patterns are also expressed by murine macrophage tumour lines, human carcinomas and human B lymphoblastoid cells. Thus, the variable <b>glycoproteins</b> behave {{as a set of}} linked markers which are indicators of the type of normal pre-neoplastic precursor cell from which a tumour is derived and appear to be a new type of marker for tumour cell classification.
