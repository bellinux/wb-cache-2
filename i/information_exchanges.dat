Both are weekly newspapers providing news via online {{as well and}} their headquarters {{are located in the}} neighborhood of Dongcheon-dong. The Gyeongju Sinmun was founded in 1989 and provides various news and critics on anything concerning Gyeongju. Its online newspaper, Digital Gyeongju Sinmun opened in December, 2000 to provide live local news out of the limit as a weekly newspaper and to establish mutual <b>information</b> <b>exchanges</b> from Gyeongju locals. In 2001, Gyeongju Sinmun started to present Gyeongju Citizen Awards to people who try to develop the local industry and economy, culture and education, and welfare service. Since 2003, the Wolseong Nuclear Power Plant headquarter co-hosts the awards with Gyeongju Sinmun.|$|E
25|$|Metrics {{applicable}} to the ED can be grouped into three main categories, volume, cycle time, and patient satisfaction. Volume metrics including arrivals per hour, percentage of ED beds occupied and age of patients are understood at a basic level at all hospitals as an indication for staffing requirements. Cycle time metrics are the mainstays of the evaluation and tracking of process efficiency and are less widespread since an active effort is needed to collect and analyze this data. Patient satisfaction metrics, already commonly collected by nursing groups, physician groups and hospitals, are useful in demonstrating the impact of changes in patient perception of care over time. Since patient satisfaction metrics are derivative and subjective, they are less useful in primary process improvement. Health <b>information</b> <b>exchanges</b> can reduce nonurgent ED visits by supplying current data about admissions, discharges, and transfers to health plans and accountable care organizations, allowing them to shift ED use to primary care settings.|$|E
2500|$|Their first attempt, in {{the spring}} of 1938, was rebuffed by the Navy. Air Chief Marshal Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt, {{commanding}} RAF Bomber Command, demanded Air Ministry action, and they wrote to George Pirie, the British air attach√© in Washington, suggesting he approach the Army with an offer of an information exchange with their own SABS. Pirie replied that he had already looked into this, and was told that the Army had no licensing rights to the device [...] as it was owned by the Navy. The matter was not helped by a minor diplomatic issue that flared up in July when a French air observer was found to be on board a crashed Douglas Aircraft Company bomber, forcing President Roosevelt to promise no further <b>information</b> <b>exchanges</b> with foreign powers.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the effects of {{operational}} and strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> on supply chain performance and the moderating role of information quality in relation to both operational and strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange.</b> The study was conducted using manufacturing companies located in the Northern region of Malaysia. Hierarchical multiple regressions were applied to test the hypotheses developed for the study. It was found that operational and strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> is significantly related to supply chain performance. The impact of strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> is greater as opposed to operational <b>information</b> <b>exchange.</b> <b>Information</b> quality does not moderate the relationship between both operational and strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> and supply chain performance. Nonetheless, this study provides evidence that both strategic <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> and operational <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> are required to enhance supply chain performance.

However, coordination {{is difficult because}} healthcare delivery processes are information intensive, complex and require interactions of hospitals with autonomous physicians working in multiple operational systems (i. e. multiple hospitals). We examine how three important variables distinctive of the healthcare operations context‚Äìuse of IT for dissemination of test results (ITDR) (i. e. Electronic Health Records systems) by {{physicians and}} hospital staff, social interaction ties among them, and physician employment‚Äìinfluence <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> and patient perceptions of their care. Drawing from the literature on process inter-dependencies and coordination, vertical integration and social exchange, we develop and test research hypotheses linking ITDR, social interaction ties and physician employment to <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> relationship, and <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> relationship to provider-patient communication. Using a paired sample of primary survey data and secondary archival data from CMS HCAHPS for 173 hospitals in the U. S. A., we find that increased <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> relationship drives provider-patient communication, and increased social interaction ties drives <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> relationship. Social interaction ties fully mediates the relationship between ITDR and <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> relationship. Physician employment amplifies the link between ITDR and social interaction ties, but {{does not have an}} effect on the link between ITDR and <b>information</b> <b>exchange.</b> We do not find a direct relationship between ITDR, and <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> relationship or provider-patient communication...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Recent {{internationalisation}} {{effort of}} the Swedish Armed Forces has led to rapidly increased demand on interoperability in general and <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> in particular. Flexibly composed units involve the building of never complete system. Nevertheless, the challenge of connecting systems turns {{out not to be}} only a matter of technical issues but also semantic (unique interpretation of information) and organisational (<b>information</b> <b>exchanged</b> is efficiently used) ones. In order to provide a domain specific model within a particular context we need an adaptive methodology that deals with how to build an <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> model based upon <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> requirements. By having a uniquely defined method to build the <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> models we can provide a timely and resource efficient <b>information</b> <b>exchange.</b> This paper presents a methodology that is a first step towards meeting the challenges mentioned above...|$|R

40|$|Title: <b>Information</b> <b>exchange</b> with {{professionals}} in dementia decision-making: views of informal caregivers Background: Worldwide, {{there are an}} estimated 24 million people with dementia. The majority lives at home and are largely dependent of informal caregivers. Informal caregivers are increasingly involved in care decisions for persons with dementia. Barriers to make such decisions include lack of <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> and support. This creates unnecessary stress in informal caregivers. Shared decision-making, when facilitated by professionals, can support adequate <b>information</b> <b>exchange,</b> enabling informal caregivers to make care decisions. Aim and research question: In order to gain insight into the role of {{professionals in}} <b>information</b> <b>exchange,</b> informal caregivers‚Äô views on professionals regarding <b>exchanging</b> <b>information</b> in care decisions should be examined. This insight might result in indications for adequate <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> between informal caregivers and professionals. Method: This qualitative study was conducted using the principles of the Grounded Theory approach. The study population consisted of informal caregivers of persons with dementia from the Netherlands who were part of a dementia care network. The software Atlas. ti was used. Results: Informal caregivers‚Äô views on professionals regarding <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> in decision-making are depended on the nature of involvement. Professionals were considered to be either actively or passively involved. Informal caregivers were positive about <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> of actively involved professionals. The <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> of passively involved professionals was too often not consistent with their needs. Conclusion: The <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> of professionals was too often not appropriate. Many decisions were discussed by informal caregivers with members of the care network, but these decisions were not indisputably based on shared decision-making. Decisions were mainly based on good sense and gut feeling. Recommendations: Improvement of expertise for professionals regarding dementia and support during the process of <b>information</b> <b>exchange</b> in decision-making, to ensure informal caregivers are equal partners in decision-making...|$|R
