5000|$|Vater is {{primarily}} {{known for his}} work in anatomy, but he also published works in the fields of chemistry, botany, pharmacology and gynaecology. He was the first to describe the <b>hepatopancreatic</b> <b>ampulla,</b> which is the juncture of the pancreatic duct and the common bile duct, and is now referred to as the ampulla of Vater.In 1719, Vater was the first to notice oval-shaped organs of concentric layers of connective tissue wrapped around nerve endings in the skin. They were between 1-4 mm long, and he called the structures papillae nervae. Apparently his research was forgotten, because in 1831 they were rediscovered by anatomist Filippo Pacini (1812-1883) when performing a dissection of a hand. Pacini was the first to describe their functionality as mechanoreceptors that are sensitive to vibration and pressure changes, and thus the structures were to become known as Pacinian corpuscles. Today, the term [...] "Vater-Pacini corpuscles" [...] is sometimes used to credit the discoveries of both men. These organs are one of several types of mechanoreceptors in the body, some others being Meissner corpuscles (tactile and touch receptors), Ruffini corpuscles (respond to skin stretch and torque), and Krause corpuscles.|$|E
40|$|A 71 -year-old {{woman was}} {{referred}} to our department complaining of painless progressive jaundice for the last 3 mo. Magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed the ectopic <b>hepatopancreatic</b> <b>ampulla</b> draining into the fourth part of the duodenum adjacent to the duodenojejunal flexure; the irregular morphology of the duodenojejunal flexure likely due to a soft tissue mass. Laparotomy confirmed {{the presence of the}} abnormal ampulla of Vater located at the fourth part of the duodenum and a soft tissue tumor about 6 cm × 5 cm × 5 cm with a peduncle adjoining the ampulla. Resection of the tumor, including some peripheral tissue, and a Roux-Y loop anastomosis choledochojejunostomy were performed. Pathological examination indicated an intestinal villous adenoma accompanied by severe dysplasia and focal canceration. Periampullary carcinoma with ectopic ending of the Vater’s ampulla into the fourth part of the duodenum is rather rare. The embryonic genetic background of this anomaly has not yet been fully explained. It is worth mentioning that MRCP is useful for demonstrating anomalies and anatomic variants of the biliary tract system and pancreatic duct...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Pancreas divisum is a {{congenital}} anatomical anomaly {{characterized by}} the lack of fusion of the ventral and dorsal parts of the pancreas during the eighth week of fetal development. This condition is found in 5 % to 14 % of the general population. In pancreas divisum, the increased incidence of acute and chronic pancreatitis is caused by inadequate drainage of secretions from the body, tail and part of the pancreatic head through an orifice that is too small. The incidence of diverticula {{in the second part of}} the duodenum is found in approximately 20 % of the population. Compression of the duodenal diverticula at the end of the common bile duct leads to the formation of biliary lithiasis (a principal cause of acute pancreatitis), pain associated with biliary lithiasis owing to compression of the common bile duct (at times with jaundice), and compression of the last part of Wirsung's duct or the <b>hepatopancreatic</b> <b>ampulla</b> (ampulla of Vater) that may lead to both acute and chronic pancreatitis. Case presentation We describe the radiological findings of the case of a 75 -year-old man with recurrent acute pancreatitis due to a combination of pancreas divisum and duodenal diverticula. Conclusion Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography is advisable in patients with recurrent pancreatitis (both acute and chronic) since it is the most appropriate noninvasive treatment for the study of the pancreatic system (and the eventual presence of pancreas divisum) and the biliary systems (eventual presence of biliary microlithiasis). Moreover, it can lead to the diagnostic suspicion of duodenal diverticula, which can be confirmed through duodenography with X-ray or computed tomography scan with a radio-opaque contrast agent administered orally. </p...|$|E
40|$|OBJETIVO: Estudar a morfologia do sistema biliar extra-hepático e do trígono cistohepático (triângulo de Calot) analisando a sua disposição, variações ou malformações MÉTODOS: foram investigados 50 cadáveres adultos. RESULTADOS: em 47 casos (94 %) a junção hepato-cística se dava próxima ao hilo hepático. Em 3 casos (6 %), a junção entre esses ductos se dava distalmente, ao nível da ampola hepato-pancreática (ampola de Vater). O ângulo formado pela junção hepato-cística foi menor que 30 º em 72, 3 % dos casos; em 23, 4 %, ficou entre 30 e 45 º; em 2, 1 % variou entre 45 e 60 º e em 2, 1 % foi maior do que 60 º. A junção hepato-cística se fez, na maior parte dos casos, pela direita (59, 6 %), seguida pela {{anterior}} (17 %), posterior (12, 8 %) e esquerda (10, 6 %). Em relação aos componentes do trígono cistohepático, a artéria cística esteve presente em 56 % dos casos; a veia porta em 36 %; a artéria hepática direita em 34 %; a artéria hepática esquerda em 2 % e a artéria hepática própria em 2 % dos casos. O comprimento e o diâmetro do ducto cístico foi 2, 53 ± 1, 19 cm e 0, 29 ± 0, 12 cm, respectivamente. A prega espiral do ducto cístico (válvula de Heister) foi observada em 80 % dos casos. O infundíbulo da vesícula biliar (bolsa de Hartmann) esteve presente em 74 % dos casos. Esses conhecimentos são importantes, principalmente para os cirurgiões que atuam nesta região, através de videolaparoscopia. CONCLUSÃO: No trígono cistohepático a artéria cística foi encontrada com mais freqüência. OBJECTIVE: {{study the}} morphology of the extrahepatic biliary system and cystichepatic triangle (Calot’s triangle) analysing the disposition, variations and malformations. METHODS: 50 adult cadavers were studied. RESULTS: in 47 cases (94 %), the cysticohepatic junction ocurred near the hepatic hilum. In 3 cases (6 %), the junction between cystic duct and common hepatic duct ocurred {{at the level}} of the <b>hepatopancreatic</b> <b>ampulla</b> (Vater's ampulla). The angle formed by the junction of the cystic duct with the common hepatic duct was less than 30 º in 72, 4 % of the cases. In 23, 0 %, this angle was between 30 and 45 º. In 21, 3 % was between 45 and 60 º. In 2, 3 % of the cases it was greater than 60 º. The common hepatic duct recieved the cystic duct on its right side in the majority of the cases (59, 6 %); anteriorly in 17 % of the cases; posteriorly in 12, 8 % and on the left side in 10, 6 % of the cases. In relation to the cystichepatic triangle components the cystic artery was present in 56 % of the cases; the portal vein in 36 %; the right hepatic artery in 34 %; the left hepatic artery in 2 % and the proper hepatic artery in 2 % of the cases. The dimensions of the cystic duct were 2, 53 ± 1, 19 cm of length and 0, 29 ± 0, 12 cm of diameter. The spiral fold (Heister's valve) was observed in 80 % of the cases. The infundibulum of the gallbladder (Hartmann's pouch) was present in 74 % of the cases. This knowledge contribute to the practice of video-assisted laparoscopy in this region. CONCLUSION: in cystichepatic triangle the cystic artery was found most frequently...|$|E
