40|$|A reverse {{transcription}} and {{polymerase chain reaction}} method was developed and used to detect fecal excretion of <b>enterotropic</b> mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). A nested set of primers for polymerase chain reaction was located in the polymerase region of the MHV genome. The assay was used to follow {{the time course of}} <b>enterotropic</b> MHV excretion in mice after oronasal inoculation with the virus. The assay detected MHV genome excretion in all mice beginning on day 3 through day 21 after inoculation. No MHV genome was detected in inoculated mice on or after day 27 following inoculation. This time course of detection of excreted virus corresponded to the period of infectivity of this isolate in a previous study. These results indicate that {{reverse transcription}} and polymerase chain reaction are useful for <b>enterotropic</b> MHV detection in specimens that are easily and noninvasively obtained and are clinically relevant.

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} {{of a field}} strain, {{a vaccine}} strain a d the egg-adapted Van Roekel strain of avian encephalo-myelitis virus in susceptible chicken embryos and day-old chickens was investigated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays {{for the detection of}} virus-specific antibody and antigen. The Van Roekel strain was shown to be highly neurotropic whereas the field and vaccine strains were <b>enterotropic.</b> Radioimmuno-precipitation studies using Na 125 I-labelled purified virus failed to detect any differences in the composition of the structural viral proteins of each strain that could account for these differences. As expected, the field and vaccine strains were more efficient than the Van Roekel strain at inducing antibody following oral adminis-tration. Primary cultures of chicken embryo brain cells supported the growth of the Van Roekel strain to a much greater extent than the field and vaccine strains...|$|E
40|$|A {{monoclonal}} antibody solution hybridization (MASH) assay {{was developed to}} detect fecal excretion of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). The assay used a biotinylated cDNA probe to detect viral RNA target sequences by hybridization in solution, capture of hybrids on the solid phase with antibiotin antibody, and immunoassay with an enzyme-labelled {{monoclonal antibody}} specific for DNA-RNA hybrids. The MASH assay was used to monitor {{the time course of}} <b>enterotropic</b> MHV excretion after oronasal inoculation. Infectivity of the inoculated mice was simultaneously monitored with sentinel animals. The MASH assay detected MHV excretion in all inoculated mice, with the highest mean excretion levels occurring from day 3 through day 9 postinoculation. Mean excretion then decreased gradually to below detection limits by day 21 postinoculation. Sentinels became infected on exposure to inoculated mice up to but not after day 21 postinoculation. Infected sentinel mice showed a time course of virus excretion similar to that of inoculated mice. These results indicate that the MASH assay is useful for rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of MHV in clinical specimens from laboratory mice...|$|E
40|$|A newly {{recognized}} parvovirus {{of laboratory}} rats, designated rat parvovirus type 1 a (RPV- 1 a), {{was found to}} be antigenically distinct. It was cloned, sequenced, and compared with the University of Massachusetts strain of rat virus (RV-UMass) and other autonomous parvoviruses. RPV- 1 a VP 1 identity with these viruses never exceeded 69 %, thus explaining its antigenic divergence. In addition, RPV- 1 a had reduced amino acid identity in NS coding regions (82 %), reflecting phylogenetic divergence from other rodent parvoviruses. RPV- 1 a infection in rats had a predilection for endothelium and lymphoid tissues as previously reported for RV. Infectious RPV- 1 a was isolated 3 weeks after inoculation of infant rats, suggesting that it, like RV, may result in persistent infection. In contrast to RV, RPV- 1 a was <b>enterotropic,</b> a characteristic previously associated with parvovirus infections of mice rather than rats. RPV- 1 a also differed from RV in that infection was nonpathogenic for infant rats under conditions where RV infection causes high morbidity and mortality. Thus, RPV- 1 a is the prototype virus of an antigenically, genetically, and biologically distinct rodent parvovirus serogroup...|$|E
40|$|The genome and {{transcriptional}} {{pattern of}} a newly identified respiratory variant of transmissible gastroenteritis virus were analyzed and {{compared with those of}} classical <b>enterotropic</b> transmissible gastroenteritis virus. The transcriptional patterns of the two viruses indicated that differences occurred in RNAs 1 and 2 (S) and that RNA 3 was absent in the porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) variant. The smaller RNA 2 (S) of PRCV was due to a 681 -nucleotide (nt) deletion after base 62 of the PRCV peplomer or spike (S) gene. The PRCV S gene still retained information for the 16 -amino-acid signal peptide and the first 6 amino acid residues at the N terminus of the mature S protein, but the adjacent 227 residues were deleted. Two additional deletions (3 and 5 nt) were detected in the PRCV genome downstream of the S gene. The 3 -nt deletion occurred in a noncoding region; however, the 5 -nt deletion shortened the potential open reading frame A polypeptide from 72 to 53 amino acid residues. Significantly, a C-to-T substitution was detected in the last base position of the transcription recognition sequence upstream of open reading frame A, which rendered RNA 3 nondetectable in PRCV-infected cell cultures...|$|E
40|$|Selected {{strains of}} the human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) types 1 and 2 are able to infect human colon epithelial cells in vitro, suggesting a mechanism for the anal route of HIV transmission. In some cases, HIV is not produced by infected colon cells but can be rescued after coculture with T-lymphoid cells. One of the HIV strains (HIV 1 -NDK) replicated well in colonic cells. A transmission electron microscope study demonstrated two major structural perturbations in producer colon cells: an unusual number of secretion bodies {{and the appearance of}} intracellular lumina with disorganized microvilli, indicating a defect in brush border assembly and differentiation. Either abnormality could account for HIV-induced enteropathy consisting of chronic diarrhea and malabsorption in the absence of enteric pathogens. Moreover, HT 29 cells infected with HIV provide a unique model for selection of <b>enterotropic</b> HIV strains. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea and malab-sorption, are frequently associated with AIDS (11, 12). However, the immediate cause of these symptoms is un-clear, and rigorous studies have often failed to identify causative microbial pathogens (22). Therefore, the impair-ment of intestinal function in AIDS patients has been attrib...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCoronaviruses {{recently}} {{emerged as}} major human pathogens causing outbreaks of {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} and Middle-East respiratory syndrome. They utilize the spike (S) glycoprotein {{anchored in the}} viral envelope to mediate host attachment and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes to initiate infection. The S protein is a major determinant of the zoonotic potential of coronaviruses and is also the main target of the host humoral immune response. We report here the 3. 5 Å resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the S glycoprotein trimer from the pathogenic porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), which belongs to the recently identified delta genus. Structural and glycoproteomics data indicate that the glycans of PDCoV S are topologically conserved when compared with the human respiratory coronavirus HCoV-NL 63 S, resulting in similar surface areas being shielded from neutralizing antibodies and implying that both viruses are under comparable immune pressure in their respective hosts. The structure further reveals a shortened S 2 ' activation loop, containing a reduced number of basic amino acids, which participates to rendering the spike largely protease-resistant. This property distinguishes PDCoV S from recently characterized betacoronavirus S proteins and suggests that the S protein of <b>enterotropic</b> PDCoV has evolved to tolerate the protease-rich environment of the small intestine and to fine-tune its fusion activation to avoid premature triggering and reduction of infectivity. IMPORTANCE. Coronaviruses use transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein trimers to promote host attachment and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. We determined a near-atomic resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the S ectodomain trimer from the pathogenic porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), which is responsible for diarrhea in piglets and has had devastating consequences for the swine industry worldwide. Structural and glycoproteomics data reveal that PDCoV S is decorated with 78 N-linked glycans obstructing the protein surface to limit accessibility to neutralizing antibodies in a way reminiscent of what has recently been described for a human respiratory coronavirus. PDCoV S is largely protease-resistant which distinguishes it from most other characterized coronavirus S glycoproteins and suggests that enteric coronaviruses have evolved to fine-tune fusion activation in the protease-rich environment of the small intestine of infected hosts...|$|E
40|$|Nucleobindins are a {{class of}} secreted, {{multi-domain}} Ca 2 + binding proteins that interact with nucleic acids. Two nucleobindins, nucleobindin- 1 (NUCB 1) and nucleobindin- 2 (NUCB 2) have been identified so far. In 2006, nesfatin- 1, an 82 amino acid peptide encoded in NUCB 2 was discovered. Nesfatin- 1 is an anorexigenic and insulinotropic peptide found abundantly in hypothalamus, pancreas and stomach. Meal responsive insulin secretion is regulated by glucagon like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1), glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), peptide YY (PYY) and cholecystokinin (CCK) secreted by intestinal mucosal cells. Since both nesfatin- 1 and intestinal hormones modulate insulin secretion, nesfatin- 1 could regulate intestinal hormones to elicit its insulinotropic action. Nucleobindin- 1 primarily regulates Ca 2 + homeostasis. Like NUCB 2, NUCB 1 is also present in the pancreas, stomach, intestine and pituitary. NUCB 2 has a high similarity (62 % in humans) to NUCB 1. Both proteins also retain their prohormone convertase cleavage sites. However, no information exists on whether NUCB 1 encodes bioactive peptides. The fact that NUCB 1 is a secreted protein suggests an endocrine function for NUCB 1 and/or its encoded peptide. This research hypothesizes that nesfatin- 1 is <b>enterotropic,</b> and NUCB 1 encodes an insulinotropic nesfatin- 1 -like peptide (NLP). Nesfatin- 1 protein expression was found in STC- 1 cells and it co-localized GLP- 1, GIP, CCK and PYY in mouse enteroendocrine cells. Treatment of STC- 1 cells with nesfatin- 1 stimulated GLP- 1, GIP, CCK mRNA expression and protein secretion, while opposite effects were found for PYY. In silico analysis of the NUCB 1 amino acid sequence found a 77 amino acid NLP. Mouse pancreatic islets and MIN 6 cells express NUCB 1 mRNA and protein. NUCB 1 was co-localized with insulin in mouse pancreatic islets. While treatment of cells with synthetic NLP increased preproinsulin mRNA expression and secretion, a scrambled peptide based on NLP was ineffective, indicating that the specific amino acid sequence is crucial for its insulinotropic action. Overall, the data presented supports the hypotheses. The studies reaffirm NUCB 2 expression in intestine and provide {{the first set of}} evidence for nesfatin- 1 regulation of enteric hormones. It also found a novel NUCB 1 encoded insulinotropic NLP that could elicit other functions of nesfatin- 1...|$|E
40|$|Viruses exploit {{molecules}} on {{the target}} membrane as receptors for attachment and entry into host cells. Thus, receptor expression patterns can define viral tissue tropism and might to some extent predict the susceptibility of a host to a particular virus. Previously, others and we have shown that respiratory pathogens of the genus Gammacoronavirus, including chicken infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), require specific alpha 2, 3 -linked sialylated glycans for attachment and entry. Here, we studied determinants of binding of <b>enterotropic</b> avian gammacoronaviruses, including turkey coronavirus (TCoV), guineafowl coronavirus (GfCoV), and quail coronavirus (QCoV), which are evolutionarily distant from respiratory avian coronaviruses based on the viral attachment protein spike (S 1). We profiled the binding of recombinantly expressed S 1 proteins of TCoV, GfCoV, and QCoV to tissues of their respective hosts. Protein histochemistry showed that the tissue binding specificity of S 1 proteins of turkey, quail, and guineafowl CoVs was limited to intestinal tissues of each particular host, {{in accordance with the}} reported pathogenicity of these viruses in vivo. Glycan array analyses revealed that, in contrast to the S 1 protein of IBV, S 1 proteins of enteric gammacoronaviruses recognize a unique set of nonsialylated type 2 poly-N-acetyl-lactosamines. Lectin histochemistry as well as tissue binding patterns of TCoV S 1 further indicated that these complex N-glycans are prominently expressed on the intestinal tract of various avian species. In conclusion, our data demonstrate not only that enteric gammacoronaviruses recognize a novel glycan receptor but also that enterotropism may be correlated with the high specificity of spike proteins for such glycans expressed in the intestines of the avian host. IMPORTANCE: Avian coronaviruses are economically important viruses for the poultry industry. While infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a respiratory pathogen of chickens, is rather well known, other viruses of the genus Gammacoronavirus, including those causing enteric disease, are hardly studied. In turkey, guineafowl, and quail, coronaviruses have been reported to be the major causative agent of enteric diseases. Specifically, turkey coronavirus outbreaks have been reported in North America, Europe, and Australia for several decades. Recently, a gammacoronavirus was isolated from guineafowl with fulminating disease. To date, it is not clear why these avian coronaviruses are enteropathogenic, whereas other closely related avian coronaviruses like IBV cause respiratory disease. A comprehensive understanding of the tropism and pathogenicity of these viruses explained by their receptor specificity and receptor expression on tissues was therefore needed. Here, we identify a novel glycan receptor for enteric avian coronaviruses, which will further support the development of vaccines...|$|E
40|$|Viruses can infect a {{wide range}} of hosts; varying from {{bacteria}} and plants to animals and humans. While many viral infections may pass unnoticed, some are of major importance due to their implications on health and welfare of plants, animals and/or humans. In particular, viruses that can infect avian hosts have been studied intensively due the occurrence of the pandemics of highly pathogenic influenza A virus infection or “bird flu’’. Viral infections in domesticated birds can result in huge economic losses in the poultry industry. In wild birds, infections may be asymptomatic, but these viruses may remain in these birds and thus they may act as reservoirs. Particularly wild birds may be ideal reservoirs because of their ability fly over long distance and hence they can effectively spread viruses along the migration routes. Coronaviruses in birds are considered economically important pathogens worldwide. They are classified in the genus Gammacoronaviridae, family Coronaviridae. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the prototype of this group and can cause severe respiratory disease in chickens. In addition, coronaviruses have been reported to induce respiratory disease in other avian species, including pheasants, pigeons and peafowls. Interestingly, apart from infecting the respiratory system IBV is capable of replicating in other organ systems within a specific host, indicating that IBV has an extended virus tropism. On the other hand, some other gammacoronaviruses, for an example turkey, guineafowl and quail coronaviruses have been observed to possess a more restricted tropism by limiting the infection to the gastrointestinal system. Viral and host factors that enable the attachment of a virus to the target host cell are crucial in defining viral tropism. This thesis was aimed to identify these factors for avian coronaviruses in view of understanding the mechanism behind viral tropism. To this end several novel methods were established to study {{the first step in the}} avian coronavirus infection cycle. While Chapter 1 gives a introduction to the aims of this thesis chapter 2 provides an overview on the function of the gammacoronavirus spike proteins and its role in defining the tropism and susceptibility. In addition it summarizes the reported data on tissue interactions of the coronaviral spike. Chapter 3 describes the use of recombinant spike proteins as a tool to understand the tropism of gammacoronaviruses using infectious bronchitis virus, the prototype of the group, as an example. The novel avian tissues microarray and its benefits in view of defining organ and susceptibility to a particular coronavirus are demonstrated in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 reveals a novel receptor for <b>enterotropic</b> gammacoronaviruses and receptor specificity towards defining their restricted enterotropism. While differences in the tissue interactions of mutated influenza virus attachment proteins, HAs, have been shown in Chapter 6 the detailed protocol of evaluating tissue interactions with protein histochemistry is described in Chapter 7. Overall we provide evidence for viral and host determinants that mediate avian coronavirus tropism. In the final discussion (Chapter 8) remaining gaps in defining the tropism and pathogenicity of avian coronaviruses will be discussed...|$|E
