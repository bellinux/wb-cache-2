5|$|Beyond is the Mediterranean Sea and {{the island}} of Cyprus. Here, a {{transition}} in hue is made, from the browns that prevail in {{the lower half of}} the painting to the aquas that saturate the upper half. The Nile River meanders <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>distance,</b> emptying its seven arms into the Mediterranean at the Nile Delta. South of Cyprus is the Sinai Peninsula, which forms a land bridge between Africa and Southwest Asia. The Red Sea lies beyond, eventually merging – as the mountain ranges to its left and right do – with the curved horizon.|$|E
5|$|Journeys {{story is}} told wordlessly through {{gameplay}} and using cutscenes. The player's character begins on a sand dune in a seemingly endless desert. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>distance</b> looms a large, foreboding mountain with a glowing crevice that splits its peak. As the character approaches the mountain, they find remnants of a once-thriving civilization, eroded by sand over time. Scattered throughout the ruins {{at the end of}} each area are stones at which the traveler rests; these stones give the traveler the vision of meeting a larger, white-robed figure in a circular room, with art on the walls describing the rise and fall of the civilization mirroring the player's journey. The player must also contend with the ancient automatons left over from a war which ended the civilization, and which still roam the city looking for intruders.|$|E
5|$|The first {{generation}} of Early Netherlandish painters did not usually {{pay much attention to}} landscape backgrounds. They were often included, showing strong influence from the Italian painters, but typically as minor elements of the composition, seen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>distance</b> and lacking any real observation of nature. This diptych, however, contains {{one of the most memorable}} landscape backgrounds in Northern 15th-century art. The panoramic view of Jerusalem extends upwards in the distance to the mountainous peaked range in the background. The sky, which continues to the upper part of the right hand panel, is rendered in deep blues and lined with cumulus clouds. These clouds are similar to those in the Ghent Altarpiece and, as in that work, are included to give depth to and enliven the background skyscape. The sky seems to have just darkened, in keeping with the idea that the panel captures the moment of Jesus' death. Faint cirrus clouds can be seen in the far high-ground, with the presence of the sun is suggested by a shadow falling on the top left area of the panel.|$|E

5|$|Rodrigues {{is taken}} to Nagasaki, where he is imprisoned with many Japanese converts. At a tribunal, he is told Catholic {{doctrine}} is anathema to Japan. Rodrigues demands to see governor Inoue Masashige, who he learns, to his dismay, is the old man seated before him {{in charge of the}} proceedings. Rodrigues is returned to prison, and Kichijiro soon arrives to be imprisoned as well. He explains to Rodrigues that court officials threatened him in order that he betray Rodrigues. Kichijiro then says he is a Christian and asks to be absolved of his betrayal through a confession, which Rodrigues reluctantly grants him. He later is released after being told to step on a fumi-e (a crudely carved crucifix), an act symbolizing rejection of the faith. Later, Rodrigues is brought under guard to the shoreline to await someone. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>distance,</b> he witnesses an emaciated Garupe and three other prisoners approaching on the shoreline under separate guard. Still in the distance, the three other prisoners are taken offshore on a small boat and are about to be drowned from the boat one-by-one as an inducement to get Garupe to renounce his faith. Rodrigues is restrained by guards on shore as he watches Garupe refuse to apostatize. He then sees the desperate Garupe drowned next to the other three prisoners when he attempts to swim offshore trying to rescue the last prisoner from being drowned.|$|E

500|$|... "Siempre Tú" [...] was {{composed}} by Muñiz in Los Angeles {{along with its}} producers Nico Stadi and Mike Green. It was recorded {{in the same city}} at the Pulse Music Group Studios. The idea of the song came to Muñiz after he started to say phrases [...] "like when you think about your girlfriend" [...] accompanied by a piano and an electric guitar. In an interview, the singer stated, [...] "I feel that it is a very Californian song [...] because it is a more proactive and current pop, and the fact that Alexandra Stan recorded a part of the song moved me a lot". On another occasion, he added, [...] "We wanted to do a song with which you can tell a person that you miss her, that you are always thinking about her and longing to be with her. This was the idea of the track". Stan and Muñiz were linked by producer Gabriel Huiban, who previously worked with the latter. [...] "Siempre Tú" [...] was released worldwide on 21 April 2017 through Warner Music Mexico. The accompanying cover artwork shows Muñiz sitting on a chair looking off <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>distance</b> against a backdrop of a street with tall buildings.|$|E

John introduces Andrew and James to Christ on the riverbank, the same two apostles who are in Herod's courtyard, where they visited the Baptist during his imprisonment.|$|E
2500|$|Scott Wilkinson of AVS was {{similarly}} {{impressed by the}} visual effects (though he did not enjoy the movie itself): [...] "Even sitting too far away, the movie itself looked gorgeous—sharp as a tack with beautiful colors. The smallest details, such as Jaden Smith's character <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>distance,</b> somehow looked clearer than I would have expected under normal circumstances; I got the distinct impression that the image could have been blown up by quite a bit and no detail would have been lost. The CGI animals did look a bit artificial, but that didn't bother me very much at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{battlefield}} {{use of the}} mitrailleuse as artillery was a fatally flawed concept. To {{avoid being}} hit by Dreyse rifle fire, the mitrailleuse batteries were systematically deployed beyond about 1,400m (1,500 yards) from the Prussian lines. [...] Although the maximum range of the mitrailleuses was 3,400m (3,700 yards), the distances at which they were typically engaged rarely exceeded 2,000m (2100 yards) which was less than the reach of French field artillery. However accurate fire at 1500 yards was always extremely difficult to achieve with the typical open sights present on the mitrailleuse. For instance, mitrailleuse bullet impacts on the ground could not be observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>far</b> <b>distance</b> unless enemy ranks had been disrupted by hits from them. It may be noted that modern machine guns are typically used at ranges far shorter than their maximum range—the M60 machine gun, for instance, is normally used at an effective range of 1,100m (1,200 yards), compared to its maximum range of 3,725m (4,074 yards). The mitrailleuse, by contrast, was often used at the outer edges of its range and {{without the benefit of}} optical range finding equipment. These deficiencies in the operational usage of the Reffye mitrailleuse proved disastrous in the Franco-Prussian War.|$|E
