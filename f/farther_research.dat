40|$|AbstractThe {{application}} of bi-metal lining pipes {{is more and}} more extensive because of low cost and resistance to corrosion. The inner diameter of bi-metal lining pipe decreases 1 mm∼ 8 mm as compared to carbon steel pipe. It's necessary to reevaluate the transporting capacity and friction loss of bi-metal pipes. The flow frictional characteristics and transporting capacity of bi-metal lining pipe whose outer diameter ranged from φ 114 mm to φ 324 mm were studied. Studies showed that the inner surface roughness affected transporting capacity much more than the flow cross section in condition of the same pipe size. Wall thickness of lining pipe had little effects on the transporting capacity when it was less than 4 mm. The friction of bi-metal lining pipe was less than carbon steel pipe. Therefore, the transporting capacity of bi-metal lining pipe was higher than carbon steel pipe by 23 %- 46 % in condition of the same pipe size and pressure drop, and the transporting distance was much <b>farther.</b> <b>Research</b> results in the paper provide reliable guidance for designing bi-metal lining gas pipelines...|$|E

If sufficient amelioration does not occur, adding psychotropic comedication may result in a favorable outcome. To establish sex differences in psychotropic comedication use, we conducted an exploratory retrospective study among first-break patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder. Concerning patient characteristics, no difference in age or antipsychotic drug use was established. At admission, men significantly more often had comorbid substance abuse. Analysis showed that significantly more women than men received benzodiazepines after the onset of psychosis (OR 1. 92, 95 % CI 1. 13 - 1. 27). No sex difference was found in antidepressant comedication (OR 1. 22, 95 % CI 0. 48 - 3. 11). We established a definite sex difference in concomitant benzodiazepine use in first-break patients with schizophrenia.

40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} of a {{theoretical}} character and aimed at presenting various descriptions of the interactions between all possible pairs of four well-known negotiating styles dependent on personality traits. Methodology: This study was based on analysis of the interactions as well as authors’ experiences from their observations and analyses on human behaviors during numerous negotiations and roleplay exercises arranged at the courses for practitioners. The stress was put on analyzing the interactions occurring between people representing both different and the same negotiating styles. Findings: The attempt at describing such interactions was successful and promising for <b>farther</b> <b>research.</b> The concept constitutes {{a useful tool for}} analyzing human behavioral aspects of different types of business negotiations, within the process of their planning, conduct and evaluation. Nevertheless, the concept will be a subject of subsequent authors’ research, focusing on its improvement mainly by searching more precise features of negotiating styles and interactions between them. Practical implications: The concept can be applied to analyze many real negotiation situations as well as within the experiment to be arranged by the authors to examine those interactions within the hundreds of pairs of negotiators solving particular case studies. Thus the description of such interactions can be treated as a specifc hypothesis. Originality: In general, the suggestion for solving complex, diffcult and essential issues of negotiating styles was presented but was rarely investigated in the literature on negotiations. In particular, an original concept of describing the interactions between those styles was suggested,...|$|E

S. thoroughly has been blocked, are so-called border-doses markedly reduced. 2) The temperature of the sensitised animal reacts far more sensitive upon the paraenteral foreign protein injection than that of the non-sensitised as Friedberger-Mita stated. Thereby is the anaphylactic-index promoted, when man blocks the functions of the R. E.

Thereby, the praecipitin- and the komplement-titre in serum in general parallely reduce in the stadium of fever-rising, and when they have diminished to a marked degree, does the fever neither continue nor newly arise.

The main goal was checking whether the visible radiation of thearc provides information which might prove to be useful in monitoring of the welding process, similarly as thesignals recorded in the electric circuit of the welding arc. Design/methodology/approach: The experimental station was designed and build. A spectrophotometer, in thevisible spectral range of 340 nm to 860 nm, was used. The investigations were conducted on the automated GTAwelding station. For each welding parameter the arc light spectrum was measuredFindings: Research results presented in this paper indicate that the welding arc radiation contains a number ofinformation concerning the course of the welding process. That signal is much more sensitive to the changes ofwelding conditions and should be used as a tool for monitoring of the TIG welding processResearch limitations/implications: The fiber spectrophotometer in the visible spectral range of 340 nm to 860 nm is an expensive instrument and that fore it can be used only as a complementary tool in monitoring ofwelding processes.

40|$|The {{literary}} {{method of}} "Socialist realism" was introduced into China {{almost at the}} same time when it was advanced in Russia at the beginning of 1930 's. Zhou yang introduced it to China for the first time by "About Socialist realism and Revolutionary romanticism" in 1933. He accepted it, however, passively contrary to our expectation. It is remarkable that he received it as the method of literature after the Socialism system was settled. This phenomenon continued until post-Emancipation. The word of Socialist realism was nor used in the treatise by Mao ze dong in 1942, "Wen yi jiang hua" (Lecture of Art and Literature). Socialiat realism was not advocated until the second whole China assembly of literators delegation. Zhou yang who reported at the assembly placed the method of Socialist realism on the highest criterion. Later after 1956, however, methods free from Socialist realism called "bai hua qi fang, bai jia zheng ming" were claimed. Liu bin yan, Wang meng and Qin zhao yang began to propose questions to the method of Socialist realism through their works and reviews. The typical one is "Realism-Broad road" written by Qin zhao yang in June of 1956. Against such a movement the great writers belonging to main current began to counter attack referring to the political issued named the conflict of Anti-Right from 1956 to 1958. The themes disputed there are extended to the many fields; for example, "Stereotype", "Individuality and Universality", "Method of writing and Ideology of art", "Political criterion", "Estimation of Balzac" and so on. The dispute in this time may be regarded as the expansion of the dispute in 1930 's. in the view of Marxism literary theory. Qu qiu bai, one of the representative theorists in 1930 's. left many criticisms, in which his stresses were laid on the ideological problems, such as Classness of literature, Conceptions of the world and standpoint of writers, or on the concrete problems, such as use of old patterns, creation of the popular language, popularization and improvement. The height of Socialist realism ended in 1958 reached more concrete contents of literaty theory in comparison with Qu qiu bai's, for example, in 1930 's. It must be investigated properly in the grobal view point. After the later half of 1958 the advocacy of combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism resulted in the disappearance of the slogan called Socialist realism.

40|$|Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a {{technology}} that {{has been around for}} three decades now. It is being used in various scenarios in technologically modern societies around the world and becoming a crucial part of our daily life. But we often forget how the inner technology is designed to work, or even if it is as trustable and secure as we think. While the RFID technology and protocols involved with it has been designed with an acceptable level of security in mind, not all implementations and use cases are as secure as consumers believe. A majority of implementations and products that are deployed suffer from known and critical security issues.      This thesis work starts with an introduction to RFID standards and how the technology works. Followed by that a taxonomy of known attacks and threats affecting RFID is presented, which avoids going through too much of technical details but provides references for <b>farther</b> <b>research</b> and study for every part and attack. Then RFID security threats are reviewed from risk management point of view, linking introduced attacks to the security principle they affect. We also review (lack thereof) security standards and guidelines that can help mitigating introduced threats. Finally to demonstrate how practical and serious these threats are, three real-world case studies are presented, in which we break security of widely used RFID implementations. At the end we also review and highlight domains in RFID security that can be researched farther, and what materials we are currently missing, {{that can be used to}} raise awareness and increase security of RFID technology for consumers.      The goal of this thesis report is to familiarize readers with all of the publicly documented and known security issues of RFID technology, so that they can get a sense about the security state of their systems. Without getting involved with too much technical details about every attack vector, or going throw tens of different books and papers, readers can use this report as a comprehensive reference to educate themselves about all known attacks against RFID, published to the date of writing this report. ...|$|E
40|$|This Thesis {{presents}} {{discussion and}} empirical evidence arguing that role (both occupational and social) {{is a crucial}} concept {{in the analysis of}} attitude formation and change and the person's behaviour. Earlier chapters involve discussion of roles, attitudes and attitude change and in later chapters evidence is presented showing that role-specific attitudes can be demonstrated empirically. The topic area for these investigations and discussions was that of energy conservation. Chapter 1 discusses what is meant by role and how role is related to information and attitudes. It includes a consideration of attitude change. The second chapter reviews research work carried out within the broad area of 'social responsibility', which includes energy conservation. The first two studies presented are exploratory studies of energy use and conservation in universities. The first is a straightforward analysis of energy consumption at Surrey University, revealing a number of interesting use-cycles and demonstrating that people's behaviour can significantly affect energy use. The second, 'Energy Conservation in British Universities' is a survey {{of the ways in which}} British Universities were attempting at the time to reduce their energy consumption and costs. It was felt that such a survey could provide valuable information not only as a purely descriptive analysis of patterns of energy conservation adopted in universities, but also in terms of assumptions made about attitudes and the behaviour of university personnel with regard to energy use, and more particularly about the possibilities of influencing such attitudes and behaviours in a favourable directions, i. e. towards greater energy conservation. An analysis of responses allowed universities to be arranged along a dimension from those taking most energy conservation action to those taking least. This dimension was found to conform to a cumulative scale (Guttman scale). By taking the further step of treating the cumulative scale as a flow diagram, it was possible to demonstrate that position on it was possibly linked to movement through a series of designated procedures. Three other studies were carried out. The general methodology for these drew heavily on information obtained from the first two studies. The first of these studies is described in Chapter 4, The Effects of Energy Conservation Publicity'. Information/publicity was published in a large institution (Surrey University) which was intended to boost energy conservation awareness and behaviour by university personnel. The effects of this information were analysed from 1118 respondents in short interview situations. The effects of the information were clearly apparent upon the awareness of respondents about energy conservation matters, and a process of decay over time was found (measured by an Awareness Index). Few occupational differences were found. Chapter 5 describes a more comprehensive questionnaire study intended to examine the relationships between attitudes, beliefs and knowledge of energy conservation, and to look for any occupational or social role effects. Once again significant sex differences emerged, though the strong relationship between sex and occupation was also apparent in this study. Significant differences were also found between 'experienced' subjects (those who had been interviewed for the Publicity Study) and 'naive' subjects (those who had not) in terms of their response rates (motivation to respond) as well as their degree of expressed concern, indicating the importance of previous information on attitudes. The last Study, presented in Chapter 6, was a more direct test of the effects of role upon the evaluation of other role groups by subjects, and of the concept of 'centrality of beliefs'. The hypotheses presented were supported fully or partially by the results, Clear occupational differences emerged with respect to 'occupational stereotypy', defined as occupationally specific ways of evaluating occupational groups, including one's own. The final chapter draws together the findings from these studies and discusses them in the light of the role/attitude model and attitude change. Relevant recent research from the literature is discussed and <b>farther</b> <b>research</b> proposed. The applicant concludes that a role-based model of attitudes, beliefs and behaviour, rooted in a cognitive model of Man, can provide useful generalisations drawn from work in the areas of attitudes towards energy conservation and applied to general relation-ships between attitude and behaviour.
