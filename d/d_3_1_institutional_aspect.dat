Then segments MA, MB and MC are sides of a triangle. Let us consider analogous problem for the metric space (X, d) with at least four points. Let A, B, C ∈ X be three fixed points. Then, for the point M ∈ X we suppose that a triangle can be formed from the distances d 1 = d(M, A), d 2 = d(M, B) and <b>d</b> <b>3</b> = d(M, C) iff the following conjunction of inequalities is true: (1. 1) d 1 + d 2 − <b>d</b> <b>3</b> ≥ 0 and d 2 + <b>d</b> <b>3</b> − <b>d</b> <b>1</b> ≥ 0 and <b>d</b> <b>3</b> + <b>d</b> <b>1</b> − d 2 ≥ 0.

This leads to a deficiency in vesicle transport and storage, which affects neurotransmitter vesicle turnover and release in the central nervous system. Since the genomic sequence of the Ap <b>3</b> <b>d</b> <b>1</b> gene of mocha mouse is not known, precise mapping of the deletion as well as reliable genotyping protocols are lacking. Findings We sequenced the Ap <b>3</b> <b>d</b> <b>1</b> gene (HGNC GeneID: 8943) around the deletion site in the mocha mouse and revealed a 10639 bp deletion covering exon 2 to 6. Subsequently, new PCR primers were designed yielding a reliable genotyping protocol of both newborn and adult tissue. To examine the genotypes further, hippocampal neurons were cultured from mocha and control mice. Patch-clamp recordings showed that mocha neurons had a higher input resistance, and that autaptic EPSC in mocha cultures depressed faster and stronger as compared with control cultures. Conclusion Our study reports the sequence of the deleted part of the Ap <b>3</b> <b>d</b> <b>1</b> gene in mocha mice, {{as well as a}} reliable PCR-based genotyping protocol. We cultured hippocampal neurons from control and mocha mice, and found a difference in input resistance of the neurons, and in the synaptic short-term plasticity of glutamatergic autapses showing a larger synaptic depression than controls. The described procedures may be useful for the future utilization of the mocha mouse as a model of defective vesicle biogenesis. Importantly, as genotyping by eye color is complicated in newborn mice, the designed protocol is so fast and reliable that newborn mice could rapidly be genotyped and hippocampal neurons dissociated and cultured, which is normally best done at P 0 -P 2. </p...|$|R

A spectroscopic criterion - where the r. m. s. deviation between theory and experiment is minimalized - was applied to rare gases Ne I through Rn I, and to the isoelectronic sequence Ne I to V XIV. Once relativistic corrections are introduced, as well as configuration mixing, r. m. s. ƊE are smaller than 500 cm- 1, for computed spectra of c. a. 100, 000 cm- 1. As for the isoelectronic sequence, {{we were able to}} interchange names ascribed to levels 2 p 5 <b>3</b> <b>d</b> <b>1</b> P 1 and 2 p 5 <b>3</b> <b>d</b> <b>3</b> D <b>1.</b> A variational criterion - minimalization of ground state first order energy - yields results very near those of Hartree-Fock, and is useful {{as a starting point for}} perturbation studies...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{compare the}} two {{techniques}} of pre-chop and non-pre-chop, and discuss the technical advantages of the capsulorhexis forceps assisted pre-chop. METHODS: Totally 149 cases of age-related cataract were randomly divided into using pre-chop(Group A) and non-pre-chop(Group B) techniques groups, for Group A patients received phacoemulsification after pre-chop by using capsulorhexis forceps. The ultrasonic energy, average phacoemulsification time, intraoperative complications, 1 d, 1 wk uncorrected visual acuity(UCVA) and <b>1</b> <b>d,</b> <b>3</b> <b>d,</b> <b>1</b> wk postoperative corneal edema were recorded and compared. RESULTS: The subgroups of {{the same group of}} nuclei were compared in the two groups. The ultrasonic time in Group A was lower than that of Group B, and the difference was significant(P P P CONCLUSION: Compared with non-pre-chop, the time of ultrasound in pre-chop group was shorter, the degree of corneal edema was lighter and early postoperative UCVA was better...|$|R
40|$|The {{character}} of the ground and optically excited states was investigated by quantum chemical calculations. We propose a rung ground state with V <b>3</b> <b>d</b> <b>1</b> xy-O 2 p <b>1</b> y-V <b>3</b> <b>d</b> <b>1</b> xy character, instead of the conventional picture of one unpaired electron shared by 2 V ions. The unpaired electron on O is low-spin coupled to the V d electrons and spin density is predicted to be localized on vanadium. The absorption peak at 0. 9 eV is assigned to a state with similar orbital occupations but a different spin coupling scheme, resulting in spin density localized on the bridging oxygen. ...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To study an {{approach}} to visual acuity correction after intracapsular cataract extraction by phase-II intraocular lens implantation through the individualized arcuate keratotomy. METHODS: For demonstration, 48 postoperative patients(50 eyes) receiving the intracapsular cataract extraction were gathered up. Each patient received a scleral tunnel major incision along the radial line of the maximum corneal refractive power determined by a cornea curvimeter, and a arcuate keratotomy was made opposite to the major one; through the major incision an iris-claw intraocular lens is implanted. Each patient was measured for their corneal astigmatism and uncorrected visual acuity {{before and after the}} surgery. RESULTS: The results suggested the average corneal astigmatism before the surgery and that <b>3</b> <b>d,</b> <b>1,</b> <b>3,</b> 6 and 12 mo after the surgery as + 3. 18 ± 0. 68, - 1. 56 ± 0. 73, + 0. 87 ± 0. 51, + 1. 21 ± 0. 70, + 1. 33 ± 0. 68 and + 1. 48 ± 0. 48 respectively. The uncorrected visual acuities <b>3</b> <b>d,</b> <b>1,</b> <b>3,</b> 6 and 12 mo after the surgery are 0. 5 ± 0. 38, 0. 56 ± 0. 23, 0. 55 ± 0. 24, 0. 52 ± 0. 28 and 0. 51 ± 0. 25 respectively. CONCLUSION: Phase-II intraocular lens implantation witharcuate keratotomy is helpful to improve the postoperative visual acuity and reduce preoperative corneal astigmatism after the intracapsular cataract extraction aphakic eyes, It is also a low-cost surgery, and easy to perform, with minor surgical injuries, particularly available for surgical visual acuity correction of the aphakic eye receiving intracapsular cataract extraction...|$|R
