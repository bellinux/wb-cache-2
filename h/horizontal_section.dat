25|$|At St John's {{the design}} is even more complex, because, {{near the top of}} the upper window, the tower itself {{suddenly}} appears to become octagonal in <b>horizontal</b> <b>section,</b> before the spire is reached. The change to the section is masked by the presence of four large pinnacles which rise from the corners at this point, as if they were sitting on the buttresses but are in line with the tower itself. Behind the pinnacles, once again Blacket has placed an encircling battlement which appears to mark the point where the tower ceases to be tower and becomes spire, or vice versa. Harmonious with the four crocketed pinnacles, and on the same level, are little dormer windows.|$|E
25|$|Like George Stephenson, Ericsson {{understood}} {{that a large}} area was needed to extract heat from the hot gases. This he did in a long horizontal tube filled with water which ran under {{the full length of}} the engine. It {{can be seen in the}} illustration on top of this page, sticking out to the right, with the vertical chimney attached to it. Within the <b>horizontal</b> <b>section</b> was a tube carrying the hot gases, this formed an ‘S’ shape so the gases made three passes through the water. This ‘S’ shaped tube was also tapered causing the gases to speed up as they cooled down. In practice this tube is almost impossible to clean.|$|E

500|$|Below the {{superstructure}} of the vimana are temple [...] "eaves" [...] projecting half a meter {{from the}} wall. Below the eaves two different decorative schemes may be found, {{depending on whether}} a temple {{was built in the}} early or the later period of the empire. In the early temples built prior to the 13th century, there is one eave and below this are decorative miniature towers. A panel of Hindu deities and their attendants are below these towers, followed by a set of five different mouldings forming the base of the wall. In the later temples there is a second eave running about a metre below the upper eaves with decorative miniature towers placed between them. The wall images of gods are below the lower eaves, followed by six different mouldings of equal size. This is broadly termed [...] "horizontal treatment". The six mouldings at the base are divided in two sections. Going from the very base of the wall, the first horizontal layer contains a procession of elephants, above which are horsemen and then a band of foliage. The second <b>horizontal</b> <b>section</b> has depictions of the Hindu epics and Puranic scenes executed with detail.

The upper eaves projects about half a meter from the wall. There is a second eaves running about a meter below the upper eaves with decorative miniature towers (aedicule) between them. The wall images of Hindu gods and goddesses and their attendants are below the lower eaves, and there are 120 such sculptured panels in all. Below these are six moldings of equal size with decorations in frieze. This according to historian Kamath is broadly called [...] "horizontal treatment". The six moldings {{at the base of}} the wall is divided into two sections. Starting from the base where the wall meets the jagati, the first horizontal lmolding contains procession of elephants, above which are a horsemen, and a band of foliage on the third.

On the <b>horizontal</b> <b>section</b> the {{aperture}} will expand internally, a somewhat {{larger number of}} rays being thus reflected from the jambs; and {{the aperture}} being thus the smallest possible outside, this is the favorite military form of inlet window, always found in magnificent development in the thick walls of mediæval castles and convents. Its effect is tranquil, but cheerless and dungeon-like in its fullest development, owing to the limitation {{of the range of}} sight in the outlook, which, if the window be unapproachable, reduces it to a mere point of light. A modified condition of it, with some combination of the outlook form, is probably the best for domestic buildings in general (which, however, in modern architecture, are unhappily so thin walled, that the outline of the jambs becomes a matter almost of indifference), it being generally noticeable that the depth of recess which I have observed to be essential to nobility of external effect has also a certain dignity of expression, as appearing to be intended rather to admit light to persons quietly occupied in their homes, than to stimulate or favor the curiosity of idleness.|$|E
60|$|Description.--The {{capitulum}} is {{not much}} compressed, a <b>horizontal</b> <b>section</b> giving an oval figure; it is placed obliquely on the peduncle, the scuta descending lower than the terga and carina. There are eight valves, of which the scuta, terga, and carina are large; the rostrum {{and a pair of}} latera are very small and often rudimentary. These three latter valves are essentially distinguished from the scales of the peduncle, the upper ones of which they sometimes hardly exceed in size, by not being moulted at each period of exuviation. The latera overlie the carinal half of the terga; I presume that they are homologous with the carinal latera in Scalpellum. Each successive layer of shell forming the valves is thick, and extends over nearly the whole inner surface; hence the carina and terga, and to a certain extent the scuta, either actually do project freely much beyond the sack, or would have done so, had not their upper ends been removed; for the upper and old layers of shell, in most of the species, either scale off or disintegrate and wear away. A rectangularly projecting rim, serrated by small teeth, is formed at the bottom of each fresh layer of growth, along the external surfaces of each valve (see upper part of fig. 1 b´ Pl. VIII.) This structure, {{as well as that of}} the crenated scales on the peduncle, is important, for by this means the animal, as we shall presently see, forms and enlarges the cavity in the rock or shell in which it is imbedded.|$|E

6000|$|This is the {{microscopic}} structure {{of an ordinary}} piece of coal. But if a great series of coals, from different localities and seams, or even {{from different parts of}} the same seam, be examined, this structure will be found to vary in two directions. In the anthracitic, or stone-coals, which burn like coke, the yellow matter diminishes, and the ground substance becomes more predominant, and blacker, and more opaque, until it becomes impossible to grind a section thin enough to be translucent; while, on the other hand, in such as the [...] "Better-Bed" [...] coal of the neighbourhood of Bradford, which burns with much flame, the coal is of a far lighter colour, and transparent sections are very easily obtained. In the browner parts of this coal, sharp eyes will readily detect multitudes of curious little coin-shaped bodies, of a yellowish brown colour, embedded in the dark brown ground substance. On the average, these little brown bodies may have a diameter of about one-twentieth of an inch. They lie with their flat surfaces nearly parallel with the two smooth faces of the block in which they are contained; and, on one side of each, there may be discerned a figure, consisting of three straight linear marks, which radiate from the centre of the disk, but do not quite reach its circumference. In the <b>horizontal</b> <b>section</b> these disks are often converted into more or less complete rings; while in the vertical sections they appear like thick hoops, the sides of which have been pressed together. The disks are, therefore, flattened bags; and favourable sections show that the three-rayed marking is the expression of three clefts, which penetrate one wall of the bag.|$|E
