40|$|This study {{examined}} the often contrived advertising claims of the manufacturers of variable resistance isotonic machinery. Specifically, the study sought to ascertain whether certain equipment was compatible with musculo-skeletal and perceptual needs and limitations of the human user: that is, to determine whether presently installed <b>eccentric</b> <b>cams,</b> which provide the variable resistance, matched the users force curves. The format {{of this research was}} in the ergonomic tradition in which empirical research is not necessarily the primary avenue. Consequently the inter-disciplinary nature of ergonomics required small-scale laboratory- simulation experiments to be conducted in a diverse range of disciplines such as physiology, psychology and biomechanics. It was found that on all five pieces of variable resistance machinery analysed, a mismatch between the force curves and the <b>eccentric</b> <b>cams</b> exist. The cams were redesigned accordingly. The metabolic cost of performing fixed-rate isoinertial lifts was moderate. The psychophysical analysis revealed that perceptual responses indicated that the work was classified as 'light' and only at 30 % stress levels do local cues begin to dominate. Based on these findings it was concluded that manufacturers advertising claims in the instances analyzed were not well-founded and that variable resistance isotonic machinery should only be used to develop muscular strength and endurance, and do not effectively serve as weight-loss devices. iii...|$|R
40|$|An arrow-launching device ("hand ballista") {{has been}} {{developed}} using the principles of a compound bow, but relying on modern energy storage technologies in place of bending li,mbs. It is designed to use either bands of latex rubber that stretch to store energy and contract to release it, or alternatively a highpressure, high-speed gas spring that stores energy when compressed. Each version uses a system of wheels and <b>eccentric</b> <b>cams</b> to transfer force from the user pulling back on the string to the rubber or the gas spring, providing the appropriate mechanical advantage. Substituting these technologies for limbs makes the hand ballista more compact, sturdier, and potentially more energy efficient than most modern bows. The prototype functions as desired when using a heavy arrow (300 grams) but materials and time limitations resulted in undesirably massive pulleys, causing poor efficiency and poor durability when using light arrows. Several possible improvements are suggested...|$|R

50|$|Two {{solutions}} {{to this problem}} appeared {{in the early spring}} powered clocks in the 15th century: the stackfreed and the fusee. The stackfreed was an <b>eccentric</b> <b>cam</b> mounted on the mainspring arbor, with a spring-loaded roller that pressed against it. The cam was shaped so that early in the running period when the mainspring was pushing strongly, the stackfreed would provide an opposing force, while later when the mainspring was almost run down and pushing weakly, it would provide a helping force. The stackfreed added a lot of friction and probably reduced a clock's running time substantially; it was rarely used and was abandoned after about a century.|$|E
50|$|A {{rocker arm}} and {{two types of}} links open the intake-valves by {{transferring}} the rotational movement of a drive shaft with an <b>eccentric</b> <b>cam</b> to the output cam.The movement of the output cam is varied by rotating the control shaft with a DC stepper motor and changing the fulcrums of the links. This makes the continuous adjustment {{of the amount of}} the valve's lift (e.g., the amount of intake opening), during the intake valve event in the four-stroke cycle, possible.CVTC and VVEL together control the valve phases and its valve events, allowing free-control of the valve timing and lift. This results in more efficient airflow to the cylinder, significantly improved responsiveness, optimizing the balance between power and environmental performance.|$|E

A new common frame/suspension design {{was introduced in the}} latest generation Sixty Special which was also used in other GM full size cars. While the other GM divisions used a front-steer setup (steering linkage in front of the engine crossmember), all Cadillac RWDs retained the 1961-vintage front suspension (rear steering linkage, <b>eccentric</b> <b>cams</b> in the steering knuckle in lieu of shims, strut rods attached to the framerails for caster adjustment). Rear suspensions were now driven by the Pontiac-designed -inch ring-gear 10-bolt Salisbury live axle. A new trailer towing package was added allowing larger trailer loads to be pulled. Coupled with heavy duty cooling, 3.23 gearing, high output 80 amp large frame alternator and heavy-duty THM400 transmission, the long wheelbase was ideal to pull trailers weighing up to 7,000 lb (3,200 kg).|$|R

40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Most {{improvements}} and re-designs of compound bows apparently use or partly apply empirical methods to determine bow performance characteristics. A kineto-elastic analysis procedure of a compound bow which in {{each side of}} the limbs has two stacked <b>eccentric</b> <b>cams</b> connected by two inextensible cables and one inextensible string is presented in this thesis. With the principle of finite element method, a large deformation cantilever beam model was created by combining small deflections of segmented cantilever beam elements to determine the trajectories of limbs, end points where the cams are installed. A quasi-static model was constructed to simulate the draw process. The displacements of cams, cables and string were analyzed and the required draw force as a function of draw length was obtained by gradually drawing the bow string. A commercial finite element analysis software was employed to verify the precision of the elastic limb model. The other arbitrary cam system was simulated by the revised kineto-elastic model. Three cases of optimal cam profile designs were studied by this integral model. Several design variables were discussed in the optimization to accomplish three different objectives, which are interesting to archers. The modeling, simulation and optimization procedure used for combining elastic components, flexible but inextensible string-cable components, and rigid component in a precision dynamic model of a mechanical system can also be applied to archery bows with more complex configuration, and to other similar mechanical systems...|$|R
50|$|The {{reciprocating}} action may be produced several ways. A crank or Scotch yoke type drive may be used, {{a swash plate}} type drive, a captive cam or eccentric, barrel cam, or other rotary to linear drive. Modern tools are built with variants {{of all of these}} mechanisms. <b>Eccentric</b> <b>cam,</b> crank and scotch yoke drives need balance weights to reduce vibration in the plane of the rotating element, and may still exhibit vibration that is objectionable to a user of a handheld saw and can lead to difficulty in controlling a cut. The swash plate drive has the advantage that there is little rotational out of balance, so the principal vibration is in line with the blade. This is generally controllable by keeping the foot of a handheld tool against the work.|$|E
50|$|A cam and {{follower}} {{is formed}} by the direct contact of two specially shaped links. The driving link is called the cam (also see cam shaft) and the link that is driven through the direct contact of their surfaces is called the follower. The shape of the contacting surfaces of the {{cam and follower}} determines {{the movement of the}} mechanism. In general a cam follower mechanism's energy is transferred from cam to follower. The cam shaft is rotated and, according to the cam profile, the follower moves up and down. Now slightly different types of <b>eccentric</b> <b>cam</b> followers are also available in which energy is transferred from the follower to the cam. The main benefit of this type of cam follower mechanism is that the follower moves a little bit and helps to rotate the cam 6 times more circumference length with 70% force.|$|E
50|$|See drawing, right. The stackfreed {{consists}} of a stiff spring arm (A) with a roller at the end (B) which presses against an <b>eccentric</b> <b>cam</b> (D), usually the roller rides in a groove in the cam's edge. The cam is shaped like a snail. It has a gear on it (E) that is turned by a gear on the mainspring arbor (C), so it makes one turn during the clock's running period. The force of the spring arm against the cam exerts a retarding force on the mainspring, reducing its torque, which varies with {{the thickness of the}} cam. When the mainspring is fully wound up, the arm presses against the wide part of the cam. Since it is far from the axis, the retarding force it exerts is maximum. As the clock runs and the mainspring unwinds, the cam rotates and the spring bears against the narrower parts of the cam, reducing the retarding force gradually, to compensate for the declining force of the mainspring. At the end of the running period there was often a steep depression in the cam that the roller pressed against, so the force of the stackfreed spring aided the weakened mainspring.|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{verifications}} of cam-follower contacts {{are very}} important because of the difficulties for a reliable simulation due to the continuous variation of load, speed and geometry of the lubricated contact. Some experiments {{have been carried out}} with a new apparatus, specifically designed and realised for investigation on cam-follower and gear teeth contacts, in order to test its capability to measure film thickness and contact forces. Circular <b>eccentric</b> <b>cams</b> have been used because they feature lower transient effects and comparison of the results with the theoretical/numerical ones is easier. The tests have been performed using cams with two different eccentricities and surface roughness, and two different followers, one made of steel and one made of glass. The behaviour of the cam-follower contacts at several different rotational speeds, ranging from 50 to 500  rpm, and different pre-loads have been investigated. Lubrication regimes ranged from boundary to complete, being most of the tests performed under mixed lubrication conditions. Localised wear has occurred during some tests.

5000|$|In {{the most}} common configuration, there is a cam or wheel {{at the end of}} each limb. The shape of the cam may vary {{somewhat}} between different bow designs. There are several different concepts of using the cams to store energy in the limbs, and these all fall under a category called bow eccentrics. The four most common types of bow <b>eccentrics</b> are Single <b>Cam,</b> Hybrid Cam, Dual Cam and Binary Cam. However, there are also other less common designs, like the Quad Cam and Hinged. Cams are often described using their [...] "let-off" [...] rating. As a cam is rotated, the force required to hold the bow in position reaches a peak and then decreases as the bow approaches maximum extension (a position known as [...] "the wall"). The percent-difference between the maximum force encountered during the draw and the force required to hold the bow in full extension is the [...] "let-off". This value is commonly between 65% and 80% of the peak weight for recently designed compound bows, although some older compound bows provided a let-off of only 50% and some recent designs achieve let-offs in excess of 90%.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Various {{aspects of}} the {{improvement}} of the functioning of grinding accuracy are considered. Active methods of the control of grinding systems are proposed to ensure the quality required for finishing. It is pointed out that the quality of finishing is closely connected with the mutual position of the tool and the work piece in the grinding process. This position is appreciated by permissible state areas of the axis of the tool and the work piece. Analytical expression of this interaction is described by non-traditional mathematical model’s dependences. Mathematical models presented evaluate eccentricity between the tool and the work piece or between other elements of the system and enable one to better understand the appearance of the second and higher harmonics on the work piece processed or on the tool. They allow one to simulate the finishing not only of the cylindrical, but also of non-round profile work pieces, such as <b>cams,</b> <b>eccentrics,</b> etc. The mathematical dependences worked out allow one to build various modifications of the grinding systems and to evaluate the quality of their functioning.

40|$|Different {{types of}} {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT) {{have been developed for}} vehicle and wind turbine applications, which can generate constant-frequency current without using power converters. An infinitely variable speed converter (IVSC) is a type of CVT that can achieve a zero speed ratio and transmit a large torque at low speed ratios. An IVSC with drivers that convert an <b>eccentric</b> motion of <b>cams</b> to a concentric motion of the output shaft through one-way bearings is introduced, and an active control system with a combined feedback and feed forward control that can automatically control the speed ratio of the transmission is developed.
