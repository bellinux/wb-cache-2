5|$|There {{were nine}} {{issues in the}} first sequence, in one volume of six numbers and a second volume of three numbers. All issues in the first run were in pulp format and were priced at 15 cents. The first four issues were 128 pages; the next five were 112 pages. The title was Marvel Science Stories for five issues, then Marvel Tales for two issues, and then Marvel Stories {{for the last two}} issues of the first run. The {{publisher}} for the first series was listed as Postal Publications of Chicago for the first four issues, and as Western Publishing of New York and Chicago; in both cases the owner was Martin and Abraham Goodman. The intended schedule was bimonthly but this was never achieved. The editor was Robert O. Erisman. The second incarnation of the magazine lasted for six issues on a more regular quarterly schedule, starting in November 1950. The price was 25 cents and the page count was 128 pages for all six issues; the first two issues and last <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> sequence were in pulp format, and the three from May 1951 to November 1951 were in digest format. The title returned to Marvel Science Stories for the first three issues of this series, and changed to Marvel Science Fiction for the last three issues. The publisher was listed as Stadium Publishing of New York; as with the first series, Martin and Abraham Goodman were the owners.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} merger, Bernhard decided to retire, and {{approached}} Edward Ferman, {{the editor of}} Fantasy and Science Fiction, and Joel Davis, at Ziff-Davis, among others, about a possible sale of Amazing. Jonathan Post, of Emerald City Publishing, believed he had concluded a deal with Bernhard, and began to advertise for submissions, but the negotiations failed. Bernhard also approached George H. Scithers, who declined, but put Bernhard in touch with Gary Gygax of TSR. On 27 May 1982 TSR, Inc. acquired the trademarks and copyrights of Amazing Stories. Scithers was taken on by TSR as editor beginning with the November 1982 issue. He was replaced by Patrick Lucien Price in September 1986, and then by Kim Mohan in May 1991. TSR ceased publication of Amazing with the Winter 1995 issue, but in 1997, shortly after they were acquired by Wizards of the Coast, the magazine was relaunched, again with Mohan as editor. This version lasted for only ten issues, though it did include a special celebratory 600th issue in early 2000. The science fiction trade journal Locus commented in an early review that distribution of the magazine seemed to be weak. The title proved unable to survive: the last <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> version was dated Summer 2000. The title was then acquired by Paizo Publishing, who launched a new monthly version in September 2004. The February 2005 issue was the last printed; a March 2005 issue was released in PDF format, and in March 2006 Paizo {{announced that it would}} no longer publish Amazing. In September 2011, the trademark for Amazing Stories was acquired by Steve Davidson, and online publication began in 2012 with two issues in July and August.|$|E

25|$|The final <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> second volume, {{which was}} {{published}} January 21, 2009, saw {{the conclusion of the}} Moloch storyline that began with that volume, and God accepting Liandra back into heaven. The series was relaunched with a new storyline in July 2009, and guest starred the character Illyria from Joss Whedon's Buffyverse.|$|E
25|$|Hungarian nationalists demanded {{education}} in the Magyar language, a position that united Catholics and Protestants opposed to instruction in Latin as desired by Catholic bishops. In the Hungarian Diet of 1832–36, the conflict between Catholic laymen and clergy sharpened considerably, and a mixed commission was established. It offered the Protestants certain limited concessions. The basic <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> religious and educational struggle was how to promote Magyar language and Magyar nationalism and achieve more independence from German Austria.|$|E

25|$|The {{new tools}} and {{matrices}} arrived from London, so the issuing of the Maple Leaf coinage ceased as a result. The obverse of the coins is inscribed GEORGIVS VI DEI GRATIA REX (George VI by the Grace of God, King). During the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> coinage, a commemorate silver $1 was struck in 1949 to commemorate Newfoundland becoming the tenth province of Canada. The 1948 coins are very scarce, especially the 50¢ {{and the silver}} $1. This {{is due to the}} slow delivery of the modified tools and matrices from London.|$|E
25|$|Sliders {{was also}} spun {{off into a}} comic book series {{published}} by Acclaim Comics. This comics series had no direct input from series creators Tracy Tormé and Robert K. Weiss, but Tracy Tormé did pass along several notes detailing stories that went unproduced. Series star Jerry O'Connell also personally authored one special <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> comic series. While advertised and solicited for advance order, the final Sliders comic, titled Get a Life, {{never made it to}} store shelves; but artist Rags Morales completed art for 14 pages of the comic before production was stopped.|$|E
25|$|Printing of the $1,000 note ceased in 2000. The {{denomination}} {{was withdrawn}} {{on the advice}} of the Solicitor General and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), as it was often used for money laundering and organized crime. The Bank of Canada has requested that financial institutions return $1,000 notes for destruction. The most recent <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> denomination was in 1992 as part of the Birds of Canada series.

25|$|In March 1856 the Post Office {{issued the}} first postage stamp to feature Thomas Jefferson. The exact {{date of issue}} is not clear. Scott Specialized Catalogue of United States Stamps and Covers {{establishes}} the release date with the first known use of this issue, March 24, 1856. The first <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> stamp was in imperforate form, engraved and printed by Toppan, Carpenter, Casilear & Co. The Jefferson issue saw postal duty from the spring of 1856 to the summer of 1857. The engraving of Jefferson was modeled after {{a portrait of the}} President by Gilbert Stuart. By mid-1857 the stamps were issued with the top and bottom design projections omitted and with perforations. This printing was issued in at least six major color variations.|$|E
25|$|The first printed {{newspaper}} of India was in English, and was called Hicky’s Bengal Gazette. It was edited {{and published by}} James Augustus Hicky, an ex-employee of the East India Company. The first <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> newspaper came out in 1780 and carried only classified advertisements on its front page. It was a weekly newspaper and generally dealt with the arrival and departure of Europeans, timings of steamers, fashionable news from London, Paris and Vienna, and personal news. It attended {{to the needs of}} the small European community of Calcutta. Many other Anglo-Indian newspapers emerged after Hicky’s pattern- such as John Bull, Calcutta Journal, Bengal Harkaru. In the year 1781, Hicky’s Bengal Gazette was forced to close down after Hicky published a scandalous story about Warren Hastings, the then Governor-General and his wife.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, the Electronic Transactions on Artificial Intelligence was {{launched}} as an open access journal by the European Coordinating Committee for Artificial Intelligence. This journal used a two-stage review process. In the first stage, papers that passed a quick screen by the editors were immediately {{published on the}} Transaction's discussion website {{for the purpose of}} on-line public discussion during a period of at least three months, where the contributors' names were made public except in exceptional cases. At the end of the discussion period, the authors were invited to submit a revised version of the article, and anonymous referees decided whether the revised manuscript would be accepted to the journal or not, but without any option for the referees to propose further changes. The last <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> journal appeared in 2001.|$|E

25|$|The {{flagship}} title, My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, is {{a monthly}} comic book series that debuted on November 28, 2012. The series is typically written in story arcs that span either two or four issues apiece; Katie Cook and Andy Price write and illustrate the first arc, respectively, while Heather Nuhfer and Amy Mebberson perform {{the same on}} the second. It {{was accompanied by a}} secondary publication, Micro-Series, which ran for 10 issues from February to December 2013. Each <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> title centered around a single character, with Thom Zahler writing the first issue and various writers and artists involved with the others. A second title, subtitled Friends Forever, debuted on January 22, 2014 with the first issue penned by Alex de Campi; it consisted of single-issue stories, each focusing on a different pair of characters. Friends Forever ended in April 2017 after 38 issues and was replaced by a third title, Legends of Magic, that same month. This series presents stories that center on key figures connected to the history and development of magic in Equestria. IDW has also published several one-off issues.|$|E
25|$|In 1611, {{her father}} was working with Agostino Tassi to {{decorate}} the vaults of Casino delle Muse inside the Palazzo Pallavicini-Rospigliosi in Rome, so Orazio hired the painter to tutor his daughter privately. During this tutelage, Tassi raped Artemisia. Another man, Cosimo Quorli, was also involved. After the rape, Artemisia continued to {{have sexual relations with}} Tassi, with the expectation {{that they were going to}} be married and with the hope to restore her dignity and her future. Tassi reneged on his promise to marry Artemisia. Nine months after the rape, when he learnt that Artemisia and Tassi were not going to be married, Orazio pressed charges against Tassi. Orazio also claimed that Tassi stole a painting of Judith from the Gentileschi household. The major <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> trial was the fact that Tassi had taken Artemisia's virginity. If Artemisia had not been a virgin before Tassi raped her, the Gentileschis would not have been able to press charges. During the ensuing seven-month trial, it was discovered that Tassi had planned to murder his wife, had engaged in adultery with his sister-in-law, and planned to steal some of Orazio’s paintings. During the trial, Artemisia was subjected to a gynecological examination and torture using thumbscrews to verify her testimony. At the end of the trial Tassi was exiled from Rome, although they never carried out the sentence. The trial influenced the feminist view of Artemisia Gentileschi during the late twentieth century.|$|E

500|$|On February 17, 1963, an <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>This</b> Week {{contained}} an article, [...] "Make Freedom Really Ring", written by two Connecticut writers, Eric Hatch and Eric Sloane. In the article, {{they suggested that}} every July 4, all bells in the country ring for four minutes, and radio stations broadcast the ringing for two minutes. Readers across the country took {{the advice of the}} magazine's editor, and contacted local officials in support of a nationwide bell-ringing observance. Concurrently, a resolution was proposed in Congress by Connecticut Senator Abraham Ribicoff that called for the ringing of bells nationwide at 2 p.m every July 4. Eastern Daylight Time. The bill passed both the Senate and House of Representatives later that year.|$|E
500|$|Reagan's {{opponent}} in the 1984 presidential election was former Vice President Walter Mondale. With questions about Reagan's age, and a weak performance in the first presidential debate, his ability {{to perform the duties}} of president for another term was questioned. His apparent confused and forgetful behavior was evident to his supporters; they had previously known him clever and witty. Rumors began to circulate that he had Alzheimer's disease. Reagan rebounded in the second debate, and confronted questions about his age, quipping, [...] "I will not make age an <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience," [...] which generated applause and laughter, even from Mondale himself.|$|E
500|$|It was Scalia's {{view that}} clear lines of {{separation}} among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches follow {{directly from the}} Constitution, with no branch allowed to exercise powers granted to another branch. In his early days on the Court, he authored a powerful—and solitary—dissent in 1988's Morrison v. Olson, in which the Court's majority upheld the Independent Counsel law. Scalia's thirty-page draft dissent surprised Justice Harry Blackmun for its emotional content; Blackmun felt [...] "it could be cut down to ten pages if Scalia omitted the screaming". Scalia indicated that the law was an unwarranted encroachment on the executive branch by the legislative. He warned, [...] "Frequently an <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> sort will come before the Court clad, so to speak, in sheep's clothing... But this wolf comes as a wolf".|$|E
