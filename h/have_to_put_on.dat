500|$|The episode makes several {{references}} to the automotive industry crisis of 2008–2009 and the financial crisis of 2007–2010. When Liz asks why Jack is taking a bus to Washington he replies [...] "ever since these buffoons from Detroit took private planes {{the rest of us}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> a show," [...] a reference to controversial travel methods by several CEOs en route to a November 19 congressional hearing.

500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Justin Francis, and co-directed by Nick Cannon {{on the island of}} Eleuthera in the Bahamas. The video became notable for the pair, {{due to the fact that}} it was during its conception and recording that they began dating, and eventually wed two months later. The video was shot in early April 2008, but was delayed until May, with several critics suggesting it because of the couples engagement. In an interview with Fox News, Cannon spoke of his feelings when first speaking with Carey regarding the video:"From the first time we sat down to discuss the video at the Beverly Hills Hotel, we connected. We had so much in common spiritually, and we laugh at the same things. I didn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> my Mac Daddy suave mode. I was able to be myself with her. We are both eternally 12 years old." [...] The pair eloped in the Bahamas, at Carey's private estate in Eleuthera, and wed on April 30, 2008. The couple stayed on the island for over two weeks after the nuptials for their honeymoon, which is why the video was delayed until mid-May, so Carey would be able to promote it in time.|$|E
