The aim of {{this study}} is to develop a {{participatory}} strategy for the <b>in-service</b> <b>training</b> <b>of</b> <b>teachers,</b> with regard to the role and functions of role players on macro, meso and micro level. To achieve this aim, the objectives of this research are: > the exploration and description of in-service training models with regard to prerequisites of effective training and the roles and functions of stakeholders on macro, meso and micro levels. > the exploration and description of teachers' needs and expectations with regard to in-service training; > the exploration and description of trainers' (district-officers) and facilitators' (head-office provincial) perceptions of teachers' needs and expectations with regard to in-service training; and > the description of a participatory strategy for the <b>in-service</b> <b>training</b> <b>of</b> <b>teachers.</b> A qualitative approach was followed. Twelve focus group interviews were held with primary school teachers from three different districts in the Gauteng Department of Education. Individual interviews were also held with three officials from district offices and three officials from provincial head-office. From the research it was concluded that the meso level forms the core level in the <b>in-service</b> <b>training</b> <b>of</b> <b>teachers.</b> The critical aspects on meso level were the training centres. At these centres, school management teams and other teacher trainers should be trained on a macro level. These teacher trainers train their teachers in school training committees, consisting of school principals and their management, teachers and other partners. It also recommended that centres are the most effective way of disseminating information to schools. School management teams and teacher trainers in turn disseminate information to their schools. Where a school or teacher experience difficulty they could either consult their school training committees or refer to the centres for assistance. Another important conclusion is that for this participatory strategy to be effective, school principals should accept teacher development as part of their management v responsibilities. This strategy is based on teacher involvement on all levels from policy formulation right down to the planning and implementation of in-service training. Another important aspect of this strategy is for the education authorities to place a teacher trainer at every centre to assist with planning and training if this approach is to be successfully implemented.

40|$|M. Ed. (Teaching Science) The <b>In-Service</b> <b>Training</b> <b>of</b> <b>Teachers</b> in Venda {{is fraught}} with {{problems}} such as inadequate provision, lack of proper planning and organisation, lack of policy guidelines, inappropriate delivery systems, lack of proper coordination, lack of dedicated and experienced staff members who can plan and implement courses to address the real needs of Primary and Secondary School teachers, lack of inadequate financial resources and centralised accessible venues for all Primary and Secondary teachers' courses. To reach possible solutions to the abovementioned problems, a literature survey of In-Service Teacher Education was undertaken to investigate the situation in Venda and an empirical study was also undertaken. The research yielded the following results:- [...] . [...] . The formulation of an In-Service Training Policy Statement with clear aims, objectives and priorities based {{on the needs of}} teachers is of paramount importance. A policy statement which will facilitate a system of in-service training that is relevant to real, identified needs, planned and managed in a coherent and controlled manner is needed. Akey theme in in-service training is a partnership between all those involved: - teachers, principals, lecturers, subject advisors, circuit inspectors, area managers and providers of training, to create a continuous, open process of consultation, aimed at identifying needs and designing, delivering, evaluating, and following up training activities. Coordination was found to be lacking in Venda. All involved in this process should be invited to contribute to its development. Efficient coordination is crucial to the success of any in-service training plan. The training of in-service staff is required, so that they can conduct courses with Primary and Secondary School teachers. Seminars and symposia once a month can help to bring the staff up to date on specific aspects of Primary and Secondary school work from a theoretical and practical perspective. Subject advisors should be appointed in all subjects and in each of the education areas. In this way, in-service training programmes can reach all the teachers much sooner. Decentralisation of existing Ramaano Mbulaheni In-Service Training Centre into two professional centres and a network of teachers' centres which are located at sites accessible to teachers was an important finding of the research. In this way, arrangements can be made to ensure that courses are properly planned, monitored, and evaluated by a coordinated team of all involved. Teachers' centres are also an important element in pursuit of quality education. Close attention needs to be paid to the allocation of budgets for the <b>In-Service</b> <b>Training</b> <b>of</b> <b>Teachers.</b> Accurate financial control to encourage value from funding is also necessary. Training resources for in-service training were found to be inadequately provided.

Yet there remains {{the task of}} developing sociological explanations in this field. As an especially dynamic phase, the period designated merits detailed study. Teachers' professional development is conceptualized in three ways: in relation {{to change in the}} education system, to the place of teaching as a profession, and in terms of professional learning. National INSET schemes implicitly threatened teacher autonomy, yet professionalism could be redefined at the micro- level, and this study therefore addresses macro- and micro-sociological issues. The empirical research concentrates with increasing intensity on school-focused INSET experiences, through data from documentary sources, in-depth interviews, and participant observation. Chapter 1 explains the rationale for the investigation and demarcates the field of study. Chapter 2 outlines the background to the Local Education Authority Training Grant Scheme and similar initiatives. Chapter 3 sets out the sociological basis for the analysis of INSET phenomena. Methodological issues are addressed in Chapter 4, including the choice of case studies, the challenges of re-analyzing data and the criteria for selecting cases. The analysis presents a macro-sociological perspective in Chapter 5, then examines how national and LEA priorities are implemented in schools in Chapter 6. Micro-level case studies explore specific aspects of INSET: across different phases in Chapter 7 and on using information technology in Chapter 8. Chapter 9 investigates INSET for art. Chapter 10 summarizes the ways this thesis contributes to knowledge about the professionalism and autonomy <b>of</b> <b>teachers</b> through the study of INSET during a critical period.

The purpose of the thesis is to explore the <b>in-service</b> teacher <b>training</b> phenomenon as it occurs in a national socio-economic context. The research ambition is accomplished in an exploratory field study design. I collected empirical data at different societal levels in Ghana’s education system, although the main contribution is drawn from a single case study, labeled School A. This thesis provides an analytical discussion of the findings I collected while in Ghana in October and November of 2006, interviewing the actors involved with these gaps, {{in the light of}} relevant theory. I apply Lave’s and Wenger’s (1991) theory of situated learning, and Wenger’s (1998) notion of community of practice as a theoretical framework for understanding better the phenomenon under investigation. The case study provides empirical evidence of how the untrained teachers learned to teach and used one another as resources. The research has, however, identified a range of mismatches between policy goals, official plans, real life practices, along with practical interruptions the teachers’ daily workplace learning. I conceptualize these reoccurring situations as gaps that occur at the school, as well as the macro (national educational level) and meso (school district level) level of education in Ghana. The gaps include lack of resources, communication, finances, in addition to managerial support and facilitation of learning at the micro level. The case study illuminates empirically that School A has developed a community of practice, although at a rudimentary and immature stage, a survival community of practice. I propose to apply the concept of community of practice with the purpose <b>of</b> <b>training</b> their untrained <b>teachers</b> and socializing them into professional teaching. In this perspective, the community of practice emerges as an ideal model to fill these recurrent gaps. In the discussion, I address critical factors and preconditions for the ideal model of a community of practice to work as learning and knowledge structures to facilitate <b>in-service</b> <b>training</b> <b>of</b> unskilled <b>teachers...</b>|$|R

A major implication of the findings is that the identification of prospective and serving teachers’ cognitive styles may aid teacher educators in planning appropriate programmes for both pre- and <b>in-service</b> <b>training</b> <b>of</b> <b>teachers...</b>|$|E
40|$|M. Ed. (Educational Management) The veld {{school is}} one of the most recent {{developments}} in the educational provision of the Transvaal Education Department. The effectiveness of the veld school is determined by the quality of education and the enthusiasm manifested by the veld-school teacher as the pursuer of a profession. The professional development and <b>in-service</b> <b>training</b> <b>of</b> the veld-school <b>teacher,</b> therefore, deserves the attention of the Transvaal Education Department, as well as the active measures of the veld-school principal. The rapid technological development of today has caused change and innovation to become an indissoluble part of the daily structure of life. The two most important educational bodies, namely the family and the school, are experiencing problems in keeping pace with this constant change and innovation. The problem of keeping pace with change and innovation may lead to voids in the most important educational situations. It, therefore, concerns the family as well as the school as educational bodies. These voids manifest themselves especially when it comes to the commitment of values and norms to the child. In this study the attempts made by the Transvaal Education Department to overcome these voids in the education of the child have been probed. Initially the subject Youth Preparedness was introduced in an attempt to achieve this goal. The ambitions set for the subject could not be realized within this framework...|$|R
40|$|A teacher’s {{willingness}} to accept inclusion {{has been identified as}} an indicator of the quality of experience that a student with special needs will have in the classroom The purpose of this exploratory study was twofold: (1) to describe the overall perceptions of working with students with special needs and (2) to determine how teachers in Louisiana are currently working with students with special needs.   A total <b>of</b> 152 <b>teachers</b> attended the Louisiana agricultural education teacher’s summer conference with 43 % completing a three part survey instrument.   Data analysis indicated that teachers are confident in their ability to work with students with special needs and they agree that they can incorporate various areas of inclusion within their programs. However, they disagreed that they have received adequate in-service opportunities related to special education.   Regarding educational strategies, teachers in this study identified all of the given inclusion strategies as being used regularly in their programs with the exception of tutoring after school.   They also identified these educational practices as being highly effective within their programs. Due to the exploratory nature of this study, additional research is recommended to further investigate the <b>in-service</b> and <b>training</b> needs <b>of</b> <b>teachers</b> in Louisiana...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} few years it has become the {{responsibility}} of most public school teachers in Rhode Island to find ways of accumulating six credit points in order to satisfy a state certification renewal requirement. A number <b>of</b> <b>teachers</b> participate in appropriate work conferences, serve on committees for their school department, assume leadership in professional organizations, or are active in community affairs. Although these activities may enhance their professional prestige, they carry little or no certification credit value. An attempt has been made to ascertain the percentage <b>of</b> <b>teachers</b> who are taking courses solely to satisfy certification requirements. Furthermore, it has been pointed out that a local community has certain responsibilities to provide an etfective program of in-service education whereby the teachers can earn credit points and more readily solve their own specific problems. To arrive at conclusions, questionnaires were sent to a number of school superintendents throughout the United States. A report has been made of some of the practices in <b>in-service</b> <b>training</b> that these educators have used successfully in their school systems. The <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> Providence were asked to eYaluate the program available to them. This was done by means of questionnaires and personal interviews. The results of these have been tabulated and recommendations made for improving the <b>in-service</b> <b>training</b> ot <b>teachers</b> <b>of</b> Providence, Rhode Island...|$|R
