25|$|The JWST has {{a history}} of major cost overruns and delays which have {{resulted}} from outside factors such as delays in deciding on a launch vehicle and adding extra funding for contingencies. The first budget estimates were that the observatory would cost $1.6 billion and launch in 2011, but NASA has now scheduled the telescope for a 2019 launch on a budget that has grown to $8.8 billion. In 2011, the United States House of Representatives voted to terminate funding, after about $3 billion had been spent and 75% of its hardware was in production. Funding was restored and capped at $8 billion. , the telescope remained on schedule for a spring 2019 launch and within the 2011 revised budget.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the tax dodger {{phenomenon}} is approached {{from the perspective}} of the tax evasion identified as a consequence of the fiscal inspection activity. Based on the data referring to the level and dynamics of the tax dodger phenomenon have been made appreciations regarding the fiscal discipline of the Romanian tax payer and to the attitude of the qualified organs in discovering and sanction of the fraudulent tax evasion, in the period 1995 - 2005. In this sense have been analyzed a series of indicators like: the number of verifications, the number of tax evasion cases, the frequency of tax evasion, the total value of the identified tax evasion, the real volume of the identified tax evasion, the medium measure of tax evasion, the penalty rate and the potential and effective multiplier of tax evasion. Also it has been realized an analysis on the capacity of the sums additionally drawn after the identification of tax evasion of financing the budget’s deficit. Thus, in 2005, the additionally drawn sums have exceeded the consolidated <b>general</b> <b>budget’s</b> deficit, but unfortunately, these have been received only in a proportion of 21, 4 %, the receiving remaining difference, of 2, 265, 766 RON, representing 97, 4 % from the consolidated <b>general</b> <b>budget’s</b> deficit. tax evasion, Romanian economy, fiscal regulations, fiscal discipline...|$|R
