40|$|This article {{investigates the}} change in {{deploying}} time of an active hood lift mechanism of a passenger vehicle activated by a gunpowder actuator. Especially, in this work, the deploying time is investigated by changing the principal design parameters of the <b>hinge</b> <b>part</b> of the hood mechanism. After briefly introducing the working principle of the active hood lift mechanism operated by the gunpowder actuator, the governing dynamic equations of the active hood lift mechanism are formulated for deploying motion. Subsequently, using the governing equations of motion, the response time for deploying the hood lift mechanism is investigated by changing several geometric locations such as the location of actuator. Then, a comparison is made of the total response time to completely deploy the hood lift mechanism with the existing conventional hood lift mechanism and the proposed active hood lift mechanism. In addition, the workable driving speed of the proposed active hood lift mechanism is compared with the conventional one by changing the powder volume of the actuator...|$|E

40|$|Self-folding is {{the ability}} of the {{structure}} to fold and/or unfold without human intervention or any application of external manipulation. It is known that the structure of folding object consists of two essential parts. These parts are the faces and the creases. In this paper, it is assumed that the faces could be built by using solid materials, and the crease lines can be built using soft material which provides a high bent ability. Furthermore, these two materials should be combined built without using any connections between them. Fortunately, the 3 D printer provides this capability. It can print two types of different materials at the same time for the same structure. Therefore, a 3 D printer is chosen to fabricate a folding structure using two types of material. These types are the Vero for solid faces and Tango plus FLX 930 for the soft creases lines. The soft material at <b>hinge</b> <b>part</b> (creases lines) subjected to the load directly when the structure folds. It should have {{a clear view of the}} mechanical properties of this material. Therefore, several mechanical tests for Tango FLX 930 material are operated to calculate its mechanical properties and find the force that required to fold it...|$|E

5000|$|The name [...] "bivalve" [...] {{is derived}} from the Latin bis, meaning [...] "two", and valvae, meaning [...] "leaves of a door". [...] Not all animals with shells with two <b>hinged</b> <b>parts</b> are {{classified}} under Bivalvia; other animals with paired valves include certain gastropods (small sea snails in the family Juliidae), members of the phylum Brachiopoda [...] and the minute crustaceans known as ostracods and conchostrachans.|$|R
50|$|A bivalve {{shell is}} part of the body, the {{exoskeleton}} or shell, of a bivalve mollusk. In life, the shell of this class of mollusks is composed of two <b>hinged</b> <b>parts</b> or valves.

The shells of bivalves commonly wash up on beaches (often as separate valves) and along the edges of lakes, rivers, and streams.|$|R
40|$|Tracking the {{movement}} of migratory freshwater fish is essential to those invested in rebuilding declining fish populations. Using strontium isotopic signatures to match calcified fish tissues to streams where fish spawn is a useful method of tracking migratory fish where physical tracking methods such as radio, acoustic, or external tags, have proven unsuccessful. In this study, we develop tools to practice this method of tracking fish in Lake Roosevelt and its upstream tributaries in Washington State by analyzing the elemental concentrations and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of water samples, and mussel shell samples. 	This study evaluates whether mussel shells act as an appropriate proxy for water chemistry by comparing the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotope ratios of water samples to the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotope ratios of mussel shells sampled from the same, or nearby, locations. We compare concentrations of Ba, Ca, Cd, Cu, Fe, Mg, Pb, Sr, and U {{in the water and}} mussel shell samples to determine the feasibility of using mussel shells as a proxy for water chemistry. If it is determined that the concentrations of these elements in mussel shells reflect that of the surrounding water composition, the elemental composition of mussel shells can be compared to that of calcified tissues in fish, such as otoliths, to infer the location of the natal stream. 	We report analyses of water and mussel shell samples collected from Lake Roosevelt, Sanpoil River, Spokane River, Colville River, Kettle River, Pend Oreille River, Kootenay River, and Columbia River in Washington State. Each of these rivers is a tributary to Lake Roosevelt, and each flows through different geologic units. We hypothesize that the differences in the rock units of each stream’s watershed are reflected in the elemental concentrations and strontium isotopic ratios of water in each stream and in the lake. We also hypothesize that the composition of the mussel shells will match the composition of the water samples, therefore allowing us to use the mussel shells as a proxy for local water chemistry. Additionally, we hypothesize that the composition of the mussel shells will vary by location, and {{that we will be able}} to then infer where a fish is from by matching the composition of the fish in question to the mussels we have analyzed. 	We found that 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values for water and mussel hinge samples collected from tributaries east of Lake Roosevelt are significantly higher than the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values for samples collected from tributaries west of Lake Roosevelt with averages of 0. 7235 and 0. 7089, respectively. The average 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios for water and mussel hinge samples collected within Lake Roosevelt is 0. 7158, which is between the averages for samples collected east and west of the lake. Generally, older rocks are exposed on the east side of the lake, and younger rocks on the west side of the lake, so our 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values support the hypothesis that geologic units are a primary control on water chemistry, and that tributary compositions mix to form an average weighed by flow in Lake Roosevelt. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values for water and mussel shell samples collected from the same locations have a strong, positive linear correlation, suggesting that mussel shell 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios reflect the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios of the ambient water. With these data, we can distinguish between different streams and the lake, but cannot distinguish between samples from within the same stream or within Lake Roosevelt. 	The Sr:Ca and Fe:Ca ratios of water samples show positive correlations with mussel shell compositions, with R 2 values of 0. 82 and 0. 52, respectively. Ratios of Mg, Ba, Cu, Cd, Pb, and U to Ca showed little or no positive correlation between water and mussel shell samples. The elemental concentration data collected for this study do not demonstrate whether a correlation between elemental ratios in water samples and elemental ratios in mussel shell samples collected from the same location exists. Positive Sr:Ca and Fe:Ca correlations for water versus mussel shell samples indicate that perhaps for some elements, the composition of mussel shells are representative of the composition of ambient water. Using elemental concentration ratios to complement 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotopic data may enhance our ability to identify correlations between water and mussel shell samples, and ultimately between mussel shell and otolith samples. 	The <b>hinge</b> <b>part</b> of a mussel shell may be used as a proxy for local water composition because the mussel shell composition reflects that of the local ambient water. The hinge of the mussel has the same composition as the whole mussel shell. 	We measured variation of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios in the water among different streams and Lake Roosevelt. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values for samples collected in tributaries east of Lake Roosevelt, which erode older rocks, are higher for mussel shell and water samples than the average 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values for mussel shell and water samples collected in tributaries west of Lake Roosevelt, which flow through younger rocks...|$|E

500|$|Bivalvia, in {{previous}} centuries {{referred to as}} the Lamellibranchiata and Pelecypoda, is a class of marine and freshwater molluscs that have laterally compressed bodies enclosed by a shell consisting of two <b>hinged</b> <b>parts.</b> [...] Bivalves as a group have no head and they lack some usual molluscan organs like the radula and the odontophore. They include the clams, oysters, cockles, mussels, scallops, and numerous other families that live in saltwater, {{as well as a number}} of families that live in freshwater. The majority are filter feeders. The gills have evolved into ctenidia, specialised organs for feeding and breathing. Most bivalves bury themselves in sediment where they are relatively safe from predation. Others lie on the sea floor or attach themselves to rocks or other hard surfaces. Some bivalves, such as the scallops and file shells, can swim. The shipworms bore into wood, clay, or stone and live inside these substances.|$|R
