5|$|Generally, {{the player}} starts {{out with a}} Dungeon Heart and some Imps. The Dungeon <b>Heart</b> <b>has</b> the same purpose as the {{original}} game: it serves as the dungeon's life force. If destroyed, the player loses. In Dungeon Keeper 2, the <b>heart</b> <b>has</b> additional functions: regenerating mana (used to cast spells), doubling as a gold-storage area, producing Imps, and sending certain creatures to investigate threats it detects. Gold is the currency used to construct rooms, traps, and doors, and pay minions. Gold is obtained primarily by digging gold and gem seams, the latter providing an unlimited supply. This is performed by the Imps, the main workforce of the dungeon, who dig and claim tiles for the player to control. Another main task Imps perform is the fortification of walls adjacent to tiles owned by the player, although this no longer makes them impenetrable to enemies, but merely makes digging take longer.|$|E
50|$|In 2006 he briefly {{came out}} of {{retirement}} to advise on a complicated procedure which required removing a transplant heart from a patient whose own <b>heart</b> <b>had</b> recovered.

5|$|The {{mammalian}} <b>heart</b> <b>has</b> four chambers, two upper atria, {{the receiving}} chambers, and two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers. The <b>heart</b> <b>has</b> four valves, which separate its chambers and ensures blood flows {{in the correct}} direction through the heart (preventing backflow). After gas exchange in the pulmonary capillaries (blood vessels in the lungs), oxygen-rich blood returns to the left atrium via {{one of the four}} pulmonary veins. Blood flows nearly continuously back into the atrium, which acts as the receiving chamber, and from here through an opening into the left ventricle. Most blood flows passively into the heart while both the atria and ventricles are relaxed, but {{toward the end of the}} ventricular relaxation period, the left atrium will contract, pumping blood into the ventricle. The heart also requires nutrients and oxygen found in blood like other muscles, and is supplied via coronary arteries.|$|E
5|$|While not {{initially}} a success with North American audiences, Angel <b>Heart</b> <b>has</b> gained a cult following. Filmmaker Christopher Nolan stated {{the film was}} {{a major influence on}} his 2000 film Memento. Video game developer Ken Levine stated that Angel Heart was one of several films that inspired the first-person shooter game BioShock Infinite.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} that bathes the organs in hemolymph. The <b>heart</b> <b>has</b> three chambers: two {{auricles}} receiving blood from the gills, and a single ventricle. The ventricle is muscular and pumps hemolymph into the aorta, {{and then to the}} rest of the body. Some bivalves have a single aorta, but most also have a second, usually smaller, aorta serving the hind parts of the animal.|$|E

5|$|The {{heart is}} cone-shaped, with its base {{positioned}} upwards and tapering {{down to the}} apex. An adult <b>heart</b> <b>has</b> a mass of 250–350 grams (9–12oz). The heart is typically {{the size of a}} fist: 12cm (5in) in length, 8cm (3.5in) wide, and 6cm (2.5in) in thickness. Well-trained athletes can have much larger hearts due to the effects of exercise on the heart muscle, similar to the response of skeletal muscle.|$|E
5|$|The series {{follows the}} adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) and Lady Rainicorn (voiced by Niki Yang) go searching for Finn and Jake, who have been missing for three weeks after {{fighting}} with the Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny). It is revealed that Ricardio, the Ice King's living <b>heart,</b> <b>has</b> trapped them and wishes to marry Bubblegum.

In this episode, Mulder and Scully investigate a series of murders in which the <b>heart</b> <b>has</b> {{been removed from the}} victims. A writer who lives next door to Mulder is writing a novel about the murders before they actually happen and soon, Scully finds herself confused and drawn to the writer, who has a romantic interest in her.|$|E
5|$|The {{systemic}} <b>heart</b> <b>has</b> muscular contractile {{walls and}} consists of a single ventricle and two atria, one for {{each side of the}} body. The blood vessels consist of arteries, capillaries and veins and are lined with a cellular endothelium which is quite unlike that of most other invertebrates. The blood circulates through the aorta and capillary system, to the vena cavae, after which the blood is pumped through the gills by the auxiliary hearts and back to the main heart. Much of the venous system is contractile, which helps circulate the blood.|$|E

5|$|Cold shock {{response}} is the physiological response of organisms to sudden cold, especially cold water, {{and is a}} common cause of death from immersion in very cold water, such as by falling through thin ice. The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in drowning. The cold water can also cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction; the <b>heart</b> <b>has</b> {{to work harder to}} pump the same volume of blood throughout the body, and for people with heart disease, this additional workload can cause the heart to go into arrest. A person who survives the initial minute after falling into cold water can survive for at least thirty minutes provided they do not drown. The ability to stay afloat declines substantially after about ten minutes as the chilled muscles lose strength and co-ordination.|$|E
5|$|The cardiac {{examination}} includes inspection, {{feeling the}} chest with the hands (palpation) and listening with a stethoscope (auscultation). It involves assessment of signs {{that may be}} visible on a person's hands (such as splinter haemorrhages), joints and other areas. A person's pulse is taken, usually at the radial artery near the wrist, {{in order to assess}} for the rhythm and strength of the pulse. The blood pressure is taken, using either a manual or automatic sphygmomanometer or using a more invasive measurement from within the artery. Any elevation of the jugular venous pulse is noted. A person's chest is felt for any transmitted vibrations from the heart, and then listened to with a stethoscope. A normal <b>heart</b> <b>has</b> two hearts sounds – additional heart sounds or heart murmurs may also be able to be heard and may point to disease. Additional tests may be conducted to assess a person's heart murmurs if they are present, and peripheral signs of heart disease such as swollen feet or fluid in the lungs may be assessed.|$|E
5|$|The <b>heart</b> <b>has</b> four chambers, two upper atria, the {{receiving}} chambers, and two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers. The atria open into the ventricles via the atrioventricular valves, {{present in the}} atrioventricular septum. This distinction is visible also {{on the surface of}} the heart as the coronary sulcus. There is an ear-shaped structure in the upper right atrium called the right atrial appendage, or auricle, and another in the upper left atrium, the left atrial appendage. The right atrium and the right ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the right heart. Similarly, the left atrium and the left ventricle together are sometimes referred to as the left heart. The ventricles are separated from each other by the interventricular septum, visible {{on the surface of the}} heart as the anterior longitudinal sulcus and the posterior interventricular sulcus.|$|E

5|$|The low oxygen level {{leads to}} {{physiologic}} constriction of the pulmonary arteries to correct ventilation-perfusion mismatching, which puts excessive {{strain on the}} right side of the heart. When this leads to right sided heart failure, it is known as cor pulmonale. Symptoms of this disorder occur because the <b>heart</b> <b>has</b> difficulty pumping blood from the body through the lungs. Fluid may, therefore, accumulate in the skin of the legs in the form of edema (swelling), and in the abdominal cavity in the form of ascites; decreased exercise tolerance and exertional chest pain may occur. On physical examination, characteristic findings are the presence of a raised jugular venous pressure, a palpable parasternal heave, a heart murmur due to blood leaking through the tricuspid valve, hepatomegaly (an enlarged liver), ascites and leg edema. Cor pulmonale occurs in about a third of all people with OHS.|$|E

The duo and Kristoff's reindeer Sven, where being chased by wolves on the way and encounter the sister's snowman, Olaf, who was unknowingly brought to life by Elsa and later leads them to her palace. The sisters reunite, but Elsa is reluctant to help Anna by ending the eternal winter. Upset, she loses control of her powers, striking Anna in her heart. Desperate to get her sister to leave, Elsa creates a giant snow creature, and it throws Anna and her friends away from the palace. Upon noticing Anna's hair is turning white, Kristoff takes her back to his adoptive family of trolls. Pabbie tells Anna that her <b>heart</b> <b>has</b> been frozen by her sister's magic and only an act of true love can save her from freezing completely.

5|$|Mammals are {{a diverse}} class of animals, mostly {{terrestrial}} {{but some are}} aquatic and others have evolved flapping or gliding flight. They mostly have four limbs but some aquatic mammals have no limbs or limbs modified into fins and the forelimbs of bats are modified into wings. The legs of most mammals are situated below the trunk, which is held well clear of the ground. The bones of mammals are well ossified and their teeth, which are usually differentiated, are coated in a layer of prismatic enamel. The teeth are shed once (milk teeth) during the animal's lifetime or not at all, {{as is the case}} in cetaceans. Mammals have three bones in the middle ear and a cochlea in the inner ear. They are clothed in hair and their skin contains glands which secrete sweat. Some of these glands are specialized as mammary glands, producing milk to feed the young. Mammals breathe with lungs and have a muscular diaphragm separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs. The mammalian <b>heart</b> <b>has</b> four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate. Nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea.|$|E
