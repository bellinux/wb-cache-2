5|$|The {{southern}} painted turtle's diet {{changes with}} age. Juveniles' diet consists of 13% vegetation, while the adults eat 88% vegetation. This perhaps {{shows that the}} turtle prefers small larvae and other prey, but can only obtain significant amounts while young. The reversal of feeding habits with age has also {{been seen in the}} <b>false</b> <b>map</b> <b>turtle,</b> which inhabits some of the same range. The most common plants eaten by adult southern painted turtles are duckweed and algae, and the most common prey items are dragonfly larvae and crayfish.|$|E

50|$|A {{variety of}} threats face this species, {{including}} {{the destruction of}} nests of eggs by animals and insects, falling victim to gill nets, and being shot. <b>False</b> <b>map</b> <b>turtles,</b> much like red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans), have also been collected for the pet trade.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Several {{studies have}} shown that wetland loss and habitat {{fragmentation}} can alter diversity and abundance of herpetofauna, but taxonomic attention has been skewed towards amphibians. We assessed responses of aquatic turtles to features at multiple spatial scales in an intensively farmed region of the Midwestern United States. Spatially hierarchical sampling was conducted from 2001 to 2003 in 35 randomly selected 23 -km 2 cells throughout the upper Wabash River basin in Indiana. Hoop nets were used at wetlands to capture common snapping turtles (Chely-dra serpentina serpentina) (n= 258), midland painted turtles (Chrysemys picta marginata) (151), eastern spiny softshells (Apalone spinifera spinifera) (70), red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans) (59), northern <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> (Graptemys geographica) (27), <b>false</b> <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> (Graptemys pseudogeographica pseudogeographica) (6), Blanding’s turtles (Emy-doidea blandingii) (3), and stinkpot turtles (Sternotherus odoratus) (3). We examined the degree to which these aquatic species were nonrandomly distributed in 14 landscapes. Assemblages of turtles generally were random and the extent of nestedness was influenced by the diversity of landcover, the proportion of grassland, and the total length of roads in each landscape. The occurrence and abundance of several species also were modeled to test hypotheses regarding the importance of site, patch, and landscape-level variables. Red-eared sliders appeared to be most sensitive to habitat fragmentation, whereas pain-ted <b>turtles,</b> snapping <b>turtles,</b> <b>map</b> <b>turtles,</b> and spiny softshells were less affected. Factors at multiple spatial scales affect turtle distributions, suggesting differential responses to landscape fragmentation...|$|R
50|$|Throughout the pet trade, Mississippi, common, and Ouachita <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> were bred and hatched {{out by the}} {{thousands}} in the 1970s. Various other turtles were available, but as the salmonellosis Four-inch Law was established, <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> and others slowly decreased in popularity. Today, these same three still hold the title for most common among the pet trade. Other species being captive-bred more often include the Texas <b>map</b> <b>turtle,</b> Cagle's <b>map</b> <b>turtle,</b> and the black-knobbed <b>map</b> <b>turtle.</b> Some harder-to-find <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> include the yellow-blotched <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> and the Pearl River <b>map</b> <b>turtle.</b>|$|R

Basking is important to these turtles, and they may even be found on steep, slippery snags.|$|E
50|$|The Sabine map turtle (G. o. sabinensis), was {{observed}} and specimens collected (Four specimens), {{as far south}} as the upper Mermentau River in 1893 and 1894. In a 2013 observation field study of the Upper Mermentau, Lake Arthur, and 5 major tributaries including Bayou Plaquemine Brule, 73% of the turtles observed were G. sabinensis. The Graptemys pseudogeographica (the <b>false</b> <b>map</b> <b>turtle),</b> {{was observed}} as approaching extirpation in the drainage area accounted for only 0.2% of all turtles observed.|$|E
50|$|It {{is found}} in the Pascagoula River in the United States.

50|$|Also {{known as}} a “sawback” turtle, the {{carapace}} features a vertebral row of low spines, and is serrated on the posterior rim. The carapace is olive to brown in color with light yellowish markings with dark borders. The plastron color varies from cream to yellow and is patterned with dark lines along the seams in juveniles. The body color of the <b>false</b> <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> is grayish brown to blackish and is marked with light brown, yellow, or whitish stripes. The eye can be light yellow, white, or green and is crossed with a dark bar. Narrow hooked marks behind the eye fuse with dorsal lines {{on the head and}} neck. Also, small light-colored spots occur below the eye and on the chin.|$|E
50|$|The yellow-blotched <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> (Graptemys flavimaculata), or yellow-blotched sawback, is {{a species}} of turtle in the Emydidae family. It {{is part of the}} narrow-headed group of <b>map</b> <b>turtles,</b> and is endemic to the {{southern}} United States.|$|R

50|$|<b>Map</b> <b>turtles</b> are {{considered}} habitat specialists {{and may be}} replaced by a more tolerant species when their habitat is altered. Unfortunately the effects of human interference by way boating and recreation on shorelines are likely impeding the <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> from re-establishing itself in natural areas. Thus, populations of Northern <b>map</b> <b>turtles</b> have probably declined across their entire natural range but they remain widespread and may be abundant in some locations. This species has classified as least concern by the IUCN.|$|R
50|$|The Alabama <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> (Graptemys pulchra) is {{a species}} of emydid turtle endemic to the {{southern}} United States. Differentiation from other turtle species includes a black stripe running {{down the center of}} its back with knobs extruding from it, but these projections wear down with age. T.H. Bean and L. Kumlen first collected the Alabama <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> in July 1876 from a lake near Montgomery, Alabama. Type locality for this species is Montgomery County, Alabama. Baur described and named the Alabama <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> in 1893. The genus Graptemys includes nine species of mostly aquatic turtles.|$|R

40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the principles of}} ecosystem management and utilized the Northern <b>Map</b> <b>turtle,</b> a species at risk, as a key indicator species to illustrate the importance of preserving riparian habitats and island complexes on an ecosystem scale. Overall, the study explored the population characteristics and use of habitat of the Northern <b>Map</b> <b>turtle</b> (Graptemys geographica) within a small bay within the Gananoque River system in South Eastern Ontario. Results from field observations showed that the bay population of Northern <b>Map</b> <b>turtles</b> appeared to be female biased. Use of habitat features differed by females, males and juveniles at different times throughout the summer (May-August). Females were frequently observed basking within the bay in May and June while {{males were more frequently}} observed throughout July and August. Nesting by female Northern <b>Map</b> <b>turtles</b> appeared to be concentrated atop small islands scattered throughout the bay. Nest sites were located within narrow bands of soils. The most prominent difference between site conditions at the monitored nests was soil moisture; this was likely the result of different soil materials at each site. Air and soil temperature did not differ significantly between sites. Additional research could be pursued on the bay population of Northern <b>Map</b> <b>turtles</b> looking at the following: movement patterns by females out of the bay post-nesting, genetic linkages to other satellite populations of Northern <b>Map</b> <b>turtles</b> in the Thousand Islands, hatchling success and sex composition, overall species health due to food availability and lastly the effects of anthropogenic stressors...|$|R

50|$|<b>Map</b> <b>turtles</b> {{are more}} {{carnivorous}} {{than most other}} members of the family Emydidae, and the northern <b>map</b> <b>turtle</b> is no exception. Adult females have wide heads and broad alveolar crushing surfaces in their mouths which they use to feed on molluscs, their primary prey, as well as insects and crayfish. Adult males are much smaller and have narrower heads and feed on smaller molluscs and insects. Like most other aquatic turtles, feeding always takes place in the water. In places where invasive molluscs such as zebra mussels and Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea) are abundant, they may become the most important food of female northern <b>map</b> <b>turtles.</b>|$|R
