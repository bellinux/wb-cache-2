6000|$|JULIA (doubtfully). <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that I {{am not the}} shallow, jealous, devilish {{tempered}} creature {{they all}} pretend I am? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Worthless!" [...] she repeated. [...] "I don't {{understand}} it, father. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that Mr. Thain {{would do}} you an ill turn like this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> {{the affair}} {{to have been}} {{carrying}} on with such perfect secresy?--The Campbells, the Dixons, did none of them know of the engagement?" ...|$|E
6000|$|COLONEL. 'You {{are very}} clever, Alice, but <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> think I <b>believe</b> {{that this is}} no shock to you? Oh, woman, why has this {{deception}} not struck you to the ground?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Halsey," [...] he said, [...] "I {{am going}} out to lunch. At least, I wish it to be thought that I am {{going out to}} lunch. As a matter of fact, I shall return in about ten minutes by the back way. I <b>do</b> not wish <b>you,</b> however, to know this. I {{want you to have}} it in your mind that I have gone to lunch and shall not be back until a quarter past two. If there are {{visitors}} for me--Inquirers of any sort--act exactly as <b>you</b> would have <b>done</b> if <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> that I was not in the building." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{just wish}} you could have seen that {{squirrel}} when I found him sitting {{at the front door}} of Sonny Hedgehog's hole, ready to get under cover {{at the first sign of}} danger! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> know, he <b>really</b> <b>believed</b> he had tired out the 'Squire and that there wasn't any danger he could come to harm! ...|$|R
6000|$|Britt, {{looking into}} her clear eyes, {{acquired}} a new confidence in her. [...] "Tell me, Miss Lambert, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> {{that your father}} comes to you in this way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|L. Because {{you have}} been taught that it is all evil--'only evil continually.' Somehow, often as people say that, they never seem, to me, to believe it? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> it? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See here, Le Drieux," [...] said Arthur; [...] "let us {{be honest}} with one another, now that the thing is settled and {{diplomacy}} is uncalled for. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that Jones is Jack Andrews?" ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked about}} it later, Betts was {{philosophical}} about the experience: It {{was one of those}} things where it was a job you can't say no to, even though I was nine months pregnant. ... It's weird, all the criticism and all the tough calls at Bazaar, and getting fired ultimately, those were all hard things to experience, but with hindsight, which is always 20/20, they were great experiences. I don't regret any of it at all. It was an amazing opportunity to learn how to edit a magazine in two years, and get it over with. There are a lot of lessons there, but the thing I always come back to is, if you're <b>doing</b> something <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> in, <b>you</b> never regret anything <b>you</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
60|$|You {{may think}} that I spoke in this way {{with a view to}} my indulgent {{language}} being repeated to Romayne, and so improving the position which I have already gained in his estimation. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> know, I <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> I meant it at the time! The poor fellow gratefully kissed my hand when I offered it to him--he was not able to speak. I wonder whether I am weak about Arthur? Say a kind word for him, when his conduct comes under notice--but pray don't mention this little frailty of mine; and don't suppose I have any sympathy with his weak-minded submission to Mrs. Romayne's prejudices. If I ever felt the smallest consideration for her (and I cannot call to mind any amiable emotion of that sort), her letter to Winterfield would have effectually extinguished it. There is something quite revolting to me in a deceitful woman.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> {{that the}} {{mutilated}} remains which you discovered this morning are {{the remains of}} our brother?' he asked. 'And <b>do</b> <b>you</b> believe it on such evidence as this?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{called me}} a Puritan, and then you quoted that ill-natured French proverb at me. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> your sister thinks evil, Frank?" [...] and as she spoke she put her arm caressingly round his neck.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me more," [...] said Kate, eagerly. [...] "It is all so unreal to me--I {{want to see}} more. Dr. Britt {{has told}} us {{wonderful}} things of you. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> the dead speak to you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I haven't {{called you}} any names, nor do I {{intend to do}} so; I only wanted mother {{to know the truth}} of the {{business}} between us. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> I had any hand in breaking into your store?" ...|$|E
5000|$|So <b>You</b> <b>Really</b> <b>Believe</b> That Love Will Keep You From Getting Hurt? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Whom <b>do</b> <b>you</b> take me for?' {{she exclaimed}} angrily. 'Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> {{that it was}} just for the {{pleasure}} of talking that I gave you the advice you have neglected so abominably?' ...|$|R
5000|$|And if <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> this s*** I'll {{have some}} bridge rubble {{to sell you}} tomorrowBOOM!BOOM!BOOM! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah--your husband--your husband! How strange it seems! I {{remember}} you hinted {{something of the}} sort the other day. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> in these matters, Tess?" [...] he asked. [...] "You seem to have no religion--perhaps owing to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Isabel," [...] I said, {{after it}} was all over, and Mrs. Deering had {{vanished}} in a mist of happy tears, [...] "I suppose {{this is what you}} call perfectly providential. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that Miss Gage didn't send her back?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] he said, [...] "we are in London, {{alone in}} a taxicab, secure against any {{possible}} eavesdropping. You preach the advantage of our Kaiser-led country. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that the Kaiser is the man for the task which is coming?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "‘But mother,’ said I, ‘Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> {{that the}} soul sleeps {{in the grave}} until the resurrection? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> think that the Christian, when he dies, does not go {{immediately}} to heaven, nor the sinner to hell?’ {LS80 170.4} ...|$|R
5000|$|... "But, mother," [...] said I, [...] "do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> {{that the}} soul sleeps {{in the grave}} until the resurrection? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> think that the Christian, when he dies, does not go {{immediately}} to heaven, nor the sinner to hell?" [...] {1T 39.3} ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are an {{even greater}} pessimist than I myself," [...] Norgate observed. [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that the {{position}} is so critical?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In the idiom of this country, Countess," [...] he said, [...] "I {{raise my}} hat to you. You {{preserve}} your mask of ignorance to the end. So much so, indeed, that I find myself asking <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that Germany {{intends to do}} this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|My friends, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> in that kingdom, {{and in that}} King? Do {{you believe}} that you are now {{actually}} in a kingdom of heaven, which cannot be moved; and that the living, acting, guiding, practical, real King thereof is Christ who died on the Cross? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say {{nothing about}} it!" [...] exclaimed Mrs. Cliff. [...] "I wish I had a {{thousand}} tongues {{to talk of}} it. Captain, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that Cheddy man is a priest, or what goes for one in his own country? If he is, he ought to marry you and Edna." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'DO {{you know}} better though?' said Bella. 'Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> <b>you</b> know better? Oh, I should be so glad if <b>you</b> <b>did</b> know better, but I am so very much afraid that I must know best!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> it, Lottie?" [...] Mrs. Kenton entreated, with {{a sudden}} {{tenderness}} for her younger daughter such as she did not always feel.|$|R
6000|$|... "What!" [...] roared McArdle. [...] "You don't {{mean to say}} <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> {{this stuff}} of his about mammoths and mastodons and great sea sairpents?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you expect}} to carry that by going {{out into the streets}} with all the roughs of London, and putting {{yourself}} in direct opposition to the authority of the magistrates? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that the ballot will become {{the law of the land}} any sooner because you incur this danger and inconvenience?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He leant back on {{his hand}} and looked at me, smiling frankly. [...] "Even now," [...] he said, [...] "it's odd, but the whole of {{that seems like a}} silly dream. Do you think there WAS a Lord Warden? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> we sank all that machinery--for fun? It was a dream. And yet--it happened." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, he didn't," [...] {{answered}} the widow, {{for about the}} two hundred and fiftieth time, for there had been occasions when she thought Dorcas put this question inopportunely. [...] "He hated it, and he was drowned in it through trustin' a sailorman, which I never did nor shall. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> those men are comin' here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe,</b> mother, {{that every}} one who is born into the world is sent for a purpose, and with a {{specific}} work to do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{yourself}} for instance?" [...] Isabel suggested jocosely. And then, [...] "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> it will ruin me?" [...] she asked in quite another tone.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>believe</b> that?" [...] Agatha asked, {{with a hint}} of mockery in her voice. [...] "Do {{you imagine}} I have been {{thinking}} about the money?" ...|$|R
