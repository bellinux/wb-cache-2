5|$|In May 2017, {{evidence}} of the earliest known life on land on Earth may {{have been found in}} 3.48-billion-year-old geyserite and other related mineral deposits (often found around hot springs and geysers) uncovered in the Pilbara Craton of Western Australia. These <b>findings</b> <b>may</b> be helpful in deciding where best to search for early signs of life on the planet Mars.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Pulos and Hutt's work, {{researchers}} were {{split on the}} mode of inheritance of white and whether it was deleterious (harmful). Recent research has discovered several possible genetic pathways to a white coat, so disparities in these historical <b>findings</b> <b>may</b> reflect the action of different genes. It {{is also possible that}} the varied origins of Pulos and Hutt's white horses might be responsible for the lack of homozygotes. Therefore, it remains to be proven whether all equine dominant white mutations cause embryonic lethality in the homozygous state.|$|E
5|$|In years since, {{signatures}} of water {{have been found}} to exist on the lunar surface. In 1994, the bistatic radar experiment located on the Clementine spacecraft, indicated the existence of small, frozen pockets of water close to the surface. However, later radar observations by Arecibo, suggest these <b>findings</b> <b>may</b> rather be rocks ejected from young impact craters. In 1998, the neutron spectrometer on the Lunar Prospector spacecraft showed that high concentrations of hydrogen are present in the first meter of depth in the regolith near the polar regions. Volcanic lava beads, brought back to Earth aboard Apollo 15, showed small amounts of water in their interior.|$|E

5|$|On 8 September 1994 the DoD {{announced}} the actions {{it would take}} {{in response to the}} investigation's <b>findings.</b> <b>May</b> was charged with 26 counts of negligent homicide by military legal authorities. Martin, Tracy, Wang, Halcli, and Wilson were charged with dereliction of duty. All of those charged faced an Article 32 hearing in which it would be decided if they should be tried by court-martial or the matter disposed of otherwise. Martin, Tracy, Wang, Halcli, and Wilson faced a joint Article 32 hearing while May's hearing was separate. Wickson was not charged. Although not explicitly stated by USAF leaders, it appears that Wickson was not charged but May was because Wickson had testified that he was sure of his identification of the two Black Hawks as hostile Hinds, while May had stated that he was not sure of Wickson's identification but had allowed the engagement to proceed anyway.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{findings}} {{in people with}} tension pneumothorax are chest pain and respiratory distress, often with an increased heart rate (tachycardia) and rapid breathing (tachypnea) in the initial stages. Other <b>findings</b> <b>may</b> include quieter breath sounds {{on one side of}} the chest, low oxygen levels and blood pressure, and displacement of the trachea away from the affected side. Rarely, there may be cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin due to low oxygen levels), altered level of consciousness, a hyperresonant percussion note on examination of the affected side with reduced expansion and decreased movement, pain in the epigastrium (upper abdomen), displacement of the apex beat (heart impulse), and resonant sound when tapping the sternum. This is a medical emergency and may require immediate treatment without further investigations (see below).|$|E

25|$|A MRI using flow {{parameters}} and an MR venogram {{are more sensitive}} than a CT scan, and are the imaging studies of choice to diagnose cavernous sinus thrombosis. <b>Findings</b> <b>may</b> include deformity of the internal carotid artery within the cavernous sinus, and an obvious signal hyperintensity within thrombosed vascular sinuses on all pulse sequences.|$|E
30|$|Our <b>finding</b> <b>may</b> {{prove to}} be {{clinically}} useful, because CSF HMGB 1 ELISA can be performed in almost all clinical laboratories, especially when sophisticated technologies are either time consuming or unavailable.|$|R

25|$|Methods of {{diagnosis}} in HCC have evolved with {{the improvement in}} medical imaging. The evaluation of both asymptomatic patients and those with symptoms of liver disease involves blood testing and imaging evaluation. Although historically a biopsy of the tumor was required to prove the diagnosis, imaging (especially MRI) <b>findings</b> <b>may</b> be conclusive enough to obviate histopathologic confirmation.|$|E
25|$|One {{disease that}} may be {{difficult}} to exclude in the differential diagnosis is involvement of the facial nerve in infections with the herpes zoster virus. The major differences in this condition are the presence of small blisters, or vesicles, on the external ear and hearing disturbances, but these <b>findings</b> <b>may</b> occasionally be lacking (zoster sine herpete). Reactivation of existing herpes zoster infection leading to facial paralysis in a Bell's palsy type pattern is known as Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2.|$|E
25|$|Oscillatory rhythms at 10Hz {{have been}} {{recorded}} in a brain area called the inferior olive, which {{is associated with the}} cerebellum. These oscillations are also observed in motor output of physiological tremor and when performing slow finger movements. These <b>findings</b> <b>may</b> indicate that the human brain controls continuous movements intermittently. In support, it was shown that these movement discontinuities are directly correlated to oscillatory activity in a cerebello-thalamo-cortical loop, which may represent a neural mechanism for the intermittent motor control.|$|E
30|$|DPL [30] should {{theoretically}} better reflect lung stress than DPrs [31]. DPL decreased {{significantly in}} PP with no effect of PEEP strategy. Therefore, this <b>finding</b> <b>may</b> {{contribute to the}} better outcome of patients treated in PP.|$|R

30|$|In addition, {{from our}} finding, {{miniaturized}} MFC performs better at an elevated temperature, which concurs with {{the trend of}} macro-sized MFCs [36]. This <b>finding</b> <b>may</b> help our future MFC design to seek for optimal temperature to be established.|$|R
25|$|In a 2004 {{prospective}} {{cohort study}} on colon cancer {{risk associated with}} CRP levels, people with colon cancer had higher average CRP concentrations than people without colon cancer. It can {{be noted that the}} average CRP levels in both groups were well within the range of CRP levels usually found in healthy people. However, these <b>findings</b> <b>may</b> suggest that low inflammation level can be associated with a lower risk of colon cancer, concurring with previous studies that indicate anti-inflammatory drugs could lower colon cancer risk.|$|E
25|$|These <b>findings</b> <b>may</b> {{be useful}} for {{aligning}} Schwann cells in a nervous system injury to promote the formation of bands of Bungner, which are crucial for maintaining the endoneurial tube that guides the regrowing axons back to their targets. It {{is nearly impossible to}} align Schwann cells by external physical techniques; thus, the discovery of an alternative technique for alignment is significant. However, the technique developed still has its disadvantages, namely that it takes a considerable amount of energy to sustain the magnetic field for extended periods.|$|E
25|$|Conversely, it {{has also}} been {{reported}} that there is at times, no difference within the left prefrontal cortex when comparing word generation in early bilinguals and late bilinguals. It has been reported that these <b>findings</b> <b>may</b> conflict with those stated above because of different levels of proficiency in each language. That is, an individual who resides in a bilingual society {{is more likely to be}} highly proficient in both languages, as opposed to a bilingual individual who lives in a dominantly monolingual community. Thus, language proficiency is another factor affecting the neuronal organization of language processing in bilinguals.|$|E

25|$|The {{study of}} {{materials}} science {{is an important}} ISS research activity, {{with the objective of}} reaping economic benefits through the improvement of techniques used on the ground. Other areas of interest include the effect of the low gravity environment on combustion, through the study of the efficiency of burning and control of emissions and pollutants. These <b>findings</b> <b>may</b> improve current knowledge about energy production, and lead to economic and environmental benefits. Future plans are for the researchers aboard the ISS to examine aerosols, ozone, water vapour, and oxides in Earth's atmosphere, as well as cosmic rays, cosmic dust, antimatter, and dark matter in the universe.|$|E
25|$|In human studies, testosterone-aggression {{research}} has also focused {{on the role of}} the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). This brain area is strongly associated with impulse control and self-regulation systems that integrate emotion, motivation, and cognition to guide context-appropriate behavior. Patients with localized lesions to the OFC engage in heightened reactive aggression. Aggressive behavior may be regulated by testosterone via reduced medial OFC engagement following social provocation. When measuring participants' salivary testosterone, higher levels can predict subsequent aggressive behavioral reactions to unfairness faced during a task. Moreover, brain scanning with fMRI shows reduced activity in the medial OFC during such reactions. Such <b>findings</b> <b>may</b> suggest that a specific brain region, the OFC, is a key factor in understanding reactive aggression.|$|E
25|$|These {{important}} scientific <b>findings</b> <b>may</b> {{begin to}} shift the neuron-specific perspective into a more holistic view of the brain which encompasses the glial cells as well. The glia's importance is becoming ever more clear {{as time goes on}} and new research is conducted. For the vast part of the last century, scientists have written off glial cells to be nothing more than the structure and foundations that hold the neurons in place. But now, there is direct evidence that correlates the number of glial cells in the brain with the amount of intelligence that any given species possesses. Future research will begin to shed light on the mysterious, yet increasingly crucial, role of glial cells.|$|E
