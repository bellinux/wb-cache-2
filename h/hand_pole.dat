50|$|The {{pressure}} gradient in an ultrasonic wave moves particles {{relative to the}} fluid. This motion disturbs the double layer that exists at the particle-fluid interface. The picture illustrates the mechanism of this distortion. Practically all particles in fluids carry a surface charge. This surface charge is screened with an equally charged diffuse layer; this structure is called the double layer. Ions of the diffuse layer {{are located in the}} fluid and can move with the fluid. Fluid motion relative to the particle drags these diffuse ions in the direction of {{one or the other of}} the particle's poles. The picture shows ions dragged towards the left <b>hand</b> <b>pole.</b> As a result of this drag, there is an excess of negative ions in the vicinity of the left <b>hand</b> <b>pole</b> and an excess of positive surface charge at the right <b>hand</b> <b>pole.</b> As a result of this charge excess, particles gain a dipole moment. These dipole moments generate an electric field that in turn generates measurable electric current. This phenomenon is widely used for measuring zeta potential in concentrated colloids.|$|E
5000|$|In 1555, Queen Mary began {{permitting}} {{the burning of}} Anglicans for heresy, and some 220 men and 60 women were executed before her death in 1558. Pole shares responsibility for these persecutions which, despite his intention, contributed to the ultimate victory of the English Reformation. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>Pole</b> was in failing health during the worst period of persecution, {{and there is some}} evidence that he favoured a more lenient approach: [...] "Three condemned heretics from Bonner's diocese were pardoned on an appeal to him; he merely enjoined a penance and gave them absolution." [...] As the reign wore on, an increasing number of people turned against Mary and her government, and some people who had been indifferent to the English Reformation began turning against Catholicism. Writings such as John Foxe's 1568 Book of Martyrs, which emphasised the sufferings of the reformers under Mary, helped shape popular opinion against Catholicism in England for generations.|$|E
50|$|The shrine {{itself is}} only partly {{preserved}} {{but there is}} {{enough to be able}} to identify it as, not the Amon shrine of Psamtik I which was to be expected, but rather as the Amon shrine of Taharqa, whose prenomen < N5-nfr-U15-Aa1-A >Nfrtm-ḫw-R, preceded by < R8-nfr-V30-N16:N17 > ("Beautiful God, Lord of the Two Lands"), is to be found in the vertical inscription on its left. It is within a baldachin, the left <b>hand</b> <b>pole</b> of which is banded in yellow-red-yellow-blue sequence and is held by a small royal figure with single uraeus, kneeling on the base which projects slightly beyond the pole. A fragment of the right end of the base is preserved and this, with the fragment of the shrine, attests the original width of shrine and baldachin together. Just enough of the top of the baldachin is preserved to demonstrate that, as usual, its front is higher than its back. The shrine also has a frieze of uraei across the top and registers between vertical columns of hieroglyphs which name the king. Under a sky with stars the upper reister has figures of Ma'at with outstretched protective wings guarding the ram-headed figure of Amon. Between the wings od Ma'at and on either side of Amon two royal figures offer the wadjet-eye. Herihor's shrine has a central register lacking in Taharqa's. The lower in both has hawk-headed Souls of Pe making jubilation. Herihor's shrine has four, flanked by the Singers of Upper and Lower Egypt. How many were on Taharqua's shrine is uncertain.|$|E

40|$|A cross {{sectional}} {{study was conducted}} to analyze a relationship between bogie locations and the ride performance in a monorail car. This study was carried out t* determine exposure levels of whole body vibration in a certain location in a monorail car and related to various condition path of the beam. Human Vibration Meter (HWl) 100 Larson Davis and Whole Body Vibration (WBV) sensor as a device were used to measure at 2 positions within 3 locations inside a monorail car and 3 different paths of beams. The measurement of whole body vibration was done on a consumer monorail in operation and service during off peak hour. The data in the form magnitude collected and recorded by HVM 100 was transferred to the computer using Blaze software. The analysis of graph pattern and the difference of magnitude value for each location inside a car was studied to determine the exposure level of vibration. Data was evaluated and the results show high magnitude vibration for all / three axes x, y, z which are 6. 92 &st, 4. 61 m/s 2, and 3. 9 m/s 2 respectively, The Vibration Calculator was used to calculate the risk of WBV in the daily vibration exposure that a passenger is subjected to comply health and safety requirements. The finding showed there are relations between bogie location and vibration exposure, which resulted over the allowable exposure limit value 1. 15 m/s 2. The individual subjected to frequently vibration exposure would tend to receive higher rate transmission of vibration in the body and will cause health problem. Among the improvements suggested reducing the vibration such as by putting the seat with a cushion, rubber padding on the floor, and installing more <b>hand</b> <b>pole</b> {{at the center of the}} car...|$|E

40|$|Many {{economists have}} not disputed aggressively ‘competition’ itself. However a few experts {{have had their}} own visions of ‘competition and rivalry’.

In the ‘process of competition and rivalry’allocated in reverse order there are four requirements and five nodes. Though the firm has larger or smaller power of pricing formation, his budget constraint is apt to be relatively soft or to be relatively hard. The cost−plus principle prevails as a universal experienced rule. Does our process of competition and rivalry converge to the type of the flexible price formation again? In the dynamic process of competition and rivalry the combined values, namely, c, g, m and s give vital effects to the firm’s technical innovation and his efficiency sooner or later. The government’s public policies including deregulation can control the producer’s surplus especially in that process observing the firm’s values.

50|$|Sure-footedness is {{something}} that one can be trained in to a certain extent, especially through regular, strenuous exercise in steep, rough terrain that is not exposed.
