40|$|Abstract: Door stiness {{is one of}} the {{important}} factors in side impact. A side <b>door</b> <b>beam</b> is installed in the door to protect occupants from side impact. Generally, side impact performance has been calculated with the assembled door unit or the body-in-white (BIW) system. Thus, the eects of a side <b>door</b> <b>beam</b> should be investigated after a BIW system is designed. This research concentrates on the side <b>door</b> <b>beam,</b> which will be optimized. The cross-section of a side <b>door</b> <b>beam</b> is dened to have an elliptic shape. An optimization problem is formulated to nd the design maximizing the crush stiness within the specied weight. Design variables are the radii and the thickness of the side <b>door</b> <b>beam</b> with the elliptic section. Analysis of the side impact is carried out by the non-linear nite element method. The optimization problem is solved by two methods. One is the experimental design scheme using an orthogonal array. The other is optimization using the response surface method (RSM). Both methods have obtained better designs than the current one...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The <b>door</b> <b>beam</b> {{inside the}} car door is an key {{component}} to improve the security of passengers, most great automobile manufacturing companies use ultra-high strength steel plate to manufacture it，however, {{it is very difficult}} to form in room temperature，so commonly it is made by hot stamping but the cost is too high. This article gives a solution to deal with this problem by the use of FEM software in simulating and optimizing the forming process of one kind of ultra-high strength steel <b>door</b> <b>beam</b> in room temperature, and main study is in the influence of temperature on internal organization changes of the ultra-high strength sheet and springback by comparing the simulation result and real sample, and meanwhile convex roofs are added in the addendum to optimize the surface. It is helpful on how to design die face in manufacturing the related ultra-high strength steel parts...|$|E

40|$|Structural {{optimization}} {{related to}} crashworthiness and energy absorption capability is particularly {{importance to the}} automotive industry. The optimization involves highly nonlinear computational analysis and design with many material and structure parameters. This paper presents a crashworthiness design of the circular side <b>door</b> <b>beam</b> which attach to the side door structures. The response surface method (RSM) is utilized to formulate the complex crashworthiness design problem {{in the case of}} optimization. In this study, side <b>door</b> <b>beam</b> will be optimized. The beams in circular shape were studied and compared. The focus is on finding an optimum cross-section shape of the beam in order to improve the energy absorption character.  An optimization problem is formulated to find the maximum energy absorbed with the maximum peak load as a constraint, the shape of the beam cross section and the thickness as variable. The structure optimum design and simulation analysis of automobile side-door beam was carried out by using Finite Element (FE) method...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} presents six simultaneous innovative occupant {{near side}} lateral impact protection concepts including a dynamic door, high-volume side airbag, a large external airbag that covers doors, sill and B-pillar of the struck vehicle and other concepts {{for increasing the}} distance between the occupant and the door panel (active armrest, inflatable <b>door</b> <b>beam</b> and moving seat). All systems are based on pre crash detection of the impact and are activated as soon as 80 ms before the impact. This paper details the task of integrating these systems into a vehicle using FE models, sled tests, and full scale crash tests. Sled test dummy responses were compared with and without the countermeasures. Postprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|Euro NCAP {{continually}} examines and modifies its protocols {{to encourage}} the automotive industry to improve vehicles {{and the safety of}} occupants. The aim {{of this study is to}} identify the key differences between the past and current Euro NCAP protocols regarding side impact, in order to apply optimized countermeasures for fulfilling the new requirements in a previously designed vehicle. Outcomes from a possible Euro NCAP increase in crash speed from 50 km/h to 60 km/h were evaluated. The current protocol introduces the dummy WorldSID 50 th percentile and changes in the barrier. The changes in the dummy lead to a reduction in the distance between the occupant and the door panel, and the current geometry of the barrier causes the car’s structure, in particular the sill, to be additionally loaded. An increase in mass of the current barrier causes an increase in energy absorption, thus presenting different deformation patterns. With the updated protocol, the most critical anatomical areas observed in this research were the pelvis and the shoulder. Countermeasures in this study were especially focused on decreasing the load on these anatomical structures. The evaluated countermeasures were: - Sill and B-pillar geometric adaptation to better perform against the AE-MDB - Reduced stiffness of the door panel at the occupant impact location - Optimized <b>door</b> <b>beam</b> Finite Element Method (FEM) tools were used as the basis of this research, including validated and correlated models with experimental full car tests. Initially, the research started with FEM testing of the current vehicle according to both past and current Euro NCAP protocols. Pelvic biomechanical values reached the lower performance limits when testing the AE-MDB barrier at 50 km/h. This new test has an especial impact in midsized cars in terms of pelvis loading, leading the pubic and sacroiliac forces to increase in 38. 6...|$|E

The effects of this testing resulted in softened front end contours, removal of drip troughs and helped shaped internal air flow ducting. Body engineering in the Aspen was executed using computer technology; unit body engineering was conducted by use of clear plastic stress models that showed up stress points before any sheet metal was formed. Weight reduction to provide maximum fuel economy was achieved through use of thinner glass, lighter weight side <b>door</b> <b>beams</b> and HSLA brackets and reinforcements that were four times as strong as conventional mild steel. A reduced number of stampings resulted in better panel fits and fewer welds.
