In this research, a prototype of thermoelectric generator is developed in order to supply the ICCP system. This thermoelectric generator is planned to utilize the exhaust gas from main engine of the ship. Method carried in this research is assembling the prototype of thermoelectric generator followed by conducted experiment to observe the potential energy of the prototype. After that, the required number of thermoelectric generator is calculated to supply the ICCP system to protect the ship from corrosion. The object in this research is live <b>fish</b> <b>carrier</b> “Wellboat” which has 396. 08 m 2 wetted area.

40|$|Lymphocystis disease (LCD) is {{the main}} viral {{infection}} reported to affect cultured gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) in Southern Atlantic and Mediterranean aquaculture. Its etiological agent is the Lymphocystis disease virus (LCDV), {{a member of the}} family Iridoviridae (genus Lymphocystivirus). The only adequate measures for LCD prevention in the aquaculture systems are general prophylactic practices, such as the control of fish to be introduced in the farm facilities in order to detect carrier fish. These animals may pose a risk for the introduction of LCDV in fish farms, as direct contact between fish specimens is considered the main route of LCDV spreading. More recently, asymptomatic carrier breeders, as well as virus contaminated-live food, have been involved in LCDV transmission to fish larvae. The detection of subclinical viral infections in carrier fish requires the use of sensitive diagnostic methods. In this context, the objective of this study was to establish the applicability of a real-time PCR assay for LCDV diagnosis in surveillance studies. In addition, the assay has been evaluated with samples from a gilthead seabream hatchery, in order to prove its utility to trace the origin of LCDV in fish farms. Juvenile fish were collected at four farms with different background regarding to LCD. LCDV was detected in all farms, and 30 to 100 % of fish were identified as LCDV-infected. Estimated viral load in caudal fin of asymptomatic fish was two to five orders of magnitude lower than in diseased <b>fish.</b> <b>Carrier</b> fish were also identified in the broodstock from a farm with LCD records by analysing caudal fin samples by qPCR. In this farm, the q-PCR assay developed in this study allowed the quantitative detection of LCDV in all samples collected in the hatchery, including fertilized eggs, larvae and fingerlings, and also rotifer cultures and artemia metanauplii and cysts used for larval rearing.

40|$|The {{condition}} of {{a fishing boat}} is very different between her departure and arrival, i. e., between outward and homeward voyage, during fishing operation, before and after transshipping of fish from catching boat to <b>fish</b> <b>carrier,</b> and therefore her motions are also different. This paper deals with the rolling, pitching and heaving motions of the response oscillation of the ship under various sea conditions. A series of field measurements were carried out on board three bull trawlers (No. 97 Choyo Maru, Nos. 23 and 51 Tokai Maru; 140 G. T.). The variation of each oscillation was recorded continuously for about 12 minutes in the 4 channel data recorder, while the sea conditions were observed by naked-eyes. The characters of oscillation such as rolling, pitching and vertical accelerations were obtained by the method of statistical analysis of the stochastic processes. Accordingly, the several substantial results are: 1) Although {{it is assumed that}} measured values of respective rolling, pitching and heaving motions under a certain sea condition are much the same, different values were observed. For instance, the rolling values in the bow sea under the pitching values in the head sea fluctuated under same sea condition. 2) During a fishing operation period (about 3 hours) the change of three motions is very small. 3) The rolling and heaving motions of the fishing boat in the fishing operation are greater than those in the voyage. However, the pitching is less conversely. 4) The author found a comfort index from the result of the measurment of vertical acceleration. The greater is the comfort index, the comfort becomes worse. The comfort, based on the comfort index, {{is the best in the}} fishing commander's bed and then in wireless operater's bed. There is a tendency that the comfort becomes worse in proportion tothe distance from the center of the ship. 以西底曳網漁船の実船試験によって,Rolling, Pitchingおよび上下加速度についての統計的動揺特性は次の通りであった。 1. 目視観測による海況階級が等しく,波と船との各出合い角度別の 3 運動の動揺特性は,Head seaのとき, 2 回の計測結果ではRollingとHeavingは周期,振巾共に相違はないがPitchingは,周期は等しいが振巾は異なった。Bow seaのときは,Rollingの振巾が 3 回の計測で各々異なった値を示した。Beam seaのときは, 3 回の計測結果が 3 運動共に相違は少なかった。スペクトラムからPitchingにはRollingの固有周期が表われる。またHeavingのスペクトラムにはPitchingのスペクトラムの変動分がRollingのそれより多く含まれている。 2. 約 2 時間 30 分の一曳網中における 3 運動の動揺特性には時間の経過に伴なう変化は認められない。従って魚の入網効果による運動の変化は無視できる。 3. 操業中と航海中との運動の平均振巾値の比較は,Quartering seaの場合,RollingとHeavingは操業中の方が大きくPitchingはわずかながら航海中の方が大であった。 4. 船の乗心地指標を乗組員の各寝台で計測された上下加速度をもって比較した場合,最も良好であったのは船橋の漁撈長の寝台で,次いで通信長および船長の寝台であった。一般乗組員の寝台問では明らかな順序はつけ難いが船首に近い程悪い傾向が認められる...|$|E
40|$|The Live <b>Fish</b> <b>Carrier</b> Industry is a {{specialized}} shipping segment in Norway, transporting and processing live salmon. The underlying driver for the segment is {{the production of}} salmon in aquaculture. With an absence of academic research on the topic, this thesis will try to fuse the attention from the academic society. By modeling the supply and demand of LFC operations, we observe a surplus on the demand side of the market. A turning point occurred in 2013 when the supply increased more than the demand. New, large and expensive vessels entered the market, and substantial capacity will enter in 2017. This will eliminate the demand surplus, and create a movement towards market balance. The operations of the vessels are managed by the salmon producers. Our positional tracking analysis indicates that the vessels are not utilized efficiently. The vessels are operating across a large range of regions, within a six-month period. The analysis provides grounds for an argument that large vessels, individually, are covering fewer regions than the smaller vessels. The smaller vessels are unlikely to capture long charter contracts, and consequently have to move more between regions. This operational pattern is a reason for concern, when the risk of spreading diseases is high. There are several reasons {{to operate in the}} LFC industry. From a salmon producer’s perspective, we believe that the supplied services can be looked upon as an insurance from random shocks of lice and diseases on the biomass. The value of an average cage has increased with 400 % the last ten years, which consequently will increase the value of having excess LFC-capacity. From our analysis based on the Return on Shipping Investments model, the average financial return is 12. 6 %. We conducted a freight rate sensitivity analysis to assess the effect on NPV of a new LFC investments.

40|$|Due to {{overcapacity}} in the Norwegian purse seiner/trawler fleet, {{statistics show}} that the vessels have been idle {{for an average of}} 192 days each, the period 2006 - 2012. As the vessels and crew are highly regarded in shipping for their qualities and skills, there has been a increasing trend of the use of purse seiner/trawlers in unconventional operations. Despite the increasing trend, the vessel design has not been radically changed to fit the purpose. In this thesis, this trend was studied with the purpose of developing a design optimized for utilizing the vessels in off-season. The thesis investigates four additional markets, for which the requirements and challenges by hiring a purse seiner/trawler have been evaluated. The method used to compare the alternatives is by weighted grading with parameters such as profitability, regulations and technical implementation complexity. The four market segments were PSV, oil recovery, survey, research and live <b>fish</b> <b>carriers.</b> The evaluation of the markets showed that a purse seiner/trawler was most feasible to be combined with survey operations, and secondly research. The two scored satisfactorily in terms of technical implementation as well as regulation requirements, while survey surpassed research in terms of profitability. Due to the similarities in the research and survey vessel segments, the segments were merged into one {{for the development of a}} concept design to increase the size of the potential market, and thus increase the opportunities for charters. Further on, a concept design was developed for a purse seiner/trawler to be utilized in research and survey operations during off-season. This included establishing design criteria, by the basis of the state of the art as well as regulatory requirements and interviews from relevant market players. The concept vessel was designed with an increased cabin capacity, deck area and multi-purpose spaces dedicated for research/survey use. Additionally, a false keel was installed as well as transverse thrusters to increase the dynamic positioning capability and attain the DP 1 certification. The vessel will also need to obtain certification as a cargo vessel, including load line certification. An evaluation of the concept design versus the state of the art indicates that it will not enable all functionality of the research and survey vessels, although it will increase the functionality compared to the existing purse seiner/trawlers engaged in such operations. This is enabled through a more flexible deck arrangement, increased cabin capacity and larger dynamic positioning capabilities. Still, it is recommended that an investment study is done to incorporate the capital expenditure and operating cost in the decision making analysis, caused by the additional steel and equipment due to the off-seasonal utilization. </p...|$|R

All bacterial isolates were submitted to identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing using aminopenicillin, beta-lactamase inhibitors, carbapenem, 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd and 4 th generation cephalosporins, and monobactam. Three types of beta-lactamases - ESBL, AmpC and KPC - were investigated. 103 strains were identified, and the most frequent species in shrimp and fish samples was Enterobacter cloacae (n = 54). All the strains were resistant to penicillin and more than 50 % of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin and cephalothin. Resistance to three 3 rd generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime) and one fourth generation cephalosporin (cefepime) was detected in two isolates of E. cloacae from shrimp samples.

Interactions between bacteria and parasites were studied using grayling subjected to concomitant exposure to aAS bacteria and the digenean parasite Diplostomum spathaceum. Atypical AS was detected from fish {{by a combination of}} bacterial cultivation and polymerase chain reaction techniques. A detection level of 17 aAS cells per 100 ?mg intestine tissue sample was obtained. Concomitant bacterial exposure did not enhance the severity of grayling eye rupture and nuclear extrusion induced by D. spathaceum, but D. spathaceum invasion into grayling increased the proportion of fish carrying aAS in their heart tissue. However, the number of aAS cells detected in heart tissue was low. Atypical AS did not cause acute disease or mortality during 15 ?days post-exposure. There was a higher prevalence of aAS in grayling heart samples than in intestinal samples, indicating that the intestine is not favoured by aAS.

Paradoxically, BRCA 1 deficiency in mice results in early embryonic lethality, and similarly, lack of BRCA 1 in human cells {{is thought to}} result in cellular lethality in view of BRCA 1 's essential function. To survive homozygous BRCA 1 inactivation during tumorigenesis, precancerous cells must accumulate additional genetic alterations, such as p 53 mutations, but this requirement for an extra genetic “hit” contradicts the two-hit theory for the accelerated carcinogenesis associated with familial cancer syndromes. Here, we show that heterozygous BRCA 1 inactivation results in genomic instability in nontumorigenic human breast epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo.

The reference strain of SaHV- 1 is Herpesvirus salmonis and SaHV- 2 is Oncorhynchus masou virus (OMV) strain OO- 7812. OMV disease (OMVD) causes oncogenic and skin ulcer conditions. The main susceptible fish species are kokanee salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), masu salmon (O. masou), coho salmon (O. kisutch) and rainbow trout (O. mykiss).

In this study, the analytical and diagnostic performance of an alternative serum neutralization (SN) method based on the detection of CyHV- 3 -specific antibodies was assessed using 151 serum or plasma samples from healthy and naturally or experimentally CyHV- 3 -infected carp. French CyHV- 3 isolate 07 / 108 b was neutralized efficiently by sera from carp infected with European, American and Taiwanese CyHV- 3 isolates, but no neutralization was observed using sera specific to other aquatic herpesviruses.

40|$|We {{report on}} a {{familial}} case including four male probands from three generations with a 45,X,psu dic(15;Y) (p 11. 2;q 12) karyotype. 45,X is usually associated with a female phenotype and only rarely with maleness, due to translocation of small Y chromosomal fragments to autosomes. These male patients are commonly infertile because of missing azoospermia factor regions from the Y long arm. In our familial case we found a pseudodicentric translocation chromosome, that contains almost the entire chromosomes 15 and Y. The translocation took place in an unknown male ancestor of our probands and has no apparent effect on fertility and phenotype of the <b>carrier.</b> <b>FISH</b> analysis demonstrated the deletion of the pseudoautosomal region 2 (PAR 2) from the Y chromosome {{and the loss of}} the nucleolus organizing region (NOR) from chromosome 15.
