500|$|Just Good Old Rock and Roll is {{much more}} {{straightforward}} than past works, consisting of funk-influenced hard rock, although [...] "So Many People to Tell" [...] and [...] "Silver Passion Mine" [...] also exhibit a late-psychedelic sound. As Whetstone explains, [...] "We were fairly naive in terms of guidance; we had none, so we were experimenting {{with a lot of}} musical styles. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> the album, you'll hear a lot of diversity, feel and tempo changes...That was our learning curve." [...] In early 1970, Whetstone and Wade departed the band and moved to Canada where they formed Stallion Thumbrock. Morgan and Kincaid constructed another line-up of The Electric Prunes that included Michael Kearns, Clay Groomer, Huey Plumeigh, and Galen Pugh; however, by mid-1970 the band dissolved.|$|E
500|$|In the band, Joseph {{covered a}} lot of the {{keyboard}} parts that Yanni could not for lack of hands in the shows. He assisted with the task of managing the 30 or more synthesizers onstage, and helped layer with the orchestra to create a [...] "full-bodied, live-effect sound". [...] He did have to adjust some parts that did not work well in a live situation and worked extensively on programming sounds for all keyboardists. [...] Joseph said that [...] "Yanni gave us musicians a great deal of freedom to expand the music as well. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> the original recordings he did and what we ended up with in our live recordings, you can really hear the musician's input." [...] He readily credits Yanni's role in his professional development, and for five years of irreplaceable experiences and memories.|$|E

500|$|... "Monster" [...] {{was written}} by Lady Gaga, RedOne and Space Cowboy, with RedOne {{producing}} the track. The song was recorded at the Record Plant Studio in Los Angeles. In an interview with MTV News, Gaga said that [...] "Monster" [...] describes her fear of sex and relationships and the literal meaning is about a [...] "guy with a big dick". She elaborated, [...] "It's the fear of attachment {{and the fear of}} loving something that's bad for you... <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> the lyrics, it's like being in love with the bad boy all the time, and you keep going back for more." [...] Gaga added that the fear in [...] "Monster" [...] erupted from her need to have a stable relationship. [...] "I keep falling in love with the monster... But what I really need is the security and the safety and the womanhood, responsibility of my femininity. And so that's what that song is about.|$|E
500|$|Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called [...] "Alive" [...] the [...] "biggest surprise" [...] of J to tha L–O! The Remixes. William Ruhlmann of Allmusic {{gave the}} song a {{negative}} review, writing that her vocal limitations [...] "come {{to the fore}} when she is spotlighted on such a song without a dance arrangement to support her". He stated, however, that her vocal limitations are not [...] "as big a deal" [...] as her lack of emotional involvement: [...] "Though she tries to fake it here and there, she still sounds like she's singing her grocery list instead of the song's clichéd lyrics". David Browne of Entertainment Weekly called the song a [...] "syrupy ballad" [...] that is [...] "neither alive nor a remix". He stated that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> the song long enough, [...] "you may actually be conned into thinking Lopez's voice and songs are passable". He concluded by stating {{as a result of}} [...] "Alive", J to tha L–O! The Remixes may be the most insidious album ever made.|$|E
500|$|... "Get On Top", a song which {{contains}} significant {{use of a}} wah pedal, was formed after a jam session conducted shortly after Frusciante had listened to Public Enemy: [...] "I came up with [...] {{on the way to}} rehearsal—just tapping it out with my foot." [...] The understated guitar solo played {{in the middle of the}} song was originally intended to be more noticeable, according to Frusciante, who was playing screaming guitar solos. He changed his thought process after listening to Steve Howe's guitar solo on Yes' [...] "Siberian Khatru": [...] "the band sounded really big—and they're playing really fast—and then this clean guitar solo comes out over on top. It's really beautiful, like it's on its own sort of shelf. For 'Get On Top' I wanted to play something that contrasted between the solo and the background." [...] "Savior", a song found towards the end of the album, features heavy effects, most notably an Electro-Harmonix Micro Synth with 16-second delay. Frusciante notes that the sound is [...] "directly inspired by Eric Clapton's playing in Cream. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> the actual notes, they're like a Clapton solo—they just don't sound like it because of the effects." ...|$|E

Tony Guidi of TeamXbox {{also noted that the}} character voices were [...] "done well" [...] and that the music [...] "isn't annoying". However, Michael Lafferty of GameZone stated that the music can become [...] "a little tiring" [...] and [...] "annoying" [...] after a while. Ryan Davis of GameSpot concluded that the sound was [...] "respectable", but added that the [...] "attitude" [...] of the character sounds bites seemed [...] "forced". Ed Lewis of IGN {{said that the}} [...] "saving grace" [...] of the [...] "Looney Tunes-style repartee and sound effects" [...] is that [...] "it was done professionally and while it's pretty silly <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> it, it doesn't grate and get under the skin as other games can." [...] He added that the music was [...] "bouncy and peppy and, once again, cartoony". Steven Rodriguez of Nintendo World Report described the music and sound effects as [...] "generic" [...] and [...] "plain" [...] respectively, and noted that {{the best part of the}} game's audio was [...] "that sexy talking mask that gives you advice between races, but even he gets rather annoying." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2009, co-writer and {{producer}} of the song, Xavier [...] "Zaytoven" [...] Dotson revealed to MTV News that he worked with Usher on a song. Zaytoven divulged a few details, saying, [...] "I can't wait for {{something like that to}} come out, so people can see I do more than just hip-hop. I can do R, pop, gospel ... whatever genre of music that's out. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> , you can't say, 'Zaytoven did that.'" [...] According to Zaytoven in another interview with MTV News, the track was originally called [...] "Filing Papers". Zaytoven said, [...] "This is before there were any reports about Usher's marriage in the news. So I was thinking to myself, 'Is he trying to say something?' I don't know what Usher is going through, but Sean Garrett made a song about filling out papers, divorce papers. The beat, it's got a bounce to it. It's outta here." [...] Sean Garrett later clarified, stating that the song was not necessarily called [...] "Filing Papers", Garret commented, [...] "Let's say I wrote a record for Usher three or four months ago where I really didn't have any idea of what he was going through personally. I work really hard at creating records I feel that's gonna fit like a glove to an artist. Me and Usher have a close relationship; I tend to sort of assist certain artists in giving them a direction, where I think they need to go in their next move. I felt that was the direction we needed to go. I felt that was the question everyone wanted to know: Was [...] good or was it bad? Was it right? Are you happy or you're not?" [...] Garrett continued to maintain that he had no idea of Usher's state of marriage {{during the time of the}} song's development, stating that the record could have meant anything, saying, [...] "I'm a heavy believer in God. I'm a Pisces. My intuition is crazy. I think that's healthy in the process for me writing and producing for people. Maybe it was a sign of what my man was going through and he needed to get out. Maybe it was something she needed to hear as a wake-up call to her." ...|$|E
2500|$|They were voted No.52 on VH1's [...] "100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock". [...] The band is {{credited}} for inventing the alternative metal genre {{which began in}} the 1980s and that fuses metal with other genres, including alternative rock. Tim Grierson of About.com said the band [...] "helped put alternative metal on the map." [...] Faith No More has also been credited for influencing nu metal bands, such as Limp Bizkit, Korn, and Sevendust, primarily due to the popularity of [...] "Epic", and other early material that featured rap and rock crossovers. Papa Roach vocalist Jacoby Shaddix, a self-confessed fan of the band, stated in a 2015 interview [...] "They fused some of that hip-hop and rock together. They were one of the earliest bands to do that, and definitely pioneers to a whole genre. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> Korn, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> how the bass and the drums lock up, it's quite similar to how Faith No More was doing it in their early years." ...|$|E

2500|$|Of his double-talk routines, Carl Reiner said, [...] "His {{ability to}} doubletalk every {{language}} {{known to man}} was impeccable," [...] and during one performance Caesar imitated four different languages but with almost no real words. Despite his apparent fluency in many languages, Caesar could actually speak only English and Yiddish. In 2008, Caesar told a USA Today reporter, [...] "Every language has its own music ... <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> a language for 15 minutes, you know the rhythm and song." [...] Having developed this mimicry skill, he could create entire monologues using gibberish in numerous languages, {{as he did in}} a skit in which he played a German general.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, {{there seems}} to be bands that appear to be more lighthearted and less {{concerned}} over being described as deathcore. Scott Lewis of the San Diego-based deathcore band Carnifex started [...] "We're not one of those bands trying to escape the banner of deathcore. I know a lot of bands try and act like they have a big problem with that, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> their music, they are very 'deathcore.' I {{know that there is a}} lot of resentment towards deathcore and kind of younger bands." [...] Also in a 2012 interview with Chelsea Grin, guitarist Jake Harmond said: [...] "Everyone likes to flap their jaw and voice their own opinion how 'embarrassing' it is to be in a band that can be labeled 'deathcore,' but honestly we have never given a fuck." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{the time}} he was {{studying}} the Qur'an, Stevens began to identify more and more with the story of Joseph, a man bought and sold in the market place, which is how he said he had increasingly felt within the music business. Regarding his conversion, in his 2006 interview with Alan Yentob, he stated, [...] "to some people, it may have seemed like an enormous jump, but for me, it was a gradual move to this." [...] And, in a Rolling Stone magazine interview, he reaffirmed this, saying, [...] "I had found the spiritual home I'd been seeking for most of my life. And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> my music and lyrics, like [...] "Peace Train" [...] and [...] "On The Road To Find Out", it clearly shows my yearning for direction and the spiritual path I was travelling." ...|$|E
2500|$|Late in life, Porter {{said that}} among his {{favorites}} {{of his career}} recordings were Atkins's The Most Popular Guitar, an album recorded with lush string orchestration, and Jerry Byrd's Byrd of Paradise, recorded during Porter's stint with Monument Records. Regarding the Nashville Sound, Porter {{believed that it was}} in the people who were involved: Hank Garland, Ray Edenton, Buddy Harman, Harold Bradley, Bob Moore, Boots Randolph, Floyd Cramer, Velma Smith, Charlie McCoy, the Anita Kerr Singers, and the Jordanaires. He said, [...] "They play perfectly together because they were like family. They did it without thinking!... They played methodical yet simple rhythm patterns or fills. It was almost a jazz concept from the standpoint that {{a lot of it is}} in their head. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> Hank Garland, you won't hear the same lick twice." ...|$|E
2500|$|Loaded was a {{commercial}} effort aimed at radio play, another {{step away from}} the Warhol-influenced experimental days of their earlier albums. The album's title refers to Atlantic's request that the band produce an album [...] "loaded with hits". Singer/bassist Doug Yule said, [...] "On Loaded there was a big push to produce a hit single, there was that mentality, which one of these is a single, how does it sound when we cut it down to 3.5 minutes, so that was a major topic for the group at that point. And I think that the third album to a great extent shows a lot of that in that a lot of those songs were designed as singles and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> them you can hear the derivation, like {{this is sort of a}} Phil Spector-ish kind of song, or this is that type of person song." ...|$|E

2500|$|On June 3, 2011, Against Me! {{announced}} that they started their own record label, Total Treble Music. [...] In November 2011, the band started working on [...] "new material" [...] for the next album. It {{turned out to be}} a false start, they scrapped it and went on tour. They started recording the album again in February 2012 at Total Treble Studio, with Grace taking complete creative control, acting as both recording engineer and record producer for the album. In May 2012, Grace publicly came out as transgender. Bowman recalled that [...] "he wasn't really surprised" [...] when Grace came out, because when he thought about it, [...] "the signs had always been there, especially <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> the lyrics".

2500|$|Sea Change {{is based}} around a musical suite of reflective, acoustic-based songs that {{showcase}} Beck's singer-songwriter side. The term sea change {{is defined as}} a broad transformation, which reflects the departure in style from both Beck's previous effort Midnite Vultures and previous, sample-based recordings, as well as Beck's desire to give each album an identity. Origins for the album's unique, passionate sound had been building up for years, according to Beck in a 2002 interview: [...] "There are threads of what I've done before. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> my earlier B- sides, you'll hear this record. I have been wanting to make this record for years," [...] he explained. [...] "I've been edging towards the idea, and so it just took a while." [...] Despite initial difficulty upon deciding on the name, the title originates from [...] "Little One", the eleventh track on the album: [...] "Drown, drown / Sailors run aground / In a sea change nothing is safe".|$|E
2500|$|Because {{the drums}} were {{recorded}} {{prior to the}} guitars, Bart had to write his guitar riffs {{so that they would}} compliment the drums and not vice versa. Bart elaborated, [...] "Following the September sessions I went back to work out the harmonies and write {{a whole new set of}} guitars trying to see them from a different point of view. The main challenge was to stay within the parameters of the drums - either that or we would have to re-record them again. So I had to be very creative to make the songs interesting without introducing new sections or tempo changes. This is why there are so many harmonies and counter melodies. It was challenging - often I would just jam to the recorded tracks for a long time trying to find a different vibe then that already recorded... this is best apparent on To the Bitter End or Tunnel Effect. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> both guitars, they're doing widely different things yet compliment each other really well." ...|$|E
