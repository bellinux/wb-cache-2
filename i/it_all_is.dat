Palmer noted {{alterations}} {{within the}} depiction of the Bennet family; Stewart-Beer remarked that while their family home [...] "might be chaotic, in this version it is, at heart, a happy home—much happier and much less dysfunctional, than Austen's original version of Longbourn... For one, Mr and Mrs Bennet actually seem to like each other, even love each other, a characterisation which {{is a far cry}} from the source text." [...] Producer Paul Webster acknowledged the familial theme in the DVD featurette [...] "A Bennet Family Portrait", remarking [...] "Yes, it's a great love story between Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy, but underpinning <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>is</b> the kind of love that runs this family." ...|$|E

Mandler spoke to MTV News, stating [...] "I think that with this song and the meaning of this song and how loaded <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>is,</b> no pun intended, how much imagery and perhaps symbolism that is loaded in this song, {{the only way to do}} it was to do something that was visually challenging". The music video for the song premiered on ABC's 20/20 on November 13, 2009.|$|E

500|$|O'Reilly {{explained}} that Naomi's style was {{harder to get}} right and she worked with the producers, costume and make-up departments {{to find the right}} look. The actress said, [...] "she has {{to have a sense of}} sass and sexuality about her, but she's not cheap and she has worked very hard to shake off her trashy past. What we've come up with is amazing. Some days I put my costume on for a scene and think, 'Oh Naomi, you're outrageous! I could never wear this! Oh well. Go get 'em girl!'" [...] O'Reilly thought some of Naomi's outfits complimented her [...] "quite sexual" [...] nature, especially the six-inch heels and small tops. O'Reilly admitted that she did not have too much in common with Naomi, but they could both be [...] "goofy and funny". She thought Naomi was definitely not as level-headed as she was in real life. She also said that she enjoyed playing a character who was different from herself. Executive producer Jason Herbison told Sarah Ellis from Inside Soap that he thought Naomi's type of character – a [...] "classic, troublemaking vixen, who underneath <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>is</b> just deeply insecure" [...] – had been missing from Neighbours for a few years.|$|E
500|$|Discussing the {{campaign}} for Wired.com, Emma Grey Ellis called it [...] "a relentless marketing siege of every platform you would think of—and some you didn’t ... as crazy and unrelenting as <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>is,</b> isn’t this exactly what we want from Deadpool?" [...] Bobby Anhalt at Screen Rant called it possibly [...] "the best film marketing campaign {{in the history of}} cinema", and noted that Deadpool's fourth wall breaking allowed [...] "the marketing team [...] make stunts that appear as though the character himself is crafting them." [...] HostGator's Jeremy Jensen attributed {{the campaign}}'s success to Reynolds, as well as Fox embracing the film's R rating. He concluded that, [...] "More than anything the Deadpool marketing campaign managed to create a relationship with the people who ended up going to see it. They were honest, creative, and completely relentless." [...] Alisha Grauso of Forbes felt the campaign's success came from the marketing team understanding the character, having freedom from the usual creative constraints put on film marketers, and not revealing much of the film's actual content. Grauso also praised the marketing team for utilizing Reynolds, and said, [...] "Audiences have been more than ready for the weird and wild, and that's the point—Fox was smart enough to see that and run with it. Most marketing campaigns don't give audiences credit for being all that intelligent or open-minded, but {{the campaign for}} Deadpool didn't hold back ... was just like the character himself. Unpredictable, non sequitur, hilarious, perverse, and popping up in the strangest of places." ...|$|E
500|$|McKay {{stated that}} Rudd helped him rewrite the script, calling Rudd [...] "great with dialogue", adding [...] "the {{two of us}} holed up in hotel rooms on {{the east and west}} coast, and I think it was like six to eight weeks we just ground it out and did a giant rewrite of the script. I was really proud of what we did, I really thought we put some amazing stuff in there and built on an already strong script from Edgar Wright and sort of just {{enhanced}} some stuff." [...] Rudd elaborated, [...] "The idea, the trajectory, the goal, and the blueprint of <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> <b>is</b> really Edgar and Joe. It's their story. We changed some scenes, we added new sequences, we changed some characters, we added new characters. If you took the two scripts and held them up together they'd be very different—but the idea is all theirs." [...] Reed also offered contributions to the revised script, as did Lilly and Stoll, who contributed ideas to help flesh out their respective characters. Lilly's character received a fuller arc and more action sequences as a result. One of the important things when joining the film for Reed was emphasizing both Hope and Janet van Dyne more, given the Wasp being [...] "a crucial part" [...] of the Ant-Man comics. For their efforts, McKay and Rudd were credited as additional writers of the screenplay, with Wright and Cornish credited for the screenplay and story. Wright also held an executive producer credit on the film.|$|E

Big Screen! gets a few things right that a trivia game should — the clips are plentiful, the round with the edited photos is fun, and there's {{a fair amount of}} questions here — but the things it misses sink any shot this game had at being something you need to play". GameZone commented [...] "Scene It? features plenty of movie trivia factoids to keep cinemaphiles happy, but a dearth of features (no online play?!?) and the availability of other, better trivia games for PlayStation 3 makes me doubt that this was ever intended for the big screen to begin with". In contrast, Game Revolution cited [...] "Scene It? can only be entertaining — not to mention, fair — if everyone playing not only has comparable movie knowledge but also comparable gaming experience, which is completely ridiculous for a casual party game. And the thing that's so irritating about <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>is</b> that these problems could have been fixed with almost zero effort".|$|E
2500|$|Decades {{after its}} {{original}} release, Black Sunday {{has continued to}} maintain a positive critical reputation. [...] Pauline Kael described it as [...] "a rich draught of vampire's blood. With its crypts and cobwebs and eerie old castles set in batty, steamy forests, its sumptuous enough to have acquired a considerable reputation." [...] In [...] The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural (1986), Timothy Sullivan wrote, [...] "A supremely atmospheric horror film, Black Sunday was Mario Bava's first and best directorial job, and {{the first of the}} 1960s cycle of Italian Gothic cinema [...] remains [...] greatest achievement, without a doubt one of the best horror films ever made." [...] Phil Hardy's [...] observed, [...] "Bava's first (and best) film as a solo director [...] The movie derives its lyrical force and indeed its sense of horror from the knowledge that a woman's sexuality cannot be eliminated and will return, bearing the scars of the violence with which it was repressed, to challenge the order of things." [...] Danny Peary, in his Cult Movies book, wrote, [...] "Black Sunday is as impressive as it is because it reveals Bava's background – almost everything is conveyed visually...It is with his camera that Bava [...] creates an atmosphere where the living and dead coexist (but not harmoniously) [...] Black Sunday convinced many of us that Mario Bava would be {{a force to be reckoned}} with in the horror field for many years to come. Unfortunately, he never made another picture half as good." [...] Allmovie has noted, [...] "Generally considered to be the foremost example of Italian gothic horror, this darkly atmospheric black-and-white chiller put director Mario Bava on the international map ... The atmosphere is so heavy and the imagery so dense that the film becomes nearly too rich in texture, but the sheer, ghastly beauty of <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>is</b> entrancing." [...] Glenn Erickson, in reviewing the Anchor Bay DVD release of the film, wrote, [...] "Mario Bava's first credited feature is still the number one film of the Italian horror renaissance, startlingly original and genuinely creepy [...] The budget may have been low, but Black Sunday is more atmospheric and cinematically active than any of Hollywood's classic horror films." [...] The film has an 84% favorable rating on the [...] "Critical Tomatometer" [...] at the Rotten Tomatoes website, out of nineteen internet reviewers surveyed.|$|E
