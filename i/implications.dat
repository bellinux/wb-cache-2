40|$|AbstractThe {{class of}} typed {{template}} dependencies is {{a class of}} data dependencies that includes embedded multivalued and join dependencies. It is shown that the <b>implication</b> and the finite <b>implication</b> problems for this class are unsolvable. An immediate corollary is that this class has no formal system for finite <b>implication.</b> It is also shown how to construct a finite set of typed template dependencies whose <b>implication</b> and finite <b>implication</b> problems are unsolvable. The class of projected join dependencies is a proper subclass of the above class, and it generalizes slightly embedded join dependencies. It is shown that the <b>implication</b> and the finite <b>implication</b> problems for this class are also unsolvable. An immediate corollary is that this class has no universe-bounded formal system for either <b>implication</b> or finite <b>implication...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Applying {{the idea}} of soft set theory to lattice <b>implication</b> algebras, the novel concept of (implicative) filteristic soft lattice <b>implication</b> algebras which related to (implicative) filter(for short, (IF-) F-soft lattice <b>implication</b> algebras) are introduced. Basic {{properties}} of (IF-) F-soft lattice <b>implication</b> algebras are derived. Two kinds of fuzzy filters (i. e. (∈, ∈ ∨qk) ((∈, ∈ ∨ qk)) -fuzzy (implicative) filter) of L are introduced, which are generalizations of fuzzy (implicative) filters. Some characterizations for a soft set to be a (IF-) F-soft lattice <b>implication</b> algebra are provided. Analogously, this idea {{can be used in}} other types of filteristic lattice <b>implication</b> algebras (such as fantastic (positive implicative) filteristic soft lattice <b>implication</b> algebras).
