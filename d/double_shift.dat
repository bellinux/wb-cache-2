He states {{that it is too}} dangerous for him to stay in Erinsborough and that she can bring her younger sister, Sophie (Kaiya Jones), with them. Kate tells Mark that she does not want to lose him and agrees to go. Mark reveals that they only have half an hour and heads over to his house to pack. Sophie returns home and Kate tells her that they are leaving town that night. An upset Sophie explains that she cannot pack her life up in a bag and refuses to go. Kate tells her the decision has already been made and they are leaving. As Mark is wondering whether to call his parents, his housemate, Jade Mitchell (Gemma Pranita), arrives home unexpectedly. When she enquires about his bag, he tells her he needs a change of clothes for a <b>double</b> <b>shift.</b> Kate finds Mark and asks for more time, but Mark tells her they do not have any. He gives her the details of the meeting point and they kiss, before Kate leaves him.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many other}} schools in Kyrgyzstan, Alisher Navoiy Secondary School is a <b>double</b> <b>shift</b> school where two streams of {{students}} (morning shift and evening shift) {{share the same}} facility. The {{reason for this is}} that school capacity is insufficient to teach all of the students on a normal, morning-to-afternoon, schedule.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the shift}} key, {{typewriters}} {{had to have}} a separate key and typebar for upper-case letters; in essence, the typewriter had two keyboards, one above the other. With the shift key, manufacturing costs (and therefore purchase price) were greatly reduced, and typist operation was simplified; both factors contributed greatly to mass adoption of the technology. Certain models, such as the Barlet, had a <b>double</b> <b>shift</b> so that each key performed three functions. These little three-row machines were portable and could be used by journalists.|$|E

25|$|Teaching is undervalued and underpaid as a {{profession}} and this was not helped by the selection procedure. Prior to 2010, students with lower achievement at grade 10 {{could go to a}} Teacher Training Institute (TTI) or a College of Teacher's Education (CTE) for a certificate or diploma. If students passed the EHEEE, education faculties took students with lower GPAs than other faculties. Teaching is hard work with high mean pupil/teacher ratios in primary schools and many operating a <b>double</b> <b>shift.</b> Many teachers lack motivation and 60% would move to another job if given the opportunity.|$|E
25|$|A new {{section of}} Stammheim Prison was built {{especially}} for the RAF and {{was considered one of}} the most secure prison blocks around the world at the time. The prisoners were transferred there in 1975 (three years after their arrest). The roof and the courtyard was covered with steel mesh. During the night the precinct was illuminated by fifty-four spotlights and twenty-three neon bulbs. Special military forces were guarding the roof, including snipers. Four hundred police officers along with the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution patrolled the building. The mounted police officers oscillated on a <b>double</b> <b>shift.</b> One hundred more GSG-9 units reinforced the police during the trial. BKA agents guarded the front of the court area. Finally there were helicopters flying around the area.|$|E
500|$|In his 1990 book Sea-Brothers: The Tradition of American Sea Fiction from Moby-Dick to the Present, author Bert Bender noted Crane's {{sympathetic}} {{portrayal of}} the oiler Billie, the most physically able of the four characters, and yet {{the only one to}} perish. The correspondent even notes with wonder Billie's exceptional ability to row despite having worked a <b>double</b> <b>shift</b> before the ship sank. Bender wrote that Crane [...] "emphasizes that Billie's steady, simple labor is the tangible basis for his role here as a savior," [...] and that the oiler's portrayal as a [...] "simple, working seaman, clearly expresses his sympathy with the democratic ideal of the sailor before the mast that figures so crucially in the tradition of American sea fiction." [...] That Billie does not survive the ordeal, however, can be seen as an antithesis to Darwinism in that the only person to not survive was in fact the strongest physically.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Double</b> <b>shift</b> {{school is}} a type of school which {{operates}} in two shifts, with one group of students in the building early in the day and a second group of students later in the day.

To avoid crowded classrooms,a school may adopt a dual shift system without reducing the students actual study time.|$|E

30|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} paper is to analyze and implement two numerical algorithms for solving two kinds of space fractional linear advection-dispersion problems. The proposed numerical solutions are spectral and they are built on assuming the approximate solutions to be certain <b>double</b> <b>shifted</b> Tchebyshev basis. The two typical collocation and Petrov-Galerkin spectral methods are applied to obtain the desired numerical solutions. The special feature of the two proposed methods is that their applications enable one to reduce, through integration, the fractional problem under investigation into linear systems of algebraic equations, which can be efficiently solved via any suitable solver. The convergence and error analysis of the <b>double</b> <b>shifted</b> Tchebyshev basis are carefully investigated, aiming to illustrate the correctness and feasibility of the proposed double expansion. Finally, the efficiency, applicability, and high accuracy of the suggested algorithms are demonstrated by presenting some numerical examples accompanied with comparisons with some other existing techniques discussed in the literature.|$|R
