50|$|Luzula sylvatica, {{commonly}} known as greater wood-rush or <b>great</b> <b>wood-rush,</b> is a perennial flowering plant in the rush family Juncaceae.|$|E
50|$|There is oak {{woodland}} {{as part of}} the notification complex. This {{is usually}} coppiced. The ground flora includes bilberry, bracken, and <b>great</b> <b>wood-rush.</b>|$|E
50|$|These woods have ash, {{lime and}} sessile oak, {{together}} with wild service-trees, {{which is an}} indicator of ancient woodland. The ground flora is very rich, including locally unusual plants such as lily-of-the-valley, wood spurge, <b>great</b> <b>wood-rush,</b> violet helleborine and columbine.|$|E
50|$|Ground-layer {{plants are}} {{dominated}} by bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), bramble (Rubus fruticosus), common bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), dog's mercury (Mercurialis perennis), false brome (Brachypodium sylvaticum), <b>great</b> <b>wood-rush</b> (Luzula sylvatica). Scarce and locally uncommon plants that {{are found in the}} gorge are narrow-leaved bittercress (Cardamine impatiens), stinking hellebore (Helleborus foetidus), wood barley (Hordelymus europaeus) and wood fescue (Festuca altissima).|$|E
50|$|In the species-poor oak, beech {{and pine}} woods the ground flora mainly {{consists}} of acid-soil loving (acidophilic) species. Examples are <b>great</b> <b>wood-rush,</b> white wood-rush, pill sedge and wavy hair-grass. Also characteristic are various species of fern such as deer fern, lemon-scented fern and royal fern, which prefer shady, temperate, wet locations. Another {{feature of the}} bunter sandstone mountains are its rich mushroom and berry communities. Blueberries cover large areas and, in suitable places, cowberries.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{distinct}} assemblages of flora are observed at Briarwood Banks. Dominant on lower slopes is wych elm (Ulmus glabra), beneath which are found dog’s mercury (Mercurialis perennis), woodruff (Galium odoratum), wood melick (Melica uniflora), giant bellflower (Campanula latifolia), enchanter’s nightshade (Circaea lutetiana) and wood avens (Geum urbanum). Oak (Quercus petraea) predominates the higher slopes with creeping soft-grass (Holcus mollis), false brome (Brachypodium sylvaticum), wood sorrel (Oxalis acetosella) and broad buckler-fern (Dryopteris dilatata); and on very acid soil beneath oaks, <b>great</b> <b>wood-rush</b> (Luzula sylvatica), bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and common cow-wheat (Melampyrum pratense) are found.|$|E
