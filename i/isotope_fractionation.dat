40|$|Crystallization {{temperatures}} of the oceanic carbonatites of Fuerteventura, Canary Islands, have been determined from oxygen <b>isotope</b> <b>fractionations</b> between calcite, silicate minerals (feldspar, pyroxene, biotite, and zircon) and magnetite. The measured fractionations have been interpreted {{in the light}} of late stage interactions with meteoric and/or magmatic water. Cathodoluminescence characteristics were investigated for the carbonatite minerals {{in order to determine the}} extent of alteration and to select unaltered samples. Oxygen <b>isotope</b> <b>fractionations</b> of minerals of unaltered samples yield crystallization temperatures between 450 and 960 degreesC (average 710 degreesC). The highest temperature is obtained from pyroxene-calcite pairs. The above range is in agreement with other carbonatite thermometric Studies. This is the first study that provides oxygen isotope data coupled with a CL study on carbonatite-related zircon. The CL pictures revealed that the zircon is broken and altered in the carbonatites and in associated syenites. Regarding geological field evidences of syenite-carbonatite relationship and the close agreement of published zircon U/Pb and whole rock and biotite K/Ar and Ar-Ar age data, the most probable process is early zircon crystallization from the syenite magma and late-stage reworking during magma evolution and carbonatite segregation.

Iron isotopes therefore potentially constrain the mechanisms and pathways of Fe redox transformations in modern and ancient environments. In the present study, we followed in batch experiments Fe <b>isotope</b> <b>fractionations</b> between Fe(II) _(aq) and Fe(III) oxide/hydroxide precipitates produced by the Fe(III) mineral encrusting, nitrate-reducing, Fe(II) -oxidizing Acidovorax sp. strain BoFeN 1. Isotopic fractionation in ^(56) Fe/^(54) Fe approached that expected for equilibrium conditions, assuming an equilibrium Δ^(56) Fe_(Fe(OH) 3 –Fe(II) aq) fractionation factor of + 3. 0 ‰. Previous studies have shown that Fe(II) oxidation by this Acidovorax strain occurs in the periplasm, and we propose that Fe isotope equilibrium is maintained through redox cycling via coupled electron and atom exchange between Fe(II) _(aq) and Fe(III) precipitates in the contained environment of the periplasm. In addition to the apparent equilibrium isotopic fractionation, these experiments also record the kinetic effects of initial rapid oxidation, and possible phase transformations of the Fe(III) precipitates. Attainment of Fe isotope equilibrium between Fe(III) oxide/hydroxide precipitates and Fe(II) _(aq) by neutrophilic, Fe(II) -oxidizing bacteria or through abiologic Fe(II) _(aq) oxidation is generally not expected or observed, because the poor solubility of their metabolic product, i. e. Fe(III), usually leads to rapid precipitation of Fe(III) minerals, and hence expression of a kinetic fractionation upon precipitation; in the absence of redox cycling between Fe(II) _(aq) and precipitate, kinetic <b>isotope</b> <b>fractionations</b> are likely to be retained.

25|$|Natural {{processes}} {{result in}} broad {{variations in the}} D/H ratio found in different pools of hydrogen. Kinetic isotope effects and physical changes such as precipitation and evaporation lead to these observed variations. Ocean water varies slightly, between 0 and -10 per mil, while atmospheric water can be found to vary between approximately -200 to +100 per mil. Biomolecules synthesized by organisms will retain some of the D/H signature of the water which they were grown on, plus a large fractionation factor which can be as great as several hundred per mil. Large D/H differences amounting to thousands of per mil can be found between Earth and other planetary bodies such as Mars, likely due to variations in <b>isotope</b> <b>fractionation</b> during planet formation and the physical loss of hydrogen to space.|$|E
25|$|Organic {{geochemistry}} is {{the study}} of organic molecules that appear in the fossil record in sedimentary rocks. Research in this field concerns molecular fossils that are often lipid biomarkers. Molecules like sterols and hopanoids, membrane lipids found in eukaryotes and bacteria, respectively, can be preserved in the rock record on billion-year timescales. Following the death of the organism they came from and sedimentation, they undergo a process called diagenesis whereby many of the specific functional groups from the lipids are lost, but the hydrocarbon skeleton remains intact. These fossilized lipids are called steranes and hopanes, respectively. There are also other types of molecular fossils, like porphyrins, the discovery of which in petroleum by Alfred E. Treibs actually led to the invention of the field. Other aspects of geochemistry that are also pertinent to geobiology include isotope geochemistry, in which scientists search for <b>isotope</b> <b>fractionation</b> in the rock record, and the chemical analysis of biominerals, such as magnetite or microbially-precipitated gold.|$|E
25|$|Almost all of {{the organic}} {{hydrogen}} is exchangeable to some extent. Isotopic exchange of organic hydrogen will reorder the distribution of deuterium and often incorporate external hydrogen. Generally, more mature materials are more substantially exchanged. With effective exchange, aliphatic hydrogen can finally reach isotopic equilibrium at the final stage. Equilibrium fractionation factor varies among different hydrogen sites. For example, aliphatic hydrogen <b>isotope</b> <b>fractionation</b> depends on the carbon atom that the hydrogen atom bonds with. To the first order, alkyl hydrogen isotope composition follows this trend: δDPrimary carbon < δDSecondary carbon < δDTertiary carbon. The fractionation factors between carbon sites also decrease with increasing temperature. This can be potentially used as a thermo-history indicator. The fractionation between whole molecule and water can be estimated by averaging all hydrogen-positions, and {{this leads to a}} relatively small variation of equilibrium fractionation between different groups of hydrocarbons and water. A theoretical prediction estimated this to be -80‰ to -95‰ for steranes, -90‰ to -95‰ for hopanes, and -70‰ to -95‰ for typical cycloparaffins between 0°C to 100°C. At the temperature of the oil window and gas window, the equilibrium fractionation between different group of organic molecules is relatively small, as compared with large primary signals.|$|E

25|$|As f {{decreases}} progressively during condensation, {{the remaining}} vapor {{becomes more and}} more depleted of the heavy isotopes, and the magnitude of depletion becomes larger as f approaches zero. The Rayleigh distillation process can explain some first-order spatial patterns observed in the isotopic composition of precipitation across the globe, including isotopic depletion from the tropics to the poles, isotopic depletion from coastal to inland regions, and isotopic depletion with elevation over a mountain range, all of which are associated with progressive moisture loss during transport. The Rayleigh distillation model {{can also be used to}} explain the strong correlation between δD and δ18O observed in global precipitation, expressed as the global meteoric water line (GMWL): δD=8δ18O+10 (later updated to δD=8.17±0.07 δ18O+11.27±0.65) The slope of the GMWL reflects the relative magnitude of hydrogen and oxygen <b>isotope</b> <b>fractionation</b> during condensation. It should be noted that the intercept of GMWL is non-zero (called deuterium-excess, or d-excess), which means ocean water does fall on GMWL. This is associated with the kinetic isotope effect during evaporation when water vapor diffuses from the saturated boundary layer to the unsaturated transition zone, and cannot be explained by the Rayleigh model. Nevertheless, the robust pattern in GMWL strongly suggests a single dominant moisture source to the global atmosphere, which is the tropical western Pacific. It should also be pointed out that a local meteoric water line can have a different slope and intercept from the GMWL, due to differences in humidity and evaporation intensity at different places. Hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in water thus serve as an excellent tracer of the hydrological cycle both globally and locally.|$|E

500|$|Calcium <b>isotope</b> <b>fractionation</b> during mineral {{formation}} has led {{to several}} applications of calcium isotopes. In particular, the 1997 observation by Skulan and DePaolo that calcium minerals are isotopically lighter than the solutions from which the minerals precipitate {{is the basis of}} analogous applications in medicine and in paleooceanography. In animals with skeletons mineralized with calcium, the calcium isotopic composition of soft tissues reflects the relative rate of formation and dissolution of skeletal mineral. In humans, changes in the calcium isotopic composition of urine {{have been shown to be}} related to changes in bone mineral balance. When the rate of bone formation exceeds the rate of bone resorption, the 44Ca/40Ca ratio in soft tissue rises and vice versa. Because of this relationship, calcium isotopic measurements of urine or blood may be useful in the early detection of metabolic bone diseases like osteoporosis. A similar system exists in seawater, where 44Ca/40Ca tends to rise when the rate of removal of Ca2+ by mineral precipitation exceeds the input of new calcium into the ocean. In 1997 Skulan and DePaolo presented the first evidence of change in seawater 44Ca/40Ca over geologic time, along with a theoretical explanation of these changes. More recent papers have confirmed this observation, demonstrating that seawater Ca2+ concentration is not constant, and that the ocean is never in a [...] "steady state" [...] with respect to calcium input and output.

2500|$|Water is {{the primary}} source of {{hydrogen}} to all living organisms, so the isotopic composition of environmental water is a first-order control on that of the biosphere. The hydrological cycle moves water around different reservoirs {{on the surface of the}} earth, during which hydrogen isotopes in water are significantly fractionated. [...] As the primary moisture source to the atmosphere, the ocean has a relatively uniform hydrogen isotope composition across the globe around 0‰ (VSMOW). Variations of δD larger than 10‰ in the ocean are generally confined to surface waters due to evaporation, sea ice formation, and addition of meteoric waters by precipitation, rivers or icebergs. In the hydrological cycle, the two major processes that fractionate hydrogen isotopes from ocean water are evaporation and condensation.

The deuterium content should reflect the source kerogen signal, generation fractionation, isotopic exchange and other maturation effects. The thermal maturation at the oil window can erase much of the primary signals of hydrogen isotopes. The formation of oil involves breaking C-C and C-H bonds, resulting in depletion of 13C and D in the products and enrichment in the residual reactants due to kinetic isotope effects. Yongchun Tang and his colleagues modeled this process based on laboratory-calibrated kinetics data {{and found that the}} frequency factor ratio for D/H is 1.07. Moreover, oil is also affected by the <b>isotope</b> <b>fractionation</b> from phase-change. However, the behavior of oil gas-liquid fractionation differs from water as the vapor phase of oil is enriched in D. This will deplete residual oil as it gets evaporated. Biological degradation of oil is also expected to fractionate hydrogen isotopes, as enzymatic breaking of C-H bond have a normal kinetic isotope effect. Several degradation experiments show that this fractionation {{is generally}} mild, ranging from -11‰ to -79‰. This process should also enrich partially degraded oil. Finally, oil stored in a reservoir often had migrated through subsurface (also known as [...] "geochromatography") from another source region, interacting with water.
