5|$|In the 1990s, the Deep River Historical Society of Deep River, Connecticut {{discovered}} {{a photo of}} the light and began to research its history. Joel Severance, chairman of the harbor commission, wanted to build a 28-foot (8.5 meter) tall replica that would primarily function as a <b>daymark</b> and their plan was endorsed by the Connecticut Department of Transportation in the United States Coast Guard and both the town of Deep River and Middlesex County, Connecticut, but it was expected to be denied by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection. In 2000, the plan was rejected by the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection.|$|E
5|$|Cape Moreton Light, also {{listed as}} North Point Range Rear Light, is an heritage-listed active {{lighthouse}} located on Cape Moreton, a rocky headland {{located at the}} north eastern tip of Moreton Island, a large sand island {{on the eastern side}} of Moreton Bay, on the coast of South East Queensland, Australia. It marks the northern entrance to Moreton Bay and Brisbane and also serves as the rear light for the North Point Range. With its two distinctive red bands, it also serves as a <b>daymark.</b> It is the oldest lighthouse in Queensland, and the only one to be built by the New South Wales Government before the separation of Queensland, which took place in 1859. It is also the only lighthouse in Queensland to be built of stone.|$|E
5|$|Chester Rock Light was a {{light in}} Chester, Connecticut on the Connecticut River. It was built in 1889 {{as part of a}} $15,000 {{appropriation}} by the United States Congress. The 21-foot (6.4 meter) tall wooden hexagonal pyramidal tower had a black lantern with a 6th order Fresnel lens. The light was first lit on July 1, 1889. The tower was replaced in 1912 by a skeleton tower that was subsequently modified in 1927. Records do not show the deactivation or destruction of the light, but it was believed to have been removed in the 1930s. In the 1990s, the Deep River Historical Society of Deep River, Connecticut wanted to build a replica of the structure for use as a <b>daymark.</b>|$|E

25|$|The towers {{were always}} insufficiently armed. They were used mainly as customs {{stations}} and <b>daymarks.</b> The torregiani often neglected their military role, {{to concentrate on}} the control of the maritime trade and the perception of various taxes. They were also trading wood and cultivating in the surrounding lands.|$|R
25|$|The site {{overlooks the}} 19th Century Martello tower of La Tour de Vinde. This {{is the black}} and white tower visible in the photo to the right. The tower is painted to serve as a <b>daymark.</b> There is no easy {{footpath}} from the battery to the tower.|$|E
25|$|It is {{attached}} to {{what remains of the}} pre-existing fort. The tower mounted three cannon, and in all the fort mounted ten cannons, none of which remain. The tower is the highest building on Barbuda and serves as a <b>daymark</b> from land or sea. Today the fort is a popular location for weddings.|$|E
25|$|Lighthouses near to {{each other}} that are similar in shape are often painted in a unique pattern so they can easily be {{recognized}} during daylight, a marking known as a <b>daymark.</b> The black and white barber pole spiral pattern of Cape Hatteras Lighthouse is one example. Race Rocks Light in western Canada is painted in horizontal black and white bands to stand out against the horizon.|$|E
5000|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was constructed}} in 1957. The original lighthouse was made out of wooden beams, however the lighthouse's wooden square structure was replaced with metal in the year 2000. The lighthouse has white and red slatted <b>daymarks</b> on {{the upper half of}} its structure. The lighthouse's glare configuration flashes three glares every 15 seconds.|$|R
50|$|Some of the {{surviving}} towers have been painted on the seaward side to serve as <b>daymarks</b> (navigational aids). Archirondel is painted red and white, while other towers are painted white and red, or white, {{in whole or in}} part, again, on the seaward side. The order below is counter-clockwise from the north-west corner of the island.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1990s the {{lighthouse}} at Herd Groyne {{on the opposite}} bank of the Tyne had a sector light installed for navigation into Tynemouth and along the river, whereupon the High and Low Lights were decommissioned and the buildings sold for housing. [...] The towers, however, continue to serve as <b>daymarks</b> for vessels entering the Tyne and both are listed buildings.|$|R
500|$|The Essex Reef Light or Essex Reef Post Light, {{also known}} as Hayden's Point Light, was a light in Essex, Connecticut on the Connecticut River. The [...] wooden tower was erected in 1889 and {{replaced}} with a skeleton tower by 1919. The skeleton tower was further altered to an automatic gas light a few years prior to 1931. Two of the keepers, Gilbert B. Hayden and Bernie Hayden, relation unknown, were keepers of the light, but their service years are unknown. As of 2014, a [...] skeleton tower serves as an active <b>daymark</b> {{and it has a}} green flash every 4 seconds.|$|E
500|$|A {{skeleton}} {{tower was}} already in place by 1919 and the date of replacement or removal of the original light is unknown. On December 17, 1919, the light characteristic was changed from fixed white to flashing white every 3 seconds and {{it was reported that}} the light's strength was 70 candlepower. In 1931, The Day noted that the skeleton tower was [...] "in recent years" [...] converted to automatic gas beacons. In 1963, buoys were established near the Essex Reef light. Currently the skeleton tower is active with a height of [...] and has a green flash every 4 seconds. It has a square green <b>daymark</b> with the number 25.|$|E
500|$|According to the Annual Report of the Lighthouse Board, {{the tower}} was struck and {{carried away by}} a barge being towed by Sachem, a tugboat, on May 10, 1912. The cost of repairs, $602.40, was paid by the owner. During the {{intervening}} period, a temporary light post was used in its place. Completed on October 22, 1912, the replacement skeletal tower was a pyramidal steel structure on a concrete base that held its oil internally. The base of the tower was painted white and the [...] <b>daymark</b> was painted black. The skeleton tower lantern was raised to [...] above the water and its light had about 170 candlepower.|$|E
50|$|The Coast Guard {{maintains}} the DGPS radio navigation system, {{as well as}} buoys, <b>daymarks,</b> and other visual aids to navigation ATONs in U.S. waters and in selected foreign waters - a major activity of Coast Guard buoy tenders, and of special Auxiliary patrols. The Coast Guard has three large icebreakers, and many cutters can clear ice-clogged waterways for essential seagoing traffic.|$|R
50|$|Sea marks {{are used}} to {{indicate}} channels, dangerous rocks or shoals, mooring positions, areas of speed limits, traffic separation schemes, submerged shipwrecks, and {{for a variety of}} other navigational purposes. Some are only intended to be visible in daylight (<b>daymarks),</b> others have some combination of lights, reflectors, bells, horns, whistles and radar reflectors to make them usable at night and in conditions of reduced visibility.|$|R
50|$|Dagu Light: The {{landfall}} {{marker for}} Tianjin Port is the Dagu (Old style: Taku) Lighthouse (大沽灯塔), a wave-washed lighthouse built in 1978 {{on the same}} spot where a lightship was first moored in 1878. The light is a cylindrical concrete tower <b>daymarked</b> with narrow horizontal red stripes on white, and riprap protection at its base. The lighthouse is situated at {{the western end of}} the Dagukou anchorage, mooring is prohibited for one mile around it.|$|R
500|$|The {{central tower}} is [...] across and [...] high, with [...] thick walls. The {{basement}} was originally a kitchen and storerooms, {{with the first}} floor was subdivided and used by the garrison, before being later converted for storing gunpowder. The bridge across the moat leads into to the second storey, which originally had four chambers with fireplaces and windows, linked by a central corridor; this area {{may have been used}} by the castle's officers, and to house an enlarged garrison in an emergency. The third floor forms a single, large room with gun embrasures, and was probably used by the garrison as living accommodation. Above it, the parapetted gun platform on the fourth floor could support up to seven guns and incorporates a lookout turret, topped by a 17th-century cupola, designed as a <b>daymark</b> to guide passing ships.|$|E
2500|$|The current {{tower is}} a [...] high {{fiberglass}} structure without a lantern, which also {{acts as a}} <b>daymark.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Because {{the brick}} {{deteriorated}} {{from exposure to}} the elements, a steel plate encasement was installed in 1900 {{at a cost of}} $3,225. [...] The yellow brick now encased in steel plate was difficult to see and a <b>daymark</b> was needed. [...] Several changes to the <b>daymark</b> over the years were made. [...] Currently, the tower is painted white with a black watch tower and a black band around the middle of the tower. [...] As shown in a historic post card, it was painted red and white at one time; later to become black and white.|$|E
5000|$|Where {{a channel}} is narrow, as in some harbor entrances and on some rivers, {{a system of}} beacons allows mariners to align pairs of <b>daymarks,</b> called [...] "range markers", to form a [...] "leading line" [...] (British English) or [...] "range axis" [...] (American English), along which to {{navigate}} safely. When lighted, these markers are called [...] "leading lights" [...] (British English) or [...] "range lights" [...] (American English). The relative positions of the marks and the vessel affect the accuracy of perceiving the leading line.|$|R

50|$|Following their {{acquisition}} of the patent, all English and Welsh lightvessels were maintained by Trinity House, {{with the exception of}} the four vessels in the approaches to the River Mersey, which were maintained by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board until 1973, and those in the Humber Estuary, which were the responsibility of the Humber Conservancy Board. In order to act as effective <b>daymarks</b> Trinity House lightvessels were painted red, with the station name in large white letters on the side of the hull, and a system of balls and cones at the masthead for identification. The first revolving light was fitted to the Swin Middle lightvessel in 1837: others used occulting or flashing lights. White lights were preferred for visibility though red and very occasionally green (as with the Mouse lightvessel) were also used.|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of the spatial distribution of fishing rooms demonstrates that French fishing crews preferentially exploited {{certain parts of the}} Petit Nord during their prosecution of the historic cod fishery between 1500 and 1904. This research investigates the environmental and cultural factors that influenced where sites were selected and subsequently established. Fishing harbours were the hubs of wider networks, both physical and cognitive, of resource acquisition and navigation. A system of landmarks, <b>daymarks</b> and anchorages warded a network of sailing routes linking fishing rooms to cod grounds and resource areas. Seasonal occupation led to the intense exploitation of natural resources and necessitated the installation of a landscape-based infrastructure to negotiate the division of shore space and allocation of timber and fresh water. The concept of the maritime cultural landscape is used to link the terrestrial sites of the fishery with the region’s network of marine exploitation, land use and navigation. Effects of cultural processes in the past persist in the patterns and character of land use, both cultural and semi-natural, on land and at sea, that are observable in the region today...|$|R
2500|$|A {{barber pole}} motif {{has been used}} as a <b>daymark</b> and navigational aid for {{lighthouse}}s. The White Shoal Light is the only [...] "barber pole" [...] lighthouse in the United States, and has been used in Michigan's [...] However, black and white helical daymarks do appear on other lights, such as Cape Hatteras Light and St. Augustine Light.|$|E
2500|$|A [...] "barber's pole" [...] with a helical stripe is a {{familiar}} sight, and {{is used as a}} secondary metaphor to describe objects in many other contexts. For example, if the shaft or tower of a lighthouse has been painted with a helical stripe as a <b>daymark,</b> the lighthouse could be described as having been painted in [...] "barber's pole" [...] colors. [...] Likewise, borders may be marked and warnings highlighted.|$|E
2500|$|The light {{displays}} a highly visible {{black and white}} diagonal <b>Daymark</b> paint job. [...] It shares similar markings with the St. Augustine Light. [...] Another lighthouse, with helical markings—red and white 'candy cane '-- is the White Shoal Light (Michigan), {{which is the only}} true 'barber pole' lighthouse in the United States.
