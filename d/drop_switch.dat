40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the performance of}} TCP connections over ATM networks without ATM-level congestion control, and {{compare it to the}} performance of TCP over packet-based networks. For simulations of congested networks, the effective throughput of TCP over ATM can be quite low when cells are dropped at the congested ATM switch. The low throughput is due to wasted bandwidth as the congested link transmits cells from `corrupted' packets, i. e., packets in which at least one cell is <b>dropped</b> by the <b>switch.</b> We investigate two packet discard strategies which alleviate the effects of fragmentation. Partial Packet Discard, in which remaining cells are discarded after one cell has been dropped from a packet, improves throughput somewhat.

40|$|Solid-state power {{converters}} {{are used in}} a rapidly growing number of applications including variable-speed motor drives for hybrid electric vehicles and industrial applications, battery energy storage systems, and for interfacing renewable energy sources and controlling power flow in electric power systems. The desire for higher power densities and improved efficiencies necessitates the accurate prediction of switching transients and losses that, historically, have been categorized as conduction and switching losses. In {{the vast majority of}} analyses, the power semiconductors (diodes, transistors) are represented using simplified or empirical models. Conduction losses are calculated as the product of circuit-dependent currents and on-state voltage <b>drops.</b> <b>Switching</b> losses are estimated using approximate voltage-current waveforms with empirically derived turn-on and turn-off times. With recent increases in switching speeds, these approximations are no longer valid in many applications. Although it is possible to simulate {{power converters}} using physics-based models of power semiconductors based upon coupled drift, diffusion, continuity (CDDC) equations, such simulations are generally prohibitively slow. In this thesis, a variable-structure variable-order simulation paradigm is set forth in which the detailed CCDC-based models are used to calculate the switching transients and corresponding losses. As devices (e. g., diodes) become active or inactive, the structure and order of the simulation is dynamically changed without sacrificing accuracy. A time-step control algorithm is devised such that the overall simulation captures only the relevant transients. Finally, parallelization strategies are identified that can produce a 483 % improvement in simulation speed compared with a conventional solution of the CDDC equations. ...|$|R

50|$|A speedy {{switching}} device is an NPN avalanche transistor {{fitted with a}} coil between base and emitter. The transistor is initially switched off and about 300 volts exists across its collector-base junction. This voltage is high enough that a charge carrier in this region can create more carriers by impact ionisation, but the probability is too low to form a proper avalanche; instead a somewhat noisy leakage current flows. When the preceding stage switches, the emitter-base junction is pushed into forward bias and the collector-base junction enters full avalanche mode, so charge carriers injected into the collector-base region multiply in a chain reaction. Once the Marx generator has completely fired, voltages everywhere <b>drop,</b> each <b>switch</b> avalanche stops, its matched coil puts its base-emitter junction into reverse bias, and the low static field allows remaining charge carriers to drain out of its collector-base junction.|$|R

PWM also works well with digital controls, which, because of their on/off nature, can easily set the needed duty cycle.|$|R
