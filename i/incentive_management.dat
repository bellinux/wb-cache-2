It identifies geography, ownership and industry {{as the most important}} factors for wage differentiation within the Polish labor market. Another essential finding is that the companies primarily use specific Polish methods of job evaluation for determining the base salary of their employees and that there are still certain methodological problems in this area of compensation management. Polish corporations also take a more and more systematic approach in the area of performance appraisal and variable pay {{as well as in the}} field of <b>incentives</b> <b>management.</b> Finally, the issue of social insurance contributions is covered.

This report is a first approach to multi-level markets for virtual goods {{from the viewpoint of}} theoretical economy. A generic, kinematic model for the monetary flow in multi-level markets, which quantitatively describes the incentives that buyers receive through resale revenues, is devised. Building on it, the competition of goods is examined in a dynamical, utilitytheoretic model enabling, in particular, a treatment of the free-rider problem. The most important implications for the design of multi-level market mechanisms for virtual goods, or multi-level <b>incentive</b> <b>management</b> systems, are outlined...|$|E

Larger <b>incentive</b> <b>management</b> fees lead to less counter-cyclical or more pro-cyclical volatility timing. But fund styles or aggregate fund flows could also {{account for this}} relation, therefore, we control for them and find that the relation between fees and volatility timing still holds. Results show that less aggressive fund styles are associated with pro-cyclical volatility timing, and that volatility timing and flow timing are negatively related. We also find that pro-cyclical timing mostly improves funds ’ average excess returns, Sharpe ratios, and alphas. JEL classification: G 11; G 23...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} MoB, {{an infrastructure}} for collaborative wide-area wireless data services. MoB proposes {{to change the}} current model of data services in the following fundamental ways: (1) it decouples infrastructure providers from services providers and enables finegrained competition, (2) it allows service interactions on arbitrary timescales, and, (3) it promotes flexible composition of these finegrained service interactions based on user and application needs. At the heart of MoB is an open market architecture in which mobile users can opportunistically trade various services {{with each other in}} a flexible manner. In this paper we first describe the overall architecture of MoB including various enablers like user reputation management, <b>incentive</b> <b>management,</b> and accounting services. We next present our experience from both simulations as well as our prototype implementation of MoB in enhancing application performance in multiple different scenarios — file transfers, web browsing, media streaming, and location-enhanced services...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Information {{systems are}} {{becoming}} ever more reliant on {{different forms of}} social computing, employing individuals, crowds or assembled teams of professionals. With humans as first-class elements, the success of such systems depends heavily on how well we can motivate people {{to act in a}} planned fashion. Incentives {{are an important part of}} human resource management, manifesting selective and motivating effects. However, support for defining and executing incentives in today’s information systems is underdeveloped, often being limited to simple, per-task cash rewards. Furthermore, no systematic approach to program incentive functionalities for this type of platforms exists. In this paper we present fundamental elements of a framework for programmable <b>incentive</b> <b>management</b> in information systems. These elements form the basis necessary to support modeling, programming, and execution of various incentive mechanisms. They can be integrated with different underlying systems, promoting portability and reuse of proven incentive strategies. We carry out a functional design evaluation by illustrating modeling and composing capabilities of a prototype implementation on realistic incentive scenarios...|$|E
40|$|Cultural {{entrepreneurship}} {{involves a}} conception, an initial launch, and {{a transition to}} an established event. Each stage generates “wicked” coordination and financial challenges. We explore this important process by examining {{the history of the}} Banff Television Festival, an annual event featuring a competition, workshops, and providing a forum for developing projects. The documentation indicates that the anticipated problems of nonprofit activities — inefficient administration, crude management systems, slow adaptation and little innovation — were not characteristic of the Banff experience. Well informed industry “customers” and patrons have established an environment which generally encouraged managerial competence and creativity. This benign result may not generalize to other cultural initiatives, in particular to those that serve the public directly and draw patronage from diverse sources.

40|$|This paper explains, {{through a}} field study and from an agency perspective, how {{monitoring}} and incentive alignment mechanisms change {{to support the}} interests of a privatized firm's new ownership. In this case, privatization led to important changes in {{the board of directors}} and to more formal performance evaluation and compensation systems for top managers, as profitability and financial control gained relevancy with the firm ownership change. Our results show that differences in <b>incentives</b> <b>management</b> before and after privatization are due to different agency relations in the two periods. We also argue that in a privatization framework the relation between monitoring and incentive alignment mechanisms is complex, not simply substitutive as agency theory would predict, and this finding allows us to refine and extend agency theory for this specific context.
