5|$|The Catholic Church <b>in</b> <b>Afghanistan</b> <b>is</b> {{part of the}} {{worldwide}} Latin Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the Pope in Rome. There are very few Catholics in this overwhelmingly Muslim country—just over 200 attend Mass in its only chapel—and freedom of religion {{has been difficult to}} obtain in recent times, especially under the former Taliban regime.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} squad {{automatic weapon}} <b>in</b> <b>Afghanistan</b> <b>is</b> the M249 with PIP kit, which serves alongside its heavier counterpart, the M240 machine gun. Most M249s {{were given a}} collapsible buttstock immediately prior to the invasion to reduce its length and make the weapons more practical for parachuting and close-quarters combat. Special Operations troops typically favor the shorter Para version of the weapon, which weighs much less.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic {{community}} <b>in</b> <b>Afghanistan</b> <b>is</b> mainly made of foreigners, especially aid workers, and no Afghans {{are known}} to be currently part of the Church, mainly due to great social and legal pressure not to convert to non-Islamic religions. Some Afghans have converted while overseas, but they keep it secret when they return. Two Christian groups, Church World Service and Norwegian Church Aid, were accused of proselytizing while doing aid work in Afghanistan, which they denied, and 1,000 Afghans protested in Mazar-i-Sharif and burned the pope in effigy. Despite this, the community has grown from only a few sisters to a full Sunday Mass of around 100. Church attendance dipped in 2012 due to security concerns and less emphasis on religion among the foreigners in Afghanistan in recent years.|$|E

5|$|Karmal {{was born}} Sultan Hussein on 6 January 1929, {{was the son}} of Muhammad Hussein Hashem, a Major General in the Afghan Army and former {{governor}} of the province of Paktia, and was the second of five siblings. His family was one of the wealthier families in Kabul. His ethnic background is disputed, some claim that he was Tajik who represented himself as a Ghilzai Pashtun but others claim that he descended from Hindu ancestors of Kashmir. In 1986, Karmal announced that he, and his brother Mahmud Baryalay, were Pashtun because their mother came from the Mullakhel branch of the Pashtuns. However, this was controversial, considering that lineage <b>in</b> <b>Afghanistan</b> <b>is</b> supposed to be traced through the father, not the mother. The accusation that he was of Indian Muslim ancestry {{comes from the fact that}} his birthname, Sultan Hussein, is a common Indian Muslim name. In addition, Karmal's own father denied his own ethnicity; Karmal's father was a Tajik. To further confuse the matter, Karmal spoke Dari (Persian) and not Pashto.|$|E

25|$|The British 16th Air Assault Brigade (later {{reinforced}} by Royal Marines) formed {{the core of}} the force in southern Afghanistan, along with troops and helicopters from Australia, Canada and the Netherlands. The initial force consisted of roughly 3,300 British, 2,000 Canadian, 1,400 from the Netherlands and 240 from Australia, along with special forces from Denmark and Estonia and small contingents from other nations. The monthly supply of cargo containers through Pakistani route to ISAF <b>in</b> <b>Afghanistan</b> <b>is</b> over 4,000 costing around 12 billion in Pakistani Rupees.|$|E

They have repeatedly criticised the former Labour Government for failing to equip British Forces adequately in the earlier days on the campaign–especially highlighting the shortage of helicopters for British Forces resulting from Gordon Brown's £1.4bn cut to the helicopter budget in 2004.|$|E

25|$|The city of Kandahar <b>in</b> <b>Afghanistan</b> <b>is</b> said to {{have been}} named after Gandhara. According to H.W. Bellow, an {{emigrant}} from Gandhara in the 5th century brought this name to modern Kandahar. Faxian reported that the Buddha's alms-bowl existed in Peshawar Valley when he visited around 400 (chapter XII). In 1872 Bellow saw this huge begging bowl (seven feet in diameter) preserved in the shrine of Sultan Wais outside Kandahar. When Olaf Caroe wrote his book in 1958 (Caroe, pp.170–171), this relic was reported to be at Kabul Museum. The present status of this bowl is unknown.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} cricket <b>in</b> <b>Afghanistan</b> <b>is</b> of British troops playing a match in Kabul in 1839, though {{it appears that}} no long lasting legacy of cricket was left by the British. In the 1990s, cricket became popular amongst the Afghan refugees residing in Pakistan, and the Afghanistan Cricket Board was formed there in 1995. They continued to play cricket on their return to their home country. Like all sports, cricket was originally banned by the Taliban, but cricket became an exception in 2000 (being the only sport in Afghanistan {{to be approved by}} the Taliban) and the Afghanistan Cricket Federation was elected as an affiliate member of the ICC the following year.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue of}} {{national}} security {{is tied to the}} narcotics trade in Afghanistan; another report written by the Caucus in 2010 lists some recommendations on how to decrease the flow of opium from Afghanistan, and the money coming into the Taliban. With similar prescriptions as the Mérida Initiative, the United States is using DEA officers in conjunction with military personnel in Afghanistan to root out Taliban drug lords. The practice of eradication of the poppy crop only managed to drive farmers to side with the Taliban, as their livelihood was destroyed. The US is funding legitimate projects in Afghanistan in an attempt to get the work force out of the drug trade. The major issue <b>in</b> <b>Afghanistan</b> <b>is</b> corruption, the report estimates around $2.5 billion is doled out in bribes per year. How the US will continue to combat drug production, as they scale back their military presence in the coming years, remains to be seen.|$|E
