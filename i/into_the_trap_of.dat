500|$|Critics {{have noted}} {{homosexual}} undercurrents {{running through the}} film, particularly in Jacqueline's character and her relationship with Frances, a cult member who is an employee at the company she formerly owned. The film was featured in Turner Classic Movies Channel's Screened Out, which celebrated gay and lesbian themes in classic Hollywood cinema. Other film theorists, such as Harry M. Benshoff, author of Monsters in the Closet: Homosexuality and the Horror Film (1997), have read the film's anchoring of its Palladist characters in Greenwich Village—a neighborhood {{with a history of}} gay and lesbian residents—as another prominent undercurrent. In his assessment of the film, Benshoff notes: [...] "The Seventh Victim invokes the analogy in ways more sympathetic to homosexuality. While it could have easily fallen <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trap</b> <b>of</b> using gay and lesbian signifiers to characterize its villains (i.e. homosexual = Satanist, as did Universal's The Black Cat in 1934), the film is much more complex than that."

40|$|In this paper, {{we aim to}} {{understand}} whether current language and vision (LaVi) models truly grasp {{the interaction between the}} two modalities. To this end, we propose an extension of the MSCOCO dataset, FOIL-COCO, which associates images with both correct and "foil" captions, that is, descriptions of the image that are highly similar to the original ones, but contain one single mistake ("foil word"). We show that current LaVi models fall <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>traps</b> <b>of</b> this data and perform badly on three tasks: a) caption classification (correct vs. foil); b) foil word detection; c) foil word correction. Humans, in contrast, have near-perfect performance on those tasks.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{contrasts}} {{the notions}} of learning, teaching and development as these are conceptualized in two versions of constructivism: the socio-interactional one (in which Piagetian and Vygotskian insights are often merged) versus the one founded by Vygotsky and expanded in activity theory (especially by Galperin and Davydov). We reveal a broad conceptual commonality that makes these frameworks compatible at one level, but draw profound contrasts in their premises concerning history (including cultural tools) {{and the concept of}} the social. Examples of educational practices (including results of own year-long observation) are used to illustrate implications of these premises. We argue that the Vygotskian framework expanded by a dialectical view of history can be used to devise education that takes history to the fullest and yet does not fall <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>traps</b> <b>of</b> a conservative agenda with its two extremes of unidirectional authoritarianism or laissez-faire individualism.

40|$|In {{my thesis}} I develop {{a theory of}} our mental, {{physiological}} and emotional involvement with motion pictures that accounts for the distinct role of perception in our cinematic experiences. In particular, I present a (limited) resemblance view of cinematic perception and depiction that begins with an analysis of motion picture screenings as events {{in the world to}} which audience members share perceptual access and to which we can attribute complex visual and auditory properties. By understanding the precise nature of these properties and by understanding the mind's rich and dynamic relationship to visual and auditory stimuli, we can meet the demand of explaining the essential contribution of perception to our cinematic experiences. This positive theory is introduced through a philosophical and empirical critique of the work of several contemporary "cognitivist" film theorists who can been faulted for (i) falling <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>traps</b> <b>of</b> traditional illusion accounts, (ii) failing to account for the perceptual nature of our film experiences, or (iii) incorrectly characterizing the nature of our perceptual relationship to cinematic content...|$|R
