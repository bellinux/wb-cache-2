40|$|The {{problem of}} {{unwanted}} noise in buildings has grown continuously {{over the last}} twenty years and impact noise through separating floors has been identified as a particularly important problem. One accepted method for improving impact sound insulation is to use <b>floating</b> <b>floors</b> in which the walking surfaces are isolated from the supporting structure by a resilient layer. Traditionally the resilient layers comprise mineral or glass fibre quilts but other materials such as flooring grade polystyrene are increasingly used. Recently, shallow profile <b>floating</b> <b>floors</b> comprising flexible open cell polyurethane foam resilient layers have been developed. These systems are attractive for refurbishment projects since they can simply be placed on existing floors in order to improve their impact sound insulation whilst raising the existing floor level less than systems comprising fibre quilts. Shallow profile <b>floating</b> <b>floors</b> with thin layers of flexible open cell polyurethane foam are the subject of investigation as part of this research work. This thesis reviews the previous research on polyurethane foams and evaluates the usefulness of the Standard Tests on these materials for assisting in the selection of foam for use as resilient layers under lightweight floors. Both the static and dynamic behaviour of flexible open cell polyurethane foam are investigated and recycled polyurethane foam is shown to be particularly useful for use under <b>floating</b> <b>floors</b> Its characteristic behaviour under compressive strain is described for the first time. This thesis shows that by modifying the Standard Method for the determinaf on of the dynamic stiffness of resilient layers under <b>floating</b> <b>floors</b> (BS EN 29052 - 1), the effect of the air contained in the open cell foam specimens can be included in the Standard laboratory test. The modification makes it possible to evaluate the dynamic stiffness of low airflow resistivity resilient polyurethane resilient layers using the apparatus described in BS EN 29052 - 1 for the first time. Field measurements of impact sound pressure level conducted using sections of lightweight shallow profile <b>floating</b> <b>floor</b> on a concrete supporting floor are described. The measured improvements in impact sound insulation achieved by using the sections of <b>floating</b> <b>floor</b> are compared with the improvements predicted using the results from the modified Standard laboratory tests on the foams used as resilient layers. It is shown that by compensating for the mass impedance of the Standard tapping machine hammers good correlation between predicted and measured data is achieved. A simple method for predicting the weighted standardised impact sound pressure level (L'nT,w) in the receiving room is proposed which shows excellent correlation with L'nT,w obtained from the measured data. The work shows that BS EN 29052 - 1 is more widely applicable than the Standard itself states {{and for the first time}} identifies a method of predicting the performance of lightweight shallow profile <b>floating</b> <b>floors</b> with polyurethane foam resilient layers. Finally the use of the ISO tapping machine for assessing the impact sound insulation of the very lightweight <b>floating</b> <b>floors</b> of interest to this research is considered. Different methods of correlating perceived and measured the impact sound insulation of floors are reviewed.

30|$|Floor impact noises are {{considered}} as structure-borne sounds that {{are caused by}} either impacting on or vibrating directly on the structure, and then travelling through the entire building (Uno 1992). In general, one of the effective methods to lower the floor impact sounds is to separate or isolate the noise from its source. There {{are a number of}} approaches to lower the influence of floor impact noise, such as increasing the thickness of concrete slab, inserting sound absorptive materials, and creating space to isolate the sound sources. A number of studies point out {{that one of the most}} effective methods to separate the floor impact sounds in concrete structures is through the use of <b>floating</b> <b>floors</b> (Schiavi 2018; Miškinis et al. 2012; Martins et al. 2015; Faustino et al. 2012; D’alessandro et al. 2014; Sipari 2002). A <b>floating</b> <b>floor</b> is a combination of concrete slab and resilient, as well as sound absorbing, material, such as rubber (D’alessandro et al. 2014; Jeon et al. 2006; Schiavi 2018). Neves e Sopusa and Gibbs (2011) compared both homogeneous concrete <b>floors</b> and <b>floating</b> <b>floors</b> in dwellings. In their study, the <b>floating</b> <b>floor</b> would be beneficial to insulate low frequency impact sound transmission. Schiavi (2018) tested various resilient materials, such as glass fibre, polyester fibre, cork, and rubber grains, to form floating structures in the concrete slab. Cho (2013) indicated that the concrete slab with resilient layers would be useful to insulate floor impact sound, compared to the normal concrete slab. In this study, the voided slab system, which is filled with lightweight expanded polystyrene (EPS), is suggested as one of the <b>floating</b> <b>floor</b> systems to isolate and separate the floor impact sounds in a commercial–residential complex building. The EPS void formers were designed as a means of isolating floor impact sound in the concrete structure. In order to verify the usefulness and effectiveness of the voided slab systems for lightweight and heavyweight floor impact sound insulation, a field test was conducted to evaluate the sound insulation performance in the studied building.|$|R
