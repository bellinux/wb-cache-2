25|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, French New Wave critics, {{especially}} Éric Rohmer, Claude Chabrol and François Truffaut, {{were among the}} first to see and promote Hitchcock's films as artistic works. Hitchcock was one of the <b>first</b> <b>directors</b> to whom they applied their auteur theory, which stresses the artistic authority of the director in the filmmaking process. Hitchcock's innovations and vision have influenced a great number of filmmakers, producers, and actors. His influence helped start a trend for film directors to control artistic aspects of their films without answering to the film's producer.|$|E

He had worked with Lorraine Gary in 1973's The Marcus-Nelson Murders, for which he won his <b>first</b> <b>Directors</b> Guild of America Award. Indeed, Steven Spielberg cites this television film, that later spawned Kojak, as motivation for casting Gary as Ellen Brody in the original Jaws film, besides the fact she was {{the wife of the}} studio's chief executive Sidney Sheinberg at that time. In regards to Revenge, Gary remarked in an interview: [...] "I made a good deal on this film, but I didn't make as good a deal as I would have if I weren't married to Sid." ...|$|E
500|$|One of the <b>first</b> <b>directors</b> Kripke {{had become}} acquainted with and learned from was David Nutter. Kripke thus wanted to include homages to Nutter's work on the pilot; some scenes of the new reality {{were meant to be}} recreations from the first episode. The crew {{attempted}} to match the camera angles, lighting, and music as much as possible. While Sam and Jessica sleeping together in bed was supposed to be an exact replica of a similar scene, the fight between the brothers differed. Because the new Sam is [...] "pretty much a wussy", Dean is able to take him down instantly. Tucker noted that it was also a [...] "sneaky way" [...] of hinting that the new reality was merely an illusion, as he is [...] "re-experiencing that moment from the pilot because his fantasy world is being generated by what he already knows and has lived".|$|E

[...] Every talk seemed {{to lead to}} two or three more, and [...] "the response at New Age gatherings, community events, fairs, bookstores, living rooms, and college campuses" [...] kept Satin going for two years. [...] By the second year he began laying the groundwork for the New World Alliance, a national political organization based in Washington, D.C. [...] "I went systematically to 24 cities and regions from coast to coast", he told the authors of the book Networking. [...] "I stopped when I found 500 [...] people who said they'd answer a questionnaire … on what a New Age-oriented political organization should be like– what its politics should be, what its projects should be, and how its <b>first</b> <b>directors</b> should be chosen.".|$|E
500|$|Kubrick {{was among}} the <b>first</b> <b>directors</b> to use video assist during filming. At the time he began using it in 1966, it was {{considered}} cutting-edge technology, requiring him to build his own system. Having it in place during the filming of 2001, {{he was able to}} view a video of a take immediately after it was filmed. On some films, such as Barry Lyndon, he used custom made zoom lenses, which allowed him to start a scene with a close-up and slowly zoom out to capture the full panorama of scenery and to film long takes under changing outdoor lighting conditions by making aperture adjustments while the cameras rolled. LoBrutto notes that Kubrick's technical knowledge about lenses [...] "dazzled the manufacturer's engineers, who found him to be unprecedented among contemporary filmmakers". For Barry Lyndon he also used a specially adapted high-speed (f/0.7) Zeiss camera lens, originally developed for NASA, to shoot numerous scenes lit only with candlelight. Actor Steven Berkoff recalls that Kubrick wanted scenes to be shot using [...] "pure candlelight", and in doing so Kubrick [...] "made a unique contribution to the art of filmmaking going back to painting... You almost posed like for portraits." [...] LoBrutto notes that cinematographers all over the world wanted to know about Kubrick's [...] "magic lens" [...] and that he became a [...] "legend" [...] among cameramen around the world.|$|E
500|$|Fincher {{supervised}} {{the composition of}} the DVD packaging {{and was one of the}} <b>first</b> <b>directors</b> to participate in a film's transition to home media. The film was released in two DVD editions. The single-disc edition included a commentary track, while the two-disc special edition included the commentary track, behind-the-scenes clips, deleted scenes, trailers, fake public service announcements, the promotional music video [...] "This is Your Life", Internet spots, still galleries, cast biographies, storyboards, and publicity materials. The director worked on the DVD as a way to finish his vision for the film. Julie Markell, 20th Century Fox's senior vice president of creative development, said the DVD packaging complemented the director's vision: [...] "The film is meant to make you question. The package, by extension, tries to reflect an experience that you must experience for yourself. The more you look at it, the more you'll get out of it." [...] The studio developed the packaging for two months. The two-disc special edition DVD was packaged to look covered in brown cardboard wrapper. The title [...] "Fight Club" [...] was labeled diagonally across the front, and packaging appeared tied with twine. Markell said, [...] "We wanted the package to be simple on the outside, so that there would be a dichotomy between the simplicity of brown paper wrapping and the intensity and chaos of what's inside." [...] Deborah Mitchell, 20th Century Fox's vice president of marketing, described the design: [...] "From a retail standpoint, [...] has incredible shelf-presence." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{demanding}} perfectionist, Kubrick assumed {{control over}} most {{aspects of the}} filmmaking process, from direction and writing to editing, and took painstaking care with researching his films and staging scenes, working in close coordination with his actors and other collaborators. He often asked for several dozen retakes of the same scene in a movie, which resulted in many conflicts with his casts. Despite the resulting notoriety among actors, many of Kubrick's films broke new ground in cinematography. The scientific realism and innovative special effects of [...] (1968) were without precedent {{in the history of}} cinema, and the film earned him his only personal Oscar, for Best Visual Effects. Steven Spielberg has referred to the film as his generation's [...] "big bang", and it is {{regarded as one of the}} greatest films ever made. For the 18th-century period film Barry Lyndon (1975), Kubrick obtained lenses developed by Zeiss for NASA, to film scenes under natural candlelight. With The Shining (1980), he became one of the <b>first</b> <b>directors</b> to make use of a Steadicam for stabilized and fluid tracking shots. While many of Kubrick's films were controversial and initially received mixed reviews upon release—particularly A Clockwork Orange (1971), which Kubrick pulled from circulation in the UK following a mass media frenzy—most were nominated for Oscars, Golden Globes, or BAFTA Awards, and underwent critical reevaluations. His last film, Eyes Wide Shut, was completed shortly before his death in 1999 at the age of 70.|$|E
