50|$|In 1924 {{there was}} a plan to convert all the <b>hoppers</b> to O <b>type</b> <b>wagons</b> for coal traffic, running between Yallourn and Newport Power Station. Wagons 17, 28, 36, 39 and 46 were used as hopper-donors for wagons O 1 through 5, but the project was {{abandoned}} before any more wagons could be sacrificed.|$|R
5000|$|Wagon {{manufacturer}} Thrall (USA) reopened {{the plant}} as wagon works in 1997, having obtained about a £200 million order from EWS for 2,500 wagons. First production was the BYA type covered steel coil carriers. The first wagon was formally presented in July 1998. Nearly {{half of the}} order was for 1145 HTA coal <b>hoppers.</b> Other <b>wagon</b> <b>types</b> produced included 300 MBA 'monster box', 260 BYA (covered steel coil), 100+400+300 FAA; FCA and FKA container flat wagons, and 60 BRA steel wagons. Prototype MRA ballast wagons were also manufactured for Railtrack at the site [...]|$|R

French-style <b>hopper</b> <b>type</b> coal bunker were also fitted. By 1956 there were 57 V1 and 35 V3 types in service, many on Newcastle-Middlesbrough services.|$|R
50|$|Currently {{four types}} of trams are {{operating}} in Wrocław: Konstal 105Na, Protram 204 WrAs, Protram 205 WrAs, Škoda 16 T, Škoda 19 T, Pesa Twist and Moderus Beta. The 105N <b>type</b> <b>wagons</b> are subjected to various upgrades (and after the upgrade they are marked 105NWr).|$|R

50|$|They {{were built}} with Watson Standard no. 1 boilers, while their double <b>hopper</b> <b>type</b> ashpans were {{specially}} designed {{to clear the}} four-wheeled trailing bogies. Their specially designed Type MY tenders were similar in appearance to the Type MX and the North American Vanderbilt type tenders, with cylindrical water tanks. The tenders rode on three-axle Buckeye bogies to reduce the axle load and, along with the Type MX, became commonly known as Torpedo tenders.|$|R
50|$|A one-ton W300 light-duty/civilian <b>type</b> Power <b>Wagon</b> was {{released}} in 1958.|$|R
50|$|The inner firebox was {{of steel}} and was fitted with five 3 in {{diameter}} arch tubes, which supported the brick arch. The rocking grate, with two drop-grates, was actuated by a steam shaker. As was the practice with Watson Standard boilers, the <b>hopper</b> <b>type</b> ashpan was secured to the main frames instead of to the boiler foundation ring, with a 4 in air gap all round. Drench pipes were fitted to facilitate cleaning and {{the bottom of the}} ashpan was fitted with a hand-operated sliding door.|$|R

25|$|The CFC {{had over}} 500 freight wagons. Open wagons were on 10 tonnes capacity. Other <b>wagon</b> <b>types</b> {{included}} flat <b>wagons,</b> vans, tarpaulin wagons, tank and hopper wagons, {{as well as}} three cranes.|$|R
5000|$|The only {{remaining}} {{player in the}} market was Sentinel. In 1933, they launched their [...] "S" [...] <b>type</b> <b>wagons.</b> A fast, well thought out and reliable design, it was a valiant attempt to maintain the steam wagon market. Despite this, in 1938, production ceased, except for 100 wagons produced in the early 1950s for the Argentine government, and a solitary wagon produced for the home market.|$|R
50|$|In 1999 Freight Victoria, by {{then the}} {{operator}} of all Victorian freight trains, had expanded its grain operations to the Riverina areas of NSW; to facilitate this about 100 wagons from the post-1979 batches (selected fairly randomly) became VHAF; the new code represented their additional air-operated roof lids and discharge doors, operated by the main air-reservoir pipe (another group of ex JAF/X <b>type</b> <b>wagons</b> from the 1974 build also used this code).|$|R
5000|$|Its round-topped firebox {{was fitted}} with eight {{flexible}} cross-stays {{at the front}} end. The inner firebox was of steel instead of copper {{and it had a}} <b>hopper</b> <b>type</b> ashpan, fitted with an efficient arrangement of drench pipes. The ashpan doors were steam-operated with provision for hand operation when required. The finger bar fire grate was operated by two steam shaker cylinders and had two drop grates. The boiler pressure was [...] higher than that of the Class GE and it had a larger superheater area with 36 elements and incorporating a multiple valve regulator. The locomotive had a self-cleaning smokebox and was fitted with a spark arrester.|$|R
50|$|This {{group has}} a large variety of {{different}} <b>types</b> of <b>wagon</b> that range from the two-axle well wagon to the 36-axle Schnabel wagon.|$|R
50|$|As the H <b>type</b> <b>wagons</b> were withdrawn, more goods was {{transported by}} the {{alternative}} method of open wagons fitted with tarpaulins. However, {{by the mid}} 1950s this method had become unduly expensive, as tarpaulins were prone to regular damage from weather and improper staff handling practices, as well as simply wearing out. It was decided to recycle old steel underframes, using components from and a similar design to the then-new bogie boxvans, {{to create a new}} fleet of four-wheeled, all-steel boxvans.|$|R
50|$|In 1984, {{the last}} Rollböcke, the more {{primitive}} <b>type</b> of transporter <b>wagon</b> using forks {{to hold the}} standard-gauge wagon's axles, were replaced with Rollwagen, the more advanced <b>type</b> resembling a <b>wagon</b> with a short stretch of standard-gauge track onto which the standard-gauge wagon is fastened.|$|R

50|$|The German State Railway Wagon Association (Deutscher Staatsbahnwagenverband) or DWV was an {{association}} of the German state railways Länderbahnen founded in 1909. The purpose of the association was to guarantee the unrestricted exchange of goods wagons between the member railway administrations. The German State Railway Wagon Association could, unlike the Prussian State Railway Wagon Association, stipulate standard wagon designs {{for the whole of}} Germany. It developed a total of eleven different <b>wagon</b> <b>types,</b> the Verbandsbauart (literally: association <b>type)</b> or DWV <b>wagons.</b> In addition to entire goods <b>wagons,</b> <b>types</b> of bogie were also specified.|$|R

50|$|The main {{difference}} between the ordinary and special <b>types</b> of flat <b>wagon</b> is that the former always {{have to have a}} flat deck that can be driven on, whereas the special types {{do not have to be}} so designed. Within both <b>types</b> of flat <b>wagon,</b> there are variants with separate axles as well as bogie wagons.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are also}} many other <b>types</b> of <b>wagon,</b> such as [...] "low loader" [...] wagons or well wagons for {{transporting}} road vehicles. There are refrigerator cars for transporting {{foods such as}} ice cream. There are simple <b>types</b> of open-topped <b>wagons</b> for transporting minerals and bulk material such as coal, and tankers for transporting liquids and gases. Today, however, most coal and aggregates are moved in hopper wagons that can be filled and discharged rapidly, to enable efficient handling of the materials.|$|R

This photo was probably taken immediately after the unloading of the locomotive in 1915, with the ship in the background being the SS Ismailia which brought the railway and wireless station equipment out from Britain. The picture illustrates the two original <b>types</b> of <b>wagon,</b> a tipper on an inside bearing oval chassis seen on the left, and a flat wagon on a rectangular outside bearing chassis seen to the right.

50|$|In 1984 the ten {{remaining}} VHCA wagons ex J series hoppers (51, 53, 54, 81, 82 and 84-87) {{were removed}} from that fleet and reclassed to VHJA 1-10 for gypsum traffic. The covered roof was removed and replaced with a vertically extended box structure, hiding extended and steeper sloped sheets - like the VHLA, this was to assist in quick unloading, {{but in this case}} the extension was provided so that capacity was not lost in the process. In the late 1980s some of these wagons were seen in briquette traffic, but by 1993 there was clearly justification for the class as a further 15 VHCA (normal <b>type)</b> <b>wagons</b> were converted, bringing the new total to 25.|$|R
5000|$|During 1972 the Public Transport Commission {{advised the}} users of non-air coal wagons that {{they planned to}} ban the {{operation}} of these wagons to Port Waratah in the near future.

The PTC would still work non-air wagons from East Greta Junction to Hexham, but from Hexham onwards the trains had to consist of air braked wagons.|$|R
