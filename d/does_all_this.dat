25|$|Because {{of these}} romantic feelings, Bianca helps JR win Marissa back by {{suggesting}} romantic dates and gifts {{that he can}} give to Marissa. Bianca <b>does</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> because she realizes that Marissa may never reciprocate the same feelings for her. One of the gifts that Bianca gives to JR for Marissa is a music box. This music box plays a song that Marissa's adoptive father used to sing {{to her when she}} was a little girl. JR gives the music box to Marissa while at the park with the kids. While Marissa is listening to the music box, Bianca watches from afar how much Marissa enjoys the gift and walks away.|$|E
500|$|MSNBC's Patrick Enwright {{listed the}} episode as his ninth {{favorite}} in the show in 2007, saying it [...] "brilliantly skewers new-agey self-help gurus" [...] and adding that [...] "it's also noteworthy for clever pop-cultural references." [...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, described it as [...] "A very bizarre episode in which everyone just has a good time." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote: [...] "A certified classic, 'Child' mocks the self-help field and makes a good point along the way. Of course, it <b>does</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> with scads of clever moments and becomes a great show. As one who works in psychology, it's hard to resist this program's spoofery." [...] Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of B+ and described Homer's escapades with the trampoline as [...] "the episode's brightest spot." [...] Turner described the Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner homage as [...] "one of the show's most overt and inspired tributes to the Warner cartoons." [...] Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave the episode a score of 4.5 out of 5.|$|E
500|$|Reviews for [...] "Right Round" [...] {{were mostly}} negative. A {{reviewer}} for The New York Times called the song [...] "ionic and empty". In {{a review of}} R.O.O.T.S., Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe stated, [...] "His music is pure ear candy that must make Britney [...] envious, yet he wants to come off as a thug." [...] He continued that {{it is unlikely that}} [...] "Right Round" [...] would have gone over well in Brooklyn in the '80s, calling it [...] "as hard as Jell-O." [...] Alex Fletcher of Digital Spy stated in his review of the song, [...] "It's pretty difficult to ruin a pop classic, but Flo Rida gives it a pretty good stab here." [...] He added that [...] "Right Round" [...] is [...] "illed with more misogyny than a 1970s working mens' club", and called it [...] "an unpleasant affair that's only saved from the trashcan by its sample." [...] Fletcher concluded, [...] "The fuzzy synths, electro beats and infectious chorus hook sung by Kesha are almost enough to fool the casual listener into enjoying themselves. But sadly it's never too long before Flo Rida turns up again to spoil things." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly called the song [...] "a horrendous rap remake of Dead or Alive's 'You Spin Me Round (Like a Record).'" [...] Noting that the song was, at the time, the number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100, he added, [...] "What <b>does</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> say about us as a society? Mainly that we really, really enjoy cheesetastic '80s hair-pop hits in whatever form we can get 'em, I guess." ...|$|E

2500|$|Erica {{began to}} take on a larger-than-life role by the 1980s. This is evident with her writing an autobiography, [...] "Raising Kane", and turning it into a motion picture. When her presumed {{half-sister}} Silver (Deborah Goodrich) accuses her of murdering Kent Bogard (Michael Woods, Lee Godart), her former lover and boss, she goes on the run, fleeing to the Hollywood Hills. She <b>does</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> while posing as a nun.|$|E
2500|$|Gandhi and the Future of Economics (2011) [...] "makes a {{case for}} {{incorporating}} Gandhi's insights into mainstream economics. Gandhi and the Future of Economics {{is not meant to}} be a research study of Gandhian economics. It is rather that kind of felicitous publication that breathes new life into a known theme, and, in doing so, brings out its implications for praxis. It <b>does</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> in dialogue with a set of contemporary thinkers and actors from the Indian sub-continent: Jawaharlal Nehru, Jayaprakash Narayan, Tariq Ali, Vandana Shiva, Amartya Sen, Arundhati Roy, Manmohan Singh." [...] (...) [...]|$|E
2500|$|The {{attack on}} Nampala pushed the {{fighting}} {{far to the}} south. The President of Mali, Amadou Toumani Touré, vowed harsh action in a speech at Kayes: [...] "Enough is enough. We cannot continue to suffer, we cannot keep counting our dead... We cannot keep searching for peace... They are firing on anything that moves. They are firing on soldiers, they're firing on civilians, what <b>does</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> mean?" [...] He claimed that while Nampala had no strategic importance, it was [...] "close to the different routes and paths that take drugs across the Sahara-Sahel strip". This was a reiteration of the government contention that elements of the rebels were motivated not by political motives, but by their supposed involvement in the lucrative Saharan smuggling trade.|$|E

2500|$|... (12 June 2008) We {{completed}} our 2008 {{effort to}} get definitive evidence for ivorybills in the Choctawhatchee River Basin in early May…. Team members had no sightings of ivorybills and only two sound detections in 2008.… So where <b>does</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> leave us? Pretty much {{in the same position}} as in June 2006. We have a large body of evidence that Ivory-billed Woodpeckers persist along the Choctawhatchee River in the Florida panhandle, but we do not have definitive proof that they exist. Either the excitement of the ivorybill hunt causes competent birders to see and hear things that do not exist and leads competent sound analysts to misidentify hundreds of recorded sounds, or the few ivorybills in the Choctawhatchee River Basin are among the most elusive birds on the planet.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{electrification}} systems take AC {{energy from}} a power grid which is delivered to a locomotive and {{converted to a}} DC voltage {{to be used by}} traction motors. These motors may either be DC motors which directly use the DC or they may be 3-phase AC motors which require further conversion of the DC to 3-phase AC (using power electronics). Thus both systems are faced with the same task: converting and transporting high-voltage AC from the power grid to low-voltage DC in the locomotive. Where should this conversion take place and at what voltage and current (AC or DC) should the power flow to the locomotive? [...] And how <b>does</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> relate to energy-efficiency? [...] Both the transmission and conversion of electric energy involve losses: ohmic losses in wires and power electronics, magnetic field losses in transformers and smoothing reactors (inductors). [...] Power conversion for a DC system takes place mainly in a railway substation where large, heavy, and more efficient hardware can be used as compared to an AC system where conversion takes place aboard the locomotive where space is limited and losses are significantly higher. [...] Also, the energy used to blow air to cool transformers, power electronics (including rectifiers), and other conversion hardware must be accounted for.|$|E
