25|$|Despite {{his lack}} of learning, Trần Thủ Độ was praised as a skilled and devoted {{official}} of the Trần Dynasty, the ruling dynasty which was found by his very own effort. As a result, the <b>grand</b> <b>chancellor</b> held a position in royal court which was so powerful that he was suspected by some of overruling the Emperor. Once there {{was a person who}} went to the Emperor to report him about this suspicion, Thái Tông immediately visited Trần Thủ Độ's place with this man and made him tell everything in front of the <b>grand</b> <b>chancellor.</b> After hearing the story, Trần Thủ Độ not only accepted that the man had somewhat his reason but also awarded him for being concerned for the Trần Dynasty. His successful governing was considered by historical books as the main factor that not only led to the stability of Early Trần period but also contributed to the victory of Đại Việt over the first Mongol invasion.|$|E

25|$|Prince Trung Vũ Trần Thủ Độ (1194– 1264) was {{a general}} {{and leader of the}} Trần clan during the reign of Lý Huệ Tông and Lý Chiêu Hoàng in the kingdom of Đại Việt (now Viet Nam) and take a {{position}} as prime minister of Lý dynasty. Trần Thủ Độ was credited for overthrowing the Lý Dynasty and establishing the Trần Dynasty by his arrangement of marriage between the Empress Regnant Chiêu Hoàng and his nephew Trần Cảnh. After the coronation of Trần Cảnh, now Trần Thái Tông, Trần Thủ Độ was appointed <b>grand</b> <b>chancellor</b> and regent of the Emperor.|$|E
25|$|After the {{coronation}} of Trần Cảnh, now Trần Thái Tông, Lý Chiêu Hoàng was downgraded to Empress Consort Chiêu Thánh (Chiêu Thánh hoàng hậu) in January 1226. Although Trần Thừa, {{father of the}} new emperor, acted as Regent in the royal court, it was the <b>grand</b> <b>chancellor</b> Trần Thủ Độ who held absolute power in the court and decided both military and civil matters of the country. Still afraid that the newly founded rule of the Trần Dynasty might be overthrown by its political opponents, Trần Thủ Độ continued to eliminate members of the Lý royal family by his ruthless method. The <b>grand</b> <b>chancellor</b> ordered Lý Chiêu Hoàng's father, Lý Huệ Tông, to commit suicide on October 8 of Lunar calendar 1226 while married her mother Empress Trần Thị Dung, now Princess Thiên Cực. These actions of Trần Thủ Độ were criticized by Ngô Sĩ Liên in his Đại Việt sử kí toàn thư as an inhumane decision, despite his initial motive of reinforcing the reign of Trần Thái Tông. Not satisfied {{with the death of}} Huệ Tông, Trần Thủ Độ decided to kill off all members of the Lý royal family in August 1232 during the death anniversary of Lý emperors held in Thái Đường, Hoa Lâm (now Nam Trực, Nam Định). However, the authenticity of this event was challenged by the historian Ngô Sĩ Liên because a member of the Lý clan was still appointed as general by Trần Anh Tông and there was no account of this event in Phan Phu Tiên's historical record.|$|E
25|$|When the King traveled, Marshals {{supervised}} the local Voivodes. The Marshals decided {{who would be}} admitted to royal audience. They were the organizers and masters of royal and court ceremonies (including weddings, funerals and the like). They were the masters of the court, kept track of lesser courtiers, and (where applicable) set their salaries. Each Marshal wielded a marshal's staff, which he had received from the Chancellor (Kanclerz). In exchange, all Chancellor nominations were heralded by the Marshals. If no Marshal was present, his functions were carried out by a Grand Treasurer or secular <b>Grand</b> <b>Chancellor.</b> On formal occasions and during travel, where appropriate, a Marshal with his staff of office preceded the King. Close after the Marshals in the hierarchy were the Chancellors.|$|E

The Scriptors drafted the letters, the clerks prepared the final copies. The documents were also copied into books called [...] "Metryki" [...] (singular: Metryka), which were kept by two [...] "metrykants", each, in Poland and Lithuania. The <b>Grand</b> <b>Chancellor's</b> Metrykant was called the Grand Metrykant, the Subchancellor's was the Lesser Metrykant. The Chancelleries' staffs, like the Chancellors, received no wages, but the middle of each reception room featured a box into which clients were expected to deposit varying amounts of money, and no one who planned to return could afford to be stingy.|$|R

It had formed part of an overall redevelopment of the Wapping area, that had seen the old Metropolitan Transport Trust bus garages, lower Collins Street, and other buildings restored.|$|E

But because of the firm faith of the Emperor Thái Tông, <b>grand</b> <b>chancellor</b> Trần Thủ Độ and the talents of generals such as Prince Hưng Đạo Trần Quốc Tuấn and Lê Phụ Trần, the Trần dynasty was able to throw back the invasion and ultimately re-established the peace in Đại Việt in December 1257.|$|E
25|$|However we find, in the Blackwell {{papers in}} the National Library of Ireland that, in August 1816, by Royal Ordinance dated 24 July of that same year, Jacques Bartholomew Blackwell, Chef d’Escadron, was {{appointed}} Governor of La Petite Pierre.

His date of death remains a mystery; at best a speculation. It is likely however that his body is interned in Pere Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.|$|E

25|$|In 1261 {{at the age}} of only 20, Trần Quang Khải was {{appointed}} by Thánh Tông as minister instead of his elder brother Prince Tĩnh Quốc (Tĩnh Quốc Đại vương) Trần Quốc Khang because the Emperor considered Quốc Khang not capable for an important position in royal court. After the death of two grand chancellors: Trần Thủ Độ in 1264 and Trần Nhật Hiệu in 1269, Prince Chiêu Minh was promoted to this position in 1271 and thus became the most important official in the royal court. When Trần Nhân Tông succeeded Thánh Tông in 1278, Trần Quang Khải continued to take charge of administrative activities as <b>grand</b> <b>chancellor</b> while Trần Hưng Đạo was chosen as the grand commander of the Đại Việt army in 1283 to prepare for the threat from the Yuan Dynasty.|$|E
25|$|On 23 February, Hotel <b>Grand</b> <b>Chancellor,</b> Christchurch's tallest hotel, was {{reported}} {{to be on the verge}} of collapse. The 26-storey building was displaced by half a metre in the quake and had dropped by 1 metre on one side; parts of the emergency stairwells collapsed. The building was thought to be irreparably damaged and have the potential to bring down other buildings if it fell; an area of a two-block radius around the hotel was thus evacuated. The building was eventually stabilised and, on 4 March it was decided the building would be demolished over the following six months, so that further work could be done with the buildings nearby. Demolition was completed in May 2012. The 21-storey PricewaterhouseCoopers building, the city's tallest office tower, is among the office buildings to be demolished.|$|E
