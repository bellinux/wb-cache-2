On the contrary, a combination of tests seems to provide the most accurate diagnosis. For impingement, these tests include the Hawkins-Kennedy impingement sign in which the examiner medially rotates the patient's flexed arm, forcing the supraspinatus tendon against the coracoacromial ligament and so producing pain if the test is positive a positive painful arc sign, and weakness in external rotation with the arm at the side.|$|E
25|$|Hull {{was educated}} at a small, one room {{school in the}} village of Sickels where there were about twenty to thirty people. He often missed school to help work on the farm. He {{displayed}} an early proficiency for mathematics, but found grammar a bit difficult. When he was 11 or 12, he was forcibly converted by a religious group known as the Christian Crusaders. This experience caused him to rethink his religious identity, eventually renouncing religion entirely. At the age of 17, he passed a teacher's <b>examination</b> <b>test</b> and became a teacher in a similar small schoolhouse. A combination of his religious crisis and his experience teaching inspired him to seek further education. He attended a high school in west Saginaw County, living with the superintendent of schools in exchange for household chores. Hull's atheism almost caused the superintendent to kick him out, but his wife got him to reconsider. After completing high school, Hull left the superintendent, but kept in contact with him until his death.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, archeologists working in Northeast Arkansas for the Arkansas Archeological Survey began {{research}} into causes of Mississippi Valley potters' relatively sudden shift to shell temper. The team conducted {{research at the}} AAS Station Lab at Arkansas State University involving macroscopic, microscopic, petrographic thin-sections, atomic absorption and x-ray diffraction analyses. A member of the team, Michael G. Million, also conducted replicative experiments, perhaps the first to do so with the exact clays, tempers and tools used by prehistoric Mississippian potters. Pastes were created {{using a variety of}} temper-to-clay percentages so that vessels as well as test-tiles could be produced for <b>examination.</b> <b>Test</b> tiles gave information about the shrinkage rates of various clay/temper combinations to the 'green' state and then further information upon firing. Simple, round bottom cooking jars were built using coil construction and the Mississippian pottery tool set including a potteryanvil, wooden paddle, mussel shell scrapers and polishing stones. The research discovered that there were very good reasons for using shell tempering for Mississippi Valley clays. The nature of clays formed by such a large meandering river system are distinctive. The huge annually flooded backswamp areas create a clay which is composed of very minute clay particles (primarily silica) and a high proportion of organic content. This is caused by the slow settling or deposition of the alluvial materials after floods. The clay particles tend to measure just a few micrometres in size and in plate-like form. Large amounts of water can be tightly held in the interspace between the clay particles. Add to this the organic ooze, and one has what is known colloquially as [...] "gumbo" [...] clay.|$|E

40|$|Background An {{accurate}} {{physical examination}} {{of patients with}} patellar instability is {{an important aspect of}} the diagnosis and treatment. While previous studies have assessed the diagnostic accuracy of such physical <b>examination</b> <b>tests,</b> little has been undertaken to assess the inter- and intra-tester reliability of such techniques. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the inter- and intra-tester reliability of the physical <b>examination</b> <b>tests</b> used for patients with patellar instability. Methods Five patients (10 knees) with bilateral recurrent patellar instability were assessed by five members of the International Patellofemoral Study Group. Each surgeon assessed each patient twice using 18 reported physical <b>examination</b> <b>tests.</b> The inter- and intra-observer reliability was assessed using weighted Kappa statistics with 95 % confidence intervals. Results The findings of the study suggested that there were very poor inter-observer reliability for the majority of the physical tests, with only the assessments of patellofemoral crepitus, foot arch position and the J-sign presenting with fair to moderate agreement respectively. The intra-observer reliability indicated largely moderate to substantial agreement between the first and second tests performed by each assessor, with the greatest agreement seen for the assessment of tibial torsion, popliteal angle and the Bassett's sign. Conclusions For the common physical <b>examination</b> <b>tests</b> used in the management of patients with patellar instability inter-observer reliability is poor, while intra-observer reliability is moderate. Standardization of physical exam assessments and further study of these results among different clinicians and more divergent patient groups is indicated...|$|R
