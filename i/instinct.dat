5|$|Nintendo's stake {{purchase}} allowed Rare {{to expand}} significantly. The {{number of staff}} members increased from 84 to 250, and Rare moved out from their headquarters at the Manor Farmhouse. Rare also developed a CGI arcade fighting game, Killer <b>Instinct,</b> on their own custom-built arcade machine. Killer <b>Instinct</b> was set to be released for Nintendo's own 64-bit system, the Nintendo 64 in 1995, but was forced to release the game for the 16-bit SNES system, and had to downgrade the game's graphics. Killer <b>Instinct</b> sold 3.2 million copies, and {{was followed by a}} sequel, Killer <b>Instinct</b> 2. Killer <b>Instinct</b> Gold, the console version of Killer <b>Instinct</b> 2, suffered from a graphical downgrade due to the compression technology used to fit the arcade version onto the smaller Nintendo 64 cartridge.|$|E
5|$|Rare was a {{prominent}} second-party developer for Nintendo in the 1990s, and their Killer <b>Instinct</b> series was produced as an exclusive partnership {{in response to the}} popularity of Mortal Kombat. Following the success of the 1995 Killer <b>Instinct</b> port for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Rare began a sequel for the same platform but transitioned development to its successor, the Nintendo64, upon its unveiling. Gold was scheduled as a launch title for the new console but was delayed until its North American release in November 1996. It was released in other regions in May 1997. Gold was later included in Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the game}} began {{after the release of}} Killer <b>Instinct</b> 2, in which a team was split into making Killer <b>Instinct</b> Gold for the Nintendo 64 and a new racing game for that console. At its first stage of development, Diddy Kong Racing was {{conceived}} as a real-time strategy game with a caveman/time-travel theme worked on by a team of four Rare members; Chris Stamper, Lee Musgrave, Rob Harrison and Lee Schuneman. During later stages of development, the game became influenced by Walt Disney World and soon evolved into an adventure game called Wild Cartoon Kingdom, with which Nintendo had no involvement. In June 1997, the game was altered to Pro Am 64, an unrelated follow-up to the NES racing game R.C. Pro-Am. According to Schuneman, the Pro Am 64 project featured three-wheeled trikes in contrast to radio-controlled cars.|$|E

40|$|<b>Instincts</b> are innate, {{unconscious}} {{means by}} which Nature operates in all forms of life including animals and human beings. In humans however, with progressive evolution of consciousness, <b>instincts</b> become increasingly conscious and regulated by egoic functions. Biological <b>instincts</b> associated with the lower-unconscious such as survival, aggressive, and reproductive <b>instincts</b> are well known in general psychology. The higher-unconscious, which is unique to human beings, {{may be said to}} have its own instinctual processes referred to here as the ‘metaphysical instincts’. In traditional spiritual practices awakening the metaphysical <b>instincts</b> has often been done at the expense of suppressing the biological instincts—a process referred to as spiritual bypassing. This essay discusses how the metaphysical <b>instincts</b> initially expressed as the religious impulse with associated beliefs and behaviors may be transformed and made fully conscious, and integrated with the biological <b>instincts</b> in integral yoga and psychology in order to achieve wholeness of personality...|$|R
5|$|Guinea pigs are prey animals whose {{survival}} <b>instinct</b> is to mask {{pain and}} signs of illness, and many times health problems may not be apparent until a condition is severe or in its advanced stages. Treatment of disease is made more difficult by the extreme sensitivity guinea pigs have to most antibiotics, including penicillin, which kill off the intestinal flora and quickly bring on episodes of diarrhea and in some cases, death.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after filming Basic <b>Instinct</b> 2, {{he began}} work on The Reaping (2007) in Louisiana, in which he played science teacher Doug Blackwell {{opposite}} Hilary Swank. The role had been offered to him quite late in pre-production, and he flew to Baton Rouge the Monday after Basic <b>Instinct</b> 2 wrapped. He took the role {{because he was a}} fan of Swank, and Hopkins' film The Life and Death of Peter Sellers (2004), and he preferred the thriller aspect of the Reaping script above the horror aspect. After a week of filming, production had to be suspended when Hurricane Katrina hit the state. He found the filming schedule quite demanding, particularly the three weeks of night filming and a scene in which his character is attacked by a plague of locusts, most of which were computer-generated in post-production but some were real on camera. The Reaping was released in 2007 and performed badly in cinemas. Despite the failures of both films, Morrissey was grateful that they opened him up to more film offers from Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|In his popular books, he {{has argued}} that the human faculty for {{language}} is an <b>instinct,</b> an innate behavior shaped by natural selection and adapted to our communication needs. He is the author of seven books for a general audience. Five of these, The Language <b>Instinct</b> (1994), How the Mind Works (1997), Words and Rules (2000), The Blank Slate (2002), and The Stuff of Thought (2007), describe aspects of the field of psycholinguistics and cognitive science, and include accounts of his own research. In the sixth book, The Better Angels of Our Nature (2011), Pinker makes the case that violence in human societies has, in general, steadily declined with time, and identifies six major causes of this decline. His seventh book, The Sense of Style (2014), is intended as a general style guide that is informed by modern science and psychology, offering advice on how to produce more comprehensible and unambiguous writing in nonfiction contexts and explaining why so much of today's academic and popular writing is difficult for readers to understand.|$|E

5|$|Killer <b>Instinct</b> Gold is a 1996 {{fighting}} {{video game}} {{based on the}} arcade game Killer Instinct2. The game was developed by Rare and released by Nintendo for the Nintendo64 video game console. As in other series entries, players control characters who fight on a 2D plane set against a 3D background. Players press buttons to punch and kick their opponent in chains of successive hits, known as combos. Large combo successions lead to stronger attacks and brutal, stylistic finisher moves underscored by an announcer. Charactersincluding a gargoyle, a ninja, and a femme fatalefight in settings such as a jungle and a spaceship. Killer <b>Instinct</b> Gold includes the arcade release's characters, combos, and 3D, pre-rendered environments, but excludes its full-motion video sequences and some voiceovers due to restrictions of the cartridge media format. The Gold release adds a training mode, new camera views, and improved audiovisuals.|$|E
5|$|McCormack {{starred in}} the science-fiction film Alien Trespass (2009), in which he played Doctor Ted Lewis, who gets possessed by an alien marshal, Urp, after he crash-lands on Earth.

The film was critically and financially unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Pinker's 1994 The Language <b>Instinct</b> was {{the first}} of several books to combine {{cognitive}} science with behavioral genetics and evolutionary psychology. It introduces the science of language and popularizes Noam Chomsky's theory that language is an innate faculty of mind, with the controversial twist that the faculty for language evolved by natural selection as an adaptation for communication. Pinker criticizes several widely held ideas about language – that it needs to be taught, that people's grammar is poor and getting worse with new ways of speaking, the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis that language limits the kinds of thoughts a person can have, and that other great apes can learn languages. Pinker sees language as unique to humans, evolved to solve the specific problem of communication among social hunter-gatherers. He argues that it is as much an <b>instinct</b> as specialized adaptative behavior in other species, such as a spider's web-weaving or a beaver's dam-building.|$|E

5|$|The seven-person {{development}} team {{started work}} on the sequel with the ideas that did not fit into the original. They also incorporated feedback from Killer <b>Instinct</b> players. Killer Instinct2 art, design, and programming changed continuously throughout development up until its release. Kevin Bayliss designed the characters and Chris Tilston developed the game engine with feedback from Nintendo's Ken Lobb. Rare used compression technology to fit the arcade version onto the smaller Nintendo64 cartridge. While Killer <b>Instinct</b> was planned to showcase the Nintendo 64's power, the console was more limited than Rare's arcade setup, and Rare had to optimize the arcade version to run on the console. The arcade version used an animation to give the illusion of the camera panning horizontally, but the console version used static image files with less detail. Both the arcade and console versions use the same graphic engine and character roster.|$|E
5|$|Throughout history, {{mothers have}} been portrayed {{as the primary}} {{physical}} caregivers of children. Physical caregiving includes tasks such as breast-feeding and changing diapers. Some theorize that {{this has to do}} with the idea of women as having a natural <b>instinct</b> towards motherhood. Fathers, on the other hand, have been more likely to be portrayed in play activities with their children and are often more likely to be shown interacting with sons than daughters.|$|E
50|$|On April 8, 2004, Ubisoft {{announced}} Far Cry <b>Instincts</b> for the Xbox, GameCube and PlayStation 2 systems. Far Cry <b>Instincts</b> is not {{a direct}} port of the original, being designed specifically for consoles. The game uses a similar premise as the original PC version and same game engine, but by comparison, <b>Instincts</b> is less open-ended and more linear, due to the console's reduced processing power which prevents the full rendering of the PC version's vast islands and landscape. However, <b>Instincts</b> added new multiplayer modes, weapons, dual wielding and feral abilities, which is also added to the storyline. The PlayStation 2 and GameCube ports were later canceled. Far Cry <b>Instincts</b> was exclusive to the Xbox and was released to acclaim in North America on September 27, 2005.|$|R

5|$|Warning {{coloration}} {{can succeed}} either through inborn behaviour (<b>instinct)</b> {{on the part}} of potential predators, or through a learned avoidance.

5|$|A ninth {{game in the}} series, a reboot titled simply Mortal Kombat, was {{developed}} by former Midway Games Chicago, now owned by Warner Bros. Games and renamed as NetherRealm Studios.

5|$|Blue whale strandings are {{extremely}} uncommon, and, {{because of the}} species' social structure, mass strandings are unheard of. When strandings do occur, they can {{become the focus of}} public interest. In 1920, a blue whale washed up near Bragar on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. It had been shot by whalers, but the harpoon had failed to explode. As with other mammals, the fundamental <b>instinct</b> of the whale was to try to carry on breathing at all costs, even though this meant beaching to prevent itself from drowning. Two of the whale's bones were erected just off a main road on Lewis and remain a tourist attraction.|$|E

5|$|Development of {{the game}} began {{after the release of}} Killer <b>Instinct</b> 2, and was {{intended}} to be a real-time strategy game known as Wild Cartoon Kingdom during early stages. As time progressed, the game shifted from a Walt Disney World-influenced racing game to a unique title named Pro-Am 64, in which Nintendo had no involvement with. Due to the delays of Banjo-Kazooie, Rare felt that they needed a stronger intellectual property to attract a wider audience for a game scheduled to release before Christmas 1997, thus making the decision to revolve a game around the character of Diddy Kong.|$|E
5|$|Eyespots are {{a type of}} automimicry used by some lepidopterans. In butterflies, {{the spots}} are {{composed}} of concentric rings of scales of different colours. The proposed role of the eyespots is to deflect predators' attention. Their resemblance to eyes provokes the predator's <b>instinct</b> to attack these wing patterns.
