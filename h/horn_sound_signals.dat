40|$|The {{road traffic}} noise in Hanoi is {{characterized}} by a large number of motorbikes emitting frequent <b>horn</b> <b>sounds.</b> In order to cross-culturally investigate the effects of <b>horn</b> <b>sounds</b> on annoyance caused by road traffic noise, psychoacoustic experiments were conducted in Hanoi, Vietnam and Kumamoto, Japan. The annoyance caused by 12 types of road traffic noise with and without <b>horn</b> <b>sounds</b> was evaluated using two noise annoyance scales: an 11 -point numeric scale and a 5 -point verbal scale. The conditions and procedures of the experiments were the same in Hanoi and Kumamoto. The main findings are as follows: (1) the Vietnamese subjects were less affected by <b>horn</b> <b>sounds</b> than were the Japanese subjects; (2) the Japanese subjects were more annoyed by road traffic noise with <b>horn</b> <b>sounds</b> than that without horn sounds; (3) the Japanese subjects were generally more annoyed by road traffic noise than the Vietnamese subjects; and (4) differences between the characteristics of road traffic noise in Japan and Vietnam affected the annoyance of the Japanese subjects...|$|R

50|$|In 1617 a {{ship from}} Vlissingen whaling in <b>Horn</b> <b>Sound</b> had its cargo {{seized by the}} English vice-admiral.

40|$|Abstract: Recent {{studies have}} applied {{nonlinear}} analysis methods for heart sounds to diagnose {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD). Coronary artery occlusion may cause diastolic heart murmurs, so analysis of diastolic heart murmurs has important significance to noninvasive diagnosis of CAD. Heart <b>sound</b> <b>signal</b> is typical nonlinear and non-stationary time series, nonlinear analysis method- correlation dimension can effectively describe the nonlinear characteristics of heart <b>sound</b> <b>signals,</b> but {{the analysis of the}} correlation dimension shows that trend terms in the heart <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> may lead to erroneous results. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is adaptive to remove trend for non-stationary signal, so a method combining EMD and correlation dimension was proposed for nonlinear analysis of diastolic heart <b>sound</b> <b>signals.</b> The EMD method was applied to reconstruct heart <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> after removing trend, and the correlation dimension for reconstructed heart <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> was used as characteristics to distinguish between normal heart <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> and CAD heart <b>sound</b> <b>signals.</b> The diastolic heart sounds of 15 normal people and 15 patients with CAD were analyzed in the experiment, and the results showed that the proposed method can effectively distinguish between normal people and patients wit...|$|R

5000|$|Sound. Since a {{sound is}} a {{vibration}} of a medium (such as air), a <b>sound</b> <b>signal</b> associates a pressure value to every value {{of time and}} three space coordinates. A <b>sound</b> <b>signal</b> is converted to an electrical signal by a microphone, generating a voltage signal as an analog of the <b>sound</b> <b>signal,</b> making the <b>sound</b> <b>signal</b> available for further <b>signal</b> processing. <b>Sound</b> <b>signals</b> can be sampled at a discrete set of time points; for example, compact discs (CDs) contain discrete <b>signals</b> representing <b>sound,</b> recorded at 44,100 samples per second; each sample contains data for a left and right channel, which may {{be considered to be}} a 2-vector signal (since CDs are recorded in stereo). The CD encoding is converted to an electrical signal by reading the information with a laser, converting the <b>sound</b> <b>signal</b> to an optical signal.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{results of}} {{investigation}} {{on the relationship}} between emitted tool <b>sound</b> <b>signal</b> and tool flank wear during turning process are reported. A series of experiments were conducted in a turning machine with carbide tool insert for machining Aluminum work piece. The tool emitted <b>sound</b> <b>signal</b> with a fresh tool, a slightly worn tool with 0. 2 mm flank wear and a severely worn tool with 0. 4 mm flank wear were captured separately using ICP microphone. The captured <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> were analyzed using Hilbert Huang Transform (HHT) and the instantaneous frequencies and amplitudes of the <b>sound</b> <b>signal</b> components were obtained. The RMS values of the amplitudes of the Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) corresponding to the three different tool <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> were analyzed. Hilbert spectrum and marginal spectrum of selected IMFs of fresh, slightly worn and severely worn tool <b>sound</b> <b>signals</b> were obtained and analyzed.
