5|$|Self-managed work teams (also {{referred}} to as autonomous work groups) allow their members to make a greater contribution at work and constitute a significant competitive advantage for the organization. These work teams determine <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> accomplish the objectives they are mandated to achieve and decide what route they will take to complete the current assignment. Self-managed work teams are granted the responsibility of planning, scheduling, organizing, directing, controlling and evaluating their own work process. They also select their own members and evaluate the members' performance. Self-managed work teams have been favored for their effectiveness over traditionally managed teams due their ability to enhance productivity, costs, customer service, quality, and safety.|$|E

5|$|Fishermen of the Canary Islands had {{to return}} to and remain in port for several days while {{weathering}} the storm, and this disruption was blamed for a 10–15% reduction of the islands' tuna catch. Tropical Storm Delta also had some further-reaching effects. The political opposition Popular Party challenged that the impact of Tropical Storm Delta proved the need for the island to prepare an emergency plan to deal with natural and man-made disasters. Only five of the island's many municipalities had an emergency plan, and there was no coordination across the entire island chain. Delta also served to highlight the islands' aging power grid, prompting the regional director general of industry and energy to consider building another power plant on the archipelago. The storm sparked a vigorous debate on the island about the effects of global climate change, <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> affect the islands, and how these effects can be avoided.|$|E

When Ben explains {{they will need to}} slash the budget of every department by nearly 40 or 50 percent, Leslie angrily lashes out at Ben, who responds to her that the poorly managed government is to blame. Later, at April's party, Tom desperately tries to pick up women, but to no avail, while Leslie and Ann get extremely drunk together. Andy and April appear to be getting along, but when he goes to the bar to get a drink for April, a drunken Ann flirts with him. An upset April flirts with Tom's annoying friend Jean-Ralphio (Ben Schwartz) to make Andy jealous. Andy gets upset, believing he misread April's signals all along, and April later regrets what she did. Ben arrives at the party and tries to smooth things out with a drunken Leslie, but she again angrily lashes out at him.|$|E

The people who interact with them may have little or no training in robotics, and so any interface will need to be extremely intuitive. Science fiction authors also typically assume that robots will eventually be capable of communicating with humans through speech, gestures, and facial expressions, rather than a command-line interface. Although speech would be the most natural way for the human to communicate, it is unnatural for the robot. It will probably {{be a long time before}} robots interact as naturally as the fictional C-3PO, or Data of Star Trek, Next Generation.|$|E
