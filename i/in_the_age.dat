40|$|The {{research}} goal is {{to study}} probability, period of development and characteristics of a clinical course of chronic prostatitis {{against the background of}} androgen deficiency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> male. Materials and methods: <b>The</b> <b>Aging</b> Male Symptoms (AMS) rating scale has been applied for androgen deficiency evaluation and the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) — for chronic prostatitis evaluation. 57 men with chronic prostatitis in combination with androgen deficiency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> male have been examined. Results: It has been concluded that the development of chronic prostatitis against the background of androgen deficiency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> male occurs <b>in</b> a shorter time period and about 1. 5 times more frequently compared to androgen deficiency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> male at <b>the</b> background of chronic prostatitis. The analysis of time periods between the onset of chronic prostatitis symptoms against the background of androgen deficiency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> male and androgen deficiency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> male symptoms against the background of chronic prostatitis showed that androgen deficiency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> male symptoms have been revealed 1 - 2 years earlier than the onset of chronic prostatitis. The development of androgen deficiency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> male against <b>the</b> background of chronic prostatitis has showed a backward tendency. Signs of chronic prostatitis have been more frequently occurred in a period of four-five years earlier <b>the</b> androgen deficiency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> male development. Conclusion: The risk of development of chronic prostatitis against the background of androgen deficiency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> male during <b>the</b> next two years is actually four times higher <b>in</b> comparison with <b>the</b> development of androgen deficiency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> male against <b>the</b> background of chronic prostatitis. According to the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), patients with chronic prostatitis in combination with androgen deficiency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> male showed higher degree of severity than patients with isolated development of chronic prostatitis...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} hypoplastic anemia (HA) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aged,</b> {{clinical and}} hematological findings of 88 patients with HA were analyzed. The patients were classified into 4 groups according to age (Group A : 5 - 24 y/o, Group B : 25 - 44 y/o, Group C : 45 - 64 y/o and Group D : 65 y/o-). Hematological findings {{of patients in}} Group D were also compared to those of aged patients (above 65 y/o) with myelodisplastic syndrome (MDS) to clarify differentiation of HA from MDS. Items studied were severity, therapeutic response, complications, hematological findings, survival period and cause of death. The following results were obtained : 1. HA <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aged</b> was frequently severe. 2. Responses to therapies including anabolic steroids and corticosteroids tended to be poor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aged</b> compared to those in younger patients. 3. Infections and diabetes mellitus were frequently observed complications <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aged.</b> 4. Mortality <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aged</b> was higher than that in younger patients. 57. 1 % of <b>the</b> <b>aged</b> died from bleeding. 5. The survival period of patients in Group C and D was shorter than that of patients in Group A and B. 6. Red blood cell count, reticulocytes and hemoglobin level <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aged</b> were significantly lower than those in younger patients. Neutrophil and monocyte counts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aged</b> tended to be lower than those in younger patients. Nucleated cell counts and percentages of granulocytes and erythroblasts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> marrow were also lower <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aged.</b> 7. <b>The</b> incidence of atypical hematological findings in HA were not different between <b>the</b> <b>aged</b> and younger patients. 8.

40|$|When we {{evaluated}} <b>the</b> age-associated changes <b>in</b> autoimmune exocrinopathy in a NFS/sld murine model for primary Sjögren’s syndrome (SS), severe destructive autoimmune lesions developed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> salivary and lacrimal glands <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aged</b> mice, {{compared with those}} observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> younger model. We detected a decreased secretion of saliva and tear flow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aged</b> group. A significant increase of TUNEL+-apoptotic epithelial duct cells <b>in</b> <b>the</b> salivary glands was detected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aged</b> SS animal model. A higher proportion of mouse salivary gland cells bearing Fas was found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aged</b> group, whereas no significant changes were seen on tissue-infiltrating CD 4 + T cells bearing FasL <b>in</b> <b>the</b> salivary glands from young and aged mice. We detected an increased cleavage product of organ-specific autoantigen, 120 -kd α-fodrin, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aged</b> salivary gland tissues on immunoblotting, {{and an increase in}} serum autoantibody production against 120 -kd α-fodrin by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. An increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> proliferative response of splenic T cells against organ-specific autoantigen was observed, whereas nonspecific concanavalin A responsiveness was decreased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aged</b> mice. <b>In</b> addition, a decrease in Fas expression was found on splenic CD 4 + T cells <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aged</b> mice, and anti-Fas mAb-stimulated apoptosis was down-regulated on CD 4 + T cells. These results indicate that age-associated dysregulation of CD 4 + T cells may play a crucial role on acceleration of organ-specific autoimmune lesions in a murine model for primary SS through Fas-mediated apoptosis...|$|R

The game can be won through military conquest, by constructing a special building known as a Wonder and keeping it standing for {{a certain amount of}} time, or by obtaining control of all relics on the map for a set amount of time. Deathmatch mode allows players to begin with large amounts of resources, creating a focus on military dominance, while in the regicide mode each player is given a king unit, winning by killing all of the other monarchs.|$|E
