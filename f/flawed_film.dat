50|$|Virtual DVD Magazine offered {{that the}} film would be {{appreciated}} by lovers of B-movie science fiction, but that its low-quality CGI visuals would require getting used to.

5000|$|Film critic Dennis Schwartz {{gave the}} film a mixed review, writing, [...] "The <b>flawed</b> <b>film</b> never settles {{into a dark}} and {{sinister}} mood (filmed in a Hollywood studio) but succeeds only in keeping things tension-free and lighthearted with continuous breezy comical conversations as Ball does a sturdy Nancy Drew turn at sleuthing with her comical detective partner Zucco (who knew the usually typecast villain could be so amusing!). It can't quite measure up to compelling film noir, but it's pleasing and easy to handle despite everything feeling so contrived and confining." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Stepfather has an 86% {{approval}} rating from Rotten Tomatoes {{and an average}} rating of 6.7/10 out of 29 reviews.

5000|$|Brett Cullum of DVD Verdict wrote, [...] "For curious Dracula fans, Jess Franco's Count Dracula is a neat find.

Lee comes off fiery and committed to making this Count one that will be noticed." [...] Brian Lindsey of Eccentric Cinema wrote, [...] "Upon weighing film's pros and cons, Count Dracula emerges a substantially <b>flawed</b> <b>film.</b> But I can still recommend it to any fan of Lee, Franco, Miranda, and even of Stoker's novel." [...] George R. Reis of DVD Drive-In wrote, [...] "Count Dracula is flawed in many ways, but for fans of gothic horror, it’s still irresistible ... Barcelona naturally allows for some truly handsome scenery and an appropriate castle for Dracula to dwell in, and the performances of the international cast are above average." ...|$|E
50|$|Jewison {{noted in}} his {{autobiography}} that the <b>film's</b> <b>flaw</b> was that the script assumes that an artist's death guarantees a huge increase in the sales value of his paintings. That hurt audiences' responses to the movie enormously.|$|R

[...] Rolling Stone also spoke highly of Whitaker writing that his [...] "reflective, powerfully understated performance...fills this <b>flawed</b> <b>film</b> with potency and purpose." [...] Variety wrote that [...] "Daniels develops {{a strong sense of}} the inner complexities and contradictions of the civil-rights landscape." [...] USA Today gave the film three out of four stars and noted that [...] "It's inspiring and filled with fine performances, but the insistently swelling musical score and melodramatic moments seem calculated and undercut a powerful story."

5000|$|Colin Jacobson {{wrote in}} his review of the movie for the DVD Movie Guide: [...] "Probably the biggest {{criticism}} one can level at and Minds stems from its editorial bent.

[...] In his review, David Ng of the online Images: A Journal of Film and Popular Culture wrote: [...] "The documentary is clearly anti-war in both tone and content." [...] M. Joseph Sobran, Jr. of the conservative magazine National Review, wrote: [...] "... blatant piece of propaganda ... disingenuously one-sided ..." [...] {{and goes on to}} show the cinematic techniques used by the producers to achieve this effect. Stefan Kanfer of Time magazine notes that [...] "Throughout, Hearts and Minds displays more than enough heart. It is mind that is missing.

5000|$|Chaplin biographer Jeffrey Vance, {{writing in}} 2003, {{believes}} A King in New York {{to be an}} important film within Chaplin's body of work. He concludes his lengthy examination of the film with the statement, [...] "Although A King in New York targets the social and political climate of the 1950s, its satiric commentary is timeless. Despite its <b>flaws,</b> the <b>film</b> remains a fascinating study of life in America through the eyes of its most famous exile".|$|R
5000|$|Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN {{gave the}} movie 1.5 stars out of 5, noting that [...] "Ambitious but seriously <b>flawed,</b> the <b>film</b> smacks of laziness in {{virtually}} all departments, and even Karisma Kapoor's earnest performance can't save the day. I'm going with one-and-a-half out of five for director Vikram Bhatt's 'Dangerous Ishq'. Plodding on for close to two hours and thirty minutes, this film will make you wish you'd knocked back a stiff one before taking your seat." ...|$|R
500|$|Keith Baxter {{compared}} Welles to Falstaff, {{since they}} were both perpetually short of money, often lied and cheated people {{to get what they}} needed and were always merry and fun loving. Film scholar Jack Jorgens also compared Welles to Falstaff, stating that [...] "to a man who directed and starred in a masterpiece and has since staggered through three decades of underfinanced, hurried, <b>flawed</b> <b>films,</b> scores of bit parts, narrations, and interviews which debased his talent, dozens of projects which died for want of persistence and financing, the story of a fat, aging jester exiled from his audience and no longer able to triumph over impossible obstacles with wit and torrential imagination might well seem tragic." [...] When Joss Ackland played Falstaff on the stage in 1982, {{he said that he was}} more inspired by Welles than by Welles's performance as Falstaff, stating that [...] "like Falstaff, I believe he could have achieved so much, but it was frittered away." [...] Kenneth S. Rothwell has called Hal's rejection of Falstaff allegorical to Hollywood's rejection of Welles. Welles had become deeply depressed in the late 1950s after the disappointment of making Touch of Evil, his intended Hollywood comeback.|$|R
5000|$|Conversely, Peter Debruge of Variety gave a {{negative}} review, saying, [...] "To watch John Carter is to wonder where in this jumbled space opera one might find the intuitive sense of wonderment and awe Stanton brought to Finding Nemo and WALL-E". Owen Glieberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a D rating, feeling, [...] "Nothing in John Carter really works, since {{everything in the}} movie has been done so many times before, and so much better". Christy Lemire of The Boston Globe wrote that, [...] "Except for a strong cast, a few striking visuals and some unexpected flashes of humor, John Carter is just a dreary, convoluted trudge - a soulless sprawl of computer-generated blippery converted to 3-D". Michael Philips of the Chicago Tribune rated the film 2 out of 4 stars, saying the film [...] "isn't much - or rather, it's too much and not enough in weird, clumpy combinations - {{but it is a}} curious sort of blur". Andrew O'Herir of Salon.com called it [...] "a profoundly <b>flawed</b> <b>film,</b> and arguably a terrible one on various levels. But if you’re willing to suspend not just disbelief but also all considerations of logic and intelligence and narrative coherence, it’s also a rip-roaring, fun adventure, fatefully balanced between high camp and boyish seriousness at almost every second". Mick LaSelle of San Francisco Chronicle rated the film 1 star out of 4, noting, [...] "John Carter is a movie designed to be long, epic and in 3-D, but that's as far as the design goes. It's designed to be a product, and it's a flimsy one".A.O. Scott of The New York Times said, [...] "John Carter tries to evoke, to reanimate, a fondly recalled universe of B-movies, pulp novels and boys’ adventure magazines. But it pursues this modest goal according to blockbuster logic, which buries the easy, scrappy pleasures of the old stuff in expensive excess. A bad movie should not look this good".|$|E

5000|$|Iskandar Liem of the Jakarta Post wote {{that the}} film might have seemed to simply be a remake of the earlier Cinta, using notable stars {{as a means of}} {{attracting}} money at the box office, but offered that [...] "despite its <b>flaws,</b> <b>film</b> proves to be an emotional reflection on affairs of the heart. Speaking toward the work of Sophan Sophiaan in the film, Liem wrote it was [...] "refreshing to see senior thespian Sophan venturing outside his usual stern patriarchal roles with his touching portrayal of vulnerability." [...] He acknowledged the work of Widyawati, Sophiaan's real-life wife, in her role as Lestari, writing [...] "her character's generosity of spirit genuinely glows from her". He shared that of the cast, the work of Acha Septriasa was a [...] "standout performance", writing [...] "her performance is so fluid and organic, it's hard to believe this is the same grating actress who shamelessly turned on the waterworks in Love is Cinta".

50|$|In the Land of the Head Hunters {{has often}} been {{discussed}} as a <b>flawed</b> documentary <b>film.</b> The film combines many accurate representations of aspects of Kwakwaka'wakw culture, art, and technology from the era {{in which it was}} made with a melodramatic plot based on practices that either dated from long before the first contact of the Kwakwaka'wakw with people of European descent or were entirely fictional.

50|$|The title {{character}} is the merchant Antonio (Jeremy Irons), not the Jewish moneylender Shylock (Al Pacino) {{who is the}} more prominent character. This adaptation follows the text, but omits much.

50|$|The {{film was}} met with {{critical}} acclaim in Thailand, and was also well received internationally. Critics praised the film's concept and design, which tackled a familiar, mundane subject {{and turned it into}} an exciting caper thriller—something never before seen in Thai cinema.

Praise was also given to the editing and the script—many noted the film's subtle critique of Thai society's inequality issues and problems with its education system—although some found fault with the ending and the somewhat far-fetched plot.
