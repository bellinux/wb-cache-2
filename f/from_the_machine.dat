5|$|In 1928, {{a man in}} Portland, Oregon, invented an {{electric}} pancake machine that operated {{by the process of}} batter being dropped onto a revolving heated flattop grill from a storage cylinder atop the grill. The grill was heated using electricity. The amount of batter dropped was controlled by using controlled amounts of compressed air, which pushed batter out of the storage cylinder. As the batter revolved on the hot grill, the pancake was flipped halfway through the cooking process by a shelf atop the grill. After being flipped, the completed pancake was ejected <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> upon contact with a gate.|$|E

5|$|In America, Angier meets {{scientist}} Nikola Tesla {{and asks}} him to build him the machine Tesla built for Borden. While waiting for Tesla to finish, Angier deciphers Borden's diary, which he discovers to be fraudulent: Borden confesses that Tesla {{has nothing to}} do with Borden's trick and that Borden ordered Olivia to give Angier the diary to send him away. Angier confronts Tesla, who admits to never having built any device for Borden but has successfully built a replicating machine for Angier, capable of reproducing animate and inanimate objects a distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine.</b> As Tesla departs, he advises Angier to destroy the machine.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{broaching}} is more involved. The {{process begins}} by clamping the workpiece into a special holding fixture, called a workholder, which mounts in the broaching machine. The broaching machine elevator, {{which is the}} part of the machine that moves the broach above the workholder, then lowers the broach through the workpiece. Once through, the broaching machine's puller, essentially a hook, grabs the pilot of the broach. The elevator then releases the top of the pilot and the puller pulls the broach through the workpiece completely. The workpiece is then removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> and the broach is raised back up to reengage with the elevator. The broach usually only moves linearly, but sometimes it is also rotated to create a spiral spline or gun-barrel rifling.|$|E

5|$|The M15 {{was first}} used during Operation Torch, the November 1942 Anglo-American {{invasion}} of North Africa. Tracer ammunition <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> guns was used to bring the main gun onto the target when engaging enemy aircraft. T28E1 crews shot down {{more than a hundred}} aircraft during Operation Torch, the Battle of Kasserine Pass, and the Allied Invasion of Sicily, shooting down thirty-nine at Kasserine alone. One T28E1 was captured at Kasserine by the Germans and rebuilt as an equipment and troop carrier to replace vehicles destroyed by Allied aircraft. During the Allied Invasion of Sicily, 78 T28E1s helped provide anti-aircraft fire for the invasion force. They were especially effective against low-flying aircraft, like Stuka dive bombers. T28E1s were used in Italy {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Australian Army {{moved away}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> gun {{battalion}} concept and no similar units were raised. The machine gun role was subsumed into the support companies of individual infantry battalions. The idea was arguably misunderstood by Australian commanders {{throughout the war}} and this may have influenced the decision {{to move away from}} the concept. When the units had been established, the intent had been for machine gun battalions to provide highly mobile fire support but this only worked where the principles of open warfare worked. Once the focus of Australian Army combat operations shifted to the Pacific, the machine gun battalions were largely misused, being employed in a static defensive capacity against short and medium range targets or for menial tasks, rather than as offensive weapons for long range fire support. The medium machine guns were also largely used in the same manner as light machine guns, such as the Bren. Other reasons identified for the concept's limited use include distrust of overhead fire by some commanders, a preference for organic fire support over attached sub-units, over-estimating the difficulty of transporting Vickers guns in the jungle and a tendency to ignore targets that could not be seen. The difficulties of target acquisition in dense jungle also contributed.|$|E

25|$|For its part, the 5th Machine Gun Battalion was re-raised in September 1942 {{amidst the}} {{backdrop}} of the Japanese advance in the Pacific and fighting in New Guinea. Formed as a Militia unit, it drew its personnel <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> gun companies originally assigned to the 33rd, 45th, 46th, 52nd and 59th Infantry Battalions. When it was re-raised in 1942, the 5th Machine Gun Battalion adopted a new colour patch: a black, green and gold triangle. It subsequently undertook garrison duties as part of Torres Strait Force until being disbanded in May 1944. At the end of that war, {{the decision was made to}} return machine guns to the establishment of individual infantry battalions. Consequently, since then no further machine gun battalions have been raised as part of the Australian Army.|$|E
25|$|The {{explosives}} fail to {{kill the}} rabbits, and that night they attack Cole's ranch, killing Jud while Cole, Frank, Jackie, and Cole's housekeeper escape into the storm shelter. The rabbits {{make their way to}} the general store, killing housekeeper Mildred (Francesca Jarvis) and eating everybody else in the small town of Galanos they find before taking refuge in the buildings for the day. In the morning, Gerry and Amanda leave to avoid the coming press but get stuck along a sandy stretch of road. Roy and Elgin update Sheriff Cody (Paul Fix) on the situation and, after realizing the rabbits have escaped the mine, call in the National Guard. As night falls, the rabbits leave Galanos to continue the rampage, making their way to the main town of Ajo and eating and killing everybody in their pathway. Cole proposes using a half-mile wide stretch of electrified railroad track as a fence to contain and kill the rabbits. They recruit a large group of people at a drive in theater to help herd the rabbits with their car lights, with assistance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine</b> gun fire of the National Guard.|$|E
25|$|Eight EEF {{aircraft}} {{conducted an}} air raid on Jerusalem, on 26 June, bombing the Ottoman Fourth Army headquarters on the Mount of Olives. As the aircraft were flying home, first {{the engine of}} a B. E. aircraft seized, followed by another southeast of Beersheba. After successfully picking up the airmen from the first aircraft, which was destroyed, the attempted rescue of the second led to two aircraft being wrecked and three survivors walking across No Man's Land {{to the safety of}} a light horse outpost line. Two aircraft overflying the survivors on their walk ran out of petrol and oil near Khalasa. The pilots left their intact aircraft, hoping to return to salvage them. Three Australian Flying Corps officers walked in to Goz Mabruk post from southwest of Esani at 15:00 on 26 June after their forced landings, and the 3rd Light Horse Brigade was ordered to retrieve the two aircraft. The aircraft were located near Naga el Aseisi, southwest of Bir el Asani, and a regiment of the 5th Mounted Brigade was sent to guard the aircraft, during the night of 26/27 June. Under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Maygar, the 8th and 9th Light Horse Regiments (3rd Light Horse Brigade) with three troops <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Machine</b> Gun Squadron, one Section Field Ambulance and a detachment from the RFC, moved out from Tel el Fara at 03:30 to retrieve the aircraft on 27 June. They travelled across sand hills, with intervening areas of hard ground, to take over from the regiment of the 5th Mounted Brigade at 08:00. A bag of tools and a sketch showing the places where the two machine guns, camera, and ammunition had been buried near the Martinsyde, were dropped at 07:30 from an aircraft which flew out from Deir el Belah airfield. The guns, camera and ammunition had been dug up by Bedouin during the night. Both aircraft were badly damaged, except for the engines which were salvaged.|$|E

500|$|Beyondte Technology, {{based in}} Shenzhen Province, China, began {{development}} of the Robo French fry machine in 2008, which delivers hot French fries in around 95 seconds. Beyondte Technology was acquired by Breaktime Solutions in Belgium. The machine was developed by Belgian entrepreneurs, and field tested in Brussels, Belgium {{during the summer of}} 2012. The machine weighs 750 pounds, and can cook French fries in beef fat or cooking oil. Breaktime Solutions adapted the machine to operate using beef fat, the development of which took a year. It requires manual servicing and cleaning after around 150 orders are prepared. Later developments included installation of a ventilation system that uses three filters to reduce odors emitting <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>machine.</b> The New York Post has referred to the Robo French fry machine as the [...] "Rolls Royce of vending machines."
