2500|$|According {{to prison}} officials, Fenton {{had made the}} [...] "ice picks" [...] from metal <b>guide</b> <b>bars</b> on his typewriter. He was cited for [...] having a 15-inch {{sharpened}} steel rod, complete with a plastic handle, hidden under his pillow in his cell. Fenton said he was motivated to attack out of anger at Devlin's crimes. Investigation of the assault is ongoing and Fenton may face charges related to the attack. Devlin's security has been a concern for state prison officials since his arrest. Officials contemplated sending him out of state or providing him with a new identity. However, some victims' family members objected to the move, and the plan was dropped.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few lines}} of the Paris Métro in France operate on a four-rail power scheme. The trains move on rubber tyres which roll {{on a pair of}} narrow roll ways made of steel and, in some places, of concrete. Since the tyres do not conduct the return current, the two <b>guide</b> <b>bars</b> {{provided}} outside the running 'roll ways' become, in a sense, a third and fourth rail which each provide 750 V DC, so at least electrically it is a four-rail scheme. Each wheel set of a powered truck carries one traction motor. A side sliding (side running) contact shoe picks up the current from the vertical face of each guide bar. The return of each traction motor, as well as each wagon, is effected by one contact shoe each that slide on top of each one of the running rails. This and all other rubber-tyred metros that have a [...] track between the roll ways operate in the same manner.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This paper {{conducts a}} {{comprehensive}} {{study on the}} optimization design for crank arc <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> gathering mechanism of crab claw type loading machine. The optimization aim is to make reality locus of gathering claw end-point be as in-accordance as possible with ideal locus, and so on. Formulae are derived for displacement of gathering claw end-point and position angle of the gathering claw. An optimization design model is established for the crank arc <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> gathering mechanism. The crank arc <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> gathering mechanism is optimized of crab claw type loading machine with 2100 mm wide, and the optimization result is satisfactory. Compared to the optimized crank straight line <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> gathering mechanism in literature [2], the locus error function of gathering claw end-point has been largely improved with a reduction of 25. 8 %...|$|R

60|$|He had {{aimed at}} {{the body of the}} aeroplane, but at the very last instant a better idea had flashed into his mind. He twisted about and struck {{near the edge of the}} {{starboard}} wing with all his accumulated weight. He was jerked back as he struck. His prow went gliding across its smooth expanse towards the rim. He felt the forward rush of the huge fabric sweeping him and his aeropile along with it, and for a moment that seemed an age he could not tell what was happening. He heard a thousand throats yelling, and perceived that his machine was balanced on the edge of the gigantic float, and driving down, down; glanced over his shoulder and saw the backbone of the aeroplane and the opposite float swaying up. He had a vision through the ribs of sliding chairs, staring faces, and hands clutching at the tilting <b>guide</b> <b>bars.</b> The fenestrations in the further float flashed open as the aeronaut tried to right her. Beyond, he saw a second aeroplane leaping steeply to escape the whirl of its heeling fellow. The broad area of swaying wings seemed to jerk upward. He felt his aeropile had dropped clear, that the monstrous fabric, clean overturned, hung like a sloping wall above him.|$|E

30|$|Although {{our sample}} size was {{increased}} by pooling the variables of {{the right and left}} sides, it was nonetheless small. In addition, even though both retractors are composed of thick (0.9  mm) stainless steel wires, the lever arm and <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> could be deflected during retraction, making accurate force application and location of the force vector difficult. Therefore, a modified APLR is proposed, in which the lever arms of both sides are connected to prevent deflection and a trans-palatal arch is added to link the posterior segments [20]. Furthermore, the difference between the angles of the position of the <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> and tube as well as correlations between tube height and anterior and posterior intrusion should be considered in future studies.|$|R
50|$|A common {{accident}} {{arises from}} kickback, when a chain tooth {{at the tip}} of the <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> catches on wood without cutting through it. This throws the bar (with its moving chain) in an upward arc toward the operator which can cause serious injury or even death.|$|R
5000|$|The {{chainsaw}} [...] "blades" [...] are technically {{known as}} [...] "guide bars". For chainsaw carving these bars have very small noses (typically around 25 mm diameter). This enables {{the artist to}} create detail in the carving that would be impossible with a standard guide bar. The chains that are used on these <b>guide</b> <b>bars</b> are normally modified by reducing {{the length of the}} teeth in order that they are able to cut efficiently {{at the tip of the}} bar. The reason for this modification is that all chains manufactured currently (circa 2007) are made to be used on standard <b>guide</b> <b>bars</b> only. These [...] "carving bars" [...] are manufactured by [...] "Cannon", [...] "GB", and by a companies in Japan supplying [...] "Stihl" [...] and others. The other very important advantage with these <b>guide</b> <b>bars</b> is that they do not [...] "kickback" [...] when using the tip. they are therefore very safe to use in comparison with standard <b>guide</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} fabrication of a long scan stage for metrological atomic force microscope. On designing the system, we mainly consider a simple structure with low vibration and high accuracy. In stead of the traditional two level stages, we used a surface plate as the reference of the main stage. Therefore, it has low profile and simple structure. Surface plate {{was made of the}} ceramic glass with very low thermal expansion. The stage is positioned on the surface plate of 800 mm x 800 mm. It is guided horizontally by a cross structure with two precision bars perpendicularly linked and vertically by the surface plate. The sliding pads of PTFE are used at X- and Y-axes, and also used for vertically supporting the stage. The X-axis <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> with a moving plate is glued on the surface plate. The Y-axis <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> is attached to the X-axis moving plate and moved to the Y-direction. Finally the Y-axis <b>guide</b> <b>bar</b> <b>guides</b> the XY-stage plate, so the XY-stage plate can be moved to two directions. This global stage also has the two-axis flexure structure machined by the precision wire-cutting machine. By combining global stage and micro-stage, the fast and long movement and the fine positioning can be provided. A two-axis tilt stage for adjusting the pitch motions of the stage and a L-shaped mirror for laser interferometer is positioned on the tilt stage...|$|R
