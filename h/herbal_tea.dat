The psilocybin present in certain species of mushrooms can be ingested in several ways: by consuming fresh or dried fruit bodies, by preparing a <b>herbal</b> <b>tea,</b> or by combining with other foods to mask the bitter taste. In rare cases people have injected mushroom extracts intravenously.|$|E
5|$|In South Africa, ants {{are used}} to help harvest rooibos (Aspalathus linearis), which are small seeds {{used to make a}} <b>herbal</b> <b>tea.</b> The plant disperses its seeds widely, making manual {{collection}} difficult. Black ants collect and store these and other seeds in their nest, where humans can gather them en masse. Up to half a pound (200g) of seeds may be collected from one ant-heap.|$|E

40|$|Dehydro pyrrolizidine {{alkaloids}} (dehydro PAs) are carcinogenic phytotoxins {{prevalent in the}} Boraginaceae, Asteraceae and Fabaceae families. Dehydro PAs enter the food and feed chain by co-harvesting of crops intended for human and animal consumption {{as well as by}} carry-over into animal-based products such as milk, eggs and honey. Recently the occurrence of dehydro PAs in <b>teas</b> and <b>herbal</b> <b>teas</b> has gained increasing attention from the EU, due to the high levels of dehydro PAs found in commercially available <b>teas</b> and <b>herbal</b> <b>teas</b> in Germany and Switzerland. Furthermore, several tropane alkaloids (TAs, e. g. scopolamine and hyoscyamine) intoxications due to the consumption of contaminated <b>herbal</b> <b>teas</b> were reported in the literature. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the dehydro PAs and TAs levels in 70 pre-packed teabags of <b>herbal</b> and non-herbal <b>tea</b> types sold in supermarkets in Israel. Chamomile, peppermint and rooibos teas contained high dehydro PAs levels in almost all samples analysed. Lower amounts were detected in black and green teas, while no dehydro PAs were found in fennel and melissa <b>herbal</b> <b>teas.</b> Total dehydro PAs concentrations in chamomile, peppermint and rooibos teas ranged from 20 to 1729 μg/kg. Except for black tea containing only mono-ester retrorsine-type dehydro PAs, all other <b>teas</b> and <b>herbal</b> <b>teas</b> showed mixed patterns of dehydro PA ester types, indicating a contamination by various weed species during harvesting and/or production. The TA levels per teabag were below the recommended acute reference dose; however, the positive findings of TAs in all peppermint tea samples warrant a more extensive survey. The partially high levels of dehydro PAs found in <b>teas</b> and <b>herbal</b> <b>teas</b> present an urgent warning letter to the regulatory authorities to perform routine quality control analysis and implement maximum residual levels for dehydro PAs. </p...|$|R

40|$|Widespread {{consumption}} of <b>herbal</b> <b>teas</b> has stimulated {{interest in their}} role as cancer preventive agents. The present investigation monitored the modulation of methylbenzylnitrosamine (MBN) -induced esophageal squamous cell carcinogenesis by rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) and honeybush (Cyclopia intermedia) herbal and Camellia sinensis teas in male F 344 rats. The tumor multiplicity was significantly (P 10 mm 3). Reduction of the mean total papilloma number correlated with the total polyphenol (TPP) (r = 0. 79; P < 0. 02) and flavanol/proanthocyanidin (FLAVA) (r = 0. 89; P < 0. 008) intake (mg/ 100 g body weight) of the teas and the FLAVA (r = 0. 89; P < 0. 04) and flavonol/flavones/xanthones (r = 0. 99; P < 0. 002) intake when considering only the <b>herbal</b> <b>teas.</b> A daily TPP intake threshold of 7 mg/ 100 g body weight existed below where no inhibition of papilloma development was observed. Fermentation of <b>herbal</b> <b>teas</b> reduced the inhibitory effects on papilloma development associated with {{a reduction in the}} polyphenolic constituents. The inhibitory effect of <b>herbal</b> <b>teas</b> on papilloma development is associated with different flavonoid subgroups and/or combination thereof. Copyright © 2011, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.
