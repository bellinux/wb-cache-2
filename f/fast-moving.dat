5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, it was found that under certain conditions a <b>fast-moving</b> charged particle caused a condensation of supersaturated water vapor along its path. In 1911, Charles Wilson used this principle to devise his cloud chamber so he could photograph the tracks of charged particles, such as <b>fast-moving</b> electrons.|$|E
5|$|Collisions with {{ships are}} {{a major cause of}} mortality. In some areas, they cause a {{substantial}} portion of large whale strandings. Most serious injuries are caused by large, <b>fast-moving</b> ships over or near continental shelves.|$|E
5|$|Feed {{the public}} {{little more than}} rural comedies, <b>fast-moving</b> detective dramas and, later, sexy dolls. No old people; the {{emphasis}} was on youth. No domestic servants, the mass audience wouldn't identify with maids. No serious problems to cope with. Every script had {{to be full of}} action. No physical infirmities.|$|E
5|$|October 26, 1894 – A <b>fast-moving</b> {{hurricane}} to {{the west}} delivers {{a brief period of}} hurricane-force winds, toppling trees and telephone poles. The storm blows down roofing material and ruins vegetable crops.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{mechanical}} experience {{gained from the}} Merchant Navy locomotives, Bulleid incorporated his chain-driven valve gear into what became the new design. This now-infamous component was unique in British locomotive design. It gained notoriety because {{it was difficult to}} access when things went wrong and, in tandem with the <b>fast-moving</b> Bulleid steam reverser, could cause irregular valve movements. The entire system was in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, that provided constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the film was extremely negative. The acting, story, and characters attracted the most criticism {{as well as the}} film's setting on a slow-moving cruise ship, which was much less thrilling than Speed setting on a <b>fast-moving</b> bus. The film was also a financial disappointment, earning $164 million worldwide against a budget of $110 million. It was nominated for eight Golden Raspberry Awards, and won the award for Worst Re-Make or Sequel.|$|E
5|$|One of Kraft's most {{important}} contributions to manned spaceflight {{would be his}} origination {{of the concept of}} a Mission Control Center. Many of the engineers in Project Mercury had previously worked on the flight test of aircraft, where the role for ground support was minimal. However, Kraft soon realized that an astronaut could only do so much, particularly during the <b>fast-moving</b> launch phase; the Mercury spacecraft would require real time monitoring and support from specialist engineers.|$|E
5|$|Surface feeders that swim {{often have}} unique bills as well, adapted for their {{specific}} prey. Prions have special bills with filters called lamellae {{to filter out}} plankton from mouthfuls of water, and many albatrosses and petrels have hooked bills to snatch <b>fast-moving</b> prey. Gulls have more generalised bills that reflect their more opportunistic lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian sparrowhawk's pale underparts {{and darker}} upperparts are {{an example of}} countershading, which helps {{to break up the}} bird's outline. Countershading is {{exhibited}} by birds of prey which hunt birds and other <b>fast-moving</b> animals. The horizontal barring seen on adult Eurasian sparrowhawks is typical of woodland-dwelling predatory birds, while the adult male's bluish colour is also seen in other bird-eating raptors, including the peregrine falcon, the merlin and other Accipiters.|$|E
5|$|The Kola Peninsula {{has many}} small but <b>fast-moving</b> rivers with rapids. The most {{important}} of them are the Ponoy, the Varzuga, the Umba, the Teriberka, the Voronya, and the Yokanga. Most rivers originate from lakes and swamps and collect their waters from melting snow. The rivers become icebound during the winter, although the areas with strong rapids freeze later or not at all.|$|E
5|$|The craters {{are simple}} in structure: bowl-shaped with no flat bottoms and no central peaks. They are {{distributed}} evenly around Ida, {{except for a}} protrusion north of crater Choukoutien which is smoother and less cratered. The ejecta excavated by impacts is deposited differently on Ida than on planets because of its rapid rotation, low gravity and irregular shape. Ejecta blankets settle asymmetrically around their craters, but <b>fast-moving</b> ejecta that escapes from the asteroid is permanently lost.|$|E
5|$|The {{main focus}} of product brand {{management}} lies on the single product or product family. Product design management is linked to research and development, marketing, and brand management, and {{is present in the}} <b>fast-moving</b> consumer goods (FMCG) industry. It is responsible for the visual expressions of the individual product brand, with its diverse customer–brand touch points and the execution of the brand through design.|$|E
5|$|The {{specimen}} NIGP127587 was preserved {{with the}} remains of a lizard in its gut region, indicating that small, <b>fast-moving</b> animals made up part of the diet of Sinosauropteryx prima. Numerous lizards of this type have been found in the same rocks as Sinosauropteryx. These lizards have been interpreted as most likely belonging to the genus Dalinghosaurus. Dalinghosaurus was probably a fast-running lizard adapted to living in open habitats, much like Sinosauropteryx itself.|$|E
5|$|About an {{hour after}} {{fragment}} K entered Jupiter, observers recorded auroral emission near the impact region, {{as well as at}} the antipode of the impact site with respect to Jupiter's strong magnetic field. The cause of these emissions was difficult to establish due to a lack of knowledge of Jupiter's internal magnetic field and of the geometry of the impact sites. One possible explanation was that upwardly accelerating shock waves from the impact accelerated charged particles enough to cause auroral emission, a phenomenon more typically associated with <b>fast-moving</b> solar wind particles striking a planetary atmosphere near a magnetic pole.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to other}} deep-sea sharks, the Izak {{catshark}} {{has a large}} heart suggestive of a relatively active lifestyle. It is a generalist that feeds {{on a wide variety}} of bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods; larger sharks consume proportionately more crustaceans and fewer fishes. At least some part of its recorded diet probably represents scavenging from fishery discards, given the presence of <b>fast-moving,</b> pelagic species that the shark is unlikely to have captured live. Polychaete worms, hydrozoans, gastropods, and hagfish eggs may also be occasionally ingested. This species often has nematode and flatworm parasites in its stomach.|$|E
5|$|Damage in {{the state}} totaled to over $13billion (2004 USD). Charley {{initially}} was expected to hit further north in Tampa, and caught many Floridians off-guard due to a sudden change in the storm's track as it approached the state. Throughout the United States, Charley caused 10deaths and $15.4billion in damage to insured residential property, making it the second costliest hurricane in United States history at the time (it has since dropped to ninth). Charley was a compact, <b>fast-moving</b> storm, which limited the scope and severity of the damage.|$|E
5|$|Flash floods {{occurred}} in mountainous regions of southeastern New York, including Port Jervis along the Delaware River. Wappinger Creek flooded to cause heavy damage. Most streams in the Rondout Creek basin left damage due to <b>fast-moving</b> waters, including heavy damage near Ellenville. Damage in New York was largely limited {{to an area}} between Port Jervis and Poughkeepsie. Several bridges were destroyed along the Bash Bish Brook, and portions of U.S. Route 209 were flooded. Damage totaled $16.2million, {{and there was one}} death in the state.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Kathleen was a {{tropical}} cyclone that caused destructive impacts in California. On September 7, 1976, {{a tropical}} depression formed; {{two days later}} it accelerated north towards the Baja California Peninsula. Kathleen brushed the Pacific coast of the peninsula as a hurricane on September 9 and made landfall as a <b>fast-moving</b> tropical storm the next day. With its circulation intact and still a tropical storm, Kathleen headed north into the United States and affected California and Arizona. Kathleen finally dissipated late on September 11.|$|E
5|$|India is tenth in {{the world}} in factory output. Manufacturing sector in {{addition}} to mining, quarrying, electricity and gas together account for 27.6% of the GDP and employ 17% of the total workforce. Economic reforms introduced after 1991 brought foreign competition, led to privatisation of certain public sector industries, opened up sectors hitherto reserved for the public sector and led to an expansion in the production of <b>fast-moving</b> consumer goods. In recent years, Indian cities have continued to liberalise, but excessive and burdensome business regulations remain a problem in some cities, like Kochi and Kolkata.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} intended to use a gear-driven valve gear, but space restrictions within the frames and wartime material shortages led Bulleid to design his novel chain-driven valve gear. This component was unique amongst British locomotive design practices. It later gained a bad reputation, because it could cause highly irregular valve events, a problem compounded by the <b>fast-moving</b> Bulleid steam reverser. The entire system was located in a sealed oil bath, another unique design, providing constant lubrication to the moving parts.|$|E
5|$|Operation Weserübung {{began on}} 9 April 1940 with the invasions of Norway and Denmark, Denmark capitulated within the day whilst Norway {{continued}} to resist with British and French help. The campaign {{was not a}} Blitzkrieg of <b>fast-moving</b> armoured divisions supported by air power as the mountainous terrain ruled out close Panzer/Stuka cooperation. Instead, the Germans relied on paratroops, airborne troops transported by Junkers Ju 52s and specialised ski troops. The Ju 87s were given the role of ground attack and anti-shipping missions. The Ju 87 {{proved to be the}} most effective weapon in the Luftwaffe's armoury carrying out the latter task.|$|E
5|$|The fort's {{armament}} was revised {{several times}} during its seventy years of military usage, as its role evolved in the river's defensive system. It was initially a front-line fortification, supported by Shornemead Fort and Cliffe Fort located {{to the south and}} east respectively on the Kent shore. Over time, as batteries and forts further downriver became the front line of the Thames defences, Coalhouse Fort was stripped of its main weapons and its fabric was altered to support smaller quick-firing guns intended to be used against <b>fast-moving</b> surface and aerial targets. Its last military usage was as a training facility for a few years after the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|The spill cleanup {{occurred}} during the nesting season for snowy plovers so special precautions were necessary while cleaning up tar balls. The birds are often found on the beaches {{along the coast of}} the Oxnard plain. Their nests are hard to see in the open sand and the birds are easily frightened away by human activity leaving the eggs to <b>fast-moving</b> predators such as sea gulls. Least terns were another endangered species of bird that was a concern during the cleanup efforts.|$|E
5|$|Tomb Raider is {{presented}} in third-person perspective. Players {{take control of the}} series lead character Lara Croft. The game uses an interconnected hub-and-spoke model that combines action-adventure, exploration, and survival mechanics. Players can traverse between the camps and across the island using footpaths, improvised or already-available ziplines and climbable tracks. Many of the players moves are carried over from the previous games created by Crystal Dynamics, with some tweaks added, such as incorporating elements of stealth gameplay. Quick Time Events are scattered at regular intervals throughout the game, often appearing at crucial or <b>fast-moving</b> points in the game's plot, such as extracting a shard of metal, and escaping a collapsing cave.|$|E
5|$|Adult and {{juvenile}} finetooth sharks form large schools. This energetic, <b>fast-moving</b> predator feeds mainly on small bony fishes, often entering the surf zone {{during the day}} to hunt. The most important prey of this species in the northwestern Atlantic is the Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus), with sharks of all ages off northwestern Florida eat almost nothing else. The menhaden are swallowed whole after the head has been removed. Other known prey species include spot croaker (Leiostomus xanthurus), Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus), mullet (Mugil spp.), shrimp, and in one case a juvenile Atlantic sharpnose shark (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae), {{which may have been}} scavenged from the bycatch discard of a shrimp trawler. The finetooth shark may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Parasites documented from this species include the tapeworm Triloculatum geeceearelensis, and unidentified species in the genera Anthobothrium, Paraorygmatobothrium, and Phoreiobothrium.|$|E
5|$|After {{assuming}} his new position, Treloar {{was sent}} to AIF Headquarters in the Middle East where Australian forces were engaged in the North African Campaign. While {{en route to the}} Middle East he visited Malaya. Conditions in North Africa proved more challenging than those in World War I, however, as the combat was <b>fast-moving</b> and the Australian troops felt less motivation to collect artefacts than those of the First AIF. Treloar was supported by a small staff, but fell out with his second in command who questioned both how he administered the unit and his personal efficiency. He also lacked a patron in the AIF and was handicapped by his relatively junior rank. Due to his absence from the Memorial, Treloar had only limited input into the design of its galleries and he was unable to attend its official opening in November 1941.|$|E
5|$|After metamorphosis, {{young adults}} may {{disperse}} into terrestrial habitats or {{continue to live}} in water. Almost all frog species are carnivorous as adults, preying on invertebrates, including arthropods, worms, snails, and slugs. A few of the larger ones may eat other frogs, small mammals, and fish. Some frogs use their sticky tongues to catch <b>fast-moving</b> prey, while others push food into their mouths with their hands. A few species also eat plant matter; the tree frog Xenohyla truncata is partly herbivorous, its diet including a large proportion of fruit, Leptodactylus mystaceus has been found to eat plants, and folivory occurs in Euphlyctis hexadactylus, with plants constituting 79.5% of its diet by volume. Adult frogs are themselves attacked by many predators. The northern leopard frog (Rana pipiens) is eaten by herons, hawks, fish, large salamanders, snakes, raccoons, skunks, mink, bullfrogs, and other animals.|$|E
5|$|Animals bolstered morale at the front, {{due to the}} soldiers' {{affection for}} them. Some {{recruitment}} posters from World War I showcased the partnership between horse and man in attempts to gain more recruits. Despite the boost in morale, horses {{could also be a}} health hazard for the soldiers, mainly because of the difficulty of maintaining high levels of hygiene around horses, which was especially noted in camps in Egypt. Horse manure was commonplace in the battle and staging areas on several fronts, creating breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects. Manure was supposed to be buried, but <b>fast-moving</b> battle conditions often made this impossible. Sanitation officers were responsible for the burial of horse carcasses, among other duties.|$|E
5|$|Candide is characterised by its sarcastic tone {{as well as}} by its erratic, fantastical and <b>fast-moving</b> plot. A picaresque novel with a story {{similar to}} that of a more serious coming-of-age {{narrative}} (Bildungsroman), it parodies many adventure and romance clichés, the struggles of which are caricatured in a tone that is mordantly matter-of-fact. Still, the events discussed are often based on historical happenings, such as the Seven Years' War and the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. As philosophers of Voltaire's day contended with the problem of evil, so too does Candide in this short novel, albeit more directly and humorously. Voltaire ridicules religion, theologians, governments, armies, philosophies, and philosophers through allegory; most conspicuously, he assaults Leibniz and his optimism.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) {{established}} ten {{camps in}} Moshannon State Forest, and ten in Elk State Forest. The {{young men of}} the CCC planted trees, blazed new trails, built roads and bridges, and fought fires, which {{continued to be a}} problem. In 1938 a <b>fast-moving</b> fire in the Elk State Forest, north of Quehanna, killed eight firefighters. The CCC also built structures and established or improved many of the state parks, including Parker Dam and S. B. Elliott State Parks on the western Quehanna plateau. The United States' entry into World War II ended the CCC, and all its camps were closed by the summer of 1942. The Quehanna Trail System passes near or through the sites of several former CCC camps.|$|E
5|$|Fresh {{worries about}} France, {{combined}} {{with the development of}} rifled cannon and iron-clad warships, led to the Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom being established in 1859, and expressing fears about the security of the south coast. In response, Sandgate was re-equipped with heavier guns in 1859, and extensive work was carried out on Southsea. Hurst was fitted with two huge batteries of heavy rifled breech-loading guns, protected by iron armour-plate, intended for use against <b>fast-moving</b> enemy warships. Tilbury Blockhouse was destroyed to make way for heavier guns at the fort after 1868. Portland was readopted by army as a garrison base in 1869 in response to fears of an invasion, but it was not rearmed.|$|E
5|$|How the ostensibly weak-swimming {{frilled shark}} captures active, <b>fast-moving</b> squid {{is a matter}} of speculation. One {{possibility}} is that it takes advantage of injured squid, or those that are exhausted and dying after spawning. Alternatively, it may surprise its prey by curving its body and, bracing itself with its posteriorly positioned fins, launching a quick strike forward {{in the manner of a}} snake. It may also be able to close its gill slits and create negative pressure to suck prey into its mouth. The many small, sharp, recurved teeth of the frilled shark are functionally similar to squid jigs and could easily snag the body or tentacles of a squid, particularly as they are rotated outwards when the jaws are protruded. Observations of captive frilled sharks swimming with their mouths open suggest that the small teeth, light against the dark mouth, may even fool squid into attacking and entangling themselves.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Vince's {{impressive}} {{organization was}} very short lived as westerly wind shear began to erode the eye within hours. In response, the storm weakened to {{a tropical storm}} shortly thereafter. A broad low-level trough approached the storm from the northwest, pulling the convection northward as the storm's low-level center accelerated eastward. On 10 October, two brief bursts of convection surprised forecasters, but with the sea surface temperature as low as 22°C (72°F), the flares were not sustained. Vince continued to weaken as it approached the Iberian Peninsula and became a tropical depression on 11 October, shortly before it made landfall near Huelva, Spain. The <b>fast-moving</b> tropical depression quickly dissipated over land. Its remnants moved across southern Spain, dumping rain on the drought-ridden region, and moved into the Mediterranean Sea south of Alicante {{in the early hours}} of 12 October.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the victory at Tobruk, Rommel persuaded Hitler to {{authorise}} an attack on Egypt instead of Malta, over Kesselring's objections. The parachute troops assembled for Operation Herkules were sent to Rommel. Things went well at first, with Rommel winning the Battle of Mersa Matruh, but just as Kesselring had warned, the logistical difficulties mounted and the result was the disastrous First Battle of El Alamein, Battle of Alam el Halfa and Second Battle of El Alamein. Kesselring considered Rommel to be a great general leading <b>fast-moving</b> troops at the corps level of command, but felt that he was too moody and changeable for higher command. For Kesselring, Rommel's nervous breakdown and hospitalisation for depression {{at the end of the}} African Campaign only confirmed this.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of its development, the Sharingan will grant the user three unique abilities: The first being its famous ability for the user to {{instantly}} memorize and replicate any opponent's movement and attacks with perfect accuracy. The Sharingan's second ability grants the user increased ocular perception, allowing them to read and predict the movements and actions of <b>fast-moving</b> objects. This also allows the user to easily recognize genjutsu and different forms of chakra (i.e.: to visualize chakra in different colors). Its final ability is a brand of scenarios that suggests actions and thoughts to the opponent, acting as {{an effective way to}} produce beyond genjutsu abilities or implant memories in another person.|$|E
5|$|Pilot whales {{generally}} {{take several}} breaths before diving {{for a few}} minutes. Feeding dives may last over ten minutes. They are capable of diving to depths of 600 meters, but most dives are {{to a depth of}} 30–60 m. Shallow dives tend to take place during the day, while deeper ones take place at night. When making deep dives, pilot whales often make fast sprints to catch <b>fast-moving</b> prey such as squid. Compared to sperm whales and beaked whales, foraging short-finned pilot whales are more energetic at the same depth. When they reach the end of their dives, pilot whales will sprint, possibly to catch prey, and then make a few buzzes. This is unusual considering deep-diving, breath-holding animals would be expected to swim slowly to conserve oxygen. The animal's high metabolism possibly allows it to sprint at deep depths, which would also give it shorter diving periods than some other marine mammals. This may also be the case for long-finned pilot whales.|$|E
