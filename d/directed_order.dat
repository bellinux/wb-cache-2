40|$|Partially ordered groups, {{also known}} as po-groups, are groups with a {{compatible}} partial order. Results from M. I. Zajceva and H. -H. Teh are combined {{in order to provide}} a full characterisation of linear order extensions of a given order on a group. In contrast to Teh this approach provides a method to discuss linear orders of different abelian rank in a uniform manner. This will be achieved by modelling the linear orders using hyperplanes in a real vector spaces. Among some additional remarks a construction of an archimedian <b>directed</b> <b>order</b> is given for every torsion free abelian group. Comment: Talk at AAA 81 conference in Salzburg.
