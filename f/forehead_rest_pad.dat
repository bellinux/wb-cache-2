60|$|Pippin had finished. His <b>forehead</b> <b>rested</b> on the table, {{his arms}} hung at his sides; he was stone-dead! His face wore a smile, {{and by his}} side lay an empty {{laudanum}} bottle.|$|R
60|$|The {{memory was}} {{intolerable}} now. She rose--restless and feverish--and {{stood by the}} fire, {{one hand on the}} high mantel-shelf, her <b>forehead</b> <b>resting</b> against that hand, one foot on the fender, and her aching eyes gazing into the red hot glow.|$|R
6000|$|Violet {{sat with}} her <b>forehead</b> <b>resting</b> on her hand, {{and there was a}} short space of {{thoughtful}} silence. It resulted in Theodora's saying, in a sad, low, humble tone, her eyes looking straight into the red fire, 'Do you ever hear of Mr. Fotheringham?' ...|$|R
60|$|Again she slept. And {{again she}} was aroused, this time {{not by the}} storm, but by Billy. She could not see, but by feeling she ascertained his strange position. He was outside the {{blankets}} and on his knees, his <b>forehead</b> <b>resting</b> on the boards, his shoulders writhing with suppressed anguish.|$|R
60|$|In the evening, {{our family}} party was {{assembled}} in the hall, to enjoy the refreshing breeze. Sophy was playing some favorite Scotch airs on the piano, while Glencoe, seated apart, with his <b>forehead</b> <b>resting</b> on his hand, was buried {{in one of those}} pensive reveries that made him so interesting to me.|$|R
30|$|Throughout all {{of these}} tasks, gaze {{location}} from the participants’ right eye was tracked using an infrared eye tracker (EyeLink 1000; SR Research Ltd, Mississauga, ON, Canada) that sampled at 1000 [*]Hz. The eye tracker camera was mounted on the SR Research Desktop Mount. Participants were instructed to keep their heads in an SR Research chin/forehead reset throughout all of the tasks to minimize head movement during the tasks. The camera was positioned 52 [*]cm {{from the top of}} the <b>forehead</b> <b>rest.</b> The movies were presented on a 19 in (74 [*]cm) monitor (1400 [*]×[*] 900 resolution, viewing distance of 58 [*]cm from the <b>forehead</b> <b>rest,</b> viewing angle of 38.6 °). Data were exported from Data Viewer software (SR Research Ltd, Mississauga, ON, Canada) into text files, which were then imported into R (R Core Team, 2014) for analysis.|$|R
50|$|The {{patient is}} {{positioned}} appropriately and comfortably against the <b>forehead</b> <b>rest</b> and chin rest. Minor {{adjustments to the}} head position are made to centre the pupil on the display screen to allow eye monitoring throughout the test. The lens holder should be {{as close to the}} patient's eye as possible to avoid artefacts (see Disadvantages for possible artefacts).|$|R
30|$|Both clips were {{presented}} at a frame rate of 30 {{frames per second}} (fps) and a resolution of 1080 [*]×[*] 720  pixels. The video clips were shown on a 17 ” ViewSonic Graphics Series CRT monitor (Model G 90 fb). A chin and <b>forehead</b> <b>rest</b> set a fixed viewing distance of 60.96  cm. The screen subtended 21.42 °[*]×[*] 16.10 ° of visual angle.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of Ramona {{kneeling}} in sorrow {{at the grave}} of Alesandro in the cemetery on the Coahuilla Indian Reservation, ca. 1905. Her <b>forehead</b> <b>rests</b> in her hands as she grieves. A wooden cross marks the grave. Other wooden cross grave markers are visible throughout the cemetery. Some of the grave sites are enclosed in small rectangular picket fences. Ramona was made famous in the novel {{of the same name}} by Helen Hunt Jackson...|$|R
6000|$|Then, {{the kiss}} {{he had seen}} her give the pillow afflicted him with sudden headiness, and he went up to her. Touching her eyes with his lips, he thought with queer excitement: 'I've done it! Yesterday all was sudden--anyhow; but now--I've done it!' The girl let her <b>forehead</b> <b>rest</b> against his lips, which moved {{downwards}} till they reached hers. That first real lover's kiss-strange, wonderful, still almost innocent--in which heart did it make the most disturbance? ...|$|R
6000|$|After pacing up {{and down}} Rose's room till he was tired, Walter sat down to rest, for Rose had {{especially}} forbidden him to lie down, lest he should derange his hair. He grew very sleepy, and at last, with his arms crossed on the table, and his <b>forehead</b> <b>resting</b> on them, fell sound asleep, and did not awaken till it was broad daylight, and calls of [...] "Rose! Rose!" [...] were heard outside the locked door.|$|R
60|$|The Bassa {{rose from}} his divan and drew aside the hangings leading to a large hall, closely {{followed}} by Neangir and Sumi. There they saw two young men, one about seventeen, and the other nineteen years of age. The younger was seated before a table, his <b>forehead</b> <b>resting</b> on his right hand, which he was watering with his tears. He raised his head for a moment when his father entered, and Neangir and Sumi both saw that this hand was of ebony.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile George Foster went to {{the chamber}} of the Moor. He found his master seated, as was his wont, with the hookah before him, but with the {{mouthpiece}} lying idly on his knee, and his <b>forehead</b> <b>resting</b> on one hand. So deeply was he absorbed in communing with his own thoughts, {{that he did not}} observe the entrance of his slave until he had been twice addressed. Then, looking up {{as if he had been}} slightly startled, he bade him sit down.|$|R
40|$|Current {{attitudes to}} the medical {{management}} of traumatic hyphaema were investigated {{by means of a}} postal survey. A single page questionnaire was sent to all consultant ophthalmologists in the UK who were members of the college of ophthalmologists. The response rate was 50 %. Opinion was sharply divided on the use of bed <b>rest,</b> <b>padding</b> and topical therapy. However, there was almost universal agreement that systemic therapy, either steroids or antifibrinolytics, were not indicated...|$|R
60|$|Again John waited leisurely {{until the}} {{observation}} had thoroughly penetrated to his brain, and then replying, 'No offence as YET,' applied a light to his pipe and smoked in placid silence; {{now and then}} casting a sidelong look at a man wrapped in a loose riding-coat with huge cuffs ornamented with tarnished silver lace and large metal buttons, who sat apart from the regular frequenters of the house, and wearing a hat flapped over his face, which was still further shaded by the hand on which his <b>forehead</b> <b>rested,</b> looked unsociable enough.|$|R
30|$|The Cp/Cpk values after {{performing}} the few iterations {{of data collection}} weregreater than 1.33, and hence the process was declared as a capable process. After{{performing the}} root cause analysis, the major root cause, confirmed by the one-wayANOVA technique, was the improper setting of the tool wear compensation knobfollowed by the replacement of worn-out fixture <b>rest</b> <b>pads</b> for the thrust facegrinding KPC. Hence, the one-way ANOVA technique was employed successfully foridentification of the root cause liable for the low process capability.|$|R
60|$|Poor little Flo, who {{had been}} deeply {{affected}} by the terrible appearance of her favourite Ivor, and who {{had never seen him}} in such a plight before, quietly slipped out of old Molly's hut and went straight to that of the keeper. She found him seated on a chair with his elbows on his knees, his <b>forehead</b> <b>resting</b> on his hands, and his strong fingers grasping his hair as if about to tear it out by the roots. Flo, who was naturally fearless and trustful, ran straight to him and placed a hand on his shoulder. He started and looked round.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Lyddell {{had been}} gone about two days; Caroline and Clara were at High Down, and Marian was {{returning}} from a solitary ramble in the park, enjoying her last letter from Agnes, when, as she crossed the lawn, she was startled by finding Lionel stretched on his face on the grass, just at the turn where some bushes concealed him from the windows. He lay flat, without his hat, his <b>forehead</b> <b>resting</b> on one arm; while with his hand he tore up daisies and grass, and threw them hastily over his shoulder, while his whole frame quivered in a convulsive agony of distress.|$|R
6000|$|With my head bent, and my <b>forehead</b> <b>resting</b> on my hands, I sat amidst grouped tree-stems and {{branching}} brushwood. Whatever talk passed amongst my neighbours, I might hear, if I would; I {{was near}} enough; {{but for some}} time, there was scarce motive to attend. They gossiped about the dresses, the music, the illuminations, the fine night. I listened to hear them say, [...] "It is calm weather for his voyage; the Antigua" [...] (his ship) [...] "will sail prosperously." [...] No such remark fell; neither the Antigua, nor her course, nor her passenger were named.|$|R
60|$|She {{shook her}} head. She {{raised her hand}} timidly to the lapel of my coat, and {{suddenly}} I felt her palm, cool and firm, upon my <b>forehead.</b> It <b>rested</b> there but an instant.|$|R
30|$|In this iteration, data is {{collected}} after machine preventive maintenanceschedule completion and replacement of grinding shoes {{of the machine}} as wellas <b>rest</b> <b>pads</b> of the fixture. From the set of data in Table  4, it is seen {{that there is a}} noticeable increase ofCp from 0.120 to 1.23 and Cpk from 0.21 to 0.99. This increase is a positive sign, butstill, the process is not capable as both Cp and Cpk are far less than the desired value of 1.33. This calls foranother iteration, i.e., iteration 4.|$|R
60|$|Everybody started. Ursula {{watched the}} boy. He was evidently poor, and rather cunning. A stiff bit of hair stood {{straight}} off his <b>forehead,</b> the <b>rest</b> fitted {{close to his}} meagre head. He was pale and colourless.|$|R
6000|$|Renouard {{went away}} to some {{distance}} from the house and threw himself down {{in the shade of a}} tree. He lay there perfectly still with his <b>forehead</b> <b>resting</b> on his folded arms, light-headed and thinking. It seemed to him that he must be on fire, then that he had fallen into a cool whirlpool, a smooth funnel of water swirling about with nauseating rapidity. And then (it must have been a reminiscence of his boyhood) he was walking on the dangerous thin ice of a river, unable to turn back. [...] . Suddenly it parted from shore to shore with a loud crack like the report of a gun.|$|R
60|$|The first {{intelligence}} that arrived was brought by Uncle Roger and Beatrice, who, rather to their surprise, {{came back in}} the gig, and greatly relieved their minds with the intelligence of Frederick's life, and of Philip Carey's arrival. Henrietta had sprung eagerly up on their first entrance, with parted lips and earnest eyes, and listened to their narration with trembling throbbing hope, but with scarcely a word; and when she heard that Fred still lay senseless and motionless, she again turned away, and hid her face {{on the arm of}} the sofa, without one look at Beatrice, reckless of the pang that shot through the heart of one flesh from that trying watch over her brother. Beatrice hoped for one word, one kiss, and looked wistfully at the long veil of half uncurled ringlets that floated over the crossed arms on which her <b>forehead</b> <b>rested,</b> and meantime submitted with a kind of patient indifference to her grandmother's caress, drank hot wine and water, sat by the fire, and finally was sent upstairs to change her dress. Too restless, too anxious, too wretched to stay there alone, longing for some interchange of sympathy,--but her mind too turbid with agitation to seek it where it would most surely have been found,--she hastened down again. Grandmamma was busied in giving directions for the room which was being prepared for Fred; Uncle Roger had walked out to meet those who were conveying him home: and Henrietta was sitting in the window, her <b>forehead</b> <b>resting</b> against the glass, watching intently for their arrival.|$|R
60|$|The Hottentot obeyed, {{and seated}} upon the heap of skins, her <b>forehead</b> <b>resting</b> {{on her hand}} and her fingers buried in her silky rain-soaked hair, Jess began to review the position. It was evident to her that Frank Muller would {{be as good as}} his word. She knew him too well to doubt this for a moment. If Bessie did not marry him he would murder the old man, as he had tried to murder herself and John, only this time judicially, and then abduct her sister afterwards. She was the only price that he was {{prepared}} to take in exchange for her uncle's life. But it was impossible to allow Bessie to be so sacrificed; the thought was horrible to her.|$|R
60|$|Words that to {{some might}} seem wild, even insane in their extravagance, sung by some ancient {{forgotten}} poet; or possibly the motto of some love-sick knight-errant, whose passion was consumed to ashes long centuries ago. But not wild nor insane to me, dwelling alone on a vast stony plain in everlasting twilight, {{where there was no}} motion, nor any sound; but all things, even trees, ferns, and grasses, were stone. And in that place I had sat for many a thousand years, drawn up and motionless, with stony fingers clasped round my legs, and <b>forehead</b> <b>resting</b> on my knees; and there would I sit, unmoving, immovable, for many a thousand years to come--I, no longer I, in a universe where she was not, and God was not.|$|R
5000|$|Use alcohol wipes to {{wipe down}} all {{surfaces}} {{that have been}} exposed to prior patients, predominately the <b>forehead</b> and chin <b>rest</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The {{collared}} whitestart is 12.5 cm {{in length}} and weighs 11 g. It has a chestnut crown bordered with black, and a black <b>forehead.</b> The <b>rest</b> of the upperparts are slaty black, and the tail is black with white edges. The face and underparts are bright yellow, with a black band across the breast.|$|R
50|$|The male long-tailed silky-flycatcher is 24 cm {{long and}} has a pale grey <b>forehead.</b> The <b>rest</b> of the crested head, neck, throat and lower belly are yellow. The back, lower breast and upper belly are blue-grey, and the flight {{feathers}} and long pointed tail are black. The outer tail feathers are spotted with white.|$|R
60|$|The restlessness {{that had}} driven {{her up and}} down the stairs, and {{backward}} and forward in the hall, left her as suddenly as it had come. She waited through the second interval, leaning on the window-sill, and staring, without conscious thought of any kind, into the black night. The howling of a belated dog was borne toward her on the wind, at intervals, from some distant part of the suburb. She found herself following the faint sound as it died away into silence with a dull attention, and listening for its coming again with an expectation that was duller still. Her arms lay like lead on the window-sill; her <b>forehead</b> <b>rested</b> against the glass without feeling the cold. It was not till the moon struggled out again that she was startled into sudden self-remembrance. She turned quickly, and looked at the clock; seven minutes had passed since the second Pouring.|$|R
60|$|A little wearily {{she pushed}} back {{the masses of}} hair from her <b>forehead.</b> Her head <b>rested</b> for a moment upon her fingers. Her eyes {{deliberately}} sought mine.|$|R
60|$|When {{we came to}} the court, {{there was}} the Lord Chancellor--the same whom I had seen in his private room in Lincoln's Inn--sitting in great state and gravity on the bench, with the mace and seals on a red table below him and an immense flat nosegay, like a little garden, which scented the whole court. Below the table, again, was a long row of solicitors, with bundles of papers on the matting at their feet; {{and then there were the}} gentlemen of the bar in wigs and gowns--some awake and some asleep, and one talking, and nobody paying much {{attention}} to what he said. The Lord Chancellor leaned back in his very easy chair with his elbow on the cushioned arm and his <b>forehead</b> <b>resting</b> on his hand; some of those who were present dozed; some read the newspapers; some walked about or whispered in groups: all seemed perfectly at their ease, by no means in a hurry, very unconcerned, and extremely comfortable.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know, but my lamp went out, {{and then}} a light began to shine behind me. I turned, and {{on the steps of}} that {{crucifix}} I saw a woman kneeling. Her arms clasped the feet of the figure, her <b>forehead</b> <b>rested</b> upon the feet, her long black hair flowed down, she was dressed in white, and the light came from her body and her head. Very slowly she turned and looked at me, and oh, Heaven! that face----" [...] and he put his hand before his eyes and groaned. [...] "It was beautiful; yes, yes, but fearful to see, like an avenging angel. I fled, and the light--only the light--came with me down the cave, even at the mouth of it there was a little. I have seen a spirit, I who did not believe in spirits, I have seen a spirit, and I tell you that not for all the gold in the world will I enter that place again." ...|$|R
5000|$|Scythrop ... {{threw himself}} into his arm-chair, crossed his left foot over his right knee, placed the hollow {{of his left hand}} on the {{interior}} ancle of his left leg, rested his right elbow on the elbow of the chair, placed the ball of his right thumb against his right temple, curved the forefinger along the upper part of his <b>forehead,</b> <b>rested</b> the point of the middle finger on the bridge of his nose, and the points of the two others on {{the lower part of the}} palm, fixed his eyes intently on the veins in the back of his left hand, and sat in this position like the immoveable Theseus, who, as is well known to many who have not been at college, and to some few who have, sedet, æternumque sedebit. We hope the admirers of the minutiæ in poetry and romance will appreciate this accurate description of a pensive attitude.|$|R
6000|$|... "One {{thing that}} Polly does Sunday nights, {{is to take}} Will's head in her lap, and smooth his <b>forehead.</b> It <b>rests</b> him after {{studying}} so hard, she says. If you don't like the pillow, I could do that for you, 'cause you look {{as if you were}} more tired of studying than Will," [...] said Maud, with some hesitation, but an evident desire to be useful and agreeable.|$|R
60|$|Love! The {{greatest}} of these. The {{greatest of}} all things. Better than fame. Better than knowledge. So came the great discovery like a flood across his mind, pouring over it with the cadence of the hymn and sending a tide of pink in sympathy across his <b>forehead.</b> The <b>rest</b> of the service was phantasmagorial background to that great reality--a phantasmagorial background a little inclined to stare. He, Mr. Lewisham, was in Love.|$|R
