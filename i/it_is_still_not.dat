5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> certain {{how many}} people died on the inner German border or who they all were, as the GDR treated such {{information}} as a closely guarded secret. But estimates have risen steadily since unification, as evidence has been gathered from East German records. As of 2009, unofficial estimates are up to 1,100people, though officially released figures give a count from 270 up to 421 deaths.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{original}} Tekken Tag Tournament, the game's sequel features a storyline although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> the series canon. However, certain characters' endings are canon, which are {{followed in the}} sequel game Tekken 7. In the story, Heihachi Mishima has developed a rejuvenation serum, which {{has the ability to}} regress his appearance and power. After consuming it, Heihachi hosts another King of Iron Fist Tournament, sensing powerful challengers who would come to the tournament.|$|E
5|$|In the Hindu religion, {{there has}} been partial success in terms of gender {{equality}} reform laws and family law. While {{this is a major}} advancement relative to other religions in India, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> a complete triumph in terms of feminism and relieving oppression. Gandhi came up with the term stree shakti (women power) for the concept of womanhood. In the Hindu religion, Gods are not exclusively male. Hinduism sheds a positive light on femininity; females are considered to complement and complete their male counterparts. It {{is important to note that}} both the deity of knowledge and the deity of wealth are female.|$|E

5|$|Malmö Stadion was {{originally}} {{built for the}} 1958 FIFA World Cup, during which it was the venue for four matches. It replaced Malmö IP as Malmö's main sports stadium, where IFK Malmö, MAI and Malmö FF had been based since the early 20th century. It also hosted three matches during the 1992 UEFA European Football Championship. The stadium today holds 26,500 spectators when in its sporting configuration, with 14,000 fans seated and 12,500 standing. For concerts, the ground can hold up to 40,000 people depending on {{the location of the}} stage. On 2 February 2015 Malmö Stad took the decision to approve the demolition of the stadium for redevelopment of the area. Malmö Stad has previously decided that a new public swimming arena is to be built on the site in the near future. As of February 2015 <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> known when the demolition process will begin.|$|E

25|$|When {{the step}} of {{creating}} aggregate tables is skipped, the query performance then suffers because the larger detailed tables must be queried. This can be partially remedied by adding additional aggregate tables, however <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> practical to create aggregate tables for all combinations of dimensions/attributes.|$|E
25|$|However, {{even after}} the above deliberations, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> clear whether one is {{justified}} in using an inherently linear relation to simplify a nonlinear wave equation. Nevertheless, {{it is a very}} common practice in nonlinear acoustics as the textbooks on the subject show: e.g., Naugolnykh and Ostrovsky and Hamilton and Morfey.|$|E

25|$|The 2007 Georgia plane downing {{incident}} {{refers to}} the possible downing, by Georgia's anti-aircraft system, of a military plane that violated Georgia's air space on August 21, 2007.

25|$|In the Republic of Ireland townlands {{continue}} to be used on addresses. In 2005 the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources announced that a postcode system was to be introduced (see Republic of Ireland postal addresses).

25|$|It {{also seems}} {{that people who}} are more {{creative}} {{are also more likely to}} show a similar pattern of brain activation. Some researchers have been quick to point out that this in no way suggests that paranormal, mystical or creative experiences are in any way by themselves a symptom of mental illness, as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> clear what makes some such experiences beneficial and others distressing.|$|E
50|$|Sofia City Court {{declined}} on 21 October 2014 {{to extradite}} Koblyakov. The Court had rejected Russia's request to extradite Nikolay Koblyakov because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> clear {{why he was}} wanted and, according to the prosecutor, civil liberties of the activist being sought by Moscow might be persecuted there.|$|R
25|$|In the 1922 Tour de France, Hector Heusghem {{had lost}} the race because he {{received}} a one-hour penalty for illegally changing his bicycle.

25|$|From {{the mid-19th}} century, atlases {{published}} in the United States more commonly treated North and South America as separate continents, while atlases published in Europe usually considered them one continent.

25|$|While the Montepulciano d'Abruzzo grape has {{no known}} {{relationship}} to the Tuscan wine village of Montepulciano or the Sangiovese grape behind the wines of Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, it was thought of {{for a time in}} the 19th century that the Montepulciano grape and Sangiovese maybe related. While this relationship has proven false, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> known how the dominant grape of Abruzzo took the name of the Renaissance era town.|$|E
25|$|Because the core-collapse {{supernova}} mechanism {{itself is}} imperfectly understood, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> known {{whether it is}} possible for a star to collapse directly to a black hole without producing a visible supernova, or whether some supernovae initially form unstable neutron stars which then collapse into black holes; the exact relation between the initial mass of the star and the final remnant is also not completely certain. Resolution of these uncertainties requires the analysis of more supernovae and supernova remnants.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> {{clear whether}} {{magnetic}} resonance venography, venous angiography, or Doppler sonography {{should be considered}} {{the gold standard for}} the diagnosis of CCSVI. Use of magnetic resonance venography for the diagnosis of CCSVI in MS patients has been proposed by some to have limited value, and should be used only in combination with other techniques. Others have stated that magnetic resonance venography is a valid measure which has advantages over Doppler including the fact that results are more operator-independent.|$|E

5000|$|In the 15th century, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> a {{fully-fledged}} town, but archeological {{evidence shows}} that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a pre-urban settlement.

[...] Additionally, a large community of Armenian traders settled in the 14th or 15th centuries.|$|R
25|$|The {{existence}} of an almost complex structure is a topological question and {{is relatively easy to}} answer, as discussed above. The {{existence of}} an integrable almost complex structure, on the other hand, is a much more difficult analytic question. For example, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> known whether S6 admits an integrable almost complex structure, despite a long history of ultimately unverified claims. Smoothness issues are important. For real-analytic J, the Newlander–Nirenberg theorem follows from the Frobenius theorem; for C∞ (and less smooth) J, analysis is required (with more difficult techniques as the regularity hypothesis weakens).|$|E
25|$|On October 5, 1970, {{members of}} the FLQ's Liberation Cell kidnapped James Richard Cross, the British Trade Commissioner, {{as he was leaving}} his home for work. Shortly afterwards, on October 10, the Chénier Cell kidnapped the Minister of Labour and Vice-Premier of Quebec, Pierre Laporte. Laporte was coming from a meeting with others where they had {{discussed}} the demands of the FLQ. After the demands were denied, Pierre Laporte was immediately killed by the FLQ (although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> known how the FLQ knew of the decision so quickly).|$|E
25|$|The art {{began to}} be taught in the West somewhere along the 1960s-1970s. However, it only rose to {{prominence}} among martial arts communities worldwide during {{the first decade of}} the 21st century. Currently, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>not</b> well known among the general public. One explanation for this situation is that unlike other traditional oriental martial arts, Xing Yi was not a notable style in movies which became popular in the West (and though a modified 'wushu' version of it appeared in The One, starring Jet Li, this was not told or hinted to the viewers as part of that film's script).|$|E
