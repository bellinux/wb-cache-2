6000|$|These <b>Fer-de-lances,</b> {{be that as}} it may, are a great pest in St. Lucia. Dr. Davy {{says that}} he 'was told by the Lieutenant-Governor that as many as thirty rat-tailed snakes were killed in {{clearing}} a piece of land, of no great extent, near Government House.' I can well believe this, for about the same number were killed only two years ago in clearing, probably, the same piece of ground, which is infested with that creeping pest of the West Indies, the wild Guava- bush, from which guava-jelly is made. The present Lieutenant- Governor has offered a small reward for the head of every Fer-de- lance killed: and the number brought in, in the first month, was so large that I do not like to quote it merely from memory. Certainly, it was high time to make a crusade against these unwelcome denizens. [...] Dr. Davy, judging from a Government report, says that nineteen persons were killed by them in one small parish in the year 1849; and the death, though by no means certain, is, when it befalls, a hideous death enough. If any one wishes to know what it is like, let him read the tragedy which Sir Richard Schomburgk tells--with his usual brilliance and pathos, for he is a poet as well as a man of science--in his Travels in British Guiana, vol. ii. p. 255--how the Craspedocephalus, coiled on a stone in the ford, let fourteen people walk over him without stirring, or allowing himself to be seen: and at last rose, and, missing Schomburgk himself, struck the beautiful Indian bride, the 'Liebling der ganzen Gesellschaft;' and how she died in her bridegroom's arms, with horrors which I do not record.|$|R

25|$|Monkey River is {{a coastal}} {{watercourse}} in southern Belize that {{rises in the}} Maya Mountains and discharges to the Caribbean Sea near Monkey River Town. One of Belize's major rivers, Monkey River has northern headwaters which originate in the Cockscomb Basin Wildlife Sanctuary, where the Swasey Branch drains the East Basin of that wildlife sanctuary. Further south, the Bladen Branch watercourse drains the eastern slopes of the Maya Mountains including the ancient Mayan settlement areas of Lubaantun and Nim Li Punit. These two watercourses join to form the Monkey River approximately 16 kilometres upstream {{from the mouth of}} the Monkey River. The Monkey River is readily navigated throughout the year using small boats, but navigation above the major confluence (of Bladen and Swasey Branches) becomes more difficult due to lack of depth when the dry season starts about February. Habitats in this watershed provide cover for such diverse species as the ocelot, jaguar, Guatemalan black howler, bare-throated tiger heron, Morelet's crocodile, <b>fer-de-lance</b> and manatee.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} whether individual snakes are immune {{to their own}} venom {{has not yet been}} definitively settled, though there is a known example of a cobra which self-envenomated, resulting in a large abscess requiring surgical intervention, but showing none of the other effects that would have proven rapidly lethal in prey species or humans. Furthermore, certain harmless species, such as the North American common kingsnake (Lampropeltis getula) and the Central and South American mussurana (Clelia spp.), are proof against the venom of the crotalines which frequent the same districts, and which they are able to overpower and feed upon. The chicken snake (Spilotes pullatus) is the enemy of the <b>Fer-de-Lance</b> (Bothrops caribbaeus) in St. Lucia, and it is said that in their encounters, the chicken snake is invariably the victor. Repeated experiments have shown the European grass snake (Natrix natrix) not to be affected by the bite of the European adder (Vipera berus) and the European asp (Vipera aspis), this being due to the presence, in the blood of the harmless snake, of toxic principles secreted by the parotid and labial glands, and analogous to those of the venom of these vipers. Several North American species of rat snakes as well as king snakes have proven to be immune or highly resistant to the venom of rattlesnake species. The king cobra, which does prey on cobras is said to be immune to their venom.|$|E
500|$|Forty-seven {{species of}} snake have been {{recorded}} in Trinidad and Tobago, making the snake population of this area the most diverse in the Caribbean. Forty-four of these snake species are found in Trinidad and twenty-one in Tobago. Many of these species are South American, {{most of which are}} present in Venezuela. Trinidad and Tobago consists of two main islands, Trinidad and Tobago, and several smaller islands. [...] The Bocas Islands, which lie between Trinidad and Venezuela, in the Bocas del Dragón (Dragon's Mouths), consist of Chacachacare, Monos, Huevos and Gaspar Grande. [...] Several smaller islands lie off Trinidad, but snakes {{have been recorded}} on only one of them, Caledonia Island. [...] Snakes have been recorded on one island off Tobago, Little Tobago. Four species are venomous: two coral snake species (Micrurus spp.), the <b>fer-de-lance</b> (Bothrops atrox) and the South American bushmaster (Lachesis muta).

2500|$|After the {{publication}} of <b>Fer-de-Lance</b> in 1934, several Hollywood studios {{were interested in the}} movie rights. In one of many conversations with his authorized biographer, Rex Stout told John McAleer that he himself had wanted Charles Laughton to play Nero Wolfe: ...|$|E
2500|$|... "When Columbia {{pictures}} {{bought the}} screen rights to <b>Fer-de-Lance</b> for $7,500 and secured {{the option to}} buy further stories in the series, it was thought the role would go to Walter Connolly.

Two films presently were made by Columbia, Meet Nero Wolfe (<b>Fer-de-Lance)</b> and The League of Frightened Men. Connolly did portray Wolfe in the latter film, after Arnold decided {{he did not want}} to become identified in the public mind with one part. Lionel Stander portrayed Archie Goodwin. Stander was a capable actor but, as Archie, Rex thought he had been miscast." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some of {{the common}} names applied to this snake are terciopelo, <b>fer-de-lance,</b> Mapepire balsain (Trinidad), barba amarilla (Guatemala, Honduras; [...] "yellow beard"), equis (Ecuador & Panama; [...] "x"), [...] taya equis (Colombia), cuaima (Venezuela), nauyaca (México; from Nahuatl nahui, four, and yacatl, nose; [...] "four noses"), and yellow-jaw tommygoff (Belize).|$|E
2500|$|On April 5, 2012, the RAI {{network in}} Italy began a new Nero Wolfe series {{starring}} Francesco Pannofino as Nero Wolfe and Pietro Sermonti as Archie Goodwin.

2500|$|Lacépède {{originally}} {{applied the}} name [...] "lanceheads" [...] {{to all of}} these snakes, which he considered conspecific. Thus, older writings, as well as popular and sometimes scientific writings (including the American Heritage, Merriam-Webster, and New Shorter Oxford dictionaries), still often call them <b>fer-de-lance</b> (French, [...] "iron of the lance"). However, many scientists and hobbyists now restrict this name to the Martinican species, B. lanceolatus. Other common names include American lanceheads and American lance-headed vipers.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1930s, Stout {{turned to}} writing detective fiction. In 1933-34, he wrote <b>Fer-de-Lance,</b> which {{introduced}} Nero Wolfe {{and his assistant}} Archie Goodwin. The novel was published by Farrar & Rinehart in October 1934, and in abridged form as [...] "Point of Death" [...] in The American Magazine (November 1934). The characters of Wolfe and Goodwin are considered among Stout's main contributions to detective fiction. Wolfe was described by reviewer Will Cuppy as [...] "that Falstaff of detectives." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first novel, <b>Fer-de-Lance,</b> {{introduces}} Wolfe as {{he prepares}} to change his habits. With Prohibition at an end, he can stop buying kegs of bootleg beer and purchase it legally in bottles. Fritz brings in samples of 49 different brands for him to evaluate, from which he ultimately selects Remmers as his favorite. [...] Several times during the story, Wolfe announces his intention to reduce his beer intake from six quarts a day to five. [...] "I grinned at that, for I didn't believe it," [...] Archie Goodwin writes.|$|E
2500|$|Like Wolfe, Archie is a {{licensed}} private detective and handles all investigation {{that takes place}} outside the brownstone. He also takes care of routine tasks such as sorting the mail, taking dictation and answering the phone. At {{the time of the}} first novel, <b>Fer-de-Lance,</b> Archie had been working for Wolfe for seven years and had by then been trained by Wolfe in his preferred methods of investigation. [...] Like Wolfe, he has developed an extraordinary memory and can recite verbatim conversations that go on for hours. But perhaps his most useful attribute is his ability to bring reluctant people to Wolfe for interrogation.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{earliest}} books, Archie reports that Wolfe {{is subject to}} what he terms a [...] "relapse" [...] — {{a period of several}} days during which Wolfe refuses to work or even to listen to Archie badger him about work. The cause is unknown. Wolfe either takes to bed and eats nothing but bread and onion soup, or else he consults with Fritz on menus and the preparation of nonstop meals. In <b>Fer-de-Lance</b> (chapter 6), Archie reports that, during a relapse, Wolfe once ate half a sheep in two days, different parts cooked in 20 different ways. The relapse also appears briefly in The League of Frightened Men (chapter 11), The Red Box (chapter 6), and Where There's a Will (chapter 12), but subsequently disappears from the corpus as a plot device—possibly because Archie eventually discovered how to shut down a relapse during its earliest stages, as chronicled in The Red Box.|$|E
6000|$|Strangely enough, this snake, so {{fatal to}} man, has no power against another West Indian snake, almost equally common, namely, the Cribo. {40} This brave animal, closely {{connected}} with our common water- snake, is perfectly harmless, and a welcome guest in West Indian houses, because he clears them of rats. He is some {{six or eight}} feet long, black, with more or less bright yellow about the tail and under the stomach. He not only faces the <b>Fer-de-lance,</b> who is often as big as he, but kills and eats him. It was but last year, I think, that the population of Carenage turned out to see a fight in a tree between a Cribo and a <b>Fer-de-lance,</b> of about equal size, which, after a two hours' struggle, ended in the Cribo swallowing the <b>Fer-de-lance,</b> head foremost. But when he had got his adversary about one-third down, the Creoles--just as so many Englishmen would have done--seeing that all the sport was over, rewarded the brave Cribo by killing both, and preserving them as a curiosity in spirits. How the <b>Fer-de-lance</b> came into the Antilles is a puzzle. [...] The black American scorpion--whose bite is more dreaded by the Negroes than even the snake's--may have been easily brought by ship in luggage or in cargo. But the <b>Fer-de-lance,</b> whose nearest home is in Guiana, {{is not likely to}} have come on board ship. It is difficult to believe that he travelled northward by land at the epoch--if such a one there ever was--when these islands were joined to South America: for if so, he would surely be found in St. Vincent, in Grenada, and most surely of all in Trinidad. So far from that being the case, he will not live, it is said, in St. Vincent. For (so goes the story) during the Carib war of 1795-96, the savages imported Fer-de-lances from St. Lucia or Martinique, and turned them loose, in hopes of their destroying the white men: but they did not breed, dwindled away, and were soon extinct. It is possible that they, or their eggs, came in floating timber from the Orinoco: but if so, how is it that they have never been stranded on the east coast of Trinidad, whither timber without end drifts from that river? In a word, I have no explanation whatsoever to give; as I am not minded to fall back on the medieval one, that the devil must have brought them thither, to plague the inhabitants for their sins.|$|E
6000|$|We were, of course, {{anxious to}} obtain at St. Lucia {{specimens}} of that abominable reptile, the <b>Fer-de-lance,</b> or rat-tailed snake, {38} {{which is the}} pest of this island, {{as well as of}} the neighbouring island of Martinique, and, in Pere Labat's time, of lesser Martinique in the Grenadines, from which, according to Davy, it seems to have disappeared. It occurs also in Guadaloupe. In great Martinique--so the French say--it is dangerous to travel through certain woodlands on account of the <b>Fer-de-lance,</b> who lies along a bough, and strikes, without provocation, at horse or man. I suspect this statement, however, to be an exaggeration. I was assured that this was not the case in St. Lucia; that the snake attacks no oftener than other venomous snakes,--that is, when trodden on, or when his retreat is cut off. At all events, it seems easy enough to kill him: so easy, that I hope yet it may be possible to catch him alive, and that the Zoological Gardens may at last possess--what they have long coveted in vain--hideous attraction of a live Fer-de- lance. The specimens which we brought home are curious enough, even from this aesthetic point of view. Why are these poisonous snakes so repulsive in appearance, some of them at least, and that not in proportion to their dangerous properties? For no one who puts the mere dread out of his mind will call the Cobras ugly, even anything but beautiful; nor, again, the deadly Coral snake of Trinidad, whose beauty tempts children, and even grown people, to play with it, or make a necklace of it, sometimes to their own destruction. But who will call the Puff Adder of the Cape, or this very <b>Fer-de-lance,</b> anything but ugly and horrible: not only from the brutality signified, to us at least, by the flat triangular head and the heavy jaw, but by the look of malevolence and craft signified, to us at least, by the eye and the lip? 'To us at least,' I say. For it is an open question, and will be one, as long as the nominalist and the realist schools of thought keep up their controversy--which they will do to the world's end--whether this seeming hideousness be a real fact: whether we do not attribute to the snake the same passions which we should expect to find--and to abhor--in a human countenance of somewhat the same shape, and then justify our assumption to ourselves by the creature's bites, which are actually no more the result of craft and malevolence than the bite of a frightened mouse or squirrel. I should be glad to believe that the latter theory were the true one; that nothing is created really ugly, that the <b>Fer-de-lance</b> looks an hideous fiend, the Ocelot a beautiful fiend, merely because the outlines of the Ocelot approach more nearly to those which we consider beautiful in a human being: [...] but I confess myself not yet convinced. 'There is a great deal of human nature in man,' said the wise Yankee; and one's human nature, perhaps one's common-sense also, will persist in considering beauty and ugliness as absolute realities, in spite of one's efforts to be fair to the weighty arguments on the other side.|$|E
6000|$|Ah well, {{let them}} have their way and do their worst, since the birds are gone, and I shall go soon. It is a {{consolation}} {{to think that they}} are not my pets; that I shall not grieve, like their mistress, when their brief barking period is over; that I care just so much and no more for them than for any other living creature, not excepting the <b>fer-de-lance,</b> [...] "quoiled in the path like rope in a ship," [...] or the broad-winged vulture [...] "scaling the heavens by invisible stairs." [...] None are out of place where Nature placed them, nor unbeautiful; none are unlovable, since their various qualities--the rage of the one and the gentleness of the other--are but harmonious lights and shades in the ever-changing living picture that is so perfect.|$|E
60|$|In {{the other}} case, {{one of my}} older {{brothers}} seeing the dogs sniffing and scratching at a large burrow, took a spade and dug {{a couple of feet}} into the soil and found an adult black-and-white opossum with eight or nine half-grown young lying together in a nest of dry grass, and, wonderful to tell, a large venomous snake coiled up amongst them. The snake was the dreaded vivora de la cruz, as the gauchos call it, a pit-viper of the same family as the <b>fer-de-lance,</b> the bush-master, and the rattlesnake. It was about three feet long, very thick in proportion, and with broad head and blunt tail. It came forth hissing and striking blindly right and left when the dogs pulled the opossums out, but was killed with a blow of the spade without injuring the dogs.|$|E
60|$|The nearest of {{the moist}} green low-lying spots I have {{described}} as lying south of us, between {{our house and}} Canada Seca, was not more than twenty minutes' walk from the gate. It was a flat, oval-shaped area of about fifty acres, and kept its vivid green colour and freshness when in January the surrounding land was all of a rusty brown colour. It was to us a delightful spot to run about and play on, and though the golden plover did not come there it was haunted during the summer by small flocks of the pretty buff-coloured sandpiper, a sandpiper with the habits of a plover, one, too, which breeds in the arctic regions and spends half the year in southern South America. This green area would become flooded after heavy rains. It was then like a vast lake to us, although the water was not more than about three feet deep, and at such times it was infested with the big venomous toad-like creature called escuerzo in the vernacular, which simply means toad, but naturalists have placed it in quite a different family of the batrachians and call it Ceratophrys ornata It is toad- like in form but more lumpish, with a bigger head; it is big as a man's fist, of a vivid green with black symmetrical markings on its back, and primrose-yellow beneath. A dreadful looking creature, a toad that preys on the real or common toads, swallowing them alive just as the hamadryad swallows other serpents, venomous or not, and as the Cribo of Martinique, a big non-venomous serpent, kills and swallows the deadly <b>fer-de-lance.</b>|$|E
