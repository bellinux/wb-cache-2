40|$|International audienceFive {{mixtures}} {{of milk and}} pea protein (0 - 40 g pea protein/ 100 g total protein) were fermented by ten starter cultures of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) (2) to select the cocktails {{that can lead to}} products similar to a conventional yoghurt. Generally speaking, an increase in pea concentration leads to products with higher acidity, higher syneresis and lower firmness. From the sensory perspective, up to 30 g pea protein/ 100 g total protein, starter cultures show either positive or negative effects. A principal component analysis (PCA) (3) and a hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) (4) carried out on all variables revealed five <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>products.</b> Two <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>products</b> <b>of</b> 0 g or 10 g pea protein/ 100 g total protein seemed to be the most similar to conventional dairy products.
