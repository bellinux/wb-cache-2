5|$|There is {{evidence}} that epileptic seizures are usually not a random event. Seizures are often brought on by factors such as stress, alcohol abuse, <b>flickering</b> <b>light,</b> {{or a lack of}} sleep, among others. The term seizure threshold is used to indicate the amount of stimulus necessary to bring about a seizure. Seizure threshold is lowered in epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|In both {{of these}} works the candlelit setting had a realist justification. Viewing {{sculpture}} by candlelight, when the contours showed well and there might even be an impression of movement from the <b>flickering</b> <b>light,</b> was a fashionable practice described by Goethe. In the orrery demonstration the shadows cast by the lamp representing the sun were {{an essential part of}} the display, used to demonstrate eclipses. But there seems no reason other than heightened drama to stage the air pump experiment in a room lit by a single candle, and in two later paintings of the subject by Charles-Amédée-Philippe van Loo the lighting is normal.|$|E
25|$|Some {{animals have}} {{coloration}} {{which makes them}} highly conspicuous when outside their normal environment but highly cryptic when in it. For example, the blue morpho, a forest butterfly, has iridescent blue upper wings and a 17cm wingspan. However, because the underwings are dark, when the morpho flies through the <b>flickering</b> <b>light</b> of the forest or even out in daylight, it seems to disappear. Other forest species, especially mammals, use disruptive coloration and have spotted or striped pelage which helps break up the animal's outline. In the shade created by trees or other foliage, even large mammals such as leopards, jaguars, ocelots, and okapi are difficult to see because of such disruptive coloration.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To to {{evaluate}} the benefit of bilinear and linear fitting to characterize the retinal vessel dilation to <b>flicker</b> <b>light</b> stimulation {{for the purpose of}} risk stratification in cardiovascular disease. Methods: Forty-five patients (15 with coronary artery disease (CAD), 15 with Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and 15 with CAD and DM) all underwent contact tonometry, digital blood pressure measurement, fundus photography, retinal vessel oximetry, static retinal vessel analysis and continous retinal diameter assessment using the retinal vessel analyser (and <b>flicker</b> <b>light</b> provocation). In addition we measured blood glucose (HbA 1 c) and keratinin levels in DM patients. Results: With increased severity of cardiovascular disease a more linear reaction profile of retinal arteriolar diameter to <b>flicker</b> <b>light</b> provocation can be observed. Conclusion: Absolute values of vessel dilation provide only limited information on the state of retinal arteriolar dilatory response to <b>flicker</b> <b>light.</b> The approach of bilinear fitting takes into account the immediate response to <b>flicker</b> <b>light</b> provocation as well as the maintained dilatory capacity during prolonged stimulation. Individuals with cardiovascular disease however show a largely linear reaction profile indicating an impairment of the initial rapid dilatory response as usually observed in healty individual...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the response of}} retinal vessels to differing durations of <b>flicker</b> <b>light</b> (FL) sitmulation. Methods: We recorded retinal arterial and venous vessel dilation to 12. 5 Hz <b>flicker</b> <b>light</b> provocation (Retinal Vessel Analyzer, Imedos Systems) of varying duration (5, 7, 10 and 20 seconds) in twelve healthy young individuals (age range 26 - 45 yrs). All participants underwent a full ocular examination including intraocular pressure and blood pressure measurements. Results: Maximum dilation (MD) did not show a significant dependence on flicker duration in arteries whereas maximum constriction (MC) did. However, in veins MD significantly increased with flicker duration. Approximately 80 - 90 % of MD in arteries is reached within 10 seconds of <b>flicker</b> <b>light</b> stimulation. Conclusions: The vast majority of arterial dilatory capacity is reached within 10 seconds of <b>flicker</b> <b>light</b> stimulation even though venous dilation continues strongly. Since the MC of arteries shows a significant dependence on flicker duration measurements at two different durations can provide {{more information about the}} retinal vascular system than at a single flicker duration alone...|$|R
25|$|The first {{proposal}} {{concerning the}} effect of space radiation on the CNS was made by Cornelius Tobias in his 1952 description of light flash phenomenon caused by single HZE nuclei traversals of the retina. Light flashes, such as those described by Tobias, were observed by the astronauts during the early Apollo missions {{as well as in}} dedicated experiments that were subsequently performed on Apollo and Skylab missions. More recently, studies of light flashes were made on the Russian Mir space station and the ISS. A 1973 report by the NAS considered these effects in detail. This phenomenon, which is known as a Phosphene, is the visual perception of <b>flickering</b> <b>light.</b> It is considered a subjective sensation of light since it can be caused by simply applying pressure on the eyeball. The traversal of a single, highly charged particle through the occipital cortex or the retina was estimated to be able to cause a light flash. Possible mechanisms for HZE-induced light flashes include direction ionization and Cerenkov radiation within the retina.|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} of Des Esseintes is partly based on Huysmans himself, {{and the two}} share {{many of the same}} tastes, although Huysmans, on his modest civil-service salary, was hardly able to indulge them to the same extent as his upper-class hero. The writers and dandies Charles Baudelaire and Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly also had some influence, but the most important model was the notorious aristocratic aesthete Robert de Montesquiou, who was also the basis for Baron de Charlus in Marcel Proust's À la recherche du temps perdu. Montesquiou's furnishings bear a strong resemblance to those in Des Esseintes's house:In 1883, to his eternal regret, Montesquiou admitted Stéphane Mallarmé [...] It was late at night when the poet was shown over the house, and the only illumination came from a few scattered candelabra; yet in the <b>flickering</b> <b>light</b> Mallarmé observed that the door-bell was in fact a sacring-bell, that one room was furnished as a monastery cell and another as the cabin of a yacht, and that the third contained a Louis Quinze pulpit, three or four cathedral stalls and a strip of altar railing. He was shown, too, a sled picturesquely placed on a snow-white bearskin, a library of rare books in suitably-coloured bindings and the remains of an unfortunate tortoise whose shell had been coated with gold paint. According to Montesquiou writing many years later in his memoirs, the sight of these marvels left Mallarmé speechless with amazement. 'He went away', records Montesquiou, 'in a state of silent exaltation [...] I do not doubt therefore that it was in the most admiring, sympathetic and sincere good faith that he retailed to Huysmans what he had seen during the few moments he spent in Ali Baba's cave.' ...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Vascular dysregulation is {{considered}} to be a risk factor in several ophthalmic diseases. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reaction of retinal vessels to <b>flicker</b> <b>light</b> in otherwise healthy subjects with a vasospastic propensity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty healthy Caucasians, aged between 18 - 35 years were recruited for this study and grouped into vasospastics, based on a history of frequent cold hands, even in summer, with concordant findings in nailfold capillary microscopy, or as controls, if such a history was absent. The reaction of the retinal vascular diameter to <b>flicker</b> <b>light</b> was observed in a distance of two to three discs diameters away from the optic nerve head with the retinal vessel analyser. Three phases of <b>flicker</b> <b>light</b> of twenty seconds followed by baseline light phases of eighty seconds were recorded. The maximal vasodilatory amplitude of each flicker phase was determined and the results averaged. RESULTS: The maximal average dilatory amplitude at the arterial side reached (mean +/- SD) 2. 9 +/- 1. 7 % and 4. 8 +/- 2. 6 % of the baseline amplitude respectively in vasospastic subjects and in healthy controls (t = 2. 34; p = 0. 025). The reaction at the venous side was statistically comparable in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Otherwise healthy, vasospastic subject disclosed an altered reaction of the retinal vasculature to <b>flicker</b> <b>light</b> in this study...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{correlate}} retinal {{function with}} vascular response to <b>flicker</b> <b>light</b> in normotensive patients with diabetes without diabetic retinopathy (DR). METHODS. Twenty-eight normotensive patients with diabetes (11 with type 1, 17 with type 2) without DR and 28 sex- and age-matched healthy control subjects underwent color vision and contrast sensitivity testing, pattern, full-field, and multifo-cal electroretinography, {{and evaluation of}} the vascular re-sponse to <b>flicker</b> <b>light</b> with the dynamic vessel analyzer. RESULTS. In the patients with diabetes, electroretinogram (ERG) pattern responses, b-wave in the scotopic bright flash ERG, a-wave and b-wave in the photopic single-flash ERG, and oscil-latory potential responses were significantly impaired com-pared with those in control subjects. Vascular response to <b>flicker</b> <b>light</b> was also impaired in patients with diabetes com-pared with controls. In the whole population, correlations were found between flicker light-induced arterial retinal vaso-dilation and the amplitude and implicit time of the N 95 wave of pattern ERG (r 0. 27, P 0. 047 and r 0. 35, P 0. 008, respectively), the b-wave implicit time of rod ERG (r 0. 36; P 0. 01) and the oscillatory potentials (r 0. 4; P 0. 003), suggesting that impairment of the vascular response to <b>flicker</b> <b>light</b> may reflect inner retinal neural impairment. How-ever, no correlation between these factors was found when only patients with diabetes were considered. CONCLUSIONS. In patients with diabetes, neural and neurovascular dysfunctions both precede the onset of clinically detectable DR.
