50|$|The {{experience}} of the health professional coding a medical record is an essential variable that must be accounted for when analysing the accuracy of coding. Generally a coder {{with years of experience}} is able to extract all the relevant information from a medical record whether it is paper, scanned or semi-electronic. The diagnoses codes selected from the extraction are generally compiled and sequenced in order to represent the admission. An experienced coder may incorrectly assign codes due a lack of application of a classification systems relevant standards. An example to highlight clinical coding experience would be the standard within the Australian Coding Standards 0010 General Abstraction Guidelines. These guidelines indicate that a coder must seek further detail within a record in order to correctly assign the correct diagnoses code. An inexperienced coder may simply just use the description from the <b>discharge</b> <b>summary</b> such as Infarction and may not use the correct detail which could be further found within the details of the medical record.

50|$|The {{medical history}} or (medical) case history (also called {{epicrisis}} - typically <b>discharge</b> <b>summary</b> to referring GP, or anamnesis, especially historically) (often abbreviated hx or Hx) {{of a patient}} is information gained by a physician by asking specific questions, either of the patient or {{of other people who}} know the person and can give suitable information (in this case, it is sometimes called heteroanamnesis), with the aim of obtaining information useful in formulating a diagnosis and providing medical care to the patient. The medically relevant complaints reported by the patient or others familiar with the patient are referred to as symptoms, in contrast with clinical signs, which are ascertained by direct examination on the part of medical personnel. Most health encounters will result in some form of history being taken. Medical histories vary in their depth and focus. For example, an ambulance paramedic would typically limit their history to important details, such as name, history of presenting complaint, allergies, etc. In contrast, a psychiatric history is frequently lengthy and in depth, as many details about the patient's life are relevant to formulating a management plan for a psychiatric illness.|$|E

The routine practices of doctors involved in <b>discharge</b> <b>summary</b> construction, and other {{factors that contribute to}} the problems of delay and data quality, have been less well explored. This study aimed to gain an understanding of paper-based <b>discharge</b> <b>summary</b> construction in a secondary care context in order to identify and analyse the implications for improving electronic <b>discharge</b> <b>summary</b> systems, and potentially avoid inadvertent transfer of inherent problems. A mixed method case study design was used to examine the patient discharge process and the construction of discharge summaries in one NHS Hospital Trust. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews with hospital doctors (n= 10) and simulated <b>discharge</b> <b>summary</b> production (n= 10). A syntactic analysis was also performed on discharge summaries (n= 11) and proformas (n= 3). The data was analysed thematically and inductively in order to identify the factors that contribute to the twin problems of data quality and delay associated with discharge summaries. The pragmatic, semantic, syntactic conceptual framework (Morris, 1938), and Speech Act (Austin, 1962) and Mental Frame (Minsky, 1981) theories, were used to analyse how information contained in discharge summaries was represented, interpreted and used. This study found that moving from a paper based to an electronic <b>discharge</b> <b>summary</b> system will not necessarily resolve the problems of poor data quality and delayed production of discharge summaries. More comprehensive solutions are required in order to facilitate more effective <b>discharge</b> <b>summary</b> communication between secondary and primary care health professionals, and to address entrenched custom and practice in current hospital practice. These include uni-professional (medical) orientation of discharge summaries, attitude of senior doctors, inadequate preparation of junior doctors, inconsistent data entry including absence of common usage of short forms and abbreviations, and little accountability for quality control. Recommendations include training for junior doctors, regulating the use of shortened forms, improving the features of data entry systems, structuring the clinical coding data and introducing systems to ensure greater organizational accountability for effective discharge communication.

40|$|Queensland Health is {{implementing}} a state-wide system to electronically generate and distribute discharge summaries.

While the electronic system will address some issues (e. g. legibility and timeliness), the quality of the <b>discharge</b> <b>summary</b> content is predominantly independent of method of generation. As discharge summaries are usually generated by interns, we proposed that improvement in the quality of the summary may be achieved through education. This project aimed to compare the perceptions of hospital-based consultant educators and recipient GPs regarding <b>discharge</b> <b>summary</b> content and quality. The <b>discharge</b> <b>summary</b> and audit tool were sent to the recipient GP (n= 134) and a hospital consultant (n= 14) for satisfaction rating, using a 5 - point Likert scale for questions relating to diagnosis, the listing of clinical management, medication, pathology, investigations, and recommendations to GP. Sampling was performed by selecting up to 10 discharge summaries completed by each first-year intern (n= 36) in 2009, during the second, third and fourth rotations at the Townsville Hospital until a total of 403 was reached. Matched responses were compared using the Kappa statistic. The response rate was 93 % (n= 375) and 63 % (n= 254) for consultants and GPs respectively. Results from this study demonstrated that GPs were more satisfied with discharge summaries than were consultants. An anomaly occurred in three questions where, despite the majority of GPs rating satisfied or very satisfied, a small but proportionally greater number of GPs were very dissatisfied when compared with consultants. Poor or fair agreement between GPs and consultants was demonstrated in medications, pathology results, investigations and recommendations to GP, with GPs rating higher satisfaction in all questions. Lower consultant satisfaction ratings compared with GP ratings suggest that consultants can evaluate <b>discharge</b> <b>summary</b> content to the level required by GPs for clinical handover.
