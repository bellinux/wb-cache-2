5|$|The first {{recorded}} {{exploration of the}} Tanana Valley and the Tanana River {{did not take place}} until 1885, but historians believe Russian traders from Nulato and Hudson's Bay Company traders ventured into the lower reaches of the Tanana and possibly the Chena River {{in the middle of the}} 19th century. In 1885, Henry Tureman Allen of the U.S. Army led the {{first recorded}} expedition <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the Tanana River, charting the Chena River's mouth along the way.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 15th century, {{there was a}} formal {{ceremony}} of degradation, in which Garter King of Arms, accompanied {{by the rest of}} the heralds, proceeded to St George's Chapel. While the Garter King of Arms read aloud the Instrument of Degradation, a herald climbed up a ladder and removed the former knight's banner, crest, helm, and sword, throwing them down into the quire. Then the rest of the heralds kicked them <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the chapel, out of the doors, and into the castle ditch. The last such formal degradation was that of James, Duke of Ormonde in 1716.|$|E
5|$|Hydnellum fruitbodies have {{caps and}} stipes, often with indeterminant growth forms, that may grow in spurts and decay over several weeks. Neighboring fruitbodies can coalesce, forming {{intricately}} intertwined caps and partially fused stipes. The flesh has a zoned appearance and is fibrous when fresh, but becomes hard and woody when dry. Zones {{in the flesh}} reflect differences in growth during periods of low daytime and high nighttime humidity, and give a fairly accurate record of daily growth. The spines are crowded closely together and are typically decurrent (extending <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the stipe). Fruitbodies may display a variety of colors, from white to yellow, olive green, shades of orange, light brown, or dark brown in age.|$|E

5|$|Several {{terrestrial}} starlings, {{including those}} in the genus Sturnus, have adaptations of the skull and muscles that help with feeding by probing. This adaptation is most strongly developed in the common starling (along with the spotless and white-cheeked starlings), where the protractor muscles responsible for opening the jaw are enlarged and the skull is narrow, allowing the eye to be moved forward to peer <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the bill. This technique involves inserting the bill {{into the ground and}} opening it as a way of searching for hidden food items. Common starlings have the physical traits that enable them to use this feeding technique, which has undoubtedly helped the species spread far and wide.|$|E
5|$|The FIA {{approved}} {{minor changes}} to the layout of the Marina Bay Street Circuit ahead of the Grand Prix. The modifications ran from turn 11 to turn 13; drivers still turned right at turn 11 but it now kinked left slightly on entry, with the track shifting to the left-hand side of Fullerton Road. This changed the profile of turn 12, as drivers now used {{the other side of the}} Anderson Bridge, while the hairpin at turn 13 has been widened by a metre in order to increase overtaking opportunities. The drag reduction system (DRS) had two activation zones for the race; the first between turns five and seven <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> Raffles Boulevard, and the second on the start/finish straight between turn 23 to turn one.|$|E
5|$|The RLM had {{acquired}} {{an interest in}} rocket boosters fitted {{for the sake of}} simplicity below the wings of a heavily loaded bomber to cut <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> runway needed for takeoff. Once in the air the booster canisters would be jettisoned by parachute for reuse. The firm of Hellmuth Walter, at Kiel, handled this development. The first standing trials and tests flights of the Walter HWK 109-500 Starthilfe liquid-fueled boosters were held in 1937 at Neuhardenberg with test pilot Erich Warsitz at the controls of Heinkel He 111E bearing civil registration D-AMUE.|$|E

5|$|As {{time went}} on, their props and stage {{equipment}} became increasingly sophisticated. When {{they started to}} fill stadium sized venues and bigger, they ran into {{the problem of the}} audience no longer being able to see them due to the increased seating capacity – this problem was especially clear in their free 2006 concert in Rio de Janeiro on the A Bigger Bang tour, which used over 500 lights, hundreds of speakers, and a video screen almost 13 metres in length. Due to the vast size of the beach which the Stones performed on (2.5km), sound systems had to be set up in a relay pattern <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the beach, {{in order to keep the}} sound in sync with music from the stage; for every 340 metres of beach, the sound had to be delayed an additional second.|$|E

25|$|The {{queen snake}} {{is similar in}} {{appearance}} to a garter snake, genus Thamnophis, so is often confused with that group. The queen snake is olive to gray or dark brown in overall coloration, with peach or yellow stripes that run down its length at the first scale row. There are also four prominent ventral stripes of a darker colour, and as no other similar species has stripes running <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> its belly, {{this is an important}} feature in identifying this snake. In the young and juvenile snakes there are three extra stripes: one stripe that runs along the vertebral dorsal scales, and two stripes (one on each side) that run <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the body at scale rows five and six. These extra stripes tend to fade as the snake matures, but when young the snake will have a total of seven stripes, three on the back and four on the belly, which gives cause for its taxonomical reference name, Regina (queen) septemvittata (seven-striped). The belly of the snake is a cream to yellow colour.|$|E
25|$|Also, {{the test}} tube {{confines}} motion to the direction <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the tube, so vB is opposite to u1 and the Coriolis force is opposite to u2, that is, {{against the wall}} of the tube. If the tube is spun for a long enough time, the velocity vB drops to zero as the matter comes to an equilibrium distribution. For more details, see the articles on sedimentation and the Lamm equation.|$|E

25|$|An endolymphatic duct {{runs from}} the saccule up through the head, and ending close to the brain. In {{cartilaginous}} fish, this duct actually opens onto {{the top of the}} head, and in some teleosts, it is simply blind-ending. In all other species, however, it ends in an endolymphatic sac. In many reptiles, fish, and amphibians this sac may reach considerable size. In amphibians the sacs from either side may fuse into a single structure, which often extends <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the body, parallel with the spinal canal.|$|E
25|$|It {{is known}} that changes in {{dendritic}} excitability affect action potential back propagation. Action potentials begin near the axon hillock and propagate <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>length</b> <b>of</b> the axon, but they also propagate backward through the soma into the dendritic arbor. Active back propagation is dependent on ion channels and changing the densities or properties of these channels can influence {{the degree to which}} the signal is attenuated. Plasticity of back-propagation in the dendrites occurs in less than one minute and lasts longer than 25 minutes. Back propagation is a method of signaling to the synapses that an action potential was fired. This is important for spike-timing-dependent plasticity.|$|E
