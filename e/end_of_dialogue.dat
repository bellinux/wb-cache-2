40|$|Acts of {{resistance}} against forced displacement can manifest itself through {{a wide variety}} of social and cultural expressions. This thesis explores resistance against the dam-induced displacement in the highlands of Georgia s Svaneti region. This case study explores how the Khaishian Svans resist hydropower dam-induced displacement through practicing traditional law. The study also explores the effects of the Georgian government s lack of decision-making throughout numerous years, and how this uncertainty affect local people s lives. By employing ground-up, qualitative case study research, I found out that a) the use of traditional law by the Khaishi community, involves a strategy of asserting a convincing collective identity in the process of dealing with political claims against the authorities, and that b) the revitalization of traditional law by the resisters of Khaishi, signifies the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>dialogue</b> on displacement with the authorities, which has excluded the local community from the decision-making process from 1979 and until today...|$|E
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{relation}} to the Other - the underlying aspect of dialogism - {{in the works of}} Mikhail Bakhtin. His approach to heterology (science or knowledge of the Other) is fundamental to analysis of such themes of his oeuvre as carnival (laughter), history, and economy of human existence. On a certain stage it appears, that two configurations may be distinguished in Bakhtin's conception of the Other. First, the Other dominated and apprropriated by the subject, or Author, or Self in the dialogic relation – it is only a provisional Other. The second is the irreducible Other, outside the possibility of adequate knowledge and thus potentially excluded from dialogue. Thus, the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>dialogue,</b> the silence remains as a dark shadow on the horizon of the meaningful discursive logic. Moreover, the concepts of meaning and truth itself seem to be jeopardized here, since «answers to questions is what I call 'meanings'» (Bakhtin). Nevertheless, Bakhtin never openly questions the fundamental values of knowledge and final truth; his position may be summed up thus: «The truth is out there. Only it is probably not cognizable to an individual. Or may be not to anybody»...|$|E

40|$|Language {{shapes the}} {{practices}} and processes of energy research and policy. It is thus challenging that each disciplinary community {{has its own}} taken-for-granted terminology, which can be difficult for ‘outsiders’ to understand. Much of the interdisciplinary literature {{has focused on the}} challenges experienced in relation to this, with very little done on solutions. Moreover, most attempts to provide an overview of such (energy-related) definitions have still been undertaken within disciplinary silos and have tended to be narrow in scope (e. g. glossaries for one particular research/policy community), and have thereby failed to provide an adequate platform for cross-cutting policy debate and interdisciplinary exchange. This paper therefore aims to investigate how an interdisciplinary lexicon might be practically produced for energy researchers across the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH), as part of providing a basis for interdisciplinary collaboration and a transparent platform for subsequent policy discussions. Specifically, the core of this paper (1) identifies a set of guiding principles that may assist {{in the creation of a}} lexicon and (2) proposes a method for creating an energy-SSH lexicon. All this is discussed in the context of a new EU Platform (SHAPE-ENERGY: Social sciences & Humanities for Advancing Policy in European ENERGY), which is following this proposed method in creating its own interdisciplinary energy lexicon. We will conclude by reflecting on how a lexicon such as the one that we propose – e. g. one that is reflexive, participatory, solutions-focussed, noted as being the start (not the <b>end)</b> <b>of</b> <b>dialogue,</b> and accounts for difference, etc. – could be used more broadly in other interdisciplinary and multi-stakeholder contexts...|$|E

When other pieces on religion by Hume are taken into consideration, it may be noted that they all end with (apparently) ironic statements reaffirming the truth of Christian religious views. While the irony may be less readily evident in the Dialogues, this would suggest a similar reading <b>of</b> this work's <b>ending.</b> Cicero used a similar technique in his Dialogues.|$|R

Throughout, dialogue studies are cast as a broad field with distinct disciplines within it, as holding deep value for understanding diversity in peoples’ practices, as a potential aid in helping diverse peoples coordinate their efforts together through policies, government actions, and other institutions, and as a way of monitoring not only interactions among people but also their ecological environments.

The intent of the Conference whose Proceedings are published here was mainly to draw attention to two themes: one historical and the other more theoretical. From the historical point of view, on several occasions the name of Antisthenes has been mentioned, but not everyone was in agreement; from the theoretical point of view, one wonders what logos is able to define science and to what knowledge Socrates alludes, when at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dialogue</b> he invites Theodorus (and Theaetetus) to meet again the next morning to continue the search.

40|$|Music {{and voices}} in Pickpocket (1951), by Robert Bresson – The French {{director}} Robert Bresson {{was known for}} his creative use of sound elements and the scanty insertion of music in his films. In films produced during the intermediary phase of his career, such as A man escaped (1956), Pickpocket (1959) and Au hasard Balthazar (1966), preexisting classical music pieces, which contain formal aspects that are analogous to their distribution in the respective films, were used as non-diegetic music. Moreover, in Pickpocket, the preexisting music by Lully also relates to the voice-in and voice-over. The voice-in at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dialogues</b> usually triggers musical excerpts, which are inserted in situations of movement and whose function resembles that of divertissements in baroque opera. We also consider the relations between voice-in and voice-over and the lag between the latter and the action and the image of the main character’s diary as it is being written...|$|R
