Beginning with the Hague Rules, the various conventions set out to codify and develop the English common law principles by providing a basic set of standards to be met by the carrier; but in practice the level of protection was actually reduced because of new provisions allowing the carrier to (i) limit his liability, and (ii) rely on {{a wide array of}} <b>exemptions</b> <b>from</b> <b>liability</b> (such as [...] "Act of God", [...] "Perils of the Sea" [...] and [...] "negligence in navigation or management of the ship").|$|R

50|$|Thus, marine cargo is {{generally}} covered twice by insurance standards. The shipper or cargo-owner {{will be covered}} by a marine insurer likely with 'all risks' cover. The carrier or shipowner will {{be covered by the}} P&I club but will typically limit their liability to goods owners to {{a small fraction of the}} retail value of goods. If the cargo is lost or damaged, the cargo-owner needs to first make a claim against the shipowner. However, the shipowner may avoid liability if it did not cause the loss or if the Hague-Visby Rules grant <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>liability.</b> In that case, the cargo-owner will claim against its own insurance company. If the cargo-owner fails to claim first against the shipowner, but claims instead against its own insurance company, the insurer, having reimbursed its client, will through subrogation pursue the claim in its own right against the shipowner.|$|E

40|$|It {{is a safe}} {{assumption}} {{that every one of}} the twenty-eight EU Member States has some form of secondary liability principles within its general tort law. Traditionally, tort law principles require an element of deliberate contribution to, and therefore positive knowledge of, another person’s action. They are therefore of limited value for situations like Internet infringement, because the contributor is typically unaware of persons committing concrete acts of infringement. When the contributor merely provides the technical infrastructure that is used by an anonymous crowd for legitimate as well as illegitimate purposes, the “deliberate contribution” or “positive knowledge” element is difficult to prove. The general principles of tort law are not harmonized within Europe. However, regarding Internet services that may be misused for unlawful acts (including, but not limited to, intellectual property infringement), the E-Commerce Directive has created a legal framework for <b>exemptions</b> <b>from</b> <b>liability</b> (the safe harbor). In that regard, the E-Commerce Directive is the European equivalent of the U. S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), with the notable distinction that the E- Commerce Directive applies horizontally, thus encompassing trademark infringement...|$|R

5000|$|What {{is usually}} meant by {{assumption}} of risk is more precisely termed primary or [...] "express" [...] {{assumption of risk}}. It occurs when the plaintiff has either expressly or implicitly relieved the defendant of the duty to mitigate or relieve the risk causing the injury from which the cause of action arises. It operates as a complete bar to liability {{on the theory that}} upon assumption of the risk, {{there is no longer a}} duty of care running from the defendant to the plaintiff; without a duty owed by the defendant, there can be no negligence on his part. [...] However, primary assumption of risk is not a blanket <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>liability</b> for the operators of a dangerous activity. The specific risk causing the injury must have been known to, and appreciated by, the plaintiff in order for primary assumption of risk to apply. Also, assumption of risk does not absolve a defendant of liability for reckless conduct.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{there was}} no direct {{reference}} to the bank's employees in the relevant clause, it seemed obvious to the court that they were included in it. If the <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>liability</b> accorded by the clause were to be construed as being confined to cases in which only the acts and omissions {{of those who were}} identified as the [...] "controlling or directing minds" [...] of the bank were involved, the potential field of operation of the exemption would be so slight as not to have been worth the bank's while to insist on it. This would have left FNB entirely unprotected against liability stemming from the potential negligence or dishonesty of many thousands of employees. The bank, as an artificial, non-human entity, was obviously incapable of being negligent itself in fact. The negligence of the human beings acting as the bank's controlling minds was attributed to the bank; it could also be held vicariously liable for the negligence of ordinary employees acting in the course and within the scope of their employment. When the bank said that it was not liable [...] "whether the loss or damage was due to the bank's negligence or not," [...] it included loss or damage due to the negligence of its employees. Furthermore, the clause provided quite plainly that, even if the loss or damage was due to the bank's own negligence, attributed to it {{as a result of the}} negligence of its controlling minds or its employees, it was still immune from liability.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an economic {{justification for the}} <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>liability</b> for omissions and for the exceptions to this exemption. It interprets the differential treatment of acts and omissions in tort law {{as a proxy for}} a more fundamental distinction between harms caused by multiple injurers each of whom can single-handedly prevent the harm (either by acting or failing to act) and harms caused by a single injurer (either by acting or failing to act). Since the overall cost to which a group of injurers is exposed is constant, attributing liability to many injurers reduces the part each has to pay and consequently reduces one's incentives to take precautions. The broad <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>liability</b> for omissions is a way of carving a simple, practical rule to distinguish between the typical cases in which an agent can be easily selected and provided with sufficient incentives (typically, cases of acts) and cases {{in which there is a}} serious problem of dilution of liability (typically, cases of omissions). The exceptions to the rule exempting from responsibility for omissions are also explained in terms of efficiency. The imposition of liability for omissions depends on the ability to identify a salient agent, i. e., to single out one or few legally responsible agents and differentiate their role from that of others. Tort law designs three types of "salience rules. " It either creates salience directly (by attributing liability to a single agent), or it can exploit salience created "naturally", or it can induce injurers to create salience voluntarily. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{work offers}} some {{solutions}} to issues faced by domestic courts and arbitral tribunals when one party to a sales contract withholds {{performance on the}} ground that a trade sanction prohibits the transaction. The discussion sheds light on the authority of arbitrators to give effect to statutes serving public interests, and shows that the architecture of trade sanctions protects them from being easily dismissed. Even if a given sanction does not constitute a legal impediment justifying the defaulting party’s <b>exemption</b> <b>from</b> <b>liability,</b> the risk of penalty that this party would incur if it were to perform the contract in breach of the sanction may justify an adaptation of the contract. The heavier the penalties and the longer a sanction’s term, the more efficient the sanction, if not in achieving its ultimate political goal, certainly in preventing the performance of contracts under the initially agreed terms...|$|E

National Football League, the Seventh Circuit was {{presented}} {{with the question of}} whether the National Football League and its affiliates should be held liable for a violation of the Sherman Act as a result of the league’s exclusive apparel licensing contract with Reebok. This article traces the evolution of the Supreme Court’s intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine, which stated that even a parent company and its wholly owned subsidiary could conspire in such a way as to invoke the Sherman Act. The intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine was overturned in Copperweld Corp. v.

This article details the Seventh Circuit’s decision in American Needle Inc. and explains how the court made the right call by (1) taking an incremental look at antitrust exemptions for affiliated companies and (2) finding that the NFL and its affiliates should be treated as a single entity for the purposes of trademark licensing and therefore should not be held to have violated the Sherman Act as a result of the exclusive licensing contract...|$|R
