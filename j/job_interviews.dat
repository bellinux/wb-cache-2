It uses symbolic interactionism to examine how the different cultures of the participants may produce their differing experiences which impact on the processes and outcomes of the <b>job</b> <b>interview.</b> The paper concludes with a justification for the development of a grounded theory of culture in the <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> by examining multiple cases of the cross-cultural <b>job</b> <b>interview.</b> 20 page(s...|$|R

30|$|If <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> access {{provides}} an imperfect assessment of hiring discrimination, {{it should be}} noted that organizing interviews is costly, which encourages recruiters to interview only those applicants who actually have a real chance of obtaining the vacancy. Moreover, studies show that hiring discrimination flows directly from <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> access (Neumark et al. 1996, Kenney and Wissoker, 1994). For all these reasons, <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> access may be taken as a relevant measure of job access.|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of the <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> for both the candidate and the employer in the hiring process has been established. The <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> may be given greater weight in decisions involving recent college graduates, who often have little experience. Research has focused on behaviors related to successful interviewing, both verbal and non-verbal, and on interventions aimed at improving interview performance. Yet no intervention {{has proven to be}} significantly more effective than others. ^ The purpose of this correlational {{study was to examine the}} relationship between confidence in interviewing, knowledge of <b>interview</b> questions, and <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> performance. Confidence and knowledge are factors assumed to influence <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> performance but no research has examined the validity of this assumption or whether a relationship exists between confidence and knowledge. ^ Results showed negative relationships between knowledge of <b>interview</b> questions and <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> performance, and between knowledge of interview questions and confidence in interviewing. A positive relationship existed between confidence in <b>interviewing</b> and <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> performance. This study has significance for anyone involved in a job search, professional interviewers, and those in education [...] teachers, trainers, administrators, and curriculum planners. ...|$|R

25|$|<b>Job</b> <b>interviews</b> {{and other}} data on {{requirements}} for lower skilled workers in developed countries – particularly in the growing service sector – indicate that the more workers depend on low wages, and the less skilled or desirable their job is, the more employers screen for workers without better employment options and expect them to feign unremunerative motivation. Such screening and feigning may not only contribute to the positive self-image of the employer as someone granting desirable employment, but also signal wage-dependence by indicating the employee's willingness to feign, which in turn may discourage the dissatisfaction normally associated with job-switching or union activity.|$|E

He makes a list of firms he wants to work for, assembles a portfolio, and goes to <b>job</b> <b>interviews.</b> On day 488, Summer is waiting for Tom at his favorite spot in the city and they talk. Summer explains that Tom was right about true love existing; he was just wrong about it being with her. She says she got married because she felt sure about her husband, something she wasn't with Tom. Summer puts her hand on Tom's and says she is glad to see he is doing well. As she leaves, Tom tells her he really hopes she is happy.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 56 - 59) This {{study was}} conducted to determine whether there was a need for modification of the content in ten high school speech textbook descriptions of the <b>job</b> <b>interview.</b> Content emphasized in the textbooks was analyzed and then submitted to a jury of five personnel interviewers for validation. Textbook chapters were found to be short and injunctive, offering little elaboration on major aspects of the <b>job</b> <b>interview,</b> especially pre-interview self-appraisal by the applicant. Jury validation of an applicant's appearance and experience coincided with textbook content emphasis. The most discrepancy was in the emphasis on an applicant's references and the application form. Jury members expressed a need for more assured applicants, indicating that improvement in textbook procedural approaches to showing an applicant how to appraise himself was in order. The investigator concluded that modification of information in the textbook chapters on the <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> was necessary. A prototype chapter was devised which represents a systematic guide for teachers and students. The prototype is an original consolidation of information on the <b>job</b> <b>interview.</b> Students are motivated by participating in a "job campaign" in which they are the ???candidates???. The prototype elaborates on each aspect of the <b>job</b> <b>interview,</b> especially self-appraisal, augmenting each suggestion with examples and practice exercises which are embedded into the chapter. Material on the <b>job</b> <b>interview,</b> the investigator concluded, needs to be modified to meet the changing demands of the business world [...] and the needs of students to be adequately trained in preparing for and participating in the <b>job</b> <b>interview.</b> With the prevalence of competition and specialization in the job market, the educational institution must meet its responsibility to prepare students; intensive efforts to update information on the <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> in speech textbooks can help accomplish this...|$|R

However, after spending time with Andy at the town hall shoeshine stand where he works, April decides she wants to stay closer to him and volunteers to be Ron's assistant. She also convinces Andy to sell his band's CDs at the hall, which proves successful. When she slams the door on Tom while he tries to talk to them, Ron immediately hires her.|$|E

But the task of mastering an entire course of Engineering (around 30 undergraduate subjects) for a three-hour test, itself gives the test a certain level of toughness.

2500|$|At {{the age of}} 14, Lords became {{pregnant}} by her high school boyfriend. Afraid of her mother's reaction, she went to Hayes for help. He arranged {{for her to have}} an abortion without her mother's knowledge. Looking for a job to get some money, she was introduced to his friend and started working for her as a babysitter. The woman offered to improve Lords' job opportunities by helping her get a fake driver's license. She provided Lords with a new birth certificate on condition that if she were ever caught she would say that she had stolen the phony identification. Lords now had a new driver's license with the name Kristie Elizabeth Nussman that stated she was 22 rather than 15 years old. She was now able to line up a few <b>job</b> <b>interviews.</b> In February 1984, Lords answered a newspaper advertisement for Jim South's World Modeling Talent Agency. Posing as her stepfather, Hayes drove her to the agency. After signing a contract, she began working as a nude model and appeared in magazines such as Velvet, Juggs, and Club. During August, when she was selected to model for Penthouse magazine's 15th-anniversary issue, Lords was asked to choose a stage name. She chose Traci—one of the popular names she had longed for growing up—and Lords, after the actor Jack Lord, since she was a fan of the television series Hawaii Five-O, in which he portrayed the character of Steve McGarrett. Some of her schoolmates recognized her in the Velvet magazine pictorial. [...] Lords subsequently quit high school at age 15 and entered the sex industry, where formal education was irrelevant. The September 1984 issue, which featured Lords in a nude centerfold – she earned $5,000 for the shoot – became the best-selling issue in the history of Penthouse, partly because it also featured a nude pictorial of Vanessa Williams (appearing with George Burns on the cover photograph), who had won the Miss America Pageant the previous year. [...] Lords' article stated that she was 22 years of age, was a virgin until nineteen, and had studied interior design at El Camino College.|$|E

40|$|Unemployed {{individuals}} of pre-retirement age face significant challenges {{in finding a}} new job. This may be partly due to their lack of psychological readiness {{to go through a}} <b>job</b> <b>interview.</b> We view psychological readiness as one of the psychological attitude components. It is an active conscious readiness to interact with a certain aspect of reality, based on previously acquired experience. It includes a persons’ special competence to manage their activities and cope with anxiety. We created <b>Job</b> <b>Interview</b> Simulation Training (JIST) – a computer-based simulator, which allowed unemployed job seekers to practice interviewing repeatedly in a stress-free environment. We hypothesized that completion of JIST would be related to increase in pre-retirement job seekers’ psychological readiness for <b>job</b> <b>interviewing</b> in real life. Participants were randomized into control (n = 18) and experimental (n = 21) conditions. Both groups completed pre- and post-intervention <b>job</b> <b>interview</b> role-plays and self-reporting forms of psychological readiness for <b>job</b> <b>interviewing.</b> JIST consisted of 5 sessions of a simulated <b>job</b> <b>interview,</b> and the experimental group found it easy to use and navigate as well as helpful to prepare for interviewing. After finishing JIST-sessions the experimental group had significant decrease in heart rate during the post-intervention role-play and demonstrated significant increase in their self-rated psychological readiness, whereas the control group did not have changes in these variables. Future research may help clarify whether JIST is related to an increase in re-employment of pre-retirement job seekers...|$|R
