5|$|Emphasis {{is placed}} not on actual {{arithmetic}} computation, {{but rather on}} conceptual understanding and interpretation. The course curriculum is organized around four basic themes; the first <b>involves</b> exploring data and covers 20–30% of the exam. Students are expected to use graphical and numerical techniques to analyze distributions of data, including univariate, bivariate, and categorical data. The second theme <b>involves</b> planning and conducting a study and covers 10–15% of the exam. Students {{must be aware of}} the various methods of data collection through sampling or experimentation and the sorts of conclusions that can be drawn from the results. The third theme <b>involves</b> probability and its role in anticipating patterns in distributions of data. This theme covers 20–30% of the exam. The fourth theme, which covers 30–40% of the exam, <b>involves</b> statistical inference using point estimation, confidence intervals, and significance tests.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the anatomic pattern of disease spread at first disease relapse compared with baseline in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients who were newly diagnosed as having DLBCL between January 2004 and June 2014 who initially achieved complete remission but who eventually developed relapsed disease during follow-up were retrospectively identified. Available histological and imaging data {{were used to determine}} which nodal regions and extranodal locations were <b>involved</b> at relapse. RESULTS: A total of 21 patients with relapsed DLBCL were included, of whom 8 (38. 1 %) presented with disease relapse at previously <b>involved</b> sites only, 7 (33. 3 %) presented with disease relapse at both previously <b>involved</b> and new sites, and 6 (28. 6 %) presented with disease relapse at new sites only. A total of 57 nodal stations and 34 extranodal locations were <b>involved</b> in all 21 relapsed DLBCL patients. Of these 57 <b>involved</b> nodal regions, 47 (82. 5 %) were also <b>involved</b> at baseline, whereas 10 (17. 5 %) were not <b>involved</b> at baseline. Of the 34 <b>involved</b> extranodal locations, 17 (50. 0 %) were also <b>involved</b> at baseline, whereas 17 (50. 0 %) were not <b>involved</b> at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Relapsed DLBCL generally tends to affect previously <b>involved</b> sites, although close to one third of patients seem to have disease recurrence exclusively in previously uninvolved sites. The great majority of <b>involved</b> nodal stations at relapse are also <b>involved</b> at baseline, whereas only one half of <b>involved</b> extranodal locations at relapse are <b>involved</b> at baseline...|$|R

5|$|The game {{is divided}} into four {{different}} single-screen stages. Each represents 25 meters of the structure Donkey Kong has climbed, one stage being 25 meters higher than the previous. The final stage occurs at 100 meters. Stage one <b>involves</b> Mario scaling a construction site made of crooked girders and ladders while jumping over or hammering barrels and oil drums tossed by Donkey Kong. Stage two <b>involves</b> climbing a five-story structure of conveyor belts, each of which transport cement pans. The third stage <b>involves</b> the player riding elevators while avoiding bouncing springs. The final stage <b>involves</b> Mario removing eight rivets which support Donkey Kong. Removing the final rivet causes Donkey Kong to fall and the hero {{to be reunited with}} Pauline. These four stages combine to form a level.|$|E
