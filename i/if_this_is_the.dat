40|$|Why {{do people}} get sick? Consider {{the case of}} Julia, a 50 -year old lawyer who goes to her doctor {{complaining}} of stomach pains. After ordering some tests, the doctor tells here {{that she has a}} gastric ulcer. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> 1950 s, the doctor would probably tell her that she needs to take it easy and drink more milk. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> 1970 s o...|$|R

5|$|Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Law at Queen Mary, University of London, {{suggests}} {{the potential for}} a third class of secret trust. This is where the dying person is encouraged not to make a will so that his property passes to the next-of-kin, on the agreement that the next-of-kin give effect to his wishes via a secret trust. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> case, the next-of-kin would be obliged to hold the property on trust and fulfil the dying person's wishes.|$|E
2500|$|Yet <b>this</b> rephrasing <b>is</b> itself {{equivalent}} to the statement Any plane contains a point. [...] <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> essence of the statement, Baez noted, it cannot be very useful in [...] "explaining the origin of inertia".|$|R
2500|$|<b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> case, Sejong's evasion on the Mongol {{connection}} can {{be understood}} in light of Korea's relationship with Ming China {{after the fall of}} the Mongol Yuan dynasty, and of the literati's contempt for the Mongols as [...] "barbarians".|$|R
50|$|Another {{proposed}} {{explanation is}} that Valentich became disoriented and was flying upside down. What he thought he saw, <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> case, would <b>be</b> his own aircraft's lights reflected in the water. He would then have crashed into the water.|$|R
5|$|An {{inscription}} {{dating to}} AD 830 mentions the last known ruler of Machaquilá, {{which may be}} evidence of a long-standing {{relationship between the two}} sites. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> case, then Machaquilá appears to have been the dominant city out of the two. Seibal Stela 10, dating to roughly 849 AD, has an inscription naming Kan Ek' as ruler of Motul de San José, which is recorded as being one of the four paramount polities in the mid-9th century (ca. 849), along with Calakmul, Tikal and Seibal itself.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Spanish Conquest, the main Mam {{population}} was situated in Xinabahul (also spelled Chinabjul), now the city of Huehuetenango. They retreated to Zaculeu as a refuge during the Spanish attacks because of its fortifications. The refuge was attacked by Gonzalo de Alvarado y Contreras, brother of conquistador Pedro de Alvarado, in 1525, with 120 soldiers, and some 2,000 Mexican and K'iche' allies. The city was defended by Kayb'il B'alam commanding some 5,000 people (the chronicles are not clear <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> number of soldiers or the total population of Zaculeu).|$|E
5|$|Because {{high levels}} of jitter have been {{detected}} in the spectrum of HAT-P-33, the ability to collect the most sensitive radial velocity measurements possible has been dulled. The loss of accuracy has prevented astronomers from disregarding the possibility that HAT-P-33 is actually a binary star, where the secondary, dimmer companion is visually indistinguishable from the brighter primary companion. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> case, then the dimmer star in the HAT-P-33 system {{would have to have}} a mass that is less than 0.55 times that of the Sun. A search for a binary companion star using adaptive optics at the MMT Observatory was negative.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> unicast message <b>is</b> {{not using}} a control {{transmission}} mechanism. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> {{case and the}} message would not have <b>been</b> received, <b>the</b> discoverer mote would not take account of this neighbour mote when defining its neighbourhood, and the algorithm would work properly.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> castle's {{location}} <b>was</b> ostensibly {{chosen to}} protect England's south coast from raids by the French.

5|$|Despite {{its initial}} plausibility, the {{identity}} theory faces a strong {{challenge in the}} form of the thesis of multiple realizability, first formulated by Hilary Putnam. It is obvious that not only humans, but many different species of animals can, for example, experience pain. However, it seems highly unlikely that all of these diverse organisms with the same pain experience are in the identical brain state. And <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> case, then pain cannot be identical to a specific brain state. The identity theory is thus empirically unfounded.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Putnam's {{internal}} realism {{has been}} accused by Curtis Brown of being a disguised form of subjective idealism. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> case, it {{is subject to the}} traditional arguments against that position. In particular, it falls into the trap of solipsism. That is, if existence depends on experience, as subjective idealism maintains, and if one's consciousness were to stop existing, then the rest of the universe would stop existing as well.|$|E
5|$|Given its size, rock/ice {{composition}} {{and the possible}} presence of salt or ammonia in solution to lower the freezing point of water, Ariel's interior may be differentiated into a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> case, the radius of the core (372km) is about 64% of the radius of the moon, and its mass is around 56% of the moon's mass—the parameters are dictated by the moon's composition. The pressure {{in the center of}} Ariel is about 0.3GPa (3kbar). The current state of the icy mantle is unclear, although the existence of a subsurface ocean is considered unlikely.|$|E
50|$|During {{the peace}} {{negotiations}} between {{his father and}} Erispoe, duke of Brittany, Louis was betrothed to an unnamed daughter of Erispoe in 856. It <b>is</b> not known <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> same daughter who later married Gurivant. <b>The</b> contract <b>was</b> broken in 857 after Erispoe's murder.|$|R
50|$|He wakes {{back in his}} own time, {{and tries}} to {{convince}} his friends there {{that he was not}} simply dreaming. He remembers that he had buried his dagger, and eventually unearths a corroded knife, but it <b>is</b> not clear <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> one he buried.|$|R
25|$|Perhaps one effect {{underlying}} <b>this</b> common misconception <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{fact that}} <b>the</b> color restriction <b>is</b> not transitive: a region {{only has to}} be colored differently from regions it touches directly, not regions touching regions that it touches. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> restriction, planar graphs would require arbitrarily large numbers of colors.|$|R
5|$|The restorers {{took for}} granted {{that all of the}} layers of grease and soot on the ceiling were the result of candle smoke. Contrary to this view, James Beck and {{numerous}} artists have suggested that Michelangelo used carbon black in a wash of glue to lay on shadows and crisp dark definition, a secco. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> case, then the greater part was removed in the restoration.|$|E
5|$|Umbriel may be {{differentiated}} into a rocky core {{surrounded by}} an icy mantle. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> case, the radius of the core (317km) is about 54% of the radius of the moon, and its mass is around 40% of the moon’s mass—the parameters are dictated by the moon's composition. The pressure {{in the center of}} Umbriel is about 0.24GPa (2.4kbar). The current state of the icy mantle is unclear, although the existence of a subsurface ocean is considered unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Ariel {{appears to}} be fairly evenly cratered {{compared}} to other moons of Uranus; the relative paucity of large craters suggests that its surface does not date to the Solar System's formation, which means that Ariel must have been completely resurfaced at some point of its history. Ariel's past geologic activity {{is believed to have}} been driven by tidal heating at a time when its orbit was more eccentric than currently. The largest crater observed on Ariel, Yangoor, is only 78km across, and shows signs of subsequent deformation. All large craters on Ariel have flat floors and central peaks, and few of the craters are surrounded by bright ejecta deposits. Many craters are polygonal, indicating that their appearance was influenced by the preexisting crustal structure. In the cratered plains there are a few large (about 100km in diameter) light patches that may be degraded impact craters. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> case they would be similar to palimpsests on Jupiter's moon Ganymede. It has been suggested that a circular depression 245km in diameter located at 10°S 30°E is a large, highly degraded impact structure.|$|E
30|$|Subsequently, {{we examine}} whether the {{differences}} in returns to human capital endowments can solely explain the rural–urban wage gap. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> case, we can conclude that wage differentials <b>are</b> due to <b>the</b> difference in workers’ characteristics, not firms’ characteristics, and derive implications for policy to address rural-to-urban migration.|$|R
50|$|Another {{theory about}} <b>the</b> {{illusion}} <b>is</b> that it occurs due to aberrations of perceptual mechanisms. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> case, the effect would not require such specific conditions to occur and would often be perceived when viewing colors under normal conditions. This reasoning works to discount chromatic aberration as the cause.|$|R
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that COX-2 selectivity could cause imbalance of prostaglandins in <b>the</b> vasculature. [...] <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> explanation for the increased cardiovascular risk then low-dose aspirin should negate <b>this</b> effect, which <b>was</b> not <b>the</b> case in the APPROVe trial. Also, the non-selective COX inhibitors, have also shown increase in cardiovascular events.|$|R
5|$|Gregory {{participated in}} the First Council of Constantinople (381), and perhaps gave there his famous sermon In suam ordinationem. He was chosen to eulogise at the funeral of Melitus, which {{occurred}} during the council. The council sent Gregory {{on a mission to}} Arabia, perhaps to ameliorate the situation in Bostra, where two men, Agapius and Badagius, claimed to be bishop. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> case, Gregory was unsuccessful, as the see was still contested in 394. He then travelled to Jerusalem, where Cyril of Jerusalem faced opposition from local clergy {{due to the fact that}} he had been ordained by Acacius of Caesarea, an Arian heretic. Gregory's attempted mediation of the dispute was unsuccessful, and he himself was accused of holding unorthodox views on the nature of Christ. His later reign in Nyssa was marked by conflict with his Metropolitan, Helladius. Gregory was present at a 394 synod convened at Constantinople to discuss the continued problems in Bostra. The year of his death is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Hans Asperger {{described}} common symptoms {{among his}} patients' family members, especially fathers, and research supports this observation and suggests a genetic contribution to Asperger syndrome. Although no specific gene {{has yet been}} identified, multiple factors are believed {{to play a role}} in the expression of autism, given the phenotypic variability seen in children with AS. Evidence for a genetic link is the tendency for AS to run in families and an observed higher incidence of family members who have behavioral symptoms similar to AS but in a more limited form (for example, slight difficulties with social interaction, language, or reading). Most behavioral genetic research suggests that all autism spectrum disorders have shared genetic mechanisms, but AS may have a stronger genetic component than autism. There is probably a common group of genes where particular alleles render an individual vulnerable to developing AS; <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> case, the particular combination of alleles would determine the severity and symptoms for each individual with AS.|$|E
5|$|Many of Poe's conclusions, however, are {{speculative}} {{due to his}} {{rejection of}} analytic logic and emphasis on intuition and inspiration. Further, Eureka contains many scientific errors. In particular, Poe's suggestions opposed Newtonian principles regarding the density and rotation of planets. He also says that Johannes Kepler came to his conclusions not through science but through guesswork. For this reason, {{it has been suggested}} that what Poe demands is true in Eureka is not actually about this universe, but a parallel fictitious one Poe creates. <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> case, as interpreted by poet Richard Wilbur, Poe is criticizing this world, suggesting it has fallen away from God by elevating scientific reason above poetic intuition.|$|E
50|$|Clavaporania fitchorum {{has been}} found during a deep-sea survey by the US Antarctic Research Program at Hjort Seamount, {{off the coast of}} Macquarie Island, at 1600 meters deep. Even <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> only {{recorded}} observation to date, this species may have a large distribution, as it <b>is</b> often <b>the</b> case with deep-sea species.|$|R
