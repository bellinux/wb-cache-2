5|$|On January 31, 2008, Dutch crime {{reporter}} Peter R. de Vries {{claimed that}} he had solved the Holloway case. De Vries stated that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> all on a special television program on Dutch television on February 3. On February 1, the Dutch media reported that Van der Sloot made a confession regarding the disappearance of Holloway. Later that day, Van der Sloot stated that {{he was telling the}} individual what he wanted to hear, and that he had no role in her disappearance. That same day, the Aruba prosecutor's office announced the reopening of the case.|$|E
5|$|Former Georgetown University {{basketball}} coach John Thompson had originally booked a ticket on Flight 77. As <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> the story {{many times in}} the following years, including a September 12, 2011 interview on Jim Rome's radio show, he had been scheduled to appear on that show on September 12, 2001. Thompson was planning to be in Las Vegas for a friend's birthday on September 13, and initially insisted on traveling to Rome's Los Angeles studio on the 11th. However, this did not work for the show, which wanted him to travel {{on the day of the}} show. After a Rome staffer personally assured Thompson that he would be able to travel from Los Angeles to Las Vegas immediately after the show, Thompson changed his travel plans. He felt the impact from the crash at his home near the Pentagon.|$|E
5|$|In March 1918, as the Bolshevik {{government}} {{concluded a}} separate {{peace with the}} Central Powers, the Germans occupied the Donbas and Khrushchev fled to Kalinovka. In late 1918 or early 1919 he was mobilized into the Red Army as a political commissar. The post of political commissar had recently been introduced as the Bolsheviks came to rely less on worker activists and more on military recruits; its functions included indoctrination of recruits in the tenets of Bolshevism, and promoting troop morale and battle readiness. Beginning as commissar to a construction platoon, Khrushchev rose to become commissar to a construction battalion and was sent from the front for a two-month political course. The young commissar came under fire many times, though many of the war stories <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> in later life dealt more with his (and his troops') cultural awkwardness, rather than with combat. In 1921, the civil war ended, and Khrushchev was demobilized and assigned as commissar to a labor brigade in the Donbas, {{where he and his}} men lived in poor conditions.|$|E

5|$|The spy {{followed}} the court mystic to Mount Tai, where he performed a ritual with his followers, {{although no one}} saw any immortals. Luan Da ordered his followers to stay behind while he went ahead to meet the immortals, telling them that the spiritual beings would not descend to meet with lowly servants. The spy tailed Luan Da as he went forth alone, but only saw the mystic walk along the beach. Luan Da returned to his group and {{reported that he had}} seen his immortal master and that they were to report back to the emperor. Angered by Luan Da's deceit, the spy rushed back to the capital before the mystic to inform Emperor Wu. The emperor, incensed at Luan Da's confidence tricks, decided to play along when the mystic returned to see what lies <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{young man}} was not certain if he should accept the offer Freddy Carlone had made, so he {{returned}} to Canonsburg to talk the matter over with his father. Perry expected <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> {{him to stay in}} the barber business, but to his surprise, the senior Como told him if he did not take the opportunity, he might never know whether or not he could be a professional singer. The decision was also made with an eye on finances; Como earned around $125 per week from his barber shop while the job with Carlone paid $28 per week. Roselle was willing to travel with her husband and the band, but the salary was not enough to support two people on the road. Perry and Roselle were married in Meadville on July 31, 1933; four days later, Como joined Freddy Carlone's band and began working with them. Roselle returned home to Canonsburg; her new husband would be on the road for the next 18 months.|$|E

25|$|According to hitman-turned-informant Charles Crimaldi, {{one time}} DeStefano made his wife Anita take {{his gun and}} put {{the end of the}} barrel in her mouth, then demanded that she pull the trigger. When she pulled the trigger and the gun didn't go off, DeStefano began to laugh and told her that he had removed the bullets. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> this story over and over again to his mob {{associates}} for amusement.|$|E
25|$|The SADC {{postponed}} {{a meeting}} of its defence committee indefinitely until Mbeki could finalise a unity deal in Zimbabwe; while confirming that he would attend the meeting, Mbeki told journalists that, if the deal fell through at the last minute, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> the SADC {{that he had done}} his best as mediator, and that the deal would fall through because {{one or more of the}} parties were not serious about the negotiations.|$|E
25|$|Civil service reformers {{held out}} {{hope for the}} second Cleveland {{administration}} but saw Vice President Stevenson {{as a symbol of}} the spoils system. He never hesitated to feed names of Democrats to the Post Office Department. Once he called at the US Treasury Department to protest against an appointment and was shown a letter he had written endorsing the candidate. Stevenson told the treasury officials not to pay attention to any of his written endorsements; if he really favored someone <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> them personally.|$|E

25|$|Nicholas II always remembered George and his {{wonderful}} {{sense of}} humour. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> great jokes that amused his brother very much. Nicholas would dutifully write {{out the best}} jokes on pieces of paper and save them in a box. Years later, the Tsar would be heard laughing by himself in his room, looking through his old box of George's jokes. George's title as Heir Presumptive was passed to his younger brother, Michael, until the birth, in 1904, of Nicholas' son, Alexei. In 1910, Michael named his newborn son, George, after his late brother. This George would also die young; {{he was killed in}} a car crash in 1931 at the age of 20.|$|E
25|$|M.D. William E. Seidelman is a {{professor}} from the University of Toronto who in collaboration with Dr. Howard Israel of Columbia University published a report on an investigation on the Medical experimentations performed in Austria under the Nazi Regime. In that report he mentions a Doctor Hermann Stieve, whom used the war to experiment on live humans. Dr. Stieve specifically focused on the reproductive system of women. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> women their execution date in advanced, and he would evaluate how their psychological distress would affect their menstruation cycles. After they were murdered, he would dissect and examine their reproductive organs. Some {{of the women were}} even raped after they were told the date when they would be killed, so that Dr. Stieve could study the path of sperm through their reproductive system.|$|E
25|$|Syed Qutb from a {{young age}} would save up his money for a man called Amsaalih, who used to sell books around the local villages. He would have a big {{collection}} of books, and another small collection specifically for Syed Qutb. If Syed never had the money, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> him that I don't have the money now, so let me borrow it and I'll give it you next time you come around. And Amsaalih would let him do that. At the age of 12, {{he had his own}} library collection of 25 books, even though books were really expensive during that time. He would imitate the scholars by reading the books, and then give lectures {{to the rest of the}} village. If any women needed any information, they would wait till Syed Qutb came back from school, and ask him to share the knowledge he had to them. In many occasions he would be shy because he was a young man, but in some occasions he would go and teach the knowledge he had to the people who asked him.|$|E

25|$|Kawabata {{apparently}} {{committed suicide}} in 1972 by gassing himself, {{but a number of}} close associates, including his widow, consider his death to have been accidental. One thesis, as advanced by Donald Richie, was that he mistakenly unplugged the gas tap while preparing a bath. Many theories have been advanced as to his potential reasons for killing himself, among them poor health (the discovery that he had Parkinson's disease), a possible illicit love affair, or the shock caused by the suicide of his friend Yukio Mishima in 1970. Unlike Mishima, Kawabata left no note, and since (again unlike Mishima) he had not discussed significantly in his writings the topic of taking his own life, his motives remain unclear. However, his Japanese biographer, Takeo Okuno, has related how he had nightmares about Mishima for two or three hundred nights in a row, and was incessantly haunted by the specter of Mishima. In a persistently depressed state of mind, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> friends during his last years that sometimes, when on a journey, he hoped his plane would crash.|$|E
500|$|Muntz {{developed}} a television chassis that produced an acceptable monochrome picture with 17tubes. He often carried {{a pair of}} wire clippers, and when he thought {{that one of his}} employees was [...] "overengineering" [...] a circuit, he would begin snipping components out until the picture or sound stopped working. At that point, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> the engineer [...] "Well, I guess you have to put that last part back in" [...] and walk away.|$|E
500|$|After {{the first}} part of the ballet {{received}} two full orchestral rehearsals in March, Monteux and the company departed to perform in Monte Carlo. Rehearsals resumed when they returned; the unusually large number of rehearsals—seventeen solely orchestral and five with the dancers—were fit into the fortnight before the opening, after Stravinsky's arrival in Paris on 13 May. The music contained so many unusual note combinations that Monteux had to ask the musicians to stop interrupting when they thought they had found mistakes in the score, saying <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> them if something was played incorrectly. According to Doris Monteux, [...] "The musicians thought it absolutely crazy". At one point—a climactic brass fortissimo—the orchestra broke into nervous laughter at the sound, causing Stravinsky to intervene angrily.|$|E

500|$|Because Johnston was {{believed}} to be safe at the ColdwaterII observation post, the fact that he died shocked his friends and co-workers alike. However, most of his colleagues and family asserted that Johnston died [...] "doing what he wanted to do." [...] His mother stated in an interview shortly after the eruption, [...] "Not many people get to do what they really want to do in this world, but our son did.... <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> us he may never get rich but he was doing what he wanted. He wanted to be near if the eruption came. In a phone call on Mother's Day, he told us it's a sight very few geologists get to see." [...] Dr. Stephen Malone agreed that Johnston died doing what he loved, and stated that he [...] "was very good at his work".|$|E
500|$|Soderbergh {{has said}} that with Che, {{he wanted to show}} {{everyday}} tasks, [...] "things that have meaning on a practical level and on an ideological level", as a [...] "way of showing what it might have been like to be there". While addressing the issue after at the Toronto International Film Festival, Soderbergh remarked {{that he was trying to}} avoid what he felt were typical scenes for a biographical film and that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> screenwriter Peter Buchman, that he was [...] "trying to find the scenes that would happen before or after the scene that you would typically see in a movie like this". Soderbergh was not interested in depicting Guevara's personal life because he felt that [...] "everybody on these campaigns has a personal life, they all left families behind, that doesn't make him special and why should I go into his personal life and nobody else's?" ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{backwards}} guitar solo, Frusciante {{was filmed}} waving a large aluminum ribbon; Kiedis was initially apprehensive about Sednaoui's {{desire for the}} guitarist to do so, believing <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>tell</b> the director [...] "'Fuck you and take that dancing ribbon and shove it up your French ass, buddy' but [...] gladly went off and made love to the air with this dancing ribbon. He would have danced around for hours with that thing." [...] The footage was edited in reverse to complement the solo. While some of the scenes in the video were planned with a storyboard, {{much of it was}} improvised or made up on the spot over the two-day shoot. During a particular scene Kiedis began to move his tongue flamboyantly to dramatically accentuate the lyrics, which Sednaoui believed was extremely beneficial to the exuberant nature of the video. Where the video begins in {{what appears to be the}} daytime, it concludes at dusk with silhouettes of the band members running into the setting sun.|$|E
