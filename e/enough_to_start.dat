Defender Jaap Stam, who signed for United in May 1998, made his competitive debut for the club, partnering centre-back Ronny Johnsen. For Arsenal, new signing Nelson Vivas began the match on the substitutes' bench, in spite of being expected to make his full debut, while Dennis Bergkamp started alongside Nicolas Anelka up front.|$|E
5|$|Alan and Barry {{start to}} learn about the past of Cauldron Lake from other townsfolk. They believe an entity called the Dark Presence is trapped within the lake and is trying to escape by using its powers to turn fiction into reality. It has {{previously}} tried this with a writer known as Thomas Zane—the figure in the diving suit—but Zane was able to resist its will and died during the eruption that sank the island. The Dark Presence has grown strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> to influence the townspeople and create the forces that have chased Alan. That night, as Alan and Barry take shelter, they get drunk on moonshine, and Alan starts to recall memories of being forced to write Departure during the prior week, and realizes that the Dark Presence is now trying to use his writings to escape.|$|E

He underwent surgery but remained healthy <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> his new position as color analyst for the New Jersey Devils radio broadcasts. In 1987 Shero decided he wanted to experience coaching in Europe and spent one season coaching Tilburg Trappers in the Netherlands. With his health declining Shero returned to the Flyers' organization as a special assistant in 1989. The reunion was to help him with his medical costs, but it was also something that was very important to Shero on a personal level, as it was a return to the organization he had the most success with. On March 22, 1990, Shero was elected into the Flyers' Hall of Fame. Eight months later on November 24, Shero died at Cooper Hospital in Camden, New Jersey. He was 65.|$|E

Eventually she accepts her relationship with Riggs, but it's complicated by the unexpected return of Owen's sister, Megan Hunt, Riggs' fiancée. Meredith finds herself in another love triangle when Megan rejects Riggs because he is still in love with Meredith, but Meredith pushes them to be together. After her relationship with Riggs ends, Meredith is nominated for a Harper Avery Award for her groundbreaking surgery on Megan. In the penultimate 300th episode, after failing to attend the award ceremony to stay for a medical trauma, post surgery Meredith learns with all her closest friends in the OR room thag she has won the Harper Avery Award.|$|E
5|$|The initial squad was {{selected}} for the British team on 14 July; however, the final team was not confirmed until {{the outcome of a}} courtcase involving Dwain Chambers. Under the rules of the BOA, Chambers had been banned from future Games after testing positive for the steroid THG in 2003. His appeal to overturn that ban, {{on the grounds that it}} was an unfair restraint of trade, failed and he was omitted from the squad. The team included former Olympic medal winners Marlon Devonish and Kelly Sotherton, as well as former Olympic individual finalists Joanne Pavey, Paula Radcliffe, Helen Clitheroe and Tasha Danvers. Women's marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe faced a battle to be fit for the Games due to a stress fracture in her left thigh. She eventually proved fit <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> the race but struggled to finish in 23rd position.|$|E
5|$|When meeting {{another of}} the same species, P. fimbriata does not stalk but {{displays}} by moving quickly and smoothly, and displays at 4 to 27centimetres away. It raises its legs, its body sways from side to side, and the palps are lowered below the chelicerae ("fangs"). This {{is very different from}} the stalking it uses when encountering another salticid of a different species, despite receiving the same visual stimulus, the sight of the other's large anterior-median eyes. Although P. fimbriata is influenced by pheromones much more than is usual among salticids, visual cues alone are <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> displays and distinguish members of the same species from other salticids, even if neither partner moves. The spindly, fringed legs of Portia species may identify members of the same species, as well as concealing these spiders from other salticid species.|$|E

While it was still possible to board the lifeboats on the port side, lowering them presented a different problem. As was typical for the period, the hull plates of Lusitania were riveted, and as the lifeboats were lowered they dragged on the inch high rivets, which threatened to seriously damage the boats before they landed in the water.|$|E
25|$|Brady {{attended}} Junípero Serra High School in San Mateo, {{where he}} graduated in 1995; the ceremony was held at St. Mary's Cathedral. He played football, basketball, and baseball in high school. He played against Bellarmine College Preparatory rival Pat Burrell in both football and baseball. Brady's football career started as the backup quarterback on the Padres junior varsity team. At first, Brady was not good <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> on the 0–8 JV team that had not scored a touchdown all year. However, when the starting quarterback went down with an injury, he ascended to the starting position. He became the varsity starter his junior year and held the position until he graduated. By Brady's senior year, he struggled getting on the radar of college coaches. He created highlight tapes and sent them out to schools he would consider attending. This led to strong interest from many football programs around the nation.|$|E
25|$|Healthcare in Iran {{is based}} on three pillars: the public-governmental system, the private sector, and NGOs. The {{healthcare}} and medical sector's market value in Iran was almost US $24 billion in 2002 and is forecast to rise to US $96 billion in 2017. With a population of 80 million (2017), Iran {{is one of the}} most populous countries in the Middle East. The country faces the common problem of other young demographic nations in the region, which is keeping pace with growth of an already huge demand for various public services. The young population will soon be old <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> new families, which will boost the population growth rate and subsequently the need for public health infrastructures and services. Total healthcare spending is expected to rise from $24.3 billion in 2008, to $96 billion by 2017, reflecting the increasing demand on medical services. Total health spending was equivalent to 6% of GDP in Iran in 2017. About 90% of Iranians have some form of health insurance. Iran is also the only country with a legal organ trade. However, the legal character of organ donations is deemed to be a gifting of organs and not their sale and purchase.|$|E

25|$|United {{went into}} the second leg {{with a couple of}} injury {{concerns}} in the centre of their defence. Nemanja Vidić was still carrying an injury from the first leg, while Rio Ferdinand had a suspected foot injury that he picked up in the Reds' match against Middlesbrough at the weekend. Nevertheless, Ferdinand was deemed to be fit <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> the match, and lined up alongside Gerard Piqué in the centre of defence. Mikaël Silvestre also found a place in the starting lineup, making his first start for nearly seven months, following a knee ligament injury, and Gary Neville also made a return to the first team squad, being selected on the bench. Meanwhile, Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Paul Scholes were left on the bench, as Alex Ferguson obviously had an eye on the following weekend's match against Arsenal. Manchester United started the match brightly, creating numerous opportunities in the first few minutes. However, on the half-hour, the referee Tom Henning Øvrebø awarded the visiting side a penalty for a trip on Mancini by Wes Brown, which Daniele De Rossi stepped up to take. Live action replays however showed no contact between Brown and Mancini. Fortunately for United, the Italian midfielder blazed the ball over the crossbar, wasting what would end up being Roma's best chance of getting back into the tie.|$|E
