5|$|The Croatian form Crljenak Kaštelanski was not bottled in Croatia as a varietal in its {{own right}} before the link to Zinfandel was revealed. UCD has since sent clones of both Zinfandel and Primitivo to Professor Maletić in Croatia, which he planted on the island of Hvar. He made his first ZPC wines in Croatia in 2005. There is high demand for red grapes in the country, and the {{government}} has been supportive of ongoing research. Figures from the department of viticulture and <b>enology</b> at the University of Zagreb claim that from only 22 vines of Crljenak Kaštelanski in Croatia in 2001, there were about 2,000 vines in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The grape's true origins were {{discovered}} in 1996 {{with the use of}} DNA typing at the UC Davis Department of Viticulture and <b>Enology,</b> by a team led by Dr. Carole Meredith. The DNA evidence determined that Cabernet Sauvignon was the offspring of Cabernet franc and Sauvignon blanc and was most likely a chance crossing that occurred in the 17th century. Prior to this discovery, this origin had been suspected from the similarity of the grapes' names and the fact that Cabernet Sauvignon shares similar aromas with both grapes—such as the blackcurrant and pencil box aromas of Cabernet franc and the grassiness of Sauvignon blanc. In 2016 scientists at the UC Davis announced they had sequenced a draft of the whole genome of the Cabernet Sauvignon grape, the first genome of a commercial wine-producing grape to be sequenced.|$|E

25|$|Some countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, have wine {{labeling}} {{laws that}} {{require the use of}} fining agents that may be an allergenic substance to appear on the wine label. A study conducted by the University of California, Davis Department of Viticulture and <b>Enology,</b> however, found that no detectable amount of inorganic fining agents, and only trace quantities of proteinaceous agents, are left in the wine.|$|E
25|$|Syrah {{has a long}} {{documented}} {{history in}} the Rhône region of southeastern France, {{but it was not}} known if it had originated in that region. In 1998, a study conducted by Carole Meredith's research group in the Department of Viticulture and <b>Enology</b> at University of California, Davis used DNA typing and extensive grape reference material from the viticultural research station in Montpellier, France to conclude that Syrah was the offspring of the grape varieties Dureza (father) and Mondeuse blanche (mother).|$|E
25|$|Twin {{brothers}} Ted and Terry Casteel founded Bethel Heights {{with their}} partners {{and other family}} members in 1997. The Casteel brothers graduated from Whitworth University in Spokane, Washington with Ted going on to teach European History at the University of Michigan-Dearborn and Terry working as a clinical psychologist in Seattle. Soon after the Casteel purchased the vineyard, Ted went to study viticulture at the University of California-Davis while Terry did apprentice work at various Willamette Valley wineries. In 2010, Terry Castel was honored by Salud! for his contribution to the Oregon Pinot wine industry. Ted has become an industry leader when it comes to sustainable viticulture, co-founding the Low Input Viticulture and <b>Enology</b> (LIVE) certification program in Oregon.|$|E
25|$|Daniel Baron (born 1949) is an American winemaker. He is {{best known}} for his work with the Duncan family-owned Silver Oak Cellars and Twomey Cellars, and is Director of Winemaking for both. Originally a field worker for John Rolleri at Chateau Montelena, he gained {{experience}} in the Bordeaux region of France and was mentored by the likes of grape geneticist Professor Harold Olmo, and winemakers Jean-Claude Berrouet and Justin Meyer. He became general manager of Christian Moueix's Dominus Estate in the 1980s. He became winemaker for Silver Oak, an exclusive Cabernet Sauvignon producer, in 1994, and was trained by Justin Meyer to follow in his footsteps as Silver Oak's winemaker before Meyer’s retirement in 2001. In 1999, Baron was instrumental in persuading the Duncans to establish Twomey to pursue Merlot, Pinot noir, and Sauvignon blanc after discovering high quality Merlot grapes on Silver Oak’s Soda Canyon Ranch Vineyard. He has served on boards such as the American Society of <b>Enology</b> and Viticulture and the Napa Valley Wine Technical Group.|$|E

2500|$|The winery {{has earned}} a {{reputation}} in the Oregon wine industry as a pioneer in [...] "sensible and sustainable" [...] viticulture with co-founder and vineyard manager Ted Casteel leading the efforts to create the Low Input Viticulture and <b>Enology</b> (LIVE) certification program. At the vineyard, Casteel and his daughter and viticulturist Mimi Casteel utilize elements of both organic and biodynamic viticulture practices that minimizes the use of synthetic chemicals in the vineyard. This includes using sulfur sprays (similar to the Bordeaux mixture) until post-bloom. Later in the season they do use some synthetic products for reliability and to lessen the overall environmental impact of fuel, emission and labor cost that repeated organic spraying would require.|$|E
2500|$|The yeast species {{commonly}} known as Saccharomyces cerevisiae was first identified in late 19th century <b>enology</b> text as Saccharomyces ellipsoideus due to the elliptical (as opposed to circular) shape of the cells. Throughout the 20th century, more than 700 different strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were identified. The difference between {{the vast majority of}} these strains are mostly minor, though individual winemakers will develop a preference for particular strains when making certain wines or working with particular grape varieties. Some of these difference include the [...] "vigor" [...] or speed of fermentation, temperature tolerance, the production of volatile sulfur compounds (such as hydrogen sulfide) and other compounds that may influence the aroma of the wine.|$|E
2500|$|In 1852, Luciano Murrieta {{created the}} first fine wine of the Duque de la Victoria area, having learned the process in Bordeaux.
