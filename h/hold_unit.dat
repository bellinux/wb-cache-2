40|$|Certain single input, linearised {{extremum}} controllers of {{the empirical}} type {{described in the}} literature have been designed and their performances have been {{compared to that of}} an approximately optimal controller. The plant is subject to disturbances, lags and measurement noise. A dimensionless performance criterion and description of the plant have been used to present the results. A design procedure for a sinusoidal perturbation controller in connection with the above plant has been obtained, using a linear equivalent circuit for the system together with an experimentally obtained estimate of the equivalent circuit validity. Experimental results have shown that the resulting design is the best, and that the system is likely to remain stable, when the performance of the system is limited mainly by the measurement noise. This empirical controller has been compared with Roberts approximately optimal controller and has been shown to perform equally well if the effect of the lag is small. The performances of three different types of extremum controller have been compared when the plant lags can be neglected. The three controllers use sine wave perturbation, square wave perturbation, and square wave perturbation with a sample and <b>hold</b> <b>unit</b> in the controller. It has been shown that all three the perturbation frequency is infinite. When the perturbation frequency is limited, as in a practical system, the controllers without the sample and <b>hold</b> <b>unit</b> give better performance, at the expense of requiring the adjustment of an additional controller parameter...|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of our audit of financial accountability in the Gateway District (Project Number 09 BD 022 FF 000). This audit was self-initiated and addresses financial risk. The objective of our audit was to determine whether internal controls over stamp, cash, and money order accountabilities; financial differences; employee items; and disbursements at the selected sites were in place and effective. See Appendix A for additional information about this audit. Conclusion We visited five Gateway District post offices and stations with high-risk accounting activities according to our PARIS Cost and Controls model. We identified internal control and compliance issues at these sites related to stamp, cash, and money order accountabilities; financial differences; 1 employee items; and disbursements. In addition, we identified similar issues at five other sites in the Gateway District that we audited during fiscal year (FY) 2009. 2 We attribute these internal control deficiencies to an insufficient district-wide monitoring program that identified high-risk offices but did not <b>hold</b> <b>unit</b> managers accountable for implementing and documenting corrective actions. As a result, Gateway District post offices, stations, and branches are at an increased risk of losing cash, accountable items, and revenue without detection; and misstating financial records. We identified $ 171, 000 in monetary impact and approximately $ 1. 9 million in non-monetary impact as a result of unit managers not effectively implementing internal controls. 1 Financial differences are unreconciled expense entries that must be researched and resolved in a timely manner...|$|E

We undertook a retrospective cohort study of children < 13 years old admitted to 11 Ebola <b>holding</b> <b>units</b> in the Western Area, Sierra Leone, during 2014 - 2015 to identify factors affecting outcome. Primary outcome was death or discharge after transfer to Ebola treatment centers. All 309 Ebola virus-positive children 2 days- 12 years old were included; outcomes were available for 282 (91 %). Case-fatality was 57 %, and 55 % of deaths occurred in Ebola <b>holding</b> <b>units.</b> Blood test results showed hypoglycemia and hepatic/renal dysfunction. Death occurred swiftly (median 3 days after admission) and was associated with younger age and diarrhea. Despite triangulation of information from multiple sources, data availability was limited, and we identified no modifiable factors substantially affecting death. In future Ebola virus disease epidemics, robust, rapid data collection is vital to determine effectiveness of interventions for children. 27649367 PMC 503843...|$|R
