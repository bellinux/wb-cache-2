25|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>gun</b> {{delivery}} ballistically accelerates plasmid DNA (pDNA) {{that has}} been absorbed onto gold or tungsten microparticles into the target cells, using compressed helium as an accelerant.|$|E
25|$|Methods for non-viral {{gene therapy}} include the {{injection}} of naked DNA, electroporation, the <b>gene</b> <b>gun,</b> sonoporation, magnetofection, {{the use of}} oligonucleotides, lipoplexes, dendrimers, and inorganic nanoparticles.|$|E
25|$|The {{delivery}} method determines the dose required to raise an effective immune response. Saline injections require variable amounts of DNA, from 10μg-1mg, whereas <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> deliveries require 100 to 1000 times. Generally, 0.2μg – 20μg are required, although quantities {{as low as}} 16ng have been reported. These quantities vary by species. Mice for example, require approximately 10 times less DNA than primates. Saline injections require more DNA because the DNA is delivered to the extracellular spaces of the target tissue (normally muscle), where it has to overcome physical barriers (such as the basal lamina and large amounts of connective tissue, to mention a few) before it is {{taken up by the}} cells, while <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> deliveries bombard DNA directly into the cells, resulting in less “wastage”.|$|E

2500|$|Genetically {{engineered}} crops have genes added or removed using {{genetic engineering}} techniques, [...] originally including <b>gene</b> <b>guns,</b> electroporation, microinjection and agrobacterium. More recently, CRISPR and TALEN offered much more precise and convenient editing techniques.|$|R
25|$|Besides direct {{transfection}} of dendritic {{cells or}} macrophages, cross priming occurs following IM, ID and <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> DNA deliveries. Cross-priming {{occurs when a}} bone marrow-derived cell presents peptides from proteins synthesised in another cell {{in the context of}} MHC class 1. This can prime cytotoxic T-cell responses and seems to be important for a full primary immune response.|$|E
25|$|Studies using {{chimeric}} mice {{have shown}} that antigen is presented by bone-marrow derived cells, which include dendritic cells, macrophages and specialised B-cells called professional antigen presenting cells (APC). After <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> inoculation to the skin, transfected Langerhans cells migrate to the draining lymph node to present antigens. After IM and ID injections, dendritic cells present antigen in the draining lymph node and transfected macrophages {{have been found in}} the peripheral blood.|$|E
25|$|The type of T-cell help raised is {{influenced}} by the delivery method and the type of immunogen expressed, as well as the targeting of different lymphoid compartments. Generally, saline needle injections (either IM or ID) tend to induce TH1 responses, while <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> delivery raises TH2 responses. This is true for intracellular and plasma membrane-bound antigens, but not for secreted antigens, which seem to generate TH2 responses, regardless of the method of delivery.|$|E
40|$|The use of <b>gene</b> <b>guns</b> in ballistically {{delivering}} DNA vaccine coated gold micro-particles to skin {{can potentially}} damage targeted cells, therefore influencing transfection efficiencies. In this paper, we assess cell {{death in the}} viable epidermis by non-invasive near infrared two-photon microscopy following micro-particle bombardment of murine skin. We show that the ballistic delivery of micro-particles to the viable epidermis can result in localised cell death. Furthermore, experimental results show the degree of cell death is dependant {{on the number of}} micro-particles delivered per unit of tissue surface area. Micro-particles densities of 0. 16 +/- 0. 27 (mean +/- S. D.), 1. 35 +/- 0. 285 and 2. 72 +/- 0. 47 per 1000 mu m(2) resulted in percent deaths of 3. 96 +/- 5. 22, 45. 91 +/- 10. 89, 90. 52 +/- 12. 28, respectively. These results suggest that optimization of transfection by genes administered with <b>gene</b> <b>guns</b> is - among other effects - a compromise of micro-particle payload and cell death.

2500|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>guns</b> (also {{known as}} biolistics) [...] "shoot" [...] (direct high energy {{particles}} or radiations against) target genes into plant cells. It {{is the most}} common method. DNA is bound to tiny particles of gold or tungsten which are subsequently shot into plant tissue or single plant cells under high pressure. The accelerated particles penetrate both the cell wall and membranes. The DNA separates from the metal and is integrated into plant DNA inside the nucleus. This method has been applied successfully for many cultivated crops, especially monocots like wheat or maize, for which transformation using Agrobacterium tumefaciens has been less successful. The major disadvantage of this procedure is that serious damage can be done to the cellular tissue.|$|R
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the serial Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences [© Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] set of well-defined experiments has been carried out to explore whether microneedles (MNs) can enhance the penetration depths of microparticles moving at high velocity such as those expected in <b>gene</b> <b>guns</b> for delivery of gene-loaded microparticles into target tissues. These experiments are based on applying solid MNs that are used to reduce the effect of mechanical barrier function of the target so as to allow delivery of microparticles at less imposed pressure as compared with most typical <b>gene</b> <b>guns.</b> Further, a low-cost material, namely, biomedical-grade stainless steel microparticle with size ranging between 1 and 20 μm, has been used in this study. The microparticles are compressed and bound {{in the form of a}} cylindrical pellet and mounted on a ground slide, which are then accelerated together by compressed air through a barrel. When the ground slide reaches the end of the barrel, the pellet is separated from the ground slide and is broken down into particle form by a mesh that is placed at the end of the barrel. Subsequently, these particles penetrate into the target. This paper investigates the implications of velocity of the pellet along with various other important factors that affect the particle delivery into the target. Our results suggest that the particle passage increases with an increase in pressure, mesh pore size, and decreases with increase in polyvinylpyrrolidone concentration. Most importantly, it is shown that MNs increase the penetration depths of the particles...|$|R
25|$|Humoral {{responses}} after {{a single}} DNA injection {{can be much}} longer-lived than after a single injection with a recombinant protein. Antibody responses against hepatitis B virus (HBV) envelope protein (HBsAg) have been sustained for up to 74 weeks without boost, while lifelong maintenance of protective response to influenza haemagglutinin was demonstrated in mice after <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> delivery. Antibody-secreting cells migrate to the bone marrow and spleen for long-term antibody production, and generally localise there after one year.|$|E
25|$|The {{two most}} popular {{approaches}} are injection of DNA in saline, using a standard hypodermic needle and <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> delivery. Injection in saline is normally conducted intramuscularly (IM) in skeletal muscle, or intradermally (ID), delivering DNA to extracellular spaces. This can be assisted by electroporation; by temporarily damaging muscle fibres with myotoxins such as bupivacaine; or by using hypertonic solutions of saline or sucrose. Immune responses to this method can be affected by factors including needle type, needle alignment, speed of injection, volume of injection, muscle type, and age, sex and physiological condition of the recipient.|$|E
25|$|Two {{theories}} dominate – that in vivo uptake of DNA occurs non-specifically, in {{a method}} similar to phago- or pinocytosis, or through specific receptors. These might include a 30kDa surface receptor, or macrophage scavenger receptors. The 30kDa surface receptor binds specifically to 4500-bp DNA fragments (which are then internalised) and is found on professional APCs and T-cells. Macrophage scavenger receptors bind {{to a variety}} of macromolecules, including polyribonucleotides and are thus candidates for DNA uptake. Receptor-mediated DNA uptake could be facilitated by the presence of polyguanylate sequences. <b>Gene</b> <b>gun</b> delivery systems, cationic liposome packaging, and other delivery methods bypass this entry method, but understanding it may be useful in reducing costs (e.g. by reducing the requirement for cytofectins), which could be important in animal husbandry.|$|E
50|$|Back in town, Frog waits anxiously for Gene's arrival so {{the show}} can begin. One of Parker's henchmen tells Frog about Gene being captured. Frog {{is forced to}} start the show using a double for Gene. Believing that Gene has escaped, Parker orders his {{right-hand}} man, Jeff Galloway (Jack Dougherty), to kill him, and Galloway shoots the double. Meanwhile, Gene, who has escaped his captors, arrives back in town and learns about the crime. He tells Sheriff Martin (Henry Hall) {{to meet him at}} Arthur's ranch. When he arrives, Gene discovers that his father is dead, and rushing over to the Baynum cabin, Gene finds Milly's stepfather Bayliss has also been murdered. Because Bayliss was bludgeoned with <b>Gene's</b> <b>gun,</b> which Parker's men had stolen, Sheriff Martin arrests Gene for the murder and takes him to jail.|$|R
40|$|By {{means of}} a {{transonic}} gas jet, <b>gene</b> <b>guns</b> ballistically deliver microparticle formulations of drugs and vaccines to the outer layers of the skin or mucosal tissue to induce unique physiological responses {{for the treatment of}} a range of conditions. Reported high-speed imaging experiments show that the mucosa deforms significantly while subjected to an impinging gas jet from a biolistic device. In this paper, the effect of this tissue surface deformation on microparticle impact conditions is simulated with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations. The microparticles are idealized as spheres of diameters 26. 1, 39 and 99 mu m and a density of 1050 kg m(- 3). Deforming surface calculations of particle impact conditions are compared directly with an immobile surface case. The relative velocity and obliquity of the deforming surface decrease the normal component of particle impact velocity by up to 30 % at {{the outer edge of the}} impinging gas jet. This is qualitatively consistent with reported particle penetration profiles in the tissue. It is recommended that these effects be considered in biolistic studies requiring quantified particle impact conditions...|$|R
30|$|Gene {{therapy is}} {{recognized}} as a medical approach {{for the treatment of}} diseases that are difficult to cure, such as tumors. Several viral and non-viral carriers for gene transfer have been developed for either in vivo or ex vivo/in vitro use [1 – 4]. The most important viral carriers, characterized in laboratory studies and clinical trials, have been inactivated retroviruses, adenoviruses, adeno-associated viruses, and herpes viruses. These viruses show relatively high transfection efficiency, but have some clinical safety problems. On the other hand, non-viral methods of gene delivery, including cationic lipofection, calcium phosphate precipitation, <b>gene</b> <b>guns,</b> and injection of naked DNA, generally show low transfection efficiency but are not pathogenic [1 – 4]. However, there is another serious issue regarding the present gene delivery methodologies. Almost all the gene delivery methods currently developed have insufficient ability to specifically recognize and target diseased cells and to distinguish them from normal cells, especially in the same tissue or organ. Thus a number of strategies that address the issue of target-selective gene delivery have been reported. These systems generally involve the use of various ligands that selectively bind to a cell-surface marker on the target cell [5, 6].|$|R
25|$|How these {{different}} methods operate, {{the forms of}} antigen expressed, and the different profiles of T-cell help is not understood. It was thought that the relatively large amounts of DNA used in IM injection {{were responsible for the}} induction of TH1 responses. However, evidence shows no dose-related differences in TH type. The type of T-cell help raised is determined by the differentiated state of antigen presenting cells. Dendritic cells can differentiate to secrete IL-12 (which supports TH1 cell development) or IL-4 (which supports TH2 responses). pDNA injected by needle is endocytosed into the dendritic cell, which is then stimulated to differentiate for TH1 cytokine production, while the <b>gene</b> <b>gun</b> bombards the DNA directly into the cell, thus bypassing TH1 stimulation.|$|E
25|$|Transformation using {{electroporation}} {{was developed}} in the late 1980s, increasing the efficiency of in-vitro transformation and increasing the number of bacterial strains that could be transformed. Transformation of animal and plant cells was also investigated with the first transgenic mouse being created by injecting a gene for a rat growth hormone into a mouse embryo in 1982. In 1907 a bacterium that caused plant tumors, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, was discovered and in the early 1970s the tumor-inducing agent was found to be a DNA plasmid called the Ti plasmid. By removing the genes in the plasmid that caused the tumor and adding in novel genes, researchers were able to infect plants with A. tumefaciens and let the bacteria insert their chosen DNA into the genomes of the plants. Not all plant cells are susceptible to infection by A. tumefaciens, so other methods were developed, including electroporation and micro-injection. Particle bombardment was made possible with the invention of the Biolistic Particle Delivery System (<b>gene</b> <b>gun)</b> by John Sanford in the 1980s.|$|E

40|$|A {{simple and}} {{efficient}} method to transform Physcomitrella pantens protoplasts is described. This method {{is adapted from}} protocols for Physocmitrella protonemal protoplast and Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplast transformation 1. Due to its capacity to undergo efficient mitotic homologous recombination, Physcomitrella patens has emerged as an important model system in recent years 2. This capacity allows high frequencies of gene targeting 3 - 9, which is not seen in other model plants such as Arabidopsis. To {{take full advantage of}} this system, we need an effective and easy method to deliver DNA into moss cells. The most common ways to transform this moss are particle bombardment 10 and PEG-mediated DNA uptake 11. Although particle bombardment can produce a high transformation efficiency 12, <b>gene</b> <b>guns</b> are not readily available to many laboratories and the protocol is difficult to standardize. On the other hand, PEG mediated transformation does not require specialized equipments, and can be performed in any laboratory with a sterile hood. Here, we show a simple and highly efficient method for transformation of moss protoplasts. This method can generate more than 120 transient transformants per microgram of DNA, which is an improvement from the most efficient protocol previously reported 13. Because of its simplicity, efficiency, and reproducibility, this method can be applied to projects requiring large number of transformants as well as for routine transformation...|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} custom manufactured <b>gene</b> <b>guns</b> (fabricated by Nelson Allen) used a 22 caliber {{nail gun}} cartridge to propel an extruded polyethylene cylinder (bullet) down a 22 cal. Douglas barrel. A droplet of the tungsten powder and genetic material {{was placed on}} the bullet and shot down the barrel at a lexan [...] "stopping" [...] disk with a petri dish below. The bullet welded to the disk and the genetic material blasted into the sample in the dish with a doughnut effect (devastation in the middle, a ring of good transformation and little around the edge). The gun was connected to a vacuum pump and was under vacuum while firing. The early design was put into limited production by a Rumsey-Loomis (a local machine shop then at Mecklenburg Rd in Ithaca, NY, USA). Later the design was refined by removing the [...] "surge tank" [...] and changing to nonexplosive propellants. DuPont added a plastic extrusion to the exterior to visually improve the machine for mass production to the scientific community. Biorad contracted with Dupont to manufacture and distribute the device. Improvements include the use of helium propellant and a multi-disk-collision delivery mechanism. Other heavy metals such as gold and silver are also used. Gold may be favored because it has better uniformity than tungsten and tungsten can be toxic to cells, but its use may be limited due to availability and cost.|$|R
40|$|Chloroplast {{development}} {{is an important}} determinant of plant productivity and is controlled by environmental factors including amounts of light and nitrogen as well as internal phytohormones including cytokinins and gibberellins (GA). The paralog GATA transcription factors GNC and CGA 1 /GNL up-regulated by light, nitrogen and cytokinin while also being repressed by GA signaling. Modifying the expression of these genes has previously been shown to influence chlorophyll content in Arabidopsis while also altering aspects of germination, elongation growth and flowering time. In this work, we also use transgenic lines to demonstrate that GNC and CGA 1 exhibit a partially redundant control over chlorophyll biosynthesis. We provide novel evidence that GNC and CGA 1 influence both chloroplast number and leaf starch in proportion to their transcript level. GNC and CGA 1 were found to modify the expression of chloroplast localized GLUTAMATE SYNTHASE (GLU 1 /Fd-GOGAT), which is the primary factor controlling nitrogen assimilation in green tissue. Altering GNC and CGA 1 expression was also found to modulate the expression of important chlorophyll biosynthesis <b>genes</b> (<b>GUN</b> 4, HEMA 1, PORB, and PORC). As previously demonstrated, the CGA 1 transgenic plants demonstrated significantly altered timing {{to a number of}} developmental events including germination, leaf production, flowering time and senescence. In contrast, the GNC transgenic lines we analyzed maintain relatively normal growth phenotypes outside of differences in chloroplast development. Despite some evidence for partial divergence, results indicate that regulation of both GNC and CGA 1 by light, nitrogen, cytokinin, and GA acts to modulate nitrogen assimilation, chloroplast development and starch production. Understanding the mechanisms controlling these processes is important for agricultural biotechnology...|$|R

In this way, Salaway's fiction may reflect the same zeitgeist that produced many of the most cerebral television scripts of the late 1950s and early 1960s such as those of Rod Serling (The Twilight Zone, etc.) and <b>Gene</b> Roddenberry (Have <b>Gun,</b> Will Travel, etc.).|$|R
