40|$|Abstract Poly (lactic acid) (PLA) is an {{aliphatic}} polyester and ecofriendly {{material of}} a natural origin with biodegradable properties. The monomer for PLA is lactic acid obtained from the fermentation of sugar and vegetables like corn and cassava. This study investigated the effect of <b>heatsetting</b> and wet processes on the tensile properties of treated and untreated Ingeo ™ Poly (Lactic acid) PLA knitted fabrics. PLA samples of dimension 200 mm x 200 mm were subjected to <b>heatsetting</b> at a temperature of 130 oC and increasing times of 15 s, 30 s, 45 s, 60 s, 90 s, 120 s and 240 s respectively using the Werner Mathis infra-red <b>heatsetting</b> equipment and subsequently treated to wet processes including scouring, alkaline reduction clearing, dyeing and softening. Four tensile parameters were determined in warp and weft direction using the KES-FB system of fabric evaluation. These tensile parameters were tensile extension EM [%], linearity of load extension LT [-], tensile energy WT [g. cm/cm 2] and tensile resilience RT [%]. The results showed (i) a consistent increase in tensile extension of treated PLA (unlike untreated PLA knitted fabric) with increasing time of <b>heatsetting</b> and wet finishing applications suggesting that treated PLA may tend to exhibit enhanced fabric hand or softness and increased formability (ii) Treated PLA to exhibit lower LT with increasing time of <b>heatsetting</b> and wet treatments implying a better formability and in-plane compressibility of treated PLA when compared to untreated PLA (iii) Treated PLA to display a greater tensile energy than untreated PLA, implying that treated PLA has greater flexibility, softness, gentleness and smoothness than the untreated PL...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Enzymatic hydrolysis of fish waste has been examined using proteolytic enzymes under different conditions of pH, enzyme to substrate ratio, and substrate concentration. Proteolytic enzymes have then been used to synthesise a protein-like product (plastein). The particular enzymes used in both parts {{of this study were}} bromelein, a-chymotrypsin, pepsin and papain. Reasonable yield was obtained. The yield of plastein was found as a function of substrate concentration. enzyme to substrate ratio, degree of hydrolysis and enzyme used. Generally, the plastein appeared to be odourless, yellowish to creamy in colour. tasteless and rich nutritionally. The insoluble plastein formed was washed, dried and then tested for its functional properties, particularly with respect to water absorption capacity, swelling capacity, oil absorption capacity. foam and foam stability, emulsion stability, gelatination, viscosity, and heat-setting properties. The functional properties of the plastein precursor (fw*hydrolysate) and of commercial proteins have also been examined. The dried plastein which was tested under different conditions was found not only to possess functional properties such as fat/water absorption, swelling and emulsion stability. but also excellent foaming properties were observed. Although plastein appeared to be gel-like before drying, it was, however. not able to retain its gelatinity after drying. Therefore, {{it would be possible to}} use it in a food system as an alternative to the material substituted without changing the texture (e. g. in cereal products). The viscosity of the plastein was varied under the conditions used. It was found to be mainly a function of the temperature and the concentration.

40|$|In the {{manufacture}} of polyester fiber, first takes place the synthesis of the polymer, and subsequently the spinning and stretching of the fibre. The conditions to which these processes occur, such as temperature, drawing speed or time, have great influence on the fine structure of the resulting fiber (crystallinity and orientation). If variations of these conditions occur, voluntary or not, it may produce differences in {{the properties of the}} fiber. This is because the fine structure of the resulting fiber can present irregularities, ie differences in crystallinity and / or orientation. It is important to detect these irregularities in the structure as soon as possible, because the properties affected may be different: since an irregular deformation of the material until an irregular dyeing. To achieve the final textile product, it is necessary to carry out different processes. In each of these processes (warping, weaving, bleaching, dyeing, finishing, [...] .), energy, water and chemicals consumption, occur, whith the corresponding cost. The earlier the detection of irregularities involuntary, the lower the economic losses of the company. Differential solubility is a physicochemical technique that can reflect differences in the fine structure of the fiber. It informs about the compactness of the fiber. This is a relatively simple test that does not require high cost equipment, or complicated operation. Then, it is possible to use this technique in any laboratory quality control of a textile company. It can also be used when the fiber is still present as staple fibre. In the differential solubility test, the fiber contacts with a solvent/non-solvent mixture, under certain conditions of temperature and time, and the percentage of dissolved fiber is determined. The more crystalline and/or oriented fiber has the lower differential solubility. Traditionally in this test a mixture of phenol/tetrachloroethane (Ph/TCE), from 2. 5 / 97. 5 in weight for heat-treated fibers, and up to 30 / 70 samples at high <b>heatseting</b> temperatures has been used. The European Union, with the intention of protecting the population and the environment, establishes a list of substances and preparations to which applies certain restrictions to the commercialisation and use. The tetrachloroethane is included, and although these restrictions do not apply in research activities, this has led supply problems and a considerable increase in price. This thesis is a study of the differential solubility of polyester using non-chlorinated solvent/non-solvent mixtures, particularly phenol/water (Ph/H 2 O) {{as an alternative to the}} phenol/tetrachloroethane (Ph/TCE) mixture. If the results are satisfactory, it will be possible to use this technique so useful for the textile industry, with a solvent/non-chlorinated solvent mixture. The technique is optimized and applied to three different groups of polyester fibers. In each of these groups, the fibers exhibit differences in their fine structure. Results have been compared with the differential solubilty in Ph/H 2 O mixtures with the values obtained for these same samples with other test to determine the technical feasibility of this test. It concludes that the use of a unchlorinated phenol/water (Ph/H 2 O) mixture in the physico-chemical test of differential solubility is appropriate for determining the fine structure differences in the 3 groups of substrates studied and that the method is acceptable in terms of reproducibility. However, it is necessary to adjust the concentration and temperature Ph/H 2 O test for each group of substrates to be compared. En la fabricació de fibra de polièster primer té lloc la síntesi de les molècules que formaran el polímer, després la seva polimerització, i posteriorment la filatura i l'estiratge.

50|$|By {{the late}} 1920s new {{colorants}} {{had been developed}} that were very enticing to the printing industry. Though they were best used as dyes {{to show off their}} brightness, this proved to be problematic. Where traditional pigment based inks would lie on a paper's surface, these thinner watery dyes had a tendency to be absorbed into a paper's fibers, where it lost its advantage of higher color density, leaving behind a dull blurry finish. To experience the rich colors of dyes light must be able to pass through them to excite their electrons. A partial solution was to combine these dyes with petroleum distillates, leading to faster drying <b>heatset</b> inks. But it was Curt Teich who finally solved the problem by embossing paper with a linen texture before printing. The embossing created more surface area, which allowed the new <b>heatset</b> inks to dry even faster. The quicker drying time allowed these dyes to remain on the paper's surface, thus retaining their superior strength, which give Linens their telltale bright colors. In addition to printing with the usual CYMK colors, a lighter blue was sometimes used to give the images extra punch. Higher speed presses could also accommodate this method, leading to its widespread use. Although first introduced in 1931, their growing popularity was interrupted by the outbreak of war. They were not to be printed in numbers again until the later 1940s, when the war effort ceased consuming most of the country’s resources. Even though the images on linen cards were based on photographs, they contained much handwork of the artists who brought them into production. There is of course nothing new in this; what it notable is that they were to be the last postcards to show any touch of the human hand on them. In their last days, many were published to look more like photo-based chrome cards that began to dominate the market. Textured papers for postcards had been manufactured ever {{since the turn of the}} century. But since this procedure was not then a necessary step in aiding card production, its added cost kept the process limited to a handful of publishers. Its original use most likely came from attempts to simulate the texture of canvas, thus relating the postcard to a painted work of fine art.|$|E

40|$|Paper that is {{subjected}} to moisture undergoes dimensional changes. It expands during moistening and shrinks during drying. When the paper is under tension between rollers, the effects are complex since shrinkage and expansion are restricted in the width direction. Waves can then appear on the paper web. This {{can be a problem}} in <b>heatset</b> web offset printing. The problem is known as waviness or fluting. The printed papers exhibit a wavy shape, which is visually disturbing due to light reflections which create glossy streaks. The aim of the work described in this thesis was to develop a method suitable for studying the moisture- and tension-induced waviness. Experiments were carried out on a laboratory scale to study how such waves develop during moistening and drying. The experimental setup was based on a modified tensile tester. A CCD camera and image analysis based on the STFI-OptiTopo technique was used to characterise the waviness. Moistening and drying were achieved by changing the surrounding air humidity. The method was used to study the effect of moisture uptake by the paper, and to evaluate the effect of tension on the waviness. It was found that increasing moisture resulted in a higher waviness amplitude, but that the web tension controlled the wavelength of the waviness. A high tension gave rise to a shorter wavelength. The measured wavelength was compared with a previously suggested model and the predicted wavelength was about twice as high as the measured wavelength. When paper becomes damp it can develop waves which can be a problem with <b>heatset</b> web offset printing. Paper with waves may have glossy streaks after printing. Laboratory experiments studied the effect of moisture uptake by the paper. Readings were taken at a range of air humidities. The effect of tension on the waviness was also measured.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the Walker and Fetsko ink {{transfer}} equation {{was used as}} an analytic tool to determine how the physical properties of the transfer surface change from printing on unprinted paper to overprinting on another wet ink film. The equation has three parameters, b, k, and f, which indicate {{what is happening in the}} nip of the press during the moment of impression. Parameter b represents the maximum absorptive capacity of the paper, parameter k is highly reflective of printing smoothness, and parameter f represents the fraction of free ink film which splits to the paper surface. The I. G. T. Printability Tester was used to simulate the wet-on-wet trapping which occurs on a lithographic press. <b>Heatset</b> inks and uncoated paper were used to conduct the testing. Application of the equation to the experimental data showed that the surface in wet-on-wet trapping is less absorbent, smoother, and increases the fraction of free ink film which splits to the paper in comparison to the surface of the unprinted paper. The first two observations are explained simply by considering that in wet-on-wet trapping the paper porosity and the low spots on the paper surface are filled by the first-down ink film. The third observation regarding parameter f is explained by considering a model in which the ink film cavities expand and the ink film ruptures more readily in areas of high vehicle concentration and low viscosity. In printing to the unprinted paper the vehicle drains more quickly into the paper than the pigment particles due to its lower viscosity and lower molecular weight. Thus there is a higher concentration of vehicle nearer the paper surface, causing the split to occur here. On the other hand, the surface in wet-on-wet trapping at the moment the second ink film is transferred is not very absorbent. Therefore, the vehicle does not drain that quickly into the surface, causing the viscosity of the ink film to be the same throughout, which tends to create a fifty percent split...|$|E
40|$|This work {{examines}} the thermal transfer through porous media {{by means of}} measurement of the effective thermal conductivity and modelling of the structural parameters. While {{most of the work}} is of a general nature, the porous media in focus are pigment plus latex binder systems as used for paper coatings. As such, the application field of thermal effects in printing is discussed. At first the use of a dynamic measurement method for the thermal conductivity of porous coating pigment binder systems in the form of tablets is evaluated. In addition, a Lumped Parameter Model is developed to analyse the measured thermal conductivities in terms of the material volume fractions and their structural configuration. The model therefore uses two independent structural parameters instead of porosity alone as the governing parameter. This enables a discussion following modelling approaches adopting parameter modelling and structural modelling. A combination of both is used to discuss the solid-solid connectivity of pigment binder systems. It is shown by the model parameter of pigment connectivity that a disruption of the pigment packing already at low concentrations of binder occurs related to surface and colloid chemistry factors which cause the binder to accumulate first at pigment nodal points. The analysis of different pigment binder systems shows that, due to the presence of two interacting solid phases, the effective thermal conductivity cannot be modelled by using porosity and pore structure alone, but also requires the additional parameter of dual solid phase connectivity. It is proposed, therefore, that a combination of pore structure analysis and thermal conductivity measurement can be used to identify and parameterise subtleties in interactive particulate systems. For the application of toner fusing in electrophotography it is shown that a thermally insulating coating layer leads to a concentration of the fusing energy on the surface, thus aiding the fusing/adhesion development of the toner while shielding the base paper from undesired heating. In the <b>heatset</b> web-offset drying process, an insulating precoating in combination with liquid barrier properties can lead to a similar shielding of the base paper and thus helps to maintain an even moisture profile effectively reducing the waving/fluting tendency...|$|E
40|$|With {{the advent}} of desktop color {{scanners}} in the electronic prepress production environment, quality in color separations from transmissive originals has become erratic. The cause of this fluctuation is, in part, due to the transition from PMT to CCD-based scanning technology. Whereas, PMT scanners {{tend to have a}} broad dynamic range, that of CCD scanners is more limited. This characteristic adversely affects the quality of color separations by causing additional tone compression. An original transparency typically has a shadow density of 3. 00 and a diffused highlight density of 0. 30 for an overall density range of 2. 70. On a four-color <b>heatset</b> web press with coated stock, the maximum reproducible tonal range corresponds to a density of 1. 80. The difference in density of 0. 90 between the original and the press sheet is unable to fit through the printing window unless it undergoes considerable tone compression. This project was based on two hypotheses. The first was that the lower the tonal range of a transmissive original the more readily lower-midtone-to-shadow tonality could be retained in the separations produced by a CCD scanner and related equipment. The second was that exposure latitude in the separations would decrease with increasing tonal range. The first stage of production was to produce twelve test transparencies by photograph ing a still life set to four tonal ranges: 3. 5, 4. 5, 5. 5, and 6. 5 f/stops. Within each range, three images were selected to represent normal exposure, 1 / 2 f/stop overexposure, and 1 / 2 f/stop underexposure. Comparison of halftone proofs, made from separations of the normallyexposed transparencies, were later used for the first hypothesis. Proofs from the 1 / 2 f/stop over- and 1 / 2 f/stop underexposures were compared with the normal exposures to test the second hypothesis. vm The twelve test transparencies were first scanned on the Dainippon Screen SG- 608 to produce a set of best-of-kind reference separations and halftone proofs. Next, the trans parencies were scanned on two midrange 12 -bit CCD scanners, one a Pixelcraft CIS 4520 RS, the other an Agfa Horizon. Separations for both were produced with Color Access 1. 3. 3 software on a Macintosh Quadra 700 computer, linked to an Agfa SelectSet 5000 image-setter via an Agfa 5000 PS Star Plus RIP. The image files were placed in an 8 1 / 22 ̆ 2 X 112 ̆ 2 QuarkXPress page with a 20...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Wheat (Triticum aestivum) {{is one of}} the world’s major {{staple food}} crops, with flour {{produced}} from starchy endosperm being used for breads, cakes, noodles and various other wheat-based foods. The unique bread making properties of wheat are primarily attributed to its gluten-forming storage proteins: gliadins and glutenins. This study investigated the gluten proteins from functional and historical perspectives. The first study examined primarily the functional role of gluten proteins in the outcomes of the standard Falling Number (FN) test. The FN test is used in the grain trade to screen delivered wheat for the presence of pre-harvest sprouting by indirectly measuring α-amylase through it effects on the physical consistency of a cooked flour-water suspension. Grain protein content (GPC) has been implicated as a potential modifier of FN independent of α-amylase or sprout status. In the gluten functionality study, we proposed a protein unfolding and crosslinking model, and hypothesized that gluten proteins with higher molecular weight distributions (MWD) would <b>heatset</b> faster, tightly cover starch granules, restrict water entry, and slow their disintegration. In contrast to our hypothesis, our results showed that samples with lower MWD had faster <b>heatset</b> times than samples with higher MWD according to a controlled heating test. We also hypothesize that increased granularity of hard wheat flour reduces the surface area to volume ratio so the starch granules embedded in the particles need more time to hydrate or swell. However, our results indicated that natural variations in flour particle size from a standard grinding procedure that used a 0. 8 mm screen had no impact on FN. The second study looked at potential changes in gluten proteins in a historical set of wheat varieties spanning more than 110 years of production. The wheats were in two sets: soft wheats where there has been no systematic selection for increased dough strength in breeding programs, and hard wheats where there has been a concerted effort to increase overall dough strength over the last century. The sample sets also covered the eras before and after the introduction of the semi-dwarf wheats to the USA. The reason for this investigation is related to the circumstance that wheat is the cause of celiac disease (CD) and is implcated in the disputed condition, non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS). Recently, diagnoses of CD at least have increased and there are suggestions that changes in gluten proteins in the modern era are responsible. Since it is primarily gliadins that trigger CD, it was considered worth investigating whether or not there have been any changes in the composition of gliadins over the last century. Sixty-two soft and 61 hard U. S. high production wheat varieties from 1900 to the present (with one from 1800) were collected and analyzed by RP-HPLC. These varieties were investigated to begin to answer whether wheat breeding for higher dough strength, or the incorporation of dwarfing alleles after the 1960 s, was associated with observable changes in gliadin composition. ANOVA showed that {{there was no significant difference}} between soft and hard wheats in the relative abundance of α/β-gliadins. However, there were significant differences between hard and soft wheats in the relative abundance of ω- and γ-gliadins. ANOVA also showed that there was no significant difference between tall and dwarf wheats in the relative abundance of any of the three gliadin fractions. The ANOVA results suggested that deliberate breeding for dough strength, as illustrated by the hard versus soft wheat contrast, had not systematically changed the relative abundance of α/β-gliadins across the last 110 years, but had altered the relative abundance of the other two fractions. ANOVA results indicated no change in proportions of the three gliadin fractions after deployment of the dwarfing alleles suggesting the tall to dwarf change was independent of gluten composition. Second order polynomial regression analyses showed that the relative abundance of α/β-gliadins increased until around 1960 then decreased. The changes were more noticeable in the hard wheats. The converse was observed for 1 ̆d 6 fe-gliadins. This stepwise change questioned the association between CD increase and breeding for increased dough strength in hard wheats, since the relative abundance of α/β-gliadins did not keep going up, and α-gliadin is considered the major trigger force for CD initiation. In contrast, linear correlation analyses with each of 700, three second long fractions of the RP-HPLC chromatograms suggested that most changes were related to the soft wheat population. The discrepancy between the regression analyses of the three major fractions and the 700 small fractions may be related to the use of linear correlations in the latter when some relationships were clearly non-linear. Overall, our results did not fully support speculations that there have been profound changes in gluten composition related to the dwarfing alleles or selection for increased dough strength in hard wheats...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this thesis}} is to develop and test industry-specific, applied work {{procedures}} and tools for environmental and emerging sustainability work in the graphic arts industry. This includes methods to quantify, follow-up, evaluate, manage, improve and communicate the environmental performance of activities in the graphic arts supply chain and printed products. In order to achieve {{the aims of the}} thesis, a selection of work areas were chosen as the basis for developing the industry-specific work procedures and tools. The selected work areas are the following: environmental management (being a part of sustainability management), environmental and sustainability strategies, environmental indicators and design for environment (DfE). The research presented in this thesis was based on survey research methods, case studies and multi-company studies. Within the framework of these methods, quantitative and qualitative techniques for data gathering were used. The companies included in the studies were selected according to their willingness, interest and motivation to participate and develop their environmental or sustainability work. The most significant results of the research presented in this thesis regarding the selected work areas are the following: • An evaluation of early certified environmental management systems (EMSs) in Sweden identified four areas as priorities in making the EMSs more efficient. Two of them, viz. improvement in the follow-up of environmental work, and the linking of EMSs to product design, were developed for the graphic arts industry. The remaining two areas were clarifying the identification process and assessment of environmental aspects, and streamlining and co-ordinating different management systems. • An established and successfully tested working method for formulating and realising corporate sustainability strategies in the graphic arts industry. • Industry-specific environmental indicator models for the graphic arts industry with defined methods for standardised inventorying and calculations. These models have been tested, used and approved of by the industry itself. • Collected and compiled data for the developed environmental indicator models. Data have been collected from quite a large number of companies (10 - 20 companies for each of the printing techniques covered, i. e. coldset offset, <b>heatset</b> offset and gravure) {{over a period of several}} years. • The use of the industry-specific environmental indicator models was developed and illustrated. • A described and recommended work procedure for DfE in graphic arts companies including industry-specific tools for applying DfE to printed products, in the form of a manual and a checklist. The checklist was designed so that it can serve as a simple tool for the environmental assessment of printed products. The tools were tested by graphic arts companies. QC 20110124 </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{target of}} this study was to {{identify}} the most important variables affecting the internal product integrity in the case of coated grades for coldset web offset printing. Internal product integrity was experimentally identified to mean in this work printing runnability and visual print quality. Printing runnability was experimentally defined to mean build-up formation tendency on the surface of the common impression cylinder (CIC) at satellite type coldset printing machines. Visual print quality was defined to mean set-off, print-through, contrast, dot-gain, evenness of printed surface and reproducibility of colors. The objectives {{of this study}} had significant commercial value and therefore the entire experimental part was carried out on industrial scale. This experimental set-up was aiming to speed-up the application of potential findings to industrial scale and to facilitate the exploitation of the results since the time consuming and risky step of scaling the laboratory results to industrial scale could be skipped over. The experimental part of this work consists of four parts: Pilot coating of industrial base papers, printing tests in commercial coldset printing process, comparison of print quality potential of different printing methods (coldset, waterless coldset and <b>heatset)</b> and laboratory analyses of base paper, unprinted and printed coldset samples. Laboratory analyses included structural tests, absorption tests, various microscopic methods, permeability tests, confocal Raman analyses and various printability tests. The results of the print quality testing showed that matt LWC printed in coldset reaches such a qualitative level that it allows the printer to exceed the technical obstacles by which the new business models are often confronted. It was further identified that coating pigments and base paper properties have influence on internal product integrity of matt LWC paper in coldset printing. The influence of coating pigments as a single variable in the fine tuning of the internal product integrity was smaller than expected. The influence of coating pigments on the internal product integrity is most likely depending on the base paper properties. A natural area for future studies would be to identify the most important paper technological variables influencing the internal product integrity via base paper properties. Latex properties as single variables did not have clear influence on internal product integrity. Latex coverage had some influence to the internal product integrity. Therefore, experimental designs profiting latex properties as multivariable parameters could bring new knowledge to the fine tuning of the internal product integrity. Printing paper manufacturers should shift the technical testing of product prototypes to industrial scale from laboratory scale. Creation of a new product in printing paper industry should approach the standard concurrent engineering processes, where new product is widely tested in industrial scale after the innovation phase, but before market launch. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|During {{the past}} five to ten years, the {{evolution}} of different media, and especially Internet-related services, has had {{a direct impact on}} the printed newspaper. Companies that have remained stable for several years are today exploring and employing new mechanisms to increase efficiency while maintaining their audiences. Although web offset has been for long the basic production process for printing newspapers, the latest developments implemented in equipment and software for newspaper production have achieved a high degree of automation in prepress, press, and post-press. At the same time, the demand of younger audiences for increasingly diverse and personalized products—as well as the emergence of new services, such as the production of commercial printing jobs—has transformed the newspaper production model (Christensen, 2006). Small newspapers, as well as medium and large, are challenged to compete in this new environment. They have to plan for the future in accordance with their opportunities and limitations. The main purpose of this research was to define a descriptive profile and to represent a graphical workflow model for small newspaper production. Information on the degree of automation, equipment employed, {{and the extent to which}} production has adopted the hybrid model (semi-commercial production) are also included in this descriptive profile. The study consisted of seven newspapers with an average daily circulation between 12, 000 and 50, 000 copies. Six of the participants are located in the U. S., and one is located in Latin America. The main source of information was a survey consisting of demographic, circulation, audience, and production workflow questions. Additionally, the researcher conducted personal interviews and field tours at three of these newspapers. The key findings were: • For the majority of the respondents, the newspaper is between 21 % and 38 % of the total production (measured in total number of copies printed, including TMCs and commercial jobs). • Six of the seven participants have experienced a reduction in circulation during the past few years. In addition to this trend, the age of the core audience has increased, with the average between 50 to 64 years of age for most newspapers. • All of the respondents currently use coldset web offset as the production process. Two companies have plans to expand their facilities by acquiring equipment with <b>heatset</b> dryers and automatic functions. • In general, the respondents do not use a wide variety of finishing processes. The only post-press process used by all newspapers is inserting. In three cases, this is the only post-press process used. • The degree of automation found in the participants’ workflows is relatively low compared to the capabilities offered by printing equipment manufacturers. The stage of production that shows the highest level of automation is prepress. xi • The process that is most frequently a bottleneck is finishing. None of the respondents consider plate production or the press run to be bottlenecks in the workflow. • The majority of the participants responded that they have not implemented a process to ensure quality. It was also found that little information is collected within the respondents’ production processes. • The physical changes considered by the participants are mostly related to contraction of the core product. • All of the surveyed newspapers produce at least one kind of commercial job. The production of other newspapers and inserts are the two most common commercial jobs produced. The majority of the respondents only offer limited types of commercial jobs. • Although the two preferred strategies among the respondents are separating printing from publishing and consolidating printing facilities, there is no clear trend towards any specific strategy. Three of the newspapers stated that they have no specific business strategy for the near future...|$|E
40|$|In many {{industrial}} applications, such as {{the printing}} and coatings industry, wetting of porous materials by liquids includes not only imbibition and permeation into the bulk but also surface spreading and evaporation. By understanding these phenomena, valuable information can be obtained for improved process control, runnability and printability, in which liquid penetration and subsequent drying play important quality and economic roles. Knowledge {{of the position of}} the wetting front and the distribution/degree of pore filling within the structure is crucial in describing the transport phenomena involved. Although exemplifying paper as a porous medium in this work, the generalisation to dynamic liquid transfer onto a surface, including permeation and imbibition into porous media, is of importance to many industrial and naturally occurring environmental processes. This thesis explains the phenomena in the field of <b>heatset</b> web offset printing but the content and the analyses are applicable in many other printing methods and also other technologies where water/moisture monitoring is crucial {{in order to have a}} stable process and achieve high quality end products. The use of near-infrared technology to study the water and moisture response of porous pigmented structures is presented. The use of sensitive surface chemical and structural analysis, as well as the internal structure investigation of a porous structure, to inspect liquid wetting and distribution, complements the information obtained by spectroscopic techniques. Strong emphasis has been put on the scale of measurement, to filter irrelevant information and to understand the relationship between interactions involved. The near-infrared spectroscopic technique, presented here, samples directly the changes in signal absorbance and its variation in the process at multiple locations in a print production line. The in-line non-contact measurements are facilitated by using several diffuse reflectance probes, giving the absolute water/moisture content from a defined position in the dynamic process in real-time. The nearinfrared measurement data illustrate the changes in moisture content as the paper is passing through the printing nips and dryer, respectively, and the analysis of the mechanisms involved highlight the roles of the contacting surfaces and the relative liquid carrier properties of both non-image and printed image areas. The thesis includes laboratory studies on wetting of porous media in the form of coated paper and compressed pigment tablets by mono-, dual-, and multi-component liquids, and paper water/moisture content analysis in both offline and online conditions, thus also enabling direct sampling of temporal water/moisture profiles from multiple locations. One main focus in this thesis was to establish a measurement system which is able to monitor rapid changes in moisture content of paper. The study suggests that near-infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy can be used as a moisture sensitive system and to provide accurate online qualitative indicators, but, also, when accurately calibrated, can provide quantification of water/moisture levels, its distribution and dynamic liquid transfer. Due to the high sensitivity, samples can be measured with excellent reproducibility and good signal to noise ratio. Another focus of this thesis was on the evolution of the moisture content, i. e. changes in moisture content referred to (re) wetting, and liquid distribution during printing of coated paper. The study confirmed different wetting phases together with the factors affecting each phase both for a single droplet and a liquid film applied on a porous substrate. For a single droplet, initial capillary driven imbibition is followed by equilibrium pore filling and liquid retreat by evaporation. In the case of a liquid film applied on paper, the controlling factors defining the transportation were concluded to be the applied liquid volume in relation to surface roughness, capillarity and permeability of the coating giving the liquid uptake capacity. The printing trials confirmed moisture gradients in the printed sheet depending on process parameters such as speed, fountain solution dosage and drying conditions as well as the printed layout itself. Uneven moisture distribution in the printed sheet was identified to be one of the sources for waving appearance and the magnitude of waving was influenced by the drying conditions...|$|E
