5000|$|Hyperwords was a {{term used}} for <b>interactive</b> <b>text.</b> Whereas the term hyperlinks means {{words that are}} linked to {{specific}} destinations, hyperwords refers to enabling any word {{to be made to}} interact with other programs such as emails, dictionaries, on-line translators etc. through a simple set of commands.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{phenomenon}} of interactive narrativity, especially in codex-type texts. The aim of the thesis is to highlight the difficulties the current narratology has in coping {{with this kind of}} texts and to present an alternative approach to texts newly created mainly due to the development of modern technologies, the concept of cybertext postulated by Finnish theorist Espen Aarseth. Significant attention is focussed on the structural properties of this type of texts, which are the requirement of the feasibility of interactivity. The thesis is an attempt to assess generally both approaches and their advantages and disadvantages. The second part is devoted to an analysis of codex-type <b>interactive</b> <b>texts.</b> The aim of the list of selected literary works with an experimental structure is to demonstrate that <b>interactive</b> <b>texts</b> (or cybertexts) are based on the principles of traditional printed literature and are only an organic continuation of the experimental literature in another medium. A more detailed analysis of selected <b>interactive</b> <b>texts</b> aims to demonstrate the thesis of structural characteristics of <b>interactive</b> <b>texts...</b>|$|R

40|$|All {{about our}} {{digitally}} connected world <b>interactive</b> <b>texts</b> abound that display new ways for making meaning across social contexts. These texts communicate {{in new ways}} that no longer privilege written language as the primary conveyor of meaning. This to say that multimodality combined with new media technologies extends grammars to also include noisy and moving features. To attend to the shift in textual production from page-bound inscriptions to interactive designs, this chapter explores {{the ways in which}} the social life of digital texts transcend place-based settings to also include migratory spaces. As such, this chapter is also concerned with understanding reading and writing practices as it pertains to multimodal research. It explores issues surrounding dissertation and thesis design informed by sociocultural perspectives that articulate meanings beyond written language. To this end, I argue that fossilizing <b>interactive</b> <b>texts</b> has ethical implications for conducting empirical research that lends social and cultural insights...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} ActiveText, {{a method}} for creating dynamic and <b>interactive</b> <b>texts.</b> ActiveText uses an objectbased hierarchy to represent texts. This hierarchy {{makes it easy to}} work with the ASCII component and pixel component of the text at the same time. Static, dynamic and <b>interactive</b> properties of <b>text</b> can be easily intermixed and layered. The user can enter and edit text, adjust static and dynamic layout, apply dynamic and interactive behaviors, and adjust their parameters with a common set of tools and a common interface. Support for continuous editing allows the user to sketch dynamically. A prototype application called It's Alive! has been implemented to explore the ActiveText functionality. The documents produced by It's Alive! can be of use in a wide-range of areas, including chatspaces, email, web-sites, fiction and poetry writing, and low-end film & video titling...|$|R

40|$|The webdocumentary {{positions}} {{itself as}} documentary re-mediated {{for the internet}} age. Not only does the name webdocumentary consciously reference film and television documentary {{but it is possible}} to trace continuities in representational strategies, purpose and production practices that situate the webdoc within the documentary tradition. In spite of this family resemblance, however, the webdoc challenges current thinking about documentary representation. Interactivity in particular has consequences for theorizing in relation to modes of representation and user engagement. This article considers interactivity as a representational strategy, suggesting three dimensions for assessing its contribution to documentary. Following on from this it is suggested that, like film and television documentary, webdocs exhibit patterns of textual organization. It is suggested that {{there are at least three}} interactive structures found in webdocs: the narrative, the categorical and the collaborative. Each can be further divided â€“ indicating the diverse uses of interactive features. A challenge of researching <b>interactive</b> <b>texts</b> is that the whole text is never completely available for analysis. Each viewing has the potential to be different from the last. Although necessarily provisional, this article seeks to demonstrate what might be achieved through close reading of the <b>interactive</b> documentary <b>text...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to identify and interpret how spaces were differentiated by gender in visual images included in two award-winning English-learning software applications (Tell Me More and English at Home). The visual content analysis was based on examining the following values: home, workplace, street and neighborhood environment, leisure areas, and shop. Findings showed that females appeared as subordinate, financially dependent, and powerless; males as dominant, sporty, breadwinners, and powerful. Material writers, software developers, and instructors should be sensitized to such unfair positioning of gender and encouraged to promote alternative spatial discursive practices. Additionally, learners need to be well-informed and visually literate. It is argued that by discovering how females and males are positioned in contemporary <b>interactive</b> <b>texts,</b> consciously structured pictorial descriptions of gender can be articulated and contested in technology-based educational media to reflect gender equalit...|$|R
