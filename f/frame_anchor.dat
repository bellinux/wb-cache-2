We {{present a}} new technique for passive and markerless facial performance capture based on <b>anchor</b> <b>frames.</b> Our method starts with high resolution per-frame geometry acquisition using state-of-theart stereo reconstruction, and proceeds to establish a single triangle mesh that is propagated through the entire performance. Leveraging the fact that facial performances often contain repetitive subsequences, we identify <b>anchor</b> <b>frames</b> as those which contain similar facial expressions to a manually chosen reference expression. <b>Anchor</b> <b>frames</b> are automatically computed over one or even multiple performances. We introduce a robust image-space tracking method that computes pixel matches directly from the reference <b>frame</b> to all <b>anchor</b> <b>frames,</b> and thereby to the remaining frames in the sequence via sequential matching. This allows us to propagate one reconstructed frame to an entire sequence in parallel, in contrast to previous sequential methods. Our anchored reconstruction approach also limits tracker drift and robustly handles occlusions and motion blur. The parallel tracking and mesh propagation offer low computation times. Our technique will even automatically match <b>anchor</b> <b>frames</b> across different sequences captured on different occasions, propagating a single mesh to all performances...|$|R
40|$|This article {{reports on}} an {{experiment}} that examines {{the influence of}} message <b>framing</b> and <b>anchor</b> points, and the joint effect of these two information cues on Internet consumers' judgments regarding attitude, purchase intention and willingness to pay. The role of participants' subjective knowledge is also evaluated. The experimental results suggest that message framing, which describes a product's attribute in positive or negative terms, significantly influences participants' attitude toward and their intention to buy the product. In addition, participants' willingness to pay was significantly influenced by the presentation of anchors embedded in banner advertisements. Further, a significant interaction effect for message <b>framing</b> and <b>anchor</b> points indicate that their congruence enhances the effects of information presentation on people's responses. Specifically, describing a product attribute in positive terms along with a high anchor point induces more favorable response than any other <b>framing</b> and <b>anchoring</b> combinations. Finally, online shoppers who are low in product knowledge {{are more susceptible to}} <b>framing</b> and <b>anchoring</b> influences. The findings provide guidance for designing appropriate product and price cues to induce Internet consumer responses that favor online retailers. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

This paper aims {{to reveal}} the {{mechanical}} effects of metal holder and bolt (<b>anchor)</b> in <b>anchor</b> <b>frame</b> combination structure, then shows existing problems of <b>anchor</b> <b>frame</b> combination supporting structure being used in present coal mine, and gives corresponding solution {{on the basis of}} modern mechanics theory. By specify examples and on the basis of having administered the pull test of bolt (anchor), the article has calculated and analyzed the stress distribution rule of metal holder in <b>anchor</b> <b>frame</b> combination supporting structure according to the statically indeterminate principle in solid mechanics. In contrast to single metal holder structure, the consequence comes to be that the bearing capacity was significantly increased. However, the actual stress values of bolt (anchor) in field measurement shows that the bearing capacity of bolt (anchor) has hot been given full work. So the essay not only reveals the good bearing capacity of <b>anchor</b> <b>frame</b> combination structure but also points out that there is plenty of scope for optimization in <b>anchor</b> <b>frame</b> combination structure, and its research results have a certain reference for supporting theory and technology research in deep level and high ground pressure soft rock roadway...|$|R

40|$|The roof-to-wall {{connection}} {{in a house}} is designed to transfer the uplift and lateral loads during strong winds by providing a continuous load path from the roof to the foundation. The uplift capacity and failure mode of the connection depends on the number and type of fasteners (nails), timber species, type of <b>framing</b> <b>anchor,</b> and constructions defects. This paper presents experimental results {{that were used to}} assess the uplift capacity variation of typical roof-to-wall connections. Based on tests with two types of connections (triple grip and truss grip) assembled with two types of timber (radiata pine and spruce pine), nails (hand and gun), and <b>framing</b> <b>anchors</b> (triple grip and universal triple grip), the results show that the variation in timber species, nail, and triple grip type changes the strength and the failure modes of the connection. The strength of the connection was reduced by about 24 % when the timber species was changed from radiata pine to spruce pine and the hand nail to gun nail on the triple grip connection. This study also showed that construction defects in roof-to-wall connections influence the design uplift capacity. If there are two missing nails in the hand-nailed triple grip connection (i. e., one nail on the truss and another one on the top plate) the design uplift capacity reduces by about 40 % of the ideal hand-nailed triple grip connection. This study identified the critical nails and their locations required to mitigate failure of the roof-to-wall triple grip connection subject to wind loading...|$|R

We demonstrate that by adopting analysis parameters that naturally characterize this 'picture', the physical parameters of the system can be extracted more efficiently from the {{gravitational wave}} data, and interpreted more easily. We assess the performance of MCMC parameter estimation in this physically intuitive coordinate system, defined by (a) a <b>frame</b> <b>anchored</b> on the binary's spins and orbital angular momentum and (b) a time at which the detectors are most sensitive to the binary's gravitational wave emission. Using anticipated noise curves for the advanced-generation LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave detectors, we find that this careful choice of reference frame and reference time significantly improves parameter estimation efficiency for BNS, NS-BH, and BBH signals.

The development of astrometric facilities operating from space at a microarcsecond level of precision makes the non-uniformity of the galactic motion of the barycenter an observable and non-negligible effect that violates the desired inertiality of the barycentric frame of the solar system. Most of the observable effect is caused by the nearly-constant (secular) acceleration of the barycenter with respect {{to the center of the}} Galaxy. The acceleration results in a pattern of secular aberration which is observable astrometrically as a systematic vector field of the apparent proper motions of distant quasars.

40|$|The {{structural}} response {{and performance of}} connections are particularly important to assess the vulnerability of timber-framed structures to windstorms. Finite element (FE) analysis using ABAQUS (6. 12 - 3) software is {{used in this study}} to determine the {{structural response}} and uplift capacities of typical roof to wall connections. Results (i. e. force-displacement relationship and failure modes) of the FE model were compared with experimental tests and the model validated from the test results. The FE model accounts for large deformation as well as the contact between nail and timber through the elastic and post-elastic phases up to failure. The dominant failure modes observed are nails and <b>framing</b> <b>anchor</b> bending, and nail pull out. The FE model produced structural responses and uplift capacities that generally agree with the experimental results. Construction defects (i. e. missing nails) in a roof to wall connection influences the design uplift capacity. Nails located near the centre line of the loading action in a triple grip connection (i. e. common roof to wall connection used in the timber-framed house of Australia) significantly affect the stiffness of this connection. The response of these nails dominated the uplift capacity and failure types of triple grip connection to loading. Missing a nail in both truss and top-plate in the triple grip connection reduces the design uplift capacity by 40...|$|R

An encoded video stream consists of successive GOPs. A GOP can contain the following frame types: I-frame, P-frame, and B-frame. The order of intraframes and interframes is specified in a GOP. An I-frame is a reference picture which is intracoded corresponding to a fixed image and it is independent of other pictures. A P-frame is predictive-coded frame which contains motion-compensated difference information from the preceding I- or P-frame.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{threat of}} {{terrorist}} attack impacts our lives every day. Because this threat is very real, {{we have seen}} the use of bomb blast mitigating window designs grow significantly in recent years. Effective bomb blast mitigating window designs allow the window system to withstand a moderate bomb blast without causing significant injury to building occupants from the blast itself or flying glass shards. The occupants are protected because laminated glass, which can withstand the blast, is attached in the framing with a silicone sealant. The silicone sealant is {{an important component of the}} window design along with the glass composition, glass dimensions, the <b>framing,</b> <b>anchoring</b> of the <b>framing,</b> etc. Silicone sealants provide unique benefits to these window designs due to their strength properties and their ability to anchor the laminated glass in the framing during a blast situation. In addition, they provide long-term elasticity, adhesion and durability. The proper use and selection of silicone sealant is critical to the performance of these systems. In this paper, two commercially available high strength structural silicone sealants which are currently marketed for bomb blast mitigating window designs will be evaluated in high speed tensile testing to simulate loads on the sealant joint during a bomb blast. Sealant joints similar to those used in current bomb blast mitigating window designs will be tested in tension and shear. Results will be analyzed to determine the conditions for optimum sealant joint design...|$|R

40|$|Action {{recognition}} {{is an important}} problem in multimedia understanding. This paper addresses this problem by building an expressive compositional action model. We model one action instance in the video with an ensemble of spatio-temporal compositions: a number of discrete temporal <b>anchor</b> <b>frames,</b> {{each of which is}} further decomposed to a layout of deformable parts. In this way, our model can identify a Spatio-Temporal And-Or Graph (STAOG) to represent the latent structure of actions e. g. triple jumping, swinging and high jumping. The STAOG model comprises four layers: (i) a batch of leaf-nodes in bottom for detecting various action parts within video patches; (ii) the or-nodes over bottom, i. e. switch variables to activate their children leaf-nodes for structural variability; (iii) the and-nodes within an <b>anchor</b> <b>frame</b> for verifying spatial composition; and (iv) the root-node at top for aggregating scores over temporal <b>anchor</b> <b>frames.</b> Moreover, the contextual interactions are defined between leaf-nodes in both spatial and temporal domains. For model training, we develop a novel weakly supervised learning algorithm which iteratively determines the structural configuration (e. g. the production of leaf-nodes associated with the or-nodes) along with the optimization of multi-layer parameters. By fully exploiting spatio-temporal compositions and interactions, our approach handles well large intra-class action variance (e. g. different views, individual appearances, spatio-temporal structures). The experimental results on the challenging databases demonstrate superior performance of our approach over other competing methods.

The development of astrometric facilities operating from space at a microarcsecond level of precision makes the non-uniformity of the galactic motion of the barycenter an observable effect that violates the inertiality of the barycentric frame. Most of the observable effect is caused by secular acceleration of the barycenter with respect {{to the center of the}} Galaxy. The acceleration results in a pattern of secular aberration which is observable astrometrically as a systematic vector field of the proper motions of distant quasars. We employ the vector spherical harmonics to describe the predicted field of the proper motions and evaluate its amplitude at each point on the celestial sphere. It is shown that the pattern of secular aberration is fully represented by three low-order electric-type vector harmonics, and hence, it is easily distinguishable from the residual rotations of the reference frame and other possible effects, such as the hypothetical long-period gravitational waves. Comprehensive numerical simulations of the grid astrometry with SIM PlanetQuest are conducted. The full covariance matrix of the simulated grid solution is used to evaluate the covariances of the three electric harmonic coefficients, representing the secular aberration pattern of proper motions. We conclude that the grid astrometry with SIM PlanetQuest will be sensitive to the main galactocentric component of secular acceleration, while the peculiar acceleration of the Sun with respect to LSR is expected to be too small to be detected with this astrometric space interferometer.

40|$|Background The {{assessment}} of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) {{is dominated by}} core sets and indices {{that have been developed}} by RA professionals. Previous research developed a set of eight priority treatment outcomes generated by patients to complement the professionally developed core sets for RA. Objective This study aimed to facilitate quantitative measurement of these outcomes. Methods Two consultation meetings with patient research partners diagnosed with RA (n = 18) were held to identify face validity in existing instruments (Phase 1) at the Bristol Royal Infirmary. Where validated measures did not exist, new numerical rating scales (NRS) were constructed and discussed at two focus groups with patients diagnosed with RA (n = 8) at the Bristol Royal Infirmary and the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases (Phase 2). Feedback on the stem question, time <b>frame,</b> <b>anchors</b> and layout was recorded and transcribed verbatim. Results Of the eight priorities, existing NRS for pain, activities of daily living and fatigue were voted as acceptable (Phase 1), but new NRS were required for five priorities. The partners strongly recommended that the three separate domains of severity, effect and ability to cope in each measurement area be assessed, as in the existing validated fatigue NRS. Focus group participants (Phase 2) made significant contributions to the phrasing of questions, for example how to ensure ‘mobility’ could be uniformly understood and how changes in valued activities be judged appropriately. Conclusion Through extensive patient feedback, 24 NRS were constructed based on priorities identified by patients and encompassing domains where existing questionnaires contain many more items and do not address three important concepts endorsed by patients: severity, effect and coping.
