If the aircraft’s condition changes from stable to failure, for example, if one of the control surfaces becomes damaged and unresponsive, the IFCS can detect this fault and switch the <b>flight</b> <b>characteristic</b> model for the aircraft.

40|$|This paper aims {{to analyze}} the GPS traces of 258 volunteers for a better {{understanding}} of both the human mobility patterns and the mechanism. We report the regular and scaling properties of human mobility from several aspects, and importantly we identify its levy <b>flight</b> <b>characteristic</b> which is consistent with the previous studies. We further assume two factors that may govern the levy flight property: (1) the scaling and hierarchical properties of the purpose clusters which serve as the underlying spatial structure, and (2) the individual preferential behavior. To verify the assumptions, we implement an agent-based model with the two factors, and the simulated results indeed capture the same levy flight pattern as the observed one. In order to enable the model to reproduce more mobility patterns, we add the model a third factor, the jumping factor which means the probability that one person may cancel the regular mobility schedule and explore a random place. With this factor, our model could cover a relatively wide range of human mobility patterns with scaling exponent values from 1. 55 to 2. 05. QC 20121113 </p...|$|E

The direction and the distance to an obstacle are informed to the user as a vibration feedback pattern. The approach can be personalized according tocharacteristics of the user such as user’s height, vibration sensitivity, etc. A prototype of this approach has been used to conduct user evaluation experiments which were carried out in an unknown structured environment. Further analysis on familiarization process of this system, obstacle identification and confusions, comparative analysis between white cane and the system and effects of personalization to mobility were executed in order to gauge the effectiveness and the accuracy of the approach. The results of the evaluation have proved that the personalized system facilitate to improve the mobility of visually impaired people while giving an apparent consideration on the 3 D environment...|$|E
40|$|Austenitic {{pipes and}} other safety-relevant {{components}} of primary circuits in pressurized water reactors {{are subject to}} thermo-mechanical load cycles. Temperature gradients, turbulences and vibrations inside the circuit cause both low and high cycle fatigue and lead to microstructural changes and microcracks in the material. As of 2012, direct monitoring of this fatigue has not been implemented in German nuclear power plants. It would therefore be desirable to develop a monitoring concept based on established non-destructive testing techniques which {{would allow us to}} detect and Interpret microstructural material changes before macro-cracks occur. Electro-magnetic ultrasonic transducers (EMATs) are a promising technology for that purpose because they are high-temperature compatible and because the ultrasonic signal is sensitive to most microstructural changes that can appear during fatigue. For several years, Fraunhofer IZFP and the Materials Science Institute of TU Kaiserslautern have been closely collaborating in several major projects dedicated to this problem. Both low and high cycle fatigue tests were performed, thus representing the real fatigue processes occurring inside the surge line of a primary circuit. During fatigue tests on austenitic specimens at realistic temperature, ultrasonic in situ measurements were carried out, In which the measured Parameters were the ultrasonic amplitude and time of <b>flight.</b> <b>Characteristic</b> changes in cyclic deformation behavior as well as in these Parameters were observed.

40|$|As {{aircraft}} systems {{continue to}} become more integrated and fully electronic, hence fly-by-wire, the pilot is slowly losing the physical cues that were once relied upon for the safe operation of the aircraft. Many commercial airliners, such as Airbus, use passive sidesticks that integrate with the electronic flight controls system. These sidesticks move much like a gaming joystick which results in the pilot not having any “feel” for the aerodynamic forces present on the control surfaces. Without the force feedback of a mechanically linked control system the pilot could inadvertently stall the aircraft or place it into an unstable flight condition. To combat this, the active sidestick will include a servo mechanism to provide force feedback and use strain gauges to determine the force applied to the sidestick by the pilot. Multiple sources of data, such as the aircraft configuration and critical speeds {{can be used to}} produce a force gradient which resist a pilot’s inputs if they are exceeding the aircraft capabilities. The active sidestick will interface with PC based flight simulation to control an aircraft and receive <b>flight</b> <b>characteristic</b> data to properly adjust the forces present on the sidestick. Being solely based on force input for aircraft control, if there were to be an in-flight failure of the servos the pilot would still be able to control the aircraft by force alone. Such a sidestick could be used in any number of aviation applications; it would improve the safety of unmanned aircraft operations in which the pilot/operator receives no tactile feedback at the controls. It could also become physically small enough and cost effective to be outfitted in modern general aviation aircraft to prevent the all-too-common loss of control scenario upon landing or takeoff...|$|E
40|$|The {{continuous}} {{progression of}} urbanization {{has resulted in}} {{an increasing number of}} people living in cities or towns. In parallel, advancements in technologies, such as the Internet, telecommunications, and transportation, have allowed for better connectivity among people. This has engendered drastic changes in urban systems during the recent decades. From a social geographic perspective, the changes in urban systems are primarily characterized by intensive contacts among people and their interactions with the surrounding urban environment, which further leads to subsequent challenging problems such as traffic jams, environmental pollution, urban sprawl, etc. These problems have been reported to be heterogeneous and non-deterministic. Hence, to cope with them, massive amounts of geographic data are required to create new knowledge on urban systems. Due to the thriving of Volunteer Geographic Information (VGI) in recent years, this thesis presents knowledge on urban systems based on extensive VGI datasets from three sources: highway dataset from the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project, photo location dataset from the Flickr website, and GPS tracking datasets from volunteers, taxicabs, and air flights. The knowledge primarily relates to two issues of urban systems: the urban space and the corresponding human dynamics. In accordance, on one hand, urban space acts as a carrier for associated geographic activities and knowledge of it benefits our understanding of current social and economic problems in urban systems. On the other hand, human dynamics reflect human behavior in urban space, which leads to complex mobility or activity patterns. Its investigation allows a derivation of the underlying driving force that is very instructive to urban planning, traffic management, and infectious disease control. Therefore, to fully understand the two issues, this thesis conducts a thorough investigation from multiple aspects. The first issue is investigated from four aspects. First, at the city level, the controversial topic of city size regularity is investigated in terms of natural cities, and the conclusion is that Zipf’s law holds stably for all US cities. Second, at the sub-city level, the size distribution of spatial units within different cities in terms of the clusters formed by street nodes, photo locations, and taxi static points are explored, and the result shows a remarkable scaling property of these spatial units. Third, enlightened by the scaling property of the urban space at the city or sub-city level, this thesis devises a novel tool that can demarcate the cities into three categories: compact cities, normal cities, and sprawling cities. The tool is then applied to cities in both the US and three European countries. In the last, another representation of urban space is taken into account, namely the transportation network. The findings report that the US airport network displays the properties of scale-free, small-world, and disassortative mixing and that the individual natural airports show heterogeneous patterns that are probably subject to geographic constraints and socioeconomic factors. The second issue is examined from four perspectives. First, at the city level, the movement flow contributed by agents using two types of behavior is investigated through an agent-based simulation, and the result conjectures that the human mobility behavior is mainly shaped by the underlying street network. Second, at the country level, this thesis reports that the human travel length by air can be approximated well by an exponential distribution, and subsequent simulations indicate that human mobility behavior is largely constrained by the underlying airport network. Third, at the regional level, the length that humans travel by car is demonstrated to agree well with a power law with exponential cutoff distribution, and subsequent simulation further reproduces this levy <b>flight</b> <b>characteristic.</b> Based on the simulation, human mobility behavior is again revealed to be primarily shaped by the underlying hierarchical spatial structure. Finally, taxicab static points are adopted to explore human activity patterns, which can be characterized as the regularities in space and time, the heterogeneity and predictability in space. From a complex system perspective, this thesis presents the knowledge discovered in urban systems using massive volumes of geographic data. Together with new knowledge from empirical findings, the development of methods, and the design of theoretic models, this thesis also shares the research community with geographic data generated from extensive VGI datasets and the corresponding source codes. Moreover, this study is aligned with a paradigm shift in that it analyzes large-size datasets using high processing power as opposed to analyzing small-size datasets with low processing power.
