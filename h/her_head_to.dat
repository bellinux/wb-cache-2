Euryale sought revenge against Kratos for killing her sister Medusa, but was killed and decapitated; as with Medusa, Kratos took <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> {{use it as a}} weapon to turn enemies to stone.

5|$|From a young age, Jackson {{was exposed}} to sex. He {{received}} mixed messages on the subject from his parents. His mother Katherine was a devout Jehovah's Witness and conveyed her thoughts clearly; lust in thought or deed was sinful outside of marriage, and physical intimacy should be saved for marriage. In contrast to his wife, father Joseph, a steel mill worker, shunned the religion and would have The Jackson 5 perform at strip clubs and seedy bars in {{the earliest days of}} their career. He allowed nine-year-old Michael to watch from the wings of the stage as male audience members whistled at women who stripped until nude. In one incident, a fascinated Michael watched as an apparently big breasted female removed all but her underwear. The stripper then proceeded to reach into her bra, removing two large oranges and the wig from <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> <b>to</b> reveal that the person he thought was a female was not a woman at all.|$|E
5|$|Knowles rehearsed {{the pole}} dancing using two ballet bars, which {{was when it}} was decided to add a pole above <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> form an arc. Though she is from Texas, she had never {{previously}} been on mechanical bull. There were no problems during warm-ups, but the man operating the bull during the video shoot programmed it to go faster, causing Knowles to fall off when she tried to perform tricks such as lifting up her foot, leaning back and turning around. To minimize the time Knowles spent on the bull, the director shot the sequence at twelve frames per second (see frame rate) and Knowles sang twice as quickly, but it wasn't until 4:00am that they completed work.|$|E

5|$|Manjrekar {{had worked}} with Priya Bapat in Me Shivajiraje Bhosale Boltoy (2009) and had {{mentioned}} about Kaksparsh to her. He desired Bapat to play the lead role of Uma, however the film couldn't start as planned. When Manjrekar planned for the film, he called Bapat again who got married to Umesh Kamat in the meantime. Manjrekar had seen 2011 National Award-winning film Shala and was impressed with a teen-aged character played by Ketaki Mategaonkar and decided to cast her as a young Uma. Savita Malpekar was cast {{to play the role}} of Khedekar's widowed aunt. Malpekar had to shave <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> prepare for the role. Manjrekar insisted that the film cast including Savita Malpekar should shave the head for their roles and avoid wearing a prosthetic bald patch.|$|E
5|$|On the train, they inject Rain and Kaplan {{with the}} anti-virus. However, the Licker is hiding {{on the train}} and attacks them, clawing Matt and killing Kaplan. In the ensuing battle, Alice subdues the Licker before Matt is {{attacked}} by a now-zombified Rain. He shoots Rain dead, causing <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> hit a trapdoor button, opening it and dropping the Licker under the train which ultimately kills it for good. At the mansion, Matt's wound begins mutating. Before Alice can give him the anti-virus, the mansion doors burst open {{and a group of}} Umbrella scientists seizes them. They subdue Alice and take Matt away, revealing he is to be put into the Nemesis Program.|$|E
5|$|Uma {{decides to}} go on a fast and relents to none of the family member's request to quit. Hari, left with no other option, {{explains}} his behaviour. Hari reveals to Uma that when he was performing death rituals for Mahadev and offerings were not accepted by crow for a long time, he took a vow that he would not let any other man touch Uma. Thus, he did not allow practised rituals of shaving <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> be performed and also declined Tara's request of their marriage. When he learned through Tara that Uma has started loving him, he stopped talking to her, in spite of his love towards Uma.|$|E

The goal umpire {{shows that a}} goal has been scored by {{pointing}} both index fingers {{in front of him}} at waist level and then waving two flags above his or <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> indicate the score to the other goal umpire. A behind is signalled by pointing one finger and waving one flag.|$|E
25|$|In {{first half}} {{stoppage}} time Arsenal fell behind again when Faye White, {{under pressure from}} Jill Scott, used <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> divert Toni Duggan's high left-wing cross past Emma Byrne and into her own goal.

25|$|In {{her late}} teenage years, Plimpton was also active in theater, {{performing}} in regional theater in Seattle, Washington, {{where her mother}} was living at the time. She also began a career making small independent film appearances with supporting roles in big-budget films. She appeared in the 1988 Woody Allen film Another Woman. She co-starred with Jami Gertz as a cancer patient in the German film Zwei Frauen (1990) (released in America as Silence Like Glass). The film was nominated for Outstanding Feature Film at the German Film Awards. Plimpton shaved <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> play a cancer patient in Zwei Frauen.|$|E

25|$|V. acadica males readily {{attempt to}} mate with the queens. Males {{approach}} the queens from the side and attempt to mount the dorsum of the queen's gaster. The queen often attempts to turn and face the male in order to bite him. The male continues to follow the queen, and mounts her while grasping her thorax with all 6 of his legs. He then curls his gaster under the abdomen of the queen in order to insert his genitalia. If the queen is unreceptive, she will curl her gaster toward <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> form a C-shape to prevent penetration and use her legs to dislodge the male.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{the human}} pyramid {{to the right}} has a {{vigorous}} vertical thrust. The writhing of the woman tied to the horse, the upward reaching stretch of the figure to her left, the shocking mane of the horse, and the twisting and commanding figure of the soldier upon it, all give dynamism to the grouping as it rises. But {{at the foot of}} the pyramid, an old woman raises <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> gaze into the sky, and to her right a baby seeks maternal comfort from a clenched-fisted corpse. Body parts including a hand and forearm, and an indistinct, congealed bloody mass hover grimly above the infant.|$|E
25|$|Ángela Peralta {{died in the}} Hotel Iturbide in Mazatlán {{at the age of}} 38 on 30 August 1883. She {{married her}} lover Julián Montiel y Duarte on her deathbed. According to an {{eyewitness}} account of the marriage ceremony, she was already unconscious when it took place. One of the singers from her company, Lemus, supported her by the shoulders. When asked if she took Montiel y Duarte as her husband, Lemus moved <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> make it appear that she was nodding her assent. Before her burial in Mazatlán, her body lay in state, dressed in one of her opera costumes and her best jewels. In 1937, her remains were disinterred and brought to the Rotunda de Hombres Ilustres (the Rotunda of Illustrious People) in Mexico City's Panteón de Dolores. Both Mazatlán and San Miguel de Allende have theatres named in her honour.|$|E

25|$|In Greek mythology snakes {{are often}} {{associated}} with deadly and dangerous antagonists, {{but this is not}} to say that snakes are symbolic of evil; in fact, snakes are a chthonic symbol, roughly translated as 'earthbound'. The nine-headed Lernaean Hydra that Hercules defeated and the three Gorgon sisters are children of Gaia, the earth. Medusa was one of the three Gorgon sisters who Perseus defeated. Medusa is described as a hideous mortal, with snakes instead of hair and the power to turn men to stone with her gaze. After killing her, Perseus gave <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> Athena who fixed it to her shield called the Aegis. The Titans are also depicted in art with snakes instead of legs and feet for the same reason—they are children of Gaia and Uranus, so they are bound to the earth.|$|E
25|$|Helen is safely away {{to recover}} from her concussion. Inspector Morton asks each family member to account for {{themselves}} {{on the day of}} Cora Lansquenet's murder after which Poirot makes a surprising statement which shocked everyone present. Cora had not come to the funeral at all. It was Miss Gilchrist in disguise, as part of a plot for her own gain, leaving Cora home asleep from a sedative in her tea. Miss Gilchrist planted the idea that Richard Abernethie's death had been a murder - when Cora is murdered, it would seem that Richard's alleged murderer had killed Cora to silence her. None of the family had seen Cora for more than two decades, due to the ill-feeling {{at the time of her}} marriage. Miss Gilchrist copied her mannerisms and the only flaw in her portrayal was spotted by Helen Abernethie - Miss Gilchrist had rehearsed a characteristic turn of the head in a mirror, where the reflection is a reverse of reality; when she came to the house after the funeral, she turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> the left, not the right. After a timely conversation among the young cousins, Helen realises this difference. Miss Gilchrist gave herself away to Poirot by referring to the wax flowers on the green malachite table the first day the relatives gathered to select objects before the auction: these were on display on the day of the reading of Richard Abernethie's will but removed by the time Miss Gilchrist, as herself, visited Enderby Hall. She had deliberately poisoned herself with the arsenic-laced wedding cake to evade suspicion and appear yet another potential victim, which aroused suspicion.|$|E
