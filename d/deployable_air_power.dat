40|$|This thesis {{examines}} whether traditional <b>air</b> <b>power</b> theory complements counterinsurgency <b>air</b> <b>power</b> {{theory in}} kinetic counterinsurgency operations. The reason being {{that there is}} some discrepancy in the theories of how <b>air</b> <b>power</b> can be used in counterinsurgency. Winning a revolutionary war requires a graduated spectrum of violence; whereas, traditionally <b>air</b> <b>power</b> is characterized as only using the kinetic, hard power, end of that spectrum. The purpose is to test Robert Pape’s <b>air</b> <b>power</b> theory of military coercion by denial, motivated by the theory’s agreement with current research of <b>air</b> <b>power</b> in counterinsurgency. This thesis is a comparative case study examining two, similar and successful counterinsurgency operations, Operation Anaconda and Operation Medusa. Findings show that denial is quite prominent when direct support of ground forces occurs; whereas operational and strategic interdiction indicate low or no occurrence. This study strengthens the theory’s applicatory power in a counterinsurgency context, and suggests it can complement current research on counterinsurgency <b>air</b> <b>power</b> in kinetic usage.   Uppsatsen skriven VT 2017 under Termin 4 Officersprogrammet 15 - 18 med inriktning mot flyg.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe thesis argues that <b>air</b> <b>power</b> now dominates modern warfare. The overwhelming {{victory of the}} Gulf War stands {{as a symbol of}} the maturity of <b>air</b> <b>power.</b> In effect, technology has caught up with nearly a century of <b>air</b> <b>power</b> theory, the early prophets of <b>air</b> <b>power</b> were basically correct. The air war in the Gulf was revolutionary in the sense that very few bombs were required to achieve an enormous amount of very focused, precise destruction. The existence of precision guided munitions allows single aircraft to accomplish what, in the past, would have taken literally thousands of aircraft to accomplish or could not have been accomplished at all. The argument is based on a comparison of the employment of <b>air</b> <b>power</b> in previous conflicts. A comparison is then made with the employment of <b>air</b> <b>power</b> in the Gulf War. In the context of modern war, the implications of the air war in the Gulf have profound implications for every warfare specialty.

40|$|The <b>Air</b> <b>Power</b> {{theories}} of today are often written from a superior air force perspective where the overall {{focus is on}} the offensive nature of <b>Air</b> <b>Power.</b> Very little is spoken about <b>Air</b> <b>Power</b> and its defensive role as well as the inferior states opportunities against superior opponents. A state that successfully has used <b>Air</b> <b>Power</b> through history is Israel. During both the Six Day War in 1967 and Yom Kippur in 1973, Israel faced superior opponents consisting of a coalition of Arab states, including Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Iraq. Despite Israel being the initially inferior state during both wars, they managed to gain initiative against the superior Arab states. This study will set the <b>Air</b> <b>Power</b> {{theories of}} Philip S Meilinger to a test through a validation process against two cases, the Six Day War in 1967 and Yom Kippur in 1973. The aim is to analyse the Israeli air force during these two wars. The main goal is to try to explain how inferior states can succeed against superior opponents through <b>Air</b> <b>Power.</b> The result of the study demonstrates that an inferior state has the opportunity to achieve success through <b>Air</b> <b>Power</b> against superior opponents. The analyses of Meilingers theories indicates that high readiness, early employment of forces, use of <b>Air</b> <b>Powers</b> psychological effect and timing constitutes successful factors in gaining initiative. An additional important factor for achieving success through these variables is highly relevant intelligence. ...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. History {{is full of}} with examples of innovations that have proved essential to victory in war. Few innovations have provided the consistent and often decisive impact that <b>air</b> <b>power</b> has delivered in conflict. Across its relatively short history, the concept of <b>air</b> <b>power</b> has maintained a resiliency of innovation across the doctrinal, strategic, organizational, and technological levels. However, warfare itself has witnessed significant changes {{over the course of}} the last century. No longer is the classical, conventional state-on-state conflict the principal method of combating ones enemies. In its place, irregular warfare (IW) has arguably become the norm in conflict today. However, we have yet to see <b>air</b> <b>power</b> applied to modern-era irregular conflicts with the same level of success achieved in past conflicts. This thesis examines the use of <b>air</b> <b>power</b> in IW in order to answer the following questions What organizational forms are associated with the successful use of <b>air</b> <b>power</b> in irregular warfare What technologies What concepts of operations What level of coherence between strategic and operational/tactical execution is associated with the successful use of <b>air</b> <b>power</b> in IW And finally, what should the future role of <b>air</b> <b>power</b> in IW beMajor, United States Air Forc...|$|R
