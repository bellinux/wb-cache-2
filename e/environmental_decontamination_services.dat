40|$|Anthrax occurs {{worldwide}} and {{is associated with}} sudden death of cattle and sheep. This paper considers an epidemic model of anthrax in animal population, only. The susceptible animal {{is assumed to be}} infected, only, through ingestion of the disease causing pathogens. The proposed model incorporates time delay and <b>environmental</b> <b>decontamination</b> by humans. The time delay represents the period an infected animal needs to succumb to anthrax-related death. By constructing suitable Lyapunov functionals, we demonstrate that the global dynamics of this model fully hinges on whether the associated reproductive number is greater or less than unity. The effectiveness of <b>environmental</b> <b>decontamination</b> on eradication of anthrax in the community is explored through the reproductive number...|$|R

The NAS also provides a Neonatal Intensive Care emergency ambulance service and a Mobile Intensive Care Unit which are available 24-hours a day nationwide to transport their respective patients and medical teams to specialised facilities.|$|R
40|$|Background Staphylococcus aureus is {{the leading}} cause of {{hospital}} acquired infections. Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is the second most common healthcare associated infection in the healthcare system. A bacterium resistant to the antibiotic drug, methicillin, MRSA can make treatment for serious chronic illnesses difficult, leading to morbidity and mortality. Objective The primary purpose of this study is to provide a systematic review of all research articles pertaining to the effectiveness of personal hygiene and <b>environmental</b> <b>decontamination</b> in controlling the transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Methods Databases PubMed, Global Health, and Medline were searched for research articles relevant to reducing MRSA acquisition using personal hygiene practices or <b>environmental</b> <b>decontamination</b> procedure. The keywords MSRA, MDRO, decontamination, hygiene, prevention, and clean were used to assist in identifying these articles. Full text articles were assessed to ensure they met inclusion criteria. Data was collected from each article regarding study time, location, outcome of interest, statistical result, and study design. Results Of the articles included in this systematic review, 9 of 10 reported a significant decrease in MRSA acquisition in a healthcare or correctional facility setting after implementation of improved personal hygiene practices or <b>environmental</b> <b>decontamination.</b> There is an increased need for compliance with appropriate hygiene practices in a healthcare setting by healthcare workers. Further research needs to be conducted on the cost effectiveness of decontamination processes and educational programs to encourage compliance with MRSA policies that are already set in place by hospitals worldwide...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{contamination}} {{is being}} increasingly {{recognized as a}} significant source of healthcare-associated infection (HAI). Cross-contamination of the patient from the environment can result from the direct transfer of organisms from the air and surfaces, or indirectly from the hospital environment via contact with healthcare workers or equipment. Traditional methods of <b>environmental</b> <b>decontamination,</b> including cleaning with disinfectants, and the standard infection control procedures implemented by modern Health Services, are critical to controlling the spread of potentially pathogenic microbial contaminants from environmental sources to the patient; however there is constant pressure to maintain, and indeed, improve on the standards that are in place to ensure optimal patient care. To address this issue, much research has been directed towards the development and testing of novel ‘whole-room’ <b>environmental</b> <b>decontamination</b> methods which could be used to enhance hospital hygiene, and consequently reduce the risk of HAI-acquisition from environmental sources. Gaseous methods {{such as the use of}} hydrogen peroxide, chlorine dioxide, ozone and steam, as well as ultraviolet and violet-blue visible light methods have all been laboratory tested, and to varying extents, clinically evaluated to assess their efficacy for <b>environmental</b> <b>decontamination.</b> This review article considers these different decontamination technologies, discussing their mechanism of action, antimicrobial efficacy, and advantages and limitations, with a view to providing the reader with a comprehensive overview of the technological advances being developed to reduce the levels of environmental contamination around patient areas, thus aiding in the fight against healthcare-associated infection...|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} <b>environmental</b> <b>decontamination</b> {{is a key}} step in a {{successful}} response to a large-scale attack involving a biological agent. Costs for the decontamination response following the 2001 anthrax attacks were estimated {{in the hundreds of}} millions of dollars, and some facilities could not be reopened for more than 2 years. However, a large-scale biological attack would likely result in an even greater amount of contamination, more areas that need to be cleaned and made safe, and a much greater cost to the American public. This article identifies gaps in decontamination policy and technical practice at the federal level and provides practical recommendations that will better enable the U. S. to undertake a biological decontamination response. The process of environmental decontamination—that is, removing biological hazards from buildings, vehicles, and outdoor areas—is a key step in a successful response to a large-scale attack involving a biological agent.

50|$|VHF {{isolation}} guidelines {{dictate that}} all VHF patients (with {{the exception of}} dengue patients) should be cared for using strict contact precautions, including hand hygiene, double gloves, gowns, shoe and leg coverings, and faceshield or goggles. Lassa, CCHF, Ebola, and Marburg viruses may be particularly prone to nosocomial (hospital-based) spread. Airborne precautions should be utilized including, at a minimum, a fit-tested, HEPA filter-equipped respirator (such as an N-95 mask), a battery-powered, air-purifying respirator, or a positive pressure supplied air respirator to be worn by personnel coming within 1,8 meter (six feet) of a VHF patient. Multiple patients should be cohorted (sequestered) to a separate building or a ward with an isolated air-handling system. <b>Environmental</b> <b>decontamination</b> is typically accomplished with hypochlorite (e.g. bleach) or phenolic disinfectants.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{exciting}} and most studied uses of photo catalysis is the photo-oxidation of organics as it applies to <b>environmental</b> <b>decontamination.</b> In contrast to gas phase interactions with the solid surface, the vast number of variables associated with the liquid solid interface (i.e. solution pH, photocatalyst concentration, solvent effects, diffusion rate, etc.) calls for greater care to be taken to control these variables to produce consistent experimental results. A greater variety of reactions also become possible due to the ability of solutions to stabilize charged species, making it possible to add an electron from the metal to a neutral species producing an anion that can go on to further react, or a hole to remove an electron, producing a cation that goes on to further react in solution.|$|R

30|$|The {{surface of}} TiO 2 could be {{effectively}} functionalized by depositing nanoparticulates of WO 3 by magnetron sputtering method. Microscopic analyses showed that TiO 2 nanoparticles were nonspherical, irregular in shape, and < 50  nm in size while WO 3 nanoparticles were well distributed throughout TiO 2 surface and were smaller (< 20  nm) in size {{as compared to}} TiO 2. Improvement in photocurrent and photocatalytic activity of TiO 2 thin film was observed, approximately 50 % and approximately 40 %, respectively, after surface modification with WO 3 nanoparticles. Both the films, TiO 2 and WO 3 /TiO 2, showed the highest photocurrent under 320 -nm radiation, which continuously decreased with decreasing photonic energy. This study has presented a representative example by investigating the photoelectrochemical and the photochemical behavior of WO 3 -modified TiO 2 thin film; this simple and effective methodology {{could be applied to}} develop other mixed-metal oxides for solar energy conversion and <b>environmental</b> <b>decontamination.</b>|$|R
40|$|A novel thermal {{deposition}} method {{was developed to}} coat Ca(OH) 2 {{on the surface of}} nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI). The nZVI particles with the Ca(OH) 2 coating layer, nZVI/Ca(OH) 2, had a clear core-shell structure based on the transmission electron microscopy observations, and the Ca(OH) 2 shell was identified as an amorphous phase. The Ca(OH) 2 coating shell would not only function as an effective protection layer for nZVI but also improve the mobility of nZVI in porous media for its use in <b>environmental</b> <b>decontamination.</b> A 10 % Ca/Fe mass ratio was found to result in a proper thickness of the Ca(OH) 2 shell on the nZVI surface.
