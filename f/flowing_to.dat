40|$|FDI <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> the MENA {{region have}} been disappointing {{relative}} to other developing countries. Using fixed effects panel regressions, this paper investigates whether the determinants of FDI affect MENA countries differently.

These include the rate of return on investment, infrastructures, economic growth, and inflation. While trade openness increases FDI <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> MENA countries, corruption/bureaucratic red tape were found <b>to</b> reduce <b>flows</b> <b>to</b> the region.

This situation did not last long; another 'A' Force alumnus, Lieutenant Colonel David Strangeways, was brought over to head up R Force, the operational deception unit of the 21st Army Group. Strangeways and Wild clashed on a personal and professional level. Eventually, Strangeways rewrote large portions of the Fortitude South plan, and pushed Ops (B) into a more supporting role.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} low (0. 08 microU g- 1 body wt min- 1) and high (0. 16 microU g- 1 body wt min- 1) rates of {{vasopressin}} infusion on blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> normal liver tissue and to liver metastases derived from azoxymethane induced colorectal carcinomas was studied in 36 male Wistar rats. Portal venous flow {{was measured by}} electromagnetic flowmetry and blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> normal and metastatic liver tissue by the clearance of xenon- 133 injected directly into the liver parenchyma or metastasis. The low rate of vasopressin infusion decreased portal venous flow but increased blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> normal and metastatic liver tissue while at the higher rate of infusion these effects were reversed. Hepatic artery ligation (HAL) immediately following a low rate of vasopressin infusion abolished the observed increase in blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> both normal liver tissue and metastases. HAL immediately following the higher rate of vasopressin infusion further reduced blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> metastases but did not further alter blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> normal liver tissue. HAL prior to the infusion of the vasoactive drug significantly reduced blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> metastatic liver tissue, increased portal venous flow and was without effect on blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> normal liver tissue. Following HAL, blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> metastatic liver tissue was not further altered by either the low or high rates of vasopressin infusion. However, blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> normal liver tissue after HAL was reduced by a low rate of infusion of vasopressin and increased by the higher rate of infusion. The {{results of this study}} indicate that blood <b>flow</b> <b>to</b> normal or metastatic liver tissue can be increased or decreased by differential rates of infusion of vasopressin. These observations may have important implications in the treatment of liver metastases in man where different rates of vasopressin infusion may potentiate the effects of hepatic artery ligation or cytotoxic therapy...|$|R
