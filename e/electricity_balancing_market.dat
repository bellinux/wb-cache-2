40|$|An {{increase}} in energy production from {{renewable energy sources}} {{is viewed as a}} crucial achievement in most industrialized countries. The higher variability of power production via renewables leads to a rise in ancillary service costs over the power system, in particular costs within the <b>electricity</b> <b>balancing</b> <b>markets,</b> mainly due to an increased number of extreme price spikes. This study focuses on forecasting the behavior of price and volumes of the Italian <b>balancing</b> <b>market</b> in the presence of an increased share of renewable energy sources. Starting from configurations of load and power production, which guarantee a stable performance, we implement fluctuations in the load and in renewables; in particular we artificially increase the contribution of renewables as compared to conventional power sources to cover the total load. We then forecast the amount of provided energy in the <b>balancing</b> <b>market</b> and its fluctuations, which are induced by production and consumption. Within an approach of agent based modeling we estimate the resulting energy prices and costs.

40|$|The {{integration}} of the increasing share of fluctuating renewable energy sources into the energy system requires more options in flexibility. A promising attempt is the power-to-gas concept (PtG) which allows the production of hydrogen and synthetic natural gas (SNG) from electricity and the storage in caverns or existing gas storage facilities. However, an economic operation in Germany is not expected before 2030, when the amount of surplus energy, mainly generated in wind parks, will be sufficient. Currently, a hardly analyzed aspect is the potential commercialization of the flexible electrolysis as controllable load on the <b>electricity</b> <b>balancing</b> <b>market.</b> This offers opportunities to generate additional revenues and to obtain cheap electricity {{in the form of}} balancing energy. The present article has been designed to analyze this aspect and to examine the impact of a potential commercialization of balancing energy on the gas production costs within the PtG concept. At first, the current legal framework, the funding instruments of SNG and the differences between the notion "Speichergas" and Biogas will be outlined. An overview of the current balancing market will be given and the development of prices on the secondary balancing market will be evaluated as well as expected market trends will be presented. The following calculation of gas production costs, which result from applying an optimal proposal strategy on the secondary balancing market, is model-based and uses historical data. Three scenarios are defined and examined, and the impact of variable electricity prices is analyzed. The <b>electricity</b> <b>balancing</b> <b>market</b> is profitable and offers many opportunities for PtG plants. The results show a decrease of SNG production costs by up to 74 % to 46, 9 €/MWh. As for the hydrogen, the production costs amount to approximately 25, 8 € /MWh which equals a cost reduction of up to 81 % compared to conventional PtG plants without commercialization of balancing energy...|$|E

Our results suggest that payoff scale matters in firms' willingness and ability to participate in complex, strategic market environments.

The supermarkets are able to shift the power consumption in time by pre-cooling the contained foodstuff. It is shown how the flexibility of an individual supermarket can be modeled and how this model {{can be used by}} an aggregator to manage the portfolio to deliver upward and downward regulation. Two control {{strategies for}} managing the portfolio to follow a power reference are presented and compared. The first strategy is a non-convex predictive control strategy while the second strategy consists of a PI controller and a dispatch algorithm. The predictive controller has a high performance but is computationally heavy. In contrast the PI/dispatch strategy has lower performance, but requires little computational effort and scales well with the number of supermarkets. Two simulations are conducted based on high-fidelity supermarket models: a small-scale simulation with 20 supermarkets where the performance of the two strategies are compared and a large-scale simulation with 400 supermarkets which only the PI/dispatch controller is able to handle. The large-scale simulation shows how a portfolio of 400 supermarkets successfully can be used for upward regulation of 900 kW for a two hour period...|$|E

In recent years, the electricity market has been going {{through the process of}} liberalization, which has contributed to the provision of new services for investors interested in the {{development of}} the energy industry. Recently, one of the most rapidly growing sources of electricity has been wind farms. Few investors are aware of the consequences of connecting wind farms to the national power grid, as well as of the subsequent exploitation of these resources. After the Electricity Sales Contract has been concluded, investors agree to predict electrical capacity generation within the span of 24 hours with a daily advance. The specific nature of wind farm functioning makes the prediction of electrical capacity generation difficult and, consequently, the owners bear the costs of deviations on the <b>electricity</b> <b>balancing</b> <b>market.</b> The resulting costs may result in the lack of liquidity of the project owner and, ultimately, in bankruptcy.

40|$|The {{share of}} {{microgeneration}} (power generation {{at the level}} of households and small businesses) in the Dutch electricity system continues to grow. Over time, this development may pose a threat to the reliability and efficiency of the Dutch <b>electricity</b> <b>balancing</b> <b>market.</b> We investigated possible changes to the design of the Dutch balancing market that can maintain or even improve upon its current operational performance level. The first step of the research was an analysis of the existing Dutch balancing market. It consists of three main instruments: programme responsibility, the single buyer market for regulating and reserve power (RRP), and imbalance settlement. The balancing market currently functions satisfactorily. Subsequently, the effects of large-scale development of microgeneration in the Netherlands were evaluated with a qualitative scenario analysis. Four microgeneration scenarios and two methods for allocating the household electricity consumption and generation were considered. The four scenarios concerned large-scale penetration of PV, heat-led micro CHP, electricity-led micro CHP operated by the household consumer, and electricity-led micro CHP operated by the supply company. The last scenario was found to have the strongest positive net effect. Finally, six design options were identified for improving the Dutch balancing market design in case the share of microgeneration would increase substantially. Of these six options, adjusting the profile methodology and the regulation of smart meters are no-regret options that can be implemented immediately. The attractiveness of the other options depends upon the microgeneration portfolio that emerges, the manageability of large metering data flows, {{and the nature of the}} technical effects of large-scale microgeneration penetration.

40|$|The article {{examines}} how renewable electricity (RES-E) producers are {{integrated into the}} electricity market under the support legislations and regulatory frameworks of Germany, Spain, and the UK. Focus is on wind power, which faces the highest market integration challenge of all RES-E. The analysis shows that the three countries follow contrasting approaches of exposing RES-E producers to the market risks of forward <b>electricity</b> <b>markets,</b> <b>balancing</b> <b>markets</b> and system planning requirements. Risk exposure is highest in the UK and lowest in Germany. From a policy maker's perspective, there is a trade-off between a "high risk" and a "low risk" approach. When RES-E face high market risks, {{a higher level of}} financial support is required to stimulate RES-E development than in a low risk environment, but the exposure to market risks may also give an incentive to make efficient use of the respective market, thus limiting the indirect costs to society. The special characteristics of wind energy, however, put natural limits to the response of wind power plants to market prices and locational price signals and will increasingly influence electricity markets and grid infrastructure. These interdependencies should be recognised in the design of RES-E policies and market regulations. Renewables Electricity market Support policy...|$|R

40|$|The {{imbalance}} settlement design {{is the part}} of an <b>electricity</b> <b>balancing</b> <b>market</b> design that stimulates so-called Balance Responsible Parties (BRPs) to balance their electricity production and consumption portfolio and to stick to their energy schedules by penalizing any deviations from these schedules with an imbalance price. There are numerous {{imbalance settlement}} design options, each of which gives different incentives to BRPs. The aim of this work is to analyze the impact of the imbalance settlement design on BRP behaviour, and thereby on balancing market performance. For this purpose an agent based model has been built, in which the BRPs are the agents that decide autonomously in each round on their balancing strategy based on results in past rounds. Six alternative imbalance settlement designs are analyzed. We conclude from the analysis results that it is generally a better strategy for BRPs to opt for a long position rather than a short position, and to opt for a small imbalance rather than a large one. Furthermore, different imbalance settlement designs will lead to different but still similar results, because of the balancing market equilibrium that emerges {{as a result of the}} dynamic feedback loop between BRP behaviour and balancing market outcomes. An exception is formed by two-price settlement, which leads to much higher imbalance costs. Finally, it was found that the imbalance costs for large BRPs are relatively higher, and that the choice of imbalance settlement design has a greater impact on the behaviour of small BRPs.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{agent-based}} {{model that}} combines both spot and <b>balancing</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>markets.</b> From this model, we develop a multi-agent simulation {{to study the}} integration of the consumers' flexibility into the system.

We show that such undesirable behavior is in fact systemic. Due to the existing structure of the wholesale market, the predicted demand that is used {{in the formation of the}} price is never realized since the flexible users will change their demand according to such established price. As the demand is never correctly predicted, the volume traded through the <b>balancing</b> <b>markets</b> increases, leading to higher overall costs. In this case, the system can sustain, and even benefit from, a small number of flexible users, but this solution can never upscale without increasing the total costs.

For AS, technical requirements are more challenging in terms of speed and accuracy when compared with traditional DR. Specifically, DR for AS is needed year-round and not just for peak hours [15]. Different works have been presented in the past in order to evaluate DR for AS in different sectors. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has carried out a lot of research about DR for AS under the framework of smart grid and verified a series of power loads which have the ability to provide AS by experiment and demonstration project, such as lighting, air conditioning, refrigeration, data center and water pumping, etc [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. Reference [22] examined the characteristics of cement plants and their ability to shed or shift load to participate in DR. Reference [23] identified that six hours of load shifting could be achieved without adversely affecting production at a South African cement plant. Reference [24, 25] investigated the available opportunities of one aluminum smelter factory in AS market and discussed the regulation service that electrolytic aluminum enterprises could provide.

For this purpose, the European electricity sector consists of several markets. Objective {{of this paper is}} to investigate distorted incentives that stem from loopholes in the market design which BRPs can use to undermine <b>electricity</b> <b>balancing</b> principles in favour of gaming opportunities between the domestic imbalance energy pricing and international wholesale markets. These incentives are evaluated using historical data from the Swiss power system which features a typical European imbalance pricing mechanism.

The major loophole arises from the interdependence between cross-border trading and national imbalance energy pricing.

The proposed technique is based on mixed integer linear programming, so that a power system network is represented by a simplified DC power flow. Market participants' offers and bids are also represented by linear models. Results show that applications of FACTS devices can significantly reduce costs of congestion re-dispatch...|$|R
