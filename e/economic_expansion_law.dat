At that time, Argentina received {{some of the highest}} levels of foreign investment in Latin America. In the midst of this <b>economic</b> <b>expansion,</b> the <b>Law</b> 1420 of Common Education of 1884 guaranteed universal, free, non-religious education to all children. This and other government policies were strongly opposed by the Roman Catholic Church in Argentina, causing the Holy See to break off diplomatic relations with the country for several years and setting the stage for decades of continued Church-state strain.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of {{aggregate}} demand elasticity for the balance of trade when <b>economic</b> <b>expansion</b> occurs. Our conclusions are two. First, when an <b>economic</b> <b>expansion</b> results from an increase of aggregate demand, the balance of trade deficit is larger the less elastic is aggregate demand {{with respect to the}} general price level. Second, when an <b>economic</b> <b>expansion</b> happens from an increase of short-run aggregate supply, the price level elasticity of aggregate demand determines both the direction of change of the balance of trade {{and the size of the}} resulting deficit or surplus. We show here that a relatively elastic aggregate demand can result in a balance of trade deficit while a relatively inelastic aggregate demand can yield a balance of trade surplus...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a simple form of expansion history of Universe {{referred to as}} the hybrid <b>expansion</b> <b>law</b> - a product of power-law and exponential type of functions. The ansatz by construction mimics the power-law and de Sitter cosmologies as special cases but also provides an elegant description of the transition from deceleration to cosmic acceleration. We point out the Brans-Dicke realization of the cosmic history under consideration. We construct potentials for quintessence, phantom and tachyon fields, which can give rise to the hybrid <b>expansion</b> <b>law</b> in general relativity. We investigate observational constraints on the model with hybrid <b>expansion</b> <b>law</b> applied to late time acceleration as well as to early universe a la nucleosynthesis.
