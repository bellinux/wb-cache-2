5|$|After the 1848 {{finding of}} gold in the Sierra Nevada and {{dramatic}} gains in new wealth from it, other men {{became interested in the}} potential <b>for</b> <b>gold</b> mining in the Black Hills. In 1874, Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer led a military expedition from Fort Abraham Lincoln near Bismarck, to explore the Black Hills <b>for</b> <b>gold</b> and to determine a suitable location for a military fort in the Hills. Custer's announcement {{of gold in}} the Black Hills triggered the Black Hills Gold Rush. Tensions increased between the Lakota and whites seeking to move into the Black Hills.|$|E

5|$|The poem is a lyrical {{description}} {{of the life of}} a tribe he was living with along the Amazon river. While it has echoes of Tennyson in the rhymes and rhythms the poem itself is not overly Romantic, serving more as a tool to set the scene and then draw contrast between {{the lives of the people}} living here and those in England. The poem is a comment on savagery and greed, making the point that some in England were more 'savage' than those on the Amazon, either by a greed <b>for</b> <b>gold</b> or by their greed <b>for</b> <b>gold</b> driving others into poverty.|$|E

5|$|As part of {{the first}} {{amendment}} to its articles of agreement in 1969, the IMF developed a new reserve instrument called special drawing rights (SDRs), which could be held by central banks and exchanged among themselves and the Fund as an alternative to gold. SDRs entered service in 1970 originally as units of a market basket of sixteen major vehicle currencies of countries whose share of total world exports exceeded 1%. The basket's composition changed over time and presently consists of the U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese yen, Chinese yuan, and British pound. Beyond holding them as reserves, nations can denominate transactions among themselves and the Fund in SDRs, although the instrument is not a vehicle for trade. In international transactions, the currency basket's portfolio characteristic affords greater stability against the uncertainties inherent with free floating exchange rates. Special drawing rights were originally equivalent to a specified amount of gold, but were not directly redeemable <b>for</b> <b>gold</b> and instead served as a surrogate in obtaining other currencies that could be exchanged <b>for</b> <b>gold.</b> The Fund initially issued 9.5 billion XDR from 1970 to 1972.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1860s, when {{settlers}} began exploring <b>for</b> <b>gold</b> in the area, the Yavapai occupied an area {{of approximately}} 20,000mi² (51800km²) bordering the San Francisco Peaks to the north, the Pinaleno Mountains and Mazatzal Mountains to the southeast, and the Colorado River to the west, and almost to the Gila River and the Salt River to the south.|$|E

5|$|In {{the most}} complex placer mining, groups of prospectors would divert the water from an entire river into a sluice {{alongside}} the river, and then dig <b>for</b> <b>gold</b> in the newly exposed river bottom. Modern estimates by the U.S. Geological Survey are that some 12 million ounces (370t) of gold were removed {{in the first five}} years of the Gold Rush (worth over US$16billion at December 2010 prices).|$|E
5|$|Knowledge of {{the gold}} find seems to have {{remained}} largely within Mexican territory. John Sutter, who sided with Gov. Manuel Micheltorena during the governor's power struggle with former Gov. Alvarado, was imprisoned after the californio insurrectionists won the Battle of Providencia in 1845. After his release, he headed north through Placerita Canyon, saw the mining operation, and was determined to search <b>for</b> <b>gold</b> near where he later established Sutter's Fort; the latter in Mexican territory.|$|E

5|$|The Chimariko also {{suffered}} heavily when European prospectors entered {{the region in}} the 19th century searching <b>for</b> <b>gold.</b> After clashing with the Europeans, many members of the tribe were dispersed to Shasta territory or killed. Some returned to the Trinity River in the late 19th century, after the gold seekers had left. People of Chimariko ancestry continue to live in the region, although the tribe functionally no longer exists.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} the {{southern}} carmine bee-eater in Zimbabwe showed that it was affected by deliberate interference and persecution and loss of woodlands, and that nesting sites are lost though poor water management leading to river bank damage, dam construction and panning <b>for</b> <b>gold.</b> Colonies are becoming concentrated into the national parks and the Zambezi Valley. The well-studied European bee-eater is trapped and shot on migration in countries bordering the Mediterranean, an estimated 4,000–6,000 annually being killed in Cyprus alone, but with a global population of between 170,000 and 550,000 pairs even losses on that scale make little overall impact.|$|E
