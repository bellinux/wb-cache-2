5|$|Its use {{in hunting}} was varied, and the breed was useful both {{on land and}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b> In particular, it became {{successful}} in America and towards {{the beginning of the}} 20th century were popular in the area around Boston. They were described by the Spaniel Club of America as being as good <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> as the Chesapeake Bay Retriever.|$|E
5|$|A common {{parasite}} of bowfin is {{the anchor}} worm (Lernaea). These small crustaceans infest {{the skin and}} bases of fins, with consequences ranging from slowed growth to death. The mollusk Megalonaias gigantea lays eggs in the bowfin gills, that are then externally fertilized by sperm passing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> flow. The small glochidia larvae then hatch and develop in the gill tubes.|$|E
50|$|The total {{concentration}} of phenols <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> of Fishing Creek near Bloomsburg has been measured once, on November 9, 2004. The concentration {{was less than}} five micrograms per liter. The total {{concentration of}} chlortetracycline and oxytetracycline <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> of Fishing Creek near Bloomsburg between 2002 and 2012 have also both been measured several times. The concentrations of both compounds was always less than 0.01 micrograms per liter. Sulfamethazine is another chemical whose concentration has been measured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> of Fishing Creek. Its concentration is always less than 5 nanograms per liter.|$|R

5|$|A jonline {{can also}} be used to tether the diver's {{equipment}} to the dive boat before or after the dive. This helps the diver to put on or take off the equipment while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> without drifting away from the boat. It is similar to a buddy line, which is used to tether two divers together during a dive.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{not known}} with {{certainty}} how the spores are dispersed, they may disperse passively <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> or a mature spore-containing fruit body may float on the water surface for dispersal. L.incarnatum is homothallic, a mode of reproduction commonly employed by marine fungi that may confer a competitive advantage in marine environments.|$|E
5|$|At Catawissa Creek's headwaters, the {{concentration}} of iron <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> is 0.34mg/L. Manganese's level of occurrence is 1.74mg/L. Aluminium's concentration is 3.2mg/L. Acidity makes up 34.5mg/L and alkalinity makes up 0.17mg/L.|$|E

5|$|At {{this time}} the {{abundance}} of invertebrates crawling around on land and near water, in moist soil and wet litter, offered a food supply. Some were even big enough to eat small tetrapods, but the land was free from dangers common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
5|$|At weddings {{the parents}} of the bride offer the couple a glass of water and a comb. The comb is dipped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> and run through the hair of both bride and groom. Rice is then showered on the couple, connoting plenty.|$|E
5|$|Barium occurs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> of the Black Creek watershed, {{typically}} at {{concentrations of}} less than 0.07 milligrams per liter. Beryllium is about as common, with a concentration {{of less than}} 0.06 milligrams per liter. Strontium is much more common, with a concentration of up to 4.4 milligrams per liter.|$|E
40|$|The wels catfi sh, {{also called}} sheatfi sh (Silurus glanis L.) is {{expanding}} very rapidly throughout the italian peninsula, {{compared to the}} fi rst case in Italy <b>in</b> 1937; <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> of <b>the</b> rivers represent a real threat to native fi sh populations. The main purpose is to report the presence of Silurus glanis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> of <b>the</b> basin of the river Volturno. Here we indicate a massive presence of young fi shes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> of <b>the</b> river Calore Irpino <b>in</b> <b>the</b> province of Avellino and Benevento, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> river Sabato <b>in</b> <b>the</b> province of Benevento (May 2014) ...|$|R
5|$|There {{are large}} {{quantities}} of dissolved iron and aluminum <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> of Mahanoy Creek. Additionally, there are trace amounts of various metals, including cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, and lead, sulfates, manganese, and beryllium. There are traces of numerous other metals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters,</b> but their concentrations conform to drinking water standards.|$|R
50|$|The maximum {{concentration}} of manganese <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> of Lower Little Swatara Creek 670 micrograms per liter, as of 1985. The median {{concentration of}} iron <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>waters</b> of <b>the</b> creek was 850 micrograms per liter as of 1985. The concentration of dissolved iron <b>in</b> <b>the</b> creek near Pine Grove was 85 micrograms per liter.|$|R
5|$|Because banded sea kraits {{spend much}} of their time on land, they are often {{encountered}} by humans. They are frequently found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> intake and exhaust pipes of boats. Banded sea kraits are also attracted to light and can be distracted by artificial sources of light, including hotels and other buildings, on coasts.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{dissolving}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> {{oxygen and}} other gases {{are trapped in}} a type of structure called a clathrate. In clathrate structures, gases are enclosed in an icy cage and look like packed snow. These structures form at the high-pressure depths of Lake Vostok and would become unstable if brought to the surface.|$|E

5|$|Divers {{with long}} {{decompression}} obligations may be decompressed inside gas filled hyperbaric chambers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> {{or at the}} surface, and in the extreme case, saturation divers are only decompressed {{at the end of}} a tour of duty that may be several weeks long.|$|E
5|$|Diving bells are {{required}} to carry an onboard supply of breathing gas for use in emergencies. The cylinders are mounted externally as there is insufficient space inside.

5|$|During a 2004 {{assessment}} of Texas waterways, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality found {{higher than normal}} levels of bacteria {{at the mouth of}} Carancahua Creek and alkaline pH levels, symptomatic of algal bloom.

5|$|Each {{year during}} the warmer months of September through December, male banded sea kraits gather on land and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> around gently sloping areas at high tide. Males prefer to mate with larger females because they produce larger and more offspring.|$|E
5|$|Except for {{a single}} genus, all Hydrophiinae species are ovoviviparous; the young are born alive <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> where they live their entire lives. In some species, the young are quite large: up to half {{as long as the}} mother. The one {{exception}} is the genus Laticauda, which is oviparous; its five species all lay their eggs on land.|$|E
5|$|Hippopotamuses {{have been}} the {{subjects}} of various African folktales. According to a San story; when the Creator assigned each animal its place in nature, the hippos wanted to live <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water,</b> but were refused {{out of fear that}} they might eat all the fish. After begging and pleading, the hippos were finally allowed to live <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> on the conditions that they would eat grass instead of fish and would fling their dung {{so that it can be}} inspected for fish bones. In a Ndebele tale, the hippo originally had long, beautiful hair, but was set on fire by a jealous hare and had to jump into a nearby pool. The hippo lost most of his hair and was too embarrassed to leave the water.|$|E
