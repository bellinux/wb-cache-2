40|$|Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage" (CICH) {{was adopted}} in the 32 nd Session of the UNESCO General Conference in 2003. This {{convention}} {{makes it possible to}} list the ICH for safeguarding. Satisfying some procedural criteria is required in order to <b>inscribe</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> list. In other words, the outstanding value of heritage isn 2 ̆ 7 t evaluated unlike the World Heritage Convention. We, therefore, should think how to make the effective list without evaluating the heritage value. In this point, this is one of valuable researches for the future of this convention. This paper discusses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> consent of communities, {{which is one of the}} required processes to <b>inscribe</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> several lists of CICH. A few issues are led through the analysis of existing state of the consent of communities. In conclusion, I suggest that each state parties should be required more awareness about the consent of communities and the guidelines for "free, prior and informed consent" (FPIC) related to ICH should be developed in order to make it more effective...|$|R
5|$|Djedkare is well attested in sources {{contemporaneous}} {{with his}} reign. The tombs {{of many of}} his courtiers and family members have been discovered in Giza, Saqqara and Abusir. They give insights into the administrative reforms that Djedkare conducted during his reign and, in a few cases, even record letters that the king sent to his officials. These letters, <b>inscribed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> walls of tombs, typically present royal praises for the tomb owner.|$|E
5|$|Issues arose {{after the}} {{erection}} of the memorial concerning the names <b>inscribed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Cenotaph. The committee had identified 1,793 names of Southampton men, {{and a number}} of women, who had died during the war and these had been <b>inscribed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Cenotaph. After the unveiling of the monument various relatives approached the committee requesting that additional names be added; after a newspaper campaign in the Southern Daily Echo newspaper, Kimber agreed to this and 203 additional names were inscribed in 1921. Another name was added in 1922, bringing the total to 1,997. More controversy surrounded the exclusion of the Jewish war dead from the memorial. Jews in Southampton had donated to the committee on the understanding that the memorial would commemorate not only Christian casualties but Jewish ones as well: one in ten adult male Jews in Southampton died during the conflict, twice the proportion for Southampton as a whole. Following the final decision on the design of the Cenotaph, however, which featured a prominent Christian cross, Jewish names were predominantly excluded from the memorial and only one Jewish name was finally inscribed on it.|$|E
5|$|A fire on {{the night}} of 6November 1995 {{destroyed}} or damaged all the structures within the Rova complex shortly before it was due to be <b>inscribed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Although officially declared an accident, rumours persist that politically motivated arson may have been the actual cause of the fire. The chapel and tombs, as well as Besakana and Mahitsielafanjaka, have since been fully restored with bilateral government donations, state funds and grants from intergovernmental and private donors. Completion of the reconstruction of the Manjakamiadana exterior is estimated for 2012, while interior restoration work will continue until at least 2013. Once the building is fully restored, Manjakamiadana will serve as a museum showcasing royal artefacts saved from destruction in the fire.|$|E

5|$|A {{member of}} the {{military}} elite of the First French Empire and a recipient of the Grand Aigle de la Légion d'Honneur, Comte de Nansouty was a {{member of the}} Military Household of the Emperor as First Squire of the Emperor, and also held the position of Colonel-General of Dragoons. During the Bourbon Restoration, Louis XVIII awarded him additional honours and commands, including one in the Military Household of the King of France. Nansouty died in February 1815 and is buried at the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. His name is <b>inscribed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Arc de Triomphe and a street in the 14th arrondissement of Paris is named after him.|$|E
5|$|Altar Q is {{the most}} famous {{monument}} at Copán. It was dedicated by king Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat in AD776 and has {{each of the first}} 16 kings of the Copán dynasty carved around its side. Each figure is depicted seated on his name glyph. A hieroglyphic text is <b>inscribed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper surface, relating the founding of the dynasty in AD426427. On one side, it shows the dynastic founder K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' transferring power to Yax Pasaj. Interestingly, Tatiana Proskouriakoff first discovered the inscription on the West Side of Altar Q that tells us the date of the inauguration of Yax Pasaj. This portrayal of political succession tells us much about Early Classic Maya culture.|$|E
5|$|An inscribed block {{dating to}} the later Ramesside period (1292–1077 BC) and now in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin, was {{uncovered}} by Lepsius {{in a house in}} Abusir and shows Menkauhor enthroned beside four other deified kings of the Old Kingdom: the name of the first, partially lost, but probably Sneferu is then followed by Djedefre, Menkaure, Menkauhor and finally Neferkare. The owner of the tomb stands before the kings, in worship. Another relief {{dating to the}} same period shows a similar scene. It was <b>inscribed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lintel of the tomb chapel of Mahy buried in Saqqara North. Four deified kings of the Old Kingdom are shown, all of whom built their pyramids at Saqqara: Djoser, Teti, Userkaf and Menkauhor.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the program, after the Korean War, the CHA had little means to operate. Go Sangnyeol (고상렬), the administrator of CHA between 1961 and 1968 set out to search for intangible cultural properties {{on the basis of a}} series of articles written by Yae Yonghae (예용해) for Hankook Ilbo, as the reporter spent years in exploring the country and interviewing old masters of handicraft. The first items to be <b>inscribed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> intangible heritage list were thus taken from Yae's articles. Others were added based on the opinions of researchers and also included winners of the annual folk tradition competitions. The recommendation of local administrations was also sought.|$|E
5|$|Christodorus of Coptus, an Egyptian {{poet and}} writer wrote a lengthy (416 lines long) hexameter piece of poetry {{inspired}} by {{the glory of the}} statues housed within the halls of the Baths of Zeuxippus. This poem actually consisted of a number of short epigrams (six in total), each focusing on one or a small group of statues within the Baths, designed to combine to form one work. While {{it has been suggested that}} the epigrams of Christodorus of Coptus may actually have been <b>inscribed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> (bases) of the statues themselves, this is unlikely because of his use of the ekphrastic medium, and the presence of the past tense in the text.|$|E
5|$|Djedkare {{seems to}} have been held in high esteem during the Sixth Dynasty. For example, Merenre Nemtyemsaf I chose to place his pyramid complex close to that of Djedkare. In addition, the South Saqqara Stone, a royal annal dating to the reign of Merenre or of his {{successor}} Pepi II, records rich offerings being made to Djedkare on behalf of the king. An estimated 92% of the text <b>inscribed</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stone was lost when it was roughly polished to be reused as a sarcophagus lid, possibly in the late First Intermediate (c. 2160–2055 BC) to early Middle Kingdom period (c. 2055–1650 BC).|$|E
