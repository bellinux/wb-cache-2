50|$|An earmold (<b>ear</b> <b>mold</b> British {{ear mould}} or earmould) is a device worn {{inserted}} into the ear for sound conduction or ear protection. Earmolds are anatomically shaped and can be produced in different sizes for general use or specially cast from particular ear forms. Some users specify how hard or soft they want their mould to be, an audiologist can also suggest this. As a conductor, it improves sound transmission to eardrums. This is an essential feature to diminish feedback paths in hearing aids and assure better intelligibility in noisy-environment communication. The main goal in wearing earmolds is to attain better user comfort and efficiency. Earmolds (and their tubes) often turn yellow and stiff with age, and thus need replacement on a regular basis. The job of making earmoulds is very time-consuming and skilful; each one is made individually.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aim: Although for a {{child to}} {{maximize}} his or her mastery of language, hearing aids (HAs) must consistently be worn, and they must be functioning correctly many studies indicates some hearing- impaired children`s hearing aid do not work perfectly. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine types of defects in students' hearing aid (HA) in Tehran Exceptional Schools. Materials and method: In this cross-sectional analytic study defects in sixty â€“two HAs of 41 children were determined. All were the students of Exceptional Schools referred to Audiology Clinic, Faculty of Rehabilitation Medical Sciences University of Tehran. Functions of the HAs were first checked by a sthetoclips. Then the electroacoustic measurements performed to determine the values of maximum gain and maximum power output. The data were separately recorded in a questionnaire for each kind of the HAs. Results: Fifty-six percent of HAs functioned perfectly and forty-four percent were not. The most Frequet defects were 24 % and 20 % pertained to the battery and manual controls respectively. External components had more difficulties than internal components. Seventy percent of <b>ear</b> <b>molds</b> were damaged. There were significant differences between peak of FOG and MPO curves in the catalogue and electroacoustic measurements in 2 cc coupler. Conclusion: Most damaged parts of HAs in Tehran Exceptional students is related to the battery and controls which are external components of HAs. Because of high rate of dysfunctioning HAs and <b>ear</b> <b>molds</b> in this population in this survey, it is necessary to promote orientation and counseling level after fitting and to develop the quality of HAs and <b>ear</b> <b>molds</b> for Exceptional School students...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe fitting {{of hearing}} aids {{requires}} {{knowledge of the}} sound pressure generated at the ear drum. Traditionally, the sound pressure at the ear drum is estimated by the use of a model of an average ear canal (e. g. a coupler), but obviously, such a model cannot account for inter-individual differences. A better practice, but difficult, is the measurement at the ear drum with a probe-microphone. Alternatively, the sound pressure at the ear drum can be predicted by measurements away from the ear drum. Two methods, one of them based on the phase of the reflectance measured at the <b>ear</b> <b>mold,</b> and the other one based on minima of the sound pressure measured in the ear canal a few millimeters away from the <b>ear</b> <b>mold,</b> were investigated for the use with vented hearing aids.

An example of the first of these approaches is already on the market, namely transgenic maize expressing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxin, targeted to the European corn borer. Some Bt maize hybrids have the potential to reduce FB levels in field-harvested grain, presumably through reduced feeding of Bt-susceptible insects in ear tissues. However, improved <b>ear</b> <b>mold</b> resistance per se is still an important goal, as the plant will still be vulnerable to noninsect routes of entry to (italic) Fusarium.

40|$|The maize Hm 1 gene {{provides}} {{protection against}} a lethal leaf blight and <b>ear</b> <b>mold</b> disease caused by Cochliobolus carbonum race 1 (CCR 1). Although {{it was the}} first disease-resistance (DR) gene to be cloned, it remains a novelty because, instead of participating in the plant recognition and response system as most DR genes do, Hm 1 disarms the pathogen directly. It does so by encoding an NADPH-dependent reductase, whose function is to inactivate Helminthosporium carbonum (HC) toxin, an epoxide-containing cyclic tetrapeptide, which the pathogen produces as a key virulence factor to colonize maize. Although CCR 1 is strictly a pathogen of maize, orthologs of Hm 1 and the HC-toxin reductase activity are present in the grass family, suggesting an ancient and evolutionarily conserved role of this DR trait in plants. Here, we provide proof for such a role by demonstrating its involvement in nonhost resistance of barley to CCR 1. Barley leaves in which expression of the Hm 1 homologue was silenced became susceptible to infection by CCR 1, but only if the pathogen was able to produce HC toxin. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Hm 1 evolved exclusively and early in the grass lineage. Given the devastating ability of CCR 1 to kill maize, these findings imply that the evolution and/or geographical distribution of grasses may have been constrained if Hm 1 did not emerge...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The Vibrant Soundbridge (Symphonix Devices, San Jose, Calif) is a semi-implantable hearing device. The {{transducer}} {{is attached}} {{directly to the}} incus and is linked by telemetry to the externally worn audioprocessor. A major advantage of this semi-implantable setup, especially during its experimental phase, is that the audioprocessor can be updated. Recently, we replaced the previous 2 -channel analog audioprocessor in 14 patients with a 3 -channel digital device. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. Basic functions were measured, including gain {{as a function of}} input level and speech perception in quiet. PATIENTS: Patients (n = 14) had moderate to severe sensorineural hearing impairment (average hearing threshold at 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0, and 4. 0 kHz of 40 - to 76 -dB hearing level [HL]) and chronic external otitis, which contraindicated use of an <b>ear</b> <b>mold.</b> RESULTS: Gain of the 3 -channel audioprocessor for comfortable listening levels and for conversational levels varied from approximately 15 - to 30 -dB HL, suggesting that the device is suitable for patients with hearing loss of up to 60 - to 70 -dB HL. In 5 patients, identical measurements were performed using their conventional hearing aids. The other 9 patients did not use a conventional hearing device because of severe external otitis. On average, results obtained with the Vibrant Soundbridge were not as good as those obtained with the conventional device. Nevertheless, patients were satisfied with the Vibrant Soundbridge because they could use it all day without pain or itching.

Also, otoacoustic emissions show suppressive effects by contralateral stimulation (Guinan, 2006). To link the observations in humans more directly to the MOCR effects measured in animals, we investigate effects of contralateral stimulation in human volunteers with normal hearing using cochlear mass potentials: compound action potentials (CAP) and cochlear microphonic (CM). A minimally invasive transtympanic procedure was applied to record mass-potentials from the cochlear promontory or from the niche of the round window in humans. This involved a custom made <b>ear</b> <b>mold</b> to control acoustic stimulation (ER- 2 earphone, calibrated in-situ with ER- 7 microphone). To assess the MOCR, averaged CAP and CM responses to gated probe tones (100 ms) of 4 or 6 kHz with and without contralateral noise (continuous; levels 60 or 70 dB SPL; below threshold of the stapedius reflex) were extracted with a polarity alternating paradigm. In some experiments the probe was preceded by a forward noise masker (> 80 ms) to investigate the anti-masking effect, similar to that in Kawase and Liberman (1993). The measurements were divided into randomized blocks with intermittent contralateral noise. All subjects were screened for normal hearing (audiogram, tympanogram, threshold stapedius reflex) and psychophysically tested for the presence of a behavioral anti-masking effect (e. g. Strickland, 2008; Roverud and Strickland, 2010). In 3 subjects examined so far, we did not find a significant difference in CAP amplitudes between conditions with or without contralateral noise.

Localization cues can be altered through <b>ear</b> blocks, <b>ear</b> <b>molds,</b> electronic hearing devices and altered head-related transfer functions. Three main methods {{have been used to}} induce auditory space adaptation: sound exposure, training with feedback, and explicit training.

Also, studies that displaced the auditory space by altering cue values reported adaptations in perceived source position to compensate for such displacements. Auditory space adaptations can last for a few months even without further contact with the learned cues. In most studies, localization with the subjectâ€™s own unaltered cues remained intact despite the adaptation to a second set of cues. Generalization is observed from trained to untrained sound source positions, but there is mixed evidence regarding cross-frequency generalization.

Application of the tissue-molding device at 1-week after the childâ€™s birth proved most efficacious in achieving a successful correction, because, when the correction was initiated at 3-weeks from birth, the lessened malleability of the cartilage and tissues of the ear reduced the successful deformity correction rate to 50 per cent.|$|R
40|$|Background Based on {{physiological}} measurements in anesthetized animals (Guinan, 2011; Kawase and Liberman, 1993; BuÃ±o, 1978; Liberman, 1989; Warren and Liberman, 1989; Dolan and Nuttal, 1988) {{the medial}} olivocochlear reflex (MOCR) has been hypothesized {{to enhance the}} response to signals in noise. Several lines of evidence support such a role for the MOCR in humans. Psychophysical studies have shown effects on behavioral responses {{that are consistent with}} MOCR involvement. In our previous study in humans we did not observe a significant effect of contralateral simulation on cochlear mass potentials (compound action potentials (CAP) and cochlear microphonic (CM) at 4 kHz, but a preliminary measurement at 800 Hz indicated some effect on the neurophonic (NP). In this study we focus on low frequencies and assess electrophysiological and psychophysical effects in the same subjects. Methods Psychophysical experiments were conducted to measure the effects of contralateral noise on threshold for short, low- (800 Hz) and high- (4 kHz) frequency tones. Electrophysiological experiments were performed on the same subjects using a minimally invasive transtympanic procedure to extract averaged mass-potentials of short tones from the cochlear promontory or the niche of the round window. This involved a custom made <b>ear</b> <b>mold</b> to control acoustic stimulation (ER- 2 earphone, calibrated in-situ with ER- 7 microphone). Averaged mass responses (CAP, CM, NP) to tones with and without contralateral noise (below stapedius reflex) were extracted using paradigms based on polarity alternation and forward masking. All subjects were audiometrically normal (audiogram, tympanogram, reflex threshold). Results Psychophysics: All subjects (n= 9) showed an increase in behavioral threshold at 800 Hz with contralateral noise. The average threshold increase with contralateral level for the population was ~ 0. 14 dB/dB (50 - 80 dB SPL). At 65 dB SPL, the increase at 800 Hz was 3. 2 dB, which was much larger than at 4 kHz (1 dB; n= 6; one outlier excluded). Electrophysiology: Most of the effects of contralateral noiseon CAP and NP (1 st harmonic) at low frequencies were rather small and variable due to a limited signal-to-noise ratio. We analyzed the 2 nd harmonic of the sustained response in two subjects. We found a clear decreasing trend with contralateral level, with an average trend {{similar to that of the}} psychophysics. Conclusion In humans, we observed a progressive reduction with contralateral noise level for behavioral threshold and low frequency neurophonic (2 nd harmonic).

40|$|Frequency {{selectivity}} and neural phase-locking are {{two primary}} {{properties of the}} peripheral auditory system and are fundamental to hearing. These properties are reflected in neural signals as a place-rate and time code and are quantified by means of responses from single auditory nerve fibers (AN fibers). Because of practical issues, the limits of both properties are poorly characterized in humans and widely differing values are assumed {{in the interpretation of}} non-electrophysiological results. Recent otoacoustic and behavioral measurements suggest that frequency selectivity is higher in humans than in laboratory animals (Shera et al., 2002), but this is disputed based on comparisons of behavioral and electrophysiological measurements across species (Ruggero and Temchin, 2005). Neural phase-locking declines with frequency and becomes undetectable at an upper frequency limit which differs between species. Some studies suggest that phase-locking in human extends to much higher frequencies than that found in common laboratory animals such as cat. In this thesis we investigate the use of mass potentials to electrophysiologically quantify these properties in humans. A minimally invasive transtympanic protocol was developed to record stimulus-evoked mass-potentials from the cochlear promontory or from the niche of the round window in monkey (macaque) and human. This involved a custom made <b>ear</b> <b>mold</b> with openings for the transtympanic needle electrode and for acoustic stimulation (ER- 2 earphone, in situ calibrated with an ER- 7 microphone). To obtain frequency selectivity a notched-noise forward masking paradigm (Oxenham and Shera, 2003) was combined with the recording of compound action potentials (CAP). For neural phase-locking, we developed a method based on forward masking to disambiguate phase-locked contributions of receptor and neural origin (neurophonic). Both methods were first developed, assessed and validated at the round window in cat and thereafter applied in monkey and human. Frequency selectivity. We found that the empirical method that was first developed and assessed in cat was a suitable means to examine frequency tuning for a number of reasons. a) Masking of CAP responses behaved as expected from the physiology of single AN-fibers. b) Masking tuning curves were equivalent to tuning curve of single AN-fibers. c) The sharpness of masking tuning curves, quantified as a Q 10 -factor, closely followed the lower boundary of single AN-fibers and was only slightly higher at high frequencies. CAP-tuning was dependent on probe level consistent with cochlear physiology. The CAP responses behaved similar in human and monkey, but the responses and signal-to-noise ratios were much smaller and therefore higher stimulus levels (> 30 dB) were needed in human and monkey. We found that CAP tuning in human was on average 1. 6 times sharper than in cat and chinchilla and 1. 35 times sharper than in monkey (macaque). Neural phase-locking. We found that potentials near the round window have a considerable neural phase-lockedcontribution that can be isolated and quantified with the present method. Moreover, the neural component was in many ways similar to that measured on the auditory nerve. The only noteworthy differences with the latter were a typically larger magnitude and a smaller time lag for the neural component at the round window. The frequency limit obtained in cat was 4. 7 kHz, which is very similar to the limit reported for individual AN-fibers (~ 5 kHz). We found in many respects similarities between the measurements in human, monkey and those at the round window in cat, with similar temporal and spectral properties. The most notable difference in human and monkey compared to cat was a much smaller magnitude (- 30 dB) and also signal-to-noise(floor) ratio (- 20 dB) for the neurophonic. The upper detectable frequency limits of neural phase-locking obtained from stimulus evoked potentials was 3. 3 kHz in human and 4. 0 kHz in monkey (macaque). Frequency selectivity and neural phase-locking can be characterized from mass potentials with a minimally invasive technique from awake, normal hearing subjects. We found evidence that a) humans have sharper frequency tuning than commonly studied animals, consistent with previous reports (Shera et al., 2002; Oxenham and Shera, 2003) and; b) humans have an upper frequency limit of phase-locking that is not higher than in cat (5 kHz), and likely is somewhat lower.

VÃ¡rias pesquisas tÃªm sido {{realizadas}} com usuÃ¡rios de prÃ³teses auditivas, entretanto nÃ£o foram encontrados na literatura especializada estudos relacionados com usuÃ¡rios adaptados via Sistema Ãšnico de SaÃºde. Assim sendo, este estudo teve como objetivos: verificar as dificuldades relacionadas ao uso e manuseio de pilhas e moldes auriculares e Ã s caracterÃ­sticas da amplificaÃ§Ã£o neste grupo de estudo; e comparar os resultados da protetizaÃ§Ã£o a partir de questionÃ¡rios de auto-avaliaÃ§Ã£o em pacientes com e sem queixas relacionadas Ã s caracterÃ­sticas da amplificaÃ§Ã£o. Deste modo, o estudo constituiu-se de portadores de perdas auditivas bilaterais simÃ©tricas, neurossensoriais ou mistas, de graus moderado a moderadamente severo, entre 12 e 77 anos de idade, todos usuÃ¡rios de prÃ³teses auditivas com rocessamento do sinal digital ou analÃ³gico programÃ¡vel via computador por um perÃ­odo mÃ­nimo de trÃªs meses. Inicialmente, foi realizada uma entrevista com tÃ³picos relacionados Ã  experiÃªncia e ao uso e manuseio das pilhas, moldes e prÃ³teses auditivas nos 31 indivÃ­duos participantes do estudo. ApÃ³s, foram aplicados em 25 indivÃ­duos, os questionÃ¡rios de auto-avaliaÃ§Ã£o HHIE-S (Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly Screening Version) ou HHIA (Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adult) e APHAB (Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit), os quais permitiram verificar as dificuldades experimentadas nas situaÃ§Ãµes de comunicaÃ§Ã£o em atividades diÃ¡rias nos indivÃ­duos sem (Grupo 1) e com queixas relacionados Ã s caracterÃ­sticas da amplificaÃ§Ã£o (Grupo 2). Dos 31 indivÃ­duos entrevistados, 21 usuÃ¡rios apresentaram algum tipo de queixa relacionado ao funcionamento das prÃ³teses auditivas. JÃ¡ em relaÃ§Ã£o aos questionÃ¡rios de auto-avaliaÃ§Ã£o, aplicados em 25 deles, nÃ£o se encontrou diferenÃ§a estatisticamente significante entre os grupos estudados em relaÃ§Ã£o aos questionÃ¡rios HHIE-S e HHIA, e quanto ao APHAB constatou-se diferenÃ§a estatisticamente significante apenas em situaÃ§Ãµes favorÃ¡veis de comunicaÃ§Ã£o, tendo o Grupo 1 obtido melhor benefÃ­cio. No HHIE-S e HHIA, o Ã­ndice percentual mÃ©dio do handicap auditivo foi 34, 71 % para o Grupo 1 e 45, 82 % para o Grupo 2, indicando uma maior percepÃ§Ã£o do handicap auditivo pelo grupo com queixas. Encontraram-se valores de benefÃ­cio no APHAB para o Grupo 1 de 68, 62 % (FC), 37, 12 % (RA), 48, 38 % (RV) e - 9, 25 % (AS) e no Grupo 2, verificou-se Ã­ndices de 39, 59 % (FC), 38, 12 % (RA), 39, 88 % (RV) e - 28, 18 % (AS), evidenciando uma reduÃ§Ã£o significativa da incapacidade auditiva com o uso das prÃ³teses em situaÃ§Ãµes favorÃ¡veis de comunicaÃ§Ã£o (FC), em ambientes reverberantes (RV) e na presenÃ§a de ruÃ­do ambiental (RA) para ambos os grupos. Em situaÃ§Ãµes negativas de percepÃ§Ã£o dos sons ambientais, o desempenho com o uso das prÃ³teses auditivas foi pior para ambos os grupos, confirmado pelos Ã­ndices negativos de benefÃ­cio na sub-escala AS. Ao tÃ©rmino deste estudo, a apreciaÃ§Ã£o crÃ­tica dos resultados permitiu concluir que 12, 90 %, 58, 06 % e 67, 74 % dos indivÃ­duos entrevistados (N= 31) apresentaram dificuldades relacionadas Ã s pilhas, aos moldes ou cÃ¡psulas auriculares, e Ã s caracterÃ­sticas da amplificaÃ§Ã£o, respectivamente; e diferenÃ§as significantes entre os grupos estudados (N= 25) nos protocolos HHIE-S e HHIA, bem como no APHAB nÃ£o foram encontradas, exceto na sub-escala facilidade de comunicaÃ§Ã£o, onde o Grupo 1 (sem queixas) obteve melhor benefÃ­cio. According to MinistÃ©rio da SaÃºde {{is there}} {{the necessity to}} survey of the Country situation {{in relation to the}} hearing impairment, between the many aspects it is the hearing aid supply and the results after the act of receiving it, what it would make possible an improvement of the actions planning in Auditory Health Attention. Some research have been carried through with hearing aid users, meantime in the specialized literature, studies related with fitted users saw in the Sistema Ãšnico de SaÃºde, had not been found. Thus being, this study has like aims: to verify the difficulties related to the use and battery manipulation and <b>ear</b> <b>molds</b> and to the characteristics of the amplification in this group of study; and to compare the intervention results from self-assessment questionnaires in patients with and without related complaints with the characteristics of the amplification. In this way, the study consisted of individuals with symmetrical bilaterally hearing losses, sensorineural or mixed, from moderate to moderately severe degrees, between 12 and 77 years age, all hearing aid users of digital or hibrid for a minimum period of three months. Initially, it was carried through an interview with topics related to the experience and the use and battery manipulation, <b>ear</b> <b>molds</b> and hearing aids in the 31 individuals of the study. After, they had been applied in 25 individuals, the evaluations with self-assessment questionnaires HHIE-S (Hearing Handicap Inventory will be the Elderly Screening Version) or HHIA (Hearing Handicap Inventory will be Adult) and APHAB (Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit), which had allowed to verify the difficulties tried in the daily life communication situations in individuals without (Group 1) and with complaints related to the amplification characteristics (Group 2). Of the 31 interviewed individuals, 21 users had presented some kind of complaint related to hearing aids characteristics. Already in relation to the evaluations with self-assessment qestionnaires, applied in 25 of them, there was not found significant difference statistical among the studied groups in relation to questionnaires HHIE-S and HHIA, and about the APHAB significant difference statistical only in communication favorable situations of was evidenced, having Group 1 gotten benefit better. In HHIE-S and HHIA, the means values of hearing handicap was 34, 71 % for Group 1 and 45, 82 % for Group 2, indicating a bigger perception for the group with complaints. The values of benefit in the APHAB for Group 1 was 68, 62 % (FC), 37, 12 % (RA), 48, 38 (RV) and - 9, 25 (AS) and in Group 2, it verified 39, 59 % (FC), 38, 12 % (RA), 39, 88 % (RV) and - 28, 18 % (AS), evidencing a significant reduction of the hearing disabilities {{with the use of the}} hearing aids in communication favorable situations (FC), in reverberant environments (RV) and in the ambient noise presence (RA) for both groups. In negative situations of perception of the ambient sounds (AS), the performance with the use of the hearing aid was worse for both groups, confirmed for the negative values of benefit. Finnaly, the critical appreciation of the results allowed to conclude that 12. 90 %, 58, 06 % and 67, 74 % of the interviewed individuals (N= 31) had presented difficulties related to the battery, to the <b>ear</b> <b>molds</b> or capsules and to the amplification characteristics, respectively; and significant differences between the groups studied (N= 25) in the HHIE-S and HHIA protocols, as well as in the APHAB had not been found, except in sub-scale favorable communication situations, where Group 1 (without complaints) got benefit better...|$|R
