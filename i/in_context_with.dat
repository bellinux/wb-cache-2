The same year saw the publication of her Animal Ethics <b>in</b> <b>Context</b> <b>with</b> Columbia University Press. Among reviews of this book were pieces by Bernard Rollin in Anthrozoös, Jason Zinser in The Quarterly Review of Biology, J. M. Dieterle in Environmental Ethics, Scott D. Wilson in Ethics and Daniel A. Dombrowski in the Journal of Animal Ethics. She has subsequently published papers {{on the theme of}} assisting animals in the wild—ideas discussed in her Animal Ethics in Context—in animal-focussed journals, prompting commentary from Joel MacClellan, Gordon Burghart, and Catia Faria.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the activists}} {{did not succeed}} in saving the theater, Fields {{captured}} their tumultuous efforts on film and this resulted in two films: Saving The Indian Hills and footage that later became the core of Preserve Me A Seat. The later film enlarges the focus of Saving The Indian Hills to the entire United States. It presents the story of the Indian Hills Theater Preservation Society, the Omaha group that formed to save the theater, <b>in</b> <b>context</b> <b>with</b> the companion stories of similar groups that formed in other cities with the intention of saving their own theater palaces from the wrecking ball. Because of the controversy surrounding its Indian Hills Theater elements, the film's premier faced long delays while litigation got resolved. The world premiere occurred in Grand Island, NE Nebraska. After the feature a lively panel discussion occurred featuring the film-makers and theater developer, Paul Warshauer. The common thread of the theater preservation efforts within Preserve Me A Seat is their lack of success.|$|E

500|$|The new Mary Rose Museum was {{designed}} by architects Wilkinson Eyre, Perkins+Will and built by construction firm Warings. The construction has been challenging because the museum has been built over the ship in the dry dock which is a listed monument.

500|$|In 1946, Salvador Toscano {{challenged}} the attribution of shaft tomb artifacts to the Purépechans, {{a challenge that}} was echoed in 1957 by Miguel Covarrubias who firmly declared that Purépecha culture appeared only [...] "after the 10th century". [...] Toscano's and Covarrubias's views were later upheld by radiocarbon dating of plundered shaft tombs' charcoal and other organic remains salvaged in the 1960s by Diego Delgado and Peter Furst. [...] As the result of these excavations and his ethnological investigations of the modern-day indigenous Huichol and Cora peoples of Nayarit, Furst proposed that the artifacts were not only mere representations of ancient peoples, but also contained deeper significance. [...] The model houses, for example, showed the living dwelling <b>in</b> <b>context</b> <b>with</b> the dead – a miniature cosmogram – and the horned warriors (as discussed above) were shaman battling mystical forces.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers echoed {{that while}} the mission served as {{political}} commentary {{on the use of}} torture by the United States government, its use of torture was in poor taste. IGN's Keza MacDonald felt the torture sequence [...] "pushed the boundaries of taste" [...] and Polygons Chris Plante commented: [...] "The script plays it for laughs. I felt nauseated". Carolyn Petit of GameSpot felt that placing the torture scene <b>in</b> <b>context</b> <b>with</b> the monologue created a hypocrisy in the mission's function as a commentary device. In an editorial, Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer discussed whether the political commentary was overshadowed by the violent content and compared the mission to s [...] "No Russian" [...] controversy. He said that the close-up camera and quick time events accentuated the sequence's impact beyond the violence depicted in previous Grand Theft Auto games. Summarising its function as [...] "flawed", he considered the sequence lacking enough context to justify its violence.|$|E

500|$|Music critics universally {{criticized the}} video {{because of the}} limited amount of {{clothing}} Hilson wore in it. In an interview with gossip hound Perez Hilton, Hilson defended the clip, calling the video [...] "racy" [...] but {{in line with the}} perspective of her album: [...] "If you put it <b>in</b> <b>context</b> <b>with</b> my album, my album is called No Boys Allowed but really it means no bullshit allowed.

Hall elaborated that: [...] "There are a trilogy of songs and messages that go together on the album. , “Glorious Day,” and “To Know You.” [...] reminds me to be more intentional about what I do. I {{may not be able to}} get on a plane and fly to China and give out Bibles and preach the gospel, but how can I witness to my co-workers and my friends and my family." [...] The portion of the chorus that says [...] "like voices in the wilderness we're crying out" [...] is a reference to John the Baptist; Hall said that one of his favorite characters in the New Testament was John the Baptist, and commented that [...] "he [...] was so black and white. This is wrong, and this is right. And he was speaking into a grey world, saying black and white things, and it cost him his life". He elaborated on that, commenting that: [...] "Until the whole world hears are the lines and the things that John the Baptist said into a culture that did not want to hear it. And we've got to be in a place in our walk with Jesus that he's filled us to where we step into something that's unpopular and we can speak the truth, but that we can also speak it in love. We've got to live in such a way that I have the purpose that John had".|$|E

40|$|Context-Specific Priming Effects Page 2 Recent {{research}} suggests that processing of irrelevant information can be modulated in a rapid online fashion by contextual information in the task environment depending on the usefulness of that information <b>in</b> different <b>contexts.</b> Congruency effects evoked by irrelevant stimulus attributes are smaller <b>in</b> <b>contexts</b> <b>with</b> high proportions of incongruent trials and larger <b>in</b> <b>contexts</b> <b>with</b> high proportions of congruent trials (e. g., Corballis & Gratton, 2003; Lehle & Hübner, 2008). The present study investigates these <b>context</b> adaptation effects <b>in</b> a masked priming paradigm. Context-specific adaptation effects transfer to stimulus identities that are equiprobale in all contexts- an observation that renders explanations in terms of event-learning processes unlikely. Yet, context-specific effects vanished when the irrelevant information remained unconscious. The results suggest that context-specific adaptation of congruency effects reflect cognitive control operations that alte...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The ideomotor {{principle}} (IMP) {{claims that}} bidirectional associations between actions and their contingent effects are acquired so that voluntary actions are accessed by {{the anticipation of}} intended effects. Until now, evidence for the IMP exists only for stable action-effect relations. The present paper explores whether the IMP also holds true for the initiation of actions for which no unconditional contingent action-effect rela-tions exist. Participants responded with left and right key presses <b>in</b> two different <b>contexts.</b> They selected the responses according to the vertical (context A) or hori-zontal (context B) position of a target. Responses were followed by short/fast movements of the target in con-text A and comparatively long/slow movements <b>in</b> <b>context</b> B. Consequently, each response produced short and long effects equally often <b>in</b> both <b>contexts.</b> Never-theless, RTs decreased <b>in</b> <b>contexts</b> <b>with</b> short effects and increased <b>in</b> <b>contexts</b> <b>with</b> long effects. Data confirm that action-effect associations were acquired context-specifi-cally and that the same actions were accessed by differ-ent effect anticipations...|$|R

Pentecostals place the gifts of the Spirit <b>in</b> <b>context</b> <b>with</b> the fruit of the Spirit. The fruit of the Spirit {{is the result of the}} new birth and continuing to abide in Christ. It is by the fruit exhibited that spiritual character is assessed. Spiritual gifts are received as a result of the baptism with the Holy Spirit. As gifts freely given by the Holy Spirit, they cannot be earned or merited, and they are not appropriate criteria with which to evaluate one's spiritual life or maturity. Pentecostals see in the biblical writings of Paul an emphasis on having both character and power, exercising the gifts in love.|$|E
