5|$|Caribbean {{monk seals}} {{were found in}} warm temperate, {{subtropical}} and tropical waters of the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the west Atlantic Ocean. They probably preferred to <b>haul</b> <b>out</b> at sites (low sandy beaches above high tide) on isolated and secluded atolls and islands, but occasionally would visit the mainland coasts and deeper waters offshore. This species may have fed in shallow lagoons and reefs.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates the Enhydra lineage became {{isolated in the}} North Pacific approximately 2 Mya, giving rise to the now-extinct Enhydra macrodonta and the modern sea otter, Enhydra lutris. The sea otter evolved initially in northern Hokkaidō and Russia, and then spread east to the Aleutian Islands, mainland Alaska, and down the North American coast. In comparison to cetaceans, sirenians, and pinnipeds, which entered the water approximately 50, 40, and 20 Mya, respectively, the sea otter is a relative newcomer to a marine existence. In some respects, though, the sea otter is more fully adapted to water than pinnipeds, which must <b>haul</b> <b>out</b> on land or ice to give birth.|$|E
5|$|By 20:00, Scheer {{ordered the}} German line to {{complete}} a 180-degree turn eastward to disengage from the British fleet. The maneuver, conducted under heavy fire, caused disorganization in the German fleet. Kaiserin had come too close to Prinzregent Luitpold {{and was forced to}} <b>haul</b> <b>out</b> of line to starboard to avoid a collision. The latter vessel came up alongside Kaiserin at high speed. As a result, Kaiserin had to remain out of line and could not return to her assigned position. The turn reversed the order of the German line; Kaiserin was now the seventh ship {{from the rear of the}} German line. At around 23:30, the German fleet reorganized into the night cruising formation. Kaiserin was the eleventh ship, in the center of the 24-ship line.|$|E

Occasionally, Steller sea lions <b>haul</b> <b>out</b> on St. Paul, but usually take refuge in the rookery at Walrus Island, some 10 miles northeast of St. Paul.

Warspite came under intense fire from the approaching German battleships; Kaiser scored a hit on Warspite that damaged her steering gear and forced her to steam in a circle, out of control. After completing two full circles and sustaining 13 heavy hits, Warspite came back under control and rejoined the squadron. However, by 20:00 the steering gear had again failed, so the ship was forced {{to withdraw from the}} engagement.|$|E
500|$|Later in {{the evening}} of {{the first day of the}} battle, the hard-pressed battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group were being pursued by their British opponents. Pommern and the other {{so-called}} [...] "five-minute ships" [...] came to their aid by steaming in between the opposing battlecruiser squadrons. Pommern could not make out a target in the darkness, though several of her sisters could. Despite this, their shooting was ineffective. The British battlecruisers scored several hits on the German ships, including one on Pommern by a [...] shell fired by , forcing her to <b>haul</b> <b>out</b> of line.

500|$|At 3:10 on {{the morning}} of 1 June, Pommern was torpedoed by the British {{destroyer}} [...] At least one torpedo, and possibly a second, struck the ship, detonating one of the 17cm ammunition magazines. A tremendous explosion broke the ship in half. The stern capsized and remained afloat for at least 20minutes with her propellers jutting into the air. , the ship directly astern of Pommern, was forced to <b>haul</b> <b>out</b> of line to avoid the wreck. Pommerns entire crew of 839 officers and enlisted men were killed when the ship sank. She was the only battleship, pre-dreadnought or dreadnought, in either fleet to be sunk at Jutland; her loss, coupled with the vulnerabilities of the surviving pre-dreadnoughts, prompted Scheer to leave them behind during the sortie of 1819 August 1916.|$|E
500|$|The five ships {{participated in}} the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916 {{under the command of}} Admiral von Mauve, where they formed the Second Battle Squadron (the Squadron was {{completed}} by a sixth pre-Dreadnought, the Hessen of the [...] ). Towards the end of the fleet battle on the evening of 31 May, the five Deutschland-class ships came to the aid of the mauled battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group. The Deutschlands intervened and prevented the British battlecruisers under Admiral David Beatty from pursuing the German ships. In the darkness, the Germans had difficulty making out their targets and failed to score any hits; the British, however, managed to hit three of the Deutschlands. Pommern was forced briefly to <b>haul</b> <b>out</b> of line. During the night actions, Pommern was torpedoed. The torpedo detonated an ammunition magazine and destroyed the ship, killing all hands on board.

500|$|During {{the ferocious}} night {{fighting}} that occurred as the High Seas Fleet forced {{its way through}} the British rear, the IV Scouting Group encountered the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron at close range in the darkness. As the two squadrons closed on each other, the Germans illuminated [...] and [...] and concentrated their fire on the two ships. Stuttgart and [...] fired on Dublin. During this period, Dublin was hit by eight shells, probably all from Stuttgart, though these hits did not do serious damage. The two British ships were badly damaged and set on fire and forced to retreat, while the Germans also fell back in an attempt to bring the British closer to the battlecruisers [...] and [...] In the melee, the cruiser [...] was hit and sunk by a torpedo launched by Southampton; this forced Stuttgart to <b>haul</b> <b>out</b> of line to starboard. She then lost contact {{with the rest of the}} IV Scouting Group, so she fell in with the I Battle Squadron. She was present during a later encounter with British light forces around midnight. She remained concealed in the darkness and observed the I Battle Squadron dreadnoughts hammering several British destroyers.

500|$|The AO went {{bankrupt}} {{a few years}} later and was bought by another startup railroad, the Kansas City & Memphis Railroad (KC) in early 1911. It would build from Cave Springs, a few miles west of Rogers, through Fayetteville and towards Memphis, Tennessee. In 1912 the Ozark Land and Lumber Company began construction of a 5-mile extension east of Monte Ne from the White River to the Piney community and leased the line to the KC [...] The White River bridge consisted of 780 feet of trestle and 2,152foot steel spans, making it the longest railroad bridge in Benton County. This extension was used to <b>haul</b> <b>out</b> forestry products. The KC entered receivership in 1914, and in September of that year passenger service to Monte Ne ended. When the U.S. entered World War I in 1917, many railroads were seized by the United States government. The KC was not seized, and due to unfavorable rulings by the United States Railroad Administration and Arkansas Railroad Commission saw much of its revenue evaporate. In January 1918 Roscoe Hobbs, one of the court-appointed receivers of the KC, went to Washington, D.C. to provide testimony to the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce on the effects of these decisions on small railroads. As part of that testimony Hobbs reported 215 cars from the Rogers White Lime Company and 216 cars of pit props and railroad ties being hauled on the Monte Ne portion of the railway in 1917. Hobbs was unsuccessful in having the decisions reversed, and most portions of the KC were abandoned by October 1918. The Monte Ne portion was used until 1919. The White River bridge survived longer and was used for horse and foot traffic before becoming unsafe. The steel spans were scrapped during World War II.|$|E
