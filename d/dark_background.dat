5|$|The only quagga to {{have been}} photographed alive was a mare at the Zoological Society of London's Zoo. Five {{photographs}} of this specimen are known, taken between 1863 and 1870. On the basis of photographs and written descriptions, many observers suggest that the stripes on the quagga were light on a <b>dark</b> <b>background,</b> unlike other zebras. Reinhold Rau, pioneer of the Quagga Project, claimed {{that this is an}} optical illusion: that the base colour is a creamy white and that the stripes are thick and dark. Embryological evidence supports zebras being dark coloured with white as an addition.|$|E
5|$|The half-length {{portrait}} shows Maria Portinari (born Maria Maddalena Baroncelli in 1456) in a three-quarter view {{turned to}} the left. She has somewhat Nordic features, and is dressed in the high fashion then found {{at the apex of}} Flemish and Italian high society. She is placed against a flat, opaque, <b>dark</b> <b>background,</b> with her hands clasped in prayer. In Memling's early portraits the backgrounds tend to be plain, as was invariably the case in the work of Jan van Eyck and Roger van der Weyden, and favored within Burgundian court circles. In contrast, Memling's later portraits are set within rich interiors or against landscapes framed by columns, such as in his Portrait of Benedetto Portinari, a fact that has assisted in dating his work.|$|E
5|$|The {{single most}} major aspect of shell {{variation}} within the genus {{is the color}} patterning. In general, many arboreal snails are brightly colored, obvious examples being the bulimulid genera Drymaeus and Liguus, the cepolid Polymita, and the camaenid Papuina. However, Polymita, Liguus and Amphidromus are particularly noted for their color variations. The basic ground color of Amphidromus appears to be yellow, and this color is usually (except for Amphidromus entobaptus) confined to the surface layers of the shell, since worn specimens appear to be nearly devoid of color. In some species the background color is whitish, and a few have <b>dark</b> <b>background</b> colors. The apical whorls are pale, purple, brown, or black, and this sometimes varies within a population (as in A. quadrasi). A few species, for example A. schomburgki, have a deciduous green periostracum.|$|E

5|$|The {{video was}} quickly pulled after its release because it {{contained}} some technical errors. The clips {{of the people}} on Carey's television had their struggles captioned in dark text on a <b>dark</b> <b>background,</b> making it difficult to read. There were also continuity errors during the rainy balcony scene, as Carey's shirt would alternate between being soaking wet and dry. Consequently, a new music video was completed, which retained the clips of Carey's fans at the beginning but fixed the captions and replaced most of the interior shots of Carey with new footage. Carey, now in a new and more furnished apartment, does not go out into the rain but instead stays in her living room. She walks over to a large pair of windows aside a mural of large throw pillows and candles, singing and flailing her arms as she completes the song. As with the previous filming of the video, Carey's pain and sadness is resolved with a rainbow, shown {{at the end of the}} video.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no direct}} {{replacement}} to Hubble as an ultraviolet and visible light space telescope, because near-term space telescopes {{do not duplicate}} Hubble's wavelength coverage (near-ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths), instead concentrating on the farther infrared bands. These bands are preferred for studying high redshift and low-temperature objects, objects generally older and farther away in the universe. These wavelengths are also difficult or impossible to study from the ground, justifying {{the expense of a}} space-based telescope. Large ground-based telescopes can image some of the same wavelengths as Hubble, sometimes challenge HST in terms of resolution by using adaptive optics (AO), have much larger light-gathering power, and can be upgraded more easily, but cannot yet match Hubble's excellent resolution over a wide field of view with the very <b>dark</b> <b>background</b> of space.|$|E
5|$|The {{heart of}} the Fabry–Pérot {{interferometer}} {{is a pair of}} partially silvered glass optical flats spaced several millimeters to centimeters apart with the silvered surfaces facing each other. (Alternatively, a Fabry–Pérot etalon uses a transparent plate with two parallel reflecting surfaces.) As with the Fizeau interferometer, the flats are slightly beveled. In a typical system, illumination is provided by a diffuse source set at the focal plane of a collimating lens. A focusing lens produces what would be an inverted image of the source if the paired flats were not present; i.e. {{in the absence of the}} paired flats, all light emitted from point A passing through the optical system would be focused at point A'. In Fig.6, only one ray emitted from point A on the source is traced. As the ray passes through the paired flats, it is multiply reflected to produce multiple transmitted rays which are collected by the focusing lens and brought to point A' on the screen. The complete interference pattern takes the appearance of a set of concentric rings. The sharpness of the rings depends on the reflectivity of the flats. If the reflectivity is high, resulting in a high Q factor (i.e. high finesse), monochromatic light produces a set of narrow bright rings against a <b>dark</b> <b>background.</b> In Fig.6, the low-finesse image corresponds to a reflectivity of 0.04 (i.e. unsilvered surfaces) versus a reflectivity of 0.95 for the high-finesse image.|$|E

40|$|The role of {{cognitive}} {{sensitivity to light}} {{in the development of}} seasonal affective disorder (SAD, winter type) was studied by comparing 29 SAD patients during remission with 29 non-depressed controls matched by sex and age, and by relating measures for cognitive sensitivity of remitted SAD patients to the onset of a depressive episode during the following autumn/winter. To ensure that only cognitive processes were involved, the subjects were exposed to symbolic light. Thr;ee schematic drawings of ambiguous faces expressing different emotions were embedded in light or <b>dark</b> <b>backgrounds</b> for tl;is purpose. The subjects rated the various facial expressions with respect to the degree of elation-sadness, rejection-invitation, and activation-sleepiness. SAD patients saw larger differences in activation between faces embedded in light and <b>dark</b> <b>backgrounds</b> than controls, perceiving less activation in faces with <b>dark</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> Furthermore, the larger the difference that SAD patients saw in invitation between faces with light and <b>dark</b> <b>backgrounds,</b> the earlier they became depressed in the subsequent autumn/winter. Only the SAD patients who became depressed early (before December 21) differed from controls in the perception of invitation. Results are interpreted within the framework of psychological theories on the development of depression and suggest that altered cognitive sensitivity of SAD patients to light plays a {{role in the development of}} depressive episodes...|$|R

25|$|Birefringence is {{utilized}} in medical diagnostics. One powerful accessory used with optical microscopes {{is a pair}} of crossed polarizing filters. Light from the source is polarized in the X direction after passing through the first polarizer, but above the specimen is a polarizer (a so-called analyzer) oriented in the Y direction. Therefore, no light from the source will be accepted by the analyzer, and the field will appear dark. However areas of the sample possessing birefringence will generally couple some of the X-polarized light into the Y polarization; these areas will then appear bright against the <b>dark</b> <b>background.</b> Modifications to this basic principle can differentiate between positive and negative birefringence.|$|E

50|$|The Very Clever Pipe Game is a {{card game}} {{produced}} by Cheapass Games. It {{can be played}} by 2-4 people, or more in teams. Like other pipe games, the objective can be to create a closed circuit in pipes of your color by playing cards from your hand. When you accomplish this, {{you pick up the}} cards. Whoever has the most cards at the end wins. However, what makes this game unique (and thus, according to the maker, Very Clever) is that you can also choose to close off fields of light or <b>dark</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> If you have four players, for instance, each has a different goal: light pipes, <b>dark</b> pipes, light <b>backgrounds,</b> or <b>dark</b> <b>backgrounds.</b> With so many competing goals, the game becomes quite complicated.|$|R
25|$|The Dutch {{tradition}} was largely begun by Ambrosius Bosschaert (1573–1621), a Flemish-born flower painter who {{had settled in}} the north {{by the beginning of}} the period, and founded a dynasty. His brother-in-law Balthasar van der Ast (d. 1657) pioneered still lifes of shells, as well as painting flowers. These early works were relatively brightly lit, with the bouquets of flowers arranged in a relatively simple way. From the mid-century arrangements that can fairly be called Baroque, usually against a <b>dark</b> <b>background,</b> became more popular, exemplified by the works of Willem van Aelst (1627–1683). Painters from Leiden, The Hague, and Amsterdam particularly excelled in the genre.|$|E
25|$|These {{fish are}} often kept by aquarists {{as they are}} dutiful algae-eaters and smaller in adult size than the common plecos usually seen in petshops. Size is up to 15cm (male), 12cm (female), {{recommended}} temperature 23–27 degrees Celsius, lifespan up to 12 years. They are hardy animals, tolerant {{to a wide range}} of water conditions, breeding easily in captivity, compatible with most other freshwater fish, though typically mottled brown or black-and-grey spotted in color, other species are more exotic– spots of bright yellow on a <b>dark</b> <b>background</b> being a common patternation, albino variants are also common. The albino morph is not caused by exposure to light during development, it is a morph controlled by genetics.|$|E

Around her rests a thickly painted background of white chemise; set against this her naked flesh stands out for its solid form and the sumptuous application of paint. The paint used to describe her figure is richly nuanced, its broad brushstrokes and strong highlights impart a vibrant tactile quality to the body, rendering her presence palpable.|$|E

25|$|In the {{investigations}} on radiant heat in air {{it had been}} necessary to use air from which all traces of floating dust and other particulates had been removed. A very sensitive way to detect particulates is to bathe the air with intense light. The scattering of light by particulate impurities in air and other gases, and in liquids, is known today as the Tyndall Effect or Tyndall Scattering. In studying this scattering during the late 1860s Tyndall was a beneficiary of recent improvements in electric-powered lights. He also had the use of good light concentrators. He developed the nephelometer and similar instruments that show properties of aerosols and colloids through concentrated light beams against a <b>dark</b> <b>background</b> and are based on exploiting the Tyndall Effect. (When combined with microscopes, {{the result is the}} ultramicroscope, which was developed later by others).|$|E
25|$|The 83 × 67cm (33 × 26 in) {{painting}} shows a half-length {{portrait of}} the painter Édouard Manet. In this self-portrait as painter he depicted himself as a stylish Boulevardier {{in front of a}} <b>dark</b> <b>background.</b> The depicted wears a black top hat and a brown jacket, under which is a white shirt, of which only the collar can be seen. The neckline of the suit jacket covers a black silk tie which is affixed by a tie pin. In the right, only vaguely depicted hand he holds a long wooden brush with red paint on the tip; the left hand holds a painting palette with about three more brushes. No further accessories are shown. The figure is lit from the left by which the shadows beneath the left arm and the right half of the face are created. His pose is slightly turned to the right, so that the right half of the body is darker than the forward, left half. The painter's gaze is directed forwards at the viewer.|$|E
25|$|The {{optical effect}} of a TN device in the voltage-on state is far less {{dependent}} on variations in the device thickness than that in the voltage-off state. Because of this, TN displays with low information content and no backlighting are usually operated between crossed polarizers such that they appear bright with no voltage (the eye is much more sensitive to variations in the dark state than the bright state). As most of 2010-era LCDs are used in television sets, monitors and smartphones, they have high-resolution matrix arrays of pixels to display arbitrary images using backlighting with a <b>dark</b> <b>background.</b> When no image is displayed, different arrangements are used. For this purpose, TN LCDs are operated between parallel polarizers, whereas IPS LCDs feature crossed polarizers. In many applications IPS LCDs have replaced TN LCDs, in particular in smartphones such as iPhones. Both the liquid crystal material and the alignment layer material contain ionic compounds. If an electric field of one particular polarity is applied {{for a long period}} of time, this ionic material is attracted to the surfaces and degrades the device performance. This is avoided either by applying an alternating current or by reversing the polarity of the electric field as the device is addressed (the response of the liquid crystal layer is identical, regardless of the polarity of the applied field).|$|E
