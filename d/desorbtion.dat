40|$|The {{interaction}} between tin phthalocyanine (SnPc) and polycrystalline iron {{has been studied}} with XPS and synchrotron radiation excited XPS. After incremental annealing of a thin film of SnPc on a polycrystalline iron substrate, a low binding energy component of the Sn 3 d core level became increasingly abundant. This component is attributed to metallic tin, and thus, {{it is suggested that}} a substitution reaction has occurred. Quantitative analysis of the carbon and nitrogen core level intensities is consistent with such a substitution. The reaction is observable at room temperature, but is enhanced at elevated temperatures. It is also shown that after thermal <b>desorbtion</b> of the SnPc adlayer, the residual carbon component is significantly reduced relative to a thermally cleaned polycrystalline surface. © 2004 Elsevier B.

The attention is focused on the influence of storage time between the implantation stage and the annealing stage, since it is expected that even at low temperatures the phenomena taking part in the blistering and exfoliation process are active. Three different storage environments are selected: (1) liquid nitrogen, (2) room temperature and (3) 100 °C in air. The main result is that long time sample storage has the effect of decrease the exfoliation efficiency. Moreover, optimum conditions for exfoliation are met at storage time around 24 h at 100 °C, where the maximum fraction (1) of the sample surface (about 16 %) results exfoliated and (2) of He atoms (about 80 %) are desorbed.

40|$|Coal seam gas (CSG) {{exploration}} and development requires the abstraction of significant amounts of water. This is so because gas <b>desorbtion</b> in coal seams takes place only after aquifer pressure has been reduced by prolonged pumping of aquifer water. CSG waters have a specific geochemical signature which {{is a product of}} their formation process. These waters have high bicarbonate, high sodium, low calcium, low magnesium, and very low sulphate concentrations. Additionally, chloride concentrations may be high depending on the coal depositional environment. This particular signature is not only useful for exploration purposes, but it also highlights potential environmental issues that can arise as a consequence of CSG water disposal.

30|$|The {{nature of}} the binder used with the {{pigments}} remains somewhat elusive. In part, this reflects the need to remove a small sample for FTIR analysis, and to follow this with additional analytical techniques such as gas chromatography with mass spectroscopy (GCMS) or matrix assisted laser <b>desorbtion</b> ionization (MALDI) for definitive identification. FTIR analysis of {{a small number of}} samples from works spanning the 14 th to 17 th century (from Table  1, # 4, 10, 15, 19, 27, 31, 32, 33) indicated gum-based binder in all samples, with only the occasional presence of minor proteinaceous material.

40|$|Background: Though recent {{advancement}} in proteomics {{has provided a}} novel perspective on several distinct pathogenetic mechanisms leading to preterm birth (inflammation, bleeding), the etiology of most preterm births still remains elusive. We conducted a multidimensional proteomic analysis of the amniotic fluid to identify pathways related to preterm birth {{in the absence of}} inflammation or bleeding. Methodology/Principal Findings: A proteomic fingerprint was generated from fresh amniotic fluid using surface-enhanced laser <b>desorbtion</b> ionization time of flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectrometry in a total of 286 consecutive samples retrieved from women who presented with signs or symptoms of preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of the membranes. Inflammation and/or bleeding proteomic patterns were detected in 32 % (92 / 286) of the SELDI tracings. In the remaining tracings, a hierarchical algorithm was applied based on descriptors quantifying similarity/dissimilarity among proteomic fingerprints. This allowed identification of a novel profile (Q-profile) based on the presence of 5 SELDI peaks in the 10 – 12. 5 kDa mass area.

Fraunhofer IPM works on two different detection methods using mid-infrared absorption spectroscopy in combination with quantum cascade lasers (QCL). 1. stand-off detection for a spatial distance of several meters and 2. contactless extractive sampling for short distance applications. The extractive method {{is based on a}} hollow fiber that works as gas cell and optical waveguide for the QCL light. The samples are membranes contaminated with the explosives and real background. The low vapor pressure of TNT requires a thermal <b>desorbtion</b> to introduce gaseous TNT and TATP into the heated fiber. The advantage of the hollow fiber setup is the resulting small sample volume. This enables a fast gas exchange rate and fast detection in the second range. The presented measurement setup achieves a detection limit of around 58 ng TNT and 26 ng TATP for 1 m hollow fiber. TATP - an explosive with a very high vapor pressure in comparison to TNT or other explosives - shows potential for an adequate concentration in gas phase under normal ambient conditions and thus the possibility of an explosive detection using open path absorption of TATP at 8 μm wavelength. In order to lower the cross sensitivities or interferents with substances with an absorption in the wavelength range of the TATP absorption the probe volume is checked synchronously by a second QCL emitting beside the target absorption wavelength.

Getter material sintered to substrates {{can be used to}} add modular pumps to a system, and are activated at temperatures up to 450 °C or more through resistive heating of the substrate. The low-activationtemperature alloy of Ti-Zr-V in an approximately 1 : 1 : 1 ratio has been developed and shown to activate at the moderate temperature of a 250 °C bakeout, and is therefore appropriate for a coating on beampipes, where it can be activated during bakeout. A coated beampipe or chamber adds distributed pumping and can effectively eliminate net outgassing from the walls. Ti-Zr-V coatings with pump speeds up to 10 L/s/cm 2 are commercially available, deposited using DC magnetron sputtering to make the process commercially viable. We have been using a non-magnetron DC {{sputtering system}} to coat the 3 ” diameter beampipe leading from the CEBAF polarized electron guns to the beamline for the past 10 years.

Instrumentation has been designed for unattended continuous operation. Laboratory chemistries for the vapour generation of mercury, normally performed off-line in batch mode, have been adapted and optimised for continuous, flow-injection analysis for varying sample types and chemical forms of mercury. The system has typical analysis cycle of 7 minutes, a limit of detection of 10 pg ml ˉ¹ a linear range up to 100 µg ml ˉ¹ and has been applied in industrial environments for the continuous monitoring of mercury in incineration wastewater and sulphuric acid. The system was validated by on-site trials for periods of one week, during which time comparative off-line laboratory measurements showed good agreement. An automated system for monitoring mercury in natural gas streams has also been developed and validated by laboratory and on-site industrial trials. A heated pressure let-down system was designed in order to facilitate sampling of high-pressure gas streams without condensation of heavier fractions. The heated sampling line was interfaced with an automated system for trapping mercury, from variable volumes of gas, onto gold amalgamation traps, with subsequent <b>desorbtion</b> and analysis by AFS.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to present the design and {{development}} of a chemical vapor deposition reactor {{for the growth of}} high quality homoepitaxy silicon carbide films for electronic device applications. The work was performed in the Nanomaterials and Nanomanufacturing Research Center at the University of South Florida from 8 / 2001 - 5 / 2003. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is the technique of choice for SiC epitaxial growth. Epitaxial layers are the building blocks for use in various semiconductor device applications. This thesis reports on a SiC epitaxy process where a carrier gas (hydrogen) is saturated with reactive precursors (silane and propane) which are then delivered to a semiconductor substrate resting on a RF induction heated SiC coated graphite susceptor. Growth proceeds via a series of heterogeneous chemical reactions with several steps, including precursor adsorption, surface diffusion and <b>desorbtion</b> of volatile by-products. The design and development of a reactor to make this process controlled and repeatable can be accomplished using theoretical and empirical tools.

The fluorine-substituted metal distonic ion IFe+C 6 F 4 • was formed by rearrangement of a conventional metal cation, Fe+C 6 F 4 I. The metal distonic ion structure of this ion was demonstrated by ion-molecule reactions and collision-induced dissociation. Fluorine substitution on the benzene ring facilitates iodine atom migration by the strong inductive withdrawal of electrons and forming the dπ-pπ bond.

40|$|AbstractThe use of amine {{solvents}} in post-combustion {{carbon capture}} (PCCC) pilot and demonstration plants has {{increased over the}} last several years, and subsequently a clear understanding of the potential human and environmental impacts of those solvents has become increasingly more important. EPRI convened a workshop of international stakeholders in 2011 entitled “Health and Environmental Toxicity of Amines for Post-Combustion Carbon Capture: Launching a Dialogue on Research Needs”. A main goal was to bring together members of the solvent development community, government agencies, environmental organizations, academic researchers, industry, and other stakeholders to discuss different approaches to evaluating toxicity of solvents for CO 2 capture, particularly in face of proprietary issues. Several research needs were identified, including improved risk assessment methodologies, additional pilot plant emissions data, improved understanding of atmospheric chemistry and losses. However despite these critical knowledge gaps the key outcome was that these gaps are “fillable” and are not “deal- breakers” for the technology. Another critical need identified by a majority of the 2011 Workshop attendees was to standardize stack sampling and analytical methods for amines and their degradation products. This led to the development in early 2012 of an international “Amine and Amine Degradation Products Methods Standardization Working Group”. The group goals are to collaboratively evaluate efficacy of methods that already have or could be applied in power plant stacks, to discuss how to improve characterization of sampling artifacts, and to design a testing program to evaluate various sampling and analytical methods. The long-term goal of the working group is to produce guidelines for more accurate and consistent determination of emissions of amines, related compounds, and their degradation products. Methods reviewed included both online (e. g.

40|$|Dental handpieces (HP’s) {{are used}} during semi-{{critical}} and critical dental procedures that imply the HP must be sterile {{at the point}} of use. The aim {{of this study was to}} undertake a quantitative and qualitative analysis of dental HP contamination to inform the development of HP cleaning. Preliminary validation work on protein <b>desorbtion</b> methods and protein detection assays resulted in boiling in 1 % sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS) and the o-phthaldialedhyde (OPA) assay (sensitivity 5 μg/ml) selected for further use in this study. A quantitative and qualitative analysis of HP microbial and protein contamination was then undertaken. Before decontamination, bacteria were isolated from high speed HP’s (n= 40) (median 200 cfu, range 0 - 1. 9 x 104 CFU/instrument), low speed HP’s(n- 40) (median 400 cfu, range 0 - 1 x 104 CFU/instrument) and surgical HP’s (n= 20) (median 1 x 103, range 0 - 3. 7 x 104 CFU/instrument). A range of oral bacteria were identified in addition to Staphylococcus aureus and Propionibacterium acnes. Protein was detected from high speed HP’s (median 1. 3, range 0 - 210 g), low speed HP’s (median 15. 41 μg, range 0 - 448 μg) and surgical HP’s (median 350 μg, range 127. 5 – 1, 936 μg) before decontamination. Serum albumin and salivary mucin were identified on surgical HP’s before decontamination. Calcium based deposits and contaminants trapped in lubricating oil were also detected using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDX). The efficacy of detergents and a HP cleaning solution at cleaning HP contaminants was assessed in vitro with a standard test soil and disruption of biofilms with a range of cleaning efficacies noted from each cleaning solution tested. Alkaline detergents caused a significant biomass disruption of P. acnes biofilms compared to ROH 2 O alone. HP cleaning solution resulted in fixation of the biofilm and blood to the surface. The efficacy of novel HP cleaning machines was also assessed using a test soil based on the data generated in this study. Efficacy varied between devices tested with one demonstrating efficient protein removal in all but 1 HP location. The data presented describes a quantitative and qualitative assessment of common contaminants of HP’s, mainly bacteria, salivary mucin and serum albumin. In-vivo biofouling levels of HP’s are several fold lower than standard test soil formulations and consideration should be given to use of HP test soil based on in-vivo data to validate HP cleaning processes. The data generated in this thesis should aid in designing dental HP test soils and cleaning regimens. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{critical}} issues still facing the implementation of extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) into mainstream manufacturing for integrated circuit (IC) production is cleanliness. EUV photons at 13. 5 nm are easily absorbed by many species, including dust, thin-film layers, and other debris present {{in the path of}} the photons. Carrying out EUVL inside a vacuum helps reduce the amount of photon loss for illumination, however contamination in the sys- tem is unavoidable, especially due to carbon growth on the multilayer mirror collectors and to soft defects in the form of organic contamination on the mask. Traditional cleaning methods employ the use of wet chemicals to etch contamination off of a surface, however this is limited in the sub-micron range of contaminant particles due to lack of transport of sufficient liquid chemical to the surface in order to achieve satisfactory particle removal. According to the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS), the photomask must be particle free at inspection below 30 nm. However, when analyzing the ability of traditional methods to meet the cleaning needs set forth by the ITRS, these methods fall short and often add more contamination to the surface targeted for cleaning. With that in mind, a new cleaning method is being developed to supplant these traditional methods. Preliminary research into a plasma-based method to clean organic contaminants from lithographic materials constructed an experimental device that demonstrated the removal of both polystyrene latex nanoparticles (representing hydrocarbon contamination) in the range of 30 nm to 500 nm, as well as the removal of 30 nm carbon film layers on silicon wafers. This research, called the Plasma-Assisted Cleaning by Metastable Atomic Neutralization (PACMAN) process is being developed with semiconductor manufacturing cleaning in mind. A model of the helium metastable density within the processing chamber has been developed in addition to experimental measurements of the metastable density at the sample surface. Cleaning efficiency has been linked to both metastable density as well as electric field in the plasma sheath. Electric field calculations in the plasma sheath reveal that an electric field pointing into the plasma is needed for achieving high cleaning rates of hydrocarbons. Operating the PACMAN process in this fashion allows for cleaning rates of approximately 1. 2 x 10 ^ 7 ± 5. 1 x 10 ^ 5 nm^ 3 /min without causing damage to the surrounding structure of the sample being cleaned. Carbon contamination in the form of carbon films on lithographic material have been shown to clean at rates of approximately 3. 0 x 10 ^ 6 ± 1. 3 x 10 ^ 5 nm^ 3 /min. The PACMAN process works by utilizing helium metastable atoms to break apart the contamination to be cleaned. As helium metastables interact with the surface of contamination, bonding electrons from the surface are ‘stolen’ by the metastable helium resulting in ‘holes’ where a bonding electron used to be. In this way, the structure of the contamination is compromised and allows for the removal either through <b>desorbtion</b> of C_xH_y molecules or by chain scission of the hydrocarbon backbone. The ultimate goal of this research is to understand the removal mechanism and provide ranges for the important parameters that lead to contamination removal from lithographic materials...|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{analysis}} have widely {{been used}} for the characterization of various materials, but only few studies concern its application to atmospheric particulate matter (Matuschek et al., 2004; Duarte and Duarte, 2008). All these studies {{are focused on the}} identification or quantification of desorbed organic species. Among inorganics, the species that are expected to thermally desorb from PM are ammonium salts and water. Ammonium salts are subjected to solid/vapour equilibria that are responsible for one of the main artefacts in PM determination. The extent of these artefacts has been proved to be influenced by water vapour, which may be absorbed on particles. In the scientific literature, however, only a few and contrasting results have been reported about the analytical determination of water in PM samples, and they have been mostly obtained by the Karl Fischer method (Otha et al., 1998; Tsai and Kuo, 2005). In this work, the thermal behaviour of water and ammonium salts has been examined under controlled conditions, with the purpose of exploring the potential of thermogravimetry and thermal <b>desorbtion</b> techniques with respect to both the analytical determination of water and the study of sampling artifacts mechanisms. The themogravimetric curves of reference materials NIST 1648 and NIST 1649 a (figure 1) show, as expected, different steps of mass loss. In the range from 25 °C to 180 °C a loss of ca. 6 % (6. 3 % for NIST 1648 and 4. 9 % for NIST 1649 a) in two steps has been evidenced. These losses have been assigned, respectively, to weakly and strongly bounded water by using hyphenated TG-MS and TG-FTIR and by carrying out the chemical analysis of the residual obtained after heating at different temperatures. Although the method needs further validation, the thermo-gravimetric determination of PM water content seems to be a convenient alternative to the use of Karl Fischer method. Despite the evidence of ammonium salts evolution during the sampling at ambient temperature, the loss of ammonium salts from reference materials starts above 180 °C and the residual concentrations of nitrate, chloride and ammonium become negligible at about 310 °C. Mass loss registered by the TG analysis in the 180 - 310 °C range is 7. 2 % for NIST 1648 and 7. 9 % for NIST 1649 a. This loss is partially due to inorganic salts (i. e. for NIST 1648 : ammonium 1. 8 %, nitrate ca. 1, 1 %, chloride 0. 3 % and sulfate, that partially decomposes to SO 2, ca. 1. 1 %) and partially to organic matter. The latter has been estimated to be about 2. 5 % by EC/OC thermoanalysis carried out in the same temperature range. Similar results have been obtained also on real PM 10 samples collected on Teflon membranes at an urban site in Rome, Italy. Even though the presence of the filter causes a worsening of signal to background ratio, also in this case water loss at T< 120 °C may be measured with sufficient repeatability (about 10 % on pairs of equivalent samples). In the case of real PM samples, all the other release processes occur at lower temperatures than in the case of NIST (about 60 °C less). The reasons for this behavior are not clear, but it is reasonable to hypothesize that the aging of dust plays a significant role. Anyway, no significant losses of inorganic ions and OC can be detected below 120 °C, in contrast with the usual behaviour observed during the sampling phase (negative artifact due to the release of ammonium salts). About 80 % of the mass losses in the range 120 - 250 °C were due to inorganic ions and OC. After heating up to 250 °C ammonium concentration was always below 15 % of the initial value, while nitrate and chloride residual amounts strongly depended on the nature of collected PM and were much higher in case of high contribution of natural dust (sea-salt and soil contributions). This residual nitrate and chloride concentrations remain constant also after further heating and are probably associated with sodium salts. This work was supported by private fundings Duarte, R. M.
