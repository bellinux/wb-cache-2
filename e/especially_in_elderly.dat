50|$|Attrition is loss of tooth {{substance}} {{caused by}} physical tooth-to-tooth contact. The word attrition {{is derived from}} the Latin verb attritium, which refers to the action of rubbing against something. Attrition mostly causes wear of the incisal and occlusal surfaces of the teeth. Attrition has been associated with masticatory force and parafunctional activity such as bruxism. A degree of attrition is normal, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>elderly</b> individuals.|$|E

5000|$|Dry skin (xerosis) {{involves}} increased {{thickness of}} stratum corneum (hyperkeratosis), which may occur due to various reasons including aging, humidity {{of the environment}} or UV irradiation. The accumulation of corneocyte clumps {{on the surface of}} the skin may lead to abnormal detachment of squames as visible clusters. Xerosis is common, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>elderly</b> individuals [...] which may be due to decreased quantity of free amino acids, a constituent of natural moisturizing factor. Consequently, many moisturizers in the markets incorporate the components of the natural moisturizing factor as well as keratin and elastin.|$|E

5000|$|One study {{looked at}} reminiscence therapy {{for people with}} two types of dementia: Alzheimer's disease and {{vascular}} dementia. [...] Those with Alzheimer's disease experienced significant improvement of withdrawal (so they withdrew less and interacted with others more) compared with the control group immediately after intervention. Participants suffering from vascular dementia showed significant improvement of withdrawal and cognitive function compared with the control immediately after intervention and after a 6 month follow up. [...] Sustained intervention {{may be required to}} maintain these effects over time, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>elderly</b> people with Alzheimer’s disease whose improvement in withdrawal was no longer seen after 6 months.|$|E
50|$|A. urinae {{may also}} cause {{invasive}} infections including urosepsis and infective endocarditis, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>elderly</b> men with underlying urinary tract diseases.A. urinae {{is sensitive to}} many commonly used antibiotics such as penicillin, cephalosporins, and vancomycin. However, the bacterium is often resistant to many antibiotics used in urinary tract infections such as sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin. Nitrofurantoin {{has been reported to}} be effective in one series of 42 clinical isolates. The bacterium can form biofilms on foreign materials and can aggregate human platelets, two features of potential importance for the disease causing capacity of this organism.A. urinae is the most common aerococcus isolated from invasive human infections whereas Aerococcus sanguinicola is isolated from human urine as often as A. urinae.|$|E
5000|$|Migratory {{stomatitis}} is {{a condition}} that involves the tongue and other oral mucosa. The common migratory glossitis (geographic tongue) affects the anterior {{two thirds of the}} dorsal and lateral tongue mucosa of 1% to 2.5% of the population, with one report of up to 12.7% of the population. The tongue is often fissured, <b>especially.</b> <b>in</b> <b>elderly</b> individuals. In the American population, a lower prevalence was reported among Mexican Americans (compared with Caucasians and African Americans) and cigarette smokers. When other oral mucosa, beside the dorsal and lateral tongue, are involved, the term migratory stomatitis (or ectopic geographic tongue) is preferred. In this condition, lesions infrequently involve also the ventral tongue and buccal or labial mucosa. They are rarely reported on the soft palate and floor of the mouth.|$|E
2500|$|Though rare, {{residual}} [...] "hangover" [...] effects after night-time {{administration of}} temazepam occasionally occur.

2500|$|Many {{people are}} unwell before {{breaking}} a hip; {{it is common}} for the break to have been caused by a fall due to some illness, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> the <b>elderly.</b> [...] Nevertheless, the stress of the injury, and a likely surgery, increases the risk of medical illness including heart attack, stroke, and chest infection.|$|R
50|$|The {{clinical}} presentation of hydrocephalus varies with chronicity. Acute dilatation of the ventricular system {{is more likely}} to manifest with the nonspecific signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. By contrast chronic dilatation (<b>especially</b> <b>in</b> the <b>elderly</b> population) may have a more insidious onset presenting, for instance, with Hakim's triad (Adams triad).|$|R
50|$|Suicide {{prevention}} {{is a term}} used for the collective efforts to {{reduce the incidence of}} suicide through preventative measures. Reducing access to certain methods, such as firearms or toxins can reduce risk. Other measures include reducing access to charcoal (for burning) and barriers on bridges and subway platforms. Treatment of drug and alcohol addiction, depression, and those who have attempted suicide in the past may also be effective. Some have proposed reducing access to alcohol as a preventative strategy (such as reducing the number of bars). Although crisis hotlines are common there is little evidence to support or refute their effectiveness. In young adults who have recently thought about suicide, cognitive behavioral therapy appears to improve outcomes. Economic development through its ability to reduce poverty may be able to decrease suicide rates. Efforts to increase social connection, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>elderly</b> males, may be effective. The World Suicide Prevention Day is observed annually on September 10 {{with the support of the}} International Association for Suicide Prevention and the World Health Organization.|$|E
30|$|In simeprevir with peginterferon and {{ribavirin}} therapy, viral relapse {{was relatively}} frequent. <b>Especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>elderly</b> patients, the relapse rate was high after completing treatment, instead of low frequency of discontinuation by the adverse events.|$|E

50|$|The {{sedative}} {{effects of}} cyclobenzaprine are {{likely due to}} its antagonistic effect on histamine, serotonin, and muscarinic receptors.

Treatment protocols and support should follow the same as for any structurally related tricyclic, such as tricyclic antidepressants.|$|R
40|$|Acute {{complete}} oculomotor palsy with headache is {{a classical}} {{presentation of an}} extrinsic compression most commonly due to a posterior communicating artery aneurysm.

40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} of a predilection of neurofibrillary tangle formation and choline acetyltransferase deficiency for the temporal lobe in Alzheimer's disease.

30|$|Introduction: Patients {{admitted}} to {{the intensive care unit}} (ICU) usually require use of hypnotics and sedatives to ensure comfort and proper adaptation to mechanical ventilation. An important requirement for an adequate sedation is frequent and proper assessment of its depth. Inadequate sedation can lead to problems of over-sedation, under-sedation and/or delirium in ICU, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>elderly</b> patients.|$|E
3000|$|Odontoid {{fracture}} type II {{is found}} to have high incidence of nonunion after the conservative management, <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> <b>elderly</b> patients (over 50  years) [5]; so, surgical treatment is recommended.
