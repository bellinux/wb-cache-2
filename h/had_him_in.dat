Ted Stevens served as Acting Minority Leader during his primary campaign.|$|E

25|$|Hogan {{was born}} in Little Rock, Arkansas on November 27, 1917. He entered the film {{industry}} {{at the age of}} nineteen, his first role in the small part of one of the young men in a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camp in the 1937 drama Blazing Barriers. His next film <b>had</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the featured role of Bob D. Wilson in Annapolis Salute, directed by Christy Cabanne. After small roles in Saturday's Heroes (1937), and The Storm (1938), he was again seen in a principal role in the 1938 John Ford comedy-drama, Submarine Patrol. In 1939 he appeared in Charlie Chan in Reno (1939).|$|E
25|$|The Flyers' 40th year anniversary season {{turned out}} to be the worst in {{franchise}} history. The Flyers traded Michal Handzus to Chicago, lost Kim Johnsson to free agency and Eric Desjardins and team captain Keith Primeau retired in the off-season. Peter Forsberg replaced Primeau as team captain, but a chronic foot injury developing in last season's Olympics <b>had</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> and out of the lineup throughout the season and limited his effectiveness. Eight games into the regular season and with a record of 1–6–1, General Manager Bobby Clarke resigned and Head Coach Ken Hitchcock was fired. Assistant Coach John Stevens replaced Hitchcock and Assistant General Manager Paul Holmgren took on Clarke's responsibilities on an interim basis.|$|E
25|$|Sagan {{continued}} his successes by grabbing his first Monument {{victory at the}} Tour of Flanders, shedding his last opponent Sep Vanmarcke on the Paterberg and finishing the last 14 kilometers of the race solo, as the Cancellara-Vanmarcke duet <b>had</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> their sight but could not reach him. Sagan dedicated the win to two cyclists who died recently, Antoine Demoitié and Daan Myngheer. A week later, he took part in Paris-Roubaix, finishing eleventh after a split in the peloton occurred. He performed a stunt on a cobbled sector as Cancellara crashed directly before him by executing, a bunny hop over the Swiss' bike and avoided the crash, despite having only one foot clipped into his pedals at the time.|$|E

25|$|Since the 1990s {{except for}} Awwal Number, {{the rest of}} the eight films {{directed}} by him were box office failures, but Sau Crore (1991) and Censor (2000) were critically acclaimed. His last film Chargesheet (2011) was panned by critics across the board. The only two hero films he acted in were Insaniyat in 1955 with Dilip Kumar and Return of Jewel Thief with Dharmendra in 1996. He also starred in English films like The Evil Within (1970) where he was paired opposite Vietnamese actress Kieu Chinh and Zeenat Aman and Guide (English Version). The English language film 'The Evil Within' was a 20th-Century Fox production which couldn't get the nod from the concerned authorities due to its parallel track dealing with opium selling and thus the Indian viewers were deprived of this American venture. Of the 114 Hindi films he appeared in in 6 decades, Kahin Aur Chal (1968) had a delayed release in the early 1970s and the multi-starrer film Ek Do Teen Chaar (1980) remained unreleased and Shrimanji (1968) <b>had</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> a guest appearance. 82 of these were box office hits and 29 were commercial failures. By 2011, he had the second most solo lead roles in Hindi films— 92 with Rajesh Khanna having the record for maximum films as solo lead hero in Hindi films - 106.|$|E
25|$|Hart and Smith later {{joined forces}} with Bret Hart, Jim Neidhart, and Brian Pillman {{to form a new}} form of the Hart Foundation, a heel faction which feuded with Stone Cold Steve Austin and other American wrestlers. This created an {{interesting}} rift between American fans, where the Hart Foundation were vilified, and Canadian fans, who revered the Hart Foundation. Smith and Owen dropped the World Tag Team Titles to Austin and Michaels, and lost the final match in a tournament for the vacant Tag Team Titles to Austin and Dude Love. Smith then started a feud with Ken Shamrock for the European Title, and eventually lost the European Title to Shawn Michaels at the British Pay-per-view event One Night Only. Smith was booked in the main event to defend the belt against Michaels. However, Michaels convinced Vince McMahon that he should win, as it would create build-up not only for his impending rematch with Bret Hart, but also for a rematch against Smith at the next British pay-per-view. Smith reluctantly agreed, and fans at the event, who gave Smith an ovation, voiced their displeasure by viciously booing Michaels and littering the ring with garbage. This marks the only time Smith lost on a WWF card in the United Kingdom. After the 1997 Survivor Series which became famous for the Montreal Screwjob in which Vince McMahon changed the finish of Bret Hart's match and had him lose the WWF title to Michaels (who was also in on it) despite Hart not actually submitting when Michaels <b>had</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> a Sharpshooter, Smith, along with Bret Hart and Neidhart, left the WWF for WCW.|$|E

Taggart recounted in 2010, [...] "He’s an amazing guitar player, and he played on the record. People don’t know that he had a lot to do with that stuff. He was very influential.

That night on Raw, Hardy attacked Edge backstage and again later during Edge's match with Kane, leaving the commentators speechless. Before being escorted out of the building by security, Hardy stated that Edge and Lita would pay for their actions and told fans that they could see him at Ring of Honor while security officials and event staff were trying to restrain him. Hardy also called out Johnny Ace as security <b>had</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> handcuffs taking him out of the arena. This caused an uproar amongst fans, who were confused and wondered if the whole thing was a work or a shoot. Similar occurrences repeated during the following two weeks.|$|E
500|$|Fowler and Nick McHatton, a TV Fanatic critic, {{stated that}} this was the best episode of the program since [...] "Pilot"; Handlen said that the episode, for the most part, was [...] "a great hour of television, and a fine uptick from the last couple weeks of Awake", while Bonaime called it [...] "one of Awake most {{compelling}} episodes to date". McHatton called the emotional problems of the episode [...] "heart wrenching" [...] to watch", as they <b>had</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> tears; he gave a [...] "4.9 out of 5" [...] rating for the episode. Handlen complimented the [...] "powerful scene, as [...] tries to convince her father that he should do anything possible to avoid losing touch with his daughter", and also noted that the episode [...] "raises the stakes for , changing what he's come to accept as his routine {{for the first time since}} the start of the series: while bungee jumping at a fair with Rex and Emma in , [...] has a fainting spell, and comes to in [...] ". Handlen claimed the episode [...] "doesn't seem to fit everything else".|$|E
500|$|Reflecting on the serial, Nigel Kneale said, [...] "Frankly, I {{was never}} {{happy with the}} whole idea in the first place. The central idea was too ordinary". Although Kneale {{was pleased with the}} high {{production}} values, he was dissatisfied with the casting, believing that John Mills [...] "didn't have the authority for Quatermass". He was similarly unimpressed with Simon MacCorkindale, noting that [...] "We <b>had</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> Beasts playing an idiot and he was very good at that". Kneale disliked the depiction of the Planet People, as his inspiration had been angry punks rather than hippies (as evidenced by his portrayal of Kickalong as a gun-toting lunatic who commits multiple motiveless murders). Producer Ted Childs thinks that [...] "the primary problems with it were (a) it was perhaps too depressing a story for a popular television audience and (b) the punters were used to a fairly high standard of technical presentation from American television... And we just couldn't afford that". Executive producer Verity Lambert's opinion is that it [...] "didn't have the staying power of the originals, but then that's almost inevitable when you try to bring something back in a slightly different form".|$|E

500|$|The {{death of}} Mary Jo Kopechne in the Chappaquiddick {{incident}} had greatly hindered Kennedy's future presidential prospects, {{and shortly after}} the incident he declared {{that he would not}} be a candidate in the 1972 U.S. presidential election. Nevertheless, polls in 1971 suggested he could win the nomination if he tried, and Kennedy gave some thought to running. In May of that year he decided not to, saying he needed [...] "breathing time" [...] to gain more experience and to take care of the children of his brothers and that in sum, [...] "It feels wrong in my gut." [...] Nevertheless, in November 1971, a Gallup Poll still <b>had</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> first place in the Democratic nomination race with 28percent. George McGovern was close to clinching the Democratic nomination in June 1972, when various anti-McGovern forces tried to get Kennedy to enter the contest at the last minute, but he declined. At the 1972 Democratic National Convention, McGovern repeatedly tried to recruit Kennedy as his vice presidential running mate, but Kennedy turned him down. When McGovern's choice of Thomas Eagleton stepped down soon after the convention, McGovern again tried to get Kennedy to take the nod, again without success. McGovern instead chose Kennedy's brother-in-law Sargent Shriver.|$|E

2500|$|MacCorkindale played {{astronomer}} Joe Kapp in Nigel Kneale's TV serial Quatermass (1979), starring alongside John Mills. He {{had previously}} starred in {{an episode of}} Kneale's series Beasts and enjoyed appearing {{in the role of}} Kapp, finding it a change from the typecast romantic roles that he had become accustomed to playing, while noting that it was [...] "challenging" [...] conveying the character's strong Jewish faith. Kneale later expressed disappointment with MacCorkindale's performance, commenting, [...] "We <b>had</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> Beasts playing an idiot and he was very good at that".|$|E

2500|$|Gover {{played his}} first county match against Sussex in June 1928, {{but did not}} {{establish}} himself permanently until 1930. With Freddie Brown, Percy Fender and Maurice Allom available up to 1932, Gover did not play a major role, but with Brown and Allom moving into business Gover was called upon to bear a much heavier burden in the dry summer of 1933 and responded with 98 County Championship wickets. His advance {{was the result of}} curbing a tendency to overstep the crease, but his cumbersome action was still criticised even as his strong build of 188cm (6 feet 2inches) and 87kg (13 stone 10 pounds), combined with vast capacity for work on the placid Oval wickets <b>had</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> contention for a Test place against such candidates as Bowes, Farnes, [...] "Nobby" [...] Clark and Copson.|$|E
2500|$|After seeing Armie Hammer's {{performance}} in The Social Network (2010), Guadagnino [...] "fell in love" [...] {{with him and}} cultivated his passion for Hammer and the movies he made afterwards. The director {{found him to be}} a [...] "sophisticated actor, with a great range" [...] and <b>had</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> mind for the role of Oliver. Hammer, who expressed his interest in Guadagnino's A Bigger Splash, met with the director years before the film went into production. When Hammer got the script, he almost turned down the role because of the nudity that was originally in it. [...] "I did want to pass. It scared me," [...] he said. [...] "There’s a lot of stuff here that I’ve never done on film before. But there’s no way I can’t do this, mostly because it scares me so much." [...] According to Guadagnino, Hammer was going to pass on the role through his agent, but then changed his mind {{at the end of their}} conversation. This is the third film that has Hammer playing a gay character, following Clint Eastwood's J. Edgar (2011) and Stanley Tucci's Final Portrait (2017).|$|E
