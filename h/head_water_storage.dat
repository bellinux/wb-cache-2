40|$|A {{large part}} of the {{environmental}} restoration required by the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan calls for more water-storage on lands south of Lake Okeechobee in order to restore the natural water flows of the Everglades watershed. The Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) can be used for increased <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> in order to relieve coastal estuaries of excess water in the rainy season. This <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> can deliver additional ecosystem services of soil retention and reduced CO 2 emissions that could compensate farmers for the cost of <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> by increasing long term farm profitability. The goals of this study were 1) to quantify the environmental and economic trade-offs of different <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> scenarios using water-tolerant sugarcane cultivars, and 2) to quantify the amount of <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> possible in the EAA under different <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> scenarios. A mathematical model was developed to calculate soil depth, soil subsidence, depth to the water table, sugarcane production, farm return, <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> and carbon loss for three different sugarcane cultivars with different water-tolerances. A GIS tool is also developed to estimate the amount of <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> possible in the EAA. The study found that even though water-tolerant sugarcane cultivars experience higher yields and net returns than non-water-tolerant cultivars the <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> costs with these water tolerant cultivars was greater. Raising water tables on farm lands did have the environmental benefits of reduced soil subsidence, extended farm life and increased years of <b>water</b> <b>storage.</b> However total CO 2 emissions rise from 14 to 136 %. Results of the GIS analysis revealed that <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> capacity for a DWT of 61 cm is 1, 404, 562 ac-ft, 1, 417, 400 ac-ft for DWT 45 cm and 1, 474, 692 ac-ft for DWT 20 cm. The GIS analysis was also able to identify flow ways that could possibly carry water south from Lake Okeechobee and ultimately to the WCAs south of the EAA. These results show that raising water tables in the EAA to deliver the ecosystem service of expanded <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> is overall more costly, but yearly costs are very low. Therefore <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> on farmlands is an affordable interim method of <b>water</b> <b>storage...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{effectively}} recover surface mass or geoid height changes from the gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) time-variable gravity models, spatial smoothing {{is required to}} minimize errors from noise. Spatial smoothing, such as Gaussian smoothing, not only reduces the noise but also attenuates the real signals. Here we investigate possible amplitude attenuations and phase changes of seasonal <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> variations in four drainage basins (Amazon, Mississippi, Ganges and Zambezi) using an advanced global land data assimilation system. It appears that Gaussian smoothing significantly affects GRACE-estimated basin-scale seasonal <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> changes, e. g., {{in the case of}} 800 km smoothing, annual amplitudes are reduced by about 25 - 40 %, while annual phases are shifted by up to 10 Â°. With these effects restored, GRACE-estimated <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> changes are consistently larger than model estimates, indicating that the land surface model appears to underestimate terrestrial <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> change. Our analysis based on simulation suggests that normalized attenuation effects (from Gaussian smoothing) on seasonal <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> change are relatively insensitive to the magnitude of the true signal. This study provides a numerical approach {{that can be used to}} restore seasonal <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> change in the basins from spatially smoothed GRACE data. Â© Springer-Verlag 2006...|$|R
40|$|In {{a global}} perspective, {{little is known}} about {{terrestrial}} <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> and evaporation. However, these two variables of the hydrological cycle play a key role not only for agriculture and the estimation of current and future water availability, but also for improvements in seasonal forecasting and climate modeling. Using the atmospheric water balance, accurate estimates of terrestrial <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> variations and evaporation for large river basins can be obtained. Here, we present diagnostic estimates derived with this approach using the recent ECMWF reanalysis ERA-Interim, together with measured runoff for the estimated terrestrial <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> changes, and precipitation for the evapotranspiration estimates. Comparisons with ERA- 40 -based estimates from the Basin-Scale Water-Balance (BSWB) dataset (Seneviratne et al. 2004, Hirschi et al. 2006 a,b; www. iacweb. ethz. ch/data/water_balance/) are performed for several basins. In this analysis, we focus on dif-ferences in the annual cycles {{as well as in the}} long-term drifts of the derived terrestrial <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> changes. Moreover, we compare the diagnosed ERA-Interim-based terrestrial <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> changes with in-situ soil mois-ture and snow measurements, as well as satellite retrievals from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE).

40|$|The {{development}} of <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> schemes in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) {{is considered a}} major aid for those regions with unequal water distribution, limited accessibility and anticipated climate change impacts. Great attention is given by many SSA countries to set up different <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> schemes that may improve rural and urban development on a national level. The funding for the <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> schemes is often derived from foreign agencies which conduct feasibility studies for the financing of potential investments. Often however, the feasibility studies rely on a single monetary criterion which may not identify the most appropriate <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> in each case. In addition, limited data availability in many SSA countries increases the difficulty of identifying the most suitable storage option. This paper develops a multicriteria framework for the integrated evaluation of <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> strategies in Sub-Saharan African countries. A set of economic, agronomic and opinion-based criteria are assessed through the PROMETHEE II outranking approach. The introduction of crop modeling complements the limited field data available in agronomic criteria and enhances the scientific rigor of the method. Ethiopia is adopted as a representative case of SSA countries where a diverse set of <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> options is currently under construction, often financed by foreign agencies...|$|R
