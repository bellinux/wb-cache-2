5000|$|Friday 18 December 1896, The Ferry Manly {{struck a}} sliding blow with the collier Merksworth which {{commenced}} to promptly start sinkingBetween 1 and 2 pm yesterday the steam collier Merksworth, bound from the Wallarah Coal Company’s mine, laden with coal, was {{heading up the}} harbour making a course for Miller's Point or somewhere about there, where she usually gets orders as to what wharf or ship she is to discharge her cargo at, when she met with a disastrous collision. She had rounded Bradley's Head, and was making an <b>inside</b> <b>course</b> to pass Pinchgut. Following her came the Manly Beach Company's new steamer Manly, {{one of the fastest}} ferry steamers in the harbour, and soon after passing Bradley's these two steamers, presumably under complete control, came so close that the one hit the other what is technically known as a [...] "sliding blow" [...] That graceful act proved sufficient for the struck ship to almost immediately sink, and cause an almost miraculous escape of her crew. It would, {{in the absence of the}} official reports and the official inquiry which the Marine Board must hold, be improper to speculate as to which ship was the offender. The fact remains that the well-found steam collier the Merksworth received such injury as ended her career for the time being in her particular sphere of usefulness. The accounts given by some of those who were aboard the Merksworth differ in minor details, though they are unanimous in that they were ahead until the nose of the Manly was poked into the midship part of their ship, smashing the bridge and some of the upper works It came as a surprise, and after realising that they had been struck nobody suggested that the blow was serious until the hissing caused by the inrush of water below into the boiler room was heard, and it came in quickly, for before the Merksworth could reach Kirribilli Point she was doomed, and the best that could be done was done under the circumstances, namely, head her for the nearest land and jam her head there, thus saving risking the lives of the men The other steamer, Manly, was by that time well up tho harbour on her way to the Manly wharf “They hit us on our starboard side," [...] said one of the crew of the Merksworth, “and we didn't think there was much in it, but she has a projecting propeller head, and that must have rammed us underneath" [...] And that is the accepted theory of the cause of the sinking of the MerksworthAll were silent on the ferry-boat when official reports were asked for, but the passengers were less disposed to be reticent [...] "The thing was all done in a moment," [...] said one [...] " [...] There was some whistling and singing out, but the hit was not a loud one, and we really thought the other boat was but little damaged Imagine when, after arriving in the city, we heard that the collier had sunk We had no idea of such a. thing As to who was in the right or the wrong I should be sorry to say Naturally we were a bit scared, and there was some excitement, but nothing very, sensational [...] " [...] On being seen by a reporter, the master of the Manly declined to make a statementThe steamer Merksworth lies a little to the westward of the entrance to Mosman’s Bay Her stem is sticking a few feet above water on rock The stern is in eight fathoms on a sandy bottom A foot or so of her mizzenmast was visible yesterday afternoon, and a little more of the foremast, but the top of her funnel was at least 15ft under water A lot of boats were out in the evening to inspect the place in which the steamer sank, and, judging from the rugged formation of that part of the harbour, the idea forces itself on one's mind that it was a case of [...] "touch and go," [...] of beaching or sinking in deep waterThe water police were quickly on the scene Inspector Hyem, in reply to an inquiry, said [...] " [...] It was lucky there were no lives lost We brought ashore eight of the crew, the captain and four others remained by the wreck The men brought their baggage, and they saved the Merksworth cat, s which seemed to have been a sort of pet on board”The Manly, the new Steamer which originally was built for the now Co-operative Company and the name changed subsequent.) from Emancipator to Manly, was so little damaged that she continued her timetable service throughout the remainder of the day at the company 's office it was stated that tile damage would he covered by £5The steam collier Merksworth was once a crack steamer on this coast carrying mails and passengers. like many other well-built ships, when she became a bit old her place was taken by younger, larger, and more imposing steamers she was launched at Paisley, Scotland, 22 years ago, an iron steamer of 270 tons, 10 horsepower nominal, and is now owned by the Wallarah Coal CompanyThe prime policy on the Merksworth is held by the South British Insurance Company, with re insurances ...|$|E

They have also influenced by their surroundings at the street level in ways that reduced the time limits for the speed of emergency response. The capacity of using progressing 3 D GIS for the headway and execution of GIS-based intelligent emergency response systems. The fact was at urging a quick emergency response to terrorist attacks on multi-level structures (e.g., multi-story office structures). A system design and a framework data show that facilitates the ground transportation capabilities with the <b>inside</b> <b>courses</b> <b>inside</b> multi-level structures into a protected 3 D GIS was examined. Issues of using adaptable representation stages were also discussed especially the prerequisite for the remote and versatile response plan.

A test use of expected 3 D structure data shows a GIS database for a nearby study area was demonstrated by Kwan and Lee (2005). The study indicates that reaction delay inside multi-level structures can be any longer than deferrals caused on the ground transportation framework, have the potential for impressively decreasing these postponements.|$|R
