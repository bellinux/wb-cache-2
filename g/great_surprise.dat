5|$|In {{the battles}} of Modrica and Meçad 7,000 Ottoman forces were left {{dead on the}} {{battlefield}} along with thousands of horses. The Albanians had suffered 1,000 casualties themselves and, in their exhaustion, they refused to pursue the fleeing Ottoman forces. Hamza Pasha and his staff were ransomed to the sultan. Raimon d'Ortafà reported Skanderbeg's victory to Alfonso who received it with great exuberance. Skanderbeg's victory over a ruler even more powerful than Murad came as a <b>great</b> <b>surprise</b> to the Albanians. Skanderbeg's reputation among his allies was redeemed and the Dukagjini opted for a reconciliation.|$|E
5|$|The {{homology}} groups H'i(S'n), with i > n, are all trivial. It therefore {{came as a}} <b>great</b> <b>surprise</b> historically {{that the}} corresponding homotopy groups are not trivial in general. This {{is the case that}} is of real importance: the higher homotopy groups πi(S'n), for i > n, are surprisingly complex and difficult to compute, and the effort to compute them has generated a significant amount of new mathematics.|$|E
5|$|Buxton (1995) {{tells the}} story of two men who left Mingulay together. One was visiting Barra, and the other {{intended}} to emigrate to New York. They said their farewells in Castlebay but it did not work out for the latter and he returned from the United States three months later. To his <b>great</b> <b>surprise</b> he met his friend in Castlebay again, who explained that he had been unable to return to Mingulay since they had last met because of adverse sea conditions. Similar difficulties experienced by visiting priests or doctors bound for Mingulay were a constant source of concern to the islanders.|$|E
60|$|The man stopped eating, and {{regarded}} {{me with the}} keenest scrutiny and the <b>greatest</b> <b>surprise.</b>|$|R
50|$|This is the {{continuation}} of a unique success story, and the Royal Gigolos will provide some <b>great</b> <b>surprises</b> for sure in the future.|$|R
6000|$|... "You bad boy!" [...] exclaimed this curious, little, old man; whereupon Martin {{stopped in}} his walk and stood still, gazing in the <b>greatest</b> <b>surprise</b> at him.|$|R
5|$|Reid was {{nominated}} as the UFA candidate in Vermilion during the 1921 provincial election, {{the first in}} which the UFA ran candidates. The Legislative Assembly of Alberta was dominated by the Liberals, who had governed Alberta since its creation in 1905. To Reid's <b>great</b> <b>surprise,</b> he defeated his Liberal opponent and {{was elected to the}} legislature, along with 37 of his fellow UFA candidates—enough to form a majority government. He chaired the first meeting of the new UFA caucus, at which it selected Herbert Greenfield as Premier. Reid was re-elected in the 1926 and 1930 elections.|$|E
5|$|Taylor {{took over}} as manager of Derby County in November 1982, to the <b>great</b> <b>surprise</b> of {{most people in the}} game. He brought in Roy McFarland as his assistant, and signed Archie Gemmill and Bobby Davison. At the time Derby were going through serious {{financial}} problems and were bottom of the table, but he steered them to a mid-table position {{by the end of the}} season with a 15-match unbeaten run. In the Third Round of the FA Cup on 8 January 1983 they knocked out Clough's Forest team with a 2–0 win at the Baseball Ground. They reached the Fifth Round, where they were knocked out by Manchester United.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 2 passed {{closer to}} Enceladus (87,010km) on August 26, 1981, {{allowing}} higher-resolution images to be obtained. These images showed a young surface. They also revealed a surface with different regions with vastly different surface ages, with a heavily cratered mid- to high-northern latitude region, and a lightly cratered region {{closer to the}} equator. This geologic diversity contrasts with the ancient, heavily cratered surface of Mimas, another moon of Saturn slightly smaller than Enceladus. The geologically youthful terrains came as a <b>great</b> <b>surprise</b> to the scientific community, because no theory was then able to predict that such a small (and cold, compared to Jupiter's highly active moon Io) celestial body could bear signs of such activity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said Peter Rabbit, {{apparently}} in the <b>greatest</b> <b>surprise,</b> [...] "is this your sand pile, Striped Chipmunk? It's {{a very nice}} sand pile indeed. Is this where you live?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Frege responded {{promptly}} that [...] "Your {{discovery of}} the contradiction caused me the <b>greatest</b> <b>surprise</b> and, I would almost say, consternation, since it has shaken the basis on which I intended to build arithmetic".|$|R

5|$|While Cranmer was {{following}} Charles through Italy, {{he received a}} royal letter dated 1 October 1532 informing {{him that he had}} been appointed the new Archbishop of Canterbury, following the death of archbishop William Warham. Cranmer was ordered to return to England. The appointment had been secured by the family of Anne Boleyn, who was being courted by Henry. When Cranmer's promotion became known in London, it caused <b>great</b> <b>surprise</b> as Cranmer had previously held only minor positions in the Church. Cranmer left Mantua on 19 November and arrived in England at the beginning of January. Henry personally financed the papal bulls necessary for Cranmer's promotion to Canterbury. The bulls were easily acquired because the papal nuncio was under orders from Rome to please the English in an effort to prevent a final breach. The bulls arrived around 26 March 1533 and Cranmer was consecrated as archbishop on 30 March in St Stephen's Chapel. Even while they were waiting for the bulls, Cranmer continued to work on the annulment proceedings, which required greater urgency after Anne announced her pregnancy. Henry and Anne were secretly married on 24 or 25 January 1533 {{in the presence of a}} handful of witnesses. Cranmer did not learn of the marriage until a fortnight later.|$|E
25|$|The {{exponent}} is also universal, {{since it}} is the same in the Ising model as in the experimental magnet and gas, but it is not equal to the mean field value. This was a <b>great</b> <b>surprise.</b>|$|E
25|$|Then Lechambre {{returned}} to Salitran. He was expecting a heavy {{resistance from the}} revolutionaries who occupied the casa hacienda but to his <b>great</b> <b>surprise,</b> {{they were able to}} take the place without any resistance. They hoisted the red and gold flag of Spain and converted it as their headquarters.|$|E
6000|$|Everard recoiled in the <b>greatest</b> <b>surprise,</b> {{and next}} exclaimed, [...] "Impossible--it cannot be! The King of Scots has escaped from Bristol.--My Lord Wilmot, your talents for intrigue are well known; {{but this will}} not pass upon me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Frege {{promptly}} {{wrote back}} to Russell acknowledging the problem: Your {{discovery of the}} contradiction caused me the <b>greatest</b> <b>surprise</b> and, I would almost say, consternation, since it has shaken the basis on which I intended to build arithmetic.|$|R
60|$|It was {{on their}} return from such a day's outing that Myrtle met with her life's <b>greatest</b> <b>{{surprise}}.</b> Indeed, the surprise was shared by all but Uncle John, who had religiously kept the secret of Mr. Jones' identity.|$|R
25|$|This merger {{was viewed}} with <b>great</b> <b>surprise</b> by the {{financial}} press and security analysts. While Wachovia had been viewed as an acquisition candidate after running into problems with earnings and credit quality in 2000, the suitor shocked analysts as many speculated that Wachovia would be sold to Atlanta-based SunTrust.|$|E
25|$|Although most of {{his works}} are lost or {{out of sight in}} private {{collections}} he was also a painter and a graphic composer of immense talent. Some of his work was shown, to <b>great</b> <b>surprise</b> and admiration, in 2002 at an exhibit on the surrealist movement.|$|E
25|$|Hosking's entry {{received}} professional acclaim for {{the concept}} {{and quality of the}} design; his proposal becoming illustrated in The Builder magazine during the following year. It was therefore a <b>great</b> <b>surprise</b> when he learnt that the museum was indeed commissioning a building for the quadrangle - with the dome, circular plan and other features that had distinguished his proposal - but did not envisage crediting him for the competition idea.|$|E
6000|$|... "So! The seed is sown! It {{has been}} {{sprinkled}} {{with a generous}} hand! Believe me, my friend, that for this country there are in store very <b>great</b> <b>surprises.</b> I speak as one who knows! I do know! So!" ...|$|R
50|$|As {{the film}} progresses, each {{daughter}} encounters new men. When these new relationships blossom, their roles are broken {{and the living}} situation within the family changes. The father eventually brings the <b>greatest</b> <b>surprise</b> to the audience {{at the end of}} the story.|$|R
60|$|The {{man with}} the horrible face looked, with the <b>greatest</b> <b>surprise,</b> up the court, and down the court, and in at {{the windows of the}} houses--everywhere but at Sam Weller--and took another step forward, when he was brought to again by another shout.|$|R
25|$|Iwate {{took out}} a knife and {{assaulted}} the woman, slicing open her belly {{and took out the}} liver from the fetus. However, at that moment, Iwate caught sight of the protective charm that the woman had on her, giving Iwate a <b>great</b> <b>surprise.</b> It was the very same one that she left for her daughter when she left the capital. The woman she had just killed was none other than her very own daughter.|$|E
25|$|After the Pope's canonization, another miracle {{is said to}} {{have taken}} place when a Christian family activist named Clem Lane {{suffered}} a major heart attack and was placed in an oxygen tent, where he was given extreme unction. A relic of the Pope was placed over his tent, and he recovered to the <b>great</b> <b>surprise</b> of his doctors. A sister of Loretto at Webster College in St Louis, Missouri, claimed that her priest brother had been cured through the Pope's intercession as well.|$|E
25|$|In 1842, the French Consul General at Mosul, Paul-Émile Botta, {{began to}} search the vast mounds that lay along the {{opposite}} bank of the river. The locals whom he employed in these excavations, to their <b>great</b> <b>surprise,</b> came upon {{the ruins of a}} building at the mound of Khorsabad, which, on further exploration, {{turned out to be the}} royal palace of Sargon II, in which large numbers of reliefs were found and recorded, though they had been damaged by fire and were mostly too fragile to remove.|$|E
60|$|If a {{thunderbolt}} {{had fallen}} {{through the roof}} it would hardly have caused a <b>greater</b> <b>surprise</b> than the sight of Jack Minot walking slowly down the aisle, with a wrathful flash in the eyes he turned on Joe as he passed him.|$|R
5000|$|In general, when pushed {{upon by the}} enemy, reserve your fire {{till they}} {{approach}} very near, which will then put them into the <b>greatest</b> <b>surprise</b> and consternation, and give you an opportunity of rushing upon them with your hatchets and cutlasses to the better advantage.|$|R
50|$|The <b>greatest</b> <b>surprises</b> of the 2005 season {{were the}} great {{performance}} of Start, {{promoted to the}} Tippeligaen in the 2004 season and ended up winning silver, and the disappointing performance of Rosenborg which fought against relegation from the Premier League after winning it for 13 straight seasons.|$|R
25|$|The {{similarities}} between China today and New York 150 years ago shouldn't {{come as a}} <b>great</b> <b>surprise.</b> Adulteration on such a scandalous scale occurs in societies with a toxic combination of characteristics: a fast-growing capitalist economy coupled with a government {{unable or unwilling to}} regulate the food supply. In such get-rich-quick societies, there is a huge temptation to tamper with food, particularly when margins are low. The rewards are instant, and it's not always easy for consumers to detect the difference between the pure and the doctored—particularly with a substance like milk, which we have been taught to trust implicitly.|$|E
25|$|The {{defeat of}} the {{plebiscite}} came as a <b>great</b> <b>surprise</b> to most commentators because few had predicted that it would fail. The Labor movement, and the 'anti' cause in general, had fought under many disadvantages, and the 'yes' campaign had most of the media, many major public institutions, {{and many of the}} state governments on its side. Supporters of the referendum were circumspect in their analysis of the result, noting that only a few percentage points and fewer than 75,000 voters had separated the results. The support for the vote in Victoria was surprising to many, given that it had often been the locus of anti-conscription rhetoric.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} Hungary's recent travails, {{everyone}} expected the Hungarian players to advance from their group. The success of Wales therefore was a <b>great</b> <b>surprise</b> but the Welsh managed to draw all the group games and then beat the once-mighty Hungarians in a play-off match {{to decide which}} nation should follow Sweden into the knock-out stage. Had goal difference been the decider, Hungary would have gone through as the Hungarians had a goal ratio of 6–3 compared to 2–2 of Wales. As it was, Wales had the honour of meeting Brazil in the quarterfinals and becoming the recipient of young Pelé's first World Cup goal. The 1–1 draw between Wales and Mexico was the first point scored by Mexico in a World Cup.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Compose yourself, sir,' said Clennam, 'and take {{a little}} time to think. To think of the {{brightest}} and most fortunate accidents of life. We have all heard of <b>great</b> <b>surprises</b> of joy. They are not at an end, sir. They are rare, but not at an end.' ...|$|R
60|$|But, {{he was on}} {{his feet}} directly, and after {{sponging}} himself with a great show of dexterity began squaring again. The second <b>greatest</b> <b>surprise</b> I have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again, looking up at me out of a black eye.|$|R
6000|$|... "My darling, prepare {{yourself}} for the <b>greatest</b> <b>surprise</b> I have ever caused you. I am married. It {{is only a}} week to-day since I parted with my old name--it is only a week since I have been the happy wife of George Bartram, of St. Crux.|$|R
