5|$|For others, {{although}} the hunting of animal with hounds was made illegal by the Hunting Act 2004, the Exmoor <b>hunts</b> still meet in full regalia {{and there is}} a campaign to resurrect this rural sport. Nine <b>hunts</b> cover the area– the Devon and Somerset Staghounds and the Quantock Staghounds, the Exmoor, Dulverton West, Dulverton Farmers and West Somerset Foxhounds, the Minehead Harriers, the West Somerset Beagles and the North Devon Beagles. During the spring, amateur steeplechase meetings (point-to-points) are run by <b>hunts</b> at temporary courses such as Bratton Down and Holnicote. These, along with thoroughbred racing and pony racing, are an opportunity for farmers, hunt staff and the public to witness a day of traditional country entertainment.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to meat or fur <b>hunts,</b> {{there are also}} competition <b>hunts</b> to demonstrate the speed and skill of the dog. In these the raccoons are not killed, but are treed and released. Some of the largest competition <b>hunts</b> are the Grand American, Autumn Oaks, and Leafy Oaks. Coon hunting has been recorded in such books as Where the Red Fern Grows and popularized in stories and songs recorded by Jerry Clower, Jimmy Martin and others. In Alabama, there is a cemetery specifically for the burial of coonhounds.|$|E

5|$|Historically, migratory whales such as blue, fin, sei {{were very}} {{abundant}} in the island waters, but were severely reduced in numbers to near-extinction by commercial and illegal <b>hunts</b> including the mass illegal <b>hunts</b> by Soviet Union and Japan in 1960s to 1970s. Southern right and sperm were most severely hunted among these, hence the area was called the Middle Ground by whalers. It is likely that these two were once seasonal residents around the island where right whales prefer sheltered, very shallow bays while sperm whales mainly inhabit deep waters.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, humpback, minkes, {{sperm and}} many other smaller Odontoceti, {{including}} critically endangered species such as North Pacific right, western gray and northern fin, have been targets of illegal captures. The <b>hunts</b> use harpoons for dolphin <b>hunts</b> or intentionally drive whales into nets, reporting them as cases of entanglement. Humpback meat {{can be found in}} markets. In one case, humpbacks of unknown quantities were illegally hunted in the Exclusive Economic Zones of anti-whaling nations such as off Mexico and South Africa.|$|E

40|$|This bachelor's thesis {{deals with}} the {{compulsory}} connection of the rights to <b>hunt</b> with the ownership of the <b>hunting</b> lands. The aim of this work is to divide and describe two kinds of <b>hunting</b> grounds according to the types of ownership of the <b>hunting</b> lands. There is also an economic analysis of revenues and expenses regarding <b>hunting</b> rights in these <b>hunting</b> grounds. It further analyses the impact of diminishing of the minimum area of the <b>hunting</b> grounds on the economy of <b>hunting.</b> It also tries {{to find out whether}} the diminishing would lead to <b>hunting</b> rights more interwoven with the ownership of the <b>hunting</b> lands. The conducted research confirmed the existence of two types of <b>hunting</b> grounds that differ by the kind of ownership and also revenues and expenses regarding <b>hunting</b> rights in these <b>hunting</b> lands. It was further found out that the diminishing of the minimum area of the <b>hunting</b> grounds would increase the bindingness of the <b>hunting</b> rights with the ownership of the <b>hunting</b> lands. The economic impact of the diminishing of the minimum area of the <b>hunting</b> ground couldn't be unequivocally determined...|$|R

5|$|On the Penghu Islands in Taiwan, drive fishing of Bottlenose Dolphins was {{practice}}d until 1990, {{when the}} practice was outlawed by the government. Mainly Indian Ocean Bottlenose Dolphins but also common Bottlenose Dolphins were captured in these <b>hunts.</b>|$|E
5|$|Selbie {{also made}} a {{conscious}} effort to attract the wealthy classes to the railway. Stations such as Sandy Lodge (now Moor Park) were built to serve golf courses and <b>hunts</b> along the route, and horse-vans were provided at stations serving <b>hunts</b> and point to points. Two Pullman cars were introduced in 1909 on selected services between the City of London and Chesham, Aylesbury and Verney Junction for the benefit of businessmen travelling to work and theatregoers returning from London.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hunt</b> and {{his wife}} Jane had five children: artist Jane Maria <b>Hunt,</b> {{physician}} Jonathan <b>Hunt,</b> painter William Morris <b>Hunt,</b> architect Richard Morris <b>Hunt</b> and early photographer and New York attorney Leavitt <b>Hunt.</b> Following <b>Hunt's</b> death, his wife took their children to Geneva, Paris and Rome for an extended Grand Tour that stretched into a dozen years. The <b>Hunt</b> children were able to study the arts in European academies and become part of an American expatriate community in Europe. Four of <b>Hunt's</b> children returned to America. The fifth, his namesake son Jonathan, remained in Paris, where he studied medicine at the University of Paris and subsequently practiced medicine until his early death, a suicide in 1874. (Jonathan <b>Hunt's</b> son William Morris <b>Hunt</b> also committed suicide, at the Isles of Shoals in New Hampshire.) <b>Hunt's</b> nephew was Chicago architect Jarvis <b>Hunt.</b>|$|R

5|$|This tit-tyrant defends its {{territory}} only against other tit-tyrants and, {{except for the}} southernmost population, is non-migratory. The tufted tit-tyrant feeds mainly {{on a variety of}} insects that it <b>hunts</b> on or from small shrubs, typically by perch gleaning. It normally <b>hunts</b> in pairs. The breeding season varies for this bird depending on its geographical location. Two to three eggs are normally laid twice a year in a cup-shaped nest made of root fibers, grasses, and lichens and lined with small feathers. The tufted tit-tyrant is listed as a species of least concern due to its large range and population.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hunt</b> {{played a}} major role in the {{negotiations}} of the June 2008 acquisition of <b>Hunt</b> Petroleum by Fort Worth, Texas-based XTO Energy for $4.186 billion.

50|$|<b>Hunt</b> Petroleum Corporation was an {{oil and gas}} {{exploration}} and production company formed in 1950.

The primary beneficiaries of these two trusts are the two eldest children of the late H.

5|$|Both Dio and Suetonius {{agree that}} gladiatorial {{contests}} and a wild-beast hunt, the venatio, also {{took place at}} the lake area, but they again disagree on the details. Dio states this took place on the first day, with the lake covered over with planking and wooden stands erected around it, while Suetonius says the events occurred in the basin after the water had been let out. Suetonius writes that 5,000 animals were killed there in a single day. Although no record of the animals pursued in these <b>hunts</b> survives (Dio mentions <b>hunts</b> of cranes and elephants but does not give a location), larger exotic animals were popular, notably elephants, big cats and bears, though smaller game such as birds, rabbits and goats also featured.|$|E
5|$|Catches in 2007 {{amounted}} to 384 Striped Dolphins, 300 Bottlenose Dolphins, 312 Risso's Dolphins and 243 Southern Short Finned Pilot Whales, {{for a total}} of 1,239 animals. These numbers do not include dolphins or other small whale species killed using various other methods, such as offshore harpoon <b>hunts,</b> in which mainly porpoises are killed. Another 77 Bottlenose Dolphins, 8 Risso Dolphins, 5 Southern Short Finned Pilot Whales were captured for use in the entertainment industry in Japan, China, Korea, and Taiwan. The quota set by the government for the species that were targeted in drive <b>hunts</b> that year allowed for the capture of 685 Striped Dolphins, 1,018 Bottlenose Dolphins, 541 Risso's Dolphins, and 369 Southern Short Finned Pilot Whales. The quota applies to all hunting methods.|$|E
