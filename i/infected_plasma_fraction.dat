40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} seminal plasma, {{as well as}} some seminal <b>plasma</b> <b>fractions,</b> on the {{heterogeneity}} and viability of frozen-thawed ram spermatozoa was studied. Fresh and frozen sperm samples were simultaneously assessed by a routine semen-quality assay and centrifugal countercurrent distribution (CCCD) in an aqueous two-phase system analysis. All samples used for this study were obtained from Salz rams by an artificial vagina and frozen according to the Fiser method. Sperm samples, consisting of either raw or washed semen, were frozen in the presence of either whole ram seminal plasma (ASP) or> 10 kDa seminal <b>plasma</b> <b>fraction.</b> Two control samples were considered: one diluted in Fiser’s extender and an undiluted sample. Cell-membrane integrity (viability), hypoosmotic swelling (HOS) test, and sperm motility were assessed in all cases after collection, before freezing (at 5 CC), after thawing, and after removing the diluent before CCCD analysis. Our results show that sperm cell partition behavior was dependent on the sperm treatment and that the freezing-thawing process accounted for a clear loss of sperm heterogeneity and membrane integrity. These losses were less apparent when seminal plasma had been removed from semen samples before freezing. In addition, washed semen frozen in the presence of either> 10 kDa seminal <b>plasma</b> <b>fraction</b> or whole re-added seminal plasma maintained a higher rate of sperm heterogeneity and viability...|$|R

Viral load count is the amount of particular viral DNA or RNA in a blood samples. It is one of the surrogate biomarker of hepatitis.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the impact of biofield modality on hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in terms of viral load as surrogate marker. Method: The viral load assay was performed on stock human plasma samples of HBV and HCV before and after 7 days of biofield treatment using Roche COBAS® AMPLICOR analyzer according to manufacturer’s instructions. Viremia (viral DNA for HBV, RNA for HCV) was considered as surrogate marker for assessment of the impact of Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment.

Additionally, viral load count of HCV RNA in <b>infected</b> <b>plasma</b> samples was significantly reduced by 67 % in the biofield treated group as compared to control.

Recent investigations directed towards a better understanding of some of the mechanisms involved in the action of spermine and spermidine on acidfast bacteria have revealed that these compounds inhibit the growth of tubercle bacilli only if another tissue substance is present in the culture medium.
