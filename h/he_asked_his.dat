5|$|Paulet was {{something}} of an eccentric. On one occasion, while his ship was moored at Spithead, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>his</b> admiral for permission to take leave to visit London. This was refused, with the comment that Paulet could travel as far on land as he could get in his barge. Thus challenged, Paulet loaded his barge onto a cart {{and went off to}} London anyway.|$|E

5|$|Goddard had a weak {{heart and}} had never flown before, so <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>his</b> doctor, William Kirkwood, to {{accompany}} him on the trip. As Kirkwood was a resident at a maternity hospital, his presence led to false speculation that Simpson was pregnant, and even {{that she was having}} an abortion. The press excitedly reported that the solicitor had flown to Simpson accompanied by a gynaecologist and an anaesthetist (who was actually the lawyer's clerk).|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{novel was}} based on events from the childhood of the author's son, screenwriter David Paterson. When <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>his</b> mother if he could write a screenplay of the novel, she agreed {{in part because of}} his ability as a playwright. Production began in February 2006, and the film was finished by November. Principal photography was shot in Auckland, New Zealand within sixty days. Film editing took ten weeks, while post-production, music mixing, and visual effects took several months. This was Michael Chapman's last film as cinematographer before his retirement.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{licensed}} to practise {{medicine in the}} United States, he began testing the boxes on human beings diagnosed with cancer and schizophrenia. In one case the test had to be stopped prematurely because the subject heard a rumour that Reich was insane; there were stories, which were false, {{that he had been}} hospitalized in the Utica State Mental Hospital. In another case the father of an eight-year-old girl with cancer approached him for help, then complained to the American Medical Association that he was practising without a licence. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>his</b> supporters to stick with him through the criticism, believing that he had developed a grand unified theory of physical and mental health.|$|E

5|$|Australia's {{prospects}} improved after Sweden was disqualified in {{the morning}} heats. Tonelli, the eldest swimmer in the quartet {{at the age of}} 23, convened the team as its de facto leader. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>his</b> teammates to commit to swimming their legs in a certain time; Kerry vowed to complete the backstroke in 57s, Evans the breaststroke in 63s flat, Tonelli the butterfly in 54s and Brooks promised to anchor the team in 49.8s, even though he had never gone faster than 51s. Tonelli named the foursome the Quietly Confident Quartet, and they exhibited a calm self-belief as they lined up for the race.|$|E
5|$|Charles XI {{had complained}} of stomach pains since 1694. In {{the summer of}} 1696, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>his</b> doctors for an opinion on the pain as it had {{continuously}} become worse, {{but they had no}} viable cure or treatment for it. He continued to perform his duties as usual, but, in February 1697, the pains became too severe for him to cope and he returned to Stockholm where the doctors discovered he had a large, hard lump in his stomach. At this point there was little the doctors could do except alleviate the King's pain as best they could. Charles XI died on 5 April 1697, in his forty-first year. An autopsy showed that the King had developed cancer and that it had spread through his entire abdominal cavity.|$|E
5|$|For {{three months}} Braham {{remained}} inactive. In February 1944 he was posted to No. 2 Group RAF as 'wing commander night operations' {{attached to the}} 2nd Light Bomber Group, RAF Second Tactical Air Force. Although a staff officer at HQ, Braham was able, with persistence, to persuade his commanding officer, Air Vice Marshal Basil Embry {{to allow him to}} 'free-lance' intruder operations using a De Havilland Mosquito loaned from one of the various squadrons in the group on the proviso <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>his</b> permission beforehand. Braham also had his former radar operators transferred to the group's headquarters so he could fly with them. He frequently borrowed aircraft from No. 613 Squadron RAF.|$|E

5|$|In 1808, the Portuguese Royal Family {{arrived in}} Brazil, {{settling}} in Rio de Janeiro. The Hispanic-American colonies became easy prey, {{as they were}} engulfed in turmoil and beset by wars of independence against Spain. In 1811 Prince Regent Dom João (later King Dom JoãoVI) ordered {{the invasion of the}} Banda Oriental (Eastern Bank), which bordered Rio Grande do Sul. João's attempt at conquering the entire region met with failure. He launched another invasion a few years later, in 1816, who counted among their ranks Marques de Sousa's father and paternal grandfather. In 1817, around age 13, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>his</b> grandfather to allow him to fight in the war. The elder Marques de Sousa agreed, and the youngster learned guerrilla hit-and-run tactics on horseback near the border town of Jaguarão.|$|E
5|$|On January 6, 1925, Haynes, the Apperson brothers, {{and other}} {{automotive}} pioneers were awarded gold medals by the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce at a New York City auto exhibition {{for their contributions}} to the industry. On his return trip home, he contracted influenza and his health began to deteriorate rapidly. In March, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>his</b> son to take over his business interests while he traveled to Florida to seek rest in the warmer climate. His condition steadily worsened, causing him to cancel his planned trip to Cuba and return to Kokomo. He remained in his home, attended by his personal physician and a nurse until his death from congestive heart failure on April 13, 1925. Haynes' funeral was held in Kokomo before his interment at the city's Memorial Park cemetery.|$|E
5|$|The Democratic-Republican congressional caucus convened February 25, 1804. Contrary to {{previous}} conventions, the proceedings were open and formal. Afraid that taking vice presidential nominations {{from the floor}} would precipitate divisive oratory, chairman Stephen Bradley called for open balloting for the nomination. New York's George Clinton received a majority with 67 votes; Breckinridge garnered 20 votes, mostly from western delegates, and the remaining votes were scattered among 4 other candidates. Historian James C. Klotter concluded that the solons felt a ticket composed of Jefferson, a Virginian, and Breckinridge, a former Virginian, made little political sense. Breckinridge acceded to the choice; some reports hold that <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>his</b> colleagues not {{to vote for him}} at all. Before the caucus adjourned, a thirteen-man committee was formed to promote the election of the Democratic-Republican ticket; Breckinridge represented Kentucky on the committee.|$|E

5|$|When Marseille {{returned}} to his unit <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>his</b> friends Franzisket, Clade and Schröer, whether they had heard {{what was happening to}} Jews and if perhaps something was underway {{that they did not know}} about. Franszisket recalled that he had heard Jews were being relocated to territory gained in the East but no more. Marseille recounted how he had attempted to ask questions about Jews who had vanished from his neighbourhood, including the family doctor that had delivered him at birth. Regardless of his hero status, when he attempted to bring the subject into any conversation with people who approached him, his enquiries were either met with awkward silences, or people changed the subject or even turned away. Franzisket noticed a change in Marseille's attitude toward his nation's cause. He never spoke of this with his comrades again.|$|E
5|$|When Sarria {{was around}} ten years old, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>his</b> mother {{how much money}} they had in the bank. Maria, who gave her money to her {{employer}} Mr. Jost to invest, asked to see the books. She discovered that Jost had been embezzling from her and from the other women whom she had referred to him. Jost was arrested, convicted and deported. Maria sued Jost's corporate partners and received a settlement but never recovered the bulk of the money. Unable to afford her house payments, Maria moved José and the Millen family to Redwood City in 1932.|$|E
5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, both the Clacton and Skegness camps were requisitioned by the War Office for use as training camps. The ministry needed further camps, and contracted Butlin to build them. Butlin agreed, on the condition that he could purchase the sites when the war was over, to use as holiday camps. The ministry agreed, and Filey (1945), Pwllheli and Ayr (both in 1947), opened after the war. As Butlin was dealing with other sites, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>his</b> business competitor, Harry Warner, to complete the construction of Filey. Butlin had purchased his first hotel in 1939, the Thatched Barn in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. Like his camps, it was requisitioned (this time by the SOE) before he could develop it.|$|E

5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1911, a year before he was due to leave the school, Heseltine had tired of life at Eton. Without a clear plan for his future, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>his</b> mother if he could live abroad for a while. His mother wanted {{him to go to}} university, and then either into the City or the Civil Service, but she agreed to his request with the proviso that he would resume his {{education}} later. In October 1911 he proceeded to Cologne to learn German and to study piano at the conservatory. In Cologne Heseltine produced his first few songs which, like all his earliest works, were highly imitative of Delius. The piano studies went poorly, although Heseltine expanded his musical experiences by attending concerts and operas. He also experimented with general journalism, publishing an article in Railway and Travel Monthly on the subject of a disused Welsh branch line.|$|E
5|$|Falko Bindrich {{was born}} on 17 October 1990 in Zittau, Germany, to parents Zdena and Oswald Bindrich. His father, Oswald Bindrich (born 1951), was an expert-level chess player, with a highest Elo rating of 2212. In 1993, {{at the age of}} three, Falko was taught chess by his brother and soon after, his father, Oswald, {{enrolled}} him the Oberland Chess Club. In 1998, he entered for the German Youth Individual Championship (under nine) and placed 28th out of 80 participants. After achieving second place in the 1999 German Youth U10 Individual Championship, he was allowed to attend the U10 European Championship where he finished only 39th. After this disappointment, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>his</b> father, Oswald, how he could improve, and he set him on a daily training regimen with him and later consulted with stronger German players. In late 1999, he reached 1400 Elo, whereby his training sessions were extended and held with the likes of grandmasters Lubomir Ftacnik and Zigurds Lanka.|$|E
5|$|The 4100m medley relay was {{the focal}} point of Brooks' Moscow {{campaign}} and it came only two days before his 18th birthday. The event had always been won by the United States since its inception at Olympic level in 1960, and their boycott had opened up the field in the event. In the five times the event had been contested, Australia's best result was a silver in the inaugural race. A bronze in 1964 was the only other medal success and the 1976 edition of the medley relay had seen Australia eliminated in the heats. This time, Australia were regarded as a medal chance, but were not seen as the main threats; Sweden, Great Britain and the Soviet Union were the most heavily fancied teams. The hosts boasted the silver medallists in the 100m backstroke and breaststroke, and their butterflyer had come fifth; their freestyler would place fourth a few days later. The British had Duncan Goodhew, the breaststroke gold medallist, while Sweden's butterflyer and backstroker had won their respective events and their freestyle swimmer would come second in the 100m. On paper, Australia's team paled in comparison. Peter Evans was the only individual medallist over a 100m race, claiming bronze in the breaststroke. Mark Kerry had been eliminated in the backstroke semifinals, while Tonelli was swimming as a makeshift butterflyer, despite having performed better than Kerry in the 100m backstroke. Adding to the pressure was the fact that Australia won no gold medals at the 1976 Olympics in any sport, and were yet to win in Moscow, so the public were still awaiting their first victory since Munich in 1972. Coming into the Olympics, Australia were ranked seventh out of the thirteen competing countries. Australia's prospects improved after the morning heats in which Sweden was disqualified. Tonelli, the eldest swimmer in the quartet at the age of 23, convened the team as its de facto leader. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>his</b> team-mates to commit to swimming their legs in a certain time; Kerry vowed to swim the backstroke in 57s, Evans the breaststroke in 63s flat, Tonelli the butterfly in 54s and Brooks promised to anchor the team in 49.8s, even though he had never gone faster than 51s. Tonelli named the foursome as the Quietly Confident Quartet, and they exhibited a quiet confidence as they lined up for the race.|$|E
