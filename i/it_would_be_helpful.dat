Then Aristides came before the people and said of the deed which Themistocles purposed to do, that none other could be more advantageous, and none more unjust.

2500|$|The {{relationship}} between risk perception and behavior is multifaceted. [...] Risk management {{is most effective}} once the motivation behind the behavior of disposing unused pharmaceuticals is understood. [...] There was little correlation found between the perception of risk and knowledge regarding pharmaceutical waste {{according to a study}} conducted by Cook and Bellis in 2001. [...] This study cautioned against the effectiveness of attempting to change the public’s behavior on these health issues by warning them of the risks associated with their actions. [...] It is advised to take careful measures to inform the public {{in a way that does}} not impart guilt but rather public awareness. [...] For example, a study carried out by Norlund and Garvill in Sweden (2003) [...] that found that some people may make a personal sacrifice in terms of comfort because they feel that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> to reduce further environmental damage caused by the use of cars. [...] Awareness of air pollution problems was a factor in their decision to take action on a more environmentally favorable choice of transportation. [...] Thus, the goal of Bound’s project encapsulates whether the perception of risk associated with pharmaceuticals has an effect on the way in which medication is commonly disposed.|$|E

[...] Asif Chaudhry, the US ambassador, stated that [...] "the authorities acted with restraint on Tuesday, as the demonstration in front of the Presidential Palace and the Parliament building went out of control resulting in property damage and injuries. Thus, the potential for more grave consequences was avoided." [...] He also expressed concerns about the arrests that took place after the riot. United States Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton wrote to president Vladimir Voronin: [...] "As our Embassy and the Department of State noted in public statements, we condemn the violence which occurred in the days following the election.

2500|$|More recently, in 2003 air {{historian}} Andy Saunders {{wrote a book}} Bader's Last Flight, {{following up}} with a Channel 4 documentary Who Downed Douglas Bader?, which first aired on 28 August 2006. Saunders' research now suggests that Bader {{may have been a}} victim of friendly fire, shot down by one of his fellow RAF pilots after becoming detached from his own squadron. RAF combat records indicate Bader may have been shot down by Flight Lieutenant [...] "Buck" [...] Casson of No. 616 Squadron RAF, who claimed a Bf 109 whose tail came off and the pilot bailed out, before he himself was shot down and captured. Casson also mentioned that for a while he watched as the pilot struggled to bail out. Bader was flying {{at the rear of the}} German fighter formation, alone, and his squadron were the opposite side of the Germans. [...] "Buck" [...] had only a few seconds in which he saw Bader and mistook his Spitfire for a Bf 109. In a letter to Bader on 28 May 1945, Casson explained the action. While this source made it into the public domain, it was severely edited. The nature of the letter, that it was from Casson to Bader, was removed. Crucially, an entire paragraph, which mentioned specifically the tail coming off [...] "a Bf 109" [...] and the pilot struggling to get out of the cockpit, was completely omitted from the original source, still in the Casson family's possession. Saunders stated that this was not absolute proof, and that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> to find the [...] "Bader Spitfire".|$|E
2500|$|Booker is {{voiced by}} veteran voice actor Troy Baker, while Elizabeth is voiced by actress Courtnee Draper. Baker and Draper's {{participation}} in the development process was atypical for most video games; instead of just coming in to record their lines, Levine considered them as collaborators on the story development process. The three spent {{a significant amount of}} time in the recording studio, improvising scenes and working on repeated recordings to try to find the right tone to present scripted dialog; such changes were then reflected appropriately in the game's story and dialog. Levine favorably contrasted Baker and Draper as [...] "the genius and the novice" [...] respectively; Baker had several previous roles in video game voice-overs, while Draper had none; the different levels of experience between the two helped to tighten the performances, the combination a [...] "potent mix" [...] according to Levine. Levine explained one case where Draper was struggling to give a convincing tearful performance when Elizabeth is having difficulty using her powers. Both Draper and Levine believed <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>helpful</b> to have Baker provide Booker's loud, berating dialog alongside Draper to help Draper find the right emotional response to deliver for the scene. Levine considered the input of both actors of critical importance to be able to deliver a lot of information, both in words and emotion, in only a few lines of dialog. Levine also worked with the actors directly to script out specific scenes once they had gotten to know their characters before recording their voices. Despite working closely with Baker and Draper on characterization and creating dialog on the fly, Levine did not provide the actors with full knowledge of their characters' backstory or the overarching plot of the game prior to recording; according to Levine, this helped the actors to create the in-game connection between Booker and Elizabeth in a much more natural manner than reading with full knowledge of the script. Similarly, Levine has not told the developers on his team the whole story of BioShock Infinite, using the reveals to gauge their reactions and adjust the story as needed; this had created some strife in the team, as they would prefer working with full knowledge of the script, but Levine noted [...] "that's not the way we present stuff to the gamer".|$|E
