40|$|The resin-dentin {{interdiffusion}} zone {{produced by}} a dentin-adhesive system that removes the smear layer and concurrently decalcifies superficial dentin was morphologically examined by both scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Cross-sectioned resin-bonded dentin discs were etched with an argon-ion beam to make the resin-dentin interface observable by SEM. For the TEM examination, the sections were partly decalcified by an aqueous EDTA solution to facilitate ultramicrotomy and to disclose the ultrastructure of the interdiffusion zone. Both SEM and TEM confirmed {{the presence of the}} resin-dentin interdiffusion zone as the junction between the deep unaltered dentin structure and the restorative resin. Within the interdiffusion zone, three sublayers with characteristic ultrastructure and staining were identified by TEM. An upper diffuse black layer contained few structural features. Underneath, partially-altered collagen fibrils were closely packed, mostly running parallel with the interface and perpendicular to the dentinal tubules. Their outline was electron-dense, forming tunnel-like structures. At the base of the upper layer, several stained projections were found to bulge out into the underlying collagen network and appeared to be confined by obstructive, parallel-running collagen fibrils. Finally, the third dense layer, containing hydroxyapatite crystals, demarcated the superficially demineralized dentin layer from the deeper unaltered <b>dentin.</b> <b>Resin</b> diffusion into the decalcified dentin surface layer was evident, but diminished with depth, presumably reducing deeper resin impregnation into the interfibrillar spaces. The citric acid dentin-pretreatment probably caused denaturation of the superficial collagen fibrils. Its decalcifying effect gradually weakened with depth, leaving behind hydroxyapatite crystals {{at the base of the}} interdiffusion zone. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Dentin bonding {{performed}} with hydrophobic resins using ethanol-wet bonding {{should be less}} susceptible to degradation but this hypothesis has never been validated. Objectives. This in vitro study evaluated stability of resin-dentin bonds created with an experimental three-step BisGMA/TEGDMA hydrophobic adhesive or a three-step hydrophilic adhesive after one year of accelerated aging in artificial saliva. Methods. Flat surfaces in mid-coronal dentin were obtained from 45 sound human molars and randomly divided into three groups (n = 15) : an experimental three-step BisGMA/TEGDMA hydrophobic adhesive applied to ethanol (ethanol-wet bonding-GI) or water-saturated dentin (water-wet bonding-GII) and Adper Scotchbond Multi-Purpose [MP-GIII] applied, according to manufacturer instructions, to water-saturated <b>dentin.</b> <b>Resin</b> composite crowns were incrementally formed and light-cured to approximately 5 mm in height. Bonded specimens were stored in artificial saliva at 37 degrees C for 24 h and sectioned into sticks. They were subjected to microtensile bond test and TEM analysis immediately and after one year. Data were analyzed with two-way ANOVA and Tukey tests. Results. MP exhibited significant reduction in microtensile bond strength after aging (24 h: 40. 6 +/- 2. 5 (a); one year: 27. 5 +/- 3. 3 (b); in MPa). Hybrid layer degradation was evident in all specimens examined by TEM. The hydrophobic adhesive with ethanol-wet bonding preserved bond strength (24 h: 43. 7 +/- 7. 4 (a); one year: 39. 8 +/- 2. 7 (a)) and hybrid layer integrity, with the latter demonstrating intact collagen fibrils and wide interfibrillar spaces. Significance. Coaxing hydrophobic resins into acid-etched dentin using ethanol-wet bonding preserves resin-dentin bond integrity without the adjunctive use of MMPs inhibitors and warrants further biocompatibility and patient safety`s studies and clinical testing.

30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the bonding ability of a {{universal}} dental adhesive (Scotchbond Universal/SBU, 3  M ESPE) and other contemporary dental bonding agents applied to different substrates: enamel, <b>dentin,</b> <b>resin</b> composite, and porcelain. SBU was tested using both the etch-and-rinse/ER and self-etch/SE bonding approaches. The other adhesives tested were Scotchbond Multipurpose/SBMP (3  M ESPE), Single Bond 2 /SB (3  M ESPE), and Clearfil SE Bond/CLSE (Kuraray). Specimens of each substrate were prepared for microtensile bond strength test/μTBS (dentin and composite) or shear/SBS test (enamel and porcelain). In composite and porcelain, negative (no treatment) and positive (silane[*]+[*]SB) control groups were tested. Data were analyzed using One-Way ANOVA and Tukey’s test (α[*]=[*] 0.05). In enamel, SBU resulted in similar SBS (p[*]≥[*] 0.458) compared to all other adhesives (SBMP[*]=[*] 19.0 [*]±[*] 10.2 B; SB[*]=[*] 26.6 [*]±[*] 9.3 A; CLSE[*]=[*] 26.0 [*]±[*] 8.5 A; SBU-SE[*]=[*] 23.5 [*]±[*] 8.4 AB; SBU-ER[*]=[*] 22.6 [*]±[*] 9.9 AB). In dentin, SBU showed similar results to all other materials (p[*]≥[*] 0.123), except SB (p[*]≤[*] 0.045), which showed the highest μTBS (SBMP[*]=[*] 35.4 [*]±[*] 10.5 AB; SB[*]=[*] 39.4 [*]±[*] 11.2 A; CLSE[*]=[*] 36.6 [*]±[*] 10.9 AB; SB-SE[*]=[*] 28.1 [*]±[*] 13.7 B; SBU-ER[*]=[*] 26.9 [*]±[*] 7.4 B). In resin composite, SBU and the positive control presented similar μTBS (p[*]=[*] 0.963), and were higher than the negative control (p[*]≤[*] 0.001) (SBU[*]=[*] 28.4 [*]±[*] 9.9 A; positive control[*]=[*] 29.5 [*]±[*] 11.7 A; negative control[*]=[*] 12.1 [*]±[*] 8.7 B). In porcelain, SBU had higher SBS than the positive control (p[*]=[*] 0.001), which showed higher SBS (p[*]<[*] 0.001) than the negative control (SBU[*]=[*] 29.0 [*]±[*] 6.9 A; positive control[*]=[*] 21.0 [*]±[*] 7.0 B; negative control[*]=[*] 5.3 [*]±[*] 2.7 C). Equilibrium of adhesive and mixed failures occurred in dentin and resin composite, whereas a predominance of adhesive failures was observed in enamel and porcelain. In conclusion, the bonding ability of the universal adhesive was comparable to the other contemporary bonding agents tested, although it was dependent on the substrate evaluated. Universal adhesives seem to have potential applicability in adhesive dentistry.|$|E

Ninety-six bovine teeth were sectioned to expose a flat dentin surface area. A standardized cavity with 2. 0 mm in thickness, superficial diameter of 4. 0 mm and bottom diameter of 3. 0 mm was prepared with a diamond bur in each dentin specimen. The teeth were divided into four groups according to the hemostatic employed: G 1 : control; G 2 : use of ViscoStat, Ultradent; G 3 : Hemosthasegel, FGM; and G 4 : Hemostop, Dentsply. The groups were divided into two subgroups according to the cleaning protocol method (n= 12) : A: without any further cleaning; and B: cleaning with chlorhexidine at 0. 2 %. All cavities were filled using a dentin adhesive and a resin composite, following the manufacturer's instructions. After 24 h, the specimens were aged by thermal and mechanical cycling. The bond strength was determined by the push out bond test (MPa), Statistical analysis was performed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey test (p< 0. 05). Statistically significant differences were detected among all groups treated with hemostatic agents and the control group. The post-hoc test showed that cleaning the cavity with chlorhexidine significantly improves the bond strength between <b>dentin</b> and <b>resin</b> composite.

50|$|Bonding {{agents are}} often methacrylates with some {{volatile}} carrier and solvent like acetone. They may also contain diluent monomers.

Adhesive systems were applied and "crowns" were built using Z 100. Other 5 human molars were sectioned to obtain square-shaped dentin blocks and 5 resin blocks were built using a composite resin, Z 100. After storage in distilled water at 37 °C for 24 h, stick-shaped specimens were obtained for all groups (n = 5) with 0. 8 mm² and subjected to µTBS or µTS test.

40|$|Aim To {{analyze the}} {{influence}} of cavity design preparation on stress values in three-dimensional (3 D) solid model of maxillary premolar restored with resin composite. Methods 3 D solid model of maxillary second premolar was designed using computed-tomography (CT) data. Based on a factorial experiment, 9 different mesio-occlusal- distal (MOD) cavity designs were simulated, with three cavity wall thicknesses (1. 5 mm, 2. 25 mm, 3. 0 mm), and three cusp reduction procedures (without cusp reduction, 2. 0 mm palatal cusp reduction, 2. 0 mm palatal and buccal cusp reduction). All MOD cavities were simulated with direct resin composite restoration (Gradia Direct Posterior, GC, Japan). Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to calculate von Mises stress values. Results The von Mises stresses in enamel, <b>dentin,</b> and <b>resin</b> composite were 79. 3 - 233. 6 MPa, 26. 0 - 32. 9 MPa, and 180. 2 - 252. 2 MPa, respectively. Considering {{the influence of}} cavity design parameters, cuspal reduction (92. 97 %) and cavity wall thickness (3. 06 %) significantly (P < 0. 05) determined the magnitude of stress values in enamel. The influence of cavity design parameters on stress values in <b>dentin</b> and <b>resin</b> composite was not significant. When stresses for enamel, dentine, and resin composite were considered all together, palatal cusp coverage was revealed as an optimal option. Cavity wall thickness did not show {{a significant effect on}} stress values. Conclusion Based on numerical simulations, a palatal cusp reduction could be suggested for revealing lower stress values in dental tissues and restorative material. This type of cavity design should contribute to better biomechanical behavior of tooth-restoration complex, consequently providing the long-lasting clinical results...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{fluoride}} for {{the prevention}} of caries is based on the transformation of hydroxylapatite to fluoroapatite in the presence of fluoride ions, thereby strengthening tooth structure. Adhesion of <b>dentin</b> and <b>resin</b> composite (tooth-colored restoration material) requires a dentin bonding system, since resin composite is not able to adhere to dentin directly. Demineralization of dentin by acid etching is an important step in the dentin bonding system; however, demineralization also introduces weaknesses in tooth structure. If the demineralized dentin could be strengthened by the application of fluoride, then the dentin-resin composite bond strength might also improve. To test this hypothesis, the present study evaluated the influence of fluoride applications on the strength of the dentin-resin composite bond by (1) tensile strength testing analyses, (2) SEM analyses of tooth structure, and (3) detection of calcium (Ca) and fluorine (F) distribution patterns by micro proton-induced X-ray emission (μ-PIXE) and micro proton-induced gamma emission (μ-PIGE) analyses conducted at the Takasaki Ion Accelerators for Advanced Radiation Application (TIARA) at the Takasaki Advanced Radiation Research Institute (TARRI). In this study, the dentin in extracted human molars was exposed by grinding and the dentin was etched with 35 % phosphoric acid. Fluoride was applied at two concentrations, 0. 022 % (100 ppmF) and 2. 21 % (10, 000 ppmF) NaF solution, for two time periods, 30 s and 60 s, prior to bonding the resin composite with the treated dentin. Controls were prepared in the same manner, but without the fluoride application. Bond strength was measured with a micro-tensile testing unit, and the fluorine and calcium distributions at the interface between <b>dentin</b> and <b>resin</b> composite were detected by μ-PIGE and μ-PIXE analysis, respectively. Results indicate that the 10, 000 ppmF applications resulted in higher bond strengths than observed in either the 100 ppmF applications or the control group. In addition, PIGE analyses showed high concentrations of fluorine in the hybrid bonding layer of the 10, 000 ppmF samples, suggesting that the fluorine contributes to the strength of the dentin-resin composite bond.

The surface roughness values were measured by the non-contact three-dimensional morphology scanner, then the surface micromorphologies of surfaces in all groups were assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM); meanwhile, Image Pro-Plus 6. 0 software was used to measure the relative percentage of open tubules on SEM images. The rest, one hundred twenty-eight teeth for bond strength test, were divided into eight groups according to the different treatments (A: only treated with the adhesive Adper Easy One, B: diamond bur polishing followed by the above adhesive, C-H: Er,Cr:YSGG laser irradiating at 1 W, 2 W, 3 W, 4 W, 5 W, 6 W output power, respectively, followed by the above adhesive), and each group was subsequently divided into two subgroups according to whether aging is performed (immediately tested and after thermocycling). Micro-shear bond strength test was used to evaluate the bond strength. The 4 W laser group showed the highest roughness value (30. 84 ± 1. 93 μm), which was statistically higher than the control group and the diamond bur groups (p< 0. 05). The mean percentages ((27. 8 ± 1. 8) %, (28. 0 ± 2. 2) %, (30. 0 ± 1. 9) %) of open tubules area in the 4 W, 5 W, 6 W group were higher than other groups (p< 0. 05).

Resin cements were applied to 2 -mm-thick, precured resin composite disks (Z 250, 3 M ESPE), which were fixed to dentin surfaces containing adhesive resin in either cured (light cured; LC) or uncured (self-cured; SC) states. The restored teeth were light activated (XL 3000, 3 M ESPE) according to the manufacturers' instructions (LRC) or allowed to self-cure (SRC), were stored for 24 h, and then vertically, serially sectioned into 1 -mm-thick slabs, which were analyzed using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Fluorescent additives indicated where individual components of the bonding/cement systems were located.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that a resin coating {{can serve as a}} means to protect dental structure after preparation of the tooth for indirect restorations, sealing the exposed <b>dentin.</b> The <b>resin</b> coating is applied on the cut surfaces immediately after tooth preparation and before making an impression by assembling a dentin bonding system and a flowable composite. Resin coatings minimize pulp irritation and improve the bond strength between a resin cement and tooth when bonding the restoration to tooth. Recently, thin-film coating dental materials based on all-in-one adhesive technology were introduced for resin coating of indirect restorations. The thin coating materials are applied in a single clinical step and create a barrier-like film layer on the prepared dentin. The thin coatings {{play an important role in}} protecting the dentin from physical, chemical, and biological irritation. In addition, these thin-film coating materials reportedly prevent marginal leakage beneath inlays or crown restorations. In light of the many benefits provided by such a protective layer, these all-in-one adhesive materials may therefore also have the potential to cover exposed root dentin surfaces and prevent caries formation. In this paper, recent progress of the dental coating materials and their clinical applications are reviewed...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the shear bond strengths of pre- and untreated resin core materials to lithium disilicate ceramics. Bond strengths to dental hard tissues served as controls. Ceramic cubes (IPS-Empress 2) were luted either with a one-step (Variolink II/Excite DSC) or multiple-step total etching bonding system (Tetric Flow/Syntac Classic) to ground surfaces of human enamel, <b>dentin,</b> and <b>resin</b> core materials (Clearfil Core, MultiCore). Resin core materials were additionally pretreated with hydrofluoric acid (HF) or were silica-coated (CoJet System). Shear bond strengths were determined after 24 -hour water storage (n= 10) and thermocycling (TC) (n= 10; 2000 cycles, 5  55 °C, 30 seconds). Bond strengths to enamel, dentin, and silica-coated composites were significantly higher compared to untreated and HF-pretreated composites (p< 0. 05; Tukey B). Silica coating of the composite resins significantly increased the bond strength to ceramics (p< 0. 05; Tukey B). Due to the lower bond strength values of ceramics to untreated composite resins (as compared to enamel and dentin), any indication for a resin core build-up prior to the preparation of a ceramic restoration should be considered carefully...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the existence of}} potential water-filled channels in resin-dentin interfaces of some single-step, self-etch adhesives. METHODS: In Experiment I, Prompt L-Pop (3 M ESPE) or an experimental adhesive RZ II (Sun Medical) were bonded to hydrated dentin and then coupled with a light-cured composite that was light-activated immediately upon application. In Experiment II, RZ II and FuturaBond (Voco) were similarly bonded to hydrated <b>dentin.</b> Unfilled <b>resins</b> were coupled in the dark to the bonded dentin using the chemical-cured mode, or light-cured mode with a 20 -minute delay before light-activation. Bonded assemblies were challenged with ammoniacal silver nitrate as a tracer and examined with transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: In Experiment I, two types of silver patterns were observed within adhesive layers and hybrid layers: interconnecting reticular, finger-like and tree-like patterns that were collectively named "water trees", and discrete silver grains. In Experiment II, apart from the patterns described above, silver-filled water blisters were also observed between the adhesive and the unfilled coupling resin in RZ II. They were linked to the pre-existing "water trees" in the adhesive layers via multiple, short water bridges. In FuturaBond, similar blisters were located between the first adhesive layer and the second adhesive layer that was light-activated after placement of the coupling resin. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aim: An {{important}} {{purpose of}} adhesive dentistry is restriction of cavity preparation to carious dentin removal and conservation of sound dentin. Application of caries disclosing agents and cavity disinfectants can help achieving this goal. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the effect of caries disclosing agents and cavity disinfectants on microleakage of composite resin restorations. Materials and Methods: This experimental in-vitro study was performed on class V cavities in 48 extracted human sound premolars. The teeth were randomly divided into four equal groups. In group 1 caries detector dye (Seek, Ultradent, USA) and in group 2 cavity disinfectant (Consepsis, Ultradent, USA) were applied on dentinal surfaces. In group 3 both mentioned materials were applied. Group 4 was considered as control group. PQ 1 bonding agent and Amelogen composite were used to restore the cavities. Gingival microleakage was assessed by dye penetration. Data were analyzed by Kruskall Wallis and Dunn tests. P&lt; 0. 05 was the level of significance. Results: Group 2 showed the least and group 4 showed the highest microleakage;however no statistical significant difference was found among the groups. Conclusion: The use of caries disclosing agent (Seek) and cavity disinfectant (Consepsis Liquid) did not adversely affect the sealing ability of <b>dentin</b> bonding <b>resins...</b>|$|R
40|$|Aim : This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effect of three cavity disinfectants (chlorhexidine gluconate based-Consepsis; benzalkonium chloride-based Tubulicid Red, iodine-potassium iodide/copper-sulphate based Ora- 5) on the microleakage of a dentin bonding system, Clearfil SE Bond. Materials and Methods : Class V cavities were prepared on 45 extracted molars. The respective experimentalgroups were treated with cavity disinfectants and Clearfil SE Bond. Preparations without cavity disinfectants served as negative control and those with neither disinfectant nor <b>dentin</b> bonding <b>resin</b> application served as positive controls. After the cavity preparations were restored with resin composite (Clearfil APX), the specimens were subjected to dye penetration. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA (Kruskal-Wallis) test. Results : Unlike Conspesis and Tubulicid Red, Ora- 5 exhibited significantly higher microleakage and adversely affected the sealing ability of Clearfil SE bond. Only Consepsis and Tubulicid Red could be used as cavity disinfectants with Clearfil SE bond, without its sealing abilities being adversely affected. Conclusions : 1) Consepsis and Tubulicid Red can be used as cavity disinfectants with Clearfil SE Bond, without the sealing ability of Clearfil SE bond being affected. 2) Ora- 5 is not an appropriate disinfectant to be used with this dentin bonding system, because it alters its sealing ability...|$|R
40|$|The resin-dentin {{interface}} {{formed by}} two dentin adhesives, Optibond (OPTI, Kerr) and Scotchbond Multi-Purpose (SBMP, 3 M), was ultramorphologically examined by {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM). Ultrastructural information from nondemineralized and demineralized sections was correlated. It was hypothesized that the different chemical formulations of the two adhesives {{would result in a}} different morphological appearance of the hybrid layer. Ultrastructural TEM examination proved that each of the two dentin adhesive systems was able to establish a micromechanical bond between <b>dentin</b> and <b>resin</b> with the formation of a hybrid layer. However, the interfacial hybridization process that took place to produce this resin-dentin bond appeared to be specifically related to the chemical composition and application modes of both systems. OPTI consistently presented with a hybrid layer with a relatively uniform ultrastructure, electron density, and acid resistance. These three parameters were found to be more variable for the hybrid layer formed by SBMP. Characteristic of SBMP was the identification of an amorphous phase deposited at the outer surface of the hybrid layer. Although both adhesive systems investigated follow a total-etch concept, their specific chemical formulations result in different interfacial ultrastructures that are probably related to different underlying bonding mechanisms. The clinical significance of these morphological findings, however, is still unknown. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} {{nature of}} the interface between <b>dentin</b> and adhesive <b>resin</b> materials was characterized by micro-Raman spectroscopy. The resulting chemical profiles were correlated with photomicrographs obtained by SEM after an argon-ion-beam etching treatment of the sample surface. Two commercially available dentin adhesive systems, of which one was also applied with a different conditioning agent, were investigated. Raman spectra, which were recorded along line scans across the interface with a step increment of 1 micron, revealed that resin effectively penetrated 4 to 6 microns deep into the superficially decalcified dentin zone. Across the interface, a gradual transition from <b>resin</b> to <b>dentin</b> over the interdiffusion zone with a mixed contribution of both substances was noticed. Finally, resin appeared to penetrate to the entire decalcification depth of dentin regardless of the aggressiveness of the conditioning procedure. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the presence of}} non-infiltrated, partially demineralized dentin (PDD) beneath the hybrid layer for self-etch adhesive systems, {{and its effect on}} micromechanical behavior of dentin-adhesive interfaces (DAIs). This in-vitro laboratory and computer simulation study hypothesized that the presence of non-infiltrated PDD beneath the hybrid layer does not influence the mechanical behavior of the DAI of self-etch adhesive systems. Methods: Fifteen sound third molars were restored with composite resin using three adhesive systems: Scotchbond Multipurpose (SBMP), Clearfil SE Bond (CSEB) and Adper Promp L-Pop (APLP). The thickness and length of all DAIs were assessed using scanning electron microscopy, and used to generate three-dimensional finite element models. Elastic moduli of the hybrid layer, adhesive layer, intertubular dentin, peritubular <b>dentin</b> and <b>resin</b> tags were acquired using a nano-indenter. Finite element software was used to determine the maximum principal stress. Mixed models analysis of variance was used to verify statistical differences (P < 0. 05). Results: Elastic moduli and morphology were found to differ between the adhesive systems, as well as the presence and extension of PDD. Significance: Both self-etch adhesive systems (APLP and CSEB) had PDD. The DAI stress levels were higher for the one-step self-etch adhesive system (APLP) compared with the etch-and-rinse adhesive system (SBMP) and the self-etch primer system (CSEB).

40|$|Aims and Objectives : This {{study was}} done to {{characterize}} the surface chemistry after caries excavation with burs and Carisolv 2, by analyzing the relative amounts of organic and inorganic content, and also to analyze the penetration of the adhesive after etching and bonding using Micro Raman spectroscopy. Materials and Methods : Twenty extracted molars with caries were distributed into the following groups and treated accordingly. Group 1 -excavation with bur (10 teeth), and Group 2 -excavation using Carisolv 2 (10 teeth). Results and Conclusion : Spectroscopic analysis showed {{that there was no}} significant difference in the chemical composition of the tooth between the groups after excavation (P > 0. 05) either with bur or with Carisolv. The penetration of the <b>dentin</b> bonding <b>resin</b> in all samples of the Carisolv group was up to 15 &# 956;m, whereas, in the bur group it was upto 10 &# 956;m in few samples. Scanning Electron Microscopic analysis showed the surfaces of the Carisolv-treated dentin to be free of the smear layer, with open tubules, whereas, the dentin surfaces of the bur group showed surfaces covered with a smear layer. In the Carislov group the resin tags were found comparatively deeper than in the bur excavation group.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} effects of wet and dry conditions of phosphoric acid etched <b>dentin</b> on <b>resin</b> bonding and determined the optimum moisture condition for resin bonding using an ethanol-based one-bottle adhesive system. Bovine dentin surfaces were etched with 35 % phosphoric acid and rinsed with water. Under four wet and dry conditions (overwet, blot dry, one-second dry and desiccated), resin composite was bonded using Single Bond. Tensile bond strength was measured and the results analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Fisher's PLSD test at the 5 % level. The resin-dentin interfaces of bonded specimens were observed with SEM. The bond strength of overwet, blot dry, one-second dry and desiccated groups were 5. 2 MPa, 12. 6 MPa, 11. 9 MPa and 4. 4 Mpa, respectively. The blot dry group and one-second dry groups revealed significantly higher bond strengths than the desiccated and overwet groups (p< 0. 05). The formation of hybrid layers approximately 5 μm thick (overwet and blot dry), 2 pm (one-second dry) and 3 μm (desiccated) were observed. The coefficient of variation in the blot dry group was very high, even though a higher mean was observed. In the one-second dry group, the moisture content of the collagen network was possibly too low, such that hybrid layer formation was not as good even though the bond strength was high. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the effect of remaining dentin thickness and the use of a 20 % polyalkenoic acid conditioner on the micro-tensile bond strength of a glass-ionomer adhesive to <b>dentin.</b> METHODS: <b>Resin</b> composite was bonded to flat dentin surfaces from 14 extracted human teeth using Fuji BOND LC (GC) with or without a polyalkenoic acid conditioner, then sectioned to thin slabs, trimmed into an hourglass shape with the area of the interface being approximately 1 mm(2), and subjected to micro-tensile testing at a cross-head speed of 1 mm/min. Micro-tensile bond strengths were determined at three depth levels with a remaining dentin thickness of more than 3 mm, between 2 and 3 mm, and less than 2 mm. Failure modes of the broken interfaces were determined using field-emission scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: The micro-tensile bond strength to dentin significantly improved when the remaining dentin thickness increased and the conditioner was used. When the conditioner was used (irrespective of remaining dentin thickness), failures mainly occurred adhesively at the interface between the adhesive and resin composite. When no conditioner was used, no adhesive failures between the adhesive and resin composite occurred, but failures occurred mainly adhesively between dentin and the adhesive, or mixed adhesive-cohesively. SIGNIFICANCE: The bonding effectiveness of the glass-ionomer adhesive tested was affected by the area of intertubular dentin available for micro-mechanical retention through hybrid-layer formation. Removal of the smear layer improved the bond strength of the adhesive to dentin. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} two surface treatments, aging, and two resin cements on shear bond strength between dentin and yttrium-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystal ceramic (Y-TZP). Materials and Methods: Eighty human molars were embedded in acrylic resin and sectioned 3 mm below the occlusal plane. These teeth and 80 cylindrical Y-TZP specimens (height, 4 mm; diameter, 3. 4 mm) were divided into eight groups (n= 10) using the following factors: Y-TZP surface treatment (Vi: low-fusing porcelain [vitrification] + hydrofluoric acid etching + silanization or Si: tribochemical silicatization); cementation strategies (PF: Pan avia or CC: Clearfil); and storage (nonaging or aging). Bonding surfaces of 40 Y-TZP specimens received Vi treatment, and the rest received Si treatment. Half of the ceramic-tooth assemblies were cemented with Panavia, the rest with Clearfil. Shear tests were executed using 0. 4 -mm-thick wire at 0. 5 mm/min. Data were analyzed by three-way analysis of variance and Tukey test (alpha= 0. 05). Fractures were analyzed. Results: Y-TZP surface treatments did not affect bond strength (p= 0. 762, Vi = Si), while resin cements (p Clearfil) and aging (p= 0. 006, nonaging > aging) showed a significant effect. Most failures were in adhesive at dentin-cement interfaces; no failure occurred between zirconia and cement. Conclusion: When Y-TZP ceramic is bonded to dentin, the weakest interface is that between <b>dentin</b> and <b>resin</b> cement. The resin cement/Y-TZP interface was less susceptible to failures, owing to Y-TZP surface treatments...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} {{and compare the}} microleakage of self-etch adhesives placed under different clinical techniques and to analyze the resin-dentin interfacial ultrastructure under scanning electron microscope (SEM). Materials and Methods: 100 extracted human premolars {{were divided into two}} groups for different adhesives (Clearfil S 3 and Xeno III). Class V cavities were prepared. Each group was further divided into four subgroups (n = 10) according to the placement technique of the adhesive, i. e. according to manufacturer′s directions (Group 1), with phosphoric acid etching of enamel margins (Group 2), with hydrophobic resin coat application (Group 3), with techniques of both groups 2 and 3 (Group 4). The cavities were restored with composite. Ten samples from each group were subjected to microleakage study. Five samples each of both the adhesives from groups 1 and 3 were used for SEM examination of the micromorphology of the resin-dentin interface. Results: At enamel margins for both the adhesives tested, groups 2 and 4 showed significantly lesser leakage than groups 1 and 3. At dentin margins, groups 3 and 4 depicted significantly reduced leakage than groups 1 and 2 for Xeno III. SEM observation of the resin-dentin interfaces revealed generalized gap and poor resin tag formation in both the adhesives. Xeno III showed better interfacial adaptation when additional hydrophobic resin coat was applied. Conclusions: In enamel, prior phosphoric acid etching reduces microleakage of self-etch adhesives, while in <b>dentin,</b> hydrophobic <b>resin</b> coating over one-step self-etch adhesives decreases the microleakage...|$|R
