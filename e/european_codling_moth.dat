40|$|The codling moth, Cydia pomonella {{is a major}} pest in most {{pome fruit}} {{orchards}} worldwide. Recently, under the selective pressure caused by {{an increasing number of}} chemical treatments the codling moth has progressively developed a reduced insecticide susceptibility primarily to organophosphates (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors), and to insect growth regulators (chitin synthesis inhibitors). Small-scale field trials along with bioassays and biochemical or molecular tests are often exploit to reveal the selection of resistance mechanisms in field, such as target site insensibility and enhanced detoxifying activities. In this vein direct AChE- 1 gene sequencing and biochemical analysis (EST, GST and MFO activities) were performed in codling moth populations collected in several Emilia Romagna orchards having pest control difficulties. In all analysed populations, the reduced susceptibility to insecticide treatments seems mainly associated to an increased MFO activity while GST and EST detoxifying pathways are more rarely involved. Moreover electrophoretic profiles, show that EST isoforms may be detected in some OP resistant population. These differences may also occur in GST and MFO families, for which there are no currently available rapid qualitative test. It must be stressed that none of the examined populations possess target-site mutations within AChE- 1 sequence. The prevalent metabolic profile emerging from our analyses results in agreement with that found in other <b>European</b> <b>codling</b> <b>moth</b> populations with a reduced susceptibility to pesticide treatments based on alternate use of organophosphates and IGR. Trials were carried out to evaluate the correlations between the laboratory results and the field responses of two codling moth populations...|$|E

40|$|The <b>Codling</b> <b>moth</b> granulovirus (Cydia pomonella granulovirus, CpGV, Baculoviridae) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} bio control agents of the <b>codling</b> <b>moth</b> in apple production. Since 2003, <b>codling</b> <b>moth</b> populations have been observed in Germany and France, which show an up to thousand fold decreased susceptibility to CpGV. A spread of this phenomenon is a severe threat to the efficient control of the <b>codling</b> <b>moth,</b> particularly in organic farming. In order to prevent this development, investigations on the popula-tion genetics of <b>codling</b> <b>moth</b> populations in Germany were initiated to assess the baseline susceptibilities of selected populations. Furthermore, the genetic and biologi-cal background of resistance of the <b>codling</b> <b>moth</b> to CpGV are being elucidated by crossing susceptible and low susceptible <b>codling</b> <b>moth</b> populations. These investiga-tions will help to develop new control strategies or to restore high susceptibility to-wards CpGV. Mapping of traits involved in resistance will be performed. Involved loci will be identi-fied with the help of amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). Loci coupled with susceptibility can help to elucidate resistance mechanisms. Analysis of comple-mentary DNA amplified fragment length polymorphism (cDNA-AFLP) will be per-formed to display differences in expression rate of particular genes. If there are differ-ences between sensitive and non-sensitive strains, the genes will be isolated and sequenced.

40|$|This {{study focused}} on {{conservation}} biological control of pear psylla, Cacopsylla pyricola, in the Pacific Northwest, USA. We hypothesized that insecticides applied against the primary insect pest, <b>codling</b> <b>moth</b> Cydia pomonella, negatively impact natural enemies of pear psylla, thus causing outbreaks of this secondary pest. Hence, {{the objective of this}} study was to understand how <b>codling</b> <b>moth</b> management influences the abundance of pear psylla and its natural enemy complex in pear orchards managed under long-term <b>codling</b> <b>moth</b> mating disruption programs. We conducted this study within a pear orchard that had previously been under seasonal mating disruption for <b>codling</b> <b>moth</b> for eight years. We replicated two treatments, “natural enemy disrupt” (application of two combination sprays of spinetoram plus chlorantraniliprole timed against first-generation <b>codling</b> <b>moth)</b> and “natural enemy non-disrupt” four times in the orchard. Field sampling of psylla and natural enemies (i. e., lacewings, coccinellids, spiders, Campylomma verbasci, syrphid flies, earwigs) revealed that pear psylla populations remained well below treatment thresholds all season despite the reduced abundance of key pear psylla natural enemies in the natural enemy disrupt plots compared with the non-disrupt treatment. We speculate that pear psylla are difficult to disrupt when pear orchards are under long-term <b>codling</b> <b>moth</b> disruption...|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} {{biological}} control of <b>codling</b> <b>moth</b> is {{the application of}} <b>codling</b> <b>moth</b> granulosis virus (CMGV) in a water based formulation including the granulosis virus, Occlusion Bodies (OBs).

40|$|The <b>codling</b> <b>moth</b> (Cydia pomonella,L.) is {{the most}} serious pest of pears in the Goulburn Valley {{irrigation}} area. In the Shepparton, Kyabram, and Ardmona districts, there are approximately 3500 acres of Williams Pon Chretien pears grown principally for canning purposes. For some years past, the losses of pears due to the <b>codling</b> <b>moth</b> have been considerable. In 1936 it was estimated, by executives of the Northern Victoria Fruitgrowers' Association, that <b>codling</b> <b>moth</b> losses accounted for as much as 20 % of the total pear crop from the area, that is, a loss of at least � 20, 000 per annum was being experienced by the industry. No investigation of the <b>codling</b> <b>moth</b> had ever been conducted in the Goulburn Valley; and, although a considerable amount of research had been done elsewhere on the control of the pest in apples, little information was available on combatting the <b>codling</b> <b>moth</b> in pears. Ward (1936) conducted a survey of the pear-growing districts of the Goulburn Valley and found that there was a complete lack of uniformity among growers as to the control measures being used against the <b>codling</b> <b>moth.</b> Having no precise information on the seasonal activity of the pest, growers were not In a position to apply their sprays at the correct time, nor was there an efficient spray schedule in general use.
