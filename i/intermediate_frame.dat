50|$|Influenced by {{aerodynamicist}} Paul Jaray, {{the hull}} shape was more streamlined than the preceding P class, although traditionalists {{in the company}} insisted that {{a portion of the}} hull should be parallel sided to prevent instability. The structure consisted of 20 wire braced 13-sided transverse frames, all but the rear three and front two frames made up of kingpost-braced girders.

The transverse frames were connected by 13 principal longitudinal girders, of which the one at the top of the hull was a more substantial W-section girder. There were secondary longitudinal girders between the principal girders. A central axial bracing cable running the length of the hull was fitted to reduce the load on the transverse bracing of the mainframes in the case of the deflation of a single gasbag.

Our method preserves the robustness and accuracy of image stitchers that match all pairs of images while utilizing the ordering information provided by video.

Key frames are matched to all other key <b>frames,</b> but <b>intermediate</b> video <b>frames</b> are only matched to temporally neighboring key <b>frames</b> and <b>intermediate</b> <b>frames.</b> Image orientations can be estimated from this sparse set of matches in time quadratic to cubic in the number of key frames but only linear in the number of <b>intermediate</b> <b>frames.</b> Additionally, the matches between pairs of images are compressed by replacing measurements within small windows in the image with a single representative measurement.

40|$|Given two {{consecutive}} frames, video interpolation aims at generating intermediate frame(s) to form both spatially and temporally coherent video sequences. While most existing methods focus on single-frame interpolation, we propose an end-to-end {{convolutional neural network}} for variable-length multi-frame video interpolation, where the motion interpretation and occlusion reasoning are jointly modeled. We start by computing bi-directional optical flow between the input images using a U-Net architecture. These flows are then linearly combined at each time step to approximate the intermediate bi-directional optical flows. These approximate flows, however, only work well in locally smooth regions and produce artifacts around motion boundaries. To address this shortcoming, we employ another U-Net to refine the approximated flow and also predict soft visibility maps. Finally, the two input images are warped and linearly fused to form each <b>intermediate</b> <b>frame.</b> By applying the visibility maps to the warped images before fusion, we exclude the contribution of occluded pixels to the interpolated <b>intermediate</b> <b>frame</b> to avoid artifacts. Since none of our learned network parameters are time-dependent, our approach is able to produce as many intermediate frames as needed. We use 1, 132 video clips with 240 -fps, containing 300 K individual video frames, to train our network. Experimental results on several datasets, predicting different numbers of interpolated frames, demonstrate that our approach performs consistently better than existing methods.
