Tire inflation pressures have also been found to be important variables <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> <b>of</b> a motorcycle at high speeds. Because the front and rear tires can have different slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer. Of the two, understeer, in which the front wheel slides more than the rear wheel, is more dangerous since front wheel steering is critical for maintaining balance.|$|E

25|$|In this condition, {{the child}} is allowed to engage {{with a variety of}} items during the session. No demands are placed on the child {{throughout}} the duration of the session. The experimenter provides attention to the individual throughout the session on any behavior that is not the target behavior. If the target behavior occurs, the experimenter removes attention until the behavior has subsided. This session is meant to act as a control condition, meaning that the environment is enriched for the purpose of the behavior not occurring. Said another way, by meeting environmental needs for all possible functions, the individual is not likely to engage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> <b>of</b> interest. This condition is used as a comparison to the other conditions. Any condition that is elevated to a large degree form the control condition, shows a higher degree experimental control indicating the functional relationship between the specific environmental conditions and the behavior of interest.|$|E
500|$|The {{large scale}} use of {{insecticides}} in agricultural crops effectively controlled the pest {{until it became}} resistant to DDT in 1952 and dieldrin in 1958. Insecticides remain the main method of pest control on commercial farms. However, many chemicals are often unsuccessful when used against this pest because of the beetle's ability to rapidly develop insecticide resistance. Different populations in different geographic regions have, between them, developed resistance to all major classes of insecticide, although not every population is resistant to every chemical. The species {{as a whole has}} evolved resistance to 56 different chemical insecticides.

Nicknamed the [...] "Flying Bedsteads", they simulated the Moon's one-sixth of Earth's gravity by using a turbofan engine to support the remaining five-sixths of the craft's weight. On May 6, 1968, about 100feet (30m) above the ground, Armstrong's controls started to degrade and the LLTV began banking. He ejected safely (later analysis suggested {{that if he had}} ejected half a second later, his parachute would not have opened in time). His only injury was from biting his tongue.

500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of Irish phonology is that almost all consonants come in pairs, with one having a [...] "broad" [...] pronunciation and the other a [...] "slender" [...] one. Broad consonants are either velarized (that is, the back of the tongue is pulled back and slightly up {{in the direction of the}} soft palate while the consonant is being articulated) or simply velar (e.g. [...] ). Slender consonants are palatalized, which means the tongue is pushed up toward the hard palate during the articulation. The contrast between broad and slender consonants is crucial in Irish, because the meaning of a word can change if a broad consonant is substituted for a slender consonant or vice versa. For example, the only difference in pronunciation between the words [...] ('cow') and [...] ('alive') is that [...] is pronounced with a broad b sound, while [...] is pronounced with a slender b sound. The contrast between broad and slender consonants plays a critical role not only in distinguishing the individual consonants themselves, but also in the pronunciation of the surrounding vowels, in the determination of which consonants can stand next to which other consonants, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>behavior</b> <b>of</b> words that begin with a vowel. This broad/slender distinction is similar to the hard/soft one of several Slavic languages, like Russian.|$|E
