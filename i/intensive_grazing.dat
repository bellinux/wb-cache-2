25|$|The {{forests of}} Anticosti Island are typical boreal forest, with common {{species such as}} white spruce, balsam fir, and black spruce. It is {{distinguished}} by some minor stands of American white birch and trembling aspen. Balsam fir is slowly being replaced with white spruce because of <b>intensive</b> <b>grazing</b> done by deer and by periodic outbreaks of hemlock looper and spruce budworm. About {{a quarter of the}} island is covered by peat lands.|$|E
25|$|Holt {{attempted}} grazing, {{first with}} sheep {{which had to}} be destroyed when they became infected with footrot, and then with cattle. The land on his estate was not suited for <b>intensive</b> <b>grazing,</b> so after most of the trees were felled, herds of cattle then removed the stabilizing grass cover and exposed the sand dunes underneath. Large expanses of sand had been exposed along the coastline. The dune system that covers an area of , measuring 40 meters above and 90 meters below sea level, became unstable and began to move north at a rate of 8 meters a year. Land clearing and cattle grazing resulted in a degraded landscape, but created the distinctive Cronulla sand dunes of today.|$|E
25|$|The heath and its {{surrounding}} area belong to those regions of the North German Plain in which the hunter culture of the Mesolithic era was superseded quite early on by Neolithic farmers. By about 3000 BC, during the Neolithic, large open areas appeared on the lightly undulating, sandy stretches of geest on Lüneburg Heath. This {{was a result of}} the <b>intensive</b> <b>grazing</b> of the sessile oak woods and the associated destruction of successive new stands of trees. These open areas became dominated by the common heather (Calluna vulgaris), a largely grazing-resistant species of plant. Nevertheless, oak and beech woods succeeded time and again in establishing themselves wherever man left areas of heath untended. Over {{a long period of time}} the region of Lüneburg Heath alternated between periods when the heathlands spread and dominated the scene and times when it was largely covered with forest and only small areas of heath existed. Finally, after the migration period, the wooded areas of the region increased considerably.|$|E
50|$|Although milk yields {{are often}} lower in MIRG systems, net farm income per cow is often greater as {{compared}} to confinement operations. This {{is due to the}} additional costs associated with herd health and purchased feeds are greatly reduced in management <b>intensive</b> rotational <b>grazing</b> systems. Additionally, a transition to management <b>intensive</b> rotational <b>grazing</b> is associated with low start-up and maintenance costs.

25|$|The vaquero, the Spanish or Mexican cowboy {{who worked}} with young, untrained horses, arrived in the 18th century and flourished in California and {{bordering}} territories during the Spanish Colonial period. Settlers from the United States did not enter California until after the Mexican-American War, and most early settlers were miners rather than livestock ranchers, leaving livestock-raising largely to the Spanish and Mexican people who chose to remain in California. The California vaquero or buckaroo, unlike the Texas cowboy, was considered a highly skilled worker, who usually stayed on the same ranch {{where he was born}} or had grown up and raised his own family there. In addition, the geography and climate of much of California was dramatically different from that of Texas, allowing more <b>intensive</b> <b>grazing</b> with less open range, plus cattle in California were marketed primarily at a regional level, without the need (nor, until much later, even the logistical possibility) to be driven hundreds of miles to railroad lines. Thus, a horse- and livestock-handling culture remained in California and the Pacific Northwest that retained a stronger direct Spanish influence than that of Texas. The modern distinction between vaquero and buckaroo within American English may also reflect the parallel differences between the California and Texas traditions of western horsemanship.|$|E
500|$|Chudleigh lies [...] west of Launceston and [...] east of Mole Creek in {{northern}} Tasmania, Australia. The town {{is in the}} fertile Chudleigh Valley that is bounded by the Gog and Magog ranges, to the north, [...] and the Great Western Tiers, to the south-west. The town itself is {{just south of the}} Lobster rivulet, a tributary of the Mersey river which also runs near the town to the north. The land around the town is mostly suited to grazing, <b>intensive</b> <b>grazing</b> in some areas, though some is marginal cropping land that requires careful crop rotation interspersed with seasons where the land is left fallow. The hills of the area have prominent basalt, limestone and dolerite depending on location. The fertile flats are of alluvial origin with Permian era sediments that have formed mudstone and sandstone. Some areas are notably frosty in winter and experience occasional snowfall.|$|E
500|$|The ruff is a migratory species, {{breeding}} in wetlands in colder {{regions of}} northern Eurasia, and spends the northern {{winter in the}} tropics, mainly in Africa. Some Siberian breeders undertake an annual round trip of up to [...] to the West African wintering grounds. There is a limited overlap of the summer and winter ranges in western Europe. The ruff breeds in extensive lowland freshwater marshes and damp grasslands. It avoids barren tundra and areas badly affected by severe weather, preferring hummocky marshes and deltas with shallow water. The wetter areas provide a source of food, the mounds and slopes {{may be used for}} leks, and dry areas with sedge or low scrub offer nesting sites. A Hungarian study showed that moderately <b>intensive</b> <b>grazing</b> of grassland, with more than one cow per hectare (2.5acres), was found to attract more nesting pairs. When not breeding, the birds use a wider range of shallow wetlands, such as irrigated fields, lake margins, and mining subsidence and other floodlands. Dry grassland, tidal mudflats and the seashore are less frequently used. The density can reach 129 individuals per square kilometre (334 per square mile), but is usually much lower.|$|E

2500|$|Giardia lamblia, {{also known}} as Giardia intestinalis, [...] is a flagellated {{parasite}} that colonizes and reproduces in the small intestine, causing giardiasis. The parasite attaches to the epithelium by a ventral adhesive disc, and reproduces via binary fission. Giardiasis does not spread via the bloodstream, nor does it spread {{to other parts of}} the gastrointestinal tract, but remains confined to the lumen of the small intestine. Giardia trophozoites absorb their nutrients from the lumen of the small intestine, and are anaerobes.

Chief pathways of human infection include ingestion of untreated sewage, a phenomenon particularly common in many developing countries; contamination of natural waters also occurs in watersheds where <b>intensive</b> <b>grazing</b> occurs.|$|E
2500|$|One {{limitation}} of any land management {{system is that}} economically and politically powerful users can easily quantify and argue their needs. It is harder to define the economic value of ecosystem services and, therefore, the ecosystems and people most dependent on them for their subsistence become voiceless and often neglected users. In theory Holistic Management framework addresses this issue, {{but it is not}} always seen in the field. Another common criticism of holistic planned grazing is that while farmers and ranchers around the world believe that it works for them and they have even received awards, the majority of range scientists {{have not been able to}} experimentally confirm that <b>intensive</b> <b>grazing</b> systems similar to those at the center of holistic management show a benefit, and claim that [...] managers' reports of success are anecdotal.
