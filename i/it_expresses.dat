25|$|The line {{shape of}} the phonon side band {{is that of a}} Poisson {{distribution}} as <b>it</b> <b>expresses</b> a discrete number of events, electronic transitions with phonons, during a period of time. At higher temperatures, or when the chromophore interacts strongly with the matrix, the probability of multiphonon is high and the phonon side band approximates a Gaussian distribution.|$|E

25|$|Both {{the primal}} and the dual {{problems}} {{make use of}} the same matrix. In the primal space, this matrix expresses the consumption of physical quantities of inputs necessary to produce set quantities of outputs. In the dual space, <b>it</b> <b>expresses</b> the creation of the economic values associated with the outputs from set input unit prices.|$|E
25|$|In {{estimation}} {{theory and}} statistics, the Cramér–Rao bound (CRB) or Cramér–Rao lower bound (CRLB), {{named in honor}} of Harald Cramér and Calyampudi Radhakrishna Rao who {{were among the first to}} derive <b>it,</b> <b>expresses</b> a lower bound on the variance of estimators of a deterministic (fixed, though unknown) parameter. The bound is also known as the Cramér–Rao inequality or the information inequality.|$|E
25|$|Your phrase 'my copy is not mine' {{is not a}} bull. It is {{perfectly}} good English {{to use the same}} word in two different senses in one sentence, particularly when there is usage. Incongruity of language is no bull, for <b>it</b> <b>expresses</b> meaning. But incongruity of ideas (as {{in the case of the}} Irishman who was pulling up the rope, and finding it did not finish, cried out that somebody had cut off the other end of it) is the genuine bull.|$|E

25|$|A forest f {{consists}} of a list of trees, while a tree t {{consists of}} a pair of a value v and a forest f (its children). This definition is elegant and easy to work with abstractly (such as when proving theorems about properties of trees), as <b>it</b> <b>expresses</b> a tree in simple terms: a list of one type, and a pair of two types. Further, it matches many algorithms on trees, which consist of doing one thing with the value, and another thing with the children.|$|E
25|$|The {{early life}} of Saint Martin {{was written by}} Sulpicius Severus, who knew him personally. <b>It</b> <b>expresses</b> the {{intimate}} closeness the 4th-century Christian felt with the Devil in all his disguises, and has many accounts of miracles. Some follow familiar conventions— casting out devils, raising the paralytic and the dead. Others are more unusual: turning back the flames from a house while Martin was burning down the Roman temple it adjoined; deflecting {{the path of a}} felled sacred pine; the healing power of a letter written from Martin.|$|E
25|$|The axis mundi (also cosmic axis, world axis, world pillar, {{center of}} the world, world tree), in certain beliefs and philosophies, is the world center, or the {{connection}} between Heaven and Earth. As the celestial pole and geographic pole, <b>it</b> <b>expresses</b> a point of connection between sky and earth where the four compass directions meet. At this point travel and correspondence is made between higher and lower realms. Communication from lower realms may ascend to higher ones and blessings from higher realms may descend to lower ones and be disseminated to all. The spot functions as the omphalos (navel), the world's point of beginning.|$|E

25|$|Those {{who believe}} in the {{inspiration}} of scripture teach that it is infallible (or inerrant), that is, free from error in the truths <b>it</b> <b>expresses</b> by its character as the word of God. However, the scope of what this encompasses is disputed, as the term includes 'faith and practice' positions, with some denominations holding that the historical or scientific details, which may be irrelevant to matters of faith and Christian practice, may contain errors. Other scholars take stronger views, but for a few verses these positions require more exegetical work, leading to dispute (compare the serious debate over the related issue of perspicuity, attracting biblical and philosophical discussion).|$|E
25|$|On August 31st 2017, {{representatives of}} the Conference of European Rabbis, the Rabbinical Council of America, and the Commission of the Chief Rabbinate of Israel issued and {{presented}} the Holy See with a statement entitled Between Jerusalem and Rome. The document pays particular tribute to the Second Vatican Council’s Declaration Nostra Aetate, whose fourth chapter represents the Magna Charta of the Holy See's dialogue with the Jewish world. The Statement Between Jerusalem and Rome does not hide the theological differences that exist between the two faith traditions while all the same <b>it</b> <b>expresses</b> a firm resolve to collaborate more closely, {{now and in the}} future.|$|E
25|$|Whether {{that term}} Filioque is included, {{as well as}} how it is {{translated}} and understood, can have important implications for how one understands the central Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity. For some, the term implies a serious underestimation of the Father's role in the Trinity; for others, denial of what <b>it</b> <b>expresses</b> implies a serious underestimation {{of the role of the}} Son in the Trinity. Over time, the term became a symbol of conflict between Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity, although there have been attempts at resolving the conflict. Among the early attempts at harmonization are the works of Maximus the Confessor, who notably was canonised independently by both Eastern and Western churches.|$|E

25|$|The Shaktis took {{a further}} step. Their ideology, based mainly on tantras, sees Shakti as the {{principle}} of energy through which all divinity functions, thus showing the masculine as depending on the feminine. In the great shakta scripture known as the Devi Mahatmya, all the goddesses are aspects of one presiding female force—one in truth and many in expression—giving {{the world and the}} cosmos the galvanic energy for motion. <b>It</b> <b>expresses</b> through philosophical tracts and metaphor, that the potentiality of masculine being is actuated by the feminine divine. More recently, the Indian author Rajesh Talwar has critiqued Western religion and written eloquently on the sacred feminine {{in the context of the}} North Indian Goddess Vaishno Devi.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of a mosque is simple and <b>it</b> <b>expresses</b> openness. Calligraphic inscriptions from the Quran decorate mosques and mausoleums in Punjab. The inscriptions on bricks and tiles of the mausoleum of Shah Rukn-e-Alam (1320 AD) at Multan are outstanding specimens of architectural calligraphy. The earliest existing building in South Asia with enamelled tile-work is the tomb of Shah Yusuf Gardezi (1150 AD) at Multan. A specimen {{of the sixteenth century}} tile-work at Lahore is the tomb of Sheikh Musa Ahangar, with its brilliant blue dome. The tile-work of Emperor Shah Jahan is of a richer and more elaborate nature. The pictured wall of Lahore Fort is the last line in the tile-work in the entire world.|$|E
25|$|Psychopathy is a {{personality}} disorder which has symptoms expressed {{over a wide}} range of settings. Socially, <b>it</b> <b>expresses</b> extensive callous and manipulative self-serving behaviors with no regard for others, and often is associated with repeated delinquency, crime and violence, but may also present itself in other, maybe even successful social settings. Mentally, impairments in processes related to affect (emotion) and cognition, particularly socially related mental processes, have been found in those with the disorder which suggest that their destructive social behavior is borne from these aberrant mental processes. Developmentally, symptoms of psychopathy have been identified in young children with conduct disorder, and is suggestive of at least a partial constitutional factor that influences its development.|$|E

25|$|From {{a social}} and {{cultural}} standpoint, the Old Casino is significant in that <b>it</b> <b>expresses</b> to this day the lifestyle of the area's wealthy families during {{the early decades of}} the 20th century. It is a reminder of how they lived and how World War II changed that lifestyle for ever. The lavish second floor ballroom was extensively used prior to WWII as the de facto meeting place for the most wealthy and influential families in Ponce and Puerto Rico. The Casino is associated with the social club that made the structure come to life, a club that has ceased to exist as today's way of life have pushed aside the lifestyle of the aristocracy of yesterday.|$|E
25|$|Strictly speaking, the theorem only {{applies to}} a class of {{mathematical}} functions having a Fourier transform that is zero outside of a finite region of frequencies. Intuitively we expect that when one reduces a continuous function to a discrete sequence and interpolates back to a continuous function, the fidelity of the result depends on the density (or sample rate) of the original samples. The sampling theorem introduces {{the concept of a}} sample rate that is sufficient for perfect fidelity for the class of functions that are bandlimited to a given bandwidth, such that no actual information is lost in the sampling process. <b>It</b> <b>expresses</b> the sufficient sample rate in terms of the bandwidth for the class of functions. The theorem also leads to a formula for perfectly reconstructing the original continuous-time function from the samples.|$|E
