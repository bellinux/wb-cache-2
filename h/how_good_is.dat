When men think to carry all afore them, with speaking uncharitably and disgracefully of their brethren or their opinions, may not such be answered as Job answered his unfriendly visitants (Job 6:25), 'How forcible are right words! But what doth your arguing reprove?' How healing are words fitly spoken! A word in season, <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>is</b> it! If we would seek peace, let us clothe all our treaties for peace with acceptable words; and where one word may better accommodate than another, {{let that be}} used to express persons or things by, and let us not, as some do, call the different practices of our brethren will-worship, and their different opinions doctrines of devils, and the doctrine of Balaam, who taught fornication, &c., unless we can plainly, and in expressness of terms, prove it so; such language as this hath strangely divided our spirits, and hardened our hearts one towards another.|$|E
60|$|One {{other thing}} may be told of her. She {{had given her}} heart,--for good and all, as she owned to herself,--to Frank Greystock. She had owned to herself that it was so, and had owned to herself that nothing could come of it. Frank was {{becoming}} a man of mark,--but was becoming a man of mark without much money. Of all men {{he was the last}} who could afford to marry a governess. And then, moreover, he had never said a word to make her think that he loved her. He had called on her once or twice at Fawn Court,--as why should he not? Seeing that there had been friendship between the families for so many years, who could complain of that? Lady Fawn, however, had--not complained, but just said a word. A word in season, <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>is</b> it? Lucy did not much regard the word spoken to herself; but when she reflected that a word must also have been spoken to Mr. Greystock,--otherwise how should it have been that he never came again?--that she did not like.|$|E
6000|$|Christians, {{when they}} would comfort their dejected brethren, talk too much at rovers37 or in generals; they should be more at the mark: [...] "A word spoken in season, <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>is</b> it?" [...] I say, Christians should observe and inquire, that they may observe the cause or ground of their brother's trouble; and having first taken notice of that, in the next place {{consider}} under which of the offices of Jesus Christ this sin or trouble has cast this man; and so labour to apply Christ in {{the word of the}} gospel to him. Sometimes we are bid to consider him as an Apostle and High Priest, and sometimes as a forerunner and an Advocate. And he has, as was said afore, these divers offices, with others, that we by the consideration of him might be relieved under our manifold temptations. This, as I said, as I perceive John teaches us here, as he doth a little before of his being a sacrifice for us; for he presenteth them that after conversion shall sin with Christ as an Advocate with the Father. As who should say, My brethren, are you tempted, are you accused, have you sinned, has Satan prevailed against you? [...] "We have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous." ...|$|E

60|$|No {{one seems}} really {{to know the}} cause of the South Sea elephantiasis. One theory is that it is caused by the {{drinking}} of polluted water. Another theory attributes it to inoculation through mosquito bites. A third theory charges it to predisposition plus the process of acclimatization. On the other hand, no one that stands in finicky dread of it and similar diseases can afford to travel in the South Seas. There will be occasions when such a one must drink water. There may be also occasions when the mosquitoes let up biting. But every precaution of the finicky one will be useless. If he runs barefoot across the beach to have a swim, he will tread where an elephantiasis case trod a few minutes before. If he closets himself in his own house, yet every bit of fresh food on his table will have been subjected to the contamination, be it flesh, fish, fowl, or vegetable. In the public market at Papeete two known lepers run stalls, and heaven alone knows through what channels arrive at that market the daily supplies of fish, fruit, meat, and vegetables. The only happy way to go through the South Seas is with a careless poise, without apprehension, and with a Christian Science-like faith in the resplendent fortune of your own particular star. When you see a woman, afflicted with elephantiasis wringing out cream from cocoanut meat with her naked hands, drink and reflect <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>is</b> the cream, forgetting the hands that pressed it out. Also, remember that diseases such as elephantiasis and leprosy {{do not seem to be}} caught by contact.|$|E
