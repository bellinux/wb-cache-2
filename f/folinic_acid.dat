5|$|Pyridoxine, {{also known}} as vitamin B6, {{can be used to}} {{counteract}} the inhibition by MMH on the pyridoxine-dependent step in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter GABA. Thus GABA synthesis can continue and symptoms are relieved. Pyridoxine, which is only useful for the neurological symptoms and does not decrease hepatic toxicity, is given at a dose of 25mg/kg; this can be repeated up to a maximum total of 15 to 30g daily if symptoms do not improve. Benzodiazepines are given to control seizures; as they also modulate GABA receptors they may potentially increase the effect of pyridoxine. Additionally MMH inhibits the chemical transformation of folic acid into its active form, <b>folinic</b> <b>acid,</b> this can be treated by <b>folinic</b> <b>acid</b> given at 20–200mg daily.|$|E

An individual with the gene variant or SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) may need increased intake of [...] and <b>Folinic</b> <b>acid</b> to override the effect of a variant SNP. Increased risk for neural tube defects and elevated homocysteine levels have been associated with the MTHFR C677T polymorphism.|$|E
40|$|Amethopterine, a {{folic acid}} {{antagonist}} extensively used as an anti-neoplastic agent, adsorbs strongly on to mercury electrodes. Similar behaviour is also shown by other pterines such as folic and <b>folinic</b> <b>acids.</b> By using this phenomenon to accumulate these compounds at a static mercury drop electrode, prior to differential-pulse voltammetric measurements, very high sensitivities can be readily achieved. The influence of several variables (such as the accumulation time, accumulation potential, analyte concentration {{and the presence of}} surfactants) on the adsorptive stripping response has been evaluated. Applications to serum drug determination are also presented...|$|R
40|$|Bacillus subtilis is {{moderately}} {{sensitive to}} the folic acid antagonists aminopterin and amethop-terin, but neither folic nor <b>folinic</b> <b>acids</b> overcome growth inhibition in agar diffusion assay (Guthrie et al., 1956 a). In contrast, the pyrimidine moiety of thiamine and its congeners {{were found to be}} highly effective and specific as reversing agents. An inferred inhibition of thiamine synthesis by amethopterin was substantiated by Pine and Guthrie (1959) but it {{did not appear to be}} critical in impeding growth. Subsequently a system for the cellular trans-port of aminopterin was found in B. subtilis. Its activity was antagonized by the pyrimidine, and diminished in aminopterin-resistant mutants (Pine, 1960). The present findings give confirma-tory evidence for the transport system as the site of reversal. A number of diverse compounds have since been found to restore growth com-petitively and analogously to suppress the up-take of aminopterin...|$|R
40|$|It {{is known}} that malaria parasites are {{inhibited}} by sulfonamides and antifolate compounds, require 4 -aminobenzoic acid for growth, and respond only partly to intact folic and <b>folinic</b> <b>acids.</b> Biochemical data obtained {{during the last decade}} on the synthesis of nucleic acid precursors and on folate enzymes in malaria support the hypothesis that malaria parasites are similar to microorganisms that synthesize folate cofactors de novo. Sulfa drugs inhibit plasmodial dihydropteroate synthase (EC 2. 5. 1. 15). Pyrimethamine and many other antifolate compounds bind to tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (EC 1. 5. 1. 3) of the parasite more tightly than to the host enzyme. However, the metabolic consequences of the depletion of folate cofactors as a result of drug inhibition are not yet known. Other areas to be studied are the origin of the pteridine moiety of folates, the addition of glutamate(s) in folate cofactor biosynthesis, the means by which intact, exogenous folates affect malarial growth, and demonstration of the enzymes and reactions involving N 5 -methyl tetrahydrofolate...|$|R

40|$|Seven {{patients}} {{are described in}} whom dementia developed during treatment with methotrexate for meningeal leukaemia. The patients presented with confusion, tremor, ataxia, irritability, and somnolence. There were major epileptic fits in two cases and in one case there was progression to coma and death. Necropsy findings in the latter showed infarcted areas in the temporal and parietal lobes, with no evidence of active leukaemic disease or of viral encephalitis. The condition has not responded to radiotherapy and no positive evidence of viral encephalitis has been obtained. On the other hand, when treated with <b>folinic</b> and folic <b>acid</b> the deterioration has been arrested {{and there has been}} some improvement; thus the condition appears to be due to methotrexate. The occurrence of so many cases within the past year of a condition not previously described is probably attributable to the introduction of intensive cytotoxic therapy directed against meningeal leukaemia...|$|R
40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{an explanation}} for in vitro sulfonamide enhancement by high-pressure oxygen (HPO) and the reported absence of enhancement with in vivo therapy, Pseudomonas aeruginosa cultures were exposed to selected antifolate antimicrobials {{in the presence of}} 1. 87 atm absolute of O 2 and compared with non-HPO treated controls. Under these conditions, HPO alone retarded growth. Trimethoprim, a non-sulfonamide which inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, was not bactericidal, nor did HPO enhance existent bacteriostatic activity. The sulfonamide, sulfisozazole, was not bactericidal, but HPO enhanced bacteriostatic activity twofold; bacteriostasis was mitigated in HPO-treated and control cultures by p-aminobenzoate but not by a mixture of compounds involved in folate-mediated “ 1 -C” biosynthesis. Mafenide, a unique sulfonamide, at high concentrations with HPO, was synergistically bactericidal; non-HPO-treated cultures were bacteriostatically inhibited. Bacteriostatic activity of lower mafenide concentrations was also enhanced at least twofold by HPO. These inhibitory effects of mafenide, acting with or without HPO, were mitigated by the above mixture, but not by p-aminobenzoate. This may explain the lack of in vivo HPO-mafenide enhancement in burn-wound sepsis where exudates would contain such a mixture. Lastly, HPO itself was largely bactericidal at 2. 87 atm absolute of O 2. This was reversed to various degrees by the above mixture, or its components, or by folic, <b>folinic,</b> or p-aminobenzoic <b>acids.</b> These in vitro interactions suggest HPO per se may act at the same site as some sulfonamides to inhibit folate synthesis (not primarily at the dihydrofolate reductase level), or coenzyme functions of folate, or both...|$|R

50|$|<b>Folinic</b> <b>acid</b> is a 5-formyl {{derivative}} of tetrahydrofolic acid. It is readily converted to other reduced folic acid derivatives (e.g., tetrahydrofolate), thus has vitamin activity {{equivalent to that}} of folic acid. Since {{it does not require}} the action of dihydrofolate reductase for its conversion, its function as a vitamin is unaffected by inhibition of this enzyme by drugs such as methotrexate. This is the classical view of <b>folinic</b> <b>acid</b> rescue therapy. In 1980s, however, <b>folinic</b> <b>acid</b> was found to reactivate the dihydrofolate reductase itself even when methotrexate exists. Although the mechanism is not very clear, the polyglutamylation of methotrexate and dihydrofolate in malignant cells is considered {{to play an important role}} in the selective reactivation of dihydrofolate reductase by <b>folinic</b> <b>acid</b> in normal cells.|$|E

The supplement of <b>folinic</b> <b>acid</b> in people undergoing methotrexate treatment is to give cells dividing less rapidly enough folate to maintain normal cell functions. The amount of folate given is depleted by rapidly dividing cells (cancer) quickly, and so does not negate the effects of methotrexate.|$|E
