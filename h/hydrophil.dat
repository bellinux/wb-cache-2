40|$|Les oeufs de nématodes sont présents dans les eaux usées et dans les boues résiduaires. Suite à ce constat, l'objectif de ce travail est la mise en évidence d'une éventuelle capacité d'adhésion par contact et {{fixation}} des oeufs sur différentes surfaces. L'oeuf d'Ascaris a été utilisé comme modèle et divers paramètres sus- ceptibles d'intervenir ou de modifier les interactions ont été testés. Sur les matériaux de laboratoire, 32, 5 % des oeufs se fixent sur les tubes de verre contre respectivement 15, 7 % et 9, 1 % sur des tubes en polystyrène et en polypropylène. En eau désionisée, les oeufs montrent une forte capacité d'adhésion sur le support hydrophile avec 75 % d'oeufs fixés sur les particules de poudre de verre contre uniquement 1, 3 % sur les feuillets hydrophobes de talc. L'adhésion sur la poudre de verre est très rapide avec 55 % des oeufs fixés après 30 secondes. En présence d'une charge en adsorbant de 10 g/l, pour une valeur de pH égale à 9 et pour les concentrations ioniques (CaCl 2 et NaCl 0, 9 M), l'adhésion des oeufs sur la poudre de verre atteint 99 %. Cependant, des températures égales à 2 °C et 3 60 °C ou l'utilisation de solutions éluantes (hypochlorite de sodium, formaldéhyde, détergents an ionique et caffonique) diminuent les phénomènes d'adhésion avec en particulier l'hypochlorite de sodium à 2 ° chl qui les supprime totalement. Toutes ces informations indiquent que l'adhésion intervient de manière importante. En effet, lors du traitement des effluents, ce phénomène favorise l'épuration par adhésion des oeufs au floc de matière organique avec cependant transfert de contaminants dans les boues. Dans les sols et sur les végétaux, l'adhésion favorise la contamination parasitaire des surfaces. L'utilisation d'effluents ou de boues contaminées devra impérativement respecter les normes ou les recommandations destinées à protéger des risques de transmission à l'homme et aux animaux. Les techniques destinées à évaluer la contamination parasitaire d'échantillons de l'environnement sont dépendantes de ces phénomènes d'adhésion. L'utilisation de solutions éluantes et notamment d'hypochlorite de sodium est indispensable. The intestinal nematodes use {{the environmental}} medium {{to realize their}} infestation cycle with eggs. In this study, the ability of helminth eggs to create binding in laboratory conditions is evaluated. This information will allow a better knowledge of the characteristics and the behaviour of the eggs in the environment and will give beginning of answer to the main question: are the nematodes eggs bound to sufaces and particulary to suspended matterin the environment or free particles?For this study, the model used is the Ascaris eggs collected {{in the end of}} the womb in order to work with fertile coated eggs. They seem to be the most common form found when the eggs are quantified in the water or wastewater medium. However, the aggregate in the suspension create difficulties for the counting and give a protect effect of the outer layer for the eggs into the aggregate. Physically, the aggregate properties are also different from the properties of one isolated egg. To spread out the eggs without bringing modifications of the egg coating, one filtration is performed on l 00 µm filter to eliminate the aggregate higher or equal to 4 eggs. Before the study, a possible adhesion on the laboratory materials is performed. On glass materials, a strong adhesion is observed with 32. 5 % of eggs on the surfaces; on the other hand, on polypropylen and on polystyren, the adhesion is less important, respectively 9. 1 and l 5. 7 % are adsorbed with a significant difference between these two results. Then for this work, polypropylen and polystyren materials are used. In deionised water (pH 6) with one 15 min stirring at 15 rpm, the behavior of the Ascaris eggs is studied on two surf'aces glass powder which is <b>hydrophil</b> particles with electronegative charges and talc which is hydrophob flakes with electronegative charges too. The results show a small adhesion on the hydrophob surfaces (l. 3 %) for a percentage of 75 % on the <b>hydrophil</b> particles with the glass powder. In the same experimental conditions, the adhesion on <b>hydrophil</b> surfaces is confirmed with two other adhesion media: the muscovite and the glass wool which show a significant adsorption (96 and 98. 5 %). Onglass powder, the adhesion characteristics are developed with the study of 5 parameters: the contact time, the adhesion medium concentration, the pH, the temperature and the ionic concentration. For a low glass powder concentration (1 g/l), a good adhesion is obtained with 65 % of egg bound. The adsorption is obtained rapidly, 55 % are already bound after 30 sec. The pH increase significanty the adhesion at the value 9 and an important decrease is observed atthe low and high temperatures (2 and 60 °c). To complete this study, reagents used as desorption solution in the analytical techniques for the research of the helminth eggs in wastewater are tested. The eluting solutions as formalin and detergents increase in a considerable proportion the percentage of eggs non adsorbed, the outer layer properties could be modified by these reagents. For the sodium hypochlorite solution, the activity is stronger. This reagent eliminates the egg adhesion with only 0. 1 percent of eggs bound. The action on the outer layer could be a destruction and then the loss of the adhesion properties. The practical implications of these adhesion properties are considerable: the wastewater depuration by physico-chemical treatments with the possibility of adhesion on floc particles for the eggs; the adhesion to the soil particles avoiding percolation and then the eggs accumulation in depth; on vegetables irrigated with wastewater the adsorption can improve the contamination and for the analytical techniques used to quantify parasite eggs in aqueous medium, we have to overcome the problem of the adhesion to the supports, with the use of eluting solution like sodium hypochlorite...|$|E

For example, the method of production of solar element and a unit of solar elements (RU 2532137) comprises following stages: formation of pn-transfer in semiconductor base plate, formation of passivating layer on the light-receptive surface and/or non light-receptive surface of semiconductor base plate and formation of power robbing electrodes on the light-receptive surface and non light-receptive. A film of aluminium oxide is formed as passivating layer, its thickness is up to 40 nm, and lectrode is formed by baking conductive paste under the temperature 500 – 900 ͦͦ°C for 1 second – 30 inutes with formation of sintered product. The sintered product penetrates through passivating layer setting electric contact between electrode and base plate. The formation of aluminium ide with specified thickness on the surface of base plate makes it possible to achieve good passivating characteristics and good electric contact between silica and electrode only by eans of baking conductive paste, that is standard technology. Moreover the baking stage which was necessary to get the effect of film passivation for aluminium oxide in the past now can be cancelled to decrease costs.

40|$|In part project 1 it transpired that oleyl {{sarcosinate}} {{stands out}} among the fatty amide carboxylic acids as a surfactant with excellent surface-active properties. A technical process was developed which involves transesterification of biodiesel by means of sodium sarcosinate. However, according to a rough cost estimate it is only at very large plant capacities that the process begins to become economically more efficient than the current state-of-the-art process, the Schotten-Baumann reaction with oleyl chloride. Moreover, the commercialisation of the developed manufacturing process may be frustrated by a patent that was filed by the Procter and Gamble company while the present project was still running. For these reasons the present studies on fatty amide carbonic acids were discontinued. Fatty amides with centrally located hydrophilic groups {{can be obtained by}} a reaction between epoxidised biodiesel or other epoxidised oils with any of various amines or amino acids. The product is a new type of surfactant including ones with excellent surface-active properties. Unfortunately the best-performing products are only ''moderately'' degradable and have a relatively high ecotoxicity. Biodiesel (rape oil methyl ester) can be epoxidised in a two-phase system with hydrogen peroxide and formic acid. Triglycerides can be epoxidised analogously. After separation of the aqueous phase the epoxidised biodiesel is ready for surfactant synthesis without the need for further purification. In part project 2 a method was successfully elaborated for synthesising oleic acid alkanolamine directly from the triglyceride and alkanolamine without using solvents. Various ethoxilated rape oil ethanolamides have very good colloidochemical and application-relevant properties, comparable with those of the best nonionic standard surfactants based on ethoxilated oxo alcohols.

40|$|Turning hydrophob exogen and endogen {{substrates}} into <b>hydrophil</b> substances, thus {{prepared for}} renal passage, {{is one of}} the major functions of the biotransformation. It can be divided into Phase I and Phase II reactions, whose metabolic activity underlies a wide ranged diversity, influenced by genetic interindividual and interethnic variations. In case of a genetically caused functional deviation of this system, a resulting increased oxidative stress can develop its cyto- and genotoxic potential. The microsomale epoxide hydrolase is a phase II enzyme, which turns highly reactive epoxides from phase I into water soluble Transdihydrodiol derivates thus neutralising the substances. A mutation of the genes encoding for this detoxification system could therefore be a genetic co-risk-factor in the genesis of a chronic pancreatitis or pancreas carcinoma, especially because these diseases are associated with exogen substrates. In order to get a valid message concerning the distribution of the genotype of the patients versus the genotypic frequency in the normal population a high number of cases was needed. Therefore we examined within our multicentric study an overall collective of 1999 cases. The DNA was examined with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure and a melting curve analysis with the help of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) probes and a light cycler. The study-collective consists out of 367 patients with pancreatic carcinoma, 341 with an alcoholic chronic pancreatitis, 431 with idiopathic pancreatitis, 181 with acute pancreatitis and 679 controls with the same ethnic background (white Caucasian). The study shows that only patients with an alcoholic chronic pancreatitis (ACP) have a significant increase of the EPHX-Y 113 H polymorphism compared to the control group (p< 0, 006). The Tyr 113 allel could be found with a frequency of 0, 74 within the ACP compared to the control group with a frequency of 0, 68. This results in a corresponding risk ratio of 1, 21 (95 %Cl, 1, 06 - 1, 37). There was no significant accumulation of the Tyr 113 allel in the other pancreas groups (AP: 0, 68; ICP: 0, 68; Ca: 0, 68; controls: 0, 68). To raise phenotypic expressions and/or further risk factors we analysed a subcollective of N= 385. This white Caucasian study-collective (N= 385) consists out of 53 patients with a chronic pancreatitis (CP), out of 88 with an adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and out of 244 healthy controls. The association of an ACP and the genotype which was seen in the big study-collective could not be found in this small group. A number of expected significant distributions of phenotypic expressions could be found though. Smokers are significantly more frequent within the patients with chronic pancreatitis (p= 0, 003). Pancreascalcifications and pseudocysts are typical for a chronic pancreatitis and therefore significantly increased (p< 0, 001). It turned out, that the patients with a carcinoma and an homocygot genotype were significantly younger (p< 0, 017; 52, 7 ± 12 vs. 60 ± 11 ys). Homocygot carcinoma patients drink according to the small collective significantly more alcohol per week (p< 0, 001). Considering the function and the characteristics of the EPHX system these numbers appear partially contradictory. The significant lower alcohol consume in the homocygot chronic pancreatitis group (p< 0, 003) could be a hint to the proinflammatoric effect of the mutation. The seen moderate synergy between the EPHX 1 -Y 113 H polymorphism and the incidence of an alcoholic chronic pancreatitis underlines the hypothesis of an interaction between a genetic susceptibility and an exogen (risk-) factor in the genesis of chronic pancreatitis. In our study we did only examine one phase I-/phase II-gen, but it can be speculated, that a combination of multiple genetically determined enzyme-activities play a major role in the ability of detoxification of every single individual. In order to proof these synergies statistically reliable, even bigger study-collectives are needed...|$|E
