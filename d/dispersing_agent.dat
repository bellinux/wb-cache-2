50|$|Disperse dyes were {{originally}} {{developed for the}} dyeing of cellulose acetate, and are water-insoluble. The dyes are finely ground {{in the presence of}} a <b>dispersing</b> <b>agent</b> and sold as a paste, or spray-dried and sold as a powder. Their main use is to dye polyester but they can also be used to dye nylon, cellulose triacetate, and acrylic fibers. In some cases, a dyeing temperature of 130 °C is required, and a pressurised dyebath is used. The very fine particle size gives a large surface area that aids dissolution to allow uptake by the fiber. The dyeing rate can be significantly influenced by the choice of <b>dispersing</b> <b>agent</b> used during the grinding.|$|E

For titanium dioxide nanoparticles, dis-persion in a poly(methyl methacrylate) matrix was maximized with a second genera-tion dendrimer containing four carboxylic acid end groups, and the quality of disper-sion was observed to be superior to commercial <b>dispersing</b> <b>agents</b> for TiO 2.

40|$|This work {{is based}} on the {{analysis}} of the influence of <b>dispersing</b> <b>agents</b> on the non-isothermal kinetics, thermomechanical behavior and dispersing action of PET/TiO 2 nanocomposites. The influence of two montanic waxes and an amide wax used as <b>dispersing</b> <b>agents</b> in the nucleating effect of the nanoparticles is studied. The <b>dispersing</b> <b>agents</b> are the following: a) a partly saponified ester of montanic acids (PSEMA), b) an ester of montanic acids with multifunctional alcohols (MAWMA) and c) an amide wax based on N,N '-Bisstearoyl ethylenediamine (AW). The non-isothermal kinetics based on the Avrami method revealed that MAWMA and PSEMA favors the nucleating effect of the nanoparticles when are included in PET. Birefringence microscopy points out the good dispersing capacity of MAWMA and AW and the termomechanical analysis confirmed that the ester of montanic acids with multifunctional alcohols MAWMA shows the best dispersing properties and best promotes the nucleating effect of the TiO 2 nanoparticles when used for PET/TiO 2 nanocomposites productionPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to develop new approaches for the improvement of the properties of polymer carbon nanotube composites by effectively aligning and dispersing the CNT's in the polymer matrix. Specifically, {{this research}}ed explored at how to mediate the problem of carbon nanotube insolubility in a matrix material. This was accomplished by assessing the effects of three different <b>dispersing</b> <b>agents</b> and two different alignment methods on the final composite properties. In previous research, the <b>dispersing</b> <b>agents</b> were found to either adequately disperse the carbon nanotubes or improve the mechanical properties of the composite material. 4 - 6 Thus, comparing the three <b>dispersing</b> <b>agents</b> in different matrix materials and different processing methods can lead to a new understanding of interfacial interactions within the different composite materials. This understanding can then lead to the creation of more effective carbon nanotube composites that both adequately disperse the carbon nanotubes and improve the mechanical properties. Ph. D.

50|$|Regulation causes {{flooding}} to be decreased {{during the}} winter and spring months, and water more consistently flows {{during the summer and}} autumn months. Since the river red gum disperses its seed during spring, regulating the water may affect the species' ability to disperse using water as a <b>dispersing</b> <b>agent,</b> especially in floodplain red gum forests.

5000|$|Macroemulsions are kinetically {{stabilized}} {{mixtures of}} at least two immiscible liquids where one of the liquids has droplets with a diameter greater than 0.1 μm. Macroemulsions scatter light effectively and therefore appear milky, because their droplets are greater than a wavelength of light. [...] They are part of a larger family of emulsions along with microemulsions. As with all emulsions, one phase serves as the <b>dispersing</b> <b>agent.</b> It is often called the continuous or outer phase. The remaining phase(s) are disperse or inner phase(s), because the liquid droplets are finely distributed amongst the larger continuous phase droplets. This type of emulsion is thermodynamically unstable, but can be stabilized {{for a period of time}} with applications of kinetic energy. Surfactants (emulsifiers) are used to reduce the interfacial tension between the two layers, and induce macroemulsion stability for a useful amount of time. Emulsion in which the particles of the dispersed phase have diameters from approximately 1 to 100 μm.Note 1: Macro-emulsions comprise large droplets and thus are [...] "unstable" [...] in the sense that the droplets sediment or float, depending on the densities of the dispersed phase and dispersion medium. Separation of the dispersed and continuous phases usually occurs within time periods from a few seconds to a few hours, depending upon the viscosity of the fluid medium and the size and density of the droplets.Note 2: Macro-emulsions usually contain low-molecular-weight or polymeric surfactants that decrease the rates of coalescence of dispersed droplets. Droplets of the dispersed phase may be also stabilized by adsorption of solid particles onto their surface (so-called Pickering stabilization).|$|E

In DLVO theory, the potential energy of van der Waals attraction and the potential energy of the electrical double layer interaction [13] are summed to provide a total interaction potential energy between colloidal particles. Due to differences in the surface chemistries of <b>dispersing</b> <b>agent</b> and ITO-NPs, obtaining a stable dispersion of polymeric <b>dispersing</b> <b>agent</b> and ITO-NPs can be challenging.
