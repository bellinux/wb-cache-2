25|$|Spirits were marketed in Mexico. They were badged as Chryslers {{rather than}} Dodges, since the Dodge brand {{at the time}} was used only on trucks. The Spirit was {{introduced}} in the Mexican market for 1990, one year after its début in the U.S. and Canada. The 1990-1991 Mexican versions were equipped with the U.S. market Plymouth Acclaim tail lights. The initial 1990-model Spirits used a version of the 2.5L engine operating on leaded gasoline, equipped with a carburetor, a tubular <b>exhaust</b> <b>header,</b> and electronic control of ignition timing. This induction and ignition system used technology and components very similar to those employed in Chrysler's U.S.-market Lean Burn emission control systems of the late-1970s.|$|E
2500|$|The engine has a {{stainless}} steel <b>exhaust</b> <b>header</b> and Bendix electronic fuel injection (EFI), with four injector valves, an electronic control unit (ECU), five independent sensors and two fuel pumps. Some [...] lighter than the SOHC Vega engine, it develops maximum power at 5,600rpm and is redlined at 6,500rpm, whereas the SOHC Vega engine peaks at 4,400rpm and runs to 5,000rpm. Final ratings are [...] at 5,600rpm, [...] of torque at 4,800rpm.|$|E
5000|$|The three-cylinder GT models {{featured}} bifurcation of {{the center}} cylinder <b>exhaust</b> <b>header.</b> This allowed Suzuki to use four mufflers rather than an unbalanced [...] "2 and 1" [...] or a [...] "three into two" [...] exhaust arrangement.|$|E
50|$|The F22B2, F22B3, F22B6 and F22B8 are similar, {{though their}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>headers</b> vary between each.|$|R
50|$|Between April 1973 and August 1973, Ford Australia built 250 XA Falcon GTs {{fitted with}} the RPO 83 package, 130 of these being sedans and 120 being hardtops. RPO 83 {{comprised}} three variations {{from the standard}} XA Falcon GT, these being of a Holley 780 carburettor, 2.25 inch <b>exhaust</b> <b>headers</b> and a clutch slave cylinder hydraulic pipe heat shield. Pricing and external appearance did not vary from the standard models. The 2.25 inch <b>exhaust</b> <b>headers</b> were subsequently homologated for the XA Falcon GT for Group C Touring Car racing, including the 1973 Hardie-Ferodo 1000.|$|R
50|$|Port-matching — {{the lining}} {{up of the}} intake manifold, {{cylinder}} head ports and <b>exhaust</b> <b>headers</b> as to create one continuous smooth course of travel for engine gases with no ledges or obstructions.|$|R
50|$|The heat {{problem can}} be {{minimized}} by staggering the ports in terms of height and using heat proof wraps and coatings on the <b>exhaust</b> <b>header</b> {{to the point that}} it poses a negligible problem. The heat can also be used as an advantage.|$|E
5000|$|This {{update of}} the S14B23 {{produced}} , or [...] if {{equipped with a}} catalytic converter. Changes include a revised intake camshaft profile and modified exhaust camshaft timing, increased compression, and a more efficient cylinder head intake port design. Larger diameter <b>exhaust</b> <b>header</b> tubes are used.|$|E
50|$|Other Z engines have {{aluminum}} alloy block and head, with cast-iron cylinder liners. The block features split {{upper and lower}} block assembly for added strength and rigidity, special long intake manifold for added torque, S-VT continuous variable valve timing, and a stainless steel 4:1 <b>exhaust</b> <b>header.</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{provides the}} technical specifications {{for the equipment}} fabrication, installation, and sitework construction for the Standard Hydrogen Monitoring System. The Standard Hydrogen Monitoring System is designed to remove gases from waste tank vapor space and <b>exhaust</b> <b>headers</b> for continual monitoring and remote sample analysis...|$|R
50|$|Some modern <b>exhaust</b> <b>headers</b> are {{available}} with a ceramic coating. This coating serves to prohibit rust and {{to reduce the amount}} of heat radiated into the engine bay. The heat reduction will help prevent intake manifold heat soak, which will decrease the temperature of the air entering the engine.|$|R
50|$|The goal of {{performance}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>headers</b> is mainly to decrease flow resistance (back pressure), {{and to increase}} the volumetric efficiency of an engine, resulting in a gain in power output. The processes occurring {{can be explained by}} the gas laws, specifically the ideal gas law and the combined gas law.|$|R
50|$|Other {{features}} are intake cam-phasing VVT, VTCS, VICS, {{a stainless steel}} 4:1 <b>exhaust</b> <b>header</b> and a lower main bearing cage for increased block rigidity. Direct-injection {{is available on the}} 2.0 L LF-VD and the award-winning (DISI) turbocharged L3-VDT engine introduced in 2006 for the Mazdaspeed lineup of vehicles.|$|E
50|$|The {{conventional}} geared aircraft is all-wood, with veneer wood skins. The propeller {{was mounted}} through a forward radiator. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>header</b> stack turned upward, projecting above {{the top of}} the fuselage. The fuel tanks are wing mounted. The wing has a chord that spans most of the length of the fuselage.|$|E
50|$|Ivan Capelli was the charger in the race. Starting 10th he spun {{early to}} avoid the {{collision}} between Patrese and Alessandro Nannini. Then racing with a broken <b>exhaust</b> <b>header</b> he charged hard, eventually passing Gerhard Berger for 3rd {{and for a time}} being the fastest driver on the track before retiring on lap 48 with a fuel leak.|$|E
25|$|The Cultus GTi was {{now much}} more powerful, {{reaching}} 115PS JIS (85kW) with {{updated version of}} the previous GTi engine: the G13B engine that had higher compression pistons (11.5:1 compression ratio), tubular <b>exhaust</b> <b>headers,</b> a tubular intake manifold, larger camshafts and a reprogrammed ECU. Some models of the Cultus GTi were also available with all-wheel drive.|$|R
5000|$|The top of {{the line}} {{performance}} engine in the E49 Chargers produced [...] @ 5600 rpm and 320 lbft Nm of torque @ 4400 rpm. The increased power is due mainly to a more aggressive camshaft, high-load valve springs, triple 45 mm DCOE Weber sidedraught carburetors, tuned-length <b>exhaust</b> <b>headers</b> and a higher compression ratio of 10.0:1.|$|R
5000|$|This street {{version of}} the XR250R had road legal lights and tires, a metal fuel tank, keyed ignition/steering lock, plus other minor changes. Some 40 lb heavier, it had reduced {{off-road}} ability. It shared the XR250R's RFVC [...] engine, but with a different carburetor and 3 mm smaller <b>exhaust</b> <b>headers</b> to meet emissions requirements. It was manufactured from 1991-2007.|$|R
50|$|The 900 uses a {{stainless}} 4-2-1 <b>exhaust</b> <b>header</b> while the 600 and 400 bikes use steel 4-1 headers. The later 600, {{and all the}} 900 versions use a tri-bolt can fitment. The earlier 600 and all 400 RF bikes use a slip on with link pipe system, with a join below {{the center of the}} bike.|$|E
50|$|Heat {{generated}} an engine's cylinders {{is transferred}} to a jacket water cooling system through the cylinder wall. In addition to cooling the cylinder walls, jacket water is often found as an insulator between the <b>exhaust</b> <b>header</b> and the engine room. Jacket water cooling systems can be cooled by a central cooling water loop or can be cooled directly by seawater.|$|E
5000|$|In the Mexican market, 1986 through 1990 {{vehicles}} used {{versions of}} the 2.2 and 2.5 engines operating on leaded gasoline, equipped with a carburetor, a tubular <b>exhaust</b> <b>header,</b> and electronic control of ignition timing. This induction and ignition system used technology and components {{very similar to those}} employed in Chrysler's US-market Lean Burn emission control systems of the late 1970s. This configuration was discontinued in favour of electronic fuel injection for the 1991 model year, when exhaust emission regulations took force in Mexico.|$|E
5000|$|Thermal barrier ceramic {{coatings}} {{are becoming}} more common in automotive applications. They are specifically designed to reduce heat loss from engine exhaust system components including exhaust manifolds, turbocharger casings, <b>exhaust</b> <b>headers,</b> downpipes and tailpipes. This process {{is also known as}} [...] "exhaust heat management". When used under-bonnet, these have the positive effect of reducing engine bay temperatures, therefore reducing the intake air temperature.|$|R
50|$|For the S38B36 {{displacement}} was enlarged from 3453 to 3535 cc, {{achieved by}} increasing the stroke from 84mm to 86mm by using a longer forged steel crankshaft. Different camshafts were also used and the compression ratio was increased to 10:1. A variable-length inlet manifold was used claimed to improve torque output, equal length stainless steel <b>exhaust</b> <b>headers</b> remains. The fuel injection system was Bosch Motronic.|$|R
50|$|The TR6C Trophy Special was {{the major}} {{influence}} on the new Scrambler, and the new bike shared the same key features - most obviously including the high level stacked twin exhausts and crossover <b>exhaust</b> <b>headers,</b> though Triumph had to swap sides (from left to right) with the stacked pipes because the battery box {{got in the way}} for running them on the left hand side.|$|R
5000|$|Marketed by its Austrian {{manufacturer}} KTM as a race-ready enduro machine, the 950SE embodies minimalist design principles. Equipped {{with twin}} carburetors, {{as opposed to}} electronic fuel injection, it also lacks ABS, traction control, a fuel gauge or a tachometer. Its dual silencers are upswept, with the front cylinder’s <b>exhaust</b> <b>header</b> routed beside the engine, {{in the manner of}} smaller enduro and dirt bikes. The one-piece plastic fuel tank is of relatively low capacity and the seat is very tall at 920mm (36.22 inches).|$|E
5000|$|All TX models {{shared the}} same 1.6-litre SOHC Isuzu engine (coded the G161Z). The engine was {{chain-driven}} and incorporated a cross-flow design alloy head. A two-barrel [...] "Nikki" [...] Stromberg carburettor was used on Australian models. Early TX models used a cast-iron free flow exhaust manifold, with two outlets into a [...] "Y" [...] pipe was used (this item is commonly used by modifiers for later models). From November 1976 this was changed to a single outlet <b>exhaust</b> <b>header</b> to comply with EPA regulations.|$|E
50|$|In 1998, Honda {{continued}} subtle refinements in {{the fourth}} generation CBR900RR's chassis. It got a stiffer frame more like the original, offset on the triple clamp reduced by 5 mm. Brakes got larger rotors {{on the front and}} new calipers and ergonomics was revised with raised footpegs. The engine got revised with 80 percent new internals in an effort to reduce friction and weight. Cylinders bore got an aluminum composites treatment and new pistons. It also got a larger radiator and a new <b>exhaust</b> <b>header</b> in stainless steel.|$|E
25|$|The {{choice of}} annular {{radiators}} for engine cooling on the Ju 88, which placed these radiators immediately forward of each engine and directly behind each propeller, allowed the cooling lines for the engine coolant and oil-cooling radiators (integrated within the annular design) {{to be as}} short as possible, with integral port and starboard air intakes for cooling the <b>exhaust</b> <b>headers,</b> the starboard inlet also supplying the inlet air for the supercharger.|$|R
2500|$|The AMC V8 engines, {{such as the}} [...] {{engine in}} one car was bored out to [...] and the [...] in the other to [...] The shop {{installed}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>headers,</b> eight-quart oil pans, oil coolers, hi-rise intake manifolds, racing camshafts with solid lifters and stronger springs, and larger carburetors. The cars had engine and rear-end oil coolers, and [...] cell-type safety fuel tanks. Engine components were X-rayed and Magnafluxed to check for cracks, as were chassis components.|$|R
40|$|There are two nitrogen/argon <b>exhaust</b> <b>headers</b> in the D 0 {{cryogenic}} piping system, one for {{the liquid}} argon dewar and another for the three argon calorimeters. These headers serve two functions, venting both nitrogen exhaust from the cooling loops and cold argon gas should any argon vessel blow a relief. These headers are vacuum jacketed until they exit the building. At that point, uninsulated exhaust stacks direct the flow into the atmosphere. This note deals with the these stacks...|$|R
50|$|The exhaust {{itself was}} {{unusual for the}} time in that the centre <b>exhaust</b> <b>header</b> was split in two and exited into two {{mufflers}} {{much smaller than the}} single mufflers supplied for the two outboard cylinders. This gave a bike a balanced look with two mufflers per side. The header pipes were all joined via balance tubes, known as Exhaust Coupler Tube System (ECTS), to increase low end torque. This exhaust was continued through to the end of production for the North American market but was dropped from the M model onwards in some other markets.|$|E
5000|$|The engine has a {{stainless}} steel <b>exhaust</b> <b>header</b> and Bendix electronic fuel injection (EFI), with four injector valves, an electronic control unit (ECU), five independent sensors and two fuel pumps. Some 60 lb lighter than the SOHC Vega engine, it develops maximum power at 5,600 rpm and is redlined at 6,500 rpm, whereas the SOHC Vega engine peaks at 4,400 rpm and runs to 5,000 rpm. Final ratings are [...] at 5,600 rpm, [...] of torque at 4,800 rpm.3,508 of the 5,000 engines were used. GM disassembled about 500 and scrapped the remainder.|$|E
50|$|With {{the growth}} in sales and {{additional}} product line launches the company worked {{to keep up with}} demand and ultimately found a partner in Advanced Control Engineering. After a brief downtime as the new deal was finalized, the new company came on line in August 2014 and products began to ship again and the customer service team addressed all open inquiries. Since the transition the company has launched new products for the BMW and the new Mustang, adding to the existing line up of GM-based products. Located on the 150,000 square foot facility of the Corona, CA headquarters, the company continues to manufacture its core suspension and <b>exhaust</b> <b>header</b> line up.|$|E
5000|$|In 2004 SVT {{released}} {{yet another}} [...] "Mystic" [...] Cobra this time resulting in color shifts from a bright, metallic topaz that transitions to cobalt blue, then to royal purple, and finally {{into a deep}} onyx black. Ford's color and trim director for North America Alan Eggly described the new paint color like this;"The bright, iridescent colors reminded me of chromed <b>exhaust</b> <b>headers</b> blued by intense heat," [...] Thus he dubbed the new paint [...] "Mystichrome".|$|R
5000|$|The HiPo {{engine was}} used in {{modified}} form by Carroll Shelby for the 1965-1967 Shelby GT350, raising rated power to [...] at 6,000 rpm through use of special <b>exhaust</b> <b>headers,</b> an aluminum intake manifold, and a larger carburetor. The Shelby engine also had a larger oil pan with baffles to reduce oil starvation in hard cornering. Shelby also replaced the internal front press-in oil gallery plugs with a screw-in type plug to reduce chances of failure.|$|R
5000|$|The AMC V8 engines, {{such as the}} 290 CID L {{engine in}} one car was bored out to 304 CID L and the 390 CID L in the other to 397 CID L. The shop {{installed}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>headers,</b> eight-quart oil pans, oil coolers, hi-rise intake manifolds, racing camshafts with solid lifters and stronger springs, and larger carburetors. The cars had engine and rear-end oil coolers, and [...] cell-type safety fuel tanks. Engine components were X-rayed and Magnafluxed to check for cracks, as were chassis components.|$|R
