40|$|Slant total {{electron}} content (STEC), {{the total}} number of free electrons on a ray path, is an important space weather observable. STEC is the main input for computerized ionospheric tomography (CIT). STEC can be estimated using the dual-frequency GPS receivers. GPS-STEC contains the space weather variability, yet the estimates are prone to measurement and instrument errors that are not related to the physical structure of the ionosphere. International Reference Ionosphere Extended to Plasmasphere (IRI-Plas) is the international standard climatic model of ionosphere and plasmasphere, providing vertical electron density profiles for a desired date, time, and location. IRI-Plas is used as the background model in CIT. Computation of STEC from IRI-Plas is a tedious task for researchers due to extensive geodetic calculations and IRI-Plas runs. In this study, IONOLAB group introduces a new space weather service to facilitate the computation of STEC from IRI-Plas (IRI-Plas-STEC) at www. ionolab. org. The IRI-Plas-STEC can be computed online for a desired location, <b>date,</b> <b>hour,</b> elevation, and azimuth angle. The user-friendly interface also provides means for computation of IRI-STEC for a desired location and date to indicate the variability in hour of the day, elevation, or azimuth angles.

The study {{was carried out in}} a property located in the north of the County of Valladolid (Spain). Nine wild adult animals, 2 males and 7 females, were used. They were marked individually with a microchip (AVID(r)). These animals were lodged in a 0. 5 ha. enclosure. It was composed of two areas, one smaller where burrows were located and a bigger area, in which animals had fresh food and water. Both areas were separated by a metallic net provided of two passageways, in which, two microchips readers were placed to register animal activity. Each register indicated <b>date,</b> <b>hour</b> and code of the animal that had gone through the passageway. An activity rate was determined as the number of times that the total of the animals went through all the passageways, per hour of each day of the study. A monthly index of activity was also determined by the average of the daily activity rates during each month. It was observed that wild rabbits present a pronounced twilight and night-time activity, with two activity peaks which coincide with the sunrise and sunset. It was also determined that the activity of the animals in central hours of the day was practically null in both sexes. The activity pattern was changing, gradually, in function of the hour of sunrise and sunset on each month of the study. The activity index increased from September on, reaching a maximum peak during December, and decreased gradually until February when this index increased slightly until the finalization of the study on March.

40|$|Abstract Background Compliance {{represents}} a major determinant for {{the effectiveness of}} pharmacotherapy. Compliance reports summarising electronically compiled compliance data qualify healthcare needs and can be utilised {{as part of a}} compliance enhancing intervention. Nevertheless, evidence-based information on a sufficient level of compliance is scarce complicating the interpretation of compliance reports. The purpose of our pilot {{study was to determine the}} compliance of ambulatory Alzheimer patients to antidementia drugs under routine therapeutic use using electronic monitoring. In addition, the forgiveness of donepezil (i. e. its ability to sustain adequate pharmacological response despite suboptimal compliance) was characterised and evidence-based guidance for the interpretation of compliance reports was intended to be developed. Methods We determined the compliance of four different antidementia drugs by electronic monitoring in 31 patients over six months. All patients were recruited from the gerontopsychiatric clinic of a university hospital as part of a pilot study. The so called medication event monitoring system (MEMS) was employed, consisting of a vial with a microprocessor in the lid which records the time (<b>date,</b> <b>hour,</b> minute) of every opening. Daily compliance served as primary outcome measure, defined as percentage of days with correctly administered doses of medication. In addition, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of donepezil were simulated to systematically assess therapeutic undersupply also incorporating study compliance patterns. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS and Microsoft Excel. Results Median daily compliance was 94 % (range 48 %- 99 %). Ten patients (32 %) were non-compliant at least for one month. One-sixth of patients taking donepezil displayed periods of therapeutic undersupply. For 10 mg and 5 mg donepezil once-daily dosing, the estimated forgiveness of donepezil was 80 % and 90 % daily compliance or two and one dosage omissions at steady state, respectively. Based on the simulation findings we developed rules for the evidence-based interpretation of donepezil compliance reports. Conclusions Compliance in ambulatory Alzheimer patients was for the first time assessed under routine conditions using electronic monitoring: On average compliance was relatively high but variable between patients. The approach of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic in silico simulations was suitable to characterise the forgiveness of donepezil suggesting evidence-based recommendations for the interpretation of compliance reports. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background With an Annual Parasite Incidence (API) of 132. 1, in {{the high}} and {{moderate}} risks zones, the Maroni area of French Guiana has the second highest malaria incidence of South-America after Guyana (API = 183. 54) and far above Brazil (API = 28. 25). Malaria transmission is occurring despite strong medical assistance and active vector control, based on general WHO recommendations. This situation is generated by two main factors that are {{the social and cultural}} characteristics of this border area, where several ethnic groups are living, and the lack of understanding of transmission dynamics of the main mosquito vector, Anopheles darlingi. In this context, entomological data collected in two villages belonging to two different ethnic groups of the French border of the Maroni River, were retrospectively analysed to find out how the mosquito bionomics are related to the malaria transmission patterns. Methods Data were provided by human landing catches of mosquitoes carried out each month for two years in two villages belonging to two ethnic groups, the Amerindians Wayanas and the Aloukous of African origin. The mosquitoes were sorted by species, sex, <b>date,</b> <b>hour</b> and place of collection and processed for Plasmodium sp. parasite detection. The data were compiled to provide the following variables: human biting rates (HBR), parity rates (PR), numbers of infective bites (IB), entomological inoculation rates (EIR) and numbers of infected mosquitoes surviving enough to transmit (IMT). Spatial and temporal differences of variables between locations and during the night were tested by the Kruskall-Wallis analysis of variance to find out significant variations. Results The populations of the main mosquito vector An. darlingi showed significant variations in the spatial and temporal HBR/person/night and HBR/person/hour, IB/person/month and IB/person/hour, and IMT/village/night and IMT/village/hour. In the village of Loca (Aloukous), the IMT peaked from June to August with a very low transmission during the other months. The risks were higher during {{the first part of the}} night and an EIR of 10 infective bites per person and per year was estimated. In the village of Twenke (Wayanas), high level of transmission was reported all year with small peaks in March and October. The risk was higher during the second part of the night and an EIR of 5 infective bites per person and per year was estimated. Conclusion For the first time in the past 40 years, the mosquito bionomics was related to the malaria transmission patterns in French Guiana. The peak of malaria cases reported from August to October in the Maroni region is concomitant with the significant peak of An. darlingi IMT, reported from the village of Loca where transmission is higher. However, the persistent number of cases reported all year long may also be related to the transmission in the Amerindian villages. The An. darlingi bionomics for these two close populations were found significantly different and may explain why a uniform vector control method is inadequate. Following these findings, malaria prevention measures adapted to the local conditions are needed. Finally, the question of the presence of An. darlingi sub-species is raised. </p...|$|E

40|$|Many provinces in Spain are {{suffering}} {{an increasing number}} of animal-car collisions in the recent years so as {{to become one of the}} main issues to the offi cial bodies with traffic and/or environmental responsibilities. In this context, the present study has been devoted to the analysis of the causes and potential solutions to the problem in the Province of Soria (Central Spain), where more than 50 percent of the reported car accidents were related in 2000 to the presence of wild animals on the road. The study was funded by the Dirección General de Medio Natural from the Consejería de Medio Ambiente of Junta de Castilla y León (the regional body in charge of game and wildlife) with a total budget of ca. $ 11, 650. The modelling has been carried out at two different spatial scales, a regional one focused oo the defi nition of the areas with high accidentality, and a local one aimed at the search of factors determining the exact locations of accidents. The study was based on the database of car acidents provided by the Dirección General de Tráfi co with indication of <b>date,</b> <b>hour</b> and location of the accident (approximated to the nearest 0. 1 km post), and species involved in the crash. This database comprised a total of 2, 067 accident locations corresponding to the 1988 - 2001 period. An initial analysis of the spatial contagion among accident locations lead to the defi nition a set of 41 “black sections” in roads, with 0. 8 to 47. 3 km length each. These sectors embrace more than 70 percent of accident locations, though totalizing only a 7. 7 percent of the road network of the province. A GIS-based analysis of the landscape features corresponding to these sectors was carried out in comparison with a set of 43 “white sections” interspersed among them. This task was based on the forest map of the province (1 : 50. 000 scale) working with 1 km radius circles centered on the midpoint of “black” and “white” sections. Nine land-use variables plus the length of ecotones and the diversity of substrata were used as input variables. The statistical analysis and the modelling showed the accident-prone areas to be characterized by their high forest cover, low presence of human structures, and a high diversity of vegetation types with some presence of crops. The analysis at the accident-point scale was carried out within a total of 18 “black sections” of roads, through a sampling of 12 points with accidents recorded and 12 free of them in each section. In each point 28 quantitative and qualitative variables were measured. The variables covered the most relevant features believed to be potentially related to accidentality, such as the road characteristics from the driver’s point of view (distance to curve, signaling), habitat structure (land-uses, distance to trees), and local morphology (natural geomorphology plus human-made structures). The statistical analyses and modelling showed the accidents happening at points of animal corridors crossing the road, with vegetation, local morphology plus human structures forcing the animals to cross at predictable points. The results thus show the potential to predict the points with higher probabilities to be accident-prone, thus opening the way for the effi cient expenditure in mitigative and preventive measures for both the problem of animal-car collisions and for the alleviation of population fragmentation by roads. Moreover, modelling points to the possibility of mitigating the problem of animal-vehicle collisions in small roads by a combination of fencing and the ubication of alternative animal passes at certain points.

40|$|The {{archipelago}} of the Azores is like {{an oasis}} {{in the middle of}} the Atlantic Ocean. Surrounded by deep waters, those islands are a “must stop” place for every traveler, including, of course, cetaceans. Around the archipelago more than 24 different species of whales and dolphins can be seen. Some of them are resident such as the common dolphin or the emblematic sperm whale. But others are seasonal or sporadic, such as the spotted dolphin or the big baleen whales. The aim of this study is to assess the temporal distribution of the baleen whales sighted off Azores. We analyzed data gathered off the south coast of São Miguel (Azores) from 2006 to 2013 from whale watching vessels. The whale watching company is located in Ponta Delgada and it works all throughout the year, always when the weather, the sea state and the number of tourists allow doing it. In Azores, whale watching companies use to locate cetaceans from land, with specialized lookouts spotting the animals from strategic points on the shore (as whalers did). These lookouts use powerful binoculars to locate the animals, and then give instructions to the boats to get to them. Once there, the boat registers <b>date,</b> <b>hour,</b> sea state, visibility, position (GPS), species, number of individuals, number of adults, juveniles and calves, behavior, association with other species and if there are other boats in the area. Photos are taken whenever it is possible and they are analyzed when the quality is good enough to distinguish natural marks and shapes. Most of the photos used in this study were taken in the last 5 years. Photo-Id catalogues were created for blue whales, fin whales and humpback whales. Data collected are more complete and frequent since 2009. In this case we have analyzed a total of 7691 sightings, belonging to 20 different species of cetaceans, 14 Odontoceti and 6 Mysticeti. In the latter group we recorded 491 sightings. The three most sighted Mysticeti species were the three great baleen whales: fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus) with 221 sightings, sei whale (Balaenoptera borealis) with 143 and blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) with 83. Those three species were sighted regularly each season every year of the study. Following them, with a much smaller number of sightings, were minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) with 16, humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) with 15 and Bryde’s whales (Balaenoptera edeni) with 13. Minke, humpback and Bryde’s whales were seen more rarely, being occasionally observed around the islands. The preferred time of the year for all species except Bryde’s, were spring months between March and June (81. 7 % of the sightings). Blue whales were more frequent in 2010 and 2012, having the highest sighting rates in May (32 sightings), April (24 sightings) and March (20 sightings), making up 91. 6 % of total blue whale records. Having into account March 2014 photos, we identified 75 different blue whales, and from those, only two were re-sighted in different years. One was firstly sighted on April 2010 with a calf and re-sighted alone on March 2014; and the other was firstly sighted on March 2012 and re-sighted on April 2014. 2013 was a good unusual year for fin whales, with a total number of 90 sightings seen mostly in may. Along the study period, we identified 45 fin whales, and at the moment, we didn’t get any match in different years or locations. Humpback whales were not sighted during 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2013, but we must bear in mind that our data from those years are incomplete (except for 2013). Nevertheless, they seem to have a slight preference for April-May as well. We photo-identified 12 individuals. One whale was re-sighted after only seven days, but there were no other re-sightings between seasons or years yet. For sei whales the best year was 2010, with 47 records. Most of records for both species were made in April and May, 66 % of the fin whales and 54 % of sei whales. Minke whales were sighted all years but 2007 and 2008. They don’t present any seasonal pattern, as they were seen in March, April, July, August and November. Bryde’s whales were sighted only in 2009 and 2013, and in both years were seen in summer (end of July-August). According to these findings we can conclude that fin whales, sei whales and blue whales are seasonal visitors in the Azores, as they are observed every year mainly in spring months between April and May. Those results agree with the hypothesis that great North Atlantic baleen whales (blue, fin and sei whales) are migratory [Olsen et al., 2009; Silva et al., 2013; Visser et al., 2011]. They pass off Azores mainly during spring months while they are travelling from their breeding grounds in low latitudes to their feeding grounds in the North Atlantic. However, if they are returning southwards to spend the winter, they have not been observed, so, if they do, they probably follow a different route. As a result, we believe that at least some blue whales usually pass along the Azores probably while they are moving to the North Atlantic feeding grounds. We have recorded two re-sightings of this species in different years, in the same area (south off São Miguel) and same time of the year (1 month lag). In another hand, we observed that minke whales, humpback whales and Bryde’s whales are only occasionally sighted around the islands. Minke and humpback don’t seem to have any preference of season, while Bryde’s were seen only in summer according to previous findings that suggest a temporal range expansion of the Eastern Atlantic population [Steiner et al., 2008]. To comprehend the occurrence of these marine mammals off Azores it would be interesting to better understand their migration and evaluate its relationship with oceanographic characteristics such as temperature, chlorophyll, currents and even geomagnetism. Next steps will be aimed at searching for these relationships and comparing our catalogues with others in the Atlantic in order to find new insights into the migration of baleen whales in the North Atlantic...|$|E
