Moreover, a host of national regulations (prudential and fiscal) will make assets expressed <b>in</b> <b>euro</b> imperfect substitutes across borders. Prudential control will also continue to be handled differently from country to country. In the long run these national indiosyncracies cannot survive competitive pressures in the e o area.

By adopting a regression quantile-based methodology, we find that after 1999 the degree of comovements among <b>euro</b> area <b>national</b> equity markets has augmented. By explicitly controlling for the impact of global factors, we show that this result cannot be explained away by recent world-wide trends. A more refined analysis based on an industry breakdown suggests that the increase in national index comovements is mainly driven by financial, industrials and consumer services sectors.
