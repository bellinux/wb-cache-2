40|$|AbstractThe {{nucleotide}} sequence of a cDNA that encodes a new regulatory subunit, named p 45, of the 265 proteasome of human hepatoblastoma HepG 2 cells has been determined. The polypeptide predicted {{from the open}} reading frame consists of 406 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular weight of 45770 and isoelectric point of 8. 35. The sequences of several fragments of bovine p 45, determined by protein chemical analyses, spanning 27 % of the complete structure, {{were found to be}} in excellent accord with those deduced from the human cDNA sequence. Computer analysis showed that p 45 belongs to a family of putative ATPases which includes regulatory components of 26 S proteasomes. The overall structure of p 45 was found to be homologous to that of yeast Suglp, which has been identified as a transcriptional factor. It is closely similar, but not identical to the sequence reported <b>for</b> <b>Tripl,</b> a functional homolog of Suglp in human tissues. These results are consistent with the possibility that Sugl-like proteins with distinct sequence function in transcription and protein degradation in human cells. However, the alternative hypothesis, that the same gene locus encodes both p 45 and Tripl, cannot be excluded on the basis of such closely similar sequences. In either case, both proteins are likely to function equivalently well in either transcription or protein degradation...|$|E
