Includes bibliographical references (page 81). To reduce the fire hazard in RMG we should look into the issue in a holistic approach both from planning and design point of view. Because a well designed factory {{will not be able}} to ensure the ultimate fire safety in RMG of Bangladesh. We need to consider the planning approach accordingly. Our survey and analysis represented that the factories in the well planned and designed EPZ, Export Processing Zone have that capacity to reduce the fire hazard risk into that zone and they have very few record of fire hazard where as the factories of Non-EPZ has the devastating <b>hazard</b> <b>record</b> even if the factory was properly designed. Ha-meem factory fire record is the example in this regards. As the factory was situated in the Non Export Processing Zone it had that limitation for fire vehicle access from the nearest fire station (about 6 km far from the factory and the travel time is 11 to 13 minutes to reach to the factory by car) it took 25 minutes to reach the location due to traffic jam, narrow and unplanned road network. Thus the emergency response time was increased. In some cases response time increased up one to two hours to reach to the location. Moreover; due to lack of standard fire separation distance between the adjacent building and community, fire spread rapidly and increase causality. According to statistic there are only 101 RMG factories are situated in the DEPZ where as we have 1654 factories are located in the Non-Export processing zone and most of these factories are developed in unplanned way in to the commercial and residential area. Most of them have not the proper facilities, equipment & fire safety practice. This paper has that suggestion to reduce the fire hazard in unplanned and non-designed factories through planning and designing approach. Although it is not possible to ensure the standard planning with same facilities like EPZ factories but it will be possible to improve the existing safety conditions and practice to ensure more safety for the millions of poor workers.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{recent years}} in Korea, Typhoon Rusa (2002), Typhoon Maemi (2003), and the {{localized}} extreme rainfall followed by Typhoon Ewiniar in 2006 devastated residential areas, roads, and agricultural lands in Gangwon province where 90 % of the area is in mountainous regions. Most of the economic losses and casualties were concentrated in the area near the mountain valleys and creeks due to the floods and debris flows. In this study, DATABASE, which includes a total 180 debris flow events in the Gangwon area, was created by collecting the <b>hazard</b> <b>records</b> and field investigations of existing debris flow sites. Analysis {{results showed that the}} most of the debris flows in Gangwon province initiated from the small slope failure with relatively steep slope of 34. 3 °.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{progress}} report of a MCEER research project {{on the development of}} multi-hazard protection technologies for critical facilities. One important component is to consider earthquake and earthquake induced hazards (e. g. fire, haz-mat leakage, power outrage, etc). This paper is concerned with earthquake and subsequent fire <b>hazards.</b> <b>Records</b> from historical earthquakes show that sometimes the damage caused by the subsequent fire can be much severer than the damage caused by the ground motion itself. This is true both for a single building and for a region. This paper presents a summary of an ongoing study on this topic by considering both single building and regional levels. At the individual building level, a performance-based analysis procedure for buildings considering earthquake and the subsequent fire is proposed. This procedure consists of four major steps: hazard analysis, structural and/or non-structural analyses, damage analysis and loss analysis. One of the key points in this procedure is that structural and/or non-structural analyses are repeated because the earthquake and the following fire are two different hazards occurring sequentially. After the earthquake, the actual status of the building needs to be evaluated, i...|$|R

40|$|High {{accident}} risk of novice and inexperienced drivers {{is associated with}} their poor hazard perception ability. In past studies, hazard perception latencies (reaction time) were measured using hazards in simulated traffic environments, scenario-based video clips, or photographs, but rarely with real-life traffic situations. We developed two different measures to assess hazard perception ability (1) video clips of <b>hazards</b> <b>recorded</b> in real-life traffic settings and (2) the video clips of animated hazards. We compared these two measures {{in terms of their}} power in discriminating between novice and experienced drivers. Novice (N= 43) and experienced drivers (N = 65) were admisistered computerbased Turkish Hazard Perception Tests consisting of 40 real traffic and animated video clips of hazards. Results revealed that although experienced drivers detected the hazards relatively earlier than the novices on average, the difference between the groups was not statistically significant for both real-traffic and video clips. Examination of the group differences on each item suggested video clips reflecting actual traffic situations discriminate novice and experienced drivers better than animated clips. Content analyses of the clips that significantly discriminated groups revealed that novice drivers have difficulty in detecting hazards resulting from an unexpected or suddent violation of road users. It seemed that lack of experience in anticipating the other road users’ violations creates a critical vulnerability for the safety of novice drivers...|$|R

40|$|Like {{all natural}} hazards, space weather {{exhibits}} occasional extreme events over timescales of decades to centuries. Historical events provoked much interest but had little economic impact. However, the widespread adoption of advanced technological infrastructures {{over the past}} fifty years gives these events the potential to disrupt those infrastructures - and thus create profound economic and societal impact. However, like all extreme hazards, such events are rare, so we have limited data on which to build our understanding of the events. Many other natural hazards (e. g. flash floods) are highly localised, so statistically significant datasets can be assembled by combining data from independent instances of the <b>hazard</b> <b>recorded</b> over a few decades. But we have a single instance of space weather so we would have to make observations for many centuries in order to build a statistically significant dataset. Instead we must exploit our knowledge of solar-terrestrial physics to find other ways to assess these risks. We discuss three alternative approaches: (a) use of proxy data, (b) studies of other solar systems, and (c) use of physics-based modelling. The proxy data approach is well-established as a technique for assessing the long-term risk from radiation storms, but does not yet provide any means to assess the risk from severe geomagnetic storms. This latter risk is more suited to the other approaches. We need to develop and expand techniques to monitoring key space weather features in other solar systems. To make progress in modelling severe space weather, {{we need to focus on}} the physics that controls severe geomagnetic storms, e. g. how can dayside and tail reconnection be modulated to expand the region of open flux to envelop mid-latitudes?Comment: Submitted to Advances in Space Researc...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—An {{excess of}} cancer was {{suspected}} by {{workers of the}} metallurgy department at the French Atomic Energy Commissariat (CEA) after several deaths from cancer were reported in 1983  and 1984.  After a descriptive study performed by the CEA in 1985  the results of which were not conclusive enough {{to put an end}} to the controversy, the present cohort study was undertaken in 1989.  METHODS—As no specific exposure, or a precise cancer site was suspected, it was decided to include all subjects who had worked at the metallurgy department for at least 1  year between 1950  and 1968.  The cohort was followed up to 31  December 1990.  Individual occupational exposures were determined retrospectively for each year from 1950  to 1990, both qualitatively (annual job, and <b>hazard</b> <b>records,</b> and assistance from former workers) and quantitatively (for external radiation). On the basis of these exposures, three types of occupational tasks were identified: handling of chemicals, radionuclides, and external radiation. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated to estimate the risk of death, and the existence of an association between risk of cancer and each of the three tasks was tested.  RESULTS—The cohort included 356  workers, followed up for an average of 30  years (total of 10   820 person-years). The number of deaths from all causes and from all cancer sites were respectively 44  and 21.  No excess of cancer deaths was found for the study period (SMR 0. 77), nor was there a peak in 1983 - 4. The risk of death from all cancer sites increased with the duration of exposure to chemicals.  CONCLUSION—The results do not justify the workers' impression of an excess of cancer. They suggest, however, that the duration of work at some tasks that involved handling chemicals may be an indicator of risk of cancer. Communication to the workers during the study played an important part in reducing their concern, contributing to their better understanding of the results.    Keywords: epidemiology; cancer; mortality; cluster; occupational exposure...|$|R
40|$|Crop frost, {{one kind}} of agro-meteorological disaster, often causes {{significant}} loss to agriculture. Thus, evaluating the risk of wheat frost aids scientific response to such disasters, which will ultimately promote food security. Therefore, this paper aims to propose an integrated risk assessment model of wheat frost, based on meteorological data and a hybrid fuzzy neural network model, taking China as an example. With {{the support of a}} geographic information system (GIS), a comprehensive method was put forward. Firstly, threshold temperatures of wheat frost at three growth stages were proposed, referring to phenology in different wheat growing areas and the meteorological standard of Degree of Crop Frost Damage (QX/T 88 - 2008). Secondly, a vulnerability curve illustrating the relationship between frost hazard intensity and wheat yield loss was worked out using hybrid fuzzy neural network model. Finally, the wheat frost risk was assessed in China. Results show that our proposed threshold temperatures are more suitable than using 0 °C in revealing the spatial pattern of frost occurrence, and hybrid fuzzy neural network model can further improve the accuracy of the vulnerability curve of wheat subject to frost with limited historical <b>hazard</b> <b>records.</b> Both these advantages ensure the precision of wheat frost risk assessment. In China, frost widely distributes in 85. 00 % of the total winter wheat planting area, but mainly to the north of 35 °N; the southern boundary of wheat frost has moved northward, potentially because of the warming climate. There is a significant trend that suggests high risk areas will enlarge and gradually expand to the south, with the risk levels increasing from a return period of 2 years to 20 years. Among all wheat frost risk levels, the regions with loss rate ranges from 35. 00 % to 45. 00 % account for the largest area proportion, ranging from 58. 60 % to 63. 27 %. We argue that for wheat and other frost-affected crops, it is necessary to take the risk level, physical exposure, and growth stages of crops into consideration together for frost disaster risk prevention planning...|$|R
