I've got a <b>knife.</b> Let's <b>dig</b> out that stuff and lift up the lid before the darkies come back. If we find any dead bodies inside this tomb, they will frighten those fellows to death, if they {{catch sight of}} them." ...|$|R
25|$|When {{the order}} Na shturm, marshch! (Assault, march!) was given, the Soviet {{infantry}} would charge the enemy with shouting the traditional Russian battle cry Urra! (pronounced oo-rah, {{which comes from}} the Turkish word to kill), the sound of which many German veterans found terrifying. During the charge, the riflemen would fire with rifles and submachine guns while throwing grenades before closing in for blizhnii boi (close combat) as close quarter fighting with guns, bayonets, rifle butts, <b>knives,</b> <b>digging</b> tools and their fists were known, a type of fighting that the Red Army excelled at. On the defensive, the frontovik were well known for their skill at camouflaging their positions and for being disciplined enough to withhold fire until the Germans were at close range. Before 1941 Red Army doctrine had called for opening fire at maximum range, but it was quickly discovered that it was preferable to ambush the Germans with surprise fire at close ranges from multiple positions.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can eat {{much better}} without," [...] said Lavo; but to please Lucy his sister did try; {{slashing}} hard {{away with her}} <b>knife,</b> and <b>digging</b> her fork straight into a bit of meat. Then she very nearly ran it into her eye, and Lucy, who knew it was not good manners to laugh, was very near choking herself. And at last saying the knife and fork were [...] "Great good--great good; but none for eating," [...] they stuck them through the great tortoise shell rings they had in their ears and noses. Lucy was distressed about Uncle Joseph's knives and forks, which she knew she ought not to give away; but while she was looking about for Mrs. Bunker to interfere, Don seemed to think it his business and began to growl and fly at the little black legs.|$|R
2500|$|Considered handsome, Roy Bean {{competed for}} the attentions of various local women. A Scotsman named Collins {{challenged}} Bean to a pistol-shooting match on horseback. Bean {{was left to}} choose the targets, and decided that they would shoot at each other. The duel was fought on February 24, 1852, ending with Collins receiving a wound to his right arm. [...] Both men were {{arrested and charged with}} assault with intent to murder. In the twomonths that he was in jail, Bean received many gifts of flowers, food, wine, and cigars from women in San Diego. His final gift while incarcerated included knives encased in tamales. Bean used the <b>knives</b> to <b>dig</b> through the cell wall. After escaping on April 17, Bean moved to San Gabriel, California, where he became a bartender in his brother's saloon, the Headquarters Saloon. After Joshua was murdered in November, [...] Bean inherited the saloon.|$|R
5|$|The film {{begins with}} Jack Sparks, a young American, who is {{traveling}} in Turkey. He befriends an aged Turk during a carriage ride and the Turk invites Jack into his home. The man smokes from a hookah {{and several of}} other men arrive and speak with the Turk whilst Jack wanders about the house. Soon afterwards, the men are all arrested for conspiracy against the government and Jack is imprisoned {{as one of the}} conspirators. In jail, Jack tries to make his escape and throws the guard to the ground, no sooner has he left the cell is he forced back by two more guards. He struggles in vain, but is once again locked in his cell. Jack gets an idea to escape when he sees the bed sheet and the cell window. Using his pocket <b>knife,</b> he <b>digs</b> out the bar of the cell window and drops to freedom. He struggles and overpowers a guard before climbing over the wall and into the courtyard of the Pasha's palace.|$|R
5000|$|On 28 April NLA insurgents killed eight Macedonian male commandos in the Macedonian Army Special Forces, {{also known}} as [...] "Wolves" [...] (Volci), in an ambush {{near the village of}} Vejce, nine miles north of Tetovo. According to the {{eyewitness}} account of the only Macedonian soldier who managed to escape the ambush, the assailants were bearded men. The killing shocked public opinion because the reportedly bearded assailants used <b>knives</b> to <b>dig</b> out the eyes and cut off the ears and genitals of the Macedonian soldiers while the soldiers were still alive, and raised once again haunting questions concerning the origin of the people who committed these atrocious acts. The mutilation of the commandos' bodies, together with rumors about mujahideen groups operating in Macedonia, motivated people to action: in the city of Bitola (home of four of the commandos), Macedonians formed community self-defense groups; in Skopje, gunmen in a passing car opened fire on the Albanian Embassy and on an Albanian-owned pizzeria, killing an Albanian man; businesses and stores of Albanians and other Muslims in both cities were looted or burned.|$|R
5000|$|Scahill's book {{published}} by Nation Books, Dirty Wars: The World Is a Battlefield, released on April 23, 2013. The main {{premise of the}} book is Obama's continuation of Bush's doctrine that [...] "the world is a battlefield" [...] and relying on missiles and drone strikes, JSOC to carry the bulk of the covert operations and targeted killings of suspected terrorists. Scahill expands on this theme by covering topics such as the assassination of U.S. citizens, namely Anwar Awlaki and his 16-year-old son Abdulrahman Anwar al-Awlaki, and the lack of accountability of U.S. special forces, such as the Gardez massacre, where U.S. special forces killed two males, including the pro-U.S. local police commander, as well as three females, two of whom were pregnant. An Afghan investigation found signs of evidence tampering, such as bullets being removed from the wall where the women were shot. Several family members of the victims alleged that the special forces subsequently used their <b>knives</b> to <b>dig</b> the bullets out of the bodies and cleaned the resultant wounds to purge any evidence of the U.S. raid.|$|R
5000|$|Following initial interrogation, James and a {{small band}} of others were taken to Berlin and paraded through the capital. [...] "It was a rather ghastly affair really. They weren't hostile, as the bombing hadn't really started, but we were rather curious to them, I suppose". From Berlin, James was moved to the {{notoriously}} bleak Stalag Luft 1 at Barth on the northern coast of Germany. The camp was still under construction {{at this stage of the}} war and the reality was that the Germans were only slowly coming to terms with POWs. Within a matter of days, Jimmy and W/Cdr John 'Death' Shore were planning an escape - the route was to be via the camp incinerator. Digging a highly audacious tunnel, John Shore managed to clear the wire and escape, whilst Jimmy was caught in the act and sent directly to the cooler. Over the next five years, he made thirteen efforts to escape from various prisons and camps, including Stalag Luft III, the site in March 1944 of the so-called Great Escape. A central figure in the story of the Great Escape, Jimmy James, together with Peter Fanshawe, was largely responsible for depositing the soil from Tunnel Harry under seat 13 in the camp theatre (built by prisoners). On the night of the escape, 24 March 1944, James and his partner, Pilot Officer Sotirios (Nick) Skantzikas, were disguised as Yugoslav workers trying to get home. Known as the 'hardarsers' group, they and others made their way south from the camp to the tiny rail stop at Tchiebsdorf (now Trzebów) about 8 km south of Sagan. After a treacherous night of walking through deep snow to reach Hirschberg, James and Skantzikas eventually found their way to Hirschberg West station and, attempting to purchase a ticket south, the two were arrested by the Criminal Police (Kripo) and taken to the Gestapo HQ in the town. Following a transfer to the local prison, Skanzikas was taken out to be shot, whilst James remained in his cell totally unaware of why he was saved from execution. In Berlin, SS-Gruppenführer Nebe was ordered by Heinrich Müller, Chief of the Gestapo, to select and kill fifty of the seventy-three recaptured prisoners in what became known as the [...] "Stalag Luft III murders". Fifty were then executed, James being one of a handful sent instead to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. On 23 September 1944, James escaped from Sachsenhausen, accompanied by Jack Churchill, Harry Day, Johnnie Dodge and Sydney Dowse using small cutlery <b>knives</b> to <b>dig</b> an escape tunnel over 110 metres long. On the run for several weeks, he was finally arrested in Pomerania before being transferred back to solitary confinement in Sachsenhausen. James's cell was tiny, just enough to stand up and stretch. For over 4 months Jimmy James suffered daily harassment from the guards, mock executions and, of course, virtually no food. As the Red Army was approaching, the SS decided to move the 'Prominente' prisoners further south, possibly to act as a bargaining chip with the Allies - though this has never been confirmed. Following a torturous journey via Dachau and Flossenburg concentration camps, James and other Prominente were moved to the South Tyrol where they were eventually liberated by partisans and US Army troops in May 1945.|$|R
