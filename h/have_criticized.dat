5|$|By February, the Germans were in full retreat. On February 23, 1945, the U.S. 94th Infantry Division {{crossed the}} Saar and {{established}} a vital bridgehead at Serrig through which Patton pushed units into the Saarland. Patton had insisted upon an immediate crossing of the Saar River {{against the advice of}} his officers. Historians such as Charles Whiting <b>have</b> <b>criticized</b> this strategy as unnecessarily aggressive.|$|E

5|$|Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation <b>have</b> <b>criticized</b> the Debian {{project for}} hosting the non-free {{repository}} {{and because the}} contrib and non-free areas are easily accessible, an opinion echoed by some in Debian including the former project leader Wichert Akkerman. The internal dissent in the Debian project regarding the non-free section has persisted, but the last time {{it came to a}} vote in 2004, the majority decided to keep it.|$|E
5|$|Students pay $20 per {{semester}} to {{fund the}} functions of the ASMSU, including stipends for the organization's officers and activities throughout the year. Some students <b>have</b> <b>criticized</b> ASMSU for not having enough electoral participation to gain a student mandate.

5|$|William Burdick, Mark Hauswald, and Kenneth Iserson <b>have</b> <b>criticized</b> {{the above}} {{definition}} as oxymoronic, given the international nature {{of medicine and}} the number of physicians working internationally. From that point of view, international emergency medicine is not solely about development of emergency medical systems but is instead better described as the training required for and the reality of practicing the specialty outside of one's native country.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors, {{including}} the bizarre facts and Cardozo's outstanding reputation, {{made the case}} prominent in the legal profession, and it remains so, taught to {{most if not all}} American law students in torts class. Cardozo's conception, that tort liability only occurs when a defendant breaches a duty of care the defendant owes to a plaintiff, causing the injury sued for, has been widely accepted in American law. In dealing with proximate cause, many states have taken the approach championed by the Court of Appeals' dissenter in Palsgraf, Judge William S. Andrews. Some legal scholars in recent years <b>have</b> <b>criticized</b> Cardozo for not taking into account Palsgraf's impoverished circumstances.|$|E
5|$|As the Union army approached, Lee {{chose to}} make a stand at Sharpsburg, Maryland along Antietam Creek. On September 17, 1862, the armies engaged in the Battle of Antietam. The V Corps was held in reserve {{in the center of}} Union lines during the battle. The 22nd had a clear view of both flanks of the Union army and watched the assaults that took place {{over the course of the}} day. The V Corps, however, took no part in these assaults. Historians <b>have</b> <b>criticized</b> McClellan for his uncoordinated attacks at Antietam and for not {{committing}} the V Corps which might have broken Lee's army.|$|E

Instead, a wheelchair lift was installed, but it proved not to work. The area around the doors are step-free from the platform, but within the trains steps {{must be taken to}} reach the seating area. The Norwegian Federation of Organisations of Disabled People <b>have</b> <b>criticized</b> Flytoget for ordering identical additional cars that will not ease access for the disabled.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{said to be the}} largest non-wax Christmas candle in the country. Although {{conceived}} with the hopes of restoring Easton's pre-20th century reputation for elaborate Christmas decorations, city officials also believed a candle would serve as a symbol of peace for all religions and denominations. Due to its symbolism for peace and its placement over a Civil War monument, the candle has been the site of several anti-war protests over the decades. Some <b>have</b> <b>criticized</b> the Peace Candle, calling it a symbol of the over-commercialization of Christmas, and condemning the fact that it covers a war monument.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scholars}} and readers <b>have</b> <b>criticized</b> {{the book for}} what are seen as condescending racist descriptions of the book's black characters, {{especially with regard to}} the characters' appearances, speech, and behavior, as well as the passive nature of Uncle Tom in accepting his fate. The novel's creation and use of common stereotypes about African Americans is significant because Uncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling novel in the world during the 19th century. As a result, the book (along with illustrations from the book and associated stage productions) {{played a major role in}} permanently ingraining these stereotypes into the American psyche.|$|E

5|$|Murder on the Orient Express is {{the first}} game in the Agatha Christie series to feature Hercule Poirot, Christie's most popular and famous detective. David Suchet, whose {{portrayal}} of Poirot achieved fame through the popular television series Agatha Christie's Poirot, was hired to provide Poirot's voice. His performance was generally met with praise. Some <b>have</b> <b>criticized</b> the game for not allowing the player to actually control Poirot; the developers explained this choice by saying that adventure gamers who make mistakes throughout the game {{do not reflect the}} genius of Poirot, but are better represented by amateur sleuth Antoinette Marceau.|$|E
5|$|Retaliatory punishments, or Qisas, are practised: for instance, an eye can be surgically removed at {{the insistence}} of a victim who lost his own eye. This {{occurred}} in a case reported in 2000. Families of someone unlawfully killed can choose between demanding the death penalty or granting clemency in return for a payment of diyya, or blood money, by the perpetrator. There has been a growing trend of exorbitant blood-money demands, for example a sum of $11 million was reported as being recently demanded. Saudi officials and religious figures <b>have</b> <b>criticized</b> this trend and said that the practise of diyya has become corrupted.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{have liked}} finding contradictions; a common complaint, however, is the games' linearity, {{as well as}} how the player {{sometimes}} has to resort to a trial-and-error method due to the games only accepting specific pieces of evidence, and how testimony statements sometimes need to be pressed in a specific order. Some reviewers <b>have</b> <b>criticized</b> the lack of changes to the gameplay and presentation throughout the series, while some have said that fans of the series would not have a problem with this.|$|E

5|$|Shirokogoroff's and Eliade's {{views of}} shamanism were both {{centered}} on individuals {{and on the}} role of shamans in small groups. Shirokogoroff, for instance, considered eighteenth-century Qing shamanism too formalized to be authentic. Historians of northeast Asia <b>have</b> <b>criticized</b> Eliade's and Shirokogoroff's interpretations because they neglect the political roles of shamans and shamanism's relation with the state. Eliade's claim that shamanism is by essence archaic, individualistic, and socially transgressive led him and his followers to neglect historical contexts in which shamanism fulfilled political functions or served the needs of the state, as it did under the Qing.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{has been}} called a masterpiece depiction of a battle scene, and much more than a simple depiction of a bloody battle. It is a complex picture, requiring more than a cursory look; a French critic, viewing it in Paris in 1879, declared that it was a museum in its own right, requiring eight days of study before one could properly appreciate it. At the same time, critics have pointed to the unrealistic depiction of the battle, and some anachronistic accessories present in the painting. Others <b>have</b> <b>criticized</b> the painting for being too crowded and chaotic.|$|E
5|$|Wines {{from the}} Languedoc can carry an {{enormous}} number of names, ranging from broad regional designations like Vin de Pays d'Oc to very specific geographical classifications with restrictions on grape variety, like Corbières and Minervois. Since the 1990s, the INAO has been creating smaller AOC classifications which take into account the intricate microclimates and soil variations in the Languedoc-Roussillon. Younger appellations like the Cabardes and subregions like Minervois la Livinière, Corbières-Boutenac and St-Chinian-Berlou are much smaller in scope. While these new appellations have been praised for consistently improving their product, others <b>have</b> <b>criticized</b> the additions for further complicating an already esoteric system of classification.|$|E
