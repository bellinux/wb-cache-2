500|$|At midnight, the French ships {{crossed the}} bows of the convoy and by morning were [...] to windward, to the south. Troubridge {{maintained}} his line {{throughout the night}} and at 07:00 on 7 August 1805 he prepared to receive the French again as Linois bore down on the convoy. Retaining their formation, the combined batteries of the Indiamen and Blenheim dissuaded Linois from the pressing the attack and he veered off at [...] distance, holding position {{for the rest of}} the day before turning southwards at 21:00 and disappearing. Troubridge wanted to pursue in Blenheim, but was dissuaded by the presence of Belle Poule, which could attack the convoy while the ships of the line were engaged. He expressed confidence however that he would have been successful in any engagement and wrote [...] "I trust I shall yet <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> fortune to fall in with him when unencumber'd with convoy". Linois's withdrawal was prudent: his mainmast had been struck during the brief cannonade and was at risk of collapse if the engagement continued. Losses among the crew were light, Marengo suffering eight men wounded and Belle Poule none. British casualties were slightly heavier, a passenger on Blenheim named Mr. Cook was killed by langrage shot and a sailor was killed on the Indiaman Ganges by a roundshot. No British ships suffered anything more than superficial damage in the combat, and the convoy continued its journey uninterrupted, arriving at Madras on 23 August.|$|E
2500|$|His father (Abba [...] ), who {{subsequently}} {{was known}} {{also by the}} Aramaic language designation Abuh di-Shemu'el ("father of Samuel"), was a silk-merchant. R. Judah ben Bathyra ordered a silken garment from him, but refused to take it after Abba had procured it, and when the latter asked him the reason of his refusal, R. Judah answered, [...] "The commission was only a spoken word, and was not sufficient to make the transaction binding." [...] Abba thereupon said, [...] "Is the word of a sage not a better guarantee than his money?" [...] "You are right," [...] said R. Judah; [...] "and because you lay so much stress upon a given word you shall <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> fortune of having a son who shall be like the prophet Samuel, and whose word all Israel will recognize as true." [...] Soon afterward a son was born to Abba, whom he named Samuel (Midr. Shemu'el, x. [...] ).|$|E

2500|$|Sheshet devoted {{much time}} to Biblical exegesis, and {{whenever}} he recapitulated his studies, as was his custom {{at the end of}} every thirty days, he used to say: [...] "Rejoice, my soul! rejoice, my soul! For thy sake have I read the Holy Scriptures; and for thy sake have I studied the Mishnah and the baraitot" [...] (Pes. 68b). He took comparatively little interest, on the other hand, in the Aggadah, and he himself acknowledged his shortcoming in this respect, saying: [...] "I cannot dispute with Ḥana on the Aggadah" [...] (Suk. 52b, and Rashi ad loc.). Some of his haggadic interpretations of Biblical passages, referring for the most part to studies of the Law, have been preserved. Thus, he interpreted Prov. xi. 25 as implying that whoever teaches in this world will <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> fortune to teach in the world to come also (Sanh. 92a); and in Shab. 63a he explains Prov. iii. 16 as meaning that whosoever studies in the right manner receives as his reward length of days in addition to riches and honor, but that he who studies in a fashion not altogether unimpeachable receives riches and honor without length of days. He frequently elucidated Biblical passages by the application of well-known proverbs (Ber. 32a; Sanh. 105a).|$|E
