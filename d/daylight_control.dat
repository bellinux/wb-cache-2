Automated <b>daylight</b> <b>control</b> systems are part of a growing industry, based on complex electronics and careful placing of light sensors. In an economy that is accepting the need for energy reduction due to the realisation of limited fossil fuels, it is important to maintain and enhance energy efficient systems. Research highlighted that previous studies would either use a physical measuring approach or an occupant survey to understand how well automated <b>daylight</b> <b>control</b> systems are working, but never both. This thesis combined both of these approaches to quantify how much energy automated <b>daylight</b> <b>control</b> systems are saving while ensuring that occupant satisfaction and comfort is maintained. Four office buildings within Wellington city were therefore analysed to investigate the average energy saving from automated <b>daylight</b> <b>control</b> systems. Energy savings reported from other research studies ranged from 15 % to 80 %, with an average of 49 %. The savings from the four buildings researched in this thesis average 20 % savings.

This paper presents the results of a 1 -year monitoring campaign in 3 classrooms of a school in Belgium in which a <b>daylight</b> <b>controlled</b> dimming system was installed.

However, their energy saving potential cannot be estimated accurately because it depends on several building and system parameters, climate conditions, occupant behaviour and type and commissioning of the <b>daylight</b> <b>control</b> system. The objective {{of this paper is}} to compare the energy saving potential and operation of different <b>daylight</b> <b>control</b> systems in school buildings. One year monitoring has been carried out simultaneously in 3 neighbouring classrooms, equipped with a different type of control system. The active power and the electric energy consumption of the artificial lighting were measured continuously on a minute-by-minute basis, as well as the occupancy of the classrooms and the global irradiance outside the building under an unobstructed horizon. Momentary visual comfort assessments were carried out in the classrooms. Although all classrooms have comparable occupancy and identical building characteristics, differences between the annual energy savings of the different <b>daylight</b> <b>control</b> systems are found to be significant: the total annual energy savings varied from 18 % to 46 %. Under the given conditions, the open loop system with the outward facing daylight sensor was noticed to yield the largest while the closed loop system with centrally positioned sensor produced the smallest savings. However, it has to be made sure that the energy savings are not at the expense of the visual comfort. The performance of the systems regarding both energy savings and visual comfort is related to the operation and the initial commissioning. An in-depth analysis of the monitoring campaign is discussed to explain the differences in energy savings and visual comfort. The energy savings due to the implementation of a <b>daylight</b> <b>control</b> system are divided into on the one hand dimming due to daylight penetration and on the other hand initial dimming to compensate for the over dimensioning of the lighting system and to take into account constant illuminance control. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Heating, cooling and {{lighting}} are the dominant sectors of energy consumption in commercial buildings. Controlling solar radiation through windows {{will improve the}} illuminance distribution as well as energy efficiency of buildings. Advanced window systems with motorized shading controlled in conjunction with light dimming constitute a promising approach for improving energy efficiency of buildings. However, the performance of current <b>controlled</b> <b>daylighting</b> systems is neither sufficiently reliable nor accurate, thereby reducing their widespread adoption. The uncertainty of light dimming control system performance {{is largely due to}} prediction of workplane illuminance. This makes the system unreliable and sometimes more complex. To improve the performance of light dimming control systems, the prediction of the workplane illuminance must be considered first. Without thorough understanding of systems, their control may not be achieved efficiently. A new daylight prediction method, Illuminance Ratio Prediction (IRP) method, is proposed in this thesis for an integrated <b>daylighting</b> <b>control</b> system. The proposed method, which is theoretically developed based on radiosity theory, shows that the illuminance ratio of two arbitrary surfaces in a space in the presence of one initial light source with varying quantity at a fixed location is always constant. The proposed method was experimentally proved. With the IRP method, reliable and accurate predictions of daylighting parameters such as the workplane illuminance, the exterior vertical illuminance and the solar heat gains through the window systems, were obtained as the basis for development of an integrated <b>daylighting</b> <b>control</b> methodology. The methodology was validated in an outdoor test-room with dimmable electric lighting and a window with built-in motorized blinds. The algorithm was calibrated with a workplane sensor control. Then, an integrated <b>daylighting</b> <b>control</b> system using an interior front wall sensor for prediction was successfully tested. It was found that this system could maintain both the workplane illuminance level and the solar heat gains at the desirable level by simultaneous controls of light dimming and blind tilt angle. With active <b>daylighting</b> <b>control,</b> significant energy savings may be achieved in energy consumption for lighting and cooling. One important asset of the methodology developed is that motorized blinds are optimally tilted so as to admit just enough daylight to satisfy workplane illuminance requirements predicted with IRP method, thus reducing cooling loads due to potential excessive solar gains...|$|R

Due to the control strategy for a stable behavior of the automatic lighting control system without or with acceptable overshoot (regarding the control system step response) the learning rate of the FANN needs to have very small values and in a short range.

So far studies on plant {{responses to}} spectra either use no <b>daylight</b> <b>control</b> or, if a natural <b>daylight</b> <b>control</b> is used, it will fluctuate in intensity and spectrum. An artificial solar (AS) spectrum which closely resembles a sunlight spectrum has been engineered, and growth, morphogenesis, and photosynthetic characteristics of cucumber plants grown for 13 d under this spectrum have been compared with their performance under fluorescent tubes (FTs) and a high pressure sodium lamp (HPS). The total dry weight of the AS-grown plants was 2. 3 and 1. 6 times greater than that of the FT and HPS plants, respectively, and the height of the AS plants was 4 – 5 times greater. This striking difference appeared to be related to a more efficient light interception by the AS plants, characterized by longer petioles, a greater leaf unfolding rate, and a lower investment in leaf mass relative to leaf area. Photosynthesis per leaf area was not greater for the AS plants. The extreme differences in plant response to the AS spectrum compared with the widely used protected cultivation light sources tested highlights the importance of a more natural spectrum, such as the AS spectrum, if the aim is to produce plants representative of field condition...|$|E

We present results from 14 months of tuning the system design and monitoring energy performance and control system operations. For this southeast-facing office, we found that 1 - 22 % lighting energy savings, 13 - 28 % cooling load reductions, and 13 - 28 % peak cooling load reductions {{can be achieved by}} the dynamic system under clear sky and overcast conditions year round, compared to a static, partly closed blind with the same optimized <b>daylighting</b> <b>control</b> system. These energy savings increase if compared to conventional <b>daylighting</b> <b>controls</b> with manually-operated blinds. Monitored data indicated that the control system met design objectives under all weather conditions to within 10 % for at least 90 % of the year. A pilot human factors study indicated that some of our default control settings should be adjusted to increase user satisfaction. With these adjustments, energy savings will decrease. The final prototype design yielded a 10 -year simple payback for this site. If mechanical system downsizing opportunities and qualitative improvements to worker's comfort are included, this innovative technology could be more cost effective. Marketing information for commercializing this technology is given...|$|R
