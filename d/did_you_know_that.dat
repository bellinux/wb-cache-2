That evening, the President {{attended}} the annual White House Correspondent's Association dinner, which was hosted by comedian and television actor Seth Meyers. At one point, Meyers joked: [...] "People think bin Laden is hiding in the Hindu Kush, but <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> every day from 4 to 5 he hosts a show on C-SPAN?" [...] Obama laughed, despite {{his knowledge of the}} operation to come.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} met with mixed to {{positive}} reviews. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an [...] "A–", applauded Duchovny's apparent energy to be acting on the series once again. However, {{he felt that the}} [...] "overtness" [...] of the episode resulted in many scenes coming off as too on-the-nose or strained. Television Without Pity gave the episode a B– rating but slightly criticized the way Fox was using Duchovny, sardonically writing, [...] "I don't know if you're aware of this, but David Duchovny stars in The X-Files. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that?</b> Because they've really been keeping it under wraps at Fox." [...] John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a 7 out of 10 rating. Keegan called the episode a [...] "homage to fandom" [...] and described the tone as [...] "warm [...] fuzzy." [...] Because of this, he concluded that [...] "verall, this was an episode that dealt with the emotional needs of the audience {{in a way that was}} less effective than it might have been." ...|$|E

2500|$|Within days of Giancana's murder, Willow Springs {{police chief}} and Outfit {{associate}} Michael J. Corbitt discussed the murder with capo Salvatore Bastone. Bastone told him, [...] "You know, Sam sure loved that little guy in Oak Park... Tony Spilotro. Yeah, he was fuckin' crazy about him. Sam put Tony on the fuckin' map, {{thought he was}} gonna be a big fuckin' man someday. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> after Marshall Caifano got out of Vegas, it was Sam who wanted Tony Spilotro out there? Even lately, with all {{the problems with the}} skim and all, Sam always stood behind the guy. Tony was over to Sam's house all the time. He lived right by there. Did you know Tony even figured out a way where he could get in through the back of Sam's place without anybody seeing him? He'd go through other people's yards, go over fences, all sorts of shit." ...|$|E

2500|$|The title {{refers to}} a passage {{about the end of}} the world from the Book of Revelation, used both at the very start of the film, and again towards the end, {{beginning}} with the words [...] "And when the Lamb had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour" [...] (Revelation 8:1). Thus, in the confessional scene the knight states: [...] "Is it so cruelly inconceivable to grasp God with the senses? Why should He hide himself in a mist of half-spoken promises and unseen miracles?...What is going to happen to those of us who want to believe but aren't able to?" [...] Death, impersonating the confessional priest, refuses to reply. Similarly, later, as he eats the strawberries with the family of actors, Antonius Block says: [...] "Faith is a torment – <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that?</b> It is like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call." [...] Bragg notes that the concept of the [...] "Silence of God" [...] in the face of evil, or the pleas of believers or would-be-believers, may be influenced by the punishments of silence meted out by Bergman's father, a chaplain in the State Lutheran Church. Interestingly, in Bergman's original radio play sometimes translated as A Painting on Wood, the figure of Death in a Dance of Death is represented not by an actor, but by silence, [...] "mere nothingness, mere absence...terrifying...the void." ...|$|E
2500|$|Griffin is {{sometimes}} {{the object of}} her own humor, {{particularly with regard to}} her D-list status. While Griffin paints herself as a Hollywood outsider, she has a group of close celebrity friends such as Rosie O'Donnell, Joan Rivers, Jerry Seinfeld, Gloria Estefan, Whoopi Goldberg, Jennifer Coolidge, Rachel True, Larry David, Ricky Gervais, Anderson Cooper, Cher and Lance Bass. Griffin's longtime friendship with Bass was the catalyst for a feud between her and gossip blogger Perez Hilton, in which Griffin expressed anger over Hilton's [...] "outing" [...] of Bass on his website, calling Hilton's attacks on Bass [...] "mean" [...] and [...] "unfunny". Hilton responded by saying that Griffin's anger was hypocritical, considering all of the gay jokes she makes about Clay Aiken in her stand-up routines. In 2007, Griffin commented on her aversion to making fun of celebrity friends by saying, [...] "There's nothing I won't do, {{but on the other hand}} I'm full of shit because that changes. For example, you know Lance Bass from 'N Sync and how he's gay now? All those years that I knew he was gay, he and I were friends, I would never say, 'Hey, by the way, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Lance Bass is gay?'" [...] Griffin and Hilton ended their feud after the death of Griffin's father, and Hilton appeared on an episode of her show in 2007. Yet in July 2008, he asserted that Griffin's assistant Jessica Zajicek had quit because she could not take Griffin's now hectic career. Griffin dismissed these statements as false as Zajicek is still working for Griffin. However, the season premiere of The D-List depicted that Zajicek was no longer working for Griffin; Griffin explained early in the episode that Zajicek [...] "has decided to move on".|$|E
