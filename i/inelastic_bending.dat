40|$|<b>Inelastic</b> <b>bending</b> {{capacity}} {{exists in}} cold-formed steel beams, despite their fundamentally thin-walled nature. In this paper a simple design procedure {{to account for}} this increased bending capacity is proposed as an extension to the Direct Strength Method of cold-formed steel member design. Using an experimental test database of over 500 flexural tests on cold-formed steel beams approximately 100 tests are found where the bending capacity reaches 95 %My or greater including observations as high as 118 %My, where My is the moment at first yield. Using elementary beam mechanics, and assuming elastic-perfectly plastic material, the inelastic compressive strain at failure is back-calculated for the tested members. The tested members are augmented by a detailed finite element study of inelastic local and distortional buckling and the inelastic strains {{as well as the}} peak moments sustained are examined. The models demonstrate the limitations of the elementary mechanics model which can predict average membrane strains in the compressive flange reasonably well, but maximum membrane strains and surface strains are significantly larger. Simple relationships between local and distortional cross-section slenderness to predict average inelastic strain demands and a relationship between average strain demand and <b>inelastic</b> <b>bending</b> strength are established. These relationships are combined to provide direct design expressions that connect cross-section slenderness in local or distortional buckling with the <b>inelastic</b> <b>bending</b> strength of cold-formed steel beams...|$|E
40|$|Small-scale {{effects in}} carbon {{nanotubes}} are effectively assessed by resorting to {{the methods of}} nonlocal continuum mechanics. The crucial point of this approach consists in defining suitable constitutive laws which lead to reliable results. A nonlocal elastic law, diffusely adopted in literature, is that proposed by Eringen. According to this theory, the elastic equilibrium problem of a nonlocal nanostructure is equivalent {{to that of a}} corresponding local nanostructure subjected to suitable distortions simulating the nonlocality effect. Accordingly, transverse displacements and bending moments of a Bernoulli–Euler nonlocal nanobeam can be obtained by solving a corresponding linearly elastic (local) nanobeam, subjected to the same loading and kinematic constraint conditions of the nonlocal nanobeam, but with the prescription of suitable <b>inelastic</b> <b>bending</b> curvature fields. This observation leads naturally to the definition of a higher-order Eringen version for Bernoulli–Euler nanobeams, in which the elastic energy is assumed to be dependent on the total and <b>inelastic</b> <b>bending</b> curvatures and on their derivatives. Weak and strong formulations of elastic equilibrium of first-order gradient nanobeams are provided by a consistent thermodynamic approach. Exact solutions of fully clamped and cantilever nanobeams are given and compared with those of literature...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} {{presented}} here was to evaluate the residual stresses present in a bar of aluminium alloy 2124 -T 1 matrix composite (MMC) reinforced with 25 vol% particulate silicon carbide (SiCp) using X-ray diffraction and 3 D profilometry (curvature measurement using Mitutoyo/Renishaw coordinate measurement machine) and comparing these results with numerical models of residual strain and stress profiles obtained by a simple <b>inelastic</b> <b>bending</b> model and Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The residual strain distribution was introduced into the test piece by plastic deformation in the 4 -point bending configuration. At {{the first stage of}} this study the elastic-plastic behaviour of the MMC was characterized under static and cyclic loading to obtain the material parameters, hardening proprieties and cyclic hysteresis loops. Subsequently, synchrotron X-ray diffraction and CMM curvature measurements were performed to deduce the residual stress profile in the central section of the bar.

The analysis is carried out numerically by assuming the degrading type of stress-strain relation that represents the effect of local buckling. The biaxial moment-curvature relation is obtained for a beam-column which is subjected to the cyclic or monotonic loading {{in such a way}} that the curvatures about principal axes change in a fixed proportion.

40|$|AbstractA {{smoothed}} inverse eigenstrain {{method is}} developed for reconstruction of residual field from limited strain measurements. A framework for appropriate choice of shape functions {{based on the}} prior knowledge of expected residual distribution is presented which results in stabilized numerical behavior. The analytical method is successfully applied to three case studies where residual stresses are introduced by <b>inelastic</b> beam <b>bending,</b> laser-forming and shot peening. The well-rehearsed advantage of the proposed eigenstrain-based formulation is that it not only minimizes the deviation of measurements from its approximations but also will result in an inverse solution satisfying {{a full range of}} continuum mechanics requirements. The smoothed inverse eigenstrain approach allows suppressing fluctuations that are contrary to the physics of the problem. Furthermore, a comprehensive discussion is performed on regularity of the asymptotic solution in the Tikhonov scheme and the regularization parameter is then exactly determined utilizing Morozov discrepancy principle. Gradient iterative regularization method is also examined and shown to have an excellent convergence to the Tikhonov–Morozov regularization results...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental study on the section moment capacity of cold-formed steel beams with rectangular hollow flanges. The new Rectangular Hollow Flange Beam (RHFB) is fabricated using a unique manufacturing process in which two cold-formed rectangular hollow flanges are screw fastened to a web plate. It possesses unique stress-strain characteristics and initial imperfections that are different from conventional open cold-formed steel sections and welded hollow flange beam sections. In this study, the section moment capacity of RHFBs was investigated using a series of full scale bending tests. Twenty two section moment capacity tests of RHFBs were conducted on short span flexural members with simply supported end conditions for three steel grades G 300, G 500 and G 550 and varying thicknesses. Test capacity results were compared with the capacities predicted by the current design rules in the Australian and North American steel design standards, AS 4100, AS/NZS 4600 and AISI S 100, to verify their applicability to RHFBs. The results show that although the current design rules based on effective width principles predicted the section moment capacities of RHFBs slightly unconservatively in comparison to test results, they can be used for RHFBs provided a suitable screw spacing is used. However, the Direct Strength Method (DSM) based design rules are found to predict the section moment capacity of this new screw-fastened hollow flange beam section conservatively in most cases. This research shows that the DSM based design rules including the new <b>inelastic</b> reserve <b>bending</b> capacity provisions in AISI S 100 can be used to predict the section moment capacities of both screw-fastened and welded hollow flange beam sections conservatively...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThin-walled steel {{circular}} {{hollow sections}} (CHSs) {{are widely used}} in wind turbine towers. The tower tubes are mainly subjected to bending. There {{have been a few}} experimental studies on the bending behavior of thin-walled CHS steel tubes. This paper describes a series of bending tests to examine the influence of section slenderness on the <b>inelastic</b> and elastic <b>bending</b> properties of thin-walled CHS. In addition, the influence of stiffeners welded in the steel tube is considered. Sixteen bending tests were performed up to failure on different sizes of CHS with diameter-to-thickness ratio (D/t) varying from 75 to 300. The experimental results showed that the specimens with small diameter-to-thickness ratios failed by extensive plastification on {{the central part of the}} tube. With the increase of diameter-to-thickness ratio, the local buckling phenomena became more pronounced. The stiffeners in the steel tubes increased the load carrying capacity and improved the ductility of the specimens. The experimental results were compared with current design guidelines on thin-walled steel members in AISC-LRFD, AS 4100 and European Specification. It was found that the test results agreed well with the results based on AS 4100 design code...|$|R
40|$|This {{addendum}} provides revisions and {{addition to}} the May 2008 proposal (attached) on the Direct Strength Prediction of Cold-Formed Steel (CFS) Beam-Columns. This addendum provides a revised statement of work to provide a clear separation between Year 1 {{of the project and}} the out years. This addendum also includes a revised and updated Year 1 budget. 1. Background In {{addition to the}} background provided on the Direct Strength Method (DSM) in the 2008 proposal two additional new points worthy of mentioning have emerged: (1) Recently adopted DSM provisions for <b>inelastic</b> reserve in <b>bending</b> allow for beams to have reliably predicted DSM strength in bending greater than My, where appropriate. This opens up additional space in the strength of beam-columns that the new provisions should explore taking advantage of under any loading condition. (2) The new CFS-NEES project (same PI as this project, see www. ce. jhu. edu/cfsnees) is developing a frame element appropriate for analysis of CFS. This element should incorporate the findings of this research and vastly increases the potential impact of the work – not only will code provisions result, but a new element {{that can be used in}} (frame) analysis. 2. Statement of Work The objective of the research remains the same as in the 2008 proposal, but is worth restating: Objective: The development and verification of a design method for beam-columns that explicitly and directly considers the applied actions, including axial loads and biaxial bending, in uniquely determining the stability and strength of a member under those actions.

Experimental and theoretical investigations show a high energy dissipation capacity that {{is due to the}} <b>inelastic</b> <b>bending</b> action of the pin. The susceptibility to brittle fracture or low-cycle fatigue is low as inelastic action takes place away from welds or stress concentrations. Design rules for the connections are developed.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study of elastoplastic deformation of titanium alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V subjected to four point bending prior to residual elastic strain measurements by high energy synchrotron diffraction. Both white-beam and monochromatic x-rays were used at the SRS Station 16. 3 in order to record diffraction patterns as a function of beam position across the sample. This allowed the comparison between the two techniques to be readily made. Residual (elastic) strain was calculated as a function of position across the sample, based on different reflections of hcp titanium. <b>Inelastic</b> <b>bending</b> analysis was used to extract the plastic strains. The results demonstrate that (i) the level of plastic deformation can be deduced from the x-ray diffraction profile, (ii) the asymmetry of the material response to plastic deformation in tension and compression can be identified and (iii) differences in the behaviour of different grain groups can be seen. © 2005 IOP Publishing Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the last}} few decades, energy {{absorption}} of materials becomes an critical issue in a design process of a vehicle because risks of primary and secondary accidents against pedestrians, other road users and structures can be reduced by a performance of absorbing energy in its support structures. Among various materials used for the structures, TRIP steel with favorable mechanical properties such as excellent formability and higher impact energy absorption is attractive to automotive industries. Huge numbers of research works {{have been carried out}} to investigate deformation behavior of TRIP steel. However, just few studies {{can be found on the}} performance in TRIP steel, especially, at higher deformation rate during the crash of the vehicle. Kinetic energy by higher speed of the vehicle will be consumed by <b>inelastic</b> <b>bending</b> deformation of components. Thus, a consideration of bending deformation at high impact velocity is required for the evaluation of the performance. In this study, the performance in TRIP steel at high deformation rate is clarified by conducting both quasi-static and impact three-point bending tests for pre-cracked specimen...|$|E
40|$|High ductile {{composite}} frame structures {{can represent}} a competitive solution in seismic-prone areas {{if they are}} endowed with efficient structural solutions. In detail, the introduction of dissipative partial-strength beam-to-column composite joints {{can lead to the}} formation of global mechanisms characterized by large inelastic rotations and therefore great amounts of dissipated energy. Monotonic and cyclic tests were conducted on subassemblies at the University of Pisa. The inelastic response of joints was divided mainly between shear yielding of the column web panel and <b>inelastic</b> <b>bending</b> of the extended end plate and column flange. Also yielding of the rebars and concrete crushing of the slab against the column flange took place. In order to guarantee a ductile behavior of partial-strength beam-to-column composite joints, it is needed a suitable capacity design of joint's mechanical components. Nonetheless, mechanical models of composite joints under seismic actions are not fully defined yet and many doubts still exist mainly with regard to strut and tie mechanisms in the reinforced concrete slab governing the force transfer between beam and column. In the paper, mechanical models of interior and exterior beam-to-column joints are presented on the basis of experimental results obtained in monotonic tests, through the analysis and modeling of each component part governing their structural behavior. A preliminary validation of the models is presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|The LiteSteel Beam (LSB) {{is a new}} cold-formed hollow flange {{channel section}} {{developed}} by OneSteel Australian Tube Mills using their patented dual electric resistance welding and automated continuous roll-forming process. It has a unique geometry consisting of torsionally rigid rectangular hollow flanges and a relatively slender web. In addition to this unique geometry, the LSB sections also have unique characteristics relating to their stress-strain curves, residual stresses, initial geometric imperfections and hollow flanges that are not encountered in conventional hot-rolled and cold-formed steel channel sections. An experimental study including 20 section moment capacity tests was therefore conducted to investigate the behaviour and strength of LSB flexural members. The presence of inelastic reserve bending capacity in these beams was investigated in detail although the current design rules generally limit the section moment capacities of cold-formed steel members to their first yield moments. The ultimate moment capacities from the tests were compared with the section moment capacities predicted by the current cold-formed and hot-rolled steel design standards.

40|$|A global {{study of}} trench flexure was {{performed}} by simultaneously modeling 117 bathymetric profiles (original depth soundings) and satellite-derived gravity profiles. A thin, elastic plate flexure model was fit to each bathymetry/gravity profile by minimization of the L(sub 1) norm. The six model parameters were regional depth, regional gravity, trench axis location, flexural wavelength, flexural amplitude, and lithospheric density. A regional tilt parameter was not required after correcting for age-related trend using a new high-resolution age map. Estimates of the density parameter confirm that most outer rises are uncompensated. We find that flexural wavelength is not an accurate estimate of plate thickness {{because of the high}} curvatures observed at a majority of trenches. As in previous studies, we find that the gravity data favor a longer-wavelength flexure than the bathymetry data. A joint topography-gravity modeling scheme and fit criteria are used to limit acceptable parameter values to models for which topography and gravity yield consistent results. Even after the elastic thicknesses are converted to mechanical thicknesses using the yield strength envelope model, residual scatter obscures the systematic increase of mechanical thickness with age; perhaps this reflects the combination of uncertainties inherent in estimating flexural wavelength, such as extreme <b>inelastic</b> <b>bending</b> and accumulated thermoelastic stress. The bending moment needed to support the trench and outer rise topography increases by a factor of 10 as lithospheric age increases from 20 to 150 Ma; this reflects the increase in saturation bending moment that the lithosphere can maintain. Using a stiff, dry-olivine rheology, we find that the lithosphere of the GDH 1 thermal model (Stein and Stein, 1992) is too hot and thin to maintain the observed bending moments. Moreover, the regional depth seaward of the oldest trenches (approximately 150 Ma) exceeds the GDH 1 model depths by about 400 m...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{behaviour}} of cold-formed channel sections with edge stiffener under pure bending. The primary {{aim of this}} research is to examine the <b>inelastic</b> <b>bending</b> capacity of cold-formed channel sections and in doing so provide design rules to account for such behaviour. Design rules are prepared for cold-formed steel specifications (inelastic reserve capacity) NASPEC (2007) and AS/NZS 4600 (2005) as well as hot-rolled steel specifications (compact, non-compact and slender classes) AS 4100 (1998). To investigate the behaviour of cold-formed channel sections under pure bending, this study conducts an extensive experimental and numerical analysis of 42 cold-formed channel sections in three different geometrical categories (simple channel sections, channel sections with simple edge stiffener and channel sections with complex edge stiffener) to determine the effect of different edge stiffeners on the ultimate strength of cold-formed channel sections. The sections are made from cold-formed G 450 steel with nominal thickness of 1. 6 mm and varying theoretical buckling stresses ranging between elastic to seven times the yield stress. The ultimate bending moment capacities of the sections are calculated from six methods being the: test result (), NASPEC (2007) design rules (), AS/NZS 4600 (2005) design rules (), DSM (), EUROCODE 3 (2006) design rules () and AS 4100 (1998) design rules (). The is then used as a benchmark to gauge the accuracy of the,,, and. The results of the test investigations showed that the existing design rules in NASPEC (2007), AS/NZS 4600 (2005), DSM and EUROCODE 3 (2006) are conservative and the sections classifications in AS 4100 (1998) are inaccurate for cold-formed channel sections. Therefore, the experimental results were used to revise the existing design methods (NASPEC (2007), AS/NZS 4600 (2005) and DSM) for determining the ultimate capacity of cold-formed channel sections in bending and also defining new slenderness limits for sections classifications in AS 4100 (1998). The yield line mechanism model is proposed and compared with the test results in order to investigate the behaviour of cold-formed channels with edge stiffener after collapse. Numerical (finite element) analyses is then developed and verified with the test results and used to investigate deformation process of cold-formed channel sections under bending that could not be monitored during the experimental program to complement the test results. The outcome {{of this study is to}} determine the section geometry for which a cold-formed channel section can reach the fully plastic capacity and maintain it for sufficient rotation, such that when employed in a structure such as a portal frame it may be considered applicable for plastic mechanism analysis, thus allowing for increased design capacities and more economical structural solutions...|$|E
40|$|The LiteSteel Beam (LSB) {{is a new}} hollow flange {{channel section}} {{developed}} by OneSteel Australian Tube Mills using a patented Dual Electric Resistance Welding technique. The LSB has a unique geometry consisting of torsionally rigid rectangular hollow flanges and a relatively slender web. It is commonly used as rafters, floor joists and bearers and roof beams in residential, industrial and commercial buildings. It is on average 40 % lighter than traditional hot-rolled steel beams of equivalent performance. The LSB flexural members are subjected to a relatively new Lateral Distortional Buckling mode, which reduces the member moment capacity. Unlike the commonly observed lateral torsional buckling of steel beams, lateral distortional buckling of LSBs is characterised by simultaneous lateral deflection, twist and web distortion. Current member moment capacity design rules for lateral distortional buckling in AS/NZS 4600 (SA, 2005) {{do not include the}} effect of section geometry of hollow flange beams although its effect is considered to be important. Therefore detailed experimental and finite element analyses (FEA) were carried out to investigate the lateral distortional buckling behaviour of LSBs including the effect of section geometry. The results showed that the current design rules in AS/NZS 4600 (SA, 2005) are over-conservative in the inelastic lateral buckling region. New improved design rules were therefore developed for LSBs based on both FEA and experimental results. A geometrical parameter (K) defined as the ratio of the flange torsional rigidity to the major axis flexural rigidity of the web (GJf/EIxweb) was identified as the critical parameter affecting the lateral distortional buckling of hollow flange beams. The effect of section geometry was then included in the new design rules using the new parameter (K). The new design rule developed by including this parameter was found to be accurate in calculating the member moment capacities of not only LSBs, but also other types of hollow flange steel beams such as Hollow Flange Beams (HFBs), Monosymmetric Hollow Flange Beams (MHFBs) and Rectangular Hollow Flange Beams (RHFBs). The inelastic reserve bending capacity of LSBs has not been investigated yet although the section moment capacity tests of LSBs in the past revealed that inelastic reserve bending capacity is present in LSBs. However, the Australian and American cold-formed steel design codes limit them to the first yield moment. Therefore both experimental and FEA were carried out to investigate the section moment capacity behaviour of LSBs. A comparison of the section moment capacity results from FEA, experiments and current cold-formed steel design codes showed that compact and non-compact LSB sections classified based on AS 4100 (SA, 1998) have some inelastic reserve capacity while slender LSBs do not have any inelastic reserve capacity beyond their first yield moment. It was found that Shifferaw and Schafer’s (2008) proposed equations and Eurocode 3 Part 1. 3 (ECS, 2006) design equations can be used to include the <b>inelastic</b> <b>bending</b> capacities of compact and non-compact LSBs in design. As a simple design approach, the section moment capacity of compact LSB sections can be taken as 1. 10 times their first yield moment while it is the first yield moment for non-compact sections. For slender LSB sections, current cold-formed steel codes can be used to predict their section moment capacities. It was believed that the use of transverse web stiffeners could improve the lateral distortional buckling moment capacities of LSBs. However, currently there are no design equations to predict the elastic lateral distortional buckling and member moment capacities of LSBs with web stiffeners under uniform moment conditions. Therefore, a detailed study was conducted using FEA to simulate both experimental and ideal conditions of LSB flexural members. It was shown that the use of 3 to 5 mm steel plate stiffeners welded or screwed to the inner faces of the top and bottom flanges of LSBs at third span points and supports provided an optimum web stiffener arrangement. Suitable design rules were developed to calculate the improved elastic buckling and ultimate moment capacities of LSBs with these optimum web stiffeners. A design rule using the geometrical parameter K was also developed to improve the accuracy of ultimate moment capacity predictions. This thesis presents the details and results of the experimental and numerical studies of the section and member moment capacities of LSBs conducted in this research. It includes the recommendations made regarding the accuracy of current design rules as well as the new design rules for lateral distortional buckling. The new design rules include the effects of section geometry of hollow flange steel beams. This thesis also developed a method of using web stiffeners to reduce the lateral distortional buckling effects, and associated design rules to calculate the improved moment capacities...|$|E
