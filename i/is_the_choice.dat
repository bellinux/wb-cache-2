25|$|Deity worship (Bhakti), visiting {{temples and}} Puja rites are not {{mandatory}} and is optional in Hinduism; it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> of a Hindu, {{it may be}} a routine daily affair for some Hindus, periodic ritual or infrequent for some. Worship practices in Hinduism are as diverse as its traditions, and a Hindu can choose to be polytheistic, pantheistic, monotheistic, monistic, agnostic, atheistic, or humanist.|$|E
25|$|Nazarenes permit both believer's baptism {{and infant}} baptism. When {{a family in}} the Church of the Nazarene chooses not to baptize their infants they often {{participate}} in an infant dedication. Whether a child is baptized or dedicated <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> of {{the parents of the}} child. This decision is often based on geographic location, local church culture, and their pastor's theological leanings, and if they were baptized or dedicated as a child.|$|E

25|$|Partly due also to {{the variety}} of climates in Japan and the {{millennium}} encompassed between the first cultural import and the last, the result is extremely heterogeneous, but several practically universal features can nonetheless be found. First of all <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> of materials, always wood in various forms (planks, straw, tree bark, etc.) for almost all structures. Unlike both Western and some Chinese architecture, the use of stone is avoided except for certain specific uses, for example temple podia and pagoda foundations.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} decisions regarding the design of a digital radio system <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> of which audio codec to use, because the efficiency of the audio codec determines how many radio stations can be carried on a multiplex at a given level of audio quality. The capacity of a DAB multiplex is fixed, so the more efficient the audio codec is, the more stations can be carried, and vice versa. Similarly, for a fixed bit-rate level, the more efficient the audio codec is the higher the audio quality will be.|$|E
25|$|Another {{consideration}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> of promoter. The SV40 promoter was conventionally used until research {{showed that}} vectors {{driven by the}} Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV) promoter had much higher expression rates. More recently, expression rates have been further increased {{by the use of}} the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate early promoter. Inclusion of the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPV)-CTE with/without rev increased envelope expression. Furthermore, the CTE+rev construct was significantly more immunogenic than CTE-alone vector. Additional modifications to improve expression rates include the insertion of enhancer sequences, synthetic introns, adenovirus tripartite leader (TPL) sequences and modifications to the polyadenylation and transcriptional termination sequences. An example of DNA vaccine plasmid is pVAC, which uses SV40 promoter.|$|E

25|$|Long {{stirrups}} {{allow the}} rider {{to ride with}} a long leg, with the knee relaxed and only slightly bent, allowing a deep and stable seat in the saddle. When riding a long stirrup, the rider has excellent control of the horse and the greatest ability to feel and communicate with the horse via the riding aids. This provides a sturdy base for activities where precision is required or when the rider is {{at risk of being}} unseated. For both reasons, long stirrups were thus the choice of heavy cavalry such as the medieval knights, who fought in close quarters and used weapons such as the lance and long, heavy swords. Historically, this type of stirrup adjustment and the riding seat it produced was called la brida. Today it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> for dressage and many types of western riders.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} tactical decision <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> of shot types. Round shot is {{the default}} shot type, with upgrades providing grape shot and chain shot. Each type causes {{a different type}} of damage, and also has different ballistic capabilities. Round shot has the longest range of the three, and greatest speed. Upon impact, it has a great chance of damaging a ship's hull (potentially sinking the ship), and a smaller chance of destroying cannon, killing crew, or damaging the sails. Chain shot has a shorter range and flies at a slower speed in a high trajectory. Its impact is most likely to cause sail damage to the enemy ship, slowing it down or potentially dismasting it. Chain shot also has a small chance of killing enemy crew. Grape shot is very slow and has a short range, but upon impact it can kill large portions of the enemy crew, weakening the ship and slowing its reloading. Grape shot also has the potential of damaging enemy sails.|$|E
25|$|The {{restraint}} koinophilia exerts on {{phenotypic change}} suggests that evolution can only occur if mutant mates cannot be avoided {{as a result}} of a severe scarcity of potential mates. This is most likely to occur in small restricted communities, such as on small islands, in remote valleys, lakes, river systems, caves, or during periods of glaciation, or following mass extinctions, when sudden bursts of evolution can be expected. Under these circumstances, not only <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> of mates severely restricted, but population bottlenecks, founder effects, genetic drift and inbreeding cause rapid, random changes in the isolated population's genetic composition. Furthermore, hybridization with a related species trapped in the same isolate might introduce additional genetic changes. If an isolated population such as this survives its genetic upheavals, and subsequently expands into an unoccupied niche, or into a niche in which it has an advantage over its competitors, a new species, or subspecies, will have come in being. In geological terms this will be an abrupt event. A resumption of avoiding mutant mates will, thereafter, result, once again, in evolutionary stagnation.|$|E

25|$|In {{electron}} beam lithography (EBL), an electron-sensitive resist is exposed to a beam of high-energy electrons. There <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> of a positive or negative type resist; however, lower feature resolution can be obtained with negative resists. Patterns are created by programming the beam of electrons for the exact path to follow along {{the surface of the}} material. Resolution is affected by other factors such as electron scattering in the resist and backscattering from the substrate. EBL can create single surface features on the order of 3–5nm. If multiple features are required over a large surface area, {{as is the case in}} tissue engineering, the resolution drops and features can only be created as small as 30–40nm, and the resist development begins to weigh more heavily on pattern formation. To prevent dissolution of the resist, ultrasonic agitation can be used to overcome intermolecular forces. In addition, isopropyl alcohol (IPA) helps develop high-density arrays. EBL can become a quicker and less costly process by replicating nanometer patters in polymeric materials; the replication process has been demonstrated with polycaprolactone (PCL) using hot embossing and solvent casting. In a study conducted by Gomez et al. (2007), microchannels 1 and 2µm wide and 400 and 800nm deep created by EBL on PDMS were shown to enhance axon formation of hippocampal cells in culture more so than immobilized chemical cues.|$|E

500|$|For Kuhn, {{the choice}} of {{paradigm}} was sustained by rational processes, but not ultimately determined by them. The choice between paradigms involves setting two or more [...] "portraits" [...] against the world and deciding which likeness is most promising. For Kuhn, acceptance or rejection of a paradigm is a social process {{as much as a}} logical process. Kuhn's position, however, is not one of relativism. According to Kuhn, a paradigm shift occurs when a significant number of observational anomalies arise in the old paradigm and a new paradigm makes sense of them. That <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> of a new paradigm is based on observations, even though those observations are made against the background of the old paradigm.|$|E

500|$|The bosses still {{hoped to}} deny McKinley a first-ballot {{majority}} {{at the convention}} by boosting support for local favorite son candidates such as Quay, New York Governor (and former vice president) Levi P. Morton, and Illinois Senator Shelby Cullom. Delegate-rich Illinois proved a crucial battleground, as McKinley supporters, such as Chicago businessman (and future vice president) Charles G. Dawes, sought to elect delegates pledged to vote for McKinley at the national convention in St. Louis. Cullom proved unable to stand against McKinley despite the support of local Republican machines; at the state convention {{at the end of}} April, McKinley completed a near-sweep of Illinois' delegates. Former president Harrison had been deemed a possible contender if he entered the race; when Harrison made it known he would not seek a third nomination, the McKinley organization took control of Indiana with a speed Harrison privately found unseemly. Morton operatives who journeyed to Indiana sent word back that they had found the state alive for McKinley. Wyoming Senator Francis Warren wrote, [...] "The politicians are making a hard fight against him, but if the masses could speak, McKinley <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> of at least 75% of the entire [...] Republican voters in the Union".|$|E
500|$|Along with Knocked Up and Waitress, {{two other}} 2007 films about women facing {{unplanned}} pregnancies, Juno was interpreted by some critics {{as having a}} pro-life theme. Ann Hulbert of Slate magazine believed that Juno [...] " [...] both pro-life and pro-choice purism." [...] Jeff Dawson of The Sunday Times believed that the film was inevitably placed in the [...] "unwanted pregnancy subgenre" [...] with Knocked Up and Waitress due to its subject matter but thought that its interpretation as a pro-life film only [...] "muddied the waters". Hadley Freeman of The Guardian criticized Juno for [...] "complet a hat-trick of American comedies in the past 12 months that present abortion as unreasonable, or even unthinkable—a telling social sign", though she noted, [...] "I don't believe any of these films is consciously designed to be anti-abortion propaganda." [...] A. O. Scott, writing for The New York Times, agreed that Juno has [...] "an underlying theme, a message that is not anti-abortion but rather pro-adulthood." [...] Ellen Page commented, [...] "What I get most frustrated at is when people call it a pro-life movie, which is just absurd... The most important thing <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> is there, and the film completely demonstrates that." [...] Cody and Page have openly stated that they are pro-choice; Reitman {{thought that it was}} [...] "fantastic" [...] that pro-life and pro-choice groups were embracing the film. He said that [...] "Juno seems to be a mirror, and people [...] see themselves in it." ...|$|E

2500|$|An [...] (1064nm wavelength) is {{a common}} choice of laser for working with {{biological}} specimens. This is because such specimens (being mostly water) have a low absorption coefficient at this wavelength. A low absorption is advisable so as to minimise damage to the biological material, {{sometimes referred to as}} opticution. Perhaps the most important consideration in optical tweezer design <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> of the objective. A stable trap requires that the gradient force, which is dependent upon the numerical aperture (NA) of the objective, be greater than the scattering force. Suitable objectives typically have an NA between 1.2 and 1.4.|$|E
2500|$|When {{working in}} polar {{coordinates}} {{it is not}} necessary to convert to Cartesian coordinates to use line integration, since the line integral between consecutive vertices (ri,θi) and (r'i+1,θi+1) of a polygon is given directly by [...] This is valid for all values of θ, with some decrease in numerical accuracy when |θ| is many orders of magnitude greater than π. With this formulation negative area indicates clockwise traversal, which should be kept in mind when mixing polar and cartesian coordinates.

2500|$|Already in 1787, James Wilson, like Adams a US Founding Father, {{understood}} {{the importance of}} multiple-member districts: [...] "Bad elections proceed from the smallness of the districts which give an opportunity to bad men to intrigue themselves into office", and again, in 1791, in his Lectures on Law: [...] "It may, I believe, be assumed as a general maxim, of no small importance in democratical governments, that the more extensive the district of election <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>choice</b> will be the more wise and enlightened". [...] The 1790 Constitution of Pennsylvania specified multiple-member districts for the state Senate and required their boundaries to follow county lines.|$|E
