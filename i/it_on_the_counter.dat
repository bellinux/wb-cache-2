60|$|Mr. Engel {{picked up}} one of the books as <b>it</b> lay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> and as he read the title his face betrayed a slight surprise.|$|R
60|$|I {{showed her}} the little piece of calico that my wife had given me. She {{looked at it and}} handed it back to me. Then she took down a great roll of red calico and spread <b>it</b> out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, that's what he's a buying o'--haw, haw!' {{said one}} of the young men, as the shopman removed from the window a {{gorgeous}} blue velvet tray of wedding-rings, and laid <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mr. George {{brought up}} his valise, and placed <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter.</b> A custom house officer, {{who had just}} {{examined}} and marked some other parcels, turned to Mr. George's {{just as he had}} unlocked and opened it.|$|E
60|$|The girl, {{who knew}} her customer, served him without a murmur, deftly {{avoiding}} the gaze of ungenerous triumph with which the injured captain favoured her as he raised the cooling beverage to his lips. The glass emptied, he placed <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> and sighed despondently.|$|E
50|$|The President {{appointed}} herself chief swamper {{and could}} be seen for days on end, attired in slacks and gumboots, shoveling snow from the sidewalk so the customers could be in. When the thaw came she made it her job to mop up the floor and wring out the merchandise, as the roof leaked in a multitude of places. One member had a station wagon {{and it was her}} duty to pick up the rummage. When a load provided too big for the station wagon, she borrowed the ambulance that was used to transport patients from Allco to Marpole. For lack of storage space, the rummage was kept in members' cars until there was room for <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counters.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{went to the}} bar, {{laid his}} card <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> bought a drink of absinthe, and then drawing from his pocket a little mirror, set <b>it</b> up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> and {{proceeded}} to don a false beard and hair and paint his face into wrinkles, until he closely resembled an old man seventy-one years of age.|$|R
60|$|After that, {{every one}} {{knew that the}} license {{question}} was practically settled. The petition {{was all over the}} town. It was printed in duplicate at the Newspacket and you could see <b>it</b> lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> of every shop in Mariposa. Some of the people signed it twenty or thirty times.|$|R

[...] He drank off the spirits in his tumbler, rapped with <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> and announced, [...] "The gentleman in the corner is going to rehearse the Articles of his Belief, in the Latin tongue, for the edification of the company." ...|$|E
6000|$|So axepting Lord Yardham's cortasy, he {{returned}} it by ordering {{another glass of}} gin at his own expence, and they both drank <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> where Jools talked of the affaers of Europ all night. To everything he said, the Earl of Yardham answered, [...] "Wee, wee;" [...] except {{at the end of}} the evening, when he squeeged his & and said, [...] "Bong swore." ...|$|E
60|$|He passed more Golden Balls {{than all}} the jugglers in Europe have juggled with, {{in the course of}} their united performances, before he could {{determine}} in favour of any particular shop where those symbols were displayed. In the end he came back to one of the first he had seen, and entering by a side-door in a court, where the three balls, with the legend 'Money Lent,' were repeated in a ghastly transparency, passed into one of a series of little closets, or private boxes, erected for the accommodation of the more bashful and uninitiated customers. He bolted himself in; pulled out his watch; and laid <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Jees Uck," [...] he said, [...] "take a candle. Go {{into the}} kitchen.

60|$|She went away, after saying this, but {{stopping}} in at a dry goods store to shop, she forgot the precious box {{in her new}} interest and left <b>it</b> lying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ribbon <b>counter.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Meanwhile two new {{customers}} entered, and the repeated call, [...] "Addy!" [...] {{brought from the}} back of the shop a group that Deronda turned frankly to stare at, feeling sure that the stare would be held complimentary. The group consisted of a black-eyed young woman who carried a black-eyed little one, its head already covered with black curls, and deposited <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> from which station it looked round with even more than the usual intelligence of babies: also a robust boy of six and a younger girl, both with black eyes and black-ringed hair--looking more Semitic than their parents, as the puppy lions show the spots of far-off progenitors. The young woman answering to [...] "Addy"--a sort of paroquet in a bright blue dress, with coral necklace and earrings, her hair set up in a huge bush--looked as complacently lively and unrefined as her husband; and by a certain difference from the mother deepened in Deronda the unwelcome impression that the latter was not so utterly common a Jewess as to exclude her being the mother of Mirah. While that thought was glancing through his mind, the boy had run forward into the shop with an energetic stamp, and setting himself about four feet from Deronda, with his hands in the pockets of his miniature knickerbockers, looked at him with a precocious air of survey. Perhaps it was chiefly with a diplomatic design to linger and ingratiate himself that Deronda patted the boy's head, saying-- ...|$|E
60|$|Yes, I made various acquaintances in {{the hamlet}} and {{a thing that}} gratified me a good deal was to find our new coins in {{circulation}} --lots of milrays, lots of mills, lots of cents, a good many nickels, and some silver; all this among the artisans and commonalty generally; yes, and even some gold--but {{that was at the}} bank, that is to say, the goldsmith's. I dropped in there while Marco, the son of Marco, was haggling with a shopkeeper over a quarter of a pound of salt, and asked for change for a twenty-dollar gold piece. They furnished it--that is, after they had chewed the piece, and rung <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> and tried acid on it, and asked me where I got it, and who I was, and where I was from, and where I was going to, and when I expected to get there, and perhaps a couple of hundred more questions; and when they got aground, I went right on and furnished them a lot of information voluntarily; told them I owned a dog, and his name was Watch, and my first wife was a Free Will Baptist, and her grandfather was a Prohibitionist, and I used to know a man who had two thumbs on each hand and a wart on the inside of his upper lip, and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection, and so on, and so on, and so on, till even that hungry village questioner began to look satisfied, and also a shade put out; but he had to respect a man of my financial strength, and so he didn't give me any lip, but I noticed he took it out of his underlings, which was a perfectly natural thing to do. Yes, they changed my twenty, but I judged it strained the bank a little, which was a thing to be expected, for it was the same as walking into a paltry village store in the nineteenth century and requiring the boss of it to change a two thousand-dollar bill for you all of a sudden. He could do it, maybe; {{but at the same time}} he would wonder how a small farmer happened to be carrying so much money around in his pocket; which was probably this goldsmith's thought, too; for he followed me to the door and stood there gazing after me with reverent admiration.|$|E

Harley appears and notes her change in appearance -- the flowers are actually from him. Harley claims {{he is willing to}} do anything to be near her. At home, Judith leaves a cupcake with a candle in <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter.</b> Realizing his mistake, Brice dances and sings in a cowboy outfit for her. The two make up.|$|E

60|$|Weston {{started a}} little {{when he reached the}} last suggestion, for he fancied that it was Miss Stirling who had made <b>it.</b> He leaned <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> for several minutes, {{thinking}} hard; and then, though he was not sure that he acted wisely, he started for the station to despatch a telegram, as Stirling had directed.

40|$|A {{complete}} {{overview of}} library activity implies {{a complete and}} reliable measurement {{of the use of}} both electronic resources and printed materials. This measurement is based on three sets of definitions: document types, use types and user types. There is a common model of definitions for printed materials, but a lot of questions and technical issues remain for electronic resources. In 2006 a French national working group studied these questions. <b>It</b> relied <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>COUNTER</b> standard, but found it insufficient and pointed out the need for local tools such as web markers and deep analysis of proxy logs. Within the French national consortium COUPERIN, a new working group is testing ERMS, SUSHI standards, Shibboleth authentication, along with COUNTER standards, to improve the counting of the electronic resources use. At this stage this counting is insufficient and its improvement will be a European challenge for the future...|$|R
5000|$|Later, Cola finds Berner outside {{waiting in}} case Mia arrives. She then sarcastically {{suggests}} Berner [...] "clean his pipes" [...] {{to help him}} relax. Inside, Evan plays a card game similar to Magic: The Gathering with his friend X-Ray. As Cola leaves to prepare for her meeting with Peter Whales, Berner grabs an issue of a comic called Zombie Gal and heads to the basement. There he has a fantasy of the title character coming to life and seducing him while a zombie awkwardly watches. Cola returns in a sexy red dress {{at the same time}} Berner returns from the basement. She grabs the comic from his hand and throws <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> as she pulls him to go with her to meet Peter. They find Peter Whales in a small hotel room but before they can ask about the signing, he tears into them and begins deconstructing Cola's life. He accuses her of running from something. This causes Cola to think of how she ran from Danny, which prompts her to call him and ask to meet up.|$|E
5000|$|This {{document}} {{helps to}} establish the need the CIA had for assistance {{in the form of}} money and weaponry to aid the contras in their fight against the Sandinistas. Especially after congress outlawed funding by America for the contra/Sandinista fighting (through the various bills and legislation enacted by congress). In November 1984, retired CIA agent Ted Shackley met with a notorious Iranian swindler named Manucher Ghorbanifar, whom the CIA had identified as [...] "an intelligence fabricator and a nuisance." [...] Tim Weiner writes in Legacy of Ashes: Shackley listened with interest as Ghorbanifar discussed ways to free the American hostages. Perhaps it could be a secret ransom, a straight cash deal. Or perhaps it could be profitable. the United States could ship missiles to Iran, using a trading firm...The sale of weapons would create goodwill in Tehran, millions for the private traders involved, and a large cash ransom to free BIll Buckley and his fellow American hostages. Shackley reported the conversation to the ubiquitous Vernon Walters, who passed <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> terrorism czar Robert Oakley.In 1985, William Casey made the decision {{to go ahead with the}} sale of American weapons to Iran, and use the money to fund the contras, all outside the government's knowledge.|$|E
40|$|This study {{attempted}} {{to decrease the}} amount of days that the participant went without washing her dishes. The participant would let her dishes pile up for days leading to unsanitary situations. For example, the participant would not soak her {{dishes in the sink}} when she was done eating or cooking she would simply just set <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter.</b> This would lead to whatever leftover food that was left on the plate to be caked on and take a long amount of time to wash off. Therefore, the study used ABAC design to help {{to reduce the number of}} days that the participant would let her dishes pile up for. After observing the behavior of the participant and realizing that this was a behavior that needed to be changed, the researcher made the behavior apparent to the participant and she volunteered herself for the study. Through the use of two different interventions, in an attempt to reach the goal of only having the duration of one day of letting her dishes pile up. The two different interventions included a stimulus intervention, which included having pictures of what her kitchen looked like when it was clean up on the cupboards. The second intervention included the pictures as well as verbal prompting to ensure that the behavior was to be performed. The outcome of the study showed that the participant was able to reduce the duration of the amount of days between washing dishes...|$|E
60|$|The cat, {{with its}} fore-paws tucked beneath <b>it,</b> was dozing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter.</b> Business had been slack that morning, {{and it had}} only been pushed off three times. It had staked out a claim on that counter some five years before, and if {{anything}} was required to convince it {{of the value of}} the possession it was the fact that it was being constantly pushed off. To a firm-minded cat this alone gave <b>the</b> <b>counter</b> a value difficult to overestimate, and sometimes an obsequious customer fell into raptures over its beauty. This was soothing, and the animal allowed customers of this type to scratch it gently behind the ear.|$|R

At that moment, to an impartial observer, Mr Verloc would have appeared more than human in his magnanimity. He took down a small cardboard box from a shelf, peeped in to see that the contents were all right, and put <b>it</b> down gently <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter.</b> Not till that was done did he break the silence, to the effect that most likely Stevie would profit greatly by being sent out of town for a while; only he supposed his wife could not get on without him.|$|R

40|$|Distributed key {{generation}} (DKG) {{has been studied}} extensively in the cryptographic literature. However, {{it has never been}} examined outside of the synchronous setting, and the known DKG protocols cannot guarantee safety or liveness over the Internet. In this work, we present the first realistic DKG protocol for use over the Internet. We propose a practical system model for the Internet and define an efficient verifiable secret sharing (VSS) scheme in it. We observe the necessity of Byzantine agreement for asynchronous DKG and analyze the difficulty of using a randomized protocol for it. Using our VSS scheme and a leader-based agreement protocol, we then design a provably secure DKG protocol. We also consider and achieve cryptographic properties such as uniform randomness of the shared secret and compare static versus adaptive adversary models. Finally, we implement our DKG protocol, and establish its efficiency and reliability by extensively testing <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> PlanetLab platform. <b>Counter</b> to a general non-scalability perception about asynchronous systems, our experiments demonstrate that our asynchronous DKG protocol scales well with the system size and it is suitable for realizing multiparty computation and threshold cryptography over the Internet...|$|R
6000|$|... 'ATHENAEUM TERRACE. [...] ST. MILDRED'S, [...] Sept. 6th. 'MY DEAR PHILIP,--No one {{can have}} a greater dislike than myself to what is called mischief-making; {{therefore}} I leave it entirely to you to make what use you please of the following facts, which have fallen under my notice. Sir Guy Morville has been several times at St. Mildred's, in company with Tom Harewood, and more than once alone with some strange questionable-looking people; and not many days ago, my maid met him {{coming out of a}} house in one of the low streets, which it is hard to assign a motive for his visiting. This, however, might be accident, and I should never have thought of mentioning it, but for a circumstance that occurred this morning. I had occasion to visit Grey's Bank, and while waiting in conversation with Mr. Grey, a person came in whom I knew to be a notorious gambler, and offered a cheque to be changed. As <b>it</b> lay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>counter,</b> my eye was caught by the signature. It was my uncle's. I looked again, and could not be mistaken. It was a draft for £30 <b>on</b> Drummond, dated <b>the</b> 12th of August, to Sir Guy Morville, signed C. Edmonstone, and endorsed in Sir Guy's own writing, with the name of John White. In order that I might be certain that I was doing the poor young man no injustice, I outstayed the man, and asked who he was, when Mr. Grey confirmed me in my belief that it was one Jack White, a jockeying sort of man who attends all the races in the country, and makes his livelihood by betting and gambling. And now, my dear brother, make what use of this fact you think fit, though I fear there is little hope of rescuing the poor youth from the fatal habits which are hereditary in his family, and must be strong indeed not to have been eradicated by such careful training as you say he has received. I leave it entirely to you, trusting in your excellent judgment, and only hoping you will not bring my name forward. Grieving much at having {{to be the first to}} communicate such unpleasant tidings, which will occasion so much vexation at Hollywell.' ...|$|R
