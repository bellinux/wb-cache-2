25|$|In its {{simplest}} (and {{most commonly}} used) form, the railgun differs {{from a traditional}} electric motor in that no use is made of additional field windings (or permanent magnets). This basic configuration is formed by a single loop of current and thus requires high currents (e.g., of order one million amperes) to produce sufficient accelerations (and muzzle velocities). A relatively common variant of this configuration is the augmented railgun in which the <b>driving</b> <b>current</b> is channelled through additional pairs of parallel conductors, arranged to increase ("augment") the magnetic field experienced by the moving armature. These arrangements reduce the current required for a given acceleration. In electric motor terminology, augmented railguns are usually series-wound configurations.|$|E
2500|$|With most {{practical}} railgun geometries, {{it is not}} easy to produce an electromagnetic expression for the railgun force that is both simple and reasonably accurate.

2500|$|In {{radio and}} {{telecommunications}} a dipole antenna or doublet is {{the simplest and}} most widely used class of antenna. [...] The dipole is any one of a class of antennas producing a radiation pattern approximating that of an elementary electric dipole with a radiating structure supporting a line current so energized that the current has only one node at each end. [...] A dipole antenna commonly consists of two identical conductive elements such as metal wires or rods, which are usually bilaterally symmetrical. [...] The <b>driving</b> <b>current</b> from the transmitter is applied, or for receiving antennas the output signal to the receiver is taken, between {{the two halves of}} the antenna. [...] Each side of the feedline to the transmitter or receiver is connected to one of the conductors. [...] This contrasts with a monopole antenna, which consists of a single rod or conductor [...] with one side of the feedline connected to it, and the other side connected to some type of ground. [...] A common example of a dipole is the [...] "rabbit ears" [...] television antenna found on broadcast television sets.|$|E
2500|$|It is now {{understood}} that inductive and capacitive coupling are [...] "near-field" [...] effects, so they {{cannot be used}} for long-distance transmission. However, Tesla was obsessed with developing a long range wireless power transmission system which could transmit power from power plants directly into homes and factories without wires, described in a visionary June 1900 article in Century Magazine; [...] "The Problem of Increasing Human Energy". He claimed {{to be able to}} transmit power on a worldwide scale, using a method that involved conduction through the Earth and atmosphere. Tesla believed that the entire Earth could act as an electrical resonator, and that by <b>driving</b> <b>current</b> pulses into the Earth at its resonant frequency from a grounded Tesla coil with an elevated capacitance, the potential of the Earth could be made to oscillate, creating global standing waves, and this alternating current could be received with a capacitive antenna tuned to resonance with it at any point on Earth. Another of his ideas was that transmitting and receiving terminals could be suspended in the air by balloons at [...] altitude, where the air pressure is lower. At this altitude, he thought, a layer of electrically conductive rarefied air would allow electricity to be sent at high voltages (hundreds of millions of volts) over long distances. Tesla envisioned building a global network of wireless power stations, which he called his [...] "World Wireless System", which would transmit both information and electric power to everyone on Earth. [...] There is no reliable evidence that he ever transmitted significant amounts of power beyond the short range demonstrations above.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis study {{presents}} {{the influence of}} various substituents on the photophysical features of heteroleptic copper(I) complexes bearing both N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) and dipyridylamine (dpa = dipyridylamine skeleton corresponding to ligand L 1) ligands. The luminescent properties have been compared to our recently reported archetypal blue emitting [Cu(IPr) (dpa) ][PF 6] complex. The choice of the substituents on both ligands has been guided to explore {{the effect of the}} electron donor/acceptor and “push–pull” on the emission wavelengths and photoluminescence quantum yields. A selection of the best candidates in terms of their photophysical features were applied for developing the first blue light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) based on copper(I) complexes. The device analysis suggests that the main concern is the moderate redox stability of the complexes under high applied <b>driving</b> <b>currents,</b> leading to devices with moderate stabilities pointing to a proof-of-concept for further development. Nevertheless, under low applied <b>driving</b> <b>currents</b> the blue emission is stable, showing performance levels competitive to those reported for blue LECs based on iridium(III) complexes.

50|$|Due to {{the lower}} overall fields, an RFP reactor might not need superconducting magnets. This is a large {{advantage}} over tokamaks since superconducting magnets are delicate and expensive and so must be shielded from the Neutron rich fusion environment. RFPs are susceptible to surface instabilities and so require a close fitting shell. Some experiments (such as the Madison Symmetric Torus) use their close fitting shell as a magnetic coil by <b>driving</b> <b>current</b> through the shell itself. This is attractive from a reactor standpoint since a solid copper shell (for example) would be fairly robust against high energy neutrons, compared with superconducting magnets. There is also no established beta limit for RFPs. There exists a possibility that a reversed field pinch could achieve ignition solely with ohmic power (by <b>driving</b> <b>current</b> through the plasma and generating heat from electrical resistance, rather than through electron cyclotron resonance heating), which would be much simpler than tokamak designs, though {{it could not be}} operated in steady state.|$|E
50|$|Unlike the Tokamak, {{which has}} a much larger {{magnetic}} field in the toroidal direction than the poloidal direction, an RFP has a comparable field strength in both directions (though {{the sign of the}} toroidal field reverses).
