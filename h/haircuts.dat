5|$|In July 1986, Peterson {{offered a}} free flattop haircut {{to anyone who}} {{attended}} the opening of his third store at 82nd and Foster. Peterson, who got his first flattop haircut in 1952, hired three barbers to give <b>haircuts</b> {{on the floor of}} his showrooms. They gave about 50 <b>haircuts</b> the first day, and Peterson decided to make the gimmick a weekly event. He continued offering the <b>haircuts</b> for two decades and as of 2002 was still giving away about ten <b>haircuts</b> per week.|$|E

Each character has a smartphone for contacting friends, starting activities and accessing an in-game Internet. The Internet lets players trade in stocks via a stock market. Players may purchase properties such as garages and businesses, upgrade the weapons and vehicles in each character's arsenal, and customise their appearance by purchasing outfits, <b>haircuts</b> and tattoos.|$|E
5|$|Costume {{designer}} Christine Peters crafted the episode's baseball uniforms {{after visiting}} Sports Robe, a Hollywood costume house. Dena Green from the hair department gave extras <b>haircuts</b> {{so that they}} would be {{in the style of the}} 1940s. Car coordinator Kelly Padovich rented two 1947 model Flxible buses for the Roswell Greys on-bus scenes, as well as various other 1930s- and 1940s-era cars. Researcher Lee Smith worked with the Baseball Hall of Fame to ensure the accuracy of the statistics used in the episode. The props department developed from scratch the Peter Rosebud Bank that Dales shows Mulder; it was one of the most expensive props of the season. The score by Mark Snow, the show's composer, was recorded with musicians rather than synthesizers for the first time in the series' history; slide guitar player Nick Kirgo and harmonica performer Tommy Morgan assisted Snow with the music.|$|E

5|$|Some Muslims {{are also}} opposed to men having long hair {{as it is}} also {{important}} in Islam to have clear differences (in appearance) between sexes. And generally these cultures encourage women to have long hair and men to have short hair. The Taliban in Afghanistan viewed long hair for men as a western influence, and punished it by arrest and forced <b>haircuts,</b> although this would be a direct contradiction of the sunnah of the Prophet. Similar measures have been taken by Islamists in Iraq. In spite of this, several Taliban affiliated members of the Mehsud clan are recognisable by their long hair. The Saudi Islamist fighter Amir Khattab was also notable for his long hair. Dervishes of some Sufi orders, such as the Kasnazani, often have long hair and whirl it around during rituals.|$|E
5|$|The group {{increasingly}} {{focused on}} the suppression of sexual desire; Applewhite and seven others opted for surgical castration. They initially had difficulty finding a willing surgeon, but eventually found one in Mexico. In Applewhite's view, sexuality {{was one of the}} most powerful forces that bound humans to their bodies and thus hindered their efforts to evolve to the Next Level; he taught that Next Level beings had no reproductive organs but that Luciferian beings had genders. He also cited a verse in the New Testament that said there would not be marriage in heaven. In addition, he required members to adopt similar clothing and <b>haircuts,</b> possibly to reinforce that they were a non-sexual family.|$|E
5|$|Roman {{military}} withdrawals left Britain open to {{invasion by}} pagan, seafaring warriors from north-western continental Europe, chiefly the Saxons, Angles, Jutes and Frisians {{who had long}} raided the coasts of the Roman province and began to settle, initially {{in the eastern part}} of the country. Their advance was contained for some decades after the Britons' victory at the Battle of Mount Badon, but subsequently resumed, over-running the fertile lowlands of Britain and reducing the area under Brythonic control to a series of separate enclaves in the more rugged country to the west by the end of the 6th century. Contemporary texts describing this period are extremely scarce, giving rise to its description as a Dark Age. The nature and progression of the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain is consequently subject to considerable disagreement. Roman-dominated Christianity had in general disappeared from the conquered territories, but was reintroduced by missionaries from Rome led by Augustine from 597 onwards. Disputes between the Roman- and Celtic-dominated forms of Christianity ended in victory for the Roman tradition at the Council of Whitby (664), which was ostensibly about <b>haircuts</b> and the date of Easter, but more significantly, about the differences in Roman and Celtic forms of authority, theology, and practice (Lehane).|$|E

25|$|By 1981, {{short hair}} {{had made a}} {{comeback}} for men, {{in reaction to the}} shag and mod <b>haircuts</b> of the mid to late 70s. The sideburns of the 1960s and 1970s saw a massive decline in fashion, and many guys wore regular <b>haircuts</b> and quiffs. Beards went out of style due to their association with hippies, but moustaches remained common among blue collar men.|$|E

50|$|When used in {{the context}} of {{exchange}} traded products such as stocks, options, or futures, <b>haircut</b> is used interchangeably with the term margin.

25|$|The {{football}} casual subculture {{first appeared}} in the UK around 1983, when many ex-skinheads began dressing in designer clothing and sportswear to blend into the crowd and avoid police attention at soccer games. Popular clothing for English and Scottish casuals included Burberry coats, Stone Island, Lacoste, Ben Sherman and Fred Perry polo shirts, tracksuits, bomber jackets, Adidas or Nike sneakers, Fila or Ellesse jackets, flat caps, baseball caps, soccer shirts, and scarfs or bobble hats in their club's colours. Although shaved heads remained the most common haircut, some fans also wore undercuts, Caesar cuts, mod <b>haircuts,</b> and short mullet <b>haircuts.</b> During the late 80s, Casuals mostly listened to acid house, new wave music, and later indie rock or Madchester but a hip-hop influenced offshoot of the subculture, known as chavs, appeared during the late 1990s and early 2000s.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} model of central bank collateralized lending to study the optimal choice of the <b>haircut</b> policy. We show that a lending {{facility}} provides a bundle of two types of insurance: insurance against liquidity risk as well as insurance against downside risk of the collateral. Setting a <b>haircut</b> therefore involves balancing the trade-off between relaxing the liquidity constraints of agents on one hand, and increasing potential inflation risk and distorting the portfolio choices of agents on the other. We argue that the optimal <b>haircut</b> is higher when the central bank is unable to lend exclusively to agents who actually need liquidity. Finally, for an unexpected drop in the <b>haircut,</b> the central bank can be more aggressive than when setting a permanent level of the <b>haircut.</b> Payment, clearing, and settlement systems; Central bank research; Monetary policy implementation; Financial system regulation and policies; Financial services...|$|R

5000|$|It was Lindbergh who, in {{the fall}} of 1988, {{suggested}} to Evangelista that she cut her hair short after seeing her try on a short wig for a photoshoot. Consequently, she got a short gamine <b>haircut</b> from the French hairstylist Julien dYs. The following day, she was photographed by Lindbergh, which resulted in a now-famous photograph known as [...] "the white shirt picture". Initially, the <b>haircut</b> was not well received by the fashion industry, and Evangelista was cancelled from 16 fashion shows. However, by the spring of 1989, Evangelistas <b>haircut</b> was the look of the season. The <b>haircut</b> was referred to as [...] "The Linda", and it inspired the creation of a wig called [...] "The Evangelista". Even famous women sought to emulate the look. Among them were Demi Moore, who sported the <b>haircut</b> in the 1990 film Ghost, and Susan Sullivan from the television show Falcon Crest. It has been said of Evangelista that [...] "the worlds most famous <b>haircut</b> turned her from an averagely in-demand top model to an insanely in-demand, only-Linda-will-do top model, so sensationally successful that the word supermodel had to be coined to describe her".|$|R
