50|$|Many tax systems tax {{individuals}} in one manner and entities {{that are not}} considered <b>fiscally</b> <b>transparent</b> in another. The differences may {{be as simple as}} differences in tax rates, and are often motivated by concerns unique to either individuals or corporations. For example, many systems allow taxable income of an individual to be reduced by a fixed amount allowance for other persons supported by the individual (dependents). Such a concept is not relevant for enterprises.|$|E
40|$|This paper takes sample tax {{regimes and}} tendencies from the {{developed}} countries in the EU- 15 and the USA, and uses them to analyse the influence of taxation on the choice of organizational form of profit-oriented entities in Serbia. In order {{to understand how the}} procedure of taxation affects the sphere of business decision-making it is necessary to focus on the tax status of business losses and valorization and the effects of the double taxation of dividends. The rule of successive deduction of losses ensures the <b>fiscally</b> <b>transparent</b> entity receives a tax saving {{in the form of a}} reduction of the present value of the total paid tax. Meanwhile the corporation is handicapped because it postpones loss deductions, that is, it postpones tax saving, which directly influences the level of the present value of saved tax. The global trend of gradually moving from the classical system towards shareholder relief provision, above all in the form of a reduced withholding tax rate on dividends, has two opposing features: it simplifies the tax procedure while neglecting the distributional aims (consequences) of taxation. The analysis of a particular practical example from the Serbian tax context enables us to draw a conclusion in relation to the relative taxes paid by entrepreneurs versus enterprises. The developed countries favour <b>fiscally</b> <b>transparent</b> entities, whereas Serbia allocates tax privileges to enterprises...|$|E

40|$|Following several {{corporate}} accounting scandals many {{opted for}} greater corporate transparency whereas people almost blindly trusted state authorities and their released information especially on fiscal data. This attitude {{changed in the}} aftermath of several crisis in emerging market economies {{during the second half of}} the 1990 s, which led the IMF to push for greater transparency of countries ’ fiscal positions. This initiative steadily gained support and the case of Greek’s misreporting of fiscal data to Eurostat revealed that a lack of fiscal transparency is not only a problem of low-income countries. Fiscal transparency can be defined as the openness about policy intentions, formulation, and implementation and is regarded as a key element of good governance. In addition to the more familiar factors, transparency and good institutions are now among the generally accepted fundamentals that promote investment and growth. This development is occurring in tandem with the focus on the role of institutions in promoting economic growth and explaining growth differentials around the world. Empirical studies reveal that countries that are less <b>fiscally</b> <b>transparent</b> tend to experience slower growth rates, lower levels of per capita GDP, higher budget deficits, an...|$|E

According to Garowe Online, to bolster the region's justice system, numerous new prosecutors, judges and other court personnel as well as additional prison guards were hired and trained. In July 2010, the Puntland Council of Ministers unanimously approved a new anti-terrorism law to more efficiently handle terror suspects and their accomplices; a special court {{is also expected to}} be established within the region's existing criminal courts system to facilitate the task. <b>Fiscally,</b> a <b>transparent,</b> budget-based public finance system was established, which has reportedly helped increase public confidence in government. In addition, a new regional constitution was drafted and later passed on 15 June 2009, which is believed to represent a significant step toward the eventual introduction of a multi-party political system to the region for the first time; such a system already exists in the adjacent Somaliland region. More modest reforms were also put into motion in the social sector, particularly in the education and healthcare fields. The regional government has hired more healthcare workers and teachers, with major plans underway for school and hospital renovations. One of the most significant new reforms enacted by the incumbent Puntland administration is the launching in May 2009 of the Puntland Agency for Social Welfare (PASWE), the first organization of its kind in Somali history. The agency provides medical, educational and counseling support to vulnerable groups and individuals such as orphans, the disabled and the blind. PASWE is overseen by a Board of Directors, which consists of religious scholars (ulema), businesspeople, intellectuals and traditional elders.|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} three decades, large and {{persistent}} discrepancies between the annual change in public debt and the budget deficit, so-called stock-flow adjustments, were a prominent feature of debt dynamics in many economies. The aim {{of this paper is}} to investigate the underlying determinants of such discrepancies and their relationship with fiscal transparency using data for 163 countries. Results show that such discrepancies can only be partly explained by balance sheet effects and the realization of contingent liabilities and that significant differences exist in average stock-flow adjustments across countries reflecting country-specific factors. The more <b>fiscally</b> <b>transparent</b> the country, the smaller these tend to be. The contribution of stock-flow adjustments to increases in debt is likewise smaller in countries with above average fiscal transparency.

40|$|Since {{the early}} stages of the Hawke government, Australias {{taxation}} system has been modified with a view to attracting additional capital into the domestic venture capital market. In December 2002, the Howard government enacted the Taxation Laws Amendment (Venture Capital) Act 2002 (Cth) and the Venture Capital Act 2002 (Cth). This legislative package created a prospective concession primarily aimed at qualifying limited partnerships who participate in the Australian venture capital market. Subject to a rather stringent qualification criteria, such partnerships are treated as <b>fiscally</b> <b>transparent</b> for the purposes of Australian taxation law. In addition, the gains made upon the disposal of portfolio investments by these partnerships may not be subject to Australian capital gains tax ("CGT") or otherwise assessable as ordinary income. The central concept of these measures is the venture capital limited partnership ("VCLP"), and other fund of fund organisational forms which are founded on the limited partnership. For this reason, the provisions of the Taxation Laws Amendment (Venture Capital) Act 2002 (Cth) and the Venture Capital Act 2002 (Cth) are collectively identified as the "VCLP Concessions". This thesis has been prepared as a rigorous assessment of the VCLP Concessions. It draws upon an analysis of the nature and structure of venture capital investing to determine whether the particular features of the VCLP Concessions appropriately cater for the needs of prospective foreign investors. The efficacy and appropriateness of the VCLP Concessions from a policy perspective is also examined. Recommendations are provided which, if enacted, would address regions of structural inconsistency and improve the functioning of this concessional regime...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} establish whether {{the presence or}} activities of a partner or partners in South Africa creates (or is at risk of creating) a permanent establishment for that partner, the partnership or the co-partners in South Africa. At the outset, the major legal and fiscal consequences of a partnership under South African law are investigated. The unique legal and fiscal treatment of a partnership as a mere aggregate of persons that is treated as <b>fiscally</b> <b>transparent</b> under South African law is relevant to determine the potential application of double taxation agreements to partnerships or their partners. Once {{the terms of a}} double taxation agreement are found to apply in the circumstances, the creation of a permanent establishment in terms thereof becomes relevant. The different types of partnerships and partners under South African partnership law are set out and their differentiating characteristics analysed in an effort to identify whether the activities or presence of certain partners are more at risk of giving rise to a permanent establishment than others. In a commercial context, the important distinction is drawn between ordinary and extraordinary partners as very different commercial consequences attach to these partners. In particular, whereas ordinary partners automatically derive an implied authority or mutual mandate to manage the business of the partnership as agents of their co-partners by virtue of the partnership agreement, extraordinary partners are excluded from the mutual mandate. The implied authority amongst partners becomes particularly relevant when considering one of the alternative tests for creating a permanent establishment that appear in the prevalent model tax conventions commonly used in the South African context, in terms of which the existence of authority is one of the required elements {{for the creation of a}} permanent establishment. The special rules surrounding the source of partnership income is investigated as a means of establishing jurisdiction to tax under South African domestic source rules. The impact of legislation on the South African source rules pertaining to partnerships as developed under the common law is critically analysed and the relevance of source rules in the permanent establishment context is evaluated. It is submitted that it is premature to consider the rules surrounding the creation of a permanent establishment under the terms of a double taxation agreement before it is established that the relevant contracting state has the requisite jurisdiction to tax and furthermore that the terms of that double taxation agreement apply to the matter at hand. Finally, the relevant articles of the model tax conventions commonly used in the South African context are discussed with specific focus on the unique attributes of a partnership that may impact on the creation of a permanent establishment for the partner or partners by virtue of the presence or activities of a partner or the partners in South Africa. The risk of creating a permanent establishment by virtue of the presence or activities of an ordinary partner in South Africa is contrasted with that of an extraordinary partner. It is concluded that the activities or presence of ordinary partners (as opposed to extraordinary partners) are particularly at risk of creating a permanent establishment in South Africa, although it is acknowledged that certain requirements will have to be met on the facts of each case before a permanent establishment will be found to exist...|$|E
