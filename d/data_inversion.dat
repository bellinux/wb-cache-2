40|$|Our {{research}} group aims {{to develop a}} physics-based predictive simulation system for crustal activities in and around Japan, which consists of a combined simulation model for quasi-static stress accumulation and dynamic rupture propagation and the associated data assimilation software. In the first phase (2003 - 2005), we constructed a prototype of the combined simulation model on a realistic 3 -D structure model. In the second phase (2006 - 2008), we tested the validity and applicability of the combined simulation model, and demonstrated that the physics-based computer simulation is useful for the quantitative evaluation of strong ground motions that will be produced by potential interplate earthquakes. We also developed the associated data assimilation software; that is, a GPS <b>data</b> <b>inversion</b> method to estimate interplate coupling rates, a CMT <b>data</b> <b>inversion</b> method to estimate crustal stress fields, and a GPS inversion method to estimate 3 -D elastic/inelastic strain fields.

30|$|As {{mentioned}} {{before the two}} synthetic data sets (generated before and after adding 3 % random noise) are inverted with incorporating mapping data of subsurface stratigraphy from prior surveys (e.g. seismic, borehole logs). These two apparent resistivity data sets were inverted by incorporating layer interfaces and fixing resistivity regions, respectively, both are outside the reservoir layer. ERT <b>data</b> <b>inversions</b> reconstruct directly the true subsurface resistivity tomograms including the study gas plume of downward gradual desaturation. This implies no model differencing, unlike seismic results showing the model difference {{before and after the}} gas injection. Of all differently independent inversions, every best-fitting tomogram shows least root mean square (rms)-errors of < 0.5 % and iteration number almost of 5, and is optimized with the L 1 norm for sharp interfaces. Also this low rms-error value is explained by the good convergence of the synthetic data sets toward the final solution. This L 1 norm yields significantly more accurate results than L 2 norm, where the actual subsurface resistivity changes abruptly at sharp target boundaries (cf. Loke et al. 2013). It is more likely to suppose that considerable subsurface information is already available during monitoring from the detailed baseline survey and any other subsequent survey. The a priori incorporation of this mapping <b>data</b> in ERT <b>inversions</b> minimizes the ambiguity of the solution and enhances the resolution of results. Here each <b>data</b> set <b>inversion</b> is constrained by incorporating resistivity regions and interfaces outside the reservoir, respectively.|$|R

40|$|The {{predominant}} {{factors which}} prohibit the inversion of acoustic scattering {{data for the}} purposes of flaw characterization are 1) limited angular access to the flaw, 2) limited temporal frequency signal bandwidth, and 3) lack of absolute phase information between individual measurements (zero of time problem). An additional complication which impedes the <b>data</b> <b>inversion</b> is the non-linear dependence of the scattering data on the scattering object. This problem must be handled by either linearizing the problem or by applying an iterative procedure which may have questionable convergence properties. An approach to <b>data</b> <b>inversion</b> is presented here which shows potential in overcoming the aforementioned difficulties. This approach compensates for the lack of data by constructing a solution which yields simulated scattering consistent with the measured data, while simultaneously minimizing a functional measure of the support (i. e. volume) of the flaw. Such an approach to limited <b>data</b> <b>inversion</b> has proven effective in limited view X-ray CT applications when reconstructing discontinuous boundary flaws such as cracks and inclusions [1, 2, 3]. The application presented here is by-and-large analogous to the X-ray CT application, except for the additional complication of the lack of absolute phase between measurements.

30|$|The {{well-known}} thin-sheet modeling {{has become}} a very useful interpretation tool in electromagnetic (EM) methods. The thin-sheet model approximates fairly well 3 -D heterogeneities having a limited vertical dimension.
