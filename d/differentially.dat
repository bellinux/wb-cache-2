5|$|The EFS gene {{is one of}} {{more than}} 100 of the genes located in a centromeric 10.21 Mb “minimal {{critical}} region” on Chromosome 14 that are highly expressed in gestational choriocarcinoma. The EFS mRNA was also identified as <b>differentially</b> expressed in two of the three groups of glioblastoma multiforme as identified by gene expression profiles (GEPs). EFS was <b>differentially</b> expressed in the GEP1 and GEP3 groups, which were associated with worse prognosis, with more significant cytogenetic abnormalities and genomic instabilities observed in this groups.|$|E
5|$|RNA {{interference}} is also {{a promising}} way to treat cancers by silencing genes <b>differentially</b> upregulated in tumor cells or genes involved in cell division. A key area {{of research in the}} use of RNAi for clinical applications is the development of a safe delivery method, which to date has involved mainly viral vector systems similar to those suggested for gene therapy.|$|E
5|$|Pollination is {{the process}} by which pollen is {{transferred}} in the reproduction of plants, thereby enabling fertilisation and sexual reproduction. Most flowering plants require an animal to do the transportation. While other animals are included as pollinators, the majority of pollination is done by insects. Because insects usually receive benefit for the pollination in the form of energy rich nectar it is a grand example of mutualism. The various flower traits (and combinations thereof) that <b>differentially</b> attract one type of pollinator or another are known as pollination syndromes. These arose through complex plant-animal adaptations. Pollinators find flowers through bright colorations, including ultraviolet, and attractant pheromones. The study of pollination by insects is known as anthecology.|$|E
5|$|Since {{they were}} named, the {{proteins}} {{have been found}} to be <b>differentially</b> expressed in other glands that secrete products directly into the external environment. These include lacrimal, parotid, submaxillary, sublingual, preputial and mammary glands. In some species, such as cats and pigs, Mups appear not to be expressed in urine at all and are mainly found in saliva. Sometimes the term urinary Mups (uMups) is used to distinguish those Mups expressed in urine from those in other tissues.|$|E
5|$|In 1986 {{individual}} Navy SEALs from a West Coast {{team had}} been using personally purchased custom fixed-blade knives made by Southern California knifemaker Phill Hartsfield. Hartsfield's knives were hard ground from <b>differentially</b> heat-treated A2 tool steel and {{are known for their}} distinctive chisel-ground blades. More accurately, they are zero ground; that is, the edge has no secondary bevel, minimizing drag when used for cutting purposes. Emerson had long been impressed by the cutting ability of the chisel-ground edge and had asked Hartsfield's permission to incorporate it into his own folding knives, which Hartsfield granted. When the SEALs asked Hartsfield to make them a folding knife, he informed them that he did not make folding knives and referred them to Emerson.|$|E

25|$|In {{metazoan}} cells, {{there are}} A and B type lamins, which {{differ in their}} length and pI. Human cells have three <b>differentially</b> regulated genes.|$|E
25|$|A <b>differentially</b> closed {{field is}} stable. If it has non-zero {{characteristic}} {{it is not}} superstable, and if it has zero characteristic it is totally transcendental.|$|E
25|$|He {{has voted}} against net {{neutrality}} legislation, {{which holds that}} internet service providers cannot discriminate or charge <b>differentially</b> by user, content, website, platform, or application.|$|E
25|$|As above for {{pitch and}} roll, {{but with the}} rudder locked and the pedals {{operating}} the ailerons / airbrakes <b>differentially</b> for yaw, lateral control prove barely adequate.|$|E
25|$|A {{distinct}} SI mechanism {{exists in}} heterostylous flowers, termed heteromorphic self-incompatibility. This mechanism {{is probably not}} evolutionarily related to the more familiar mechanisms, which are <b>differentially</b> defined as homomorphic self-incompatibility.|$|E
25|$|Helioseismic {{observations}} {{reveal the}} inner uniformly rotating zone and the <b>differentially</b> rotating envelope of the Sun, roughly {{corresponding to the}} radiation and convection zones, respectively. See the diagram on the right. The transition layer is called the tachocline.|$|E
25|$|Comparisons of cystic {{fibrosis}} against non-{{cystic fibrosis}} airway epithelial cells shows that various miRNAs are <b>differentially</b> regulated {{in response to}} the disease. mir-126 is suspected {{to play a role in}} regulating the innate immune responses within Cystic Fibrosis affected lungs.|$|E
25|$|Depressive symptoms, if seen in CFS, may be <b>differentially</b> {{diagnosed}} from {{primary depression}} {{by the absence}} of anhedonia, decreased motivation, and guilt; and the presence of somatic symptoms such as sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, and exercise intolerance with post exertional exacerbation of symptoms.|$|E
25|$|A {{companion}} paper examined segmental duplications {{in the two}} genomes, whose insertion and deletion {{into the}} genome account {{for much of the}} indel sequence. They found that a total of 2.7% of euchromatic sequence had been <b>differentially</b> duplicated in one or the other lineage.|$|E
25|$|<b>Differentially</b> {{methylated}} {{regions are}} generally segments of DNA rich in cytosine and guanine nucleotides, with the cytosine nucleotides methylated on one copy {{but not on}} the other. Contrary to expectation, methylation does not necessarily mean silencing; instead, the effect of methylation depends upon the default state of the region.|$|E
25|$|Friends and foes are {{represented}} {{differently in the}} brain. The fusiform cortex, posterior cingulate gyrus, amygdala, and areas involved in motivational control were <b>differentially</b> activated {{as a function of}} previous social encounters. In general, these areas were more active when faces were perceived as foes rather than friends.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolution}} of human bipedalism began in primates about four million years ago, or {{as early as}} seven million years ago with Sahelanthropus. One hypothesis for human bipedalism is that it evolved {{as a result of}} <b>differentially</b> successful survival from carrying food to share with group members, although there are alternative hypotheses.|$|E
25|$|Borax as {{a source}} of borate has been used to take {{advantage}} of the co-complexing ability of borate with other agents in water to form complex ions with various substances. Borate and a suitable polymer bed are used to chromatograph non-glycosylated hemoglobin <b>differentially</b> from glycosylated hemoglobin (chiefly HbA1c), which is an indicator of long term hyperglycemia in diabetes mellitus.|$|E
25|$|More commonly, {{the process}} of {{pollination}} requires pollinators: organisms that carry or move the pollen grains from the anther of one flower to the receptive part of the carpel or pistil (stigma) of another. This is biotic pollination. The various flower traits (and combinations thereof) that <b>differentially</b> attract one type of pollinator or another are known as pollination syndromes.|$|E
25|$|Rather than {{identify}} <b>differentially</b> expressed genes using a {{fold change}} cutoff, {{one can use}} a variety of statistical tests or omnibus tests such as ANOVA, all of which consider both fold change and variability to create a p-value, an estimate of how often we would observe the data by chance alone. Applying p-values to microarrays is complicated by the large number of multiple comparisons (genes) involved. For example, a p-value of 0.05 is typically thought to indicate significance, since it estimates a 5% probability of observing the data by chance. But with 10,000 genes on a microarray, 500 genes would be identified as significant at p < 0.05 even if there were no difference between the experimental groups. One obvious solution is to consider significant only those genes meeting a much more stringent p value criterion, e.g., one could perform a Bonferroni correction on the p-values, or use a false discovery rate calculation to adjust p-values in proportion to the number of parallel tests involved. Unfortunately, these approaches may reduce the number of significant genes to zero, even when genes are in fact <b>differentially</b> expressed. Current statistics such as Rank products aim {{to strike a balance between}} false discovery of genes due to chance variation and non-discovery of <b>differentially</b> expressed genes. Commonly cited methods include the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) and a wide variety of methods are available from Bioconductor and a variety of analysis packages from bioinformatics companies.|$|E
25|$|The monarch was {{the first}} {{butterfly}} to have its genome sequenced. The 273-million base pair draft sequence includes a set of 16,866 protein-coding genes. The genome provides researchers insights into migratory behavior, the circadian clock, juvenile hormone pathways and microRNAs that are <b>differentially</b> expressed between summer and migratory monarchs. More recently, the genetic basis of monarch migration and warning coloration has been described.|$|E
25|$|Two isoforms {{are known}} and the gene is {{expressed}} {{in a wide variety}} of tissues including kidney, thymus, stomach, breast, adult liver and erythrocyte. In the non erythroid cell lines, expression is lower than in the erythrocyte and the protein is <b>differentially</b> glycosylated. In the erythrocyte glycophorin C makes up ~4% of the membrane sialoglycoproteins. The average number of O linked chains is 12 per molecule.|$|E
25|$|As {{the number}} of {{replicate}} measurements in a microarray experiment increases, various statistical approaches yield increasingly similar results, but lack of concordance between different statistical methods makes array results appear less trustworthy. The MAQC Project makes recommendations to guide researchers in selecting more standard methods (e.g. using p-value and fold-change together for selecting the <b>differentially</b> expressed genes) so that experiments performed in different laboratories will agree better.|$|E
25|$|Microbes form a biofilm in {{response}} to many factors, which may include cellular recognition of specific or non-specific attachment sites on a surface, nutritional cues, or in some cases, by exposure of planktonic cells to sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics. When a cell switches to the biofilm mode of growth, it undergoes a phenotypic shift in behavior in which large suites of genes are <b>differentially</b> regulated.|$|E
25|$|An elegant {{demonstration}} {{of the power of}} asymmetric organocatalytic aldol reactions was disclosed by MacMillan and coworkers in 2004 in their synthesis of <b>differentially</b> protected carbohydrates. While traditional synthetic methods accomplish the synthesis of hexoses using variations of iterative protection-deprotection strategies, requiring 8–14 steps, organocatalysis can access many of the same substrates using an efficient two-step protocol involving the proline-catalyzed dimerization of alpha-oxyaldehydes followed by tandem Mukaiyama aldol cyclization.|$|E
25|$|Another {{possibility}} is that common diseases arise in part through the action of combinations of variants that are individually rare. Most of the disease-associated alleles discovered to date have been rare, and rare variants {{are more likely than}} common variants to be <b>differentially</b> distributed among groups distinguished by ancestry. However, groups could harbor different, though perhaps overlapping, sets of rare variants, which would reduce contrasts between groups in the incidence of the disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{grouping}} of imprinted genes within clusters {{allows them to}} share common regulatory elements, such as non-coding RNAs and <b>differentially</b> methylated regions (DMRs). When these regulatory elements control the imprinting {{of one or more}} genes, they are known as imprinting control regions (ICR). The expression of non-coding RNAs, such as Air on mouse chromosome 17 and KCNQ1OT1 on human chromosome 11p15.5, {{have been shown to be}} essential for the imprinting of genes in their corresponding regions.|$|E
25|$|Creatine and Uric acid {{levels are}} lower than normal, at least in women. Ex vivo CD4(+) T cells {{isolated}} from the circulation show a wrong TIM-3 (Immunoregulation) behavior, and relapses are associated with CD8(+) T Cells. There {{is a set of}} <b>differentially</b> expressed genes between MS and healthy subjects in peripheral blood T cells from clinically active MS patients. There are also differences between acute relapses and complete remissions. Platelets are known to have abnormal high levels.|$|E
25|$|As {{was done}} with Chinese characters, Japanese Buddhist {{scholars}} sometimes created multiple characters with the same phonological value to add meaning to Siddhaṃ characters. This practice, in effect, represents a 'blend' of the Chinese style of writing and the Indian style of writing and allows Sanskrit texts in Siddhaṃ to be <b>differentially</b> interpreted as they are read, as {{was done with}} Chinese characters that the Japanese had adopted. This led to multiple variants of the same characters.|$|E
25|$|HIV, the {{retrovirus}} {{that causes}} AIDS in humans, produces a single primary RNA transcript, which is alternatively spliced in multiple ways to produce over 40 different mRNAs. Equilibrium among <b>differentially</b> spliced transcripts provides multiple mRNAs encoding different {{products that are}} required for viral multiplication. One of the <b>differentially</b> spliced transcripts contains the tat gene, in which exon 2 is a cassette exon that may be skipped or included. The inclusion of tat exon 2 in the RNA is regulated by competition between the splicing repressor hnRNP A1 and the SR protein SC35. Within exon 2 an exonic splicing silencer sequence (ESS) and an exonic splicing enhancer sequence (ESE) overlap. If A1 repressor protein binds to the ESS, it initiates cooperative binding of multiple A1 molecules, extending into the 5’ donor site upstream of exon 2 and preventing the binding of the core splicing factor U2AF35 to the polypyrimidine tract. If SC35 binds to the ESE, it prevents A1 binding and maintains the 5’ donor site in an accessible state for assembly of the spliceosome. Competition between the activator and repressor ensures that both mRNA types (with and without exon 2) are produced.|$|E
25|$|QDMR (Quantitative <b>Differentially</b> Methylated Regions) is a {{quantitative}} approach to quantify methylation difference and identify DMRs from genome-wide methylation profiles by adapting Shannon entropy /bioinfo.hrbmu.edu.cn/qdmr>. The platform-free and species-free nature of QDMR makes it potentially applicable to various methylation data. This approach provides an effective {{tool for the}} high-throughput identification of the functional regions involved in epigenetic regulation. QDMR {{can be used as}} an effective tool for the quantification of methylation difference and identification of DMRs across multiple samples.|$|E
25|$|CCDC130 {{has shown}} to be <b>differentially</b> {{expressed}} in several cancers, including breast, colon, and pancreatic through microarray studies of cancer cells. It was {{shown to be}} down-regulated in colon cancers, suggesting {{that it could be}} a biomarker for cancers. There is still research being done on this topic to confirm its function as a cancer identifier. Many websites also say that it is involved in the cell's response to viral infection, but there is no specific information on this nor any elaboration.|$|E
25|$|A new trailing-edge {{high-lift}} device {{has been}} adopted with an advanced dropped-hinge flap {{similar to that of}} the Airbus A380, which permits the gap between the trailing edge and the flap to be closed with the spoiler. It is a limited morphing wing with adaptive features for continuously optimising the wing loading to reduce fuel burn: variable camber for longitudinal load control where inboard & outboard flaps deflect together and differential flaps setting for lateral load control where inboard & outboard flaps deflect <b>differentially.</b>|$|E
25|$|Similar to mammals, {{chickens}} seem to use CpG islands (segments of Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine {{that are}} more readily methylated and silenced than other DNA segments) to regulate gene expression. One study found that CpG islands were found primarily in compensated areas of the Z chromosome—areas that are <b>differentially</b> expressed in male and female chickens. Thus {{it is likely that}} these CpG islands are locations where genes on the male Z chromosome are methylated and silenced, but which stay functional on the female Z chromosome.|$|E
25|$|Various {{methods have}} been used to {{identify}} imprinted genes. In swine, Bischoff et al. 2009 compared transcriptional profiles using short-oligonucleotide microarrays to survey <b>differentially</b> expressed genes between parthenotes (2 maternal genomes) and control fetuses (1 maternal, 1 paternal genome). An intriguing study surveying the transcriptome of murine brain tissues revealed over 1300 imprinted gene loci (approximately 10-fold more than previously reported) by RNA-sequencing from F1 hybrids resulting from reciprocal crosses. The result however has been challenged by others who claimed that this is an overestimation by an order of magnitude due to flawed statistical analysis.|$|E
