To assist both types of comic book collector, comic book <b>price</b> <b>guides</b> are available and provide estimates of comic book values {{as well as information}} on comic book creators and characters. The <b>price</b> <b>guides</b> assign values for comic books based on demand, availability, and the copy's condition. The longest running <b>price</b> <b>guide</b> is the annual Overstreet <b>Price</b> <b>Guide,</b> first published in 1970. Another current monthly <b>price</b> <b>guide</b> is Comics Buyer's Guide. The growth of the Internet in the late 1990s saw development of online databases to track creator, character appearances, and storylines, as well as websites combining comic book <b>price</b> <b>guides</b> with personalized collection tracking to provide collection values in real-time. The Grand Comics Database is a popular online resource for comic book creator and character information. Popular online <b>price</b> <b>guide</b> and collection tracking services include comicbookrealm.com, comicspriceguide.com, and GPAnalysis. The increased popularity of online auctioning services like eBay or Heritage Auctions for buying and selling comic books has greatly increased the visibility of actual comic book sale prices, leading to improved <b>price</b> <b>guide</b> accuracy, particularly for online <b>price</b> <b>guides</b> such as comicspriceguide.com and GPAnalysis.
