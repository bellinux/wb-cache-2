40|$|Abstract: Composite {{materials}} are important engineering materials {{due to their}} outstanding mechanical properties. Metal matrix composite (MMCs) {{are one of the}} widely known composites because of their superior properties such as high strength, hardness, stiffness, and corrosion resistances. Al-TiBr 2 produces higher tool wear, poor surface roughness and minimizes the metal removal rate. The quality of the material is influenced by the cutting conditions, tool material and geometry. The present work is focusing on multiple response optimization of <b>drilling</b> <b>process</b> for composite Al-TiBr 2. The study provided to minimise the damage events occurring during <b>drilling</b> <b>process</b> for composite material. A statistical approach used to analyse experiment data. Taguchi method with grey relational analysis was used to optimize the machining parameters with multiple performance characteristics in drilling of MMC Al-TiBr 2.

40|$|<b>Drilling</b> <b>Process</b> Monitoring (DPM) {{technique}} {{has been developed}} and investigated at HKU {{for more than ten}} years, which can continuously measure and record the full <b>drilling</b> <b>process</b> in real time series while the hole is being drilled. It has been applied to the ground investigation, weathered rocks characterization, slope upgrading, SPT test and so forth. DPM technique includes transducer system and data acquisition system. This technique can be mounted on many types of drilling machines. In <b>drilling</b> <b>process,</b> the <b>drilling</b> bit contacts the drilling material directly, which means the <b>drilling</b> <b>process</b> has a close relation with mechanical properties of drilling material. So the <b>drilling</b> <b>process</b> can be considered as an in-situ test of rock mechanical properties. The major obstacle {{is that it is not}} easy to grasp the basic mechanic properties of natural materials. As the physical and mechanical properties of concrete are similar to those of intact rock, it is a suitable material for the purpose of this study and is henceforth termed as artificial geo-materials. Therefore, the main aim of the first part of this study was to investigate the specific relationships between the drilling parameters and mechanical parameters of artificial geo-materials in the <b>drilling</b> <b>process.</b> The second part of this study introduced DPM method in the ground investigation in Tongchuan. The main objective of in-situ DPM tests is to use DPM method to characterize rock stratum along the borehole.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to establish a detailed process anatomy of a micro-hole <b>drilling</b> <b>process</b> using a CW single-mode 300 W fiber laser with short micro-second pulses. For the <b>drilling</b> <b>process</b> with a one micro-second laser pulse, the process started with drastic evaporation and concluded with melt ejection approximately 150 micro-seconds later. It was concluded that two distinct hole drilling mechanisms occurred, one as adiabatic evaporation by the high power initial spike of the laser beam and one as melt ejection by the low power laser energy deposition. The <b>drilling</b> <b>process</b> time line was established based on the measurements by several in-process sensors, such as photodiodes, a high-speed camera, and a spectrometer. The theoretical modeling zoomed in the early stage of the process to investigate the hole formation which could not be observed experimentally. Both experimental and theoretical results were then compared to determine the laser-material interaction mechanisms among three media involved in the process: laser, material, and vapour/plasma. Finally, a series of temporal anatomy diagrams, denoted as process anatomy, were presented to describe the entire <b>drilling</b> <b>process,</b> including process temperature, laser energy deposition, hole formation, and material remova...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} an intelligent control and optimization framework for managed pressure drilling systems. The nonlinear <b>drilling</b> <b>process</b> model was configured in a closed-loop feedback control framework {{to optimize the}} oil <b>drilling</b> <b>process</b> performance. Two main process components, namely, the mud pump flow rate and the differential flow rate of the backpressure pump and the choke, {{are assumed to be}} the control inputs while the process down hole pressure rate is treated as the process output. The control, optimization and automation of the <b>drilling</b> <b>process</b> are investigated by designing an intelligent fuzzy logic controller in a tracking problem for real-time implementation, by utilizing the closed loop system tracking error and the error rate as the controller inputs and by generating incremental changes for the two process inputs. Although the proposed control system framework is inherently nonlinear due to the nonlinear process model and the nonlinear intelligent control, the process control input and output parameters have been successfully achieved. The proposed control framework simulation results clearly illustrate that the managed pressure <b>drilling</b> <b>process</b> can be optimized as a closed loop control tracking problem, effectively removing the need for complex controller design and allowing real-time implementation in manufacturing operations in operator support systems...|$|R
