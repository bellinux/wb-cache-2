40|$|Seed {{dispersal}} in aquatic habitats {{is often}} {{considered to be}} a complex multistage process, where initial seed shadows are redistributed by water (<b>hydrochory).</b> The roles of <b>hydrochory</b> in seed dispersal and influencing population genetic structure were examined in Helmholtzia glaberrima using both ecological and genetic techniques. Ecological experiments showed that water can redistribute seeds and seedlings over local scales and that <b>hydrochory</b> can provide the potential for very long distance seed and seedling dispersal. Patterns of seedling genetic structure were affected by micro-drainages that direct water flow within populations and influence water-borne seed dispersal on a local scale. Strong non-equilibrium dynamics and persistent founder effects were responsible for the patterns of genetic structure observed among established populations of H. glaberrima. Classical metapopulation models best described dispersal patterns, while water-borne seed dispersal could potentially explain patterns of genetic differentiation within a stream system, it could not explain the distribution of genetic variation among stream systems. The current study found that although <b>hydrochory</b> influenced seed dispersal and seedling genetic structure within a population, it had little effect on the spatial pattern of genetic variation among established populations of H. glaberrima. Moreover, even though prolonged buoyancy and viability in water provide the potential for long-distance <b>hydrochory,</b> results presented here do not support the hypothesis that flowing water is an effective long distance seed dispersal vector for H. glaberrima. Taken together, these results suggest that the relative importance of gene flow via water-born seed dispersal in H. glaberrima may be low compared with that of some other riparian species...|$|E
40|$|Vegetation along rivers is an {{important}} feature affecting {{the functioning of the}} entire riverine ecosystem. The structure of riparian vegetation is shaped to a considerable degree by the dispersal of seeds by water, also known as <b>hydrochory.</b> Mostly buoyant seeds are transported by <b>hydrochory,</b> but non-buoyant seeds are also transported. A series of laboratory experiments were conducted on 8 different types of non-buoyant seeds to see if the theory used for sediment could apply to seeds. This study suggests that in water, seeds respond in a similar way to sediment and the tools used for sediment can be extended to seeds also. The key factor in the sorting of buoyant seeds by <b>hydrochory</b> (leading to spatial species differentiation) is usually considered to be the effect of potential duration of buoyancy, which has received much interest.

40|$|Riparian {{systems are}} prone to {{invasion}} by alien plant species. The spread of invasive riparian plants may be facilitated by <b>hydrochory,</b> the transport of seeds by water, but while ecological studies have highlighted the possible role of upstream source populations in the establishment and persistence of stands of invasive riparian plant species, population genetic studies have as yet not fully addressed the potential role of hydrochoric dispersal in such systems. A population genetics approach based on a replicated bifurcate sampling design is used to test hypotheses consistent with patterns of unidirectional, linear gene flow expected under hydrochoric dispersal of the invasive riparian plant Impatiens glandulifera in two contrasting river systems. A significant increase in levels of genetic diversity downstream was observed, consistent with the accumulation of propagules from upstream source populations, and strong evidence was found for organization of this diversity between different tributaries, reflecting the dendritic organization of the river systems studied.

Fine sediment retention can be accompanied by deposition of seeds transported by water dispersal, i. e. by <b>hydrochory.</b> We tested the hypothesis that pioneer riparian trees significantly control seed deposition on gravel bars by forming sediment obstacle marks. We described the seed bank structure and compared samples col- lected from obstacle marks and bare coarse-grained bar surfaces. At the surface (at 2 cm depth), seed abundance (N) and richness (S) (expressed as mean ±sd) were significantly higher in areas directly af- fected by riparian trees, i. e. obstacle marks, (N : 693 ± 391; S : 17 ± 3) than in bare surfaces (N : 334 ± 371; S : 13 ± 5).

40|$|Question: How {{important}} is <b>hydrochory</b> for dispersing propagules along riverbanks {{and to what}} extent do the quantity and species composition of deposited propagules reflect the riparian vegetation, represent “new” species that are not present in the vegetation, and vary with river flow and season? Location: River Frome, Dorset, UK. Methods: Over 13 consecutive 6 -week time periods, during which river water levels were continuously monitored, aerial inputs of propagules to riverbanks were sampled using funnels, hydrochorous propagule transport was sampled using drift nets, and deposition across the riverbanks was sampled using astroturf mats. A survey of the riparian vegetation enabled comparison between samples and the standing vegetation, so that “new” species could be identified. Differences in propagule abundance and diversity between sampling methods, time periods and locations were tested using Mann-Whitney U-tests and Kruskall-Wallis ANOVA. DCA established contrasts in the floristic composition of all deposited propagules and “new” propagules between different sample types, time periods and locations. Results: Aerial seed fall generated few propagules of low species richness. <b>Hydrochory</b> introduced large numbers of propagules and new species, resulting in high propagule deposition on the riverbank. The number and diversity of deposited propagules was governed by seasonal patterns of seed release and the hydrological regime. Propagule deposition was significantly greater on the most frequently inundated parts of the riverbank and autumn floods were particularly important for transporting “new” species to the study site and for remobilizing previously released propagules. Conclusions: The abundance and diversity of propagules deposited along riverbanks is dependent upon high river flows, which facilitates connectivity between the channel and the riparian zone. ...|$|E

Methods We sampled the vegetation and soil seed banks of four tributaries and the reservoir tidal flats of their estuaries. Using data from 91 sample plots, we compared the species composition of the established vegetation and soil seed banks of the tributaries and their tidal flats using Sørensen’s coefficient of similarity, detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and two way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN). Important findings Species richness of the established vegetation and seed bank along the tributaries was considerably {{higher than in the}} reservoir tidal flats, but the density of seedlings germinated from the soil seed bank was not significantly different between the two habitats. TWINSPAN and DCA showed a separation of sites from the tributary and tidal flat zones.

40|$|Riparian {{ecosystems}} along streams naturally harbour a high plant diversity {{with many}} increasingly endangered species. In our current heavily modified and fragmented catchments, {{many of these}} species are sensitive to dispersal limitation. Better understanding of riparian plant dispersal pathways is required to predict species (re-) colonization potential and improve success rates of stream and riparian zone conservation and restoration. Dispersal by water (<b>hydrochory)</b> is an important mechanism for longitudinal and lateral dispersal of riparian species. Crucially for recruitment potential, it also influences the elevation along the riparian hydrological gradient where seeds become deposited. Due to the complex interplay between abiotic and biotic factors, however, it remains unclear how exactly patterns in seed deposition are formed. We compared hydrochorous and non-hydrochorous seed deposition, and quantified patterns of seed deposition along the bare substrate of newly created stream riparian gradients. Water levels were monitored and seed deposition was measured with seed traps along {{the full range of}} riparian hydrological conditions (from permanently flooded to never flooded). Average seed numbers and species richness were significantly higher in flooded than in non-flooded seed traps (5. 7 and 1. 5 times higher, respectively). Community-weighted trait means indicated that typically water-dispersed seeds were more dominant in flooded than in non-flooded seed traps and gradually decreased in concentration from the channel to the upland. Moreover, highly buoyant seeds accumulated at the average water line, and clear elevational sorting of non-buoyant seeds occurred within the floodplain. These results establish a critical role of flooding in shaping patterns of seed deposition along the riparian gradient, delivering many seeds of typical riparian species to riparian zones and depositing them at species-specific elevations as influenced by seed traits, suggesting species-specific dispersal pathways. This shows that <b>hydrochory</b> likely has important consequences for riparian vegetation development and that flooding forms a key process for successful restoration...|$|E

Through controlling the source of propagules (dispersed bywind, water, or both) reaching newly created, bare river margin sites, we isolated the relativeroles of dispersal and other factors in plant community development over five years. Replicated treatments were established at 12 sites spanning 400 km along two adjacent riversin northern Sweden, one fragmented {{by a series of}} dams, the other free-flowing. Bare rivermargins receiving only water-dispersed propagules had significantly higher species richnesscompared to plots receiving only wind-dispersed propagules during the initial two years ofcolonization. Species richness increased annually throughout the study along tranquil andturbulent reaches of the free-flowing river but reached an asymptote at comparatively lowrichness after a single year on the impounded river. Propagule source strongly influencedspecies richness during the initial establishment along both rivers, with richness beingsignificantly higher in plots receiving water-dispersed seeds. This strong treatment effectcontinued to be important through time along the regulated river but diminished inimportance along the free-flowing river where other factors such as soil moisture, lightavailability, and exposure of sites to fluvial disturbance overshadowed the influence ofdispersal pathway in mediating species richness. This suggests that <b>hydrochory</b> (plantdispersal by water) may be more important for maintenance of diversity in regulated systemswhere long-distance dispersal is absent or negligible, but that the rich local propagule sourcealong free-flowing rivers supports high species richness. The number of unique species washigher in water-dispersal plots along both the regulated and free-flowing rivers. This resultsuggests that <b>hydrochory</b> may contribute to temporal variability of sites, may enhance richnessover time, and may have an important role in meta-population and meta-communitydynamics of plant communities through long-distance (and local) dispersal and chancecolonization. Our findings provide experimental evidence that water dispersal of plantpropagules influences colonization dynamics and is important for long-term communitydevelopment in riparian zones...|$|E

These islands are those arising from the seafloor as a result of underwater geologic activity, typically volcanic or coralline, that have never been connected to continental land masses.

40|$|In {{this study}} three aspects of sexual {{reproduction}} in Everglades plants were examined to more clearly understand seed dispersal and {{the allocation of}} resources to sexual reproduction— spatial dispersal process, temporal dispersal of seeds (seedbank), and germination patterns in the dominant species, sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense). Community assembly rules for fruit dispersal were deduced by analysis of functional traits associated with this process. Seedbank ecology was investigated by monitoring emergence of germinants from sawgrass soil samples held under varying water depths to determine the fate of dispersed seeds. Fine-scale study of sawgrass fruits yielded information on contributions to variation in sexually produced propagules in this species, which primarily reproduces vegetatively. It was hypothesized that Everglades plants possess a set of functional traits that enhance diaspore dispersal. To test this, 14 traits were evaluated among 51 species by factor analysis. The factorial plot of this analysis generated groups of related traits, with four suites of traits forming dispersal syndromes. <b>Hydrochory</b> traits were categorized by buoyancy and appendages enhancing buoyancy. Anemochory traits were categorized by diaspore size and appendages enhancing air movement. Epizoochory traits were categorized by diaspore size, buoyancy, and appendages allowing for attachment. Endozoochory traits were categorized by diaspore size, buoyancy, and appendages aiding diaspore presentation. These patterns/trends of functional trait organization also represent dispersal community assembly rules. Seeds dispersed by <b>hydrochory</b> were hypothesized to be caught most often in {{the edge of the}} north side of sawgrass patches. Patterns of germination and dispersal mode of all hydrochorous macrophytes with propagules in the seedbank were elucidated by germination analysis from 90 soil samples collected from 10 sawgrass patches. Mean site seed density was 486 seeds/m 2 from 13 species. Most seeds collected at the north side of patches and significantly in the outer one meter of the patch edge (p = 0. 013). Sawgrass seed germination was hypothesized to vary by site, among individual plants, and within different locations of a plant’s infructescence. An analysis of sawgrass fruits with nested ANOVAs found that collection site and interaction of site x individual plant significantly affect germination ability, seed viability, and fruit size (p 3 ̆c 0. 050). Fruit location within a plant’s infructescence did not significantly affect germination. As for allocation of resources to sexual reproduction, only 17. 9...|$|E
40|$|Knowledge of {{propagation}} mechanisms {{is important}} for understanding the invasion ecology and management of invasive plants in order to restore invaded lands. The identification of recruitment pathways {{is one of the}} keys to understanding dispersal mechanisms and determining invasive plant control strategies. The objective of this study was to characterize the recruitment processes of Schinus terebenthifolius, one of the most serious plant invaders in Reunion Island's lowlands. Surprisingly, little attention was given in literature to vegetative propagation by suckering as a dispersal mechanism. Yet, field observations on abandoned farmland and riverbanks combined with germination experiments have shown major differences in recruitment patterns between wet and dry areas. On abandoned dryland farms, seedling emergence is 35 times less than on riverbanks and is replaced by suckering. Birds facilitated seed germination, but their role in seed dispersal (ornithochory) appeared minor and restricted to the formation of satellite invasion foci. Water movement appears to be a more efficient vector than ornithochory because it aids seed transportation (<b>hydrochory),</b> seed germination, and suckering on riverbanks. Control and restoration programs must distinguish the two kinds of recruitment that impact on short- and long-distance dispersal...|$|E
40|$|Water-mediated {{spread of}} seeds (<b>hydrochory)</b> plays an {{important}} role in the dispersal of aquatic plants. In this study we investigate intraspecific variation in floating ability and germination capacity of Sparganium emersum seeds in relation to seed mass, within three natural populations along the Rur River (the Netherlands–Germany). Our results suggest that S. emersum produces two types of seeds: (i) short-floating seeds (SFS) that sink within 4 weeks (approximately 71 % of all seeds), and (ii) long-floating seeds (LFS) that float at least for 6 months (approximately 28 % of all seeds). Our study further shows that short-floating seeds display a significantly higher germination (%) (SFS = 89. 9 % vs LFS = 32. 6 %), a faster germination rate (SFS = 8. 71 ± 3. 3 vs LFS = 9. 32 ± 3. 1 days to germination) and a higher mean seed mass (SFS = 15. 17 ± 4. 5 vs LFS = 11. 25 ± 3. 8 mg), compared to long-floating seeds. It is argued that the production of these two types of seeds by S. emersum plants, each type with a different potential for water-mediated dispersal, represents a bimodal hydrochoric dispersal strategy. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{morphological}} analysis of seeds {{has been an}} important subject in modern ecological studies, once it provides evidence about the biology and adaptations of the parent plant. However, this kind of study has been restricted to the ecology of modern plants and is rarely used in interpretations of Paleozoic data. From the understanding of dispersal syndromes analysis as an important tool to paleoecological reconstruction, this study provides a first approach using this tool with seeds from the Lower Permian strata of southern Paraná Basin in Rio Grande do Sul. Based on previously classified seeds and using their biological and taphonomic data, the syndrome of dispersal was interpreted, and their placement in successional groups (pioneer, early-successional and later-successional) was suggested. Seven morphospecies were analyzed: Samaropsis gigas, representing a later-successional species living in water bodies with <b>hydrochory</b> as its dispersal syndrome; Samaropsis kurtzii, typical of early-successional species showing anemochory as its dispersal syndrome and living in distal areas in relation to water bodies; Samaropsis aff. S. millaniana, Cordaicarpus aff. C. brasilianus, Cordaicarpus cerronegrensis and Cordaicarpus truncata have typical characteristics of pioneer plants, exhibiting barochory as their primary dispersal syndrome with other syndromes associated...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} to summarise present methods used in the research of dispersal river plants. Generally the dispersal {{of all kinds of}} plants which can be dispersed in water corridors, both dispersed in the water column and {{at the bottom of the}} channel. The bachelor thesis is a literatural rewiev. The main part of it is focused on direct methods of research of <b>hydrochory</b> and problems which could arise with individual methods. Each method is suitable for different set of circumstances and it is necessary to know in advance what kind of data we want to obtain. The direct methods includes: catching of the seeds directly from the stream - at one time, but repeatedly, or long term catching by using floating traps. Secondly we can use seed mimics or marked diasporas. The second part is focused on other factors which can influence long-distance plant dispersal in rivers. They include the degree to which are rivers regulated and the fluctuation off water level during years. The paper also includes a part which summarise the evidence on long distance dispersal of river plants. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|E
