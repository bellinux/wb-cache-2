5|$|The Irenaean theodicy is a {{response}} to the evidential problem of evil which raises the problem that, if an omnipotent and omnibenevolent (all-powerful and perfectly loving) God exists, there should be no evil in the world. Evidence of evil <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> make the existence of God improbable. The theodicy attempts to demonstrate that the existence of God remains probable, despite the occurrence of evil.|$|E

25|$|As the {{shipping}} industry prospered {{in the late}} 19th century, some sought to create a trust that would monopolize U.S. shipping companies. However, all negotiations in this regard in the 1890s fell short. The intervention of John Pierpont Morgan, {{one of the richest}} men <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>would</b> change that.|$|E

25|$|Benposta's {{message of}} peace is a prayer against violence, war, poverty, and injustice. It begins, We are {{the youth of}} the earth; we go {{around the world with}} our hands united, and ends with the sentence, If all men <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> pray {{together}} before God, the world would be a star of Peace, Justice and Love.|$|E
25|$|Hawkins was {{determined}} that his navy, as well as having the best fleet of ships <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>would</b> also have the best quality of seamen. He petitioned and won a pay increase for sailors, arguing that {{a smaller number of}} well-motivated and better-paid men would be more effective than a larger group of uninterested men.|$|E
25|$|Brock {{said that}} his former friends in right-wing {{politics}} shunned him because Seduction did not adequately attack the Clintons. Jonah Goldberg of National Review proposed another theory: since “no liberal source <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> talk to Brock,” he could not collect {{the kind of information}} he was after. Goldberg also maintained that while writing the book, Brock had been “seduced” by Sidney Blumenthal, a prominent champion and friend of the Clinton circle. Blumenthal would remain the subject of intense attention from anti-Clintonites two decades later.|$|E

25|$|On the {{transfer}} deadline {{day for the}} new season, 31 August, West Ham seemed to have surprised world football when speculation mounted {{that two of the}} most promising young footballers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> be joining on permanent move. Carlos Tevez announced on his website that he and Javier Mascherano would be joining West Ham from Brazilian club Corinthians. West Ham confirmed shortly afterwards that not only had they signed the two Argentinians, but that they had signed on permanent deals. West Ham reportedly had to beat off competition from some major European clubs to sign the two young players.|$|E

500|$|Wainwright never {{intended}} to impersonate Garland or create a drag act, but rather to inhabit the songs and expose them to a new generation.

The bidders that fell in the top 96 were given the opportunity to be the first public riders on Intimidator on March 27, 2010, before the ride opened to the general public. All money raised during the auction went to the Dale Earnhardt Foundation. The highest bid for a single seat was US$500.|$|E
500|$|Conservative Senator Hugh Segal {{believes}} that Macdonald's true monument is Canada itself: [...] "Without Macdonald we'd be {{a country that}} begins somewhere at the Manitoba-Ontario border that probably goes throughout the east. Newfoundland would be like Alaska and I think that would also go for Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and B.C. We'd be buying our oil from the United States. It would diminish our {{quality of life and}} range of careers, and our role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> have been substantially reduced." [...] Macdonald's biographers note his contribution to establishing Canada as a nation. Swainson suggests that Macdonald's desire for a free and tolerant Canada became part of its national outlook: [...] "He not only helped to create Canada, but contributed immeasurably to its character." [...] Gwyn said of Macdonald, ...|$|E

500|$|In 272 words, {{and three}} minutes, Lincoln {{asserted}} {{the nation was}} born not in 1789, but in 1776, [...] "conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition {{that all men are}} created equal". He defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all. The emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort. He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end as a result of the losses, and the future of democracy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> be assured, that [...] "government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth". Lincoln concluded that the Civil War had a profound objective: a new birth of freedom in the nation.|$|E
500|$|In another temple {{there is}} an {{octagonal}} kiosque, having from the top to the bottom fifteen stories. Each story contains apartments decorated with lacquer in the Cathayan manner, with ante-rooms and verandahs...It is entirely made of polished wood, and this again gilded so admirably {{that it seems to}} be of solid gold. There is a vault below it. An iron shaft fixed {{in the center of the}} kiosque traverses it from bottom to top, and the lower end of this works in an iron plate, whilst the upper end bears on strong supports in the roof of the edifice which contains this pavilion. Thus a person in the vault can with a trifling exertion cause this great kiosque to revolve.

500|$|A notable {{event at}} the Congress was the {{promotion}} of the policy of [...] "peaceful coexistence" [...] by Khrushchev, which officially was a policy to increase East-West collaboration against the threat of nuclear war, but which anti-revisionists believed [...] "was merely a way to divide the world in to spheres of influence inside which each side would enjoy unquestioned supremacy." [...] One anti-revisionist author described Khrushchev's policy as follows: [...] "Khrushchev {{made it clear that he}} was prepared to give up international class struggle, renouncing on behalf of the colonial peoples any right to liberate themselves from oppression and reassuring capitalist governments by emphasising 'peaceful transition to socialism' or the Parliamentary road..." [...] He then quoted Khrushchev as saying that [...] "'if any mad man wanted war, we , the two strongest countries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>would</b> have but to shake our fingers to warn him off.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Futterman {{noted that}} [...] "Rory's a natural to sing Bublé" [...] on [...] "Home" [...] and Chaney said he [...] "sang it nicely enough", but neither {{expressed}} much enthusiasm about the rendition, and Chaney {{gave it a}} [...] "C" [...] grade. Slezak and Lynch were slightly more generous with their matching grades of [...] "C+", but were also unimpressed: Lynch declared it [...] "too schmaltzy for my tastes", and Slezak admitted he doesn't [...] "get" [...] McGinty. The two songs sung by Hiram and LeRoy Berry received little comment, {{in part due to}} their brevity. Chaney was disappointed that [...] "Chapel of Love" [...] was so brief, while Lynch called it [...] "acceptably fun", and similarly approved of [...] "You're the Top", which he called [...] "goofy, lighthearted family fun". Futterman characterized the latter song as [...] "appropriately over-the-top", though Slezak maintained that [...] "no gay dads <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> perform this song with their teenage daughter".|$|E
500|$|Lancaster, however, {{kept an eye}} on {{the public}} {{scrutiny}} surrounding Lopez. Olivier Van Doorne, worldwide creative director at Select Communications, said: [...] "Whenever you take a celebrity into a commercial venture, which {{more and more people are}} doing, there's enormous risk [...] It doesn't take much to turn the public around overnight." [...] Mark Malinowski, director for entertainment marketing at Ketchum, part of the Omnicom, said the situation [...] "will reach a point where, like anything else, there may be overexposure". Lancaster's marketing vice president Catherine Walsh remarked in a statement: [...] "The worst thing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> be to unplug Glow to introduce Still". Still Jennifer Lopez was released in October 2003. While Glow by JLo was aimed at the female market at girls between the age of 15 and 25, Still Jennifer Lopez was aimed to appeal to an older demographic of females 25 and above, according to Rebecca Murray of About.com.|$|E
500|$|... "Whiplash" [...] has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Tim Sendra of Allmusic selected {{it as one}} of the 'track picks' of When the Sun Goes Down, calling it a [...] "stomping jam" [...] and one of the surprises of the album. He stated that the song [...] "adds some welcome weirdness to an otherwise straightforward record." [...] In a positive review, Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post suggested that [...] "Whiplash" [...] was better than at least five songs from Spears's seventh studio album Femme Fatale (2011), saying [...] "what I can't figure out is why <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>would</b> [...] give up this hot track". Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly commented that [...] "the top-shelf collaborators don't hurt — see: the grinding 'Whiplash,' co-penned by one Britney Spears." [...] Scott Shetler of PopCrush gave the song four stars out of five, explaining that it [...] "possesses a hook that will send people running for the dance floor", although [...] "Gomez's vocal is pretty flat [...] but then again, this isn't the kind of song to show off any sort of vocal gymnastics." ...|$|E
