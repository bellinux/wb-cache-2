500|$|The {{episode title}} is a {{reference}} to the television series The Man from U.N.C.L.E. and the town of Jupiter, Florida, which is where Reynolds spent most of his childhood. Sterling proclaims that his career path was largely influenced by Reynolds' film career, particularly his work in the musical film At Long Last Love (1975) and the spy cinema Operation C.I.A. (1965). Reed stated, [...] "Archer says [...] Operation C.I.A. is why [...] became a spy. And [...] like, 'Really, I thought that movie sucked.'" [...] A sequence which features Sterling strapping Reynolds onto a <b>handtruck</b> reflects homage to the thriller film The Silence of the Lambs (1991). The song [...] "East Bound and Down" [...] by Jerry Reed is presented in the episode, while Sterling makes several references to several American cinematic works from the 1970s. Jesse Carp of Cinema Blend wrote: [...] "I should start by saying that this episode played particularly well for me because I’m a huge fan of 1970s American cinema—the good and the bad—so all of those references that Archer soon starts throwing at Reynolds, I'm catching and loving every second of it." [...] "The Man from Jupiter" [...] contains several scenes that are reminiscent to those in the action film Gator (1976). Carp wrote that [...] "it isn't long before the Reynolds' sweet talking and charisma mesmerizes Archer and soon the pair are talking plot possibilities for the last film in the Gator trilogy." ...|$|E
