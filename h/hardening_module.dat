40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} meet the {{development}} demands for high-speed and high-precision of Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine tools, the equipped CNC systems begin to employ the technical route of software hardening. Making full use of the advanced performance of Large Scale Integrated Circuits (LSIC), this paper puts forward using Field Programmable Gates Array (FPGA) for the functional modules of CNC system, which is called Intelligent Software Hardening Chip (ISHC). The CNC system architecture with high performance is constructed based on the open system thought and ISHCs. The corresponding programs can be designed with Very high speed integrate circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL) and downloaded into the FPGA. These <b>hardening</b> <b>modules,</b> including the arithmetic module, contour interpolation module, position control module and so on, demonstrate that the proposed schemes are reasonable and feasibility...|$|R
40|$|This work {{represents}} the collaborative effort between American Air Liquide and Physical Sciences, Inc. {{for developing a}} sensor based on near-IR tunable diode lasers (TDL). The multi-species capability of the sensor for simultaneous monitoring of CO, O 2, and H 2 O concentration as well as gas temperature is ideal for in-situ monitoring on industrial furnaces. The chemical species targeted are fundamental for controlling the combustion space for improved energy efficiency, reduced pollutants, and improved product quality, when coupling the measurement to a combustion control system. Several add-on modules developed provide flexibility in the system configuration for handling different process monitoring applications. For example, the on-Demand Power Control system for the 1. 5 ?m laser is used for high particle density exhaust streams where laser transmission is problematic. For long-distance signal collection a fiber optic communication system is used to reduce noise pick-up. Finally, <b>hardened</b> <b>modules</b> to withstand high ambient temperatures, immune to EMF interference, protection from flying debris, and interfaced with pathlength control laser beam shielding probes were developed specifically for EAF process monitoring. Demonstration of these different system configurations was conducted on Charter Steel's reheat furnace, Imco Recycling, Inc. (now Aleris International, Inc.) aluminum reverberatory furnace, and Gerdau Ameristeel's EAF. Measurements on the reheat furnace demonstrated zone monitoring with the measurement performed close to the steel billet. Results from the aluminum furnace showed the benefit of measuring in-situ near the bath. In this case, low-level furnace optimization was performed and demonstrated 5 % fuel savings. Monitoring tests on the EAF off-gas demonstrated the level of industrialization of the sensor to survive the harsh EAF environment. Long-term testing on the EAF has been on-going for over 6 months with essentially zero maintenance. Validation of the TDL measurement on the EAF was confirmed by comparison with extractive sampling CO measurements...|$|R
40|$|NASA is {{developing}} technologies for {{nuclear electric propulsion}} for proposed deep space missions {{in support of the}} Exploration initiative under Project Prometheus. Electrical power produced by the combination of a fission-based power source and a Brayton power conversion and distribution system is used by a high specific impulse ion propulsion system to propel the spaceship. The ion propulsion system include the thruster, power processor and propellant feed system. A power processor technology development effort was initiated under Project Prometheus to develop high performance and lightweight power-processing technologies suitable for the application. This effort faces multiple challenges including developing radiation <b>hardened</b> power <b>modules</b> and converters with very high power capability and efficiency to minimize the impact on the power conversion and distribution system as well as the heat rejection system. This paper documents the design and test results of the first version of the beam supply, the design of a second version of the beam supply and the design and test results of the ancillary supplies...|$|R
40|$|A panic {{state is}} often caused by {{careless}} computer control. It could be also {{caused by a}} kernel programmer's mistake. It {{can make a big}} problem in computer system when it happens a lot. When a panic occurrs, the process of the panic state has to be checked, then if it can be restored, operating system restores it, but if not, operating system runs the panic function to stop the system in the kernel hardening O. S. To decide recovery of the process, the type of the panic for the present process should be checked. The value type and the address type have to restore the process. If the system process is in a panic state, the system should be designed to shutdown hardening function in the Linux operating system. So it has to decide whether the process should be restored or not before going to the panic state. Key words:Kernel <b>Hardening,</b> Linux, Network <b>Module,</b> ASSERT() macr...|$|R
40|$|A paper {{discusses}} the successful {{development of a}} miniaturized radiation <b>hardened</b> high-voltage switching <b>module</b> operating at 2. 5 kV suitable for space application. The high-voltage architecture was designed, fabricated, and tested using a commercial process that uses a unique combination of 0. 25 micrometer CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) transistors and high-voltage lateral DMOS (diffusion metal oxide semiconductor) device with high breakdown voltage (greater than 650 V). The high-voltage requirements are achieved by stacking a number of DMOS devices within one module, while two modules can be placed in series to achieve higher voltages. Besides the high-voltage requirements, a second generation prototype is currently being developed to provide improved switching capabilities (rise time and fall time for full range of target voltages and currents), the ability to scale the output voltage to a desired value with good accuracy (few percent) up to 10 kV, to cover {{a wide range of}} high-voltage applications. In addition, to ensure miniaturization, long life, and high reliability, the assemblies will require intensive high-voltage electrostatic modeling (optimized E-field distribution throughout the module) to complete the proposed packaging approach and test the applicability of using advanced materials in a space-like environment (temperature and pressure) to help prevent potential arcing and corona due to high field regions. Finally, a single-event effect evaluation would have to be performed and single-event mitigation methods implemented at the design and system level or developed to ensure complete radiation hardness of the module...|$|R
