40|$|Abstract: We {{present an}} {{approach}} for Human Activity Recognition using a compact 2 D spatio-temporal action representation called Action Energy Image (AEI). Our {{hypothesis is that}} the AEI carries useful structure and gross motion <b>information</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>sufficient</b> for activity classification. We construct the Eigen Activity Space by performing PCA on AEIs of various activities and use it for recognition of a test activity sample. The promising results obtained by our method demonstrates the capacity of AEI to discriminate human actions. Our method is robust to anthropometric changes of actors and changes in action speed. It is also invariant to view point changes to a small extent. est...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{measurement}} method of human stature by single view surveillance camera with minimum and sufficient effort of camera calibration. In this method, we calibrate the camera only towards the vertical direction {{to the ground}} by using multiple poles with known length which are placed at the arbitrary positions. Even though the horizontal positions of the poles are unknown, we can obtain the geometrical <b>information</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>sufficient</b> to estimate the vertical length of the human {{according to the length}} of the poles. In the estimation of the human stature, we compute the homography between the plane along with the tips of the poles (pole-top plane) and the ground plane. Using this homography, we can determine any image point that has the same height from the ground, then we can determine the point of the pole length height in the human region. By comparing with the point and the head top point of the human, we can compute the stature with real scale. We have experimentally confirmed that proposed method can be more accurate and easier measurement than the measurement by the traditional camera calibration method using a chess board. ...|$|E
40|$|Pattern {{recognition}} {{methods have}} been successfully applied in several functional neuroimaging studies. These methods {{can be used to}} infer cognitive states, so-called brain decoding. Using such approaches, it is possible to predict the mental state of a subject or a stimulus class by analyzing the spatial distribution of neural responses. In addition it is possible to identify the regions of the brain containing the information that underlies the classification. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) {{is one of the most}} popular methods used to carry out this type of analysis. The aim of the current study is the evaluation of SVM and Maximum uncertainty Linear Discrimination Analysis (MLDA) in extracting the voxels containing discriminative information for the prediction of mental states. The comparison has been carried out using fMRI data from 41 healthy control subjects who participated in two experiments, one involving visual-auditory stimulation and the other based on bimanual fingertapping sequences. The results suggest that MLDA uses significantly more voxels containing discriminative information (related to different experimental conditions) to classify the data. On the other hand, SVM is more parsimonious and uses less voxels to achieve similar classification accuracies. In conclusion, MLDA is mostly focused on extracting all discriminative information available, while SVM extracts the <b>information</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>sufficient</b> for classification.

40|$|This work tackles {{the face}} {{recognition}} task on images captured using thermal camera sensors which can {{operate in the}} non-light environment. While it can greatly increase the scope and benefits of the current security surveillance systems, performing such a task using thermal images is a challenging problem compared to face recognition task in the Visible Light Domain (VLD). This {{is partly due to}} the much smaller amount number of thermal imagery data collected compared to the VLD data. Unfortunately, direct application of the existing very strong face recognition models trained using VLD data into the thermal imagery data will not produce a satisfactory performance. This is due to the existence of the domain gap between the thermal and VLD images. To this end, we propose a Thermal-to-Visible Generative Adversarial Network (TV-GAN) that is able to transform thermal face images into their corresponding VLD images whilst maintaining identity <b>information</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>sufficient</b> enough for the existing VLD face recognition models to perform recognition. Some examples are presented in Figure 1. Unlike the previous methods, our proposed TV-GAN uses an explicit closed-set face recognition loss to regularize the discriminator network training. This information will then be conveyed into the generator network in the forms of gradient loss. In the experiment, we show that by using this additional explicit regularization for the discriminator network, the TV-GAN is able to preserve more identity information when translating a thermal image of a person which is not seen before by the TV-GAN...|$|E

The first algorithm reformulates subqueries to individual databases, the second algorithm extends the first one and reformulates the entire query plan.

40|$|Proprioceptive {{feedback}} from the moving wings of locusts contains <b>information</b> <b>which</b> could <b>be</b> <b>sufficient</b> for {{the control of the}} timing of the wing-muscle contractions. It has been found, however, that at the high frequency of limb movement used in flight this phasic information content is lost in the ganglionic transfer (Wilson & Gettrup, 1963). During rapid running the legs of cockroaches also oscillate at high frequencies, sometimes as rapidly as wing movements of similar-sized animals. It is therefore necessary to know whether the frequency response capabilities of the leg reflexes are similar to or {{different from those of the}} wings in order to understand how the legs are coordinated. If the leg reflexes are limited to the same range as that available to the wing reflexes, then coordination of the legs would necessarily depend upon ganglionic phasing mechanisms; that is, the elementary pattern of leg movements could be due to central nervous control alone, as is true of the locust wing control (Wilson, 1961). However, it can be shown that the phasic leg reflexes are capable of operation at frequencies even greater than those encountered in running. Apparently the significant limitation on rate of leg movement is not nervous but mechanical...|$|R
40|$|Engineering {{datasets}} have {{growing rapidly}} {{in size and}} diversity as data acquisition technology has developed in recent years. However, the full use of the datasets for maximizing machine operation and design has not been investigated systematically because {{of the complexity of}} the datasets and huge amounts of data. This also means that data analysis based on traditional statistic based methods are no longer efficient in obtaining useful knowledge from these datasets. Thus this paper discusses dynamic and static datasets collected from a gearbox test rig with a typical drive system such that the datasets are considered representative for condition monitoring purposes. Dynamic datasets were analyzed to diagnose the condition of the gear: Healthy or Fault, using conventional signal processing techniques such as time-domain and frequency-domain analysis. The static data was also analyzed for comparative evaluation of detection performances. This procedure of data collection and analysis allowed a full understanding to be gained of condition monitoring datasets and paved the way for developing a more effective Data mining approach and efficient database. Moreover, {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} using these new techniques, a prototype database was developed based on a gearbox test system and tested using these methods. The results obtained from a number of conventional methods have shown that data mining can obtain information for condition monitoring efficiently but not so accurately to give fault severity <b>information,</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> often <b>sufficient</b> for making maintenance decisions...|$|R

These results challenge a major assumption of most PMP targeting studies. In addition, we demonstrate that PEX 19, a factor required for peroxisomal membrane biogenesis, interacts with the two minimal targeting regions of PMP 34. Together, these results raise the interesting possibility that PMP import may require novel mechanisms to ensure the solubility of integral PMPs before their insertion in the peroxisome membrane, and that PEX 19 may {{play a central role in}} this process...|$|R

This article reflects on how infographics behave in scientific texts: a way to think about the world through the surface where verbal and visual matrices coexist, unlike products that are typical of line culture. In this case study, the image will no longer be relegated to be a mere illustration of the text. Newspapers are increasingly using infographics as a way to visually broaden scientific knowledge that in some cases the reader needs to refer to the verbal text to understand. As an empiric object for the discussion, two scientific texts from the section Health and Well-being (published on Folha. com, the website of a newspaper with a wide distribution in Brazil) were analyzed.

Two of the flares we discuss are found in ROSAT observations of T Tauri Stars and were obtained between September and October 1991. A flare on the T Tauri Star V 773 Tau was observed by ASCA in September 1995. To this sample we add a Ginga observation of a flare on Algol observed in January 1989. The structure of the X-ray lightcurves observed in this selection of flare events is untypical in that the maximum emission extends over several hours producing a round hump in the lightcurve instead of a sharp peak. We explain this deviation from the standard shape of a flare lightcurve {{as the result of}} a flare erupting on the back side of the star and gradually moving into the line of sight due to the star’s rotation. Making use of the known rotational periods of the stars our model allows to determine the decay timescale of the flares and the size of the X-ray emitting volume according to the standard magnetic loop model.

40|$|Nowadays, {{development}} of e-learning primarily moves towards ensuring wider availability and mobility {{of the contents}} of the courses offered. However, the importance of taking into account personal needs of students in the didactic process, choosing right methods of organisation and conducting courses (<b>which</b> <b>are</b> supposed to increase students' involvement), and finally, integrating courses with accessible sources of information on the Internet is pointed out at the same time. The research objectives in this article are: firstly, to define whether there is a relationship between the level of interest of Polish students majoring in the selected faculties of economic sciences in independent work and their interest in participation in e-learning classes; and secondly, to establish the opinion of the surveyed students about Internet sources of information used by them in the didactic process.

40|$|In Canada, {{microbial}} {{pest control}} products and agents are regulated under the Pest Control Products Act, {{administered by the}} Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) for the Minister of Health. A microbial includes bacteria, algae, fungi, protozoa, viruses, mycoplasmae or rickettsiae and related organisms. Microbial pest control products and agents can include those derived through genetic engineering. When the PMRA was established in 1995, specific directions were given by government to facilitate access to alternatives to traditional chemical products; to support environmental sustainability; and to pursue international cooperation to accelerate registration. Currently in Canada, there are 8 active ingredients and 34 products registered. In 1998, there were 19 research permits and notifications for active ingredients, an increase from 1997. Data requirements are set out in guidelines (Pro 98 - 01 Regulatory Proposal: Guidelines for the registration of microbial pest control agents and products), rather than in regulation. General categories for data requirements for Tier 1 (the set of <b>information</b> <b>which</b> <b>is</b> typically <b>sufficient</b> to allow regulators to determine that a product presents an acceptably low level of risk) include information or data on characterization, health toxicity, environmental toxicity, and efficacy. Pre-submission consultations between registrants and PMRA are encouraged. The main objectives of these consultations are to determine the appropriate study protocols and the subset of data requirements from the guidelines that may be required for the registration of a particular proposed product {{as well as the}} type of information required to support data waivers. Key issues, questions and challenges regarding registration 1. Characterization of the microbial active ingredient is seen as critical and fundamental to the determination of the other data requirements both in environment and in health. The key components are:• identification of the microorganism• relationship to mammalian or other pathogens• toxin producing potential• manufacturing process, including potential for contaminants• physical/technical properties, including storage stability. 2. Building on good information on characterization, for environmental risk assessment, information on host/target range, geographical distribution of host/target, and the geographical distribution of the microbial are key questions. 4. With respect to publicly-funded research groups, {{there is a need for}} links with commercial partners at an appropriate stage in order to love their products into the regulatory System and onto the marketplace. PMRA is working to support the registration and use of microbial products through developing data requirements appropriate to microbiais, working with growers and other stakeholders to support the implementation of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies that include the use of microbials, harmonizing data requirements with both the US and other OECD countries, and ensuring the development of regulations and policies to encourage registration of these products...|$|R
40|$|The {{oral traditions}} of the local Indians are a {{neglected}} major source of data {{on the history of}} Florida. This paper provides an example of one of the types of historical <b>information</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> recoverable, with <b>sufficient</b> patience and care, from the present day Florida Seminole. Non-utilization of the historical {{traditions of the}} pre-white occupants is not a situation unique with the students of Florida's past. It is typical of most areas of the world where Europeans have crowded out non-literate aboriginal peoples, and has been defended with the argument that history transmitted purely orally becomes distorted within a very short time {{to the point of being}} valueless as history (Lowie, 1917). Other students have assumed that such traditions may be relied on completely, where documentary evidence is inadequate or lacking. Neither of these opinions is justified. The reliability of oral tradition varies from culture to culture, depending upon the importance the people place in accurate historical knowledge, and upon other factors in their cultural attitudes and behavior. The factors involved are as yet incompletely known. The reliability of the oral traditions of a group must therefore be assessed by comparing the traditions of specific historical events with documentary data on these same events, in order to decide how much reliance may be placed on traditions of events for which no documentary data exist. Some American Indian tribes, such as the Aztec and others in the Valley of Mexico, preserved remarkably accurate accounts of their own history (Radin, 1920, pp. 3 - 6). Others, for example the Hopi in Arizona, have very little interest in the historical past, and the few traditions they preserve have proved practically worthless as historical * The author is indebted to John M. Goggin for suggesting this as a topic for field investigation among the Seminole, and to Julien C. Yonge for courtesies extende...|$|R
40|$|In general, {{tailings}} dams {{are expected}} to seep. Anomalous seepage, especially when induced by internal erosion, {{is a major concern}} for owners and operators. The long established techniques for monitoring water seepage provide sparse <b>information</b> <b>which</b> may not <b>be</b> <b>sufficient</b> to detect and map the seepage path. Hence, there exists a great need for non-invasive techniques that would be sensitive to changing seepage conditions. The non-invasive nature of the techniques is particularly important because drilling and other penetrating (invasive) investigation methods are normally avoided. Non-invasive techniques such as self-potential and high-resolution resistivity have been significantly improved in the past decade and have been successfully used for water retention dam investigation and monitoring. The main difficulty in the use of these techniques in monitoring sulfide rich tailings dams is the presence of electrochemical potentials that renders the interpretation of the acquired self-potential data difficult. Numerical modelling is one of the latest methods in interpreting self-potential anomalies induced by liquid flow. But, in order to model streaming potentials several parameters need to be measured or estimated; (1) the hydraulic driving force and the hydraulic conductivity are required to solve for the hydraulic pressure distribution; (2) the cross-coupling conductivity distribution is needed to calculate the conduction current source parameter; and (3) the resistivity distribution is needed to determine the resulting potential distribution. The zeta-potential and the resistivity of three pyrite rich tailings from the Abitibi region in Quebec were measured over the pH range 2 to 5 in different KCl aqueous solutions for the purpose of estimating the magnitude of electrokinetic effect induced by mine water seepage and the electrical resistivity variation induced by particle migration. The experimental and theoretical results obtained in the present study are pertinent to the interpretation of self-potential data. The zeta-potential was found to vary from - 27 to - 2 mV and the resistivity of the tailings was found to increase when fine particles are eroded...|$|R
