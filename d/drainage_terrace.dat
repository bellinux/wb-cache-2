40|$|Most vines in the Mediterranean are {{cultivated}} on bare soils, due to {{the scarcity}} of water. In addition, most traditional soil conservation measures have been eliminated to facilitate the movement of machinery in the fields. In such conditions, high erosion rates are recorded. Given the predicted changes in precipitation and {{an increasing number of}} extreme events, an increase in erosion processes is expected. In this study, erosion processes under different climate change scenarios were evaluated as well as the effects of implementing <b>drainage</b> <b>terraces</b> in vineyards. Soil losses were simulated using the WEPP model. The results confirmed the relevance of extreme events on annual soil losses. The WEPP model gave satisfactory results in predicting runoff and soil losses, although the soil losses recorded after some extreme events were under-predicted. The model responded to changes in precipitation and because of that a decrease in precipitation gave rise to a decrease in soil losses. For the scenario in 2050, runoff volumes decreased between 19. 1 and 50. 1 %, while erosion rates decreased between 34 and 56 %. However, the expected increase in rainfall intensity may contribute to higher erosion rates than at present.

40|$|This study assesses {{an array}} of physiochemical soil {{properties}} from a sample of rubber smallholdings managed {{by a group of}} Orang Asli (original people) in northwest Pahang, Peninsular Malaysia. Malaysian smallholders in general face significantly lower productivity levels than the large rubber estates and plantations (Malaysian Rubber Board, 2002). Among smallholders, Orang Asli households generate the lowest rubber yields, earn the lowest non-rubber income, and are most threatened by land scarcity (RISDA, 2003). Furthermore, {{little is known about the}} soils of these smallholdings since most rubber-related soil surveys focus on estates and experiment stations (Pushparajah & Amin, 1977). An understanding of the morphological and physiochemical soil properties of Orang Asli rubber fields is a crucial step toward the efficient allocation of government resources that aim to enhance productivity, promote sustainable agriculture, and improve household welfare. The objectives of this project were to (1) determine the predominant physiochemical characteristics of these soils, (2) evaluate them with an established rubber suitability classification system, (3) group soils according to region, geomorphic position, and estimated soil series in order to make generalizations about soil limitations for certain soil types, and (4) offer methods by which to mitigate the effects of these limitations. We find that there is a great deal of heterogeneity within our sample with regard to both soil type and limitation. The most common physical limitations were related to flooding, uprooting, soil texture, and slope. Almost all soils were severely depleted in organic nutrients and base cations. Overall, these limitations were correctable via <b>drainage,</b> <b>terracing,</b> or establishment of a cover crop.

40|$|In 2008 {{flooding}} {{occurred over}} {{a majority of}} Iowa, damaging homes, displacing residents, and taking lives. In the wake of this event, the Iowa Flood Center (IFC) was charged with the investigation of distributed flood mitigation strategies to reduce the frequency and magnitude of peak flows in Iowa. This dissertation {{is part of the}} several studies developed by the IFC and focused on the application of a coupled physics based modeling platform, to quantify the coupled benefits of distributed flood mitigation strategies on the reduction of peak flows in an agricultural watershed. Additional investigation into tile <b>drainage</b> and <b>terraces,</b> illustrated the hydrologic impact of each commonly applied agricultural practice. The effect of each practice was represented in numerical simulations through a parameter adjustment. Systems were analyzed at the field scale, to estimate representative parameters, and applied at the watershed scale. The impact of distributed flood mitigation wetlands reduced peak flows by 4 % to 17 % at the outlet of a 45 km 2 watershed. Variability in reduction was a product of antecedent soil moisture, 24 -hour design storm total depth, and initial structural storage capacity. The highest peak flow reductions occurred in scenarios with dry soil, empty project storage, and low rainfall depths. Peak flow reductions were estimated to dissipate beyond a total drainage area of 200 km 2, approximately 2 km downstream of the small watershed outlet. A numerical tracer analysis identified the contribution of tile drainage to stream flow (QT/Q) which varied between 6 % and 71 % through an annual cycle. QT/Q responded directly to meteorological forcing. Precipitation driven events produced a strong positive logarithmic correlation between QT/Q and drainage area. The addition of precipitation into the system saturated near surface soils, increased lateral soil water movement, and reduced the contribution of instream tile flow. A negative logarithmic trend in QT/Q to drainage area persisted in non-event durations. Simulated gradient terraces reduced and delayed peak flows in subcatchments of less than 3 km 2 of drainage area. The hydrographs were shifted responding to rainfall later than non-terraced scenarios, while retaining the total volumetric outflow over longer time periods. The effects of dense terrace systems quickly dissipated, and found to be inconsequential at a drainage area of 45 km 2. Beyond the analysis of individual agricultural features, this work assembled a framework to analyze the feature at the field scale for implementation at the watershed scale. It showed large scale simulations reproduce field scale results well. The product of this work was, a systematic hydrologic characterization of distributed flood mitigation structures, pattern tile <b>drainage,</b> and <b>terrace</b> systems facilitating the simulation of each practices in a physically-based coupled surface-subsurface model...|$|R
30|$|The WFIUH {{model is}} a very useful tool for {{evaluating}} ecosystem services related flood risk assessment, runoff abatement, and erosion control, as illustrated in a previous study on the combined effects of <b>drainage</b> density and <b>terrace</b> cultivation in Southern France (Hallema and Moussa, 2014). Here, a greater drainage density resulted in accelerated runoff during storm rainfall, while an increased number of terrace levels along the hillslope diminished the surface gradient, thereby delaying response times and attenuating peak flows (Hallema and Moussa, 2014). These results {{are in line with}} observations in many {{other parts of the world}} (Di Lazzaro et al., 2015; Wei et al., 2016). For example, Kovář et al. (2016) found similar effects of agricultural terraces on storm runoff on a similar-sized hillslope in Bohemia (Czech Republic); however, they used the kinematic wave approximation to route storm flow because of lower rainfall intensities and a possibly greater relative contribution from subsurface flow compared to Mediterranean and semi-arid watersheds.|$|R

A web-based conservation planning tool for terrace layouts was created by modifying a terrace location program (TERLOC), developed originally by Sudduth and Gregory (1982) and revised by Ghidey et al. (1992). Development of a terrace system is complicated by the time-intensive manual layout process, which can take up to 50 % of the total design time. TERLOC is a conservation planning tool designed to locate terrace layouts using digital elevation data and minimal user input. arcgis enables users to automate the terrace layout procedure, potentially saving time and money in the terrace design process. Program availability and ease of use was greatly enhanced by integrating TERLOC to a web-based ArcGIS interface. Existing design procedures were modified to accommodate fields with irregular boundaries, topography, and orientation. Additional design options were also included to select a best layout design: variable terrace spacing, non-erosive channel grade, underground and interconnecting outlet selection, and the option for multiple key terraces. Analysis of the program was performed by comparing the program layout results to manually located terraces. The program and manual terrace layout results were found to be similar, especially for fields with large <b>drainage</b> areas. <b>Terrace</b> spacing was found to differ the most, with the program spacing typically larger than the manual result. Finally, the software quality of TERLOC was analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively.

5000|$|As {{noted by}} Baron Eduard V. Toll {{in his account}} of the New Siberian Islands, sizable and {{economically}} significant accumulations of fossil ivory occur within them. The ivory, along with mammoth and other bones, are found in recent beaches, <b>drainage</b> areas, river <b>terraces</b> and river beds. The New Siberian Islands are unique in the burial and preservation of fossil ivory [...] "...in such a wonderful state of preservation that the tusks so found cannot be distinguished from the very best and purest ivory." [...] The abundant bones, even skeletons, of mammoth, rhinoceros, musk-ox, and other megafauna along with the mammoth ivory found in these islands are preserved by permafrost, in which they are encased. The permafrost periodically developed in Late Pleistocene loess, solifluction, pond, and stream sediments as they accumulated. The radiocarbon dating of bones, ivory, and plants; optically stimulated luminescence dating of enclosing sediments; and uranium-thorium dating of associated peats demonstrate that the bones and ivory, which are found within some of the New Siberian Islands, accumulated over a period of some 200,000 years. Radiocarbon dates obtained from the collagen of 87 mammoth tusks and bones collected from Faddeevsky, Kotelniy, and New Siberia islands ranged from 9470±40 BP to greater than 50,000 BP (14C).

40|$|With {{increasing}} pressure on farmers {{to improve the}} performance of their cropping systems, there is a growing need to design cropping systems that respond concurrently to environmental, agronomic and socioeconomic constraints. However, the trade-offs between ecosystem services, including provisioning services, can vary considerably from plot to plot. Using a typology of agricultural practices to adapt a conceptual model of the cropping system can provide an instrument to support the design of cropping systems that take into account the diversity of environmental and socioeconomic conditions and trade-offs within a study site. This method was tested to design coffee-based agroforestry systems mitigating soil erosion in central Costa Rica, a case study with a high-value crop in a complex relationship to its biophysical environment. A generic plot-scale conceptual model representing the effect of agricultural practices and environmental factors was designed, with erosion reduction, coffee production and gross margin as the outputs. Quantitative data on agricultural practices and costs were then collected over two years on a sample of plots in an 18 km 2 watershed upstream of a hydroelectric dam. A typology of these plots was built based on agricultural management practices; the resulting groups were further characterized by socioeconomic and environmental variables. The critical variables from each group of plots were used to adapt the conceptual model to the groups from the typology. The four groups found were (1) lowintensity management; (2) intensive management; (3) shaded agroecosystem, and (4) intensive agrochemical management. The conceptual model helped analyze the key processes and trade-offs for each group and helped make recommendations of adapted erosion control practices. The model showed that for some groups, less time-consuming erosion control actions not impacting coffee production might be more suitable, such as <b>drainage</b> canals, <b>terraces,</b> and vegetative barriers. In contrast, other groups had better socioeconomic or environmental conditions that opened the possibility of using shade trees or manual weed control (as opposed to herbicide use) to control erosion. This method finds its application in the plot-scale design and prototyping of agricultural systems that better respond to specific constraints, and can provide more relevant basis for discussion with farmers in participative methods. It also presents the advantage of requiring little data acquisition, although it can be further developed through integrating numerical relationships for quantitative modeling.

40|$|Dramatic {{changes in}} land use were {{associated}} with the rise of agriculture in the mid Holocene in the Mediterranean region. Both the surface properties and the drainage networks were changed. Along with the direct modifications to surface properties (vegetation removal and change, sediment liberation and compaction) and consequent <b>drainage</b> alteration (<b>terracing,</b> canals), up and downstream responses in the watersheds communicated these changes throughout the landscape. The magnitude, rate, and feedbacks with the growing human populations are critical questions in our effort to assess human-landscape interactions. To investigate these relationships, recent field work in the Penaguila Valley in southeast Spain included landform mapping, alluvial deposit description, and sample collection emphasizing areas of active erosion, remnant land surfaces and their relation to archaeological sites. We have updated our geomorphic maps by refining the delineation of alluvial terraces, steep-walled (40 m deep) drainages ("barrancos"), and hollows ("barrancos de fondo plano"). Hollows are curved, elongate, flat-bottomed gullies with steep walls (2 - 30 m tall) and extend headward from the main barrancos. This work enables more accurate terrace correlations necessary for both landscape evolution modeling and interpretation of the development history of the basin. Alluvial terraces are crucial to this research because they record periods of past stable topography. In the Penaguila, sites dating back to late Mesolithic and early Neolithic (around 6600 BP) and subsequent periods (Chalcolithic and Bronze Age) are exposed on a prominent terrace surface mapped as Terrace A. This broad low relief surface is scarred by deep barrancos and hollow formation that expose bedrock marls and overlying alluvial deposits. Stratigraphic profiles and texture analyses of Terrace A deposits reveal overland flow facies and channel networks in reworked and CaCO 3 -encrusted marls, and several organic-rich paleosols. Small remnant surfaces mapped as Terrace Z (below Terrace A) were observed within the main barrancos and indicate a later, brief accumulation period with subsequent incision to the modern channel. Holocene landscape development in the Penaguila appears to have progressed from a period of stability to slope denudation with aggradation (stream infilling) followed by rapid incision which initiated sometime near the time of occupation. This change from a low relief alluvial surface to one cut by narrow channels may have been an important shift for local populations. Their response to that environmental modification may be associated with the horticulturalist to agricultural intensification noted in the archaeological record. Tighter chronology and better understanding of the driving processes for barranco incision and hollow formation will improve our ability to correlate the changing landscape with land use practices. Such an improved correlation leads to better understanding of human-landscape interactions. Conference Poste...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Cerro Goden {{fault zone}} is {{associated}} with a curvilinear, continuous, and prominent topographic lineament in western Puerto Rico. The fault varies in strike from northwest to west. In its westernmost section, the fault is ~ 500 m south of an abrupt, curvilinear mountain front separating the 270 - to 361 -m-high La Cadena de San Francisco range from the Rio Añasco alluvial valley. The Quaternary fault of the Añasco Valley is in alignment with the bedrock fault mapped by D. McIntyre (1971) in the Central La Plata quadrangle sheet east of Añasco Valley. Previous workers have postulated that the Cerro Goden fault zone continues southeast from the Añasco Valley and merges with the Great Southern Puerto Rico fault zone of south-central Puerto Rico. West of the Añasco Valley, the fault continues offshore into the Mona Passage (Caribbean Sea) where it is characterized by offsets of seafl oor sediments estimated to be of late Quaternary age. Using both 1 : 18, 500 scale air photographs taken in 1936 and 1 : 40, 000 scale photographs taken by the U. S. Department of Agriculture in 1986, we identifi ed geomorphic features suggestive of Quaternary fault movement in the Añasco Valley, including aligned and defl ected <b>drainages,</b> apparently offset <b>terrace</b> risers, and mountain-facing scarps. Many of these features suggest right-lateral displacement. Mapping of Paleogene bedrock units in the uplifted La Cadena range adjacent to the Cerro Goden fault zone reveals the main tectonic events that have culminated in late Quaternary normal-oblique displacement across the Cerro Goden fault. Cretaceous to Eocene rocks of the La Cadena range exhibit large folds with wavelengths of several kms. The orientation of folds and analysis of fault striations within the folds indicate that the folds formed by northeast-southwest shortening in present-day geographic coordinates. The age of deformation is well constrained as late Eocene–early Oligocene by an angular unconformity separating folded, deep-marine middle Eocene rocks from transgressive, shallow-marine rocks of middle-upper Oligocene age. Rocks of middle Oligocene–early Pliocene age above unconformity are gently folded about the roughly last-west–trending Puerto Rico–Virgin Islands arch, which is well expressed in the geomorphology of western Puerto Rico. Arching appears ongoing because onshore and offshore late Quaternary oblique-slip faults closely parallel the complexly deformed crest of the arch and appear to be related to extensional strains focused in the crest of the arch. We estimate ~ 4 km of vertical throw on the Cerro Goden fault based on the position of the carbonate cap north of the fault in the La Cadena de San Francisco and its position south of the fault inferred from seismic refl ection data in Mayaguez Bay. Based on these observations, our interpretation of the kinematics and history of the Cerro Goden fault zone includes two major phases of motion: (1) Eocene northeast-southwest shortening possibly accompanied by leftlateral shearing as determined by previous workers on the Great Southern Puerto Rico fault zone; and (2) post–early Pliocene regional arching of Puerto Rico accompanied by normal offset and right-lateral shear along faults fl anking the crest of the arch. The second phase of deformation accompanied east-west opening of the Mona rift and is inferred to continue to the present day...|$|R
