5|$|Many {{residential}} PV {{systems are}} connected to the grid wherever available, especially in developed countries with large markets. In these grid-connected PV systems, use of energy storage <b>is</b> <b>optional.</b> In certain applications such as satellites, lighthouses, or in developing countries, batteries or additional power generators are often added as back-ups. Such stand-alone power systems permit operations at night and at other times of limited sunlight.|$|E
5|$|The general {{drivability}} test {{is performed}} by trotter stallions. It <b>is</b> <b>optional</b> for draught type horses {{in lieu of}} the pulling test, and for pony-sized horses {{in lieu of the}} rideability test. The horse is driven by two different members of the studbook evaluation committee during this test, and asked to perform at a walk and trot. Its cooperation and disposition are evaluated on a scale of 4 to 10 points.|$|E
5|$|A {{ski flying}} event {{consists}} of several preliminary stages, {{culminating in a}} competition to decide a winner and subsequent order. Within an event there are up to three competitions – individual, and sometimes team – all taking place on separate days. These competitions are contested somewhat differently depending on whether an event is staged {{as part of the}} Ski Flying World Championships or Ski Flying World Cup. In both events, a 'training' round takes place on the opening day, as well as a 'trial' round before each competition; these non-scoring rounds are essentially practice or warm-up sessions, and athlete participation <b>is</b> <b>optional.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{standard}} {{engine was}} a 429 cubic-inch V8 {{equipped with a}} two-barrel carburetor. The four-barrel 429 from the Marauder <b>was</b> <b>optional.</b> The sole transmission for the Marquis (and all full-size Lincolns and Mercurys of the period) was the Ford C6 3-speed automatic. Power front disc brakes <b>were</b> <b>optional.</b> [...] During 1972, the 460 cubic inch V-8 <b>was</b> made <b>optional.</b>|$|R

5|$|It is a one-wire {{bidirectional}} {{serial bus}} {{that is based}} on the CENELEC standard AV.link protocol to perform remote control functions. CEC wiring is mandatory, although implementation of CEC in a product <b>is</b> <b>optional.</b> It was defined in HDMI Specification 1.0 and updated in HDMI 1.2, HDMI 1.2a and HDMI 1.3a (which added timer and audio commands to the bus). USB to CEC adapters exist that allow a computer to control CEC-enabled devices.|$|E
5|$|On 12 January 2016, Alton Towers {{announced}} that Air would be re-themed as Galactica for the 2016 season and would include on-ride virtual reality headsets simulating a {{ride through the}} cosmos. The announcement was made at an event held at the Science Museum. Each seat on the roller coaster is fitted with a Samsung Gear VR headset and pouch. The virtual reality experience <b>is</b> <b>optional,</b> as guests can choose to ride without using the headsets. A promotional website was also released explaining {{more information about the}} ride and its new storyline. In late February 2016, the park {{announced that}} the official opening date would be 24 March 2016.|$|E
5|$|To ensure {{baseline}} compatibility {{between different}} HDMI sources and displays (as well as backward compatibility with the electrically compatible DVI standard) all HDMI devices must implement the sRGB color space at 8 bits per component. Ability {{to use the}} YCbCr color space and higher color depths ("deep color") <b>is</b> <b>optional.</b> HDMI permits sRGB 4:4:4 chroma subsampling (8–16 bits per component), xvYCC 4:4:4 chroma subsampling (8–16 bits per component), YCbCr 4:4:4 chroma subsampling (8–16 bits per component), or YCbCr 4:2:2 chroma subsampling (8–12 bits per component). The color spaces {{that can be used}} by HDMI are ITU-R BT.601, ITU-R BT.709-5 and IEC 61966-2-4.|$|E

5|$|The {{system uses}} eight {{lettered}} zones which are divided by major state highways. Each county {{road in the}} system is designated with the zone letter followed by a number. Six of the zones, A–F, are in the Lower Peninsula while the Upper Peninsula is divided into the remaining two, G and H. There have been a total of 66different highways designated in seven of the zones; as of 2015 no E highways have been named. Participation by the county road commissions <b>is</b> <b>optional,</b> and not all counties use the system. One additional highway, H-16, has appeared on state maps since the 1980s {{although it is not}} a part of the system. Of the highways designated, two were removed from the system and later partially restored.|$|E
5|$|To furnish a {{functional}} oligonucleotide, all the protecting groups {{have to be}} removed. The N-acyl base protection and the 2-cyanoethyl phosphate protection may be, and is often removed simultaneously by treatment with inorganic bases or amines. However, the applicability of this method {{is limited by the}} fact that the cleavage of 2-cyanoethyl phosphate protection gives rise to acrylonitrile as a side product. Under the strong basic conditions required for the removal of N-acyl protection, acrylonitrile is capable of alkylation of nucleic bases, primarily, at the N3-position of thymine and uracil residues to give the respective N3-(2-cyanoethyl) adducts via Michael reaction. The formation of these side products may be avoided by treating the solid support-bound oligonucleotides with solutions of bases in an organic solvent, for instance, with 50% triethylamine in acetonitrile or 10% diethylamine in acetonitrile. This treatment is strongly recommended for medium- and large scale preparations and <b>is</b> <b>optional</b> for syntheses on small scale where the concentration of acrylonitrile generated in the deprotection mixture is low.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{completion}} of the first seven years of primary education, students can continue their studies in lower secondary education in the 8th and 9th grade and if they wish to, they can also take the 10th year of Fólkaskúli. Two thirds of the pupils from the 9th grade chose to take the 10th grade of Fólkaskúlin also. Lower secondary education lasts {{two to three years}} and, as with primary education, it is provided by Fólkaskúli and is free of charge. The first two years are part of the compulsory education, while the third year <b>is</b> <b>optional,</b> though a prerequisite to continue to the upper high school. In 2014 there were 1,932 students in lower secondary education.|$|E

5|$|Formal end-of-year {{examinations}} commence {{starting in}} Year 4 to dictate class streaming {{arrangements for the}} following year. Students are examined in English, Maltese, mathematics, religion and social studies. Despite the fact that eleven-plus examinations highlight inequality and failures, and are recognized as ineffective educational tools by experts, Malta still implements such exams. In Year 6, when most pupils have turned eleven years of age, an eleven-plus exam is given to students to determine which students attend which secondary schools. Students are tested in English language, Maltese language, mathematics, social studies and religion; the latter <b>is</b> <b>optional</b> for those not adhering to the faith taught in schools. While 73 per cent of eleven-year-old students sat the eleven-plus exam in 2001, only about 54 percent pass it each year. Students achieving success in the eleven-plus exam go on to attend prestigious 'junior lyceums' during their secondary years, whilst {{those who do not}} attend 'area secondary schools'. This is similar to the operation of the Tripartite System in the United Kingdom following World War II.|$|E
5|$|Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games is a {{collection}} of twenty-four events based on the Olympic Games. On the Wii, the events consist of using the motion sensor capabilities of the Wii Remote and Nunchuk attachment to control the actions of the on-screen character. The player moves the remote {{in a manner similar to}} the method the separate games are played in real life; for example, swinging the Wii Remote to replicate hammer throw or pulling back the remote and tilting the Nunchuk like a bow and arrow. While the Nunchuck is required for archery, it <b>is</b> <b>optional</b> for most of the events. There are also events that are more physically demanding, such as the five running events which require rapid drumming of the controller. Some aspects of the gameplay are computer controlled. For example, in table tennis the player movement is controlled by the Wii, while the swinging of the racket is controlled by the player. The DS game is the same in design, but due to lack of motion controls, its events are much less physically demanding than those on the Wii. For example, instead of drumming the controller, players have to quickly stroke the touchscreen.|$|E
5|$|Zack {{had only}} a small role in the {{original}} Final Fantasy VII. He is first mentioned by name in Gongaga, his hometown, where his parents are oblivious as to what became of him after he left to join SOLDIER, and are worried for his safety after not hearing from him for years. It {{is at this point}} that Aerith explains Zack was her first love. Cloud later realizes that some of his memories and even aspects of his personality were actually Zack's, and not his own. Flashbacks reveal that both Zack and Cloud battled Sephiroth after he burned the town of Nibelheim upon discovering he {{was the result of a}} scientific experiment. After Cloud defeated Sephiroth, both Zack and Cloud were taken to be used in experiments by Shinra. Eventually, Zack woke up and was able to escape with a semi-conscious Cloud to the city Midgar, but on the edge of the city, he was gunned down by Shinra troops. While Zack's and Cloud's flashback escape <b>is</b> <b>optional</b> in the North American and European releases of Final Fantasy VII and the Japanese International version, it was originally planned to be shown once Cloud discovered the results of Shinra's experiments.|$|E
