Male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were fed a purified diet (control), diets containing cholesterol (0. 12 g/ 100 g) only, or in combination with either plant sterols or stanols (0. 5 g/ 100 g) for 4 wk. Plant sterols and stanols dramatically increased neutral fecal sterol excretion (2. 2 and 1. 4 -fold, respectively, compared with cholesterol-fed mice; P < 0. 05). Cholesterol and cholesterol ester concentrations were higher in livers of mice fed cholesterol compared with controls (+ 135 % and + 925 %; P < 0. 05).

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC) is the {{immediate}} precursor of ethylene, which is derived from C- 2 and C- 3 of ACC. When [1 - 14 C]ACC was administered to etiolated mungbean (Vigna radiata) hypocotyls, ≈ 16 % of the ACC was converted to ethylene and about 10 % of the radioactivity was converted to [14 C]asparagine in 7 hr. In etiolated epicotyls of common vetch (Vicia sativa), after 7 hr about 14 % of the ACC was converted to ethylene and 16 % of the radioactivity was converted to β-cyanoalanine plus γ-glutamyl-β-cyanoalanine. Itis known that in most plants cyanide is metabolized to asparagine via the intermediate β-cyanoalanine, whereas in a fewplants such as V. sativa, β-cyanoalanine is converted to the conjugate γ-glutamyl-β-cyanoalanine. We confirmed that [14 C]cyanide was metabolized into [14 C]asparagine in mungbean and into [14 C]cyanoalanine plus its conjugate in V. sativa. Moreover, after <b>feeding</b> <b>plant</b> tissue with [1 - 14 C]ACC, [14 C]asparagine isolated from mungbean and β-[14 C]cyanoalanine from V. sativa were labeled in the C- 4 position, as would be expected if these two compounds were derived from [14 C]cyanide. When the conversion of ACC to ethylene in V. sativa tissue was inhibited by high temperature (41 °C), the conversion of [1 - 14 C]ACC to β-[14 C]cyanoalanine and γ-glutamyl-β-[14 C]cyanoalanine was similarly inhibited. When [carboxyl- 14 C]ACC was administered to mungbean and V. sativa, 14 CO 2 was recovered in an amount equivalent to the amount of ethylene produced.

40|$|By {{selectively}} removing functional {{groups from}} biomass derived carbohydrates, valuable platform chemicals {{can be generated}} from renewable sources. Through dehydration chemistry glucose can be upgraded into 5 -(Hydroxymethyl) - 2 -furfuraldehyde (HMF) and levulinic acid. Iron (III) chloride hexahydrate has shown moderate activity to transform glucose into HMF and has also shown high yields and selectivity {{for the production of}} levulinic acid. Typically synthesized from acidic solutions made with mineral acids, levulinic acid has now been produced in high yields with a metal salt. The difference between maximizing production for HMF or levulinic acid from the same catalyst relies on the control of the reaction conditions. By using microwave irradiation, improved collisions and stabilized transition states allow for selective production of desired products while eliminating undesired reaction pathways. ^ Understanding the improvement of biomass carbohydrates also requires understanding how they are incorporated into the plant structures. By utilizing fluorescent tagging strategies a two part marking system was used to follow the incorporation of fucose into the plant cell wall. Fucose is limited in its use by plants only becoming incorporated into branched xylan chains that help to link cellulose and hemicellulose together. The synthesis of xylan in the plant Golgi also utilizes extracellular sugar. By <b>feeding</b> <b>plant</b> cells a specially designed azido tagged sugar it should become incorporated into the cell wall. On its own, the azido tagged sugar has very little fluorescent properties; however the attached azide group becomes important for click reactions. Click reactions involve two small functional groups that selectively combine. In this case the azide is clicked to an alkyne group to form a triazole. The alkyne group is part of a naphthalimide compound that has strong fluorescent properties due to its aromatic structure. By adding a triazole to the fluorescent naphthalimide complex, a much stronger fluorescent signal can be generated. By reproducing this strategy with plant cells it was hoped that the strong fluorescent signals could be imaged after their incorporation into plants. However issues with reproducibility of fluorescent emission spectrum and only two-fold intensity differences rather than the desired order of magnitude difference proved to be experimentally challenging. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} PhD Thesis was {{to study}} the species {{spectrum}} of the chrysomelid genus Oulema in Brno environment. On observed fields the following species of the genus Oulema were found: O. melanopus, O. rufocyanea and O. gallaeciana. O. rufocyanea was recorded from in field conditions in the Czech Republic for the first time. The most numerous was O. gallaeciana, followed by O. melanopus and O. rufocyanea. The sex ratio was in favour of males, only in one case the sex ratio was equal. The beginning of insect invasion into the growths of winter wheat corresponded to TS 6 = 110 oC. The maximum occurence of Oulema-species was included in TS 6 = 149 - 250 oC. This results show that in optimal weather conditions the maximal abundance can occur earlier than is cited in the literature (TS 6 = 200 - 250 oC). On the contrary, the limit TS 6 = 400 oC for monitoring of larvae was verified. The occurence of each species of the genus Oulema was evaluated by means of analysis of variance, while the Tukey {{test was used to}} asses group homogenity. The statistically significant difference (p < 0, 01) were proved for <b>feeding</b> <b>plant,</b> species of leaf beetles and the date of sweeping and next for all interactions. Only the interaction of species of leaf beetle x the date of sweeping, was found significantly different (p < 0, 05). During the three years period the females of O. melanopus with mature eggs were observed in winter wheat for 16 to 48 days, the females of O. gallaeciana for 40 to 52 days and the females of O. rufocyanea for 14 - 23 days. The same characteristics were observed in the growths of spring barley - the females of O. melanopus for 21 to 37 days, the females of O. gallaeciana for 30 to 47 days and the females of O. rufocyanea for 1 - 25 days. In the first sampling event which corresponded with the first infestation of Oulema species in winter wheat, the females with mature eggs were not found. On the other hand, in growths of spring barley, where the sampling started at the beginning of shotting stage, the females were in the third and the fourth stages of oogenesis. Distinguishing O. melanopus and O. rufocyanea according to external morphological characteristics is considered as uncertain. Totally 469 specimens of O. melanopus and 114 specimens of O. rufocyanea were measured. The ratio of some characteristics was studied: ratio of body length to elytra length, ratio of body length to pronotum length, ratio of elytra length to elytra width, ratio of body length to length of antennae, ratio of pronotum length to pronotum width and ratio of the second to the third antennomeres. Only the ratio of body length to length of antennae and the ratio of the second to the third antennomeres were found to be statistically significantly differenct for both sexes.

The optimum point is on a pH value of about 6, exchange acidity y 1 1, and exchangeable calcium 10 m. e. / 100 gm. As the pH value and calcium content of the soil surpass the optimum point, The plant grows less actively, but its normal growth can be seen till on the alkaline soil such as pH 8. 06, exchange acidity y 1 trace, exchangeable calcium 23 m. e. / 100 gm. (Table 1) The percentage of calcium contained in the plant becomes higher with increasing rate of liming. Thus content of calcium in the airial part of the plant ranges from 0. 3 ％ at pH 4. 6, exchange acidity y 1 37 exchangeable calcium 1 m. e. / 100 gm. to 0. 6 ％ at pH 8. 06, exchange acidity y 1 trace, exchangeable Ca 23 m. e. / 100 gm. and as a whole, it settles at the point of an average 0. 5 ％ (Table 4) On the other hand the amount of phosphorus in the plant is less affected by the addition of CaCO 3 than in the case of calcium and nitrogen, and the percentage of phosphorus in the plant is very low when compared with that of calcium which is given in table 4. The average value of the former is 0. 02 ％. The content of crude protein is increased by the application of the fertilizer, and also by the addition of lime, proportional to the increasing amount of the latter. But liming the soil of pH above 8. 01, causes decrease in the crude protein content of the plant. From the results obtained through these studies it is considered that this plant does not need much Ca and P elements, so that it could flourish on reclaimed land lacking in Ca and P elements. The Crab-grass seems to have a very remarkable degree of adaptability to the Ca content in the soil, so that it could widly distribute over the strong acid soil and lime-stone regions. These studies will give a suggestion {{on the use of the}} Crab-grass as forage plants. メヒシバの生態分布の機構及び其の飼料価値を追究する目的で, 無肥料又は施肥状態に於ける石灰加用のメヒシバ体成分に及ぼす影響につき研究した. メヒシバは適量の肥料分があると, 強酸性で置換石灰の極めて少い土壌（pH 4. 5 ～ 6. 5 置換酸度y 1 37, 置換石灰 1. 7 m. e. / 100 gm. ）に於てもよく繁茂する. そして生育の最適点は pH 6, 置換酸度 y 1 1, 置換石灰 10 m. e. / 100 gm. である. それ以上 pH 値が上昇すると幾分生長が落ちるが, pH 8. 06, 置換酸度 y 1 trace, 置換石灰 23 m. e. / 100 gm. に於ても正常に繁茂する. メヒシバ地上部のカルシウム含量は CaCO 3 の添加量の増加と共に上昇する. 即ちカルシウム含量は pH 約 4. 6, 置換酸度 y 1 37, 置換石灰 1. 7 m. e. / 100 mg. で約 0. 3 %, pH 8. 06, 置換酸度 y 1 trace, 置換石灰 23 m. e. / 100 mg. で 0. 6 ％, 平均約 0. 5 ％である（Table 4 ）. 一方燐の含量は石灰作用の影響が少く, その含量もカルシウムに比して極めて少くて平均約 0. 02 ％にすぎない. 粗蛋白質の含量は適量の施肥及び石灰の加用によつて増加する. しかし pH 8. 01 以上に石灰を加えると粗蛋白質の量は却つて減少する. 以上の結果によつて見るに, メヒシバは石灰及び燐の要求度が少く, 土壌の酸度に対する抵抗力が強いことがメヒシバをして強酸性で, しかも燐成分に乏しい開墾地に跋扈させる所以である. 又土壌中の石灰含量に対する適応力が大きい事が本種が強酸性土壌から石灰岩地帯にかけて広く分布する一つの原因である. 尚本研究による結果は, メヒシバを飼料として利用する際にも役立つであろう...|$|E
