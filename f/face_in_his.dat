25|$|While Polish {{commentators}} saw Putin's {{participation in}} the ceremony held on April 7 as a symbolic gesture, they were touched when Putin and Tusk paid tribute and laid flowers {{at the site of}} the crash. Tusk knelt and briefly hid his <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands, then stood up as Putin patted him on the shoulder. The two hugged, then gave a joint press conference on the investigation into the crash. Polish commentators noted this was a human gesture, and a display of emotion that Poles had longed to see from their eastern neighbours.|$|E
25|$|After this incident, Kirtikar's {{reports were}} {{probably}} screened by Savarkar {{before they were}} passed on to Scotland Yard. M.P.T. Acharya was at this time instructed by Aiyar and Savarkar to set himself up as an informer to Scotland Yard; they believed this would provide information {{to the police and}} help corroborate the reports sent by Kirtikar. Although it pursued Indian students and shadowed them closely, Scotland Yard was severely criticised for its inability to penetrate the organisation. The Viceroy's secretary, William Lee-Warner, was assaulted twice in London: he was slapped in the <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> office by a young Bengali student named Kunjalal Bhattacharji and assaulted in a London park by another Indian student. The Yard's inefficiency was blamed for these events.|$|E

500|$|Gary Berkowitz, a {{programmer}} from Billboard, {{predicted that the}} song's sound would appeal to the Top 40 crowd, and similarly, author Martin Charles Strong {{described it as a}} destined hit. AllMusic's William Cooper took a liking to [...] "Digging Your Scene" [...] for being engaging, while Keith Tuber, a columnist for Orange Coast, felt it stood out on Animal Magic before calling it a [...] "good [...] quirky '60s-English-invasion-sounding song".

500|$|A month {{prior to}} the 1980 {{eruption}} of Mount St. Helens, Voight was contacted by Rocky Crandell, a United States Geological Survey (USGS) employee working in the Vancouver office near the mountain. Crandell sought Voight's expertise in landslides, hoping Voight would opine on a growing bulge, [...] long, which had emerged on the mountain's north <b>face.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> reporting to Crandell and his associates, Voight said that the bulge could fail and collapse the volcano's entire north sector. He suggested they begin monitoring the rate of movement of the bulge, worried that the collapse could trigger an eruption. He also advised hiring a local surveyor to take measurements, offending several of the geologists. Shortly after, Voight left the mountain and returned to teaching classes at Penn State. Before the eruption, he had sent his full report to the USGS, summarizing his predictions, depicting {{the failure of the}} bulge and the collapse of the mountain's north side followed by a violent eruption. After a magnitude 5.1 earthquake centered directly below the north slope caused that part of the volcano to slide, Mount St. Helens erupted, causing $1.1 billion in damage and killing 57 people.|$|E

500|$|To his left, in the center, are the [...] "traitors", {{many of them}} on the Russian payroll, {{and future}} members of the Targowica Confederation. Adam Poniński, marshal of the Sejm, {{pointing}} in red court dress, either demands that Rejtan leaves or points to the armed Russian guards outside the door; he holds a simple wooden walking stick instead of a [...] more elaborate marshall's staff, which Rejtan stole a day earlier. Behind him are bishop Ignacy Massalski and Prince Antoni Stanisław Czetwertyński-Światopełk. To his right, Hetman Franciszek Ksawery Branicki hides his <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hands; which likely was Matejko's solution for a prosaic problem — he probably did not have access to a likeness of Branicki. Szczęsny Potocki, with the blue sash, looks to the ground, embarrassed. Behind the overturned chair, his father, Franciszek Salezy Potocki, also embarrassed, drops a quill pen and looks away. Between the two Potockis Jacek Małachowski is engaged in discussion with Samuel Korsak, while Karol Radziwiłł simply observes the situation, amused. On the ground, turned over, lies an amchair, with Branicki's hat and a coin purse, from which the coins spill towards Poniński, alluding to the real reason he is intent on concluding the debate.|$|E
500|$|Monotype Bembo {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous revivals of the Aldine {{typeface}} of 1495. It was created under the influence of Monotype executive and printing historian Stanley Morison by the design team at the Monotype factory in Salfords, Surrey, south of London. While most printers of the Arts and Crafts movement of the previous sixty years had been more interested in the slightly earlier typefaces of Nicolas Jenson, Morison greatly admired Aldus Manutius' typeface above others of the period. The main reasons for his admiration were the balance of the letter construction, such as the evenness of the 'e' with a level cross-stroke and the way the capitals were made slightly lower than the ascenders of the tallest lower-case letters. He described the Aldine roman as [...] "inspired not by writing, but by engraving; not script but sculpture." [...] His friend printer Giovanni Mardersteig similarly suggested the appeal of the Aldine <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> commentary that [...] "Griffo...rid himself of the influence of the characteristic round forms of letters written with a pen; he developed instead a more narrow and it might be said a more modern form, which was better suited to ...whereas Jenson's style made a strong appeal to the sense of beauty prevalent in the period of Art Nouveau, today our taste in architecture and typography inclines towards simpler and more disciplined forms." ...|$|E
500|$|... {{is one of}} the two antagonistis of [...] and a {{descendant}} of the Ōtsutsuki clan. A pale, androgynous man, {{he is a member of}} the Ōtsutsuki clan who was the reason Kaguya created the Zetsu Army for, who comes to Earth to plant a new Shinju as the one he used is dying from using up its world's resources. Momoshiki possesses both a pair of Byakugan and Rinnegan, the latter located on his palms, which he uses to absorb and release ninjutsu. He also consumes red pills that enhances his abilities. Having apparently captured Gyuki from Killer Bee, Momoshiki and his partner Kinshiki come to Konohagakure with the objective of capturing Kurama from Naruto. The two manage to abduct Naruto to their dimension after destroying the Chunin Exams stadium, but before they could finish the extraction process, the pair are confronted by Boruto, Sasuke, and the four Kage. Overwhelmed, Momoshiki consumes a makeshift red pill from Kinshiki's body, making him even stronger with another Rinnegan appearing on his forehead. However, he is ultimately killed by Naruto and Boruto's combined Rasengan. But Momoshiki used his final living moments to have a private discussion with Boruto by freezing time, noting the untapped potential the boy possesses while cryptically warning him of the tribulations he will <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> future. Momoshiki is voiced by Daisuke Namikawa in Japanese and by Xander Mobus in the English dub.|$|E

2500|$|Doomadgee family spokesman, Brad Foster, {{claimed that}} after the men had been put into the cells, fifteen minutes lapsed before a seven-second check was done on the inmates. Forty two minutes later a second police officer {{observed}} that Mulrunji was a strange colour and was cold to the touch. The officer {{could not find a}} pulse. [...] When alerted to this, Arresting Officer Chris Hurley came into the cell and thought he could detect a pulse.

[...] During this time no attempts were made to resuscitate the prisoner, although the autopsy found that {{there would have been no}} chance of saving him.

2500|$|As a {{performance}} artist he enjoyed creating the costumes, and often shocking audiences. He first {{appeared at the}} Anthony D'Offay Gallery in London in 1988. In a signature performance, he would appear on stage in outlandish drag or other costume, looking very huge. He would sing and dance about. Then suddenly, much to the audience's surprise, he would drop onto his back and simulate giving birth to a petite and naked young woman, who was his friend and assistant Nicola Bateman. She had been hidden {{for the first part}} of the performance by being strapped to Leigh's belly with her <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> crotch. Then she would slip out of her harness, and appear to pop out of Bowery's belly along with a lot of stage blood and links of sausages, while Bowery wailed. [...] Bowery would then bite off the umbilical cord and the two would take a bow. Boy George said he saw it a number of times, and that it [...] "never ceased to impress or revolt".|$|E

He continued to lead his men {{despite the fact that}} the muscles and tendons in his arm were mangled and a small artery was severed. A fourth ball hit him in his shoulder. Despite pleas that he go to the rear, he continued to lead his men. He was finally stopped by a ball that hit him in the face, passing through his left cheek and out his jaw. He fell with his <b>face</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> cap and might have drowned in his own blood if it had not drained out through a bullet hole in the cap.
