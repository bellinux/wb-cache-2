What critic would be so persistent in engaging in fraud and conspiracy on such a time-scale? There seemed to be no precedent. Nor was it possible to track down how reliable the rumor might be.|$|E
25|$|The {{debate over}} how much of Genji was {{actually}} written by Murasaki Shikibu has <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> centuries and is unlikely to ever be settled unless some major archival discovery is made. It is generally accepted that the tale was finished {{in its present form}} by 1021, when the author of the Sarashina Nikki wrote a diary entry about her joy at acquiring a complete copy of the tale. She writes that there are over 50 chapters and mentions a character introduced {{at the end of the}} work, so if other authors besides Murasaki Shikibu did work on the tale, the work was done very near to the time of her writing. Murasaki Shikibu's own diary includes a reference to the tale, and indeed the application to herself of the name 'Murasaki' in an allusion to the main female character. That entry confirms that some if not all of the diary was available in 1008 when internal evidence suggests convincingly that the entry was written.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to these, {{the government of}} Goodluck Jonathan had several running scandals including the BMW purchase by his Aviation Minister, $250 million plus security contracts to militants in the Niger Delta, massive corruption and kickbacks in the Ministry of Petroleum, the Malibu Oil International scandal, and several scandals involving the Petroleum Ministry including accusations of sweetheart deals with select fronts and business people to divert public wealth. In the dying days of Goodluck Jonathan's administration, the Central Bank scandal of cash tripping of mutilated notes also broke out, where {{it was revealed that}} in a four-day period, 8 billion naira was stolen directly by low-level workers in the CBN. This revelation excluded a crime that is suspected to have <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> years and went undetected until revealed by whistle-blower.

500|$|Little of that Troy remains {{due to an}} 1820 fire {{which started}} in a First Street stable and {{eventually}} consumed much of the extant village. A column at 225 River Street bears a stone indicating that this was where the fire was stopped after it had <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> weeks. Unlike its classical namesake, Troy rebuilt quickly, with newer brick homes and commercial buildings, built to stricter standards, replacing the old ones and expanding again. The Hart-Cluett Mansion, an 1827 Federal style house on Second Street, {{is one of the}} best surviving buildings from this era. [...] Although it was previously attributed to Philip Hooker, new research has determined that the house's architect was Martin Euclid Thompson and the builder was John Bard Colegrove.|$|E
500|$|Planning for {{the coup}} had <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> over a year, with Đông {{recruiting}} disgruntled officers. This included his commander, Colonel Nguyễn Chánh Thi. In 1955, Thi had fought for Diệm against the Bình Xuyên organised crime syndicate in the Battle for Saigon. This performance so impressed Diệma lifelong bachelorthat he thereafter referred to Thi as [...] "my son". However, the Americans {{who worked with}} Thi were less impressed. The CIA described Thi as [...] "an opportunist and a man lacking strong convictions". An American military advisor described Thi as [...] "tough, unscrupulous, and fearless, but dumb". There is some dispute as to whether Thi participated in the coup of his free choice. According to some sources, Thi was still an admirer of Diệm and was forced at gunpoint by Đông and his supporters to join the coup at the last minute, having been kept unaware of the plotting. According to this story, Thi's airborne units were initially moved into position for the coup without his knowledge.|$|E

500|$|Paolini and {{his family}} toured across the United States {{promoting}} the book. Over 135 talks were given at bookshops, libraries, and schools, many with Paolini dressed up in a medieval costume; but the book did not receive much attention. Paolini said he [...] "would stand behind a table in my costume talking all day without a break– and would sell maybe forty books in eight hours if I did really well. [...] It was a very stressful experience. I couldn't have <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> very much longer." [...] In the summer of 2002, American novelist Carl Hiaasen was on vacation {{in one of the}} cities that Paolini gave a talk in. While there, Hiaasen's stepson bought a copy of Eragon that he [...] "immediately loved". He showed it to Hiaasen, who brought the book {{to the attention of the}} publishing house Alfred A. Knopf. Michelle Frey, executive editor at Knopf, contacted Paolini {{and his family}} to ask if they were interested in having Knopf publish Eragon. The answer was yes, and after another round of editing, Knopf published Eragon in August 2003, with a new cover, drawn by John Jude Palencar.|$|E
500|$|The {{debate on}} the death toll has <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> many decades {{to the point where}} some historians have begun to {{question}} its usefulness on the grounds that excessive quibbling over the precise death toll has distracted from the study of other more important facets of the massacre. Daqing Yang, a historian at George Washington University, believes that [...] "an obsession with figures reduces an atrocity to abstraction and serves to circumvent a critical examination of the causes of and responsibilities for these appalling atrocities" [...] and Carol Gluck concurs that [...] "The crucial historical question remains the moral one: how could ordinary Japanese have done what they did? Numerological arguments about the death count and distinctions of comparative atrocities do not address this point." [...] However, Masahiro Yamamoto printed a rebuttal of Gluck's statement in his book Nanking: Anatomy of an Atrocity, arguing that [...] "To determine the extent and nature of [...] responsibility, the 'numerological arguments about the death count and distinctions of comparative atrocities,' which [...] termed as irrelevant to the moral question, are essential. Only after firmly establishing 'historical particularities' can one clearly define Japan’s responsibility. And based on a clear definition of the responsibility there can be an answer to the 'moral' question." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Achim, the population-exchange texts do not {{exhibit a}} racist agenda, {{and are also}} [...] "non-imperialistic". They are [...] "in unison" [...] with Antonescu's {{policies}} of ethnic cleansing, but were not in themselves {{the basis of a}} government program. Nonetheless, one of the memos stands as a historical premiere, since Manuilă made official claims about a [...] "Gypsy problem", again describing the Romanies as a [...] "dysgenic" [...] threat, [...] "social and national non-values, and a racial hazard". He also assessed that Romanies had been systematically under-counted in the 1930 census, and that this apparent assimilation reflected [...] "extreme humanitarianism" [...] on the Romanian side, and had <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> far too long. According to scholar Dennis Deletant, this approach is [...] "redolent of Nazi ideology", seeking [...] "scapegoats for the woes of the Romanian people". Deletant notes that Manuilă's eugenic ideas about the Romanies did in fact shape Antonescu's [...] "ethnic policies", leading to the Romanies' deportation.|$|E

2500|$|Coca has a {{long history}} of {{cultivation}} in the Andes, and has always been a traditional part of Peruvian life. [...] However, the narcotic properties of coca were known only locally until 1786, when Lamarck listed the leaf in his botanical encyclopedia. [...] After the arrival of the Spanish, coca cultivation increased and its use became more common and widespread. [...] Since 1543, coca has been internationally recognized for its trading value, and regulations imposed upon it have attached increasing economic importance to the plant. [...] Exchange of the coca leaf between consumers in the highlands and growers in the low-lying hills has <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> at least the last millennium, strengthening local economic ties. [...] Between 1884 and 1900, coca and cocaine grew in popularity for medical purposes and mass consumption in the United States. [...] From 1905 to 1922, anti-cocaine sentiments in the US resulted in criminalization of both coca and cocaine. It was not until the 1920s that US diplomats began to extend drug prohibitions internationally.|$|E
2500|$|Because uplift rates {{associated}} with large New Madrid earthquakes {{could not have}} occurred continuously over geological timescales without dramatically altering the local topography, studies {{have concluded that the}} seismic activity there cannot have <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> longer than 64,000 years, making the New Madrid Seismic Zone (NMSZ) a young feature, or that earthquakes and the associated uplift migrate around the area over time, or that the NMSZ has short periods of activity interspersed with long periods of quiet. [...] Archaeological studies have found from studies of sand blows and soil horizons that previous series of very large earthquakes have occurred in the NMSZ in recent prehistory. Based on artifacts found buried by sand blow deposits and from carbon-14 studies, previous large earthquakes like those of 1811–1812 appear to have happened around AD 1450 and around AD 900, as well as approximately AD 300. Evidence has also been found for an apparent series of large earthquakes around 2350 BC. About 80km southwest of the presently-defined NMSZ but close enough to be {{associated with}} the Reelfoot Rift, near Marianna, Arkansas, two sets of liquefaction features indicative of large earthquakes have been tentatively identified and dated to 3500 BC and 4800 BC. These features were interpreted to have been caused by groups of large earthquakes timed closely together.|$|E
2500|$|Evidence {{from the}} reign of [...] King Henry VIII seems to show the abbey {{suffering}} from neglect and maladministration in its later years. Abbot Richard Lye lavished {{the resources of the}} monastery on his own family. On 25 October 1508 he granted to his sister Joan and her husband, John Copeland, a large weekly ration of bread and ale, twelve wagonloads of wood annually from Lythwood, and tithes of corn and hay from the townships of Prescott and Stanwardine in the Wood, in Baschurch parish. They also received property: a dwelling house and a shop in Shrewsbury, and meadowland and another home in Colneham. It seems that this generosity with others' property had <b>gone</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> some time, as they were also given the reversion of further meadowland then occupied by Joan and the abbot's father, Lodovic Lye. The gifts were limited to Joan's lifetime, apart from the shop and houses, which were to pass to her husband for his lifetime if he survived her. Episcopal visitations from the time of Abbot Richard Baker complain of unpaid debts, poor accounting, buildings in decay and land leased without consulting the chapter. This apparently refers to the grants to Joan and John Copeland, which had been made nominally on behalf of abbot and convent together. The infirmary was in ruins and Thomas Butler, the subprior, had taken its glass for his own chamber.|$|E
