5|$|The burbot, a {{predatory fish}} native to streams and lakes of North America and Eurasia, is also {{commonly}} mistaken for bowfin. Burbots {{can be distinguished}} by their <b>flat</b> <b>head</b> and chin barbel, long anal fin, and pelvic fins situated beneath the pectoral fins.|$|E
5|$|A broad muzzle {{is found}} on the river otter's <b>flat</b> <b>head,</b> and the ears are round and inconspicuous. The rhinarium is bare, with an obtuse, {{triangular}} projection. Eyes of the animal are small and placed anteriorly. A short, broad rostrum for exhaling and a long, broad cranium define the relatively flat skull. The river otter's nostrils and ears close during submersion, inhibiting water from entering them. Its vibrissae (whiskers) are long and thick, enhancing sensory perception underwater and on land.|$|E
5|$|Baleen {{whales are}} {{cetaceans}} classified under the parvorder Mysticeti, and consist of four extant families: Balaenidae (right whales), Balaenopteridae (rorquals), Cetotheriidae (pygmy right whale), and Eschrichtiidae (gray whale). Balaenids are distinguished by their enlarged head and thick blubber, while rorquals and gray whales generally have a <b>flat</b> <b>head,</b> long throat pleats, {{and are more}} streamlined than Balaenids. Rorquals {{also tend to be}} longer than the latter. Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) and artiodactyls are now classified under the order Cetartiodactyla, often still referred to as Artiodactyla (given that the cetaceans are deeply nested with the artiodactyls). The closest living relatives to baleen whales are toothed whales both from the infraorder Cetacea.|$|E

40|$|This project {{deals with}} the {{numerical}} analysis of 2 stroke engine scavenging in two cases. One with an existing condition (<b>Flat</b> <b>headed</b> pistons) and another with a new design (Dome headed piston). The numerical analysis is done with help of CFD software ANSYS FLUENT 14. 5. Here, the modeling of engine piston with <b>flat</b> <b>headed</b> type and with dome headed types was done in workbench. In ANSYS FLUENT after the geometrical design, for the dynamic motion meshing is used and set up species transport model also. At first the scavenging effect of <b>flat</b> <b>headed</b> piston is analyzed. Later the simulation of piston with dome headed type was also checked. Analyzing the variations from each and selected the best method for scavenging. Finally the scavenging efficiency is calculated for both type arrangements...|$|R

5|$|Crocodilians are large, low-slung aquatic {{reptiles}} {{with long}} snouts and {{large numbers of}} teeth. The head and trunk are dorso-ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed. It undulates {{from side to side}} to force the animal through the water when swimming. The tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull. The nostrils, eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the <b>flat</b> <b>head</b> enabling them to remain above {{the surface of the water}} when the animal is floating. Valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged. Unlike other reptiles, crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.|$|E
5|$|The King Charles Spaniel and {{the other}} types of toy spaniels were {{crossbred}} with the Pug in the early 19th century {{to reduce the size}} of the nose, as was the style of the day. The 20th century saw attempts to restore lines of King Charles Spaniels to the breed of Charles II's time. These included the unsuccessful Toy Trawler Spaniel and the now popular Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. The Cavalier is slightly larger, with a <b>flat</b> <b>head</b> and a longer nose, while the King Charles is smaller, with a domed head and a flat face.|$|E
5|$|However, many {{traits that}} appear to be simple adaptations are in fact exaptations: {{structures}} originally adapted for one function, but which coincidentally became somewhat useful for some other function in the process. One example is the African lizard Holaspis guentheri, which developed an extremely <b>flat</b> <b>head</b> for hiding in crevices, as can be seen by looking at its near relatives. However, in this species, the head has become so flattened that it assists in gliding from tree to treeâ€”an exaptation. Within cells, molecular machines such as the bacterial flagella and protein sorting machinery evolved by the recruitment of several pre-existing proteins that previously had different functions. Another example is the recruitment of enzymes from glycolysis and xenobiotic metabolism to serve as structural proteins called crystallins within the lenses of organisms' eyes.|$|E

25|$|There {{were other}} bow fibula {{variations}} of the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. The Divided Bow type has an arched bow and a long foot. The arch {{was made up of}} two, or even three, separate, but parallel, arches. These arches are either wide and flat or narrow and tall. The Trident fibula has a rounded arch and long foot and a wide, <b>flat</b> <b>head</b> plate with three points. The entire fibula looks like a trident. Claims that this was the standard fibula of the Roman navy are unfounded.|$|E
25|$|Some {{species may}} show {{morphological}} adaptations, {{such as a}} <b>flat</b> <b>head</b> and an upturned mouth, {{that allow them to}} perform ASR without breaking the water surface (which would make them more visible to aerial predators). One example is the mummichog, whose upturned mouth suggests surface feeding, but whose feeding habits are not particularly restricted to the surface. In the tambaqui, a South American species, exposure to hypoxia induces within hours the development of additional blood vessels inside the lower lip, enhancing its ability to take up oxygen during ASR. Swimming upside down may also help fishes perform ASR, as in some upside-down catfish.|$|E

25|$|In the Jagannath tradition, one {{particularly}} popular in {{eastern and central}} regions of India, he is more often called Balabhadra. Balarama is one in the triad, wherein Balarama is shown together with his brother Jagannath (Krishna) and sister Shubhadra (Lakshmi). Jagannath is identifiable from his circular eyes compared to oval of Shubhadra and almond shaped eyes of the abstract icon for Balarama. Further, Balarama's face is white, Jagannath's icon is dark, and Subhadra icon is yellow. The third difference is the <b>flat</b> <b>head</b> of Jagannath icon, compared to semi-circular carved head of abstract Balarama. The shape of Balabhadra's head, also called Balarama or Baladeva in these regions, varies in some temples between somewhat flat and semi-circular.|$|E
25|$|There are {{numerous}} types of post-Roman fibulae. The so-called Gothic group of bow fibulae have a round or triangular <b>flat</b> <b>head</b> plate, often with 3, 5 or 7 knobs, a small arched bow {{and a long}} flat diamond shaped foot. They were widely used by the Germanic Visigoths, Ostrogoths, and Gepids, and the non-Germanic Slavs and Avars, and are found over a wide part of southern and western Europe in the 5th and 6th centuries AD. There are also {{a wide variety of}} Anglo-Saxon fibulae from the 5th to 7th century such as the equal-arm type and the small-long type. Most Viking fibulae are variations on the ring or annular design (see below).|$|E
25|$|When {{shown with}} Balabhadra and Shubhadra, he is {{identifiable}} from his circular eyes compared to oval or almond shape {{shape of the}} other two abstract icons. Further, his icon is dark, while Balabhadra's face is white, and Subhadra icon is yellow. The third difference is the <b>flat</b> <b>head</b> of Jagannath icon, compared to semi-circular carved heads {{of the other two}}. They are accompanied by the Sudarshana Chakra (a round discus). It is approximately the same height as Balabhadra, is red in colour, carved from a wooden pillar and clothed, unlike its traditional representation as a small metal discus in other Vishnu temples. Jagannath iconography, when he is depicted without companions, shows only his face, neither arms nor torso. This form is sometimes called Patita Pavana, or Dadhi Vaman.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scholars}} such as Kulke and Tripathi {{have proposed}} tribal deities such as Stambhesveri or Kambhesvari to be a possible contributor to the Jagannath triad. However, according to Starza, these are not really tribal deities, but Shaiva deities adopted by tribes in eastern states of India. Yet another proposal for tribal origins is through the medieval era cult of Lakshmi-Narasimha. This hypothesis relies on the unusual <b>flat</b> <b>head,</b> curved mouth and large eyes of Jagannath, which may {{be an attempt to}} abstract an image of a lion's head ready to attack. While the tribal Narasimha theory is attractive states Starza, a weakness of this proposal is that the abstract Narasimha representation in the form does not appear similar to the images of Narasimha in nearby Konark and Kalinga temple artworks.|$|E
