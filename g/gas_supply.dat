5|$|An {{entry level}} diver must learn the {{techniques}} of breathing underwater through a demand regulator, including clearing it of water and recovering it if dislodged from the mouth, and clearing the mask if it is flooded. These are critical survival skills, and if not competent the diver is at {{a high risk of}} drowning. A related skill is sharing breathing gas with another diver, both as the donor and the recipient. This is usually done with a secondary demand valve carried for this purpose. Technical and professional divers will also learn how to use a backup <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> carried in an independent scuba set, known as the emergency <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> or bailout cylinder.|$|E

We document the cross-country heterogeneity in the extent of diversification. We also show how the extent of diversification changes if account is taken of the political risk attached to suppliers; the size of the importing country; and transportation risk.

5|$|Keeping this in mind, it is {{not hard}} to see why {{technical}} divers who do long deep dives require multiple cylinders or rebreathers, and commercial divers normally use surface-supplied diving equipment, and only carry scuba as an emergency <b>gas</b> <b>supply.</b>|$|E
5|$|Surface {{supplied}} divers {{are usually}} required to carry an emergency <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> sufficient {{to allow them}} to return to a place of safety if the main <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> fails. The usual configuration is a back mounted single cylinder supported by the diver's safety harness, with first stage regulator connected by a low-pressure hose to a bailout block, which may be mounted {{on the side of the}} helmet or band-mask or on the harness to supply a lightweight full-face mask. Where the capacity of a single cylinder in insufficient, plain manifolded twins or a rebreather may be used. For closed bell bounce and saturation dives the bailout set must be compact enough to allow the diver to pass through the bottom hatch of the bell. This sets a limit on the size of cylinders that can be used.|$|E
5|$|A diving {{cylinder}}, scuba tank or {{diving tank}} is a gas cylinder used to store and transport the high pressure breathing gas required by a scuba set. It {{may also be}} used for surface-supplied diving or as decompression gas or an emergency <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> for surface supplied diving or scuba. Cylinders provide gas to the diver through the demand valve of a diving regulator or the breathing loop of a diving rebreather.|$|E

5|$|Closed-circuit: A second rebreather {{containing}} one or {{more independent}} diving cylinders for its <b>gas</b> <b>supply.</b> Using another rebreather as a bail-out is possible but uncommon. Although the long duration of rebreathers seems compelling for bail-out, rebreathers are relatively bulky, complex, vulnerable to damage and require more time to start breathing from, than easy-to-use, instantly available, robust and reliable open-circuit equipment.|$|E
5|$|Diving {{cylinders}} {{are filled}} by attaching a high-pressure <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> to the cylinder valve, opening the valve and allowing gas to {{flow into the}} cylinder until the desired pressure is reached, then closing the valves, venting the connection and disconnecting it. This process involves a risk of the cylinder or the filling equipment failing under pressure, {{both of which are}} hazardous to the operator, so procedures to control these risks are generally followed.|$|E
5|$|Isolation {{manifolded}} twin sets or manifolded doubles {{with two}} regulators, consist of two back mounted cylinders with their pillar valves {{connected by a}} manifold, with a valve in the manifold that can be closed to isolate the two pillar valves. In {{the event of a}} problem with one cylinder the diver may close the isolator valve to preserve gas in the cylinder which has not failed. The advantages of this configuration include: a larger <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> than from a single cylinder; automatic balancing of the <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> between the two cylinders; thus, no requirement to constantly change regulators underwater during the dive; and in most failure situations, the diver may close a valve to a failed regulator or isolate a cylinder and may retain access to all the remaining gas in both the tanks. The disadvantages are that the manifold is another potential point of failure, and there is a danger of losing all gas from both cylinders if the isolation valve cannot be closed when a problem occurs. This configuration of cylinders is often used in technical diving.|$|E

5|$|Professional divers may be {{required}} by legislation or industry codes of practice to carry sufficient reserve gas {{to enable them to}} reach a place of safety, such as the surface, or a diving bell, based on the planned dive profile. This reserve gas is usually required to be carried as an independent emergency <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> (EGS), also known as a bailout cylinder, set or bottle. This usually also applies to professional divers using surface-supplied diving equipment.|$|E
5|$|The pony is {{typically}} a 2- to 5-litre cylinder. Its capacity determines {{the depth of}} dive and decompression duration for which it provides protection. Ponies may be fixed to the diver's buoyancy compensator (BC) or main cylinder behind the diver's back, or can be clipped to the harness at the diver's side or chest or carried as a sling cylinder. Ponies provide an accepted and reliable emergency <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> but require that the diver is trained to use them.|$|E

5|$|For safety, divers {{sometimes}} {{carry an}} additional independent scuba cylinder {{with its own}} regulator to mitigate out-of-air emergencies should the primary breathing <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> fail. For much common recreational diving where a controlled emergency swimming ascent is acceptably safe, this extra equipment is not needed or used. This extra cylinder {{is known as a}} bail-out cylinder, and may be carried in several ways, and can be any size that can hold enough gas to get the diver safely back to the surface.|$|E
5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} {{are manufactured}} with domed (convex) and dished (concave) bottoms. The dished profile {{allows them to}} stand upright on a horizontal surface, and is the standard shape for industrial cylinders. The cylinders used for emergency <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> on diving bells are often this shape, and commonly have a water capacity of about 50 litres ("J"). Domed bottoms give a larger volume for the same cylinder mass, and are the standard for scuba cylinders up to 18 litres water capacity, though some concave bottomed cylinders have been marketed for scuba.|$|E
5|$|The use of pure oxygen for {{accelerated}} decompression {{is limited}} by oxygen toxicity. In open circuit scuba the upper limit for oxygen partial pressure is generally accepted as 1.6 bar, equivalent {{to a depth of}} 6msw (metres of sea water), but in-water and surface decompression at higher partial pressures is routinely used in surface supplied diving operation, both by the military and civilian contractors, as the consequences of CNS oxygen toxicity are considerably reduced when the diver has a secure breathing <b>gas</b> <b>supply.</b>|$|E

5|$|Due to {{similarities}} between the perpetrators, the murders were compared by Czech media and experts to a mass murder that took place two years before in FrenÅ¡tÃ¡t pod RadhoÅ¡tÄ›m, another Moravian town lying 90km northwards. In the attack, a 57-year-old man, AntonÃ­n BlaÅ¾ek, attempted {{to blow up a}} block of flats after having been ordered to vacate his flat that had been foreclosed by creditors. He first blocked both exits from the building, and then removed and opened the main <b>gas</b> <b>supply</b> into the building's corridor. Interrupted, BlaÅ¾ek set the gas on fire before the gas could spread throughout the whole building. The explosion and subsequent fire, however, were large enough to demolish part of the building, killing BlaÅ¾ek and five other people immediately and wounding eleven others, one of whom died on 17 February 2015.|$|E

The Mexican Red Cross dispatched 2,000food parcels to {{the southern tip of}} Baja California Sur. In the city of MulegÃ©, <b>gas</b> <b>supply,</b> which was necessary to run generators, was low, drinking water was gone, and the airstrip was covered with mud. Many homeless residents initially stayed with friends or in government-run shelters. Throughout the Baja California peninsula, thousands remained without water or electricity two days after the storm, although a pilot from Phoenix prepared to fly to the disaster area with 100gallons (380litres) of water. Other pilots were expected to execute similar flights, as well. The office of Baja California Sur Tourism stated that minimal damage occurred to the tourism infrastructure, with only minimal delays to airports, roads, and maritime facilities. The Episcopal Relief and Development delivered food, clothing, medicine, and transportation to about 100families, and gave mattresses to about 80families.|$|E
