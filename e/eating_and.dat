5|$|It is {{theorized that}} the use of birth control pills should affect eating {{behaviour}} as they minimise or remove the fluctuations in hormone levels. The neurotransmitter serotonin is also thought {{to play a role in}} food intake. Serotonin is responsible for inhibiting <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> controlling meal size, among other things, and is modulated in part by ovarian hormones.|$|E
5|$|Metamorphs weigh about 2g, {{while the}} largest adults can reach 50g. Individual frogs can vary {{substantially}} in body weight due {{to changes in}} the amount of stored fat, recent <b>eating,</b> <b>and</b> egg formation. While it is known to live 10–15 years in captivity, the frog's lifespan in the wild is not well understood.|$|E
5|$|Rodents {{have been}} used as food, for clothing, as pets, and as {{laboratory}} animals in research. Some species, in particular the brown rat, the black rat, and the house mouse, are serious pests, <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> spoiling food stored by humans, and spreading diseases. Accidentally introduced species of rodents are often considered to be invasive, and have caused the extinction of numerous species, such as island birds, previously isolated from land-based predators.|$|E

5|$|The {{hypothalamus}} {{is a small}} region at {{the base}} of the forebrain, whose complexity and importance belies its size.

60|$|After all, what {{is wanted}} in this world? Is it not that men should <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> drink, and {{read and write}}, and say their prayers? Does not that include everything, {{providing}} that they <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> drink enough, read and write without restraint, and say their prayers without hypocrisy? When we talk of the advances of civilization, do we mean anything but this, that men who now <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> drink badly shall <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> drink well, and that those who cannot read and write now shall learn to do so--the prayers following, as prayers will follow upon such learning? Civilization does not consist in the eschewing of garlic or the keeping clean of a man's finger-nails. It may lead to such delicacies, and probably will do so. But the man who thinks that civilization cannot exist without them imagines that the church cannot stand without the spire. In the States of America men do <b>eat</b> <b>and</b> drink, and do read and write.|$|R

5|$|Birds {{occupy a}} wide range of {{ecological}} positions. While some birds are generalists, others are highly specialised in their habitat or food requirements. Even within a single habitat, such as a forest, the niches occupied by different species of birds vary, with some species feeding in the forest canopy, others beneath the canopy, and still others on the forest floor. Forest birds may be insectivores, frugivores, and nectarivores. Aquatic birds generally feed by fishing, plant <b>eating,</b> <b>and</b> piracy or kleptoparasitism. Birds of prey specialise in hunting mammals or other birds, while vultures are specialised scavengers. Avivores are animals that are specialised at preying on birds.|$|E
5|$|In animals, vacuoles {{serve in}} {{exocytosis}} and endocytosis processes. Endocytosis refers to when substances {{are taken into}} the cell, whereas for exocytosis substances are moved from the cell into the extracellular space. Material to be taken-in is surrounded by the plasma membrane, and then transferred to a vacuole. There {{are two types of}} endocytosis, phagocytosis (cell <b>eating)</b> <b>and</b> pinocytosis (cell drinking). In phagocytosis, cells engulf large particles such as bacteria. Pinocytosis is the same process, except the substances being ingested are in the fluid form.|$|E
5|$|Overgrazing, {{agriculture}} {{and the loss}} of wetland and moist grassland have reduced the availability of suitable habitat for the African crake in many areas, such as some parts of the southern KwaZulu-Natal coast which have been urbanised or planted with sugarcane. In other areas, grassland may have increased locally in recent years as woodland is cleared. This crake is considered to be good <b>eating,</b> <b>and</b> is killed for food in some regions. Despite these adverse factors, it appears to be under no real threat.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} March 2010 with Chopra and Irrfan Khan in Kashmir. Locations included Shalimar Bagh and Dal Lake in Srinagar. The {{cast and crew}} were provided with two-tier security coverage by the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and the Jammu & Kashmir Police, due to unrest in the valley. The film was also shot in Gulmarg, Delhi and Coorg, which included extensive shooting in the forests. Other locations were Puducherry, Mumbai, Hyderabad and in Russia. During filming Chopra was restricted from <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> drinking while donning the prosthetic makeup (which took five hours to apply).|$|E
5|$|Sturm {{left early}} on, but Konietzko {{continued}} performing, {{at one point}} having twenty people in his troupe, which by then was engaged in antics such as fire <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> throwing entrails at audiences. Konietzko then returned to Hamburg, where he joined up with Peter Missing in his new band Missing Foundation. Drummer Nicklaus Schandelmaier, who had recently moved to Hamburg from Frankfurt, also joined the group, and took the stage name En Esch. Although the group did some live performances, Konietzko and Esch dropped out of Missing Foundation before any recordings were made {{and went back to}} work as KMFDM, collaborating with Hamburg-based studio owner Raymond Watts.|$|E
5|$|The Great Hall, {{leading off}} from the corridor, was the most {{important}} communal <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> living room, but by the time Montacute was completed the traditional Great Hall was largely an anachronism. Such halls continued to be built, however, albeit as at Montacute on a smaller scale. For the first few years after its completion, the servants continued to dine in the hall, but the family and honoured guests now ate in the Great Chamber above. The hall now served as a room to receive and also for processions to commence to the grander rooms above.|$|E

5|$|The pudú is {{a solitary}} animal whose {{behavior}} in the wild is largely unknown because of its secretive nature. Pudús are crepuscular, most active in the morning, late afternoon, and evening. Their home range generally extends about , much of which consists of crisscrossing pudú-trodden paths. Each pudú has its own home range, or territory. A single animal's territory is marked with sizable dung piles found on paths and near <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> resting areas. Large facial glands for scent communication allow correspondence with other pudú deer. Pudús do not interact socially, other than to mate. An easily frightened animal, the deer barks when in fear. Its fur bristles and the pudú shivers when angered.|$|E
5|$|These ulcers occur {{periodically}} {{and heal}} completely between attacks. In {{the majority of}} cases, the individual ulcers last about 7–10 days, and ulceration episodes occur 3–6 times per year. Most appear on the non-keratinizing epithelial surfaces in the mouth (i.e. anywhere except the attached gingiva, the hard palate and the dorsum of the tongue), although the more severe forms, which are less common, may also involve keratinizing epithelial surfaces. Symptoms range from a minor nuisance to interfering with <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> drinking. The severe forms may be debilitating, even causing weight loss due to malnutrition.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had wanted}} to study for a {{doctorate}} and proceed with a career in archaeology, Buczynski was dying. He became ill with the Toxoplasma gondii parasite, which took advantage of his weakened immune system. He suffered partial paralysis on his right side as well as brain lesions, leaving him irritable and withdrawn, and required hospitalization. Upon release, he moved to Atlanta to be with Muto in January 1989. By this stage, he was unable to attend to basic tasks on his own, including <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> dressing himself, and required almost constant care, from both Muto and from carers based at St. Joseph Hospital. He began to talk with the hospital's Roman Catholic priest and finally decided to return to the faith of his birth, undertaking his confession of reconciliation in February. In March, his condition deteriorated, and he was admitted to the hospital, where he fell into a coma and died on the morning on Thursday, March 16.|$|E
