If they are losing, it is because they're doing something wrong. Poker is skill, it isn't luck. In the long run, <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>day,</b> you cannot get lucky all the time." [...] In the book Deal Me In, Giang said [...] "Poker is a game of skill with an element of luck, not a game of luck with an element of skill." [...] He discusses how he lost his twenty million dollar bankroll playing craps, a game of luck. He says nowadays he gets a physical revulsion when he goes near a game of craps, or any game of dice. He believes that if he sticks to poker, he will always make money in the long run.|$|E

My toes were crushing each other and every step was torture. Every tiny village was either at the bottom of a steep, craggy mountain or at the top of a hill. Either way, it was a daily scramble up or down. All the books, blogs, films, and friends who came before me didn’t prepare me for this. They call it “walking the Camino” but it is walking, hiking, climbing, scrambling, limping...|$|E

S. The media hounds are now hot on the chase of Chen’s daughter (Chen Hsing-yu 陳幸妤), trying to goad her into outbursts that play well on the evening news and YouTube. Is the fact that Taiwan’s former president is suspected of corruption newsworthy? Obviously. Do these allegations merit a thorough investigation? Definitely. If the evidence warrants it, should indictments be filed? Unquestionably. Is this the most pressing issue facing Taiwan? That’s another matter entirely. To a certain extent, the saturation reporting of the Chen story reminds one of the second of Sunzi 孫子’s Thirty-six Stratagems (三十六計), namely “Besieging Wei to Rescue Zhao” (圍魏救趙), which is based on events during the Warring States Era, when the Qi general Sun Bin 孫臏 (d. 316 BCE; considered a descendent of Sunzi) attacked the Wei capital of Daliang in order to distract Wei troops from the siege of the Zhao capital of Handan (the exhausted Wei army was eventually ambushed and defeated).

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} Learning-by-Doing (LBD) system for {{assisting}} learners of English {{as a foreign}} language, by providing educational content generated based on real-world behaviors in a sensorized environment. The LBD system consists of an ultrasonic location sensing system developed by the authors and an educational content server. The location of the student is monitored by ultrasonic sensors embedded around the learning room. The system voices English verbs related to objects around the student so that the student can obtain the language skills for expressing various activities of everyday life in English by performing real-world behaviors. The system was implemented experimentally in an English language school. Six subjects participated in an experiment evaluating the educational efficacy of the proposed system. Recall rates of learned verbs were compared among three methodologies, ”Learning by text,” ”Learning by pictures and text, ” and ”Learning by doing”. Recall rates were measured at the following intervals: soon <b>after</b> the learning task, 2 <b>days</b> <b>after,</b> 4 <b>days</b> <b>after,</b> 7 <b>days</b> <b>after,</b> and 14 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> the learning task. The {{results indicate that the}} proposed LBD system increased the recall rate of learned words by 113 % 14 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> the learning task. Overall, the system significantly increased the average recall rate by 102 % in comparison to the other learning methodologies. I...|$|R
