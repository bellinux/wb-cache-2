40|$|The upper {{respiratory}} tract is continually assaulted with <b>harmful</b> <b>dusts</b> and xenobiotics carried on the incoming airstream. Detection of such irritants by the trigeminal nerve evokes protective reflexes, including sneezing, apnea, and local neurogenic inflammation of the mucosa. Although free intra-epithelial nerve endings can detect certain lipophilic irritants (e. g., mints, ammonia), the epithelium also houses a population of trigeminally innervated solitary chemosensory cells (SCCs) that express T 2 R bitter taste receptors along with their downstream signaling components. These SCCs have been postulated to enhance the chemoresponsive capabilities of the trigeminal irritant-detection system. Here we show that transduction by the intranasal solitary chemosensory cells is necessary to evoke trigeminally mediated reflex reactions to some irritants including acyl–homoserine lactone bacterial quorum-sensing molecules, which activate the downstream signaling effectors associated with bitter taste transduction. Isolated nasal chemosensory cells respond to the classic bitter ligand denatonium {{as well as to}} the bacterial signals by increasing intracellular Ca 2 +. Furthermore, these same substances evoke changes in respiration indicative of trigeminal activation. Genetic ablation of either Gα-gustducin or TrpM 5, essential elements of the T 2 R transduction cascade, eliminates the trigeminal response. Because acyl–homoserine lactones serve as quorum-sensing molecules for Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, detection of these substances by airway chemoreceptors offers a means by which the airway epithelium may trigger an epithelial inflammatory response before the bacteria reach population densities capable of forming destructive biofilms...|$|R

40|$|To {{develop a}} quick, safe, and {{effective}} method that allows workers at mineral processing operations to clean their dust-soiled clothing periodically throughout the workday. Background Reducing workers' respirable dust exposure to silica and other <b>harmful</b> <b>dusts</b> and contaminants {{is an ongoing}} goal in the U. S. mining industry. One area of known worker exposure is from contaminated work clothes. A U. S. Bureau of Mines report documented {{a number of cases}} where a tenfold increase in a worker's dust exposure was measured from contaminated work clothes. In these cases, the dust emitted from clothing caused the worker's dust exposure to exceed the permissible exposure limit in less than 2 hours. The most effective way to eliminate this dust source is to have workers clean or change their work clothes. There are two federal regulations that impact the clothes-cleaning process. The first states that at no time shall compressed air be directed toward a person, but that when compressed air is used, then all necessary precautions shall be taken to protect persons from injury. The second regulation states that compressed air should only be used for cleaning purposes when it is less than 30 psi and used along with personal protective equipment. For the mining industry, by default, the only approved method to perform clothes cleaning is to have workers vacuum their clothes using a HEPA filter system. This is very difficult and time-consuming and, in most instances, not very effective. Most workers would prefer to use a single compressed air hose to blow dust from their work clothes. However, not only is this method prohibited by law, it usually creates a significant dust cloud in the work environment and contaminates coworkers...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFugitive dust on longwalls {{has always}} been an issue of concern for production, safety and the health of workers in the {{underground}} coal mining industry globally. Longwall personnel can be exposed to <b>harmful</b> <b>dust</b> from multiple dust generation sources. With the increase in production created from the advancement in longwall equipment, dust loads have also increased and this has resulted in an increase in exposure levels to personnel. Control processes in place for the mitigation of dust vary from mine to mine, with each individual mine having a dust mitigation setup that is only effective for that particular mine operation. While the focus in the past has quite correctly been on improving the controls on dust exposure, the future lies in identifying the efficiency of installed controls on operating longwalls, evaluating them through robust and quantitative sampling methods to ensure the most effective controls are in place to prevent occupational disease from occurring. This paper will examine the current controls for dust mitigation on longwalls and propose a new testing methodology to determine dust mitigation efficiency (DME) of installed controls for both respirable and inhalable dust. The main objective of this proposed sampling method is to identify dust loads at independent sources of dust generation in mg/tonne produced on longwall faces and quantify the efficiency of installed controls for the mitigation of produced dust on longwall faces...|$|E
40|$|Studies on {{composition}} {{and distribution of}} dust deposition are necessary for the risk assessment of dust to atmospheric quality. We studied the vertical distribution pattern of dust and metal (Cu, Fe, Pb, Zn) deposition up to 33 m height in urban environment. Integrated geochemical, mineralogical and magnetic study of the seasonally sampled dust helped to specify our knowledge {{on the use of}} magnetic susceptibility for tracking its deposition. <b>Harmful</b> <b>dust</b> and metal deposition may occur even at great heights and at the low-traffic side of buildings. Re-suspension of local surface materials dominates the dust deposition primarily in summer and spring due to weather conditions, and it may overwrite the influence of recent anthropogenic activities on dust composition. The accepted air-flow models should be modified by taking the local conditions (weather, morphology, etc.) into account. All studied metals showed strong enrichment in the dust and could be characterized by similar vertical deposition pattern to dust. The total susceptibility was found to be much more useful proxy for tracking dust and metal deposition than massspecific susceptibility. Using the former, potential errors arising from sampling practice of settled dust could be eliminated. The most important heavy-metal-bearing phases were iron oxides and clay minerals. Their different behavior during the dust deposition is reflected by the vertical metal distribution patterns.

40|$|This {{study is}} the first to {{investigate}} the mineral composition of the atmospheric particulate matter deposited at Rio Tinto, Spain, an historical mining district of world-class importance, with emphasis on metal-bearing particles and their environmental implications. The dustfall is composed of quartz, feldspars, phyllosilicates (mica, chlorite and/or kaolinite) and a variety of accessory heavy minerals, the most common being primary sulfides (pyrite, chalcopyrite with minor galena, sphalerite and bornite) and their oxidation products (notably goethite, hematite and jarosite). This mineral assemblage suggests a local source of wind-blown dust and it is consistent with the large deposition levels of sulfide-related elements (As, Bi, Cd, Cu, Pb, Sb and Zn) registered at the sampling site adjacent to the mine waste dumps. However, the generation of potentially <b>harmful</b> <b>dust</b> particles is not restricted to mine wastes. Anthropogenic metallic compounds arising from a nearby hazardous waste disposal centre can make a relevant additional contribution to the metal deposition, particularly for Fe, Ni, Cr and Mn.

40|$|Occupational allergy {{is defined}} as allergy caused by {{exposure}} to a product that {{is present in the}} workplace. Both elements of the definition are important as the agent should be specific to the workplace and be causally related to the disease. The recognition of occupational allergy goes back to Olaus Magnus who, in 1555, wrote ‘When sifting the chaff from the wheat, one must carefully consider the time when a suitable wind is available that sweeps away the <b>harmful</b> <b>dust.</b> This ﬁne-grained material readily makes its way into the mouth, congests in the throat, and threatens the life organs of the threshing men. If one does not seek instant remedy by drinking one’s beer, one may never more, or only for a short time, be able to enjoy what one has threshed. ’ Since then, many agents encountered at the workplace have been associated with allergic reactions in various organs. These include, for example, high-molecular-weight agents in flour, castor beans or vegetable gums, and low-molecular-weight agents such as platinum salts, diisocyanates or those in wood dust. Reactions can lead to permanent impairment and disability. Due to its signiﬁcant medical, social, and possibly, legal consequences, a deﬁnitive diagnosis of occupational allergy, including identiﬁcation of the causative agent, is imperative. Whenever possible, prevention programs should be set up in high-risk workplaces. Occupational allergy can affect many target organs, including the lungs, nose, eyes, and skin. This chapter focuses on occupational allergy affecting upper and lower airways, i. e. occupational asthma and occupational rhinitis. Early diagnosis of OA and early removal from exposure to the causative agent in the workplace improve the chance of recovery. Suspecting work exposure as a cause of asthma in all individuals with new-onset or worsening asthma, and asking key questions about work exposures while history taking, is crucial in the work-up of OA. Despite the efforts of standardization, the diagnosis of OA and OR still remains complicated and controversial. OR is frequently present in OA, and may precede development of OA, particularly with HMW sensitizers. OA and OR can lead to permanent impairment and disability...|$|E
40|$|The {{environment}} {{is a very}} significant factor in our everyday lives from the aspect of impact on health. It affects us at work and in the home. From the aspect of atmospheric quality {{the condition of the}} environment in the Czech Republic is not very good and represents a serious problem in the Moravian-Silesian Region. Air-borne dust in particular is a very significant pollutant in the city of Ostrava. This work is concerned with atmospheric quality, particularly dust particles, in Ostrava. The work is divided into a theoretical and empirical section. The theoretical section begins with a brief presentation of the history of Ostrava City. I subsequently discuss the quality of the atmosphere throughout the whole Moravian-Silesian Region. The next chapter is specifically about the solid pollutants, which {{can be found in the}} atmosphere. This chapter also specifies the health risks, what causes the harmful effect, describes classification of dust particles depending on harmful component content, division of dust fractions into PM 10 and PM 2, 5 and describes the main sources of PM 10 and PM 2, 5 dust fractions. The next chapter is titled: Toxicologically significant substances bound to solid particles. One sub-chapter covers the group of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which includes the significant atmospheric pollutant called benzo(a) pyrene. The second sub-chapter covers the group of heavy metals and their characteristics with a description of their key harmful effects on human health. The next chapter, called measuring methods for PM 10 fractions, covers classification of measuring methods for automated and manual metering stations. The following chapter discusses legislation concerning air-borne dust. The legislation is divided into two key Czech laws concerning protection of the atmosphere and additional European guidelines. After this chapter we mention the specific stations examining the quality of the atmosphere in Ostrava. The following stations were selected: Station Fifedy, Station Mariánské Hory, Station Zábřeh, Station Přívoz and Station Bartovice ? Radvanice. These metering stations are distributed throughout the territory of the city of Ostrava, thus providing results on concentrations of air-borne dust, which occurred during the period from 2006 to 2011 throughout the territory of Ostrava. Further chapters were devoted to emission limits for protection of human health and the maximum amounts by which these could be exceeded. The emission limits for specific pollutants over 24 hours and 1 calendar year are given in this chapter. The last chapter in the theoretical section is concerned with the smog situation and the conditions for announcing and ending a smog situation. The research or empirical section assesses the results of research, which focused on individuals living within Ostrava City and their awareness of the <b>harmful</b> <b>dust.</b> The results of the questionnaire survey are graphically portrayed in the results chapter. The results of measurements taken by the Czech Hydro-meteorology Office of PM 10 dust fractions for the period between 2007 and 2011 are also processed here.

This contained 19 questions and was distributed to 200 respondents, of which 106 were men and 94 were women. I used secondary data analysis for my additional research, which concerned dust particles. I believe that this work will be useful for offices in the field of communication with citizens, or it can be provided to citizens to read and to inform them of the problems concerning the atmosphere in Ostrava. I also believe that it may be recommended for reading by other towns and cities, which have problems with increased dust pollution...|$|E

The exact number of workers affected is unknown due to unreliable figures and reluctance among authorities of the time to acknowledge and document any direct link between the chrome dust and the health dangers. The exposure to the dust was such that the workers were referred to locally as ‘White’s Dead Men’ or ‘White’s Canaries’ due to their bleached faces and yellow chrome dust-covered clothing. The pamphlets proved very popular and exposed the conditions at Whites works to the wider public.

Construction workers may be exposed to silica dust through their work with building materials. Abrasive blasting, chipping, hammering, drilling, sawing, grinding, crushing, loading, hauling, dumping, demolishing, and dry sweeping are activities which allow the dust to enter the air. The use of dust control systems during drilling and sawing can reduce dust exposures. Local exhaust ventilation is important; good work practices also reduce much of the exposure. Abrasives containing less than 1 % crystalline silica should be used during abrasive blasting to prevent <b>harmful</b> quartz <b>dust</b> from being released. Respirators should only be used until adequate dust control measures are in place and should never be the primary method of protection.

The results showed that the electromagnetic braking torque could approach 198 N·m. Thus the design method is feasible. Instruction It is universally acknowledged that the braking system plays a significant role in vehicle safety. Vehicle’s safety performance is always an important research direction of modern automotive technology. Nowadays, with the development of engine power and the increase of vehicle speed, severe problems such as thermal recession, brake disc wear, <b>harmful</b> friction <b>dust</b> and the time delay in hydraulic system occur on conventional friction brake. In order to overcome these problems...|$|R
