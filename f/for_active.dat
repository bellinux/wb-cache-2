5|$|A {{graduate}} of the Virginia Military Institute and Harvard Law School, Lansdale was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army Reserve in 1933. He was called up <b>for</b> <b>active</b> duty in June 1941, and {{was assigned to the}} Investigations Branch in the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2 (military intelligence) of the War Department General Staff. He became involved with the Manhattan Project in 1942, eventually becoming Brigadier General Leslie Groves's special assistant for security. Lansdale coordinated the activities of the Manhattan Project's field security teams with those of other agencies such as the FBI.|$|E
5|$|About 90% {{of those}} {{infected}} with M. tuberculosis have asymptomatic, latent TB infections (sometimes called LTBI), {{with only a}} 10% lifetime chance that the latent infection will progress to overt, active tuberculous disease. In those with HIV, {{the risk of developing}} active TB increases to nearly 10% a year. If effective treatment is not given, the death rate <b>for</b> <b>active</b> TB cases is up to 66%.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} whether structural priming {{of production}} latencies {{is sensitive to}} the same factors known to influence persistence of structural choices: structure preference, cumulativity and verb repetition. In two experiments, we found structural persistence only for passives (inverse preference effect) while priming effects on latencies were stronger <b>for</b> the <b>actives</b> (positive preference effect). We found structural persistence for passives {{to be influenced by}} immediate primes and long lasting cumulativity (all preceding primes) (Experiment 1), and to be boosted by verb repetition (Experiment 2). In latencies we found effects <b>for</b> <b>actives</b> were sensitive to long lasting cumulativity (Experiment 1). In Experiment 2, in latencies we found priming <b>for</b> <b>actives</b> overall, while <b>for</b> passives the priming effects emerged as the cumulative exposure increased but only when also aided by verb repetition. These findings are consistent with the Two-stage Competition model, an integrated model of structural priming effects for sentence choice and latenc...|$|R
5|$|After {{graduating from}} the Virginia Military Institute, Lansdale joined the United States Army Reserve. He was {{commissioned}} as a second lieutenant in the field artillery branch in 1933, and was promoted to first lieutenant in 1937. He was called up <b>for</b> <b>active</b> duty in June 1941, {{a few months before}} the United States entered World War II, and was assigned to the Investigations Branch in the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-2 (military intelligence) of the War Department General Staff.|$|E
5|$|After {{taking a}} minor {{covering}} {{role in the}} return of British troops to Athens in October 1944, Ledbury was reduced to reserve in March 1946, and was not again commissioned <b>for</b> <b>active</b> service, remaining in peacetime commission longer than most of her class, before being sold for scrap in 1958. The destroyer was broken up at Rosyth in April 1958.|$|E
5|$|As he {{was unable}} to travel during 1916, Kropotkin found himself in {{frequent}} correspondence with others, including Jean Grave, who visited Kropotkin from France with his wife. Together, they discussed the war and Kropotkin's firm support for it. At Kropotkin's suggestion {{that he would like to}} have been a combatant were he younger, Grave suggested publishing a document urging anarchists to support the war effort on the side of the Allied Powers. Initially hesitant, due to his personal inability to sign up <b>for</b> <b>active</b> duty, Kropotkin was eventually persuaded by Grave.|$|E

He made it a {{condition}} of his acceptance that Northcott be given the appointment of Commander-in-Chief of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF) in Japan.

5|$|At {{the start}} of the Second World War Gielgud volunteered <b>for</b> <b>active</b> service, but was told that men of his age, thirty-five, would not be wanted for at least six months.

5|$|He {{became a}} United States citizen in 1946 after {{serving in the}} United States Army and {{achieving}} the rank of sergeant. In so doing, he lost his Canadian citizenship, as Canadian law prior to 1977 limited dual citizenship. After the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 he attempted to sign up <b>for</b> <b>active</b> duty with the army's flying service (the United States Air Force was not formed until 1947), but was turned down for being too old. He therefore spent World War II in the United States Army and among his duty stations was Fort Lewis, located in Tacoma, Washington.|$|E

5|$|Heterodontosaurus is {{commonly}} {{regarded as a}} herbivorous dinosaur. In 1974, Thulborn proposed that the tusks of the dinosaur played no important role in feeding; rather, {{that they would have}} been used in combat with conspecifics, for display, as a visual threat, or <b>for</b> <b>active</b> defence. Similar functions are seen in the enlarged tusks of modern muntjacs and chevrotains, but the curved tusks of warthogs (used for digging) are dissimilar.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Pollack’s career {{led into}} politics. A summer {{internship}} with the American Jewish Congress prompted a one-year role with the AJC. He {{worked as a}} lobbyist on legislation that would permit religious headwear <b>for</b> <b>active</b> military personal in noncombat settings. Pollack then relocated to Los Angeles to work for Winner & Associates, a leading political public relations firm. He was assigned to consult the Major Baseball League during the labor strife in the early-1990s.

5|$|Jackson {{followed}} his eldest brother, John, into the Royal Australian Air Force Reserve, {{known as the}} Citizen Air Force, in July 1937. With the outbreak of World WarII, Les was called up <b>for</b> <b>active</b> duty in the RAAF on 6November 1939. He learnt to fly as an air cadet at RAAF Station Point Cook, Victoria. Graduating as a pilot in February 1940, he served initially with No.23 Squadron at Archerfield, Queensland. In July 1941, he was posted to the South West Pacific theatre with No.21 Squadron in Singapore. Initially operating CAC Wirraways, the unit converted to Brewster Buffalos in September that year.|$|E

He was assigned to a training squadron for flying instruction in August. On 15October, he gained his wings and officer's commission.
