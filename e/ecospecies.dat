40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 122 - 126) Analysis of {{data from}} population studies made throughout the range of Yucca whipplei Torrey in California reveals two distinct, independently selected variation patterns. Pattern 1. Plant Habit. The distribution of plant habit in populations is correlated with climatic severity and apparently results from selection for or against the seedling progeny. Four kinds of populations are differentiated {{on the basis of}} habit and the climates in which they are found. These are: Rhizomatous (maritime), Mixed-Habit (transitional), Monocarpic (mild, mesic) and Caespitose (severe, continental). Pattern 2. Plant Morphology. On the basis of leaf morphology and other vegetative characters, the populations of Y whipplei fall into four groups (here called Series), all of which are independent of habit differences. Series 1 consists of populations with yellowish green, long, narrow, thin, flexible leaves (subspecies intermedia Haines and subspecies typica Haines). The leaves of populations in Series 2 A are long, wide, thin, flexible and blue-green in color (subspecies Parishii/Jones/Haines and part of subspecies percursa Haines). Populations of Series 2 B have short, thick, stiff, narrow, blue-green leaves (Subspecies caespitosa, Jones/Haines and part of ssp. percursa). Series 3 includes al 1 populations of intermediate foliage characteristics that have apparently resulted from hybridization between populations belonging to two or more different Series (Series 3 consists of large populations of ssp. caesptitosa,, ssp. intermedia and ssp. percursa. Since all four climate-associated habit types constitute sizeable populations in each Series, they form clinically varying ecotypes of three <b>ecospecies</b> (Series 1, 2 A and 2 B). Somewhat restricted fertility in populations of Series 3 (hybrid) is found in the field, indicating that the parental races, ancestral to the <b>ecospecies</b> I recognize, ultimately developed genetic barriers. Therefore the Yucca whipplei complex; being itself somewhat isolated from other Yucca species by their different sets of pollinator moths, constitutes a cenospecies...|$|E

In order to investigate the effect of expired pesticides on the yield and growth rate of green algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, a study was conducted as per the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) guideline number 201. Fifteen expired pesticide formulations, most commonly used in Indian agriculture, were tested in comparison with their unexpired counterparts. The expired pesticide formulations studied belonged to various class and functional groups: organophosphate, pyrethroid-based insecticides; azole-based fungicides; acetamide, propionate, acetic acid-based herbicides; fungicides mixtures containing two actives—azole and dithiocarbamate. The toxicity endpoints of yield (EyC 50 : 0 – 72 h) and growth rate (ErC 50 : 0 – 72 h) of Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata for each pesticide formulation (both expired and unexpired pesticides) were determined statistically using TOXSTAT 3. 5 version software. The results pointed out that some expired pesticide formulations exhibited higher toxicity to tested algal species, {{as compared to the}} corresponding unexpired pesticides. These data thus stress the need for greater care to dispose expired pesticides to water bodies, to avoid the effects on aquatic <b>ecospecies</b> tested. 1...|$|E
40|$|Density {{compensation}} is a community-level phenomenon in which {{increases in the}} abundance of some species may offset the population decline, extirpation, or absence of other potentially interacting competitors. In this paper we examine the evidence for density compensation in neotropical primate assemblages using data from 56 hunted and nonhunted, but otherwise undisturbed, forest sites of Amazonia and the Guianan shields from which population density estimates are available for all diurnal primate species. We found good evidence of density compensation of the residual assemblage of nonhunted mid-sized species where the large-bodied (ateline) species had been severely reduced in numbers or driven to local extinction by subsistence hunters. Only weak evidence for density compensation, however, was detected in small-bodied species. These conclusions {{are based on the}} effects of ordinal measures of hunting pressure on the aggregate primate biomass across different size classes after controlling for the effects of forest type and productivity. These results are interpreted primarily in relation to patterns of niche partitioning between different primate functional groups or <b>ecospecies.</b> This study suggests that while overhunting drastically reduces the average body size in multi-species assemblages of forest vertebrates, depletion of large-bodied species is only partially offset (i. e. undercompensated) by smaller taxa...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} paper (VAN DER MAAREL, 6) {{the results of}} an investigation of herbarium specimens of Cochlearia officinalis and C. anglica as to their distinguishing characters have been published. Now similar measurements of populations of these two species are described of which the results are shown in fig. 1, a-d and table I. It appears that the so obtained averages are very near those found in measurements of herbarium specimens. Table II gives the 1 % confidential limits of those averages. Characters a, d and f seem to be the most useful ones. The occurrence of intermediate populations is considered by the author as a result of introgressive hybridization. The importance of the phenomenon for the study of some aspects of plant taxonomy, ecology and sociology (especially study of the alliance Agropyro-Rumicion) is emphasized. Some suggestions for modern interpretation are given. C. officinalis and C. anglica should be termed <b>ecospecies</b> sensu Turesson, forming a commiscuum sensu Danser, which may be regarded as a dysploidion sensu Camp & Gilly. Intermediate forms/ populations could be termed C. cline officinalis-anglica (after Huxley); determination of hybrid index (Anderson) should be carried out. Information is required about the occurrence of hybrid swarms not only from the Netherlands, but also from abroad...|$|E
