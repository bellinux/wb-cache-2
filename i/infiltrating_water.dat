Geologically, the aquifer is composed of limestone from the Cretaceous period, about 100 million years old. Fractures, fissures, conduits, and caves have developed in this limestone. Both physical forces, such as faulting, and chemical forces, such as dissolution of limestone by <b>infiltrating</b> <b>water,</b> have enlarged these voids.

50|$|The {{carbonate}} {{rocks that}} compose the Floridan aquifer system have highly variable hydraulic properties, including porosity and permeability. Transmissivity within the aquifer {{system has been}} reported over a range of more than six orders of magnitude, from less than 8 ft2/d to greater than 9,000,000 ft2/d, {{with the majority of}} values ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 ft2/d. Where the aquifer is unconfined or thinly confined, <b>infiltrating</b> <b>water</b> dissolves the rock and transmissivity tends to be relatively high. Where the aquifer is thickly confined, less dissolution occurs and transmissivity tends to be lower. In the first regional map depicting transmissivity variation across the aquifer, Miller (1986) showed that transmissivity values exceed 250,000 ft2/d where the aquifer system is either unconfined or thinly confined. In areas where the aquifer is thickly confined, Miller (1986) indicated lower transmissivity was related primarily to textural changes and secondarily to the thickness of the rocks. Micritic limestone in southern Florida and in the updip outcrop areas was identified as having much lower transmissivity than elsewhere in the system.|$|E
50|$|In those {{layers and}} beds of tuff {{that have been}} spread out over {{considerable}} tracts of country and which are most frequently encountered among the sedimentary rocks, smaller fragments preponderate greatly and bombs {{more than a few}} inches in diameter may be absent altogether. A tuff of recent origin is generally loose and incoherent, but the older tuffs have been, in most cases, cemented together by pressure and the action of <b>infiltrating</b> <b>water,</b> making rocks which, while not very hard, are strong enough to be extensively used for building purposes (e.g. in the neighborhood of Rome). If they have accumulated subaerially, like the ash beds found on Mt. Etna or Vesuvius at the present day, tuffs consist almost wholly of volcanic materials of different degrees of fineness with pieces of wood and vegetable matter, land shells, etc. But many volcanoes stand near the sea, and the ashes cast out by them are mingled with the sediments that are gathering {{at the bottom of the}} waters. In this way ashy muds or sands or even in some cases ashy limestones are being formed. As a matter of fact most of the tuffs found in the older formations contain admixtures of clay, sand, and sometimes fossil shells, which prove that they were beds spread out under water.|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} for draining water from unsaturated soil is presented that utilizes a sloping system {{of a fine}} sand overlying a coarser sand or gravel. In this configuration, referred to as an unsaturated drainage layer, the sand laterally drains water that accumulates above the capillary break provided by the coarse material. Drainage capacity is maximized when the sand layer has sufficient moisture to be relatively conductive, yet remains unsaturated so as to prevent failure of the capillary break. Results from field tests indicate substantial downward <b>infiltrating</b> <b>water</b> can be laterally diverted with an unsaturated drainage layer. Numerical simulations are presented that illustrate the potential effectiveness of unsaturated drainage layers to divert sufficient <b>infiltrating</b> <b>water</b> and prevent the development of positive pore water pressures...|$|E
40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarIn 1990 it {{was decided}} to prepare a new "Policy Plan on Drinking- and Industrial Water Supply" to replace the sectoral {{planning}} and formulated policy in the "Second Structural Policy Plan for Drinking- and Industrial Water Supplies" (1984). During the preparation of this Plan, several alternatives were developed for meeting future water needs. One alternative comprises a combination of production modules. These alternatives will be compared by several criteria. The criteria presented in this report, which are in most cases subdivided into sub-criteria are: "public health", "abiotic environment", "nature", "landscape", "land use", "technological feasibility", flexibility", vulnerability", "economy" and "administrative/egal aspects". An important part of the information about groundwater, surface <b>water</b> and <b>infiltrated</b> <b>water</b> related supplies necessary for the application of the weighing method is obtained from three so-called "Base Reports". This last report deals primarily with the groundwater collected for public water supplies, particularly concerning drinking-water propduction. Much information of a highly variable quality is used.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{laboratory}} investigation of transport layer using drainage cell system {{are presented in}} this paper. The drainage cell was sandwiched between grade V and grade VI residual soil in a two-dimensional laboratory slope model. Coarse particles of gravel were compacted inside the holes of the drainage cell to facilitate capillary break development and modify hydraulic properties between the soil layers. The grades V and VI residual soils were compacted in the slope model to their dry densities. The whole set up was subjected to three rainfall patterns of 1. 0586 x 10 - 5 m/s, 1. 2014 x 10 - 6 m/s and 3. 7337 x 10 - 7 m/s for 2 hour, 24 hour and 7 day, respectively. These rainfall intensities were applied through a rainfall simulator {{which is part of}} the laboratory set up. The results show that inclusion of drainage cell in between the two soil layers impedes percolation of the <b>infiltrating</b> <b>water</b> into the lower grade V residual soil layer and facilitates lateral movement of the <b>infiltrating</b> <b>water</b> along the grade VI and transport layer interface towards the toe of the slope model.

30|$|Underground rivers have an up to 30  % lower {{mineralization}} (EC), on average, {{compared to}} wells indicating a shorter residence time and/or {{a higher proportion}} of quickly <b>infiltrating</b> <b>water</b> especially after precipitation events. This explains the slightly lower Ca and HCO 3 concentration in most of the investigated underground rivers during the pronounced rainy season in 2012 in contrast to the dry season hydrochemistry. Enhanced Al and Fe concentrations in some subsurface rivers (Golek, Toto, Sodong Dedapayu) are probably the result of substantial surface water input (Table  1). In Sodong Dedapayu, a strong runoff from the fields was visually observable during sampling which also caused a considerable decline of most element concentrations due to dilution, and negative calcite saturation. In Toto River, however, all other parameters apart from Al and Fe remain similar compared to dry season. As a consequence, not dilution by <b>infiltrating</b> <b>water</b> but rather resuspension of previously deposited intrakarstic sediment is probably the dominating process causing the Al and Fe increase.|$|E

The purpose of this research effort was to review the groundwater contamination literature as it relates to stormwater. Prior to urbanization groundwater is recharged by rainfall-runoff and snowmelt infiltrating through pervious surfaces including grasslands and woods. This <b>infiltrating</b> <b>water</b> is relatively uncontaminated. Urbanization, however, reduces the permeable soil surface area through which recharge by infiltration occurs. This results in much less groundwater recharge and greatly increased surface runoff. In addition the waters available for recharge carry increased quantities of pollutants.

40|$|International audienceInventory of {{unstable}} hillslopes, hydrogeological mapping and hydrochemical {{characteristics of}} natural spring waters {{were used to}} determine the long-term relationships between groundwater and gravitational instabilities in the Upper Tinée Valley (South-East French Alps). Water chemistry and flow records allow to propose a conceptual model of water flow within unstable rocky slopes and to back-calculate the volume of <b>infiltrated</b> <b>water</b> and the flow velocity in the aquifers for different deformation states of the slopes. An increase in infiltrated yield, flow velocity and porosity is observed and linked to collapsed and toppled structures in the upper parts of the hillslopes. In these areas, perched aquifers take place in the reworked media. When a large landslide occurs, it modifies the geometry of the slope and bypasses the perched flows down {{to the foot of the}} slope. With long-term continuous slope deformation, the associated effect between water flows and slope destabilization changes. In the fractured rock, the coupled effect corresponds to rising water pressures with limited volumes of infiltrated water; in the more fractured and permeable collapsed and toppled areas, the volumes of <b>infiltrated</b> <b>water</b> increase with a lower variation of water pressures...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Pumping of {{groundwater}} near a stream induces the infiltration of stream {{water into the}} nearby aquifers, and this induced stream infiltration may result in concems about water quality at the well. This paper analyzes the migration process of the <b>infiltrated</b> stream <b>water</b> toward a pumping well. MODFLOW is used to simulate the surface water infiltration from a shallow stream to an alluvial aquifer, and MODPATH is used to record {{the locations of the}} <b>infiltrated</b> <b>water</b> particles during their movement to the well. Pathelines were plotted over a cross-section, which is perpendicular to the stream and contains the pumping well, to show the hydraulic connectivity between the pumping well and the stream. The area of influence zone, as well as the travel time, was used to characterize the migration processes of the stream water particles. Generally, the movement of the <b>infiltrated</b> stream <b>water</b> in the nearby aquifer is very slow, and it often takes more than six months for the <b>infiltrated</b> stream <b>water</b> to arrive at the pumping well located only several hundred meters from the stream. A number of variables reduce the hydraulic connectivity and thus the migration process between the stream and the well. They include a deep pumping well, a short pumping duration and small pumping rate, a larger distance between the stream and the pumping well, a smaller vertical hydraulic conductivity, a low-permeability streambed, an aquitard located below the stream but above the top of the well screen, and a regional hydraulic gradient toward the stream.

40|$|The {{infiltration}} of river water into aquifers is of high relevance to drinking-water production {{and is a}} key driver of biogeochemical processes in the hyporheic and riparian zone, but the distribution and quantification of the <b>infiltrating</b> <b>water</b> are difficult to determine using conventional hydrological methods (e. g., borehole logging and tracer tests). By time-lapse inverting crosshole ERT (electrical resistivity tomography) monitoring data, we imaged groundwater flow patterns driven by river water infiltrating a perialpine gravel aquifer in northeastern Switzerland. This was possible because the electrical resistivity of the <b>infiltrating</b> <b>water</b> changed during rainfall-runoff events. Our time-lapse resistivity models indicated rather complex flow patterns {{as a result of}} spatially heterogeneous bank filtration and aquifer heterogeneity. The upper part of the aquifer was most affected by the river infiltrate, and the highest groundwater velocities and possible preferential flow occurred at shallow to intermediate depths. Time series of the reconstructed resistivity models matched groundwater electrical resistivity data recorded on borehole loggers in the upper and middle parts of the aquifer, whereas the resistivity models displayed smaller variations and delayed responses with respect to the logging data in the lower part. This study demonstrated that crosshole ERT monitoring of natural electrical resistivity variations of river infiltrate could be used to image and quantify 3 D bank filtration and aquifer dynamics at a high spatial resolution.

Two MAR sites were constructed by Karlskrona municipality on Johannishus Esker in Sweden. One of these sites, Vång, was monitored for electrical conductivity and electrical resistivity (using electrical resistivity tomography - ERT) during a 9 -week tracer infiltration test. The aim of the monitoring was to map the pathways of the <b>infiltrated</b> <b>water,</b> with the overall goal to increase the efficiency of the MAR. ERT proved useful in determining both the nature of the esker formation and the water migration pathways. In Vång, the esker ridge follows a tectonically controlled paleovalley.

During the tracer test, the <b>infiltrated</b> <b>water</b> was detected in the area close to the infiltration ponds, whereas far-situated observation wells were less affected. For sequential infiltration and recharge periods in MAR, the timing of the well pumping is another important factor.

40|$|Different {{studies have}} shown that surface waters contain {{perfluorinated}} compounds (PFCs) in the low ng/L range. Surface waters are used to produce drinking water and PFCs have been shown to travel through the purification system and form a potential threat to human health. The specific physicochemical properties of PFCs cause them to be persistent and some of them to be bioaccumulative and toxic in the environment. This study investigates the evolvement of PFC concentrations in Rhine water and rainwater during dune water infiltration processes over a transect in the dune area of the western part of The Netherlands. The difference between <b>infiltrated</b> river <b>water</b> and rainwater in terms of PFC composition was investigated. Furthermore, isomer profiles were investigated. The compound perfluorobutanesulfonate (PFBS) was found at the highest concentrations of all PFCs investigated, up to 37 ng/L in <b>infiltrated</b> river <b>water</b> (71 +/- 13 % of Sigma PFCs). This is in contrast with the predominant occurrence of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) reported in literature.
