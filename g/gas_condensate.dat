5|$|While some 55 ionic {{species have}} been {{reported}} in fresh ash leachates the most abundant species usually found are the cations Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ and the anions Cl−, F− and SO42−. Molar ratios between ions present in leachates suggest that in many cases these elements are present as simple salts such as NaCl and CaSO4. In a sequential leaching experiment on ash from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, chloride salts were found to be the most readily soluble, followed by sulfate salts Fluoride compounds are in general only sparingly soluble (e.g., CaF2, MgF2), with the exception of fluoride salts of alkali metals and compounds such as calcium hexafluorosilicate (CaSiF6). The pH of fresh ash leachates is highly variable, depending on the presence of an acidic <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> (primarily {{as a consequence of the}} gases SO2, HCl and HF in the eruption plume) on the ash surface.|$|E

25|$|Typically, blended bitumen {{contains}} about 30% natural <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> or other diluents and 70% bitumen. Alternatively, bitumen {{can also be}} delivered to market by specially designed railway tank cars, tank trucks, liquid cargo barges, or ocean-going oil tankers.

25|$|Natural {{gas from}} gas wells and from {{condensate}} wells, {{in which there}} is little or no crude oil, is called non-associated gas. Gas wells typically produce only raw natural gas, while condensate wells produce raw natural gas along with other low molecular weight hydrocarbons. Those that are liquid at ambient conditions (i.e., pentane and heavier) are called natural <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> (sometimes also called natural gasoline or simply condensate).|$|E
25|$|Alkenes are {{produced}} by hydrocarbon cracking. Raw materials are mostly natural <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> components (principally ethane and propane) in the US and Mideast and naphtha in Europe and Asia. Alkanes are broken apart at high temperatures, often {{in the presence of}} a zeolite catalyst, to produce a mixture of primarily aliphatic alkenes and lower molecular weight alkanes. The mixture is feedstock and temperature dependent, and separated by fractional distillation. This is mainly used for the manufacture of small alkenes (up to six carbons).|$|E

25|$|Following the {{successful}} {{operation of the}} Azipod-converted tankers Uikku and Lunni in the Northern Sea Route, Kværner Masa-Yards Arctic Research Centre developed the first double acting tanker concept in the early 1990s. The 90,000 DWT tankers were designed to transport oil and <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> from the Pechora Sea in the Russian Arctic, where ice conditions during winter can be considered moderate and the ships would operate mainly in astern mode, first to Murmansk and then Rotterdam, {{where most of the}} distance can be travelled in open water year round.

25|$|Although Venezuelan {{extra-heavy}} oil is less viscous than Canadian bitumen, much of {{the difference}} is due to temperature. Once the oil {{comes out of the}} ground and cools, it has the same difficulty in that it is too viscous to flow through pipelines. Venezuela is now producing more extra heavy crude in the Orinoco oil sands than its four upgraders, which were built by foreign oil companies over a decade ago, can handle. The upgraders have a combined capacity of , which is only half of its production of extra-heavy oil. In addition Venezuela produces insufficient volumes of naphtha to use as diluent to move extra-heavy oil to market. Unlike Canada, Venezuela does not produce much natural <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> from its own gas wells, and unlike Canada, it does not have easy access to condensate from new US shale gas production. Since Venezuela also has insufficient refinery capacity to supply its domestic market, supplies of naptha are insufficient to use as pipeline diluent, and it is having to import naptha to fill the gap. Since Venezuela also has financial problems – {{as a result of the}} country's economic crisis -, and political disagreements with the US government and oil companies, the situation remains unresolved.|$|E
