40|$|Abstract. Fatigue S-N {{relations}} are investigated experimentally on the grade B cast steel for Chinese railway freight car bogie frames. Group test method was employed. Results {{reveal that the}} fatigue cracks were initiated from the material cast shrinking cavities with hot ties. Distinct fatigue striations, river-like flowers, and second cracks appeared on the fracture surface in perpendicular to the fatigue crack path. Lots of dimples in the transient fracture district indicate that present material is ductile. Considering both the scattered S-N relations and no <b>fatigue</b> <b>limits</b> under variable loads, the S-N {{relations are}} measured probabilistically in terms of continuous declined probabilistic S-N curves including super-long life regime (SLLR) of> 107 cycles. Affordable novel approach, i. e. concurrent probability extrapolation method, was applied. The test S-N data in mid-long life regime (MLLR) and conventional <b>fatigue</b> <b>limits</b> are used. The curves are established by extrapolating the conventional S-N curves crossing the <b>fatigue</b> <b>limits,</b> in a concurrent probability manner, into the SLLR.

50|$|An {{important}} structural {{limitation of}} aluminium alloys is their lower fatigue strength compared to steel. In controlled laboratory conditions, steels display a <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit,</b> which is the stress amplitude below which no failures occur - the metal does not continue to weaken with extended stress cycles.

40|$|In {{previous}} investigations (Gough, Pollard, and Clenshaw 1951) s {{under the}} same general research programme, determinations were made of the intrinsic and vee-notched fatigue strengths of the first seven steels here investigated, under various combinations of bending and torsion. The intrinsic <b>fatigue</b> <b>limits</b> were found to fit reasonably to an ellipse quadrant, and the notched <b>fatigue</b> <b>limits</b> to a two-constant displaced ellipse or ‘ellipse arc’. The bulk of the present paper concerns the behaviour under combinations of bending and torsional stresses of test pieces with transverse holes, for the same seven steels. The <b>fatigue</b> <b>limits</b> under the various stress combinations {{have been found to}} fit reasonably to an ellipse arc of the same form as for the vee-notched specimens. The similarity in form of the ellipse arcs for the seven materials supports the theoretical conclusion that the shape of the curve is dependent only on the shape of the hole, and is independent {{of the nature of the}} material. The information given on strength reduction factors under various combinations of bending and torsion, together with the tables of results of supplementary static tests, should be of use in such problems as crankshaft design.

50|$|ME {{happens when}} a low-melting-point metal is placed in contact with a metal with higher melting point, so the latter is embrittled. It is often {{manifested}} by static fatigue. For example, as shown in Figure 1, in {{a test of the}} static fatigue of a 2024 aluminum coated with mercury, the alloy is subject to a stress level less than the value causing plastic flow, and {{the time it takes to}} fracture is measured. Usually a stress called static <b>fatigue</b> <b>limit</b> is present, representing the boundary below which the material does not fracture, no matter how long the test duration is.
