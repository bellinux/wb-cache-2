"Certainty taxpayer be reasonably certain of what any given set of circumstances" (Margo in this his tax Report, It is submitted that, at present, {{there is not the}} desired certainty regarding the treatment of unrealised <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>differences.</b> This is proven by the internal memorandum circularised by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, advising local Receivers of Revenue to put on hold all income tax returns with unrealised <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> losses and all objections to the disallowance of these losses until such time that it has, in consultation with professional bodies, been able to establish an acceptable solution to the problem (Commissioner for Inland Revenue, n. d.). No finality has been reached to date and uncertainty therefore still prevails {{on either side of the}} fence, resulting in losses to both parties. As a result of the Commissioner's instruction not to assess income tax returns with <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>differences,</b> Revenue suffers significant losses from a cash flow point of view. This is because a taxpayer is entitled to base his first and second provisional tax payment for a particular tax year on his "basic amount", this being his taxable income or assessed loss for the last tax year for which he has been assessed. For many affected taxpayers, this is their 1984 tax year in respect of which they reported a considerably lower taxable income than for their last year of assessment. This means that their first two provisional tax payments in respect of a particular tax year can be extremely low in comparison to their taxable income for their last year of assessment. There are also quite a few taxpayers who had an assessed loss for their 1984 tax year who are therefore not required to make a payment at all. It follows, therefore, that Revenue could improve its cash flow position by not allowing assessments to fall too far in arrears. Conversely, disallowance response to pay tax on purposes. taxpayers lose where they have objected to the of their <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> losses and are still awaiting a their objections as, in the meantime, they will have to the basis that the losses are not deductible for tax The direct effect of the disallowance of unrealised <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> losses would be that the after tax cost of borrowings from abroad would be unacceptably high, thus creating a bias towards local borrowing.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{identify}} the problem areas of trading in euro, while focusing on search for options of reducing costs related to euro account management and business transactions in an exporting company. In the theoretical part, various risks of international business are explained. The next chapter focuses on the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> risk management, followed by a chapter dedicated to hedging against the exchange rate risk, especially forwards, futures, swaps and options. In {{the conclusion of the}} literary review, the accounting of financial derivates and <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>differences</b> is listed. In the practical part of the thesis, data from a specific company with object in sewing textile products are used. This company exports its products in the European Union countries; therefore, the invoiced currency is euro. The company is assessed from a general point of view, with remarking the descending trend in the number of its employees, and using data from income statements. Further assessment of the company was done using benchmark, when the company was compared to four other companies with the same object, located in South Bohemia. The company placed fourth. Furthermore, the risks connected to the international business of the company ABC, a. s., are identified, with measures being suggested which could eliminate these risks and reduce costs related {{to the fact that the}} company is export-oriented. The next chapter is focused on the survey of bank institutions and exchange rate companies and, as a consequence, on analysis which options could be offered to the ABC, a. s., company and what are the costs related to these products. To reduce the payment costs in the ABC, a. s., company, two alternatives are suggested. In case the company manager is risk-aversive, the option of a well-established bank institution is offered. In the second case, when the manager is a risk-taker and would opt for a more profitable <b>exchange</b> rate, the <b>foreign</b> currency company would probably be the choice. Since the company does not hedge against the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> risk, the currency forward is suggested as the hedging instrument.

500|$|Covered {{interest}} rate parity (CIRP) {{is found to}} hold when there is open capital mobility and limited capital controls, and this finding is confirmed for all currencies freely traded in the present day. One such example is when the United Kingdom and Germany abolished capital controls between 1979 and 1981. Maurice Obstfeld and Alan Taylor calculated hypothetical profits as implied by {{the expression of a}} potential inequality in the CIRP equation (meaning a difference in returns on domestic versus foreign assets) during the 1960s and 1970s, which would have constituted arbitrage opportunities if not for the prevalence of capital controls. However, given financial liberalization and resulting capital mobility, arbitrage temporarily became possible until equilibrium was restored. Since the abolition of capital controls in the United Kingdom and Germany, potential arbitrage profits have been near zero. Factoring in transaction costs arising from fees and other regulations, arbitrage opportunities are fleeting or nonexistent when such costs exceed deviations from parity. While CIRP generally holds, it does not hold with precision due to the presence of transaction costs, political risks, tax implications for interest earnings versus gains from <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange,</b> and <b>differences</b> in the liquidity of domestic versus foreign assets.|$|R
