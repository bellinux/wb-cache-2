5|$|Noriega {{took great}} care to shape {{perceptions}} of himself. He permitted and encouraged rumors {{that as the}} chief of intelligence, he was in possession of negative information about <b>everybody</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country. Dinges suggests that the impression among some officials that Noriega made money off of every transaction in the country may have been cultivated by Noriega himself. Among opposition leaders in Panama he was seen variously as a sexual pervert, as a sadist, and a rapist. Within U.S. government circles contradictory images abounded; Noriega {{was seen as a}} CIA spy, a drug trafficker, a nationalist supporting Torrijos, an ally of Cuba, and an ally of Oliver North and the Contras. He was perceived as a trusted collaborator in the war against drugs, even as the DEA was investigating him for involvement in smuggling. By the time of his removal he had come to be hated in the U.S., and the invasion was portrayed as an attempt to remove an evil man. Dinges writes that these contradictory images played a large role in the U.S. government's self-contradictory policy towards Noriega.|$|E

25|$|While the German {{policy towards}} Jews was {{ruthless}} and criminal, their policy towards Christian Poles who helped Jews {{was very much}} the same.

In any apartment block or area where Jews were found to be harboured, <b>everybody</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> house would be immediately shot by the Germans.

25|$|The album {{tells the}} story of a dystopian society {{sheltered}} from nuclear annihilation by the Zone, a protected area created through the psychic powers of a seven-year-old boy named Artemus. The boy is manipulated by government officials into acting as a figurehead to gain public support for their rule, though Artemus himself has nearly absolute power over <b>everybody</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Zone. Artemus eventually leaves the area of safety he created, causing it to vanish as he departs. Pink World was a success among the critics, though sales were initially modest.

Hence, she asks JKB to translate the song he is singing into Tamil, which <b>everybody</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> audience can understand. He then gets angry and challenges her to demonstrate. She successfully demonstrates it and is applauded by the audience. In a few days, Sindhu apologizes to JKB and he finds out that she is an intellectual equal and admires her knowledge of music. However this intellectual attraction is misunderstood based on the cultural limitations. Gajapathi, who has promised not to lie, informs Bhairavi that her husband is going out with Sindhu.|$|E

25|$|Fai's {{real name}} is , and {{he was born with}} his {{identical}} twin brother, Fai, in Valeria Country. The birth of twins in the country was a bad omen, which led to many misfortunes upon the country. The king imprisoned them within a tower, just before he killed <b>everybody</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country. Eventually, Fei-Wang Reed appeared and offered to free one of them. Fai chose to save Yūi, resulting in Fai being thrown from the tower to his death, though Fei-Wang tampered with Yūi's memory to make him think that he chose his own life over Fai. Promising to return Fai to life if Yūi becomes his pawn, Fei-Wang bestowed two curses upon him. The curses are to kill whoever is a stronger magician than he is, and another curse will use his magic to collapse the world around them. He was soon found by Ashura-ō, who took in Yūi, having adopted the name Fai. Ashura conforted Fai, and gave him his tattoo to suppress the first curse. Fai eventually learned that Ashura's purpose was to be killed by Fai's first curse, as Ashura killed people in order to make his magic stronger.|$|E
