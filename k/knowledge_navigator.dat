One of the main criteria for the educational process quality when implementing asynchronous learning forms is {{the effectiveness of the}} self-organization system. The construction of this system is largely determined by the goals, the achievement of which is supposed to students as a training result. The authors propose a classification of learning objectives groups, enabling the main design criteria for educational trajectories identification. To those authors attribute sets of objectives: administrative, tentative and group of personal interest goals. The educational process is proposed to be considered as a structured set of training modules (courses), the material development of which- the form choice and training duration, the education area are determined by student's personal preference. The article introduces the concept of educational process modular construction and example of this concept implementation is given.

They visited Frankfurt fairs in 1477, where van Dorpp sold his wares to a German merchant from Antwerp, and Behaim was motivated by his mother to return in the fall where he worked with Bartels von Eyb (a friend of the family). Writing to his uncle, Leonhard Behaim (18 September 1478), he expressed his desire not to return to Malines and wanted to improve his commercial skills. He eventually worked for another merchant, Fritz Heberlein (a native of Nuremberg but established in Antwerp) who allowed him to learn arithmetic and improve his skills. In 1480, trade between Portugal and Flanders attracted Behaim to Lisbon, and he became involved with the mercantile interests and overseas exploration that was occurring in the capital (from Flanders, Germany and the Hanseatic League).

40|$|Nine {{cooperating}} rule-based systems, collectively called AUTOCREW {{which were}} designed to automate functions and decisions associated with a combat aircraft's subsystems, are discussed. The organization of tasks within each system is described; performance metrics were developed to evaluate the workload of each rule base and to assess the cooperation between the rule bases. Simulation and comparative workload results for two mission scenarios are given. The scenarios are inbound surface-to-air-missile attack on the aircraft and pilot incapacitation. The methodology used to develop the AUTOCREW knowledge bases is summarized. Issues involved in designing the navigation sensor selection expert in AUTOCREW's <b>NAVIGATOR</b> <b>knowledge</b> base are discussed in detail. The performance of seven navigation systems aiding a medium-accuracy INS was investigated using Kalman filter covariance analyses. A navigation sensor management (NSM) expert system was formulated from covariance simulation data using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) method and the ID 3 algorithm. ANOVA results show that statistically different position accuracies are obtained when different navaids are used, the number of navaids aiding the INS is varied, the aircraft's trajectory is varied, and the performance history is varied.

40|$|Path integration, the {{constant}} updating of the <b>navigator's</b> <b>knowledge</b> of position and orientation during movement, requires both visuospatial knowledge and memory. This study {{aimed to develop}} a systems-level understanding of human path integration by examining the basic building blocks of path integration in humans. To achieve this goal, we used functional imaging to examine the neural mechanisms that support the tracking and memory of translational and rotational components of human path integration. Critically, and in contrast to previous studies, we examined movement in translation and rotation tasks with no defined end-point or goal. Navigators accumulated translational and rotational information during virtual self-motion. Activity in hippocampus, retrosplenial cortex (RSC), and parahippocampal cortex (PHC) increased during both translation and rotation encoding, suggesting that these regions track self-motion information during path integration. These results address current questions regarding distance coding in the human brain. By implementing a modified delayed match to sample paradigm, we also examined the encoding and maintenance of path integration signals in working memory. Hippocampus, PHC, and RSC were recruited during successful encoding and maintenance of path integration information, with RSC selective for tasks that required processing heading rotation changes. These data indicate distinct working memory mechanisms for translation and rotation, which are essential for updating neural representations of current location. The results provide evidence that hippocampus, PHC, and RSC flexibly track task-relevant translation and rotation signals for path integration and could form the hub of a more distributed network supporting spatial navigation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{studies on}} the {{association}} between CD 14 - 159 C/T polymorphism and sepsis showed inconclusive results. Accordingly, we conducted a comprehensive literature search and a meta-analysis {{to determine whether the}} CD 14 - 159 C/T polymorphism conferred susceptibility to sepsis or was associated with increased risk of death from sepsis. METHODOLOGY: Data were collected from the following electronic databases: PubMed, Embase, Medline, Web of <b>Knowledge,</b> and HuGE <b>Navigator,</b> with the last report up to June 15, 2012. The odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) were used to assess the strength of association. We summarized the data on the association between CD 14 - 159 C/T polymorphism and sepsis in the overall population and subgroup by ethnicity and sepsis subtype. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 16 studies on sepsis morbidity (1369 cases and 2382 controls) and 4 studies on sepsis mortality (731 sepsis patients) met the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. Overall analysis showed no strong evidences of association with sepsis susceptibility under any genetic model. However, slight associations were found in Asian populations (dominant model: OR =  1. 38, 95 %CI =  0. 96 - 1. 98, P =  0. 08) and septic shock patients (dominant model: OR =  1. 72, 95 %CI 1. 05 - 2. 83, P =  0. 03; allelic model: OR =  1. 52, 95 %CI 1. 09 - 2. 12, P =  0. 01) in the stratified analysis. Moreover, there was borderline association between CD 14 - 159 C/T and sepsis mortality under the dominant genetic model (OR =  1. 44, 95 %CI =  0. 98 - 2. 11, P =  0. 06). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This meta-analysis suggests that the CD 14 - 159 C/T polymorphism may not be a significant susceptibility factor in the risk of sepsis and mortality. Only weak associations were observed in Asian populations and septic shock patients. More studies based on larger sample sizes and homogeneous sepsis patients are needed to confirm these findings...|$|R
40|$|Vehicle control may be {{considered}} as a hierarchically structured set of functions. Plan conception and plan selection activities are performed in the navigation function, verification and adjustment of the short-term voyage progress are performed in the guidance function, and typical closed-loop control activities are performed in the control function. Supervisory control of vehicles deals with automated vehicle control functions to a large extent. Nowadays, technology permits the typical control functions to be entirely executed by automated systems, while the navigation and guidance functions are still partially automated. The operator, who may observe the controlled process directly, acts as a manager who supervises the system and only interacts with the automperforming corrective actions. The human operator remains the primary responsible factor, specifying the constraints, and procedures in terms of setpoint changes for the automated system. It is known, however, that humans have certain limitations in supervising capabilities, particularly when slowly responding systems are concerned. Humans are not always able to anticipate, that is, to mentally predict future state information by applying knowledge of the goals, process characteristics and disturbances that act on the system, considering the current control actions and the observed changes in process state. Literature on human performance models indicates that accurate vehicle control mainly depends on the operator's knowledge of the controlled process characteristics and the route to be followed, on the ability to predict the future states of the controlled process, and on the quality of track planning and track following activities. A technical system g behaviour should provide information that addresses these elements. The current study focusses on the question what type of information is required to obtain accurate supervisory vehicle control. Five experiments were conducted in a man-in-the-loop simulator facility, where participating subjects were required to perform specific aircraft and ship control tasks, in routine and in non-routine task conditions, using different information systems. Task performance was measured and analysed with respect to accuracy of guidance and quality of navigation. The need of three information elements for accurate supervisory control was investigated: · preview information that enables immediate perception of the planned route, and assessment of future position error relative to that route · path prediction information, showing the predicted track ahead · capability prediction information, showing the predicted consequences of a range of process control actions with respect to the process states reaching their predetermined safety margins, thus indicating the boundaries of safe operation. The results of the experiments indicate that accurate supervisory vehicle control is obtained when information is provided containing the following complementary elements: · Capability prediction information, needed to support the navigator in the navigation function (knowledge-based behaviour), where non-routine task conditions occur. Capability prediction aids the mental process of generating alternative solutions for a problem situation. These alternatives are presented as an advise to the <b>navigator.</b> <b>Knowledge</b> of the safety margins allows navigators to properly re-plan the route by selecting the safest alternative. · Preview and path prediction information, needed to support accurate guidance along that alternative route (rule-based behaviour). During guidance, only routine task conditions exist. Navigators first roughly pre-set their controls based on preview and rules-of-thumb for creview and rules-of-thumb for control, then perform corrective setpoint control actions based on error information provided by the path predictor. It is suggested to apply {{the findings of this study}} for the guidance and navigation of high-speed craft. Because continuous observation of the outside world and of the controlled process state is required, it is advised to show prediction information as an overlay, superimposed over the external world scene, thus indicating where safe areas of navigation are located. The present study focussed on anticipation behaviour in guidance and control functions with a limited time horizon, for example, 5 to 10 times the time constant of the controlled process. Many navigation functions exist that encompass larger time horizons. In that case, more factors affect the controlled variables, requiring more knowledge based support. Additional research is needed to assess these longer term support systems more objectively. It is recommended to improve technology for prediction. For exaiction. For example, an extrapo-lator is relatively simple to implement because extrapolators operate on the basis of a limited quantity of sampled data. In practice, however, it is questionable whether sensors are capable to provide signals with sufficient stability and accuracy...|$|R
