As a co-ruler of Malamir, Isbul also financed the construction of a water conduit in the capital Pliska. As second-in-command, Isbul held <b>enormous</b> <b>power</b> and wealth, and was unusually often mentioned beside the name of the ruler in inscriptions. Due to his merits, Isbul has been described as an architect of medieval Bulgarian statehood by historians.|$|E
5|$|Some of the kingdoms paying {{tribute to}} the Tang dynasty {{included}} Kashmir, Nepal, Khotan, Kucha, Kashgar, Korea, Champa, and kingdoms located in Amu Darya and Syr Darya valley. Turkic nomads addressed the Emperor of Tang China as Tian Kehan. After the widespread Göktürk revolt of Shabolüe Khan (d. 658) was put down at Issyk Kul in 657 by Su Dingfang (591–667), Emperor Gaozong established several protectorates governed by a Protectorate General or Grand Protectorate General, which extended the Chinese sphere of influence as far as Herat in Western Afghanistan. Protectorate Generals were given {{a great deal of}} autonomy to handle local crises without waiting for central admission. After Xuanzong's reign, military governors (jiedushi) were given <b>enormous</b> <b>power,</b> including the ability to maintain their own armies, collect taxes, and pass their titles on hereditarily. This is commonly recognized as the beginning of the fall of Tang's central government.|$|E

25|$|In 1056, a Mon Theravada Buddhist monk named Shin Arahan made {{a fateful}} visit to Pagan, and {{converted}} its king Anawrahta to Theravada Buddhism {{from his native}} Ari Buddhism. The king had been dissatisfied with the <b>enormous</b> <b>power</b> of Ari monks over the people, and considered the monks, who ate evening meals, drank liquor, presided over animal sacrifices, and enjoyed a form of ius primae noctis, depraved.

25|$|By 1924, nearly 95% of all {{vineyard}} owners {{belonged to}} the KWV, allowing it to exert <b>enormous</b> <b>power</b> on the pricing structure {{and direction of the}} South African wine industry. The KWV was able to regulate planting rights for new vineyard properties, specify permitted grape varieties, limit harvest yields, regulate production methods and impose quotas on how much wine needed to be distilled for fortified wine production. While the activities of the KWV was able to stabilize the South African industry, it also stagnated the industry by limiting innovation and improvements in quality. This stagnation was compounded by the isolation South Africa experienced during the Apartheid era.|$|E

25|$|Eugene Debs {{formed the}} American Railway Union (ARU) as an {{industrial}} organization {{in response to}} craft limitations. Railroad engineers and firemen had called a strike, but other employees, particularly conductors who were organized into a different craft, did not join that strike. The conductors piloted scab engineers on the train routes, helping their employers to break the strike. In June 1894, the newly formed, industrially organized ARU voted to join in solidarity with an ongoing strike against the Pullman company. The sympathy strike demonstrated the <b>enormous</b> <b>power</b> of united action, yet resulted in a decisive government response to end the strike and destroy the union.|$|E
25|$|A {{proof of}} concept {{prototype}} was built with a 4.02inch (102mm) barrel, but otherwise was as intended. It was mostly automatic, and could be operated by a single person sitting in a covered control cabin on the right hand side of the vehicle. However, the <b>enormous</b> <b>power</b> and ammunition requirements for the piece resulted in it having to have two trailers in support - one for power, and one for ammunition - and a crew with a small crane in order to reload the two ammunition drums. With only 28 rounds available in the drums, and an 80-90 rounds/minute fire rate, reloading was a frequent task. It took a crew between ten and fifteen minutes to reload.|$|E
25|$|During 1945, in {{response}} to an approach made by the British Ministry of Supply, which had been seeking design submissions from aviation companies for an envisioned new long range civil flying boat, which was to operate in BOAC's fleet to operate its transatlantic passenger services, Saunders-Roe decided to submit a bid based upon the earlier collaborative design specification. Following evaluations of a range of different propulsion methods and configurations, the design team selected the in-development Bristol Proteus – one of the first turboprop engines – to meet the <b>enormous</b> <b>power</b> requirements of the proposed giant flying boat. In May 1946, the bid made by Saunders-Roe was selected as the winner, leading to the company receiving an order for the production of three SR.45 flying boats.|$|E

25|$|Emperor Xuanzong's reign {{ended with}} the Arab victory at Talas and the An Shi Rebellion, the first war inside China in over 120 years, led by a Sogdian general named An Lushan who used {{a large number of}} foreign troops. The Tang economy was devastated as the {{northern}} regions, the mainstay of economic activity, were destroyed. The cities of Luoyang and Chang'an were reduced to ruins. After the war, the Tang central government never recovered its former power, and local generals became independent of Tang rule. These generals wielded <b>enormous</b> <b>power,</b> passed on their titles by heredity, collected taxes, and raised their own armies. Although most of these jiedushi were quelled by the early 9th century, the jiedushi of Hebei, many of them former officers of An Lushan, retained their independence.|$|E
25|$|It was in {{this year}} that Enghien's father died, leaving him the fourth of his line and second of his name to bear the title Prince of Condé. He also now became premier prince du sang, {{addressed}} by everyone, from the king down, simply as Monsieur le prince. The <b>enormous</b> <b>power</b> that fell into his hands was naturally looked upon with serious alarm by the Regent and her minister. Condé's birth and military renown placed him {{at the head of}} the French nobility, but, added to that, the family of which he was now chief was both enormously rich and master of a large part of France. Condé himself held Burgundy, Berry and the marches of Lorraine, as well as other less important territory. His brother, the Prince de Conti held Champagne, and his brother-in-law, Longueville, Normandy.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there is}} {{disagreement}} {{about whether it}} marked a permanent change in values. Cowie and Salvatore in 2008 {{argued that it was}} a response to depression and did not mark a commitment to a welfare state because America has always been too individualistic. MacLean rejected the idea of a definitive political culture. She says they overemphasized individualism and ignored the <b>enormous</b> <b>power</b> that big capital wields, the Constitutional restraints on radicalism, and the role of racism, antifeminism, and homophobia. She warns that accepting Cowie and Salvatore's argument that conservatism's ascendancy is inevitable would dismay and discourage activists on the left. Klein responds that the New Deal did not die a natural death; it was killed off in the 1970s by a business coalition mobilized by such groups as the Business Roundtable, the Chamber of Commerce, trade organizations, conservative think tanks, and decades of sustained legal and political attacks.|$|E

25|$|King Charles II of Spain finally died on 1 November 1700. Louis XIV now faced {{a dilemma}} which he himself {{recognised}} as intractable. If he forbade the Duke of Anjou {{to accept the}} Spanish thrones and instead adhered to the Second Partition Treaty — which Leopold I had refused to sign and the Spanish had refused to recognise — Archduke Charles would almost certainly be acknowledged as the King of Spain and all its dominions, as stipulated in Charles II's last will {{in the event of}} refusal by the Duke of Anjou. The Austrian Habsburgs would accrue <b>enormous</b> <b>power</b> while France would gain nothing, and war with both Spain and Austria would be inevitable. Accepting the will of Charles II would also mean war with Leopold I, but in this case France would be allied with Spain defending rights recognised in the Spanish Monarchy. In any event the French king surmised that the Maritime Powers — anxious themselves for peace — would be either neutral or only half-heartedly involved, so long as the French and Spanish crowns were not united. With this reasoning, Louis XIV decided to accept Charles II's last testament, and sent his grandson to Madrid to reign there as King Philip V of Spain.|$|E

60|$|The {{history of}} nearly {{every country in}} Latin Christendom tells of the same phase in the {{eleventh}} century, a phase of struggle between monarch and Pope {{on the issue of}} investitures and generally it tells of a victory for the Pope.

With these two weapons it was possible for the twelfth century Popes to curb the most recalcitrant princes and overawe the most restive peoples. These were <b>enormous</b> <b>powers,</b> and <b>enormous</b> <b>powers</b> are only to be used on extraordinary occasions. The Popes used them at last with a frequency that staled their effect.
