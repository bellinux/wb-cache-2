25|$|Not only <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>necessary</b> for {{the body}} schema {{to be able to}} {{integrate}} and form a three-dimensional representation of the body, but it also {{plays an important role in}} tool use. Studies recording neuronal activity in the intraparietal cortex in macaques have shown that, with training, the macaque body schema updates to include tools, such as those used for reaching, into the body schema. In humans, body schema plays an important role in both simple and complex tool use, far beyond that of macaques. Extensive training is also not necessary for this integration.|$|E

2500|$|Lindbergh's {{reaction}} to Kristallnacht was entrusted to his diary: [...] "I {{do not understand}} these riots {{on the part of}} the Germans," [...] he wrote. [...] "It seems so contrary to their sense of order and intelligence. They have undoubtedly had a difficult 'Jewish problem', but why <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>necessary</b> to handle it so unreasonably?" [...] Lindbergh had planned to move to Berlin for the winter of 1938â€“39. He had provisionally found a house in Wannsee, but after Nazi friends discouraged him from leasing it because it had been formerly owned by Jews, it was recommended that he contact Albert Speer, who said he would build the Lindberghs a house anywhere they wanted. On the advice of his close friend, Alexis Carrel, he cancelled the trip.|$|E
2500|$|In the Journal of American Folklore, the {{sociologist}} Gary Alan Fine {{published a}} review of Magliocco's work in which he described it as [...] "a richly textured ethnography, as fine a participant-observation account of an American scene as folklore has been gifted with since Leslie Prosterman's Ordinary Life, Festival Days". Believing that Magliocco's analysis had revealed Paganism {{to be the most}} [...] "politically progressive and postmodern" [...] religion in existence [...] "despite [...] considerable borrowings of traditional themes", Fine felt that Witching Culture was [...] "an effective and affectionate guide in mapping the development of Neo-Paganism in America and the multiple [...] and occasionally conflicting [...] strains from which it draws". He did however note that in his opinion the author had failed to [...] "stand sufficiently back from the movement to gain the analytic purchase that comes from skepticism. Granted, all religions appear gawky in their adolescence, but sometimes disciplinary agnosticism permits us to discount desired but undeserved self-presentations. While no researcher should scorn the belief system of a group that she encounters, neither <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>necessary</b> to nuzzle. This attachment may cause Magliocco to downplay sexuality, drug use, and posturing in the community. These seekers often appear in her telling to be, frankly, rather puritanical." [...] He went on to remark that a [...] "more distanced view would emphasize the struggles over political correctness that challenge the movement as it staggers toward a consensual theology", in particular its controversial cultural borrowings from Native American cultures. Ultimately however, he felt that as an [...] "account of the folkloric practices of a burgeoning social scene", Witching Culture warrants [...] "high praise".|$|E
2500|$|The Massiah rule {{is also to}} be {{contrasted with}} the voluntariness {{standard}} of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The voluntariness standard applies to all police interrogations regardless of the custodial status of the suspect and {{regardless of whether the}} suspect has been formally charged. The remedy for a violation of the standard is complete suppression of the statement and any evidence derived from the statement. The statement cannot be used as either substantive evidence of guilt or to impeach the defendant's testimony. The reason for the strictness is the common law's aversion to the use of coerced confessions because of their inherent unreliability. Further the rights to be free from coerced confession cannot be waived nor <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>necessary</b> that the victim of coercive police conduct assert his right. In considering the voluntariness standard one must consider the Supreme Court's decision in Colorado v. Connelly. Although federal courts' application of the Connelly rule has been inconsistent and state courts have often failed to appreciate the consequences of the case, Connelly clearly marked a significant change in the application of the voluntariness standard. Before Connelly the test was whether the confession was voluntary considering the totality of the circumstances. [...] "Voluntary" [...] carried its everyday meaning - the confession had to be a product of the exercise of the defendant's free will rather than police coercion. After Connelly the totality of circumstances test is not even triggered unless the defendant can show coercive police conduct. Questions of free will and rational decision making are irrelevant to a due process claim unless police misconduct existed and a causal connection can be shown between the misconduct and the confession.|$|E
