5|$|Finally, Putnam's {{internal}} realism {{has been}} accused by Curtis Brown of being a disguised form of subjective idealism. If this is the case, it {{is subject to the}} traditional arguments against that position. In particular, <b>it</b> <b>falls</b> into the trap of solipsism. That is, if existence depends on experience, as subjective idealism maintains, and if one's consciousness were to stop existing, then the rest of the universe would stop existing as well.|$|E

5|$|Convective rain, or showery precipitation, occurs from {{convective}} clouds (e.g., cumulonimbus or cumulus congestus). <b>It</b> <b>falls</b> as showers with {{rapidly changing}} intensity. Convective precipitation falls over a certain {{area for a}} relatively short time, as convective clouds have limited horizontal extent. Most precipitation in the tropics appears to be convective; however, {{it has been suggested}} that stratiform precipitation also occurs. Graupel and hail indicate convection. In mid-latitudes, convective precipitation is intermittent and often associated with baroclinic boundaries such as cold fronts, squall lines, and warm fronts.|$|E

5|$|New Sleaford had {{a church}} and priest {{by the time of}} the Domesday Book (1086) and the vicarage was founded in 1274.

In 1616, the vicarage was valued at £8 and in 1872 at £180.

5|$|Pitru Paksha is {{considered}} by Hindus to be inauspicious, given the death rite performed during the ceremony, known as Shraddha or tarpan. In southern and western India, <b>it</b> <b>falls</b> in the 2nd paksha (forthnight) Hindu lunar month of Bhadrapada (September) and follows the forthnight immediately after the Ganesh festival. It begins on the Pratipada (first day of the forthnight) ending with the no moon day known as Sarvapitri amavasya, Pitru Amavasya, Peddala Amavasya, Mahalaya amavasya or simply Mahalaya. Most years, the autumnal equinox falls within this period, i.e. the Sun transitions from the northern to the southern hemisphere during this period. In North India and Nepal, and cultures following the purnimanta calendar or the solar calendar, this period may correspond to the waning fortnight of the luni-solar month Ashvin, instead of Bhadrapada.|$|E
5|$|Tameka Williams {{qualified}} {{to run in}} the 100 meter and 200 meter sprints. Williams, who would later compete in the 2016 Rio Olympics, was disqualified because she admitted that she used a banned substance. She voluntarily told her Olympic committee about using a banned substance, and it was announced on July 29 that she would not compete. Williams admitted to using a drug named Blast Off Red, which is typically used to enhance the performance of racehorses and greyhounds. Williams had posted on Facebook that she was innocent and had passed drug tests prior to the Olympics. While the drug is not listed as prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency, <b>it</b> <b>falls</b> into the category of veterinary medicine and therefore its use is not permitted.|$|E
