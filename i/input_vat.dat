From the perspective of government, however, VAT may be preferable because it captures {{at least some of the}} value added. For example, a building contractor may offer to provide services for cash (i.e. without a receipt, and without VAT) to a homeowner, who usually cannot claim <b>input</b> <b>VAT</b> back.

40|$|There {{has been}} a growing {{emphasis}} {{in many developing countries}} on export-led growth policies that attract both domestic and foreign investment into activities that will increase exports. Many countries, however, have not achieved the desired response. Among other problems, investors often face foreign exchange controls, tariffs on imported inputs, and a costly system for the exemption or refund of sales inflow of foreign investment and prevented the expansion of export production and sales. This paper addresses two issues related to the design and administration of the fiscal provisions that affect the competitiveness of country in the production of manufactured exports. The first issue is how to design a system that allows exporters to sell their output free of the burden of domestic sales taxes. The second issue is how to relieve exporters from the burden of import tariffs levied on inputs used in the production of exports. In this study, we also provide a synthesis of how a number of developing countries have tried to address these issues. We identify the elements of the administrative system needed to deliver effectively the <b>VAT</b> <b>input</b> tax credit refunds and to eliminate the burden of import duties on inputs used in exports.

40|$|Apportionment of <b>input</b> <b>VAT</b> and the {{mechanisms}} {{used to calculate}} apportionment have been a challenging issue {{since the inception of}} the Value-Added Tax Act No. 89 of 1991 in South Africa. This requirement to apportion <b>input</b> <b>VAT</b> has particular relevance to the retail industry due to the increase in the extension of credit which results in the receipt of taxable supplies (ordinary sales) and exempt supplies (interest income). As retailers are therefore making mixed supplies, they are required to apportion the <b>input</b> <b>VAT</b> paid on expenses.

40|$|M. Comm. VAT is a {{tax that}} is based on taxing the value added on {{successive}} transactions in the supply chain, accordingly it {{is a tax}} designed for the retail or manufacturing industries. South Africa introduced VAT that is similar to that introduced across the world and later refined it. The revisions included the introduction of VAT on banking services. The introduction of VAT to banking is a first in the VAT world but still does not find a cure for the principle dilemma of taxing a bank's value added, under VAT. The study therefore established if banks are treated fairly by investigating: • The three canons of taxation, • The eight principles on which VAT rests, • And the agreement between SARS and the Council of South African Banks. The reason of the above is to propose enhancements or an alternative design that would either increase the accuracy, equity, or simplify the calculation of VAT in the banking sector. The study found that there are several options when introducing VAT to the financial services sector, namely: • zero rate it and the fiscuss looses out on the output VAT, • tax it and increase the cost of borrowing as well as face the problems of determining the value added per transaction or; • exempt it and a practice known as cascading takes place. Neither of these solutions seemed viable although the full taxation option is conceptually the only correct method oftaxation. In most countries the exemption option was taken. The result of exempting interest is that banks have to apportion their <b>input</b> <b>VAT.</b> There are various options open to a bank when calculating the ratio of <b>input</b> <b>VAT</b> to be claimed, yet legislation has only made mention of two. To alleviate this situation the VAT authorities and the Council of South African Banks have agreed upon a methodology to calculate the ratio of <b>input</b> <b>VAT</b> to be reclaimed. This agreement is not compulsory and only applies to areas where the bank does not have an alternative apportionment technique, and in some instances is also flawed in its logic. Consequently banks have the option to apportion <b>input</b> <b>VAT</b> on what they perceive to be a fair basis. The indecision and inequities described above does not result an accurate VAT. The conclusion was that the design is urtiust and the practical calculation, when applied, does not the deliver the correct amount of tax payable. The study introduced a different form of VAT, named the Business Transfer Tax. This tax is an additive form of VAT, based on accounts that relate to interest and trading income. Interest income and trading income would be zero rated under the current VAT, and therefore entitle the bank to claim input tax incurred on expenditure. This would overcome all of the issues not resolved previously...|$|E
