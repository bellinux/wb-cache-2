25|$|The {{original}} railway station, named Bradford Exchange, {{was opened}} {{by the joint}} efforts of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway and the Great Northern Railway on 9 May 1850. In 1867, the Leeds, Bradford and Halifax Junction Railway, which had previously used Bradford Adolphus Street, built {{a link to the}} tracks into <b>Exchange</b> <b>station</b> to join the two existing companies; Adolphus Street station was then closed to passenger use.|$|E

The first <b>exchange</b> <b>station</b> would open in Quinta Normal after the Line 5 extension was finalised on 31 March 2004. However, the original plan to host a railway station would be discarded following the failure of the Melitrén construction.|$|E

25|$|By 1973, {{the railway}} station with its 10 {{platforms}} was deemed too large and was again rebuilt, {{this time on}} a different site slightly further south. The old <b>Exchange</b> <b>station</b> was demolished soon afterwards and was used for a time as a car park; the site now houses Bradford Crown Court and is due to be developed as a 'Justice Quarter' with new Magistrates' and Coroner's Courts. In 1977, a bus station was built alongside, and, in 1983, the station was renamed Bradford Interchange to link buses and trains in a covered environment.|$|E
25|$|The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway {{opened a}} station at Drake Street on 9 May 1850, between Manchester and Leeds. The Great Northern Railway opened a third {{terminus}} at Adolphus Street in 1854, but {{the station was}} {{too far from the}} centre, and the two companies built a joint station, Bradford Exchange which opened in 1867. Adolphus Street remained as a goods terminal. In 1973, <b>Exchange</b> <b>station</b> was rebuilt on a different site and in 1983 renamed Bradford Interchange and a bus station built alongside. Forster Square and Bradford Interchange stations are part of the West Yorkshire Metro.|$|E
500|$|Today I {{am afraid}} that fish in most of those rivers are {{virtually}} extinct. Anybody who stands today in the City of Manchester outside the <b>Exchange</b> <b>Station</b> and {{looks down at the}} noisome black water which flows beneath him would find it difficult to believe that any fish, or any other living creature, could ever have lived in what the Manchester Guardian has so rightly called that [...] "melancholy stream"... I have had my differences with the British Field Sports Society, but I have nothing but admiration for the excellent series of reports on river pollution which have been prepared for that Society... and ventured to suggest that they should make a similar survey of the Rivers Irwell and Roach. These two rivers were covered by the third report; and very sorry reading it made. There are two passages in that report which I should like to read. The first says: [...] "The banks are lined with factories, large and small, many of which take their water from the drainage of the hills forming the slopes of the river's valley, and discharge it as a polluted effluent, either into the small feeders, or the main river itself, so it may be said that no natural water normally enters the river from its cradle in the moors to its grave in the Manchester Ship Canal." [...] The second quotation is one which I find still more appalling than the first. It is: [...] "There are no fish in these rivers (apart from a very occasional tributary), no insects, no weeds, no life of any kind except sewage fungus, nothing but chemicals and any dirt which cannot be put to profitable use. Sewage effluents (and, being usually very good, they are the most encouraging feature of the appalling situation) are hailed with delight as being the purest water which the rivers hold." [...] The full importance of that statement will be realised when I remind hon. Members of the frequency with which residents in Bacup, Ramsbottom, Manchester and Salford are subjected to flooding from the waters of the Irwell.|$|E
