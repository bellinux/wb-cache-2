In September his duties as Vice-President of the British Association and interest in a paper on barnacles led him to attend their meeting at Birmingham, but he found it unpleasant and the excitement brought back the sickness. Even after a quick visit to Dr Gully and rest at home he took weeks to recover.|$|E
500|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler), Tom (Aziz Ansari) and Ben (Adam Scott) start {{promoting}} the upcoming Harvest Festival on several Pawnee media outlets, {{starting with the}} local morning zoo radio show [...] "Crazy Ira and The Douche" [...] (Matt Besser and Nick Kroll). [...] The duo begin asking Ben questions about his time as a teen mayor in Partridge, Minnesota, having researched how he bankrupted the town. Ben responds awkwardly, stammering incomprehensibly and unable to defend himself to Crazy Ira and The <b>Douche's</b> taunts. Tom proposes dumping Ben from future media interviews, but Leslie insists they cannot {{because he is the}} only one who can handle complicated questions about its budget. Meanwhile, April (Aubrey Plaza) accepts an offer from Chris (Rob Lowe) to move to Indianapolis to be his secretary. Andy (Chris Pratt) begs April to reconsider, offering to perform all the errands that she hates doing for a month. Ron (Nick Offerman) volunteers to help, claiming that he does not want to lose April as an assistant while denying he cares about April and Andy's relationship. Ann (Rashida Jones) is increasingly frustrated that Chris has not asked her about coming to Indianapolis with him, and is concerned about where their relationship is headed.|$|R
25|$|The {{general idea}} behind hydropathy during the 1800s {{was to be}} able to induce {{something}} called a crisis. The thinking was that water invaded any cracks, wounds, or imperfections in the skin, which were filled with impure fluids. health was considered to be the natural state of the body, and filling these spaces with pure water, would flush the impurities out, which would rise {{to the surface of the}} skin, producing pus. The event of this pus emerging was called a crisis, and was achieved through a multitude of methods. These methods included techniques such as sweating, the plunging bath, the half bath, the head bath, the sitting bath, and the <b>douche</b> bath. All of these were ways to gently expose the patient to cold water in different ways.|$|E
500|$|The only adult on {{the show}} that Stan {{consistently}} trusted was Chef, the cafeteria worker at his school, as Stan generally holds {{the rest of the}} show's adult population in low regard due to their tendency to both behave irrationally when subjected to the scams, cults, and sensationalized media stories of which he is often skeptical, and engage in hypocritical behavior. He doubts the legitimacy of holistic medicine, declares cults to be dangerous, and regards those claiming to be psychic mediums as frauds, specifically by declaring John Edward to be [...] "the biggest <b>douche</b> in the universe".|$|E
500|$|The writers {{planned for}} the ninth or tenth episode of the fourth season to focus on Miles's backstory; however, this was pushed back to the thirteenth episode of the fifth season {{as a result of}} the Writers Guild of America strike. [...] The revelation that Miles is Chang's son was not {{confirmed}} until Miles's flashback episode; however, this plot point had been speculated by the Internet fan community as early as Miles's first appearance on the show. [...] Further speculation occurred following the broadcast of the fifth-season premiere, in which Chang was seen tending to a baby boy. [...] This influenced the way that it was revealed in the show, as the writers looked for a way to present the information in a way that would both be interesting to those who had not guessed it and not insulting to viewers who had been predicting it. [...] What resulted was Miles and Hurley discussing Chang with Miles plainly saying, [...] "That <b>douche</b> is my dad" [...] before a cut to a commercial break.|$|E
500|$|In one scene, Leslie {{claims she}} unsuccessfully {{tried to contact}} Oprah Winfrey, the popular billionaire {{television}} host, to seek publicity for the harvest festival. Upon failing to contact Winfrey, Leslie said, [...] "I'm putting it out there, like The Secret, and hopefully she'll call me." [...] The Secret is a 2006 self-help book by Rhonda Byrne that became a best-seller after it was featured on two episodes of The Oprah Winfrey Show. At one point, Tom reveals he shops for clothes at Brooks Brothers Boys, the chain of Brooks Brothers that produces clothes specifically for young boys. Several Pawnee residents in [...] "Media Blitz" [...] refer to using the search engine AltaVista, a site {{that had not been}} popular for several years, prompting Ben to ask, [...] "Why does everyone in this town use AltaVista? Is it 1997?" [...] The radio DJs Crazy Ira and The <b>Douche</b> play several sound effects during their show, and when Ben acts awkwardly during the interview, they play the sound effect used when Pac-Man is killed in the maze arcade games.|$|E
500|$|... "The Duel" [...] {{was written}} by Jennifer Celotta, a {{producer}} and show runner with The Office. The episode featured {{the conclusion of the}} love triangle between Dwight, Andy and Angela, a subplot that had been going on since the fourth season finale, [...] "Goodbye, Toby". The cast and writing staff saw [...] "The Duel" [...] as a defining episode for Andy Bernard because it demonstrated a softer, more emotional side of the character. Dean Holland, who directed the episode, said this was particularly effective because in past episodes, he displayed such rage problems that he had to attend anger management courses, but in [...] "The Duel" [...] he responded to horrible news in a heartrending way. Rainn Wilson particularly praised Ed Helms' performance, saying, [...] "He gives a lot of heart and soul, and Andy is such a doofus and a <b>douche,</b> and now you really get to see his heart break. There's some reality there. That's the great thing this show gives us, just when you think you know the characters and they're two-dimensional and they're goofy and crazy, in their own way, you get real human redemption." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Media Blitz" [...] {{was written}} by Harris Wittels and {{directed}} by David Rogers. Like all of the first six third season episodes, it was written and filmed almost immediately after the second season ended {{as part of an}} early shooting schedule due to Amy Poehler's pregnancy. However, although finished early in anticipation of a September 2010 release date, Parks was ultimately placed on hiatus until early 2011, many months after production on [...] "Media Blitz" [...] was already finished. [...] "Media Blitz" [...] featured guest appearances by Matt Besser and Nick Kroll as, respectively, [...] "Crazy Ira and The Douche", the hosts of a Pawnee morning zoo-style radio show. Kroll is a stand-up comedian who had appeared in shows like Cavemen and The League, while Besser is a comedian from the Upright Citizens Brigade, a sketch comedy show and troupe which also featured Amy Poehler. Parks and Recreation co-creator Michael Schur said the <b>Douche</b> was invented because the Parks and Recreation staff liked Kroll and tried {{to find a way to}} work him into the show. The episode also featured several appearances by several frequent guest stars, including Mo Collins as television host Joan Callamezzo, Alison Becker as newspaper writer Shauna Malwae-Tweep, and Jay Jackson as television reporter Perd Hapley.|$|E
500|$|Time {{magazine}} writer James Poniewozik {{said the}} episode continued {{the development of}} the town of Pawnee, which he said was like a character itself and compared it to The Simpsons Springfield. Poniewozik said [...] "Media Blitz" [...] also showed how well integrated Scott has become with the cast, and called the [...] "Crazy Ira and The Douche" [...] interview [...] "maybe the most perfect scene P has put together yet". Likewise, Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club called Ben's interview with Perd Hapley [...] "one of the best scenes Parks & Rec has ever done". Heisler enjoyed how the series gradually built up Ben Wyatt's backstory throughout the season, [...] "then took it way over-the-top". However, he expressed disappointment that the Ann and Chris subplot ended with no resolution. Zap2it writer Rick Porter, called the episode a [...] "great showcase for Scott's deadpan gifts" [...] and wrote, [...] "This show hasn't had a real miss yet this season." [...] Porter said the April and Andy subplot was less interesting, but he enjoyed the scenes between Ron and Andy. Steve Kandell of New York magazine praised the episode for bringing Scott's character to the forefront, as well as for providing satire on small-town politics without coming across as preachy. Kandell said of the April and Andy story, [...] "If their kiss at the shoeshine stand, as expected and inevitable as it may have been, didn't make your heart soar just a little bit, then you're dead inside and probably just turned on NBC for Outsourced a few minutes early." [...] Joel Keller of TV Squad complimented Scott, calling him a [...] "current-generation Bob Newhart" [...] and [...] "one of those actors who can just give someone a look and it conveys {{everything you need to know}} about what his character is thinking". Keller said he also enjoyed seeing April and Andy reconcile, but felt the Crazy Ira and The <b>Douche</b> scene was ineffective because, regarding morning zoo radio shows, [...] "it's hard to parody something that's already a parody of itself".|$|E
500|$|In August 2013, Cyrus {{became the}} subject of {{widespread}} media attention and public scrutiny following a controversial performance and duet with Robin Thicke at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards at Barclays Center in New York City. The performance began with Cyrus performing [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] in bear-themed attire. Following this, Thicke entered the stage and Cyrus stripped down to a skin-colored two-piece outfit. Cyrus subsequently touched Thicke's crotch area with a giant foam finger and twerked against his crotch. An article published in The Hollywood Reporter described the performance as [...] "crass" [...] and [...] "reminiscent of a bad acid trip". The performance was described by XXL critic B. J. Steiner as a [...] "trainwreck in the classic sense of the word as the audience reaction seemed to be a mix of confusion, dismay and horror in a cocktail of embarrassment", while the BBC said Cyrus stole the show with a [...] "raunchy performance". The performance generated 306,100 tweets per minute on Twitter, breaking the record for the most tweeted-about event {{in the history of the}} social network; the previous record, held by the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show featuring Beyoncé, generated 268,000 tweets per minute. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone magazine recognized published a criticism of the presentation of Cyrus at the MTV Video Music Awards 2013, “It's Miley, Bitch: The Tongue That Licked the World”. The article praises the performance of the singer said: [...] " [...] Miley was the one star in the room who truly understood what the MTV Video Music Awards are all about — waggling your tongue, grabbing your crotch, rocking a foam finger, going to third with the Care Bears, twerking and shrieking and acting out America's goriest pop-psycho nightmares. She showed up Robin Thicke as one uptight <b>douche,</b> though he helped by dressing as the world's edgiest Foot Locker manager. Miley stole the night, which is why the nation is still in recovery today. Thanks, Miley." [...] According to Forbes, Cyrus' performance resulted in a gain of over 213,000 Twitter followers, 226,000 likes on Facebook, and 90,000 downloads of her new promotional single, [...] "Wrecking Ball", within days of the controversial performance. This amounted to a total 112% increase in Cyrus' social media activity.|$|E

2500|$|Many critics {{considered}} Max Greenfield the show's breakout star {{in season}} 1; The A.V. Club even named Greenfield's Schmidt [...] "the year's breakout TV character" [...] as a [...] "douchebag {{with a heart}} of gold". Salon described Schmidt as [...] "a sort of self-created alpha male {{and a collection of}} beta male qualities [...] are performed with such conviction they congeal into a sort of deranged machismo, one slathered in sandalwood-scented lotion. As part of this transition, Schmidt has gone from being a douchebag in the classic model — a guy who, in the pilot, constantly wanted to show off his pecs and scam girls, and seemed capable of doing so — to a <b>douche</b> of a more unique variety." [...] The Huffington Post Maureen Ryan said how [...] "Schmidt could have easily been 'the dumb guy', or the show could have exploited his status as an eminently mockable <b>douche.</b> But thanks to Max Greenfield's endearing depiction of the would-be ladykiller, there's a lot more the writers {{have been able to do}} with the character." [...] Caramanica lamented how Winston as the lone black character [...] "is still an outlier, though far less so than in the first season. He's a sharp foil when other characters, especially Schmidt, get too racially comfortable." ...|$|E
2500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} a C, stating [...] "I would {{have less of}} a problem with the typically shallow excuse for a plot if there was more funny material, but even by Family Guy standards, there wasn’t a whole lot in this episode". Kate Moon of TV Fanatic gave a 3/5 rating. She disliked the parts where Peter [...] " [...] acting like a <b>douche</b> to his friends", calling them [...] " [...] interesting enough to watch for 23 minutes". She also stated the episode would have [...] "vastly improved" [...] if the plot was on Brian and Stewie.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the {{assurances that}} DC Comics would not {{interfere}} with Moore and his work, they subsequently did so, angering him.

2500|$|The band's origins can {{be traced}} to an outfit formed by guitarist Dino Cazares—formerly of The <b>Douche</b> Lords—and drummer Raymond Herrera in Los Angeles, California. Their first lineup was {{completed}} with the addition of bassist Dave Gibney and vocalist Burton C. Bell (ex-Hate Face), who was allegedly recruited by an impressed Cazares, who overheard him singing [...] "New Year's Day" [...] by U2. Cazares played bass on the first three Fear Factory albums Concrete, Soul of a New Machine and Demanufacture, on which Cazares changed many of the riffs during the recording. It took Cazares two weeks to get the appropriate guitar tone. Cazares created, wrote and recorded all the music on the album. Wolbers joined the band two weeks before they were scheduled to go on tour to promote the album and, although he contributed musical changes to a couple of songs on the album he stated that these were not significant.|$|E
2500|$|The Royal National Lifeboat Institution's Torquay Lifeboat Station {{was at the}} Ladies Bathing Cove from 1876 until 1923.

Charles Dickens was said to have made readings there. In the 1900s a ballroom and a new sea water-filled swimming pool were built. The Marine Spa provided various therapies such as seaweed baths, needle, <b>douche</b> showers, hot and cold water baths and electric shock treatment.
