Shirley Halperin of Rolling Stone offered a mixed review by giving the album a three-star rating and saying [...] "Clarkson isn't ready for her new sound." [...] She asked, [...] "You can't <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>wonder,</b> Who is the real Kelly Clarkson, and when will she stop wearing her big sister's hand-me-downs?" [...] Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian gave it a two-star rating, saying that [...] "the title track expresses Clarkson's novel desire to [...] "spread my wings and learn to fly", but settles into a catchy enough rut at times." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{writer of}} Rap-Up {{magazine}} {{noted that the}} remix of the song which was featured on the mixtape Big R Ego was [...] "potent, but not quite fatal". Eskridge of Sister 2 Sister wrote in her review of the song that [...] "we can't <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>wonder</b> why {{it would have been}} cut". Matthew Richardson of Prefix Magazine noted, [...] "As far as songs that got left in the studio, 'Poison' actually isn't that bad. The song's production isn't loud enough for this to be a single, but Beyonce sounds fine here." [...] Nia Beckwith of the website AllHipHop gave a positive review about the song, saying that it was [...] "the most noteworthy" [...] track she heard during the week of its premiere.

500|$|Rick Ross drops by to say hi, {{keeping his}} {{appearance}} so brief that I can't <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>wonder</b> what he's even doing here. Justin Vernon inexplicably bookends the thing, pushing his falsetto into Antony range on the outro and muttering befuddling lyrics {{that have nothing}} to do with the rest of the song. All this over the straight-up funkiest beat Kanye West has made in years, a rippling electro push-pull that adds an effortless strut to his recent progged-out chilliness. But all that other stuff fades into the background when Nicki Minaj shows up. [...] She's a whirlwind of energy, showing her full repertoire of nutso voices and kicking the living fuck out of the beat, sounding like she's having an absolute blast the whole time." ...|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Cordelia is {{informed}} by Buddy the decorator crab and Lou the sawfish about Pi's upcoming battle with Troy. Nerissa reveals {{the story of his}} blue pearl to Pi and he gave it to his wife, but she got hooked in the open sea. Nerissa desperately tried to call for <b>help,</b> <b>but</b> no one was brave enough to <b>help.</b> Pi understands, <b>but</b> <b>wonders</b> how he can stop Troy for good; Nerissa tells him to offer Troy something he wants and then give him something he doesn't want. Cordelia finds Pi and repeatedly tries to convince him to reconsider, believing what's done is done. That night Pearl's pearl has been stolen by Troy's henchmen. She is heartbroken, being as Dylan's father gave her the pearl. Pi realizes that he cannot back down now no matter how much everyone else doubts him.|$|R
40|$|Foreword: In January of 1931, Warner Brothers-First National {{released}} a film entitled Little Caesar. Based {{on a book}} by W. R. Burnett, the movie, loosely portraying the life of Alphonse Capone, starred Edward G. Robinson in its title role, Caesar Enrico Bandello, also known as 2 ̆ 2 Little Caesar, 2 ̆ 2 or “Rico. ” Robinson, as he lies dying, utters {{one of the most}} famous end lines in film history: “Mother of Mercy–is this the end of Rico?” Likewise, no one who looks at this Symposium–or others 7 -or the seemingly inevitable march of RICO reform (chloroform?) legislation through Congress–or the endless efforts of the federal judiciary to narrow the statute–can <b>help</b> <b>but</b> endlessly <b>wonder,</b> “Is this the end of RICO?” This Symposium, with its wide-ranging lead articles and its craftsman-like student pieces, provides an excellent overview of the statute, and opinions for–and against–it...|$|R

500|$|In Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) he was Indiana Jones' greaser son Mutt Williams. His {{performance}} {{was met with}} mixed reviews with Todd Gilchrist of IGN commenting [...] "one can't quite <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>wonder</b> what Spielberg saw in the young actor that inspired him to cast LaBeouf". LaBeouf told the Los Angeles Times that he felt he as an actor [...] "dropped the ball" [...] on Jones' legacy, and [...] "there was a reason" [...] the film wasn't universally accepted. His next film was Eagle Eye, released on September 26. His performance received mixed reviews, with Josh Bell of Las Vegas Weekly saying he [...] "makes a credible bid for action-hero status, although his occasional stabs at emotional depth don't really go anywhere." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{announced}} on May 10, 1993 that The Who's Tommy had received eleven Tony Award nominations, tying with Kiss of the Spider Woman {{for the most}} nominations that year. Gaven received a nomination in the [...] "Best Featured Actress in a Musical" [...] category. However, {{as the result of}} an allergic reaction, she could not perform in the musical some nights. When Daryl Miller interviewed Gaven in the Los Angeles Times in 1997, he noted that [...] "this {{was one of the biggest}} disappointments of her life, and clouds cross her face for the first time in the conversation. She glances across the room at the Tony citation—recognizing her nomination for best featured actress in a musical—as she describes how her throat became infected due to a reaction to the oil in a haze-making compound that designers pump onstage to enhance lighting effects. She missed a lot of performances, and an untold number of Tony voters missed her performance. She can't <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>wonder</b> how that affected the outcome." [...] At one point, Gaven's understudy Alice Ripley took her place for eight consecutive weeks while Gaven recovered. Gaven eventually had to leave The Who's Tommy some months after it opened because of her allergy. She also disliked the idea of performing in one musical for more than a year.|$|E
500|$|Anton Chekhov in {{his plays}} The Seagull, Uncle Vanya and Three Sisters {{describes}} the tortured emotional states of doctors who {{at some point}} in their careers have turned their back on conscience. In his short stories, Chekhov also explored how people misunderstood the voice of a tortured conscience. A promiscuous student, for example, in The Fit describes it as a [...] "dull pain, indefinite, vague; it was like anguish and the most acute fear and despair... in his breast, under the heart" [...] and the young doctor examining the misunderstood agony of compassion experienced by the factory owner's daughter in From a Case Book calls it an [...] "unknown, mysterious power... in fact close at hand and watching him." [...] Characteristically, Chekhov's own conscience drove him on the long journey to Sakhalin to record and alleviate the harsh conditions of the prisoners at that remote outpost. As Irina Ratushinskaya writes in the introduction to that work: [...] "Abandoning everything, he travelled to the distant island of Sakhalin, the most feared place of exile and forced labour in Russia at that time. One cannot <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>wonder</b> why? Simply, because the lot of the people there was a bitter one, because nobody really knew about the lives and deaths of the exiles, because he felt that they stood in greater need of help that anyone else. A strange reason, maybe, but not for a writer who was the epitome of all the best traditions of a Russian man of letters. Russian literature has always focused on questions of conscience and was, therefore, a powerful force in the moulding of public opinion." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{strike and}} ensuing fire sale left fans in Montreal livid. The Expos {{finished}} {{last in the}} NL East in , and average game attendance fell by nearly 26%, from 24,543 to 18,189. [...] Interest in the Expos continued to decline {{in the years that}} followed; they would never draw more than 20,000 fans per game again during their tenure in Montreal. While noting the Atlanta Braves went on to win 11 consecutive NL East titles following the strike, Jonah Keri expressed the viewpoint of the fans as it related to Brochu and the team's owners: [...] "Expos fans couldn't <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>wonder</b> if that could have been them celebrating every year ... had Brochu convinced the team's cheapskate owners to spend a few damn dollars, or taken a leap of faith that short-term financial pain would lead to long-term success."

2500|$|Upon its release, Just Whitney {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics, with aggregated reviews on Metacritic awarding the album 53 out of 100. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic commented that Just Whitney was [...] "an assertion that she 's {{returning to her}} basics." [...] He {{also said that the}} album was a measured attempt to salvage a career that's on the verge of destruction. He concluded by saying, [...] "It would be a good standard-issue Whitney album if it wasn't for her disarming, defensive attempt to defuse every rumor hurled in her direction." [...] Billboard reviewed the album commenting that [...] "Just Whitney appears and sounds more like a work-in-progress than a finished disk" [...] and said that the album showcased an artist simply going through the motions and her voice lacked emotion and verve." [...] Steve Jones of USA Today graded the album two-and-half stars out of four, giving a mixed review saying, [...] "At her best, Houston is full of sass and attitude and, most of all, joy. But with so much emphasis on what's bothering her, you can't <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>wonder</b> whether the thrill is gone." [...] According to The Guardian, the album takes [...] "a musical step backwards".|$|E
2500|$|In a {{negative}} review, Flickering Myth critiqued that [...] "Some stories just don’t need telling, and Leatherface {{is one of}} them. It's not that it retcons elements of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre mythology, or that it's a 'pointless prequel' – it's just an empty movie. You'll have forgotten you've seen {{it as soon as}} the credits roll. Prequels, sequels and remakes can all enrich a story and tell it from a new perspective, but Leatherface just doesn’t do that."Screen International called the film [...] "a production line effort with an eye on cashflow rather than the demented work of art Hooper loosed on the world", stating [...] "this eighth entry is above average for its attenuated series. Gore levels are as high as expected and, naturally, the finale leaves things open for further installments." [...] Regarding the film's viewer appeal, HeyUGuys theorised, [...] "Not only is this prequel attempting to deliver something fans of the series don't necessarily want, it doesn't really do what it promises particularly well either. One for completists for sure, but on the whole Leatherface is too detached for TCM fans, and too extreme for the wider public." [...] William Bibbiani of IGN ranked it as the worst Texas Chainsaw Massacre film because [...] "it adds nothing new or interesting to the series. The problem is not just that this film is a prequel, so we know exactly where it’s going, but that the road to the inevitable takes us through almost unbearably familiar territory. It honestly looks as though the filmmakers who made Leatherface didn't watch the original films, but watched all of the films that ripped off The Texas Chain Saw Massacre instead." [...] Film critic Rob Gonsalves reviewed that [...] "Hooper's Chainsaw is often imitated, never duplicated (or bested, say I), a sui generis sweatbox odyssey that seems to owe nothing to any other film before it. Leatherface feels properly respectful, made by filmmakers who idolize the original, and that’s also its weakness: it's a jumped-up fan film, and because it's meant to be a prequel to Hooper's movie it's locked into whatever happens in that movie. It can't deviate from what we know, and can't truly surprise us." [...] Heather Wixson of Daily Dead went into Leatherface [...] "primed to love it", but felt that the final product [...] "never quite makes up its mind about just what kind of movie it wants to be, and suffers for its indecision. But as a whole, Leatherface is such a disappointing entry because it spends so much time trying to be so many other things than just a straight-up Texas Chainsaw movie, and I couldn't <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>wonder</b> why." [...] Wixson commended the cinematography, practical effects, and Lili Taylor's acting, but slammed the third act.|$|E
