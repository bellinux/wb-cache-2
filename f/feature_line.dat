40|$|AbstractSurface {{segmentation}} and edge <b>feature</b> <b>lines</b> extraction from fractured {{fragments of}} relics are essential steps for computer assisted restoration of fragmented relics. As these fragments were heavily eroded, it is a challenging work to segment surface and extract edge <b>feature</b> <b>lines.</b> This paper presents a novel method to segment surface and extract edge <b>feature</b> <b>lines</b> from triangular meshes of irregular fractured fragments. Firstly, a rough surface segmentation {{is accomplished by}} using a clustering algorithm based on the vertex normal vector. Secondly, in order to differentiate between original and fracture faces, a novel integral invariant is introduced to compute the surface roughness. Thirdly, an accurate surface segmentation is implemented by merging faces based on face normal vector and roughness. Finally, edge <b>feature</b> <b>lines</b> are extracted based on the surface segmentation.

40|$|Abstract. A crucial {{issue in}} dissimilarity-based {{classification}} {{is the choice}} of the representation set. In the small sample case, classifiers capable of a good generalization and the injection or addition of extra information allow to overcome the representational limitations. In this paper, we present a new approach for enriching dissimilarity representations. It is based on the concept of <b>feature</b> <b>lines</b> and consists in deriving a generalized version of the original dissimilarity representation by using <b>feature</b> <b>lines</b> as prototypes. We use a linear normal density-based classifier and the nearest neighbor rule, as well as two different methods for selecting prototypes: random choice and a length-based selection of the <b>feature</b> <b>lines.</b> An important observation is that just a few long <b>feature</b> <b>lines</b> are needed to obtain a significant improvement in performance over the other representation sets and classifiers. In general, the experiments show that this alternative representation is especially profitable for some correlated datasets...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Feature Flow Fields are a well-accepted {{approach}} for extracting and tracking features. In particular, {{they are often}} used to track critical points in time-dependent vector fields and to extract and track vortex core lines. The general idea is to extract the feature or its temporal evolution using a stream line integration in a derived vector field – the so-called Feature Flow Field (FFF). Hence, the desired <b>feature</b> <b>line</b> is a stream line of the FFF. As we will carefully analyze in this paper, the stream lines around this <b>feature</b> <b>line</b> may diverge from it. This creates an unstable situation: if the integration moves slightly off the <b>feature</b> <b>line</b> due to numerical errors, {{then it will be}} captured by the diverging neighborhood and carried away from the real <b>feature</b> <b>line.</b> The goal {{of this paper is to}} define a new FFF with the guarantee that the neighborhood of a <b>feature</b> <b>line</b> has always converging behavior. This way, we have an automatic correction of numerical errors: if the integration moves slightly off the <b>feature</b> <b>line,</b> it automatically moves back to it during the ongoing integration. This yields results which are an order of magnitude more accurate than the results from previous schemes. We present new stable FFF formulations for the main applications of tracking critical points and solving the Parallel Vectors operator. We apply our method to a number of data sets. ...|$|E

The derived FL can capture more variations of face images than the original points and thus expands {{the capacity of the}} available database.

Second, view-dependent lines better convey smooth surfaces.
