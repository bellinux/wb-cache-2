60|$|Besides these Pieridae, Mr. Bates found four true Papilios, seven Erycinidae, three Castnias (a genus of day-flying moths), and {{fourteen}} species of diurnal Bombycidae, all imitating some species of Heliconidae which inhabited the same district; {{and it is}} to be especially noted that none of these insects were so abundant as the Heliconidae they resembled, generally they were far less common, so that Mr. Bates estimated the proportion in some cases as not one to a thousand. Before giving an account of the numerous remarkable cases of mimicry {{in other parts of the}} world, and between various groups of insects and of higher animals, it will be well to <b>explain</b> <b>briefly</b> the use and purport of the phenomenon, and also the mode by which it has been brought about.|$|E

The end of the tapestry has been missing from time immemorial and the final titulus [...] "Et fuga verterunt Angli" [...] is said to be [...] "entirely spurious", added shortly before 1814 at a time of anti-English sentiment.

5000|$|Satisfactory {{accounts}} of general semantics extensional devices {{can be found}} easily. This article seeks to <b>explain</b> <b>briefly</b> only the [...] "indexing" [...] devices. Suppose you teach in a school or university. Students enter your classroom {{on the first day}} of a new term, and, if you identify these new students to a memory association retrieved by your brain, you under-engage your powers of observation and your cortex. Indexing makes explicit a differentiating of studentsthis term from studentsprior terms. You survey the new students, and indexing explicitly differentiates student1 from student2 from student3, etc. Suppose you recognize one student - call her Anna - from a prior course in which Anna either excelled or did poorly. Again, you escape identification by your indexed awareness that Annathis term, this course is different from Annathat term, that course. Not identifying, you both expand and sharpen your apprehension of [...] "students" [...] with an awareness rooted in fresh silent-level observations.|$|E
