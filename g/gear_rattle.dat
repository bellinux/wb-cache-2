The model uses oil films and elastic deformations {{directly in the}} multibody simulation, {{and is based on}} the Reynolds equation including squeeze and wedge terms as well as an elastic half-space. Two transient solutions to this problem, an analytical and a numerical one, were developed. The analytical solution is accomplished using assump-tions for the gap shape and the pressure {{in the middle of the}} gap. The numerical problem is solved using multilevel multi-integration algorithms. With this approach, tooth impacts during <b>gear</b> <b>rattling</b> as well as highly loaded power-transmitting gear contacts can be investigated and lubrication conditions like gap heights or type of friction may be deter-mined. The method was implemented in the multibody simulation environment SIMPACK. Therefore it is easy to transfer the developed element to other models and use it for a multitude of different engineering problems. A detailed three-dimensional elastic multi-body model of an experimental transmission is used to validate the developed method. Important values of the gear contact like normal and tangential forces, proportion of dry friction, and minimum gap heights are calculated and studied for different conditions. In addition, pressure distributions on tooth flanks as well as gap forms are determined based on the numerical solution method. Finally, the simulation approach is validated with measurements and shows good consistency. The simulation model is therefore capable of predicting transient gear contact under different operating conditions such as load vibra-tions or <b>gear</b> <b>rattling.</b> Simulations of complete transmissions are possible and therefore a direct determination of transmission vibration behavior and structure-borne noise as well as of forces and lubrication conditions can be done.

Different models and approaches to apply the path integration method are presented in Chapters 2 – 4.

In Chapter 2, the time-varying mesh stiffness is modeled as a constant plus a cosinusoidal component, and the discontinuous backlash nonlinearity is approximated with a cubic polynomial through curve fitting. Then Gaussian closure procedure is employed to obtain the mean and variance of transition probability density function (PDF).

Several details of the mechanism of gear lubrication are still in doubt in spite of many decades of study of this subject. The focus of our work is {{the investigation of the}} mechanism by which oil temperature variations affect <b>gear</b> idle <b>rattle,</b> which requires an understanding of the distributions of lubricant and heat within a gearbox. This paper presents the findings of a study of lubricant flow in a simple model gearbox by means of CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) and its validation by a series of tests on a spur gear rig. The commercial CFD code Fluent is used to simulate the splash flow of lubricant, using the techniques of dynamic meshing and VOF (Volume of Fluid). Our model takes into account the effects on the distribution of gear lubricant of lubricant level and physical properties as well as rotational speed. The results demonstrate that the flow patterns are strongly influenced by all these variables. The predictions are validated by high-speed flow visualisations using high-resolution imaging in conjunction with a pulsed Cu-vapour laser light source and powerful white light source.

The definitive version is available at: [URL] paper investigates automotive transmission <b>gear</b> <b>rattle.</b> Specifically, idle <b>gear</b> <b>rattle,</b> where the repetitive impacts of teeth are subject to light loads is investigated. Hydrodynamic regime of lubrication prevails in lightly loaded impact of teeth pairs. Formation of a lubricant film is due to the combined entraining motion of the lubricant and squeeze film effect. A lumped parameter inertial dynamic model, comprising hydrodynamic impact and flank friction for pairs of simultaneous teeth pairs of loose gears is developed. The overall dynamic model includes seven loose gear pairs and rigid body lateral motions of input and output transmission shafts. Therefore, the influence of fluid film behaviour on idle <b>gear</b> <b>rattle</b> is determined, which has hitherto not attracted sufficient research studies. <b>Gear</b> <b>rattle</b> is manifested by a vibration signature, which corresponds to the bands of frequencies due to torsional engine oscillations, meshing frequencies, and impact characteristics of lubricated conjunctions. The spectral contributions are affected by lubricant rheology, specifically its bulk viscosity variation with temperature. It has been found that spectral disposition tends towards lower frequency contributions with reducing lubricant viscosity because of rising temperatures and lowering lubricant stiffness. The findings conform with the experimental results, also reported in the paper.

40|$|Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. <b>Gear</b> <b>rattle</b> is caused by engine torsional vibration (engine order response) imparted to the transmission components, further causing the gears to oscillate within their functional backlashes. These oscillations lead to the repetitive impact of gear teeth, which lead to noisy responses, referred to as <b>gear</b> <b>rattle.</b> The lack of in-depth research into the effect of lubricant on <b>gear</b> <b>rattle</b> {{has been identified as}} a deficiency in the previous research in rattle. The aim ofthe current work is to address this shortcoming. The thesis outlines a new approach in investigating the problem of idle <b>gear</b> <b>rattle.</b> The approach {{is based on the assumption}} that under idling condition the teeth-pair impact loads are sufficiently low and the gear speeds are sufficiently high to permit the formation of a hydrodynamic lubricant film between the mating gear teeth. This film acts as a non-linear spring-damper that couples the driver and the driven gears. A torsional single-degree of freedom model is used in the development of the theory. The model is then expanded into a seven-degree of freedom torsional model and finally into an Il-degree of freedom model that also includes the lateral vibrations of the supporting shafts. The Il-degree of freedom model is based on a real life transmission that is also used in experimental studies to validate the model. It is found that lubricant viscosity and bearing clearance (lubricant resistance in squeeze) play important roles in determining the dynamics of the system and its propensity to rattle. At low temperatures, the lateral vibrations of the shafts, carrying the gears interfere with the gear teeth impact action. The severity of rattle is determined by the relationship between the entraining and squeeze film actions of the hydrodynamic film. When the latter dominates, the system can rattle more severely. The numerical results are found to correlate well with the experimental findings obtained from vehicle tests in a semi-anechoic chamber and also with those from a transmission test rig in the powertrain laboratory...|$|E

In this work, a new approach is presented for the localisation of impulse sources in complex structures, e. g. engines, driving units or complete vehicles. The approach is based on a correlation technique similar to methods used in radar techniques. The method is developed for an engineering application aiming on the detection of <b>gear</b> <b>rattle</b> in gearboxes. <b>Gear</b> <b>rattle</b> occurs in gearboxes and is caused by relative motion between acting gearwheels. <b>Gear</b> <b>rattle</b> depends on the play between the gearwheels, the loading and the overall dynamics of the system. <b>Gear</b> <b>rattle</b> can, under certain speed and loading conditions, dominate the total emitted noise from a truck. The proposed analysis method is based on the idea to measure impulse response functions (so called characteristic signals) from possible source locations to a receiving point {{on the surface of the}} structure, e. g. the casing of a gearbox. These characteristic signals are compared with vibration measurements when the analysis object is running and impulse sources are active (e. g. rattle impacts between cogwheels). The comparison is done by calculating the correlation coefficient between the characteristic signals and the measured vibrations in the receiving point. It is shown that this correlation coefficient corresponds to the maximum likelihood function and can, from defined perspectives, be seen as the best estimator to decide which of all possible sources is responsible for the vibrations in the receiving point. A substantial part of the work is devoted to the discussion of the quality of the decision based on the correlation coefficient. The problem is extended to the case of unknown arrival time and the presence of noise in the measured signals. From the theoretical background of the suggested methods, engineering solutions are suggested to handle the complex task to detect rattle source in gearbox under different driving conditions. The function of the method is demonstrated for both a modified gearbox under well-controlled conditions in a test rig and for a gearbox in a complete truck. It is shown that the method is a good tool for locating rattle sources in complex structures. It provides information concerning the location as well as the intensity of the impulse sources...|$|E

Analysis is performed by comparing three different lubrication conditions, and some of the classical wavelet functions adopted in literature are tested as "mother" wavelet. Moreover, comparisons with a metric based on the harmonic analysis by means of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), often adopted in this field, are conducted to put in evidence the advantages of the Wavelet technique with reference to the influence of some fundamental operative parameters. The experimental signals of the relative angular rotation of gear are acquired by two high resolution incremental encoders on a specific test rig for lightly loaded gears. The results of the proposed method appear optimistic also in the detection of defects that could produce little variations in the dynamic behavior of unloaded gears...|$|E
40|$|This is an {{open access}} article {{published}} by Elsevier under the CC BY license ([URL] paper introduces a novel analytical method for determination of gear airborne noise under lightly loaded conditions, often promoting <b>gear</b> <b>rattle</b> of loose unengaged gear pairs. The system examined comprises a single gear pair, modelled through integrated contact tribology and inertial transient dynamics. Lubricant film thickness, structural vibration and airborne gear noise are predicted and correlated with experimental measurements undertaken in a semi-anechoic environment. Good agreement is noticed between the numerical predictions and the experimental measurements. The presented model is capable of estimating the airborne radiated gear noise levels and the dynamic behaviour of gear pairs under different operating conditions, with superimposed impulsive input speed harmonics...|$|E

So design optimization of clutch system {{is very important to}} decrease rattle noise and need knowing clutch dynamic torque at real vehicle driving condition. This makes it possible to measure clutch dynamic torque by using a small-size magnetic sensor. We install a small-size magnetic sensor on the input shaft of the transmission and measure the relative angular displacement between clutch hub and disc plate. We can obtain the clutch torque correspond to the angular displacement in the clutch torsional characteristics test. The object of this research is to measure clutch dynamic torque on real vehicle condition. Therefore, Clutch dynamic torque is very useful for investigating operating range of clutch according to engine torque an...|$|E
40|$|To design new {{and high}} tech {{products}} the engineers rely {{more and more}} on computer based simulations to investigate the properties and behavior for a component or system. To verify these computer based simulations the dynamic properties for the components of the drivetrain needs to be verified. Therefore measurements of the stiffness and vibrations for the rear axle has been performed. This report show how the measurements has been implemented and evaluated, along with some interesting results for the rear axles properties. The static stiffness for the drive shaft along with the axle-gear has been determined. It is found that the stiffness for the whole rear axle is near the stiffness for the drive shaft, which means that the drive shaft becomes the dominant component of the system and affects the rear axle stiffness the most. The measured stiffness of the driveshaft is close to its theoretical stiffness. The stiffness for solely the hypoid-gear have been calculated using the stiffness for the rear axle and driveshaft, and thus has a range for the stiffness of the hypoid gear been determined. The backlash for the whole rear axle and for some individual components has been determined, where the backlash between pinion and crown-wheel has negligible impact on the total backlash. Measurements of the crown-wheel and pinion movements have been conducted, where the direction of movement is consistent with the theoretical direction of the forces. The vibration measurements show that the vibrations are more severe at certain rotational speeds. These vibrations can be due to the resonant frequency of the rear axle. An attempt to measure the <b>gear</b> <b>rattle</b> for the current rear axle has been conducted and the results for the measurements show a hint that <b>gear</b> <b>rattle</b> has occurred at certain speeds. The FFT-analysis shows that {{a large part of the}} vibrations is caused by the mesh-frequency and its orders. Validerat; 20140610 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E
40|$|<b>Gear</b> <b>rattle</b> of {{multi-step}} {{helical gear}} system is treated. Mesh stiffness variations and tooth profile errors are considered within the system. The effects of mesh stiffness variations, {{the ratio of}} static torque to dynamic one and tooth profile errors on the rattle are studied by a highly accurate numerical analysis called the shooting method. As a result, the followings were made clear. (1) Because of the tooth profile errors, the amplitude of resonances like gear noise becomes large and the vibration becomes chaos. These resonances are confirmed in some regions. (2) The phenomena which generate when the constant torque is smaller than the amplitude of variational torque in some extent {{are similar to those}} of single step gear system, the displacement amplitude of one-sided impact rattle is affected by tooth profile error, but that of both sides impact rattle is not affected so much...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{non-linear}} one-degree-of-freedom model {{for analysis of}} <b>gear</b> <b>rattle</b> vibrations in automotive manual transmissions is presented. In order {{to take into account}} the damping effects owing to the oil in the gap between two teeth of a meshing gear, a simple one-dimensional model for the oil-film squeeze effects is proposed. The squeeze model assumes that the damping force is proportional to the oil viscosity and to the extension of the oil film in the plane of curvature of the teeth, which may depend on the lubrication conditions (dry sump, splash, bath). The results provided from several numerical simulations, carried out with reference to helical involute tooth pairs, confirm the capability of oil in reducing the high-frequency vibrations subsequent to the impact between the teeth. In particular, the influence exerted by oil viscosity and gap extension on the rattle characteristics is investigated through the analysis of the transient response of the driven gear by imposing a harmonic motion to the driving gear...|$|E
