5000|$|The {{eldest of}} the eleven {{children}} of Dr. William Henry Twort, Frederick Twort was born in Camberley, Surrey on 22 October 1877. [...] The three eldest sons went to Tomlinson's Modern School in Woking. From 1894 Frederick studied medicine at St Thomas's Hospital, London. After qualifying in medicine (Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons, Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians) in 1900, Twort took the first paid post available, assistant to Dr. Louis Jenner, Superintendent of the Clinical Laboratory of St Thomas' Hospital. There he trained in pathological techniques. In 1902 he became assistant to the Bacteriologist of the London Hospital, Dr. William Bulloch, later F.R.S., and carried out single-handed the whole <b>diagnostic</b> <b>routine</b> of the Hospital. In 1909, Twort became the superintendent of the Brown Animal Sanatory Institution, a pathology research centre, and remained there {{for the duration of}} his career. In 1919 Twort married Dorothy Nony, daughter of Frederick J. Banister, and together they had three daughters and a son.|$|E
5000|$|The machine came {{standard}} with 64 KB RAM, {{with the}} equivalent of a built-in Apple Language Card in its circuitry, and had a new special [...] "Auxiliary slot" [...] (replacing slot 0, though electronically mapped to slot 3 for compatibility with earlier third-party 80-column cards) for adding more memory via bank-switching RAM cards. Through this slot it also includes built-in support for an 80-column text display on monitors (with the addition of a plug-in 1K memory card, via bank-switching of 40 columns) and could be easily doubled to 128 KB RAM by alternatively plugging in Apple's Extended 80-Column Text Card. As time progressed, even more memory could be added through third-party cards using the same bank-switching slot or, alternatively, general-purpose slot cards that addressed memory 1 byte at a time (i.e. Slinky RAM cards). A new ROM <b>diagnostic</b> <b>routine</b> could be invoked to test the motherboard for faults and also test its main bank of memory.|$|E
30|$|SMPISCS is the {{significant}} selfish behavior forecasting scheme proposed for sensor networks {{in order to}} ensure effective packet dissemination and co-operation degree for facilitating maximum network lifetime. SMPISCS make use of the characteristic features of Semi-Markov Chain for isolating selfish nodes from the network through the use of the probe <b>diagnostic</b> <b>routine.</b> The probe <b>diagnostic</b> <b>routine</b> is efficient enough in converging the Semi-Markov process of detection to a Semi-Markov Chain as the interval of detecting selfishness behavior is not necessarily exponentially distributed. The probe <b>diagnostic</b> <b>routine</b> is potential in transmitting the probe packets to all the interacting sensor nodes of the network with a threshold diagnostic time. This transmission of probe packets is responsible for estimating the probable transition probability of sensor nodes in the network at each and every instant of time. The number of probe packets and time of transmitting probe packets is uniformly distributed with a lower and upper limit of 0 and T respectively. This problem of selfishness identification considers an average diagnostic time under the uniform distribution for ensuring rapid detection of intentionally behaving selfish sensor nodes.|$|E
