In other words, under such conditions the material costs, labor costs, and a pro rata share of the factory overhead are all charged to definite factory orders, and the elements of material, labor, and overhead costs are compiled so that the total factory cost of each individual order may be determined. If a number of units are manufactured under the definite factory order, the unit article cost may be determined by dividing the total factory cost by the total quantity manufactured or produced. Definite factory orders may be issued for the manufacture {{of a number of}} units, for a single unit, or for the manufacture of certain parts of a unit.|$|E
60|$|Cost of Production {{consists}} of several elements, {{some of which}} are constant and universal, others occasional. The universal <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> of production are the wages of the labor, and the profits of the capital. The occasional elements are taxes, and any extra cost occasioned by a scarcity value of some of the requisites. Besides the natural and necessary elements in cost of production—labor and profits—there are others which are artificial and casual, as, for instance, a tax. The taxes on hops and malt are {{as much a part of}} the cost of production of those articles as the wages of the laborers. The expenses which the law imposes, as well as those which the nature of things imposes, must be reimbursed with the ordinary profit from the value of the produce, or the things will not continue to be produced. But the influence of taxation on value is subject to the same conditions as the influence of wages and of profits. It is not general taxation, but differential taxation, that produces the effect. If all productions were taxed so as to take an equal percentage from all profits, relative values would be in no way disturbed. If only a few commodities were taxed, their value would rise; and if only a few were left untaxed, their value would fall.|$|E
60|$|The {{component}} <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>Cost</b> of Production {{have been}} {{set forth in the}} First Part of this inquiry.(214) The principal of them, and so much the principal as to be nearly the sole, was found to be Labor. What the production of a thing costs to its producer, or its series of producers, is the labor expended in producing it. If we consider as the producer the capitalist who makes the advances, the word Labor may be replaced by the word Wages: what the produce costs to him, is the wages which he has had to pay. At the first glance, indeed, this seems to be only a part of his outlay, since he has not only paid wages to laborers, but has likewise provided them with tools, materials, and perhaps buildings. These tools, materials, and buildings, however, were produced by labor and capital; and their value, like that of the article to the production of which they are subservient, depends on cost of production, which again is resolvable into labor. The cost of production of broadcloth does not wholly consist in the wages of weavers; which alone are directly paid by the cloth-manufacturer. It consists also of the wages of spinners and wool-combers, and, it may be added, of shepherds, all of which the clothier has paid for in the price of yarn. It consists, too, of the wages of builders and brick-makers, which he has reimbursed in the contract price of erecting his factory. It partly consists of the wages of machine-makers, iron-founders, and miners. And to these must be added the wages of the carriers who transported any of the means and appliances of the production to the place where they were to be used, and the product itself to the place where it is to be sold.|$|E

50|$|Cairnes' {{analysis}} of {{cost of production}} in its relation to value: According to Mill, the universal elements in cost of production are the wages of labour and the profits of capital. To this theory Cairnes objects that wages, being remuneration, can in no sense be considered as cost, and could only {{have come to be}} regarded as cost in consequence of the whole problem being treated {{from the point of view}} of the capitalist, to whom, no doubt, the wages paid represent cost. The real <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> of production he looks upon as labour, abstinence and risk, the second of these falling mainly, though not necessarily, upon the capitalist. In this analysis he to a considerable extent follows and improves upon Nassau William Senior, who had previously defined cost of production as the sum of the labour and abstinence necessary to production.|$|E
40|$|If {{the cost}} {{decrease}} is {{a target of}} technological progress, one of the progress assessments {{is a change in}} the cost structure. It is due to the uneven impact of new technologies on different <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> product <b>costs.</b> Hence it is possible to determine three types of technological progress: labor saving, fixed capital saving and material saving. In reality, any new technology or technological progress as a whole changes all the three <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs,</b> but historically it is possible to determine the periods when one of them dominated. The reasons of such an uneven influence are the dynamics of relative prices of each resource, on the demand side, and the objective dynamic possibilities of scientific and technological development...|$|R

40|$|In Malaysian {{construction}} industry, one of {{the conditions}} in the contract made between the employer and contractor is to complete a project within a specified time. Failure to fulfil the condition will amount to breach of contract. Main remedy available for breach of contract is an award of damages. Damages are a reasonable sum of money awarded as compensation to the innocent party and {{one of the}} damages available is liquidated damages. It is a genuine pre-estimate amount and provided not to penalise the party at fault. A building owner will want to claim as much as he can to cover the loss resulted from the delay of completion. The objectives of this research are to identify the basis in ascertaining the amount of liquidated damages and ascertain whether the amount of liquidated damages is a reasonable compensation or not. There are <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> from nine articles tabulated in a table to create a basis in ascertaining the liquidated damages amount. Twenty <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>cost</b> found and they were divided into major and minor costs. There are seven elements under the major cost and the rest were classified as minor cost. The major costs are financing interest, loss of profit, professional fee, administrative cost, alternative facilities, supervision fees and overhead. Three public projects and two private projects were analysed to ascertain whether the amount of liquidated damages were reasonable or not. As a result, the amount of liquidated damages in public project appears to be reasonable as it is less than the amount of losses suffered. In private projects, the amount of liquidated damages is unreasonable as the amount is more than the losses suffered and can be challenged as penalty by the contractor...|$|E
