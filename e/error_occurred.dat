5|$|The Hello Pappy scandal, {{alluding}} to the nickname of involved host Willie Revillame and the Hello Garci scandal, was a scandal surrounding an incident during the August 20, 2007 episode of the Filipino variety show Wowowee, broadcast by ABS-CBN. During the episode, a technical <b>error</b> <b>occurred</b> during the final jackpot round of the show's Wilyonaryo segment which raised allegations within the media that the segment was, or could be, rigged by the producers. The incident prompted {{an investigation by the}} country's Department of Trade and Industry, and was also the catalyst of an on-air feud between Revillame and Joey de Leon, a personality from the rival GMA Network.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant-Colonel Otway, {{who wrote}} an {{official}} {{history of the}} British airborne forces during World War II, stated that Operation Varsity highlighted the vulnerability of glider-borne units. While they arrived in complete sub-units {{and were able to}} move off more quickly than airborne troops dropped by parachute, the gliders were easy targets for anti-aircraft fire and short-range small-arms fire once landed; Otway concluded that in any future operations, troops dropped by parachute should secure landing zones prior to the arrival of glider-borne units. Thus, by having the landings conducted during daylight to ensure greater accuracy, the Allied planners incurred a far greater casualty rate, particularly amongst the glider-borne elements. The operation also suffered from poor piloting. Although the piloting was of a better quality than in the Sicilian and Normandy operations, there were still significant failures {{on the part of the}} pilots, especially when it is considered that the drop was conducted in daylight. A significant <b>error</b> <b>occurred</b> when the pilots of the transports carrying 513th Parachute Infantry Regiment dropped much of the regiment several miles from their designated drop zones, with the mis-dropped units actually landing in the British landing zones.|$|E

50|$|Dies must be {{properly}} aligned in presses for coins {{to be struck}} correctly. <b>Errors</b> <b>occur</b> when dies are offset, tilted, or rotated. Offset <b>errors</b> <b>occur</b> when the hammer die is not centered over the anvil die typically resulting in an off-centered obverse, but centered reverse. Tilting <b>errors</b> <b>occur</b> when die surfaces are not parallel producing coins that are thinner along one edge, and sometimes causing missing design elements along the opposite edge because of insufficient pressure being exerted on that edge. Rotation <b>errors</b> <b>occur</b> when the images on the obverse and reverse dies are turned from the normal positions such as when the reverse image is at a right angle to the obverse.|$|R

25|$|The {{accident}} was caused {{through a series}} of events which, although not in themselves sufficient to cause the crash, combined to create a breakdown in crew resource management. The flight experienced two delays (deicing at Seattle–Tacoma and holding at Bakersfield), which along with wind speeds increased the flight time by nearly three hours. This caused the captain to consider diverting to Las Vegas. The first pilot <b>error</b> <b>occurred</b> when the first officer incorrectly set his altimeter when the descent started.

25|$|Far {{ahead of}} the 1955 doubled die cent in rarity, the 1943 copper cent {{is one of the}} notable rarities of the Lincoln cent series. An {{estimated}} 40 examples are believed to have been struck, with 12 confirmed to exist. The <b>error</b> <b>occurred</b> when copper planchets were left in the press hopper and press machines during the changeover from copper to steel blanks. Examples were discovered after the War, with the first two in 1947, and another in 1958. An example was first sold in 1958 for $40,000; one mint condition specimen sold for over $200,000 in 2004. Many people have counterfeited the coin by either copper-plating normal 1943 cents (sometimes as novelties with no intent to defraud), or altering cents from the period, usually 1945-, 1948-, or 1949-dated coins.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, a hubbing error {{caused some}} cents to get struck with an obverse die which showed {{doubling}} {{in all of}} the obverse devices, producing a prominent doubling of the date, and to a less noticeable degree, the rest of the obverse. This is known as the 1955 doubled die cent. A similar die <b>error</b> <b>occurred</b> in 1969 on dies used at the San Francisco Mint. While the 1955 doubled die cent is well-known and widely collected, the 1969-S doubled die is far rarer, with an uncirculated specimen selling for as much as $126,500 in a 2008 Heritage auction. The same mechanism produced 1972, 1983, 1984, and 1995 Doubled die cents. Doubled Dies are known for practically every date in the Lincoln cent series, but most are minor, and less impressive compared to the 1955 and the other Doubled Die varieties mentioned here.|$|E
25|$|The four {{remaining}} British battlecruisers {{were still}} ahead of Evan-Thomas' 5th BS when first contact {{was made with}} the HSF. Beatty ordered a reversal of course, now attempting to lead the German fleet northwards towards the British Grand Fleet. At this point a second signalling <b>error</b> <b>occurred</b> with flag signals sent to the 5th BS ordering it also to turn about. A signal was raised by Lion and seen by Barham as it steamed past the now retreating Lion in the opposite direction. However, the signal was not lowered (which was {{the point at which}} {{it was supposed to be}} carried out) until the battleships were dangerously close to the German fleet and under heavy fire, and then the order was to 'turn in succession'. This means each ship turns as it reaches exactly the same spot in the ocean, and in this situation marked out a perfect target area upon which the German fleet could aim as each British ship passed through it in turn. The last ship, Malaya, seeing the firefight ahead turned early.|$|E

25|$|Visual Studio Ultimate 2010 also {{includes}} a historical debugger for managed code called IntelliTrace. Unlike a traditional debugger that records only the currently active stack, IntelliTrace records all events, such as prior function calls, method parameters, events and exceptions. This allows the code execution to be rewound in case a breakpoint was not set where the <b>error</b> <b>occurred.</b> Debugging with IntelliTrace causes the application to run more slowly than debugging without it, and uses more memory as additional data needs to be recorded. Microsoft allows configuration of how much data should be recorded, in effect, allowing developers to balance the speed of execution and resource usage. The Lab Management component of Visual Studio Ultimate 2010 uses virtualization to create a similar execution environment for testers and developers. The virtual machines are tagged with checkpoints which can later be investigated for issues, {{as well as to}} reproduce the issue. Visual Studio Ultimate 2010 {{also includes}} the capability to record test runs that capture the specific state of the operating environment as well as the precise steps used to run the test. These steps can then be played back to reproduce issues.|$|E

500|$|Since {{the early}} 20th century, controversies have arisen {{regarding}} {{the accuracy of}} the monument's placement. After the initial surveys, {{it was found that the}} borders did not always follow the lines of meridian and parallel (as they had been intended to) due to the primitive surveying technology available at the time of construction. This discrepancy left the four states asking if the correct borders were the exact lines of meridian and parallel (and if new, more accurate, surveys needed to be done), or if the markers placed during the initial surveys were now the actual border. The issue was resolved when New Mexico sued Colorado in 1919, and in 1925 the Supreme Court ruled that the markers placed during the initial surveys were the actual borders, even if the markers were off in some locations (this includes the Four Corners Monument). Today's legal description of these border lines is based on the original markers, and not the written description of the borders created when the territories were formed. Because of this, the borders between these states are not perfectly straight and often zigzag. One example is the border between Colorado and Utah, where in one area the border jogs west about [...] from where it was intended to be placed (...) [...] Because this <b>error</b> <b>occurred</b> in the original survey—which superseded the written description (being simply the 32nd meridian west of Washington), the border set out by the markers remains the border between the two states.|$|E

Rutter and Jennings gave the correct response of Chicago, but Watson's response was [...] "What is Toronto?????"

Dr. Chris Welty, who also worked on Watson, suggested that {{it may not have been}} able to correctly parse the second part of the clue, [...] "its second largest, for a World War II battle" [...] (which was not a standalone clause despite it following a semicolon, and required context to understand that it was referring to a second-largest airport). Eric Nyberg, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and a member of the development team, stated that the <b>error</b> <b>occurred</b> because Watson does not possess the comparative knowledge to discard that potential response as not viable. Although not displayed to the audience as with non-Final Jeopardy! questions, Watson's second choice was Chicago. Both Toronto and Chicago were well below Watson's confidence threshold, at 14% and 11% respectively.
