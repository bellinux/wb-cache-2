40|$|One of {{the most}} {{commonly}} utilised methods of diagnosing surface wave plasmas in recent years has involved the measurement of the electric fields surrounding the plasma column. However, such work has almost exclusively been confined to plasmas with generating frequencies typically greater than 200 MHz. The research reported in this thesis represents the first systematic diagnostic investigation of low <b>frequency</b> <b>surface</b> wave plasmas. Three distinct diagnostic methods are employed which have been developed specifically to facilitate the diagnosis of low <b>frequency</b> <b>surface</b> wave plasmas. Each diagnostic technique is comprised of a two-stage process. The first stage involves the measurement of the electric fields surrounding the plasma, from which point determinations of the surface wave wave number are obtained. In the second stage, an axial plasma density gradient is inferred from the wave number values using a theoretical surface wave model. The thesis begins with a general introduction to the characteristics of surface wave plasmas and details the principle research objectives in the present investigation. Previous work in related areas is reviewed and its relevance to the present study highlighted. The equipment employed for the experimental part of the research programme is discussed in detail. The theoretical surface wave model is then developed which serves to interpret the experimental measurements. The design of the Axial and FRD diagnostic techniques is described together with their application for diagnosing the low <b>frequency</b> <b>surface</b> wave plasmas. A new diagnostic tool; the parasitic test-wave technique; has been developed and the results from which serve to validate the data from the Axial and FRD techniques.

40|$|Reconfigurable antennas have {{recently}} formed a popular research topic. They are attracting {{the interest of}} many industry professionals. This is basically due to the growing demands for more functionality while occupying the same or even smaller physical volume. Using various antennas for wireless applications is no longer effective because having several antennas take too much space. Reconfigurable antennas are the best solution to provide a better performance in terms of flexibility, efficiency and combination of several electromagnetic spectrum applications. <b>Frequency</b> selective <b>surfaces</b> are exploited in many communication applications, especially in designing reconfigurable antennas due {{to their ability to}} control the electromagnetic field. A <b>frequency</b> selective <b>surface</b> is an important figure concept in reconfigurable antenna structures and has developed rapidly due to their unique properties in suppressing the surface wave propagation. The main topic of this research is to design new reconfigurable radiation pattern antennas with enhanced performance by using switchable <b>frequency</b> selective <b>surfaces.</b> The antenna consists of a central radiating source surrounded by switchable <b>frequency</b> selective <b>surface</b> unit cells to give the antenna beam, shaping capability to scan 360 degree in the azimuth plane. Novel switchable <b>frequency</b> selective <b>surface</b> unit cells with various structures are designed and their characteristics are compared in both the reflective and transparent states. The reconfigurable response is the basic concept in the antenna design. This is achieved by adding PIN diodes to the lines that will connect or disconnect the unit cells and transform the <b>frequency</b> selective <b>surface</b> to be either a reflective or a transparent surface. As a consequence, switching the <b>frequency</b> selective <b>surface</b> PIN diodes leads to control the antenna beam direction. In this thesis, two novel reconfigurable antennas with <b>frequency</b> selective <b>surface</b> unit cells are presented, each antenna works at a different frequency band.

The research topic in this thesis includes investigations and techniques to increase the bandwidth and improve the radiation characteristics of the reconfigurable antennas by using new switchable <b>frequency</b> selective <b>surface</b> unit cells. Experimental results show the preference of the proposed antennas over those presented in the literature. Thus, two new reconfigurable antennas are implemented and their enhanced performances in terms of bandwidth are proven...|$|R
