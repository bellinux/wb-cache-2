500|$|<b>In</b> 1962, <b>the</b> <b>Nixons</b> {{embarked}} on another campaign, {{this time for}} Governor of California. Prior to Richard Nixon's announcement of his candidacy, Pat's brother Tom Ryan said, [...] "Pat {{told me that if}} Dick ran for governor she was going to take her shoe to him." [...] She eventually agreed to another run, citing that it meant a great deal to her husband, but Richard <b>Nixon</b> lost <b>the</b> gubernatorial election to Pat Brown.|$|R

25|$|Mardian became {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> administration's unorthodox campaigns early when he headed the federal prosecution of Pentagon Papers leaker Daniel Ellsberg in 1971. Although {{passed over for}} the appointment as deputy manager of CRP, Mardian was appointed as a 'political coordinator' with an uncertain role, as well as counsel for the committee.|$|E
25|$|In February 2005, reports {{surfaced}} that Woodward {{had prepared}} Deep Throat's obituary {{because he was}} near death. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist was battling cancer at the time (he would die in September 2005), and the rumors led to speculation that Rehnquist might have been Deep Throat. Rehnquist was a Justice Department official early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> administration and was an associate justice of the Supreme Court at the time Deep Throat was active.|$|E
25|$|His {{work on the}} 1968 {{campaign}} led to Mardian becoming {{close to}} John N. Mitchell, {{in charge of the}} campaign overall. Mardian was appointed as general counsel to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> administration. He supported Mitchell's 'Southern strategy' and advised the Department on ways of easing the pace of school integration. His success in this post led to a promotion as Assistant Attorney General under Mitchell.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Nixon was disbarred by the New York State Bar Association for {{obstruction}} of justice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Watergate affair. <b>Nixon</b> chose not to present any defense.|$|R
50|$|Charles Duane Baker III (born June 21, 1928) is an American {{businessman}} and former U.S. government official.

He became {{the head of the}} Governmental Affairs office of the J. C. Penney Company in 1965 but {{resigned}} from Penney's to accept an appointment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> Administration, as Director of Congressional Affairs in the United States Department of Transportation. He held this position through 1969 and 1970, leaving in 1971 to purchase the Robert Mullen Company, a Washington, D.C. public-relations company.|$|E
25|$|Egale {{successfully}} lobbied {{the federal}} government to add “sexual orientation” to the Canadian Human Rights Act to protect lesbians, gays and bisexuals from discrimination; lent support to many provincial and territorial efforts to have equal rights enshrined in legislation across the country; lobbied the Government to introduce more severe penalties for those convicted of gay-bashing and other hate crimes; supported the addition of “sexual orientation” to the grounds covered by hate propaganda legislation; intervened <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> case to support the rights of transgender people.|$|E
25|$|United States Secretary of Transportation Claude Brinegar often criticized Butterfield {{for being}} lax on {{aviation}} safety, allegations Butterfield strongly denied. In early January 1975, President Gerald Ford {{asked for the}} resignation of all executive branch officeholders who had been prominent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> administration. The Washington Post, quoting anonymous White House sources, said Butterfield's dismissal was not retaliation {{for his role in}} revealing the White House taping system, and allowed Butterfield to make a case for keeping his job with new White House Chief of Staff Donald Rumsfeld.|$|E
25|$|When Marjory Stoneman Douglas {{first began}} the organization, Friends, {{along with the}} work of other {{individual}} activists, was instrumental <b>in</b> persuading <b>the</b> Richard <b>Nixon</b> administration to stop the development of the Miami International Airport <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Everglades.|$|R
25|$|The London Gold Pool {{controls}} were followed {{with an effort}} to suppress the gold price with a two-tier system of official exchange and open market transactions, but this gold window collapsed <b>in</b> 1971 with <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> Shock, and resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> onset of the gold bull market which saw {{the price of gold}} appreciate rapidly to US$850 in 1980.|$|R
500|$|Nixon, {{continuing}} to ask skeptical rhetorical questions, indicated that some might feel {{that even with}} the opinions, he might have found some way to personally benefit. In response to his own question, the senator detailed his background and financial situation, beginning with his birth in Yorba Linda, and the family grocery store <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> boys helped out. He alluded to his work in college and law school, his service record, and stated {{that at the end}} of the war, he and Pat Nixon had $10,000 in savings, all of it patriotically <b>in</b> government bonds. <b>The</b> candidate gave the dollar amounts of small inheritances that <b>the</b> <b>Nixons</b> had received from relatives, before turning to their life in Washington: ...|$|R
25|$|The {{company has}} had {{as part of}} its management, and on its Board of Directors, many well known ex-government {{personnel}} including Melvin Laird, Secretary of Defense <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> administration; William Perry, Secretary of Defense for Bill Clinton; John M. Deutch, President Clinton's CIA Director; Admiral Bobby Ray Inman who served in various capacities in the NSA and CIA for the Ford, Carter and Reagan administrations; and David Kay who led the search {{for weapons of mass destruction}} after the 1991 Gulf War and served under the Bush Administration after the 2003 Iraq invasion.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, Hersh {{was hired}} as a {{reporter}} for the Washington bureau of The New York Times, where he served from 1972 to 1975 and again in 1979. Hersh reported on the Watergate scandal, though most of the credit for that story went to Carl Bernstein and Hersh's longtime rival Bob Woodward. Nonetheless, Hersh's Watergate investigations led him in 1983 to the publication of The Price of Power: Kissinger <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> White House, a damning portrait of Henry Kissinger that won the National Book Critics Circle Award.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue of}} access to the tapes went to the United States Supreme Court. On July 24, 1974, in United States v. Nixon, the Court ruled {{unanimously}} (8 to 0) that claims of executive privilege over the tapes were void. (Then-Justice William Rehnquist—who had recently been appointed to the Court by Nixon and most recently served <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> Justice Department as Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal Counsel—recused himself from the case.) The Court ordered the President to release the tapes to the special prosecutor. On July 30, 1974, Nixon complied with the order and released the subpoenaed tapes to the public.|$|E
25|$|Wilson {{spoke at}} the funeral {{services}} for former First Lady Pat Nixon in 1993 and former President Richard M. <b>Nixon</b> <b>in</b> 1994 at <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> Library <b>in</b> Yorba Linda, California. Two years later, Wilson became, to date, the most recent governor to speak at a California gubernatorial funeral, that of former Governor Pat Brown.|$|R
2500|$|Allende's {{increasingly}} bold socialist policies (partly {{in response}} to pressure {{from some of the}} more radical members within his coalition), combined with his close contacts with Cuba, heightened fears <b>in</b> Washington. <b>The</b> <b>Nixon</b> administration continued exerting economic pressure on Chile via multilateral organizations, and continued to back Allende's opponents <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chilean Congress. Almost immediately after his election, Nixon directed CIA and U.S. State Department officials to [...] "put pressure" [...] on the Allende government. His economic policies were used by economists Rudi Dornbusch and Sebastian Edwards to coin the term macroeconomic populism.|$|R
5|$|During the {{presidency}} of Richard Nixon, a US government investigation was initiated into American involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> assassinations. <b>Nixon</b> was a political foe of Kennedy, having narrowly lost to him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1960 Presidential election. Nixon ordered an investigation under E. Howard Hunt into the murders, convinced Kennedy must have secretly ordered the killings but the inquiry {{was unable to find}} any such secret order.|$|R
25|$|Although {{influential}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> administration, Usery {{was unable}} to persuade the president to refrain from temporarily suspending the Davis-Bacon Act in 1971. The act set wages for construction workers on projects receiving federal funds. But the Vietnam War was putting significant inflationary pressure on construction wages. Although Nixon suspended Davis-Bacon, Usery and others soon convinced Nixon to reinstate Davis-Bacon enforcement and establish a separate body to review contract union contracts. Within a year, the new committee had {{identified a number of}} wage increases it had deemed extravagant, and won renegotiation of the agreements. Soon, wage increases on Davis-Bacon projects dropped from 14 percent to 6 percent.|$|E
25|$|Kept {{a closely}} guarded secret for many years, in 2017 Brokaw wrote {{of having been}} offered – and having {{promptly}} turned down – the press secretary position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> White House in 1969. Brokaw {{had come to know}} members of the Nixon team, including most particularly H. R. 'Bob' Haldeman (White House chief of staff and initiator of the offer) but also Ron Ziegler, the man who would be press secretary for the whole one-plus terms of the presidency, and others when they were all living and working in California in the years before Nixon came back from defeat in 1960 and 1962 to be elected in 1968.|$|E
25|$|When a given {{nation or}} empire has {{achieved}} regional hegemony, its currency {{has been a}} basis for international trade, and hence for a de facto monetary system. In the West – Europe and the Middle East – an early such coin was the Persian daric. This was succeeded by Roman currency of the Roman empire, such as the denarius, then the Gold Dinar of the Ottoman Empire, and later – from the 16th to 20th centuries, during the Age of Imperialism – by the currency of European colonial powers: the Spanish dollar, the Dutch Gilder, the French Franc and the British Pound Sterling; at times one currency has been pre-eminent, at times no one dominated. With the growth of American power, the US Dollar {{became the basis for}} the international monetary system, formalized in the Bretton Woods agreement that established the post–World War II monetary order, with fixed exchange rates of currencies to the dollar, and convertibility of the dollar into gold. Since the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system, culminating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> shock of 1971, ending convertibility, the US dollar has remained the de facto basis of the world monetary system, though no longer de jure, with various European currencies and the Japanese Yen being used. Since the formation of the Euro, the Euro has gained use as a reserve currency and a unit of transactions, though the dollar has remained the primary currency.|$|E

2500|$|<b>In</b> 1973, <b>the</b> <b>Nixon</b> Administration {{appointed}} Buckley {{to serve}} as a delegate to the United Nations, upon which Buckley would later write a book. In 1981, Buckley informed President-elect (and personal friend) Ronald Reagan that he would decline any official position offered to him. Reagan jokingly replied that that was too bad, because he had wanted to make Buckley ambassador to (then Soviet-occupied) Afghanistan. Buckley replied {{that he was willing to}} take the job but only if he were to be supplied with [...] "10 divisions of bodyguards".|$|R
