Considering the structure and force symmetry, 1 / 2 finite element model of MEW was built. Mooney-Rivilin hyperelastic constitutive model was applied to simulate material nonlinearity, and frictionless contact type was applied to simulate nonlinear contact characteristics.

40|$|Industrial robots are {{introduced}} to belt grinding processes of free-formed surface with <b>elastic</b> <b>wheel</b> nowadays {{in order to obtain}} high quality product and high efficiency.

In this paper, we present a framework of the robot controlled belt grinding simulation system and some key issues in it. We enhance the global removal model to local process model, which can simulate the grinding process more exactly. We also point out the bottleneck of the real-time simulation and put forward a neural network based regression method to meet this difficulty.

40|$|The {{vibration}} behaviour {{of rubber}} <b>elastic</b> <b>wheel</b> sets was simulated in this dissertation. At first the stiffness and the damping {{of an existing}} wheel was tested. Subsequent to this, optimized parameters for an improved design where derived. With this new design the acceleration in the railcar body and the forces in the wheel-rail-contact could be reduced drastically. In contrast to other studies, the complex nonlinear behaviour of radial elastic wheels was considered. The simulation was done by MBS models as well as FE models. With the FE model the deformation of elastic wheels was simulated. In addition to this, considerable measurements were done. So the simulation could be verified by the measurements. Because {{of the complexity of}} the FE model of the rubber <b>elastic</b> <b>wheel,</b> it wasn’t possible to do an FE analysis of a rolling wheel. In MBS programmes it is possible to simulate rolling wheels. The rubber model of Prof. Wahle was used to simulate the complex properties of the rubber. With this model it could be shown that the stiffness and the damping changes with the rotational speed. These effects can not be simulated with linear models for the description of elastomer parts. An improved riding comfort (less acceleration in the railcar body) couldn’t be found for the existing rubber elastic wheels. But the dynamic variation of wheel forces for elastic wheels is smaller then those for inelastic wheels. The dynamic variation of wheel forces is responsible for the polygonisation of wheels. So the polygonisation of elastic wheels is smaller then those for inelastic wheels. This can be the reason for the improved riding comfort for elastic wheels. In a second step improved parameters of the stiffness and damping for rubber elastic wheels were derived. With this improved design the acceleration of the railcar body could be reduced. But with this design the deformation of the rubber is rather large. Because of this a new design is needed. A low radial and axial stiffness causes a reduced critical speed of the wheel sets...|$|E

40|$|Flat or worn wheels {{rolling on}} rough or {{corrugated}} tracks can provoke airborne noise and ground-borne vibration, {{which can be}} a serious concern for nearby neighbours of urban rail transit lines. Among the various treatments used to reduce vibration and noise, resilient wheels play an important role. In conventional resilient wheels, a slightly prestressed V­shaped rubber ring is mounted between the steel wheel centre and tyre. The elastic layer enhances rolling noise and vibration suppression, as well as impact reduction on the track. In this paper the effectiveness of resilient wheels in underground lines, in comparison to monobloc ones, is assessed. The analysed resilient wheel is able to carry greater loads than standard resilient wheels used for light vehicles. It also presents a greater radial resiliency and a higher axial stiffness than conventional V­wheels. The finite element method was used in this study. A quarter car model was defined, in which the wheelset was modelled as an elastic body. Several simulations were performed in order to assess the vibrational behaviour of <b>elastic</b> <b>wheels,</b> including modal, harmonic and random vibration analysis, the latter allowing the introduction of realistic vertical track irregularities, as well as the influence of the running speed. Due to numerical problems some simplifications were needed. Parametric variations were also performed, in which the sensitivity of the whole system to variations of rubber prestress and Poisson’s ratio of the elastic material was assessed. Results are presented in the frequency domain, showing a better performance of the resilient wheels for frequencies over 200 Hz. This result reveals the ability of the analyzed design to mitigate rolling noise, but not structural vibrations, which are primarily found in the lower frequency range...|$|R

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model is developed to analyse the coupled {{horizontal and vertical}} oscillations of an <b>elastic</b> <b>wheel</b> rolling on a flexible rail. For the investigation of high frequency mechanisms both the wheel and the rail are modelled by elastic continua as constituent parts of a single system comprising {{the interaction between the}} rolling wheel and the rail. The nonlinear equations of motion are established by variational techniques which lead in an easy way to the partial differential equations and the nonmaterial boundary conditions at the moving point of contact. To secure mathematical regularity of the governing differential equations at the point of contact material damping is taken into account. A scaling of the equations of motion shows the different magnitudes of all terms which results in a systematical simplification of the different equations. For an analysis of the stability an implicit eigenvalue problem is derived. In certain parameter regions numerical calculations show only a little reserve of stability. Nevertheless the stationary motion remains stable. (orig.)

30|$|In recent years, Zhao et al. [12] {{developed}} a novel non-pneumatic wheel called the mechanical <b>elastic</b> <b>wheel</b> (ME-Wheel). The ME-Wheel {{consists of three}} parts, the flexible tire body, hinge unit and suspension hub. In order to improve the adaptability of military vehicles in complex environment, the ME-Wheel is designed with a statically indeterminate structure. Compared with the conventional pneumatic tire, the ME-Wheel will not have potential risk factors such as flat tire or leakage. Moreover, the double buffered damping structure adopted by the ME-Wheel gives it excellent comfort. The ME-Wheel’s structure and vehicle ride comfort was analyzed by Wang et al. [13]. Wang et al. [14] analyzed the relationship among the excitation frequency, radial deformation, bending stiffness of combined elastic rings, and combined elastic rings’ laminated structure parameters. Zang et al.

[18] studied the mechanical properties of the ME-Wheels with Laplace transform and obtained {{the relationship between the}} tangential deformation and bending angle of the combined elastic rings. Du et al. [19] established a nonlinear three-dimensional finite element wheel–soil interaction model, and simulations with different rotational speeds of the ME-Wheel were conducted.|$|E
30|$|Machining and {{installation}} errors are unavoidable in mechanical structures. However, {{the effect of}} errors on radial stiffness of the mechanical <b>elastic</b> <b>wheel</b> (ME-Wheel) is not considered in previous studies. To this end, the interval mathematical model and interval finite element model of the ME-Wheel were both established and compared with bench test results. The intercomparison {{of the influence of}} the machining {{and installation}} errors on the ME-Wheel radial stiffness revealed good consistency among the interval mathematical analysis, interval finite element simulation, and bench test results. Within the interval range of the ME-Wheel machining and installation errors, parametric analysis of the combined elastic rings was performed at different initial radial rigidity values. The results showed that the initial radial stiffness of the flexible tire body significantly influenced the ME-Wheel radial stiffness, and the inverse relationship between the hinge unit length or suspension hub and the radial stiffness was nonlinear. The radial stiffness of the ME-Wheel is predicted by using the interval algorithm for the first time, and the regularity of the radial stiffness between the error and the load on the ME-Wheel is studied, which will lay the foundation for the exact study of the ME-Wheel dynamic characteristics in the future.|$|E
