It does this by assessing whether smart sketchmaps include the fitfor-purpose land administration elements according to different stakeholder perceptions. Whilst the use of sketch mapping itself is not new in land administration, smart sketchmaps’ technologies and processes allow for conversion of hand drawn sketch maps into topologically and spatially corrected maps. Smart sketchmaps can provide qualitative spatial information in areas where conventional cartographic and geospatial knowledge is often limited.

50|$|During {{the time}} of the Central African Federation, the Northern-Rhodesian Federal government’s Assistant Secretary Fraser, {{believed}} that there may be mineral deposits in Pweto area and therefore all the more need for the Federal Government to protect sovereignty. Weedens Minerals & Chartered Exploration held prospecting rights in that area. These have never been challenged. There is documentation that in 1936, Belgians had asked for 180 acres (730,000 m2) of Northern Rhodesian land apparently where Belgian colonial residences were built. However, no evidence exists that Britain conceded to this request. In 1957, A V Ellison, an official in the Ministry of Lands & Local Government reported to the Federal government of Northern Rhodesia that triangulation surveys had been made by the Anglo-Belgian Boundary Commission from 1911-1913, when eventually a <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>boundary</b> for the northern frontier was agreed upon.

50|$|Historically, Indian {{country was}} {{considered}} the areas, regions, or territories beyond the frontier of settlement that were inhabited primarily by Native Americans. The first grants of land {{in what is now}} the United States made by the King of England left it to the grantee to make such arrangements as they were able with the Indians living on the granted land. As the original 13 colonies grew and treaties were made, the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>boundary</b> between settled territory and Indian country during the 18th century was roughly the crest of the Appalachian Mountains, a boundary set into law by the Royal Proclamation of 1763, the Confederation Congress Proclamation of 1783, and later by the Nonintercourse Act. These areas were defined generally by boundaries set by treaties (or sometimes simply by political circumstances). It was understood that the law of the United States and the laws of individual states were unenforceable in Indian country (for all practical purposes), and tribes that lived on those lands had full sovereignty in those areas.|$|E

50|$|At {{some point}} prior to 1950 {{much of the}} land in the {{adjacent}} community was subdivided into residential lots, and a network of initially unpaved streets was developed.

These <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>boundaries</b> were altered slightly by the construction of the Northwest Tollway in the mid-1950s, forming a barrier separating it from the largely undeveloped southwestern corner of the area as well as the airport area in general. Orchard Place evolved into an unincorporated residential suburban area, with housing development proceeding piecemeal as individual lots were purchased by prospective homeowners and speculative builders.

50|$|Despite the {{declaration}} of himself as emperor, Emperor Zhuangzong was actually facing some difficult times at that time — {{it was said that}} due to frequent Khitan pillaging incursions, Lulong lacked sufficient food supplies; meanwhile, a recent Later Liang counterattack had caused Later Tang to lose Wei Prefecture (衛州, in modern Puyang, Henan, not the same Wei Prefecture where Emperor Zhuangzong was at that time) to Later Liang; further, Li Jitao the military governor of Anyi Circuit (安義, i.e., Zhaoyi, as {{he was the son of}} Emperor Zhuangzong's deceased cousin Li Sizhao and the circuit was therefore renamed to observe naming taboo for Li Sizhao) had also rebelled and submitted to Later Liang. The Later Tang morale was thus low at the time. However, at that time, the Later Liang officer Lu Shunmi (盧順密) of Tianping Circuit (天平, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong) defected to Later Tang and exposed the fact that Tianping's capital Yun Prefecture (鄆州), deeply inside Later Liang territory south of the Yellow River (which formed the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>boundary</b> between Later Tang and Later Liang at that time, notwithstanding Later Tang's recent loss of Wei Prefecture and Anyi Circuit, both of which were north of the Yellow River), was poorly defended, with its military governor Dai Siyuan serving as the overall commander of Later Liang forces against Later Tang at that time and therefore away from the circuit. When Lu further suggested a surprise attack on Tianping, Guo opposed, finding the plan too risky. However, Emperor Zhuangzong's adoptive brother Li Siyuan advocated for the plan, believing that to break the stalemate with Later Liang, a risky move was necessary. Emperor Zhuangzong thus commissioned Li Siyuan to carry out the attack, and Li Siyuan subsequently captured Yun Prefecture in a surprise attack.|$|E
5000|$|In late 918, Li Cunxu {{wanted to}} carry out a major {{campaign}} to destroy Jin's southern archrival Later Liang, and personally took an army south toward Later Liang's capital Daliang. He encountered the main Later Liang army, under the command of the general He Gui, at Huliu Slope (胡柳陂, in modern Heze, Shandong), south of the Yellow River (which then served as the <b>de</b> <b>facto</b> <b>boundary</b> between Jin and Later Liang). The Jin army was initially victorious, but a subsequent confusion in communications led the Jin army to believe that it was being defeated, and the army collapsed. In the confusion, the major general Zhou Dewei was killed, and Li Siyuan lost communications with Li Cunxu, while Li Congke was in the small group of soldiers accompanying Li Cunxu himself. Li Siyuan, believing that Li Cunxu had already crossed the Yellow River north back into Jin territory, headed north across the river, while Li Cunxu, in actuality, was still trying to battle out of the confused rout. Li Congke, serving under Li Cunxu, subsequently assisted Li Cunxu in capturing an earthen mound, allowing Li Cunxu to have superior positioning to launch a counterattack. The Jin counterattack was successful, allowing the Jin army to kill a large number of Later Liang soldiers and leading to the overall battle being effectively a draw, with both armies having lost two thirds of their soldiers and unable to attack each other for some time. At the end of the battle, Li Cunxu was able to capture Puyang (濮陽, in modern Puyang, Henan) as a waypoint to his eventual withdrawal back to his own territory. Li Congke also contributed to the successful counterattack. When Li Siyuan subsequently heard that Li Cunxu was at Puyang, he turned back south and rendezvoused with Li Cunxu there. Li Cunxu, displeased, stated, [...] "Lord, you believed that I was dead? Why did you cross the river?" [...] Li Siyuan had to bow and apologize. It was said that Li Cunxu acted like he forgave Li Siyuan due to Li Congke's contributions, but did not completely do so in his heart, distancing himself from Li Siyuan for several years.|$|E
40|$|New strandings, bycatch and {{sightings}} {{data for}} minke whales {{in the northeast}} Atlantic Ocean south of Cape Finisterre (Galicia) and the Mediterranean Sea were combined with earlier authenticated records, in order to re-assess spatial and temporal distribution, and provide clues to breeding areas and stock identity. The southern range of IWC-defined Northeastern Atlantic and Central North Atlantic stocks with no explicit, but a <b>de</b> <b>facto,</b> <b>boundary</b> of the Equator, was explored in particular. Senegal (6 records), Mauritania (1) and Western Sahara/Southern Morocco (3) are new West African Range States for the North Atlantic minke whale. Morocco and The Gambia are likely Range States. Specimens stranded or captured in Senegal and Mauritania were either calves (n= 6) or neonate (n= 1), a strong indication for a near-by calving ground. Juveniles and calves (median SL: 418 cm, n= 6) commonly occur off the Canary Islands, without apparent seasonality. Two strandings, {{one of which was}} a neonate (in February), were documented in the Azores. Evidence of minke whales is lacking for Madeira and the Cape Verde Islands. The temporal distribution of 33 records from the western coasts of the Iberian Peninsula in the period 1905 - 1998 included all seasons, but 76 % were registered in spring and summer (March-August). The majority of animals were juveniles (mean SL: 537. 5 cm, n= 26); none were neonates. Minke whales were encountered in low numbers in the western and central Mediterranean Sea mostly from March to November, although documented strandings in December and February argue for a year round presence. The Ligurian and Tyrrhenian Seas and the Gulf of Lion are concentration areas, presumably (cf. fin whales) linked to the abundance of euphausiids. Small calves (SL: 300 - 360 cm) suggest that at least some females give birth in the Mediterranean. An unusual stranding in the eastern Black Sea (Georgia) may be related to migration of schooling fish. The southernmost specimen known from the North Atlantic is a calf captured near Hann (14 º 41 'N, 17 º 27 'W), Senegal, in May. Southernmost sightings include: (a) inshore: a foraging individual at Garnet's Bay (24 º 51 'N, 15 º 05 'W) in November; (b) offshore: three minke whales at 10 ° 40 'N, 22 ° 00 'W in December. While small, the sample from West Africa does not seem to support a restricted, seasonal presence. Most likely, these individuals constitute the offspring and juveniles from the Northeastern Atlantic and/or Central North Atlantic populations, but an unrecognised local population cannot be discounted. Preliminary cladistic analysis of the mtDNA control region of one Senegal minke whale yielded equivocal results depending on the fragment sequenced. Field research in the region should be continued to provide the necessary samples to resolve the question of stock identity...|$|E

However, Indonesia's median line argument was accepted for establishing its rights over the water column or exclusive economic zone, resulting in the separation of the two types of boundaries.
