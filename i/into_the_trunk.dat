5|$|Nikki Finn is a {{carefree}} young woman, who {{is always}} dressed in a leather jacket and skirt, with fire-red lips, platinum bob hair and speaking in a high-pitched voice. One day, her boyfriend Johnny uncovers two men stealing money out of a trust fund and takes pictures of the theft. Johnny puts the pictures in a safety deposit box and gives Nikki the key for safekeeping. The thieves catch Johnny and murder him, then frame Nikki by putting his body <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> of her car. Nikki is sentenced to seven years in prison. This is seen during the animated opening credits of the film.|$|E
5|$|Banza {{revealed}} {{his intention to}} stage a coup to Lieutenant Jean-Claude Mandaba, the commanding officer of Camp Kassaï, who he looked to for support. Mandaba {{went along with the}} plan, but his allegiance remained with Bokassa. When Banza contacted his co-conspirators on 8 April 1969, informing them that they would execute the coup the following day, Mandaba immediately phoned Bokassa and informed him of the plan. When Banza entered Camp Kassaï on 9 April 1969, he was ambushed by Mandaba and his soldiers. The men had to break Banza's arms before they could overpower and throw him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> of a Mercedes and take him directly to Bokassa. At his house in Berengo, Bokassa beat Banza nearly to death before Mandaba suggested that Banza be put on trial for appearance's sake.|$|E
5|$|In chapter 3, King Völsung {{is holding}} a {{marriage}} feast for his daughter Signy and King Siggeir at King Völsung's hall. At the hall, large fires are kindled in long hearths running {{the length of the}} hall, while {{in the middle of the}} hall stands the great tree Barnstokkr. That evening, while those attending the feast are sitting by the flaming hearths, they are visited by a one-eyed, very tall man whom they do not recognize. The stranger is wearing a hooded, mottled cape, linen breeches tied around his legs, and is barefooted. Sword in hand, the man walks towards Barnstokkr and his hood hangs low over his head, gray with age. The man brandishes the sword and thrusts it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> of the tree, and the blade sinks to its hilt. Words of welcome fail the crowd.|$|E

5|$|Pierce {{cast the}} actors by {{approaching}} customers {{at a local}} gas station whenever he saw somebody that looked like they fit one of the parts. He hired high school students as crew members who helped load and move equipment. For the creature itself, he limited the sightings to shadowy figures because he felt the film would be more frightening if the creature was left to the viewer's imagination. Pierce sang the theme song featured in the film. Once the film was completed, he put the reel <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> {{of his car and}} drove to Los Angeles seeking post-production services. He met Jamie Mendoza-Nava, who owned a small post-production company and agreed to work on the film for limited up-front pay and {{a small percentage of the}} film's box-office receipts. Pierce could not find a major studio willing to distribute it, so he rented a local movie theater in Texarkana for one week to screen the film. He cleaned the property himself to prepare for the debut.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} morning of Wednesday 3 February 2010, the 26-year-old Faiza Ashraf {{was waiting for the}} bus going from her home in Haslum to {{downtown}} Oslo, where she worked in a clothing boutique. While she was standing at the bus-stop at approx. 06:44, 25-year-old Håvard Nyfløt pulled up, grabbed her and forced her <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> of his car. Ashraf managed to call the police from her cell-phone and inform them that she was being kidnapped, but she could not give her exact location. This event was witnessed by at least one passing motorist.|$|E
25|$|Using an {{elaborate}} phone prank, Tyler brings Lipton {{out in the}} open and kidnaps him in his official car. He stuffs Lipton <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> and takes him on a rough ride to get Mason's address out of him, believing that DeFranco is hiding there. Tyler steals back his impounded van {{with the help of his}} assistant and escapes following a chase through Lower Manhattan with McCarthy's partner. Tyler goes to Mason's mansion where, using his special effects expertise, he kills Mason's guards. McCarthy arrives and seeing two dead guards at the gate, he alerts the State Police.|$|E

5000|$|Pettit {{asked if}} Hoffman was {{deceased}} and Hammond {{said that he}} was. By that time Hoffman had not been breathing for 60 minutes, and {{with the threat of}} losing bell communications looming over his head, supervisor Pettit asked Hammond to “drop back down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunking</b> and lash Craig’s body to the outside of the bell…and they would then bring the bell to the surface.” ...|$|R
25|$|Among {{the models}} was the Skyliner, moved upward from the Fairlane 500 model, and {{featuring}} a retractable hardtop that folded down <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> space. This feature, complicated and expensive, left very little trunk room when folded down. Power retractable hardtops {{have since been}} used by luxury manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz, Lexus, and Cadillac, but in all these cases the vehicle was a two-seater, allowing a much smaller top mechanism than the Skyliner's. Not until 2006, when the Pontiac G6 convertible, Peugeot 206 CC (in Europe) and Volkswagen Eos appeared, did another mass-market model with a rear seat appear in this category.|$|E
25|$|Layering is a {{technique}} in which rooting is encouraged from part of a plant, usually a branch, while it is still attached to the parent plant. After rooting, the branch {{is removed from the}} parent and grown as an independent entity. For bonsai, both ground layering and air layering can create a potential bonsai, by transforming a mature branch <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> of a new tree. The point at which rooting is encouraged can be close to the location of side branches, so the resulting rooted tree can immediately have a thick trunk and low branches, characteristics that complement bonsai aesthetics.|$|E
25|$|Most serious of the elm pests is the {{elm leaf beetle}} Xanthogaleruca luteola, {{which can}} decimate foliage, {{although}} rarely with fatal results. The beetle was accidentally introduced to North America from Europe. Another unwelcome immigrant to North America is the Japanese beetle Popillia japonica. In both instances the beetles cause far more damage in North America owing {{to the absence of}} the predators present in their native lands. In Australia, introduced elm trees are sometimes used as foodplants by the larvae of hepialid moths of the genus Aenetus. These burrow horizontally <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> then vertically down.|$|E

500|$|Many desert {{plants have}} reduced {{the size of their}} leaves or {{abandoned}} them altogether. Cacti are desert specialists and in most species the leaves have been dispensed with and <b>the</b> chlorophyll displaced <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunks,</b> <b>the</b> cellular structure of which has been modified to allow them to store water. When rain falls, the water is rapidly absorbed by the shallow roots and retained to allow them to survive until the next downpour, which may be months or years away. The giant saguaro cacti of the Sonoran Desert form [...] "forests", providing shade for other plants and nesting places for desert birds. Saguaro grow slowly but may live for up to two hundred years. The surface of <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> is folded like a concertina, allowing it to expand, and a large specimen can hold eight tons of water after a good downpour.|$|R

25|$|From Bourne, {{the tidal}} {{waterway}} known to archaeologists as the Bourne–Morton Canal {{and to the}} Middle Ages as the Old Ea, seems to have given Bourne access by boat to the sea, which lay only {{at the far end}} of Bourne North Fen. This meant that the products of the fen and coast such as salt and animal products such as fowls, meat, wool, fish and leather, could be brought across the fen which would normally have obstructed such traffic. This trade may be enough to explain the six Roman roads which radiated, directly or separating a short distance away, from the site. The Long Hollow Road and King Street were two of these, linking respectively, north and south, <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> road system by way of Ermine Street.|$|E
500|$|In {{preparation}} for the tree's felling, some preliminary cutting was undertaken in the tree's north side in the afternoon hours of September 22. This work was done in order to manipulate {{the course of the}} tree's fall, and to estimate the length of time it would take to cut through the remainder of the trunk. After a saw had been worked approximately [...] <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk,</b> it was discovered that the tree was decomposing and open in its center. The lumber crews trimmed the tree's initial cut, and the further work to topple the tree was adjourned until the following morning.|$|E
500|$|Next, the Kings of Wrestling (Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, and Jeff Jarrett) {{fought the}} team of Jeff Hardy, A.J. Styles, and Randy Savage in a Six Man Tag Team match. Earlier in the night, The Kings of Wrestling {{attacked}} Savage and stuffed him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> of a limo, which spend off out of the arena's parking lot. [...] Without Savage, Styles and Hardy had to work the match by themselves. After several minutes of Hardy and Styles fighting off {{all the members of}} The Kings of Wrestling, Savage returned to the arena and walked down to the ring, where he was tagged into the match by Hardy. A few moments later, Savage pinned Jarrett after a punch to the jaw.|$|E
50|$|The dendroglyph ritual may be {{associated}} with death or remembrance. Many scholars over the years have tried to penetrate the reasons behind these incisions <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunks</b> of <b>the</b> kopi (karaka) trees and have not come up with explanations that satisfy everybody. The dendroglyphs cover a range of features, with many representing human figures and others clearly representative of birds, fish, plants and animals. The momori rakau are among the few visible remaining signs of Moriori culture from pre-European contact.|$|R

500|$|Late on February 29, 2008, {{according}} to a report given by the Catholic News Service, Archbishop Rahho was [...] from his car in the Al-Nur district of the city; his bodyguards and driver were killed. [...] According to church officials, [...] "gunmen sprayed the Archbishop's car with bullets, killed two bodyguards and shoved the bishop <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> of a car. In the darkness, he managed to pull out his cellphone and call the church, telling officials not to pay a ransom for his release" [...] they said. [...] "He believed that this money would not be paid for good works and would be used for killing and more evil actions," [...] the officials said. Other reports stated that also investigators believed the archbishop may have been shot {{at the time of the}} kidnapping.|$|E
500|$|On {{the evening}} of September 14, 1972, Kemper picked up 15-year-old Korean dance student Aiko Koo, who had decided to {{hitchhike}} to a dance class after missing her bus. He again drove to a remote area, brandishing a gun on Koo before accidentally locking himself out of his car. However, Koo let him back inside (Kemper had previously gained the 15-year-old's trust while holding her at gunpoint) where he proceeded to choke her unconscious, rape her and kill her. He subsequently packed her body <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> of his car, had a few drinks at a nearby bar, then exited the bar and opened his trunk, [...] "admiring [...] catch like a fisherman," [...] {{and returned to his}} apartment. Back at his apartment, he had sex with the corpse before dismemberment and disposal of her remains in a similar manner as the previous two victims. Aiko's mother, Skaidrite Rubene Koo, called the police to report the disappearance of her daughter and put up hundreds of flyers asking for information as to her daughter's whereabouts, but did not receive one word in response regarding her missing daughter's location or status.|$|E
500|$|Six months later, she {{is working}} as a trainer for 9-1-1 operators. Simultaneously, {{teenager}} Casey Welson (Abigail Breslin) is kidnapped from a mall parking garage after parting with her friend, Autumn, and forced <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> of a car. Casey had taken Autumn's disposable phone, and uses it to call 9-1-1. A rookie operator (Jenna Lamia) receives the call but is unable to handle it, prompting Jordan to take over, though Casey's use of a disposable phone means that her exact GPS location cannot be found. While the kidnapper drives, Jordan guides Casey through knocking out a tail light and signaling people in nearby cars. One woman who sees Casey waving her arm {{out of the trunk}} of the car calls 9-1-1, allowing the police to narrow their search. When Casey tells Jordan that there are cans of paint in the trunk, Jordan has Casey pour the paint out of the taillight hole, attracting the attention of another motorist, Alan Denado (Michael Imperioli) but the kidnapper knocks him out with a shovel, assuming him to be dead and stuffs Alan in the trunk with Casey. He reawakens in the trunk and begins screaming uncontrollably, which causes the kidnapper to stab him. He stops at a gas station where Casey gets an idea to crawl out of the trunk and scream at an active worker for help. The worker attempts to bust the door open, but the kidnapper sprays him with gasoline and throws a lighter at him.|$|E
