40|$|Development {{of small}} {{injection}} moulding machine for forming small plastic articles in small-scale industries was studied. This work which entailed design, construction and test small {{injection moulding machine}} that was capable of forming small plastic articles by injecting molten resins into a closed, cooled mould, where it solidifies to give the desired products was developed. The machine was designed and constructed {{to work as a}} prototype for producing very small plastic components. Design concept, operation, and assembly of components parts were made. Also, working drawings and materials selection were made based on calculations of the diameter of <b>injection</b> <b>plunger,</b> number of teeth required for the plunger rack and spur gear, the angular velocity, number of revolution, torque and power obtained from the electric motor selected and the leverage on the handle of the machine. The machine parts/components were then assembled in line with the designed made, thereafter the constructed machine was tested using high density polyethylene and master batch.

40|$|The {{project is}} to develop a mini micro {{injection}} moulding machine. This study consists of three stages which are design concept, fabrication process, and assembly process of the mini micro injection molding that will capable to run similarly as the real industries conventional micro injection molding machine. For the design concepts, two to three injection molding mechanism is designed, compared and choose the best design that can match the requirement of the mini micro injection machine. After the design has been decided, fabrication process will take place. In this project, it is important to define and organize the best and fastest method that suitable to fabricate the machine. Assembly processes need to be done to complete the machine. It consist of assemble the two unit of injection machine which are injection unit and clamping unit. For the last stage, in order to test and function the machine, we need to make it capable to melt the resin plastic and the <b>injection</b> <b>plunger</b> can inject the molten plastic in to the mould cavity through the nozzle...|$|E

The pump characteristics under investigation were the interval of fuel injection in terms of degrees of crank travel and in absolute time, the lag between the time the <b>injection</b> pump <b>plunger</b> begins its stroke {{and the appearance of}} the jet at the orifice, {{and the manner in which}} the fuel spray builds up to a maximum when the fuel valve is opened, and then diminishes...|$|R
50|$|This engine has {{electronic}} hydraulic activation {{in order}} to increase flexibility with regard to fuel injection and exhaust valve activation. These two factors are adjusted {{in order to}} match operating conditions that a ship may be under. This electronic control of the start to finish of the combustion process is known as the Engine Control System. Fuel injection controls the speed in which the engine will be operating at, while the exhaust valves control the exit of combustion gases from the cylinder. The actuators for fuel injection and the exhaust valves are electronically controlled by the Engine Control System. For fuel <b>injection,</b> a <b>plunger</b> powered by a hydraulic piston is started with oil pressure. Oil pressure is regulated by a valve that is electronically controlled through the Engine Control System. Exhaust valves are opened by a two-stage exhaust valve actuator which is activated by oil delivered from an electronically controlled valve. By controlling these valves electronically, the combustion process is fully controlled by the Engine Control System.|$|R
40|$|As a key {{enabling}} technology, micro moulding is {{the process}} of choice for mass production of various polymer micro components with complex geometry. However, because of the micro dimensions of the moulded components, it is difficult to assess the part quality without using a microscopic observation device. Proper process monitoring can therefore {{play an important role in}} micro moulding process quality control. In the present study, a process monitoring system has been developed to monitor the micro moulding process. Pressure sensors have been employed for <b>plunger</b> <b>injection</b> pressure measurement. An on-line system has been built up for on screen process parameter monitoring. It was found that the measured injection pressure correlated well with part quality and can therefore be used as a process optimisation and quality control index for the micro moulding process...|$|R

The {{purpose is to}} rise the {{operation}} effectiveness of like pumps in production of gasified oils by increase of their output {{at the expense of}} decrease of dynamic vibrarions of string and of creation of new pump units equipped by gasoseparators. The UPN plant (of Bashkortostan Research Planning Oil Institute) as well as the standard procedures and instruments, which provide for necessary accuracy of measurement, have been used for study. The analytical expression to calculate the capacity of pumps has been obtained. The use of developed injection damper allowed to rise the pump capacity by 30 %; this construction allowed to produce 606, 2 t of oil in addition in the undernamed Administration.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{reports on}} an {{optimization}} of die-casting process parameters to identify optimized level {{for improving the}} cycle time using Taguchi method for DOE. AlSic 132 up to 20 tonn machine capacity {{is used to calculate}} cycle time. There are four machining parameters i. e. melting temperature, <b>Injection</b> pressure, <b>Plunger</b> speed, cooling phase. Different experiments are done based on this parameters. Taguchi orthogonal array is designed with three levels and four process Parameters with the help of software Minitab 15. In the first run nine experiments are performed and Cycle time is calculated. Taguchi method stresses the importance of studying the response variation using the signal–to–noise (S/N) ratio, resulting in minimization of cycle time variation due to uncontrollable parameter. The Cycle time was considered as the quality characteristic with the concept of "the larger-the-better". The S/N ratio for the larger-the-better Where n is the number of measurements in a trial/row, in this case, n= 1 and y is the measured value in a run/row. The S/N ratio values are calculated by taking into consideration with the help of software Minitab 15. The Cycle time values measured from the experiments and their optimum value for maximum cycle time. Every day scientists are developing new materials and for each new material, we need economical and efficient die-casting process. It is also predicted that Taguchi method is a good method for optimization of various Diecasing process parameters as it reduces the number of experiments. From the literature survey, {{it can be seen that}} there is no work done on AlSic 132 die-casting process. So in this project the Pressure die casting paramete...|$|R
40|$|The {{commonly}} used <b>plunger</b> <b>injection</b> {{system in the}} microinjection molding (lIM) process has separate screw melting, metering, and injection units. As a result, extra operating parameters and complexity are introduced, in comparison with conventional injection molding. In this study, a lIM machine was used to obtain micromoldings of polyoxymethylene, high-density polyethylene, and polycarbonate. A data acquisition system was developed to record traces of data regarding the evolution of process variables with time. Cavity filling was followed, at the millisecond time scale, using short-shot experiments and traces of injection pressure, runner pressure, and plunger position. Six characteristic process parameters (CPPs) were defined to characterize both the cavity filling and packing stages. The method of design of experiments was used to investigate the effects of machine settings on the CPPs. Metering size, which was optimized for each set of machine variables, was also used as a CPP. Injection speed was the most significant factor affecting <b>plunger</b> velocity and <b>injection</b> pressure during cavity filling, while the effects of mold and melt temperature varied with the material and machine settings.
