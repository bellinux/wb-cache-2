5|$|Basingstoke {{has a wide}} {{diversity}} for musical groups {{ranging from}} brass bands to symphony orchestras. The Basingstoke Concert Band is a traditional wind band which has now been in existence for more than 35 years. The band was started by Lawrie Shaw when Brighton Hill Community School opened in Basingstoke in 1975 {{where he was the}} first headteacher. Lawrie formed the band as an <b>evening</b> <b>class</b> for amateur wind players and it was then known as the Brighton Hill Centre Band. In the years immediately after World War II the Basingstoke Symphony Orchestra was being conducted by D. Cecil Williams.|$|E

To pursue her, he joins an <b>evening</b> <b>class</b> at her college and she {{falls in love}} with him, unaware of his true identity.

As the market is in his control, Gemini refuses the offer and the businessmen hire Teja to execute the job. Feigning an altercation with Gemini, his sidekick Kai (Thennavan) joins Teja's gang, acts as the inside man and foils the plan. Teja becomes enraged at being outsmarted by Gemini.|$|E

25|$|Attending Justin F. Kimball High School {{during the}} early 1970s, Vaughan's late-night gigs contributed to his neglect in his studies, {{including}} music theory; he would often sleep during class. His musical career pursuit was disapproved {{by many of the}} school's administrators, but he was also encouraged by many people to strive for a career in art, including his art teacher. In his sophomore year, he attended an <b>evening</b> <b>class</b> for experimental art at Southern Methodist University, but bailed when it conflicted with rehearsal. Vaughan later spoke of his dislike of the school and stated that he had to receive a daily note from the principal about his grooming.|$|E

2500|$|Robinson was {{determined}} as ever {{to get back}} into the air, and sought his next best chance to do so in Chicago. After opening a garage for income, he repeatedly applied for Curtiss-Wright School of Aviation. Robinson was rejected every time, but circumnavigated this roadblock altogether by becoming a janitor on Saturday nights, thereby being able to listen in on the lessons being taught in the <b>evening</b> <b>class</b> at the time. [...] Becoming exposed to like-minded individuals in the subject, Robinson started the Aero Study Group, one that successfully manage to build its own airplane, tested out by the same night teacher whose class Robinson cleaned, Bill Henderson. Impressed by the plane, Henderson got Robinson a slot at the school and under the instructions of Mr. Snyder, became a licensed pilot. Before long, Robinson convinced the school to allow his peers from the Aero Study Group to enroll and become pilots as well. [...] Later, Robinson, along with his friend Cornelius Coffey formed the Challenger Air Pilots Association for African Americans wanting to fly.|$|E
2500|$|A {{student who}} had been {{enrolled}} more than the years of his course was a [...] "veteran". In the past, when University enrollment {{was a matter of}} social class, some students would accumulate quite a number of enrollments. The individual who had the most was Dux Veteranorum, a notable figure in the student scene at the University. In the middle 1980s for instance, the Dux Veteranorum had more than 20 enrollments in Law School but had graduated in only 2 or 3 courses. This tradition is disappearing as the University is putting constraints in the number of years a student can enroll. Most student costs are supported with public money and it is no longer found acceptable that some individuals burden finances to extend their stays without graduating. However, with the increasing tuition fees a student has to pay to attend the university and the attraction of new types of mature students (almost always as part-time or <b>evening</b> <b>class</b> students) like employees, businessmen, parents, and pensioners, many departments make a substantial profit from every additional student enrolled in courses, with benefits for the university's gross tuition revenue and without loss of educational quality (teacher per student, computer per student, classroom size per student, etc.).|$|E

6000|$|... 'Immediately {{after service}} clinks out the breakfast bell, and, with marvellous promptitude and punctuality, whites and blacks, lay and clerical, are seen {{flocking}} to the mess-room. The whites {{sit at the}} upper end of the table, but beyond the special privilege of tea, all fare alike, chiefly on vegetables: yams or sweet potatoes, and carrots or vegetable marrows, as may suit the season, with plenty of biscuit for more ambitious teeth, and plenty of milk to wash it down. Soon afterwards comes school for an hour and a half. Then work for the boys and men, planting yams, reaping wheat, mowing oats, fencing, carting, building, as the call may be, only no caste distinction or ordering about; it is not go and do that, but come and do this, whether the leader be an ordained clergyman, a white farm bailiff, or a white carpenter. This is noteworthy, and your readers will gain no clear idea of the Mission if they do not seize this point, for it is no matter of mere detail, but one of principle. The system is not that of the ship or the regiment, of the farm or the manufactory of the old country, but essentially of the family. It is not the officer or master saying [...] "Go" [...] but the father or the brother saying [...] "Come." [...] And to this, I firmly believe, is the hearty cheerful following and merry work of the blacks chiefly due. At 1 P.M. is dinner, much the same as breakfast. Meat, though not unknown, is the weak point of the Mission dietary. In the afternoon, work. At 6, tea. In the <b>evening,</b> <b>class</b> again for an hour or two; this <b>evening</b> <b>class</b> being sometimes a singing lesson, heartily enjoyed by the teacher. I forget precisely when the boys have to prepare matter arising out of the lessons they have received viva voce.|$|E
