5|$|Cowpeas {{thrive in}} poor dry conditions, growing well in soils up to 85% sand. This makes them a {{particularly}} important crop in arid, semi-desert regions where not many other crops will grow. As {{well as an}} important source of food for humans in poor arid regions the crop can also be used as feed for livestock. Its nitrogen fixing ability means that as well as <b>functioning</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sole-crop, the cowpea can be effectively intercropped with sorghum, millet, maize, cassava or cotton.|$|E

5|$|Construction on the Commonwealth nursery and Westbourne Woods {{arboretum}} {{was started}} in 1914, and a temporary camp was built near the brickworks to accommodate the workers. Thomas Charles Weston was Officer-in-Charge (Afforestation Branch) in the years 1913 to 1926, and later became Director of City Planting and the Superintendent of Parks and Gardens. Weston was responsible for testing and selecting plant species at the arboretum for their suitability to Canberra's environment; from 1913 through to 1924 Weston oversaw the propagation {{of more than two}} million trees which were then planted in the Canberra area. Most of the original Westbourne Woods arboretum is now leased to the Royal Canberra Golf Club, with the remainder forming part of Weston Park. The Yarralumla nursery is still active, albeit on a smaller scale and <b>functioning</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> retail nursery selling both wholesale and direct to the public.|$|E

5|$|Dietary nickel {{may affect}} human health through infections by nickel-dependent bacteria, {{but it is}} also {{possible}} that nickel is an essential nutrient for bacteria residing in the large intestine, in effect <b>functioning</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> prebiotic. The U.S. Institute of Medicine has not confirmed that nickel is an essential nutrient for humans, so neither a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) nor an Adequate Intake have been established. The Tolerable Upper Intake Level of dietary nickel is 1000µg/day as soluble nickel salts. Dietary intake is estimated at 70 to 100 µg/day, with less than 10% absorbed. What is absorbed is excreted in urine. Relatively large amounts of nickel – comparable to the estimated average ingestion above – leach into food cooked in stainless steel. For example, the amount of nickel leached after 10 cooking cycles into one serving of tomato sauce averages 88µg.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, the Chulkhurst Charity was amalgamated {{with other}} local {{charities}} with similar purposes, {{to form the}} Biddenden Consolidated Charity, still <b>functioning</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> registered charity. The Bread and Cheese Lands were sold for housing, expanding the charity significantly to provide Biddenden pensioners and widows with bread, cheese, and tea at Easter, a cash payment at Christmas, and distribute Biddenden cakes. (During the food rationing of the 1940s and early 1950s, the cheese was replaced by cocoa. Distribution of cheese resumed in 1951.) A wrought iron village sign showing the Biddenden Maids was erected on Biddenden village green in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, Frank Schofield, a Canadian {{veterinary}} pathologist, {{determined that}} the cattle were ingesting moldy silage made from sweet clover, {{and that this was}} <b>functioning</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> potent anticoagulant. Only spoiled hay made from sweet clover (grown in northern states of the USA and in Canada {{since the turn of the}} century) produced the disease. Schofield separated good clover stalks and damaged clover stalks from the same hay mow, and fed each to a different rabbit. The rabbit that had ingested the good stalks remained well, but the rabbit that had ingested the damaged stalks died from a haemorrhagic illness. A duplicate experiment with a different sample of clover hay produced the same result. In 1929, North Dakota veterinarian Dr L.M. Roderick demonstrated that the condition was due to a lack of functioning prothrombin.|$|E

5|$|Suggestions {{have been}} made that wings may have evolved {{initially}} for sailing {{on the surface of}} water as seen in some stoneflies. An alternative idea is that it drives from directed aerial gliding descent—a preflight phenomena found in some apterygote, a wingless sister taxa to the winged insects. The earliest fliers were similar to dragonflies with two sets of wings, direct flight muscles, and no ability to fold their wings over their abdomens. Most insects today, which evolved from those first fliers, have simplified to either one pair of wings or two pairs <b>functioning</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> single pair and using a system of indirect flight muscles.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} main {{accounts}} of the battle, none of them contemporary. The closest is Polybius, who wrote his account 50 years after the battle. Livy wrote {{in the time of}} Augustus, and Appian later still. Appian's account describes events that have no relation with those of Livy and Polybius. Polybius portrays the battle as the ultimate nadir of Roman fortunes, <b>functioning</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> literary device such that the subsequent Roman recovery is more dramatic. For example, some argue that his casualty figures are exaggerated—"more symbolic than factual". Livy portrays the Senate in the role of hero and hence assigns blame for the Roman defeat to the low-born Varro. Blaming Varro also serves to lift blame from the Roman soldiers, whom Livy has a tendency to idealize. Scholars tend to discount Appian's account. The verdict of Philip Sabin—"a worthless farrago"—is typical.|$|E

Opponents to the station however claimed that the new jobs at the power station would go to specialist technicians brought into the region, and that the positioning of the station near Durham would not be beneficial to the city's electricity supply or make the cost of electricity any cheaper for those living near the station. Critics also claimed that wherever in the region a new power station were to be built, County Durham coal would be used in it, and that despite NESCo's claims, there may be more suitable sites elsewhere. The critics claimed that Durham's <b>functioning</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> cultural, educational, administrative and tourist centre, would be ultimately destroyed by heavy industrialisation.|$|E

5|$|Now <b>functioning</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> freeway, the QEW {{was already}} {{overburdened}} by the ever-increasing number of vehicles. The Burlington Bay Skyway, the lone four-lane link {{on the route}} between Hamilton and Toronto, was initially designed to handle 50,000 vehicles daily, but by 1973 there were 60,000 vehicles crossing it. Preliminary work on a second parallel structure began a decade later in 1983. In July of that year, Transportation Minister James Snow broke ground for the new bridge. Construction was carried out over two years, and the twinned structure was opened on October11, 1985. It was named the James N. Allan Skyway, in honour of James Allan, Minister of Highways during construction of the original skyway. The new name was not well received by locals, and debate erupted once again whilst the original bridge was closed and repaired for several years. It reopened on August22, 1988, with Toronto-bound traffic crossing the original bridge. The twin structure was renamed the Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway, though it is {{commonly referred to as}} simply the Burlington Skyway.|$|E
5|$|The nesting {{specimen}} {{was found}} in a stratigraphic area indicating that oviraptorids preferred nesting near streams that provided soft, sandy substrate and food in environments that were otherwise xeric (receiving a small amount of moisture). Many oviraptorids have been found in brooding positions, indicating they may have brooded for relatively long periods, similar to modern birds such as the ostrich, emu, and black-breasted buzzard, which brood for more than 40 days with a limited supply of sustenance. Nesting in desert environments can be harmful to adults that stay in the nest for large parts of the day, and for eggs and nestlings, due to heat stress. The choice of nesting area may therefore have been a mechanism for successful incubation in extreme heat. It has also been suggested that the evolution of tail-feathers in oviraptorosaurs was an adaptation for shading and protecting eggs in their nests. That the second finger of ingeniine oviraptorids was reduced in size compared to the robust first finger may be explained by a change in function; it {{may be related to the}} presence of long wing feathers that were attached to the second finger. These wing feathers were probably used to protect the eggs during nesting. When the second finger began <b>functioning</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> feather support, its ability to grasp was reduced, and this function was taken over by the first finger, which therefore became more robust. The third finger was reduced in size, too, probably because it was positioned behind the wing feathers in a way where it would not be effective for grasping.|$|E
