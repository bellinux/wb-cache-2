I was worried {{early on that}} Lola would be a Southeast Asian version of the Magical Negro, who exists merely to help some self-absorbed white person reach enlightenment. But she's entirely her own wonderful, troubled character, and her relationship with Claire remains complex and unresolved.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the context}} of Spinoza's {{philosophical}} system, the PSR can be understood to unify causation and explanation. What {{this means is that}} for Spinoza, questions regarding the reason why a given phenomenon <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> is (or exists) are always answerable, and are always answerable in terms of the relevant cause(s). This constitutes a rejection of teleological, or final causation, except possibly in a more restricted sense for human beings. Given this, Spinoza's views regarding causality and modality begin to make much more sense.|$|E

[...] " [...] all comes to a head in the penultimate episode, which puts Veronica on the emotional rollercoaster until she gets to the uncomfortable truth." [...] The magazine also praised the reappearances of guest stars: [...] "what really makes the episode special <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> trots out every supporting player and case-of-the-week guest star." [...] IGN ranked the episode 4th on its list of the top ten Veronica Mars episodes, saying that [...] "'A Trip to the Dentist'" [...] is a heavy episode that expertly shows how different people remember the same situation. The fact that Veronica has to threaten people who were at the party into telling her the truth is frakking painful. It's made even more sad when you realize that the version she believed to be the truth actually wasn't." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{measuring}} system for gauging a film's success {{is based on}} unadjusted grosses, mainly because historically this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> has always been done because of the practices of the film industry: the box office receipts are compiled by theaters and relayed to the distributor, which in turn releases them to the media. Converting to a more representative system that counts ticket sales rather than gross is also fraught with problems because the only data available for older films are the sale totals. As the motion picture industry is highly oriented towards marketing currently released films, unadjusted figures are always used in marketing campaigns so that new blockbuster films can much more easily achieve a high sales ranking, and thus be promoted as a [...] "top film of all time", so there is little incentive {{to switch to a}} more robust analysis from a marketing or even newsworthy point of view.|$|E

Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills defended their decision not to play Madonna saying, [...] "I don't think we play Madonna any more. There {{is a lot of}} research, and if you ask a 17-year-old about her, they go 'don't care' [...] it's a sign of the times, things change, it's a generational thing.

Cloke did research on multiple personality disorders before filming, and based the various personalities on people she knew. Morgan also stated that he [...] "wanted to write something for David Duchovny that challenged him." [...] When pitching the idea to director Rob Bowman, the writers stated they wanted [...] "this episode to feel like the part in Ken Burns' Civil War documentary where they read the Sullivan Ballou letter."

500|$|The Book of Lucifer {{contains}} a long chapter titled [...] "Satanic Sex", discussing Satanism's view on sexual activity {{as well as}} misconceptions surrounding these views. He denies the belief that sex {{is the most important}} element in LaVeyan Satanism, and that participation in orgies or other promiscuous behavior is forced. He explains that sexual freedom is encouraged, but only in the sense that believers should be free to explore their own sexualities as they please, without harming others. Along with the rumors regarding Satanic views on sex, LaVey also addresses those about animal and human sacrifice. He explains that the only time a LaVeyan Satanist would perform a human sacrifice would be to accomplish two goals: to [...] "release the magician's wrath" [...] as he or she performed a curse, and to kill someone who deserved to die. He considers the action of hurting another person a request to be destroyed, and explains that the Satanist is morally required to grant this request {{in the form of a}} curse. LaVey also says that a Satanist would never sacrifice a baby or an animal, as they are pure carnal beings and considered to be sacred. In The Book of Lucifer, LaVey outlines LaVeyan Satanism's views on death. He explains that one who has lived a full life will dread death, and that this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> should be. He also does not agree with the idea of reincarnation. He encourages a strong will to live, comparing it to animals' instincts to fight viciously for their lives. Suicide is discouraged except in cases of euthanasia, where it would end extreme suffering. Because the Satanist is considered his or her own god, birthdays are celebrated as the most important holidays. Following one's birthday in importance are Walpurgisnacht and Halloween. Solstices and equinoxes are also celebrated.|$|E
500|$|... "AFRICOBRA II" [...] {{was held}} in 1971 at the Studio Museum in Harlem before it {{traveled}} to five other museums and galleries. Jarrell exhibited Revolutionary and Black Prince (both 1971) at the show. These two portraits are described by art historian Robert Douglas as displaying [...] "Jarrell's masterful understanding of portraiture, rendered through a chiaroscuro technique employing a multitude of meticulously painted B's in different sizes and coolade hues." [...] Revolutionary is a homage to Angela Davis. She wears a Revolutionary Suit that was designed by Jae Jarrell for the AFRICOBRA II exhibition. Prints were made of the work. However, in the original, the cartridge belt {{is attached to the}} canvas, an idea of Jae's. The words [...] "love", [...] "black", [...] "nation", [...] "time", [...] "rest", [...] "full of shit", [...] "revolution", and [...] "beautiful" [...] burst out of her head on the canvas. The message [...] "I have given my life in the struggle. If I have to lose my life, that <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>it</b> will be," [...] travels down her chest and left arm. [...] "B", as usual, represents [...] "blackness" [...] "bad" [...] and in this painting [...] "beautiful". The work epitomizes the goal by AFRICOBRA artists to use all space possible in their creations, described as [...] "jam-packed and jelly tight." [...] Revolutionary was reviewed by Nancy Tobin Willig as [...] "a portrait of a young black woman screaming slogans – with a bandoleer loaded with real bullets slung over her shoulder. Jarrell's painting is an overstatement. It is not art as the weapon. It is the weapon as art." [...] Black Prince is Jarrell's second tribute to Malcolm X. [...] "B" [...] appears in the painting, as well as [...] "P"; [...] "PRINCE" [...] and [...] "BLACK" [...] which travel throughout Malcolm's face and hand. The quote [...] "I believe in anything necessary to correct unjust conditions, political, economic, social, physical. Anything necessary as long as it gets results," [...] is painted across his chest and arm. Their second show, [...] "AFRICOBRA III", opened in 1973. Critics were more aware of the aesthetic and movement at this show; critic Paul Richard commented that the works of Nelson Stevens, Jeff Donaldson and Jarrell [...] "together contradict something I have long believed: that art that is so blatantly political is not art at all." ...|$|E
