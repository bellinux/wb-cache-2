50|$|The {{overwhelming}} success gained him the king's ear. In November 1557, Bayinnaung {{listened to}} Binnya Dala, and rejected his son Crown Prince Nanda's proposal {{to acquire the}} neighboring Chinese vassal Shan states in the north. The king took the advice of Binnya Payan and Binnya Dala to attack the kingdom of Lan Na instead. After Lan Na was acquired in April 1558, the king left Binnya Dala and Binnya Set at Chiang Mai. But their thousand-man garrison was unable to prevent the occupation of eastern Lan Na provinces by King Setthathirath of Lan Xang, a former monarch of Lan <b>Na</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> reclaim his throne at Chiang Mai. They {{had to wait for}} reinforcements to arrive in November 1558 before driving out Lan Xang forces later in the year.|$|R
2500|$|Among those {{referenced}} in {{the song}} was fellow Queensbridge-based rapper Cormega ("And night time is more trife than ever/What up with Cormega, did you see him, are y'all together?"). Cormega's rapping career had been put on hold due to his incarceration during the early 1990s, before his release in 1995. After delivering [...] "shout-outs to locked down comrades", Nas chastizes a youth who seems destined for prison in the final verse, [...] "Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul/Only twelve tryin {{to tell me that}} he liked my style ... Words of wisdom from <b>Nas,</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> rise up above/Keep a eye out for Jake, shorty-wop, one love". Music writer Susan Weinstein wrote that [...] "the literary technique Nas most strongly excels in is the one that would seem to be most pedestrian: rhyme", and cited [...] "One Love" [...] as the first display of Nas's [...] "formal inventiveness".|$|R
50|$|Rear Admiral Bubo <b>Na</b> Tchuto <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> {{organize}} a coup on August 7, 2008, but was pre-empted and arrested; however, {{he managed to}} escape the country. The attempted coup added to instability ahead of parliamentary elections. Gambia subsequently arrested Bubo Na Tchuto. He later returned to Guinea-Bissau disguised as a fisherman and took refuge at a UN compound. Although the UN agreed to surrender him to the government, he continued to reside in the compound. As {{a result of his}} return security in the country was tightened, contributing to uncertainty and instability.|$|R
500|$|The nostalgic [...] "Memory Lane (Sittin' in da Park)" [...] {{contains}} a Reuben Wilson sample, which comprises {{the sound of}} a Hammond organ, guitar, vocals and percussion, and adds to the track's ghostly harmonies. Spence D. of IGN wrote that the lyrics evoke [...] "the crossroads of Old School and New School." [...] "One Love" [...] is composed of a series of letters to incarcerated friends, recounting mutual acquaintances and events that have occurred since the receiver's imprisonment, and address unfaithful girlfriends, emotionally tortured mothers, and underdog loyalty. The phrase [...] "one love" [...] signifies street loyalty in the song. After delivering [...] "shout-outs to locked down comrades", Nas chastises a youth who seems destined for prison in the final verse, [...] "Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul/Only twelve tryin to tell me that he liked my style [...] Words of wisdom from <b>Nas,</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> rise up above/Keep a eye out for Jake, shorty-wop, one love". Produced by Q-Tip, [...] "One Love" [...] samples the double bass and piano from the Heath Brothers' [...] "Smilin' Billy Suite Part II" [...] (1975) and the drum break from Parliament's [...] "Come In Out the Rain" [...] (1970), complementing the track's mystical and hypnotic soundscape.|$|R

When he heard that Byattaba was seeking Lan <b>Na's</b> help, U <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> repair relations with the Tai kingdom by sending his eldest daughter Tala Mi Thiri to Chiang Mai in a marriage of state. It apparently did the job as Lan Na did not interfere. (Queen Thiri would have a terrible time at Chiang Mai, and constantly urged her father to bring her back.

5000|$|The Bòrd {{has been}} criticised for {{inconsistent}} and questionable funding priorities. In 2009, the Bòrd cut off {{funding for the}} Gaelic-language magazine, An Gàidheal Ùr, after ten years of successful publication. The editor of the newspaper also criticised the Bòrd's excessive bureaucracy, stating {{that he had been}} [...] "spending more time dealing with Bord <b>na</b> Gaidhlig in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> access funding than producing the paper." [...] The organisation's funding of Ùlpan courses has also received scathing criticism, with one student stating that his course was neither [...] "structured nor logical" [...] despite over 250,000 pounds allocated for course development in 2012 alone.|$|R

Only {{the older generation}} of Kalinga men and women still have tattoos while the younger generation isn’t interested in tattooing themselves with traditional designs. What processes have played and still {{play a part in}} explaining cultural change with respect to tattooing in Kalinga? On the other hand a group of Filipino-Americans is busy with the revival of their tattoo heritage, albeit in another geographical location. In the U. S.

5000|$|The Rainhill Trials {{started on}} Tuesday, 6 October, and between 10,000 and 15,000 people had {{assembled}} to watch. Five locomotives had arrived, but Perseverance did not compete, having been damaged {{on the way}} to Rainhill, and Cyclops, powered by two horses in a frame, was not a serious entry. Challenging Rocket was Novelty, built by John Ericsson and John Braithwaite in London, and Sans Pareil, built at the Shildon railway works by Timothy Hackworth, the locomotive supervisor of the S&DR. None of the locomotives were ready on Wednesday. The following day at 10:30 am Rocket started its 70 mi journey forwards and backwards across the 1½-mile (2.4-kilometre) course. It covered the first thirty-five miles in 3 hours and 12 minutes, the coke and water were replenished for fifteen minutes, and completed the course in another 2 hours 57 minutes. It had run at an average speed of 12 mph, and the highest speed reached was over 29 mph. Novelty still had to run, and was the favourite, although George is recorded as saying [...] "Eh mon, we needn't fear yon thing, her's got <b>nae</b> goots"; she <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> run that Saturday but a steam pressurised joint rapidly failed. Sans Pareil was found to be overweight the following Tuesday, but allowed to run. She burnt fuel at {{more than three times the}} rate of Rocket before her boiler ran dry. Novelty was tried again the following day, was withdrawn after a joint failed again, and Rocket was declared the winner.|$|R

5000|$|In some places, like [...] "I Can" [...] and the Eminem track [...] "The Cross", the {{production}} is chilling and haunting, but in others, like the generic [...] "radio" [...] track [...] "Hey Nas", it is flat and uninspiring. However, <b>to</b> his credit, <b>Nas</b> <b>tries</b> {{do something different}} {{with many of the}} remaining tracks. [...] "Get Down", the introduction, is unique because it seems to contain many influences, from funk, Soul and Pop to Jazz and Reggae. [...] "Thugz Mansion (NY)", featuring a posthumous verse from 2Pac, is much stronger than its West Coast version on 2Pac's new album, Better Dayz, strengthened by an acoustic guitar ... Finally, [...] "Heaven" [...] appears to have a drum 'n bass influence that accentuates Nas' odd vision of what heaven is to him.|$|R
