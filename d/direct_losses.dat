25|$|Despite of all this, the VOC in 1780 {{remained}} an enormous operation. Its {{capital in the}} Republic, consisting of ships and goods in inventory, totalled 28 million guilders; its capital in Asia, consisting of the liquid trading fund and goods en route to Europe, totalled 46 million guilders.

The prospects of the company at this time therefore need not have been hopeless, {{had one of the}} many plans to reform it been taken successfully in hand. However, then the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War intervened. British attacks in Europe and Asia reduced the VOC fleet by half; removed valuable cargo from its control; and devastated its remaining power in Asia.

He maintains that the Russian Academy of Science figure of 26.6 million total war dead includes about 7 million deaths due to natural causes based on the mortality rate that prevailed before the war. Zemskov maintains that military dead numbered 11.5 million, including nearly 4 million POWs. He maintains that the figure of 6.8 million civilian deaths in occupied regions was overstated because it included persons who were evacuated to the rear areas. He submitted an estimate of 4.5 million civilians who were Nazi victims or {{were killed in the}} occupied zone. Zemskov maintains that the government figure of 2.1 million civilian deaths due to forced labor in Germany was inflated compared to German wartime records that put the deaths of forced workers at 200,000.|$|E
500|$|The {{greatest}} {{damage from}} Longwang {{took place in}} Fujian Province, especially within the city of Fuzhou where torrential rains overwhelmed the Jinan River and its tributaries. The ensuing flood inundated a 13.69km2 (8.5mi2) {{of the city and}} resulted in 62fatalities and left 24people missing. <b>Direct</b> <b>losses</b> from the flood in Fuzhou alone reached 2.2billion RMB (US$264million). Some areas were submerged by flood waters [...] deep and many landslides caused significant damage. A large auto plant owned by the Fujian Motor Industry Corporation, covering 83hectares, was completely flooded. Many auto parts sustained heavy damage and losses at the plant reached 330million RMB (US$39.9million). In Minhou County, Fuzhou, a landslide destroyed a barracks of the Chinese paramilitary police where 142officers were staying. Roughly 7,000soldiers were deployed to the area for search and rescue. Ultimately, 47people were rescued (39of whom were hospitalized) and 85bodies were recovered.|$|E
