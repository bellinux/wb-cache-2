40|$|The <b>Generic</b> <b>Research</b> Cryogenic Tank was {{designed}} to establish techniques for testing and analyzing the behavior of reusable fuel tank structures subjected to cryogenic fuels and aerodynamic heating. The <b>Generic</b> <b>Research</b> Cryogenic Tank tests will consist of filling a pressure vessel to a prescribed fill level, waiting for steady-state conditions, then draining the liquid while heating the external surface to simulate the thermal environment associated with hypersonic flight. Initial tests of the <b>Generic</b> <b>Research</b> Cryogenic Tank will use liquid nitrogen with future tests requiring liquid hydrogen. Two-dimensional finite-difference thermal–fluid models were developed for analyzing {{the behavior of the}} <b>Generic</b> <b>Research</b> Cryo-genic Tank during fill and drain operations. The development and results of the two-dimensional fill and drain models, using liquid nitrogen, are provided, along with results and discussion on extrapolating the model results to the operation of the full-size <b>Generic</b> <b>Research</b> Cryogenic Tank.

40|$|A {{cryogenic}} test article, the <b>Generic</b> <b>Research</b> Cryogenic Tank, {{was designed}} to qualitatively simulate the thermal response of transatmospheric vehicle fuel tanks exposed to the environment of hypersonic flight. One-dimensional and two-dimensional finite-difference thermal models were developed to simulate the thermal response and assist {{in the design of}} the <b>Generic</b> <b>Research</b> Cryogenic Tank. The one-dimensional thermal analysis determined the required insulation thickness to meet the thermal design criteria and located the purge jacket to eliminate the liquefaction of air. The two-dimensional thermal analysis predicted the temperature gradients developed within the pressure-vessel wall, estimated the cryogen boiloff, and showed the effects the ullage condition has on pressure-vessel temperatures. The degree of ullage mixing, location of the applied high-temperature profile, and the purge gas influence on insulation thermal conductivity had significant effects on the thermal behavior of the <b>Generic</b> <b>Research</b> Cryogenic Tank. In addition to analysis results, a description of the <b>Generic</b> <b>Research</b> Cryogenic Tank and the role it will play in future thermal structures and transatmospheric vehicle research at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Facility is presented...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: There are {{challenges}} {{associated with}} selecting a qualitative research approach. In a field abundant with terminology and theories, {{it may be}} difficult for a pharmacist to know where and how to begin a qualitative research journey. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide insight into <b>generic</b> qualitative <b>research</b> and to describe the journey of data collection of a novice qualitative researcher in the quest to answer her research question: 'What are the barriers to accessing medicines and pharmacy services for resettled refugees in Queensland, Australia?' Methodology: <b>Generic</b> qualitative <b>research</b> draws on the strengths of one or more qualitative approaches. The aim is to draw out participants' ideas about things that are 'outside themselves'; rather than focussing on their inner feelings the research seeks to understand a phenomenon, a process, or the perspectives of participants. Sampling is designed to obtain a broad range of opinions about events and experiences and data collection includes interviews, questionnaires or surveys; thematic analysis is often used to analyse data. When to use: <b>Generic</b> qualitative <b>research</b> provides an opportunity to develop research designs that fit researchers' epistemological stance and discipline, with research choices, including methodology and methods, being informed by the <b>research</b> question. Limitations: <b>Generic</b> qualitative <b>research</b> is one of many methodologies that may be used to answer a research question and there is a paucity of literature about how to do it well. There is also debate about its validity as a qualitative methodology...|$|R
