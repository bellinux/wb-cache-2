5000|$|... "The <b>Hardest</b> <b>Button</b> to Button" [...] is a 7" [...] single by the American {{alternative}} {{rock band}} The White Stripes. It {{is the third}} single from their album Elephant. The cover of the single is an allusion to the graphics of Saul Bass, seen in the movie posters and title sequences of films such as Anatomy of a Murder and The Man with the Golden Arm. The cover also alludes to Jack White's then-broken index finger and his obsession with the number 3.|$|R
500|$|The album's first single, [...] "Seven Nation Army", was the band's most successful. The {{song was}} at the top of the rock charts on Billboard. Its success was {{followed}} with a cover of Burt Bacharach's [...] "I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself". The album's third single was the successful [...] "The <b>Hardest</b> <b>Button</b> to Button". [...] "There's No Home for You Here" [...] was the fourth single. In 2004, the album won a Grammy for Best Alternative Music Album, while [...] "Seven Nation Army" [...] won a Grammy for Best Rock Song.|$|R
25|$|He {{received}} an unintentionally backhanded tribute in 1995, when Spike Lee's film Clockers was promoted by a poster that was strikingly similar to Bass's 1959 work for Preminger's film Anatomy of a Murder. Designer Art Sims claimed {{that it was}} made as an homage, but Bass regarded it as theft. Many film posters have been considered to be homages to Saul Bass’s posters. Some recent examples include the theatrical release poster for Burn After Reading (2008) which incorporates Bass’s typography and style of figurative minimalism, and a poster for Precious (2009) which includes elements from several of Bass’s posters, including Anatomy of a Murder. The cover art for The White Stripes' single The <b>Hardest</b> <b>Button</b> to Button is clearly inspired by the Bass poster for The Man with the Golden Arm.|$|R
500|$|In 2007, British {{choreographer}} Wayne McGregor used {{music by}} The White Stripes for his production Chroma, a piece he created for The Royal Ballet in London, England. The orchestral arrangements for Chroma were commissioned by Richard Russell, head of XL Recordings, {{as a gift}} to The White Stripes and were produced by the British classical composer Joby Talbot. Three of these songs, [...] "The <b>Hardest</b> <b>Button</b> To Button", [...] "Aluminium" [...] and [...] "Blue Orchid", were first played to the band as a surprise in Cincinnati Music Hall, Ohio. McGregor heard the orchestral versions and decided to create a ballet using the music. Talbot re-orchestrated the music for the Royal Opera House orchestra, also writing three additional pieces of his own composition. The world premiere of the ballet took place on November 16, 2006 at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, London. The ballet subsequently won the 2007 Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Dance Production.|$|R

5000|$|The game pits futuristic robots {{against one}} another in wrestling matches. The player {{controls}} a robot during battles using a four-icon menu.

Bart, {{bored and}} looking to go home early, plays a game of paddle ball. The game, however, goes awry when the ball flies into several people's mouths, causing mayhem. Homer and Marge {{are faced with the}} angry churchgoers, who have had enough of Bart's antics. As a result, he is forced to see a {{competent}} psychiatrist (from [...] "Brake My Wife, Please") who suggests Bart get a drum set in order to harness his anger and the energy he has and find the focus and discipline that he needs. Bart gets a kit and instantly becomes a natural at it, imagining that every drum and cymbal is Homer's face. He practices non-stop, even while asleep, and, in the style of [...] "The <b>Hardest</b> <b>Button</b> to Button"'s video, he walks through Springfield while drumming and leaving a copy of his drum kit behind him, every time he plays it, and literally runs into The White Stripes on the street, earning Bart an enmity with them. They then try to chase him in the same fashion, until they stop {{in the middle of an}} open bridge and fall into a nearby garbage barge. Eventually, his drumming drives Homer and Marge mad and Lisa suggests to her parents that she can take Bart to a jazz brunch.|$|R

2500|$|Additionally, Omaar has {{expressed}} regret {{about the way}} in which he covered the invasion of Iraq during his time as a BBC correspondent. He suggested that he and his colleagues did pieces on Sadam Hussein, his regime and weapons inspectors, giving little coverage to the Iraqi people. Interviewed in John Pilger's documentary The War You Don't See (2010), Omaar also lamented that [...] "one didn't press the most uncomfortable <b>buttons</b> <b>hard</b> enough" [...] and called the coverage [...] "a giant echo chamber".|$|R
25|$|In 2009, the 2010 {{model year}} ES {{underwent}} a mid-cycle facelift. A slightly revised grille resembled {{that of the}} new Lexus HS, and the lower bumper and taillights were changed. Other exterior changes included chrome-trimmed side moulding, turn signal indicators on the side mirrors, and new split 5-spoke alloy wheels. Memory seating, rain-sensing windshield wipers, and rear seat-mounted side-impact airbags were now standard. The steering wheel controls now had <b>hard</b> touch <b>buttons</b> {{as opposed to the}} previous soft ones. The navigation system shared with the then current Lexus RX now included upgraded VoiceBox speech recognition, Bluetooth phone book downloading, and Lexus Insider, XM Weather, Sports, and Stocks reports, and switched from DVD based maps to an internal hard drive. Bluetooth streaming audio and a USB port that included iPod integration was now built into the stereo.|$|R
5000|$|David Cote in {{his review}} of the Broadway {{production}} for Time Out New York wrote, [...] "I love Hamilton. I love it like I love New York, or Broadway when it gets it right. And this is so right... A sublime conjunction of radio-ready hip-hop (as well as R&B, Britpop and trad showstoppers), under-dramatized American history and Miranda's uniquely personal focus as a first-generation Puerto Rican and inexhaustible wordsmith, Hamilton hits multilevel culture <b>buttons,</b> <b>hard...</b> The work's human drama and novelistic density remain astonishing." [...] He chose Hamilton as a Critics' Pick, and gave the production five out of five stars.|$|R

Yes, I wish he would go away! Yes, he is tiresome. What is he staying here for? If he thinks himself so much better than all of us, I wonder he troubles himself with our company. It's quite time for him to go. No, Fanny, no," [...] cried Kitty with a little broken laugh, still rejecting the outstretched hand, [...] "I'll be flat in private, if you please."

5000|$|On release, Yosemite {{received}} generally positive reviews, with users {{praising the}} simplified user interface. Programmer John Siracusa, who had reviewed every OS release, wrote for Ars Technica that [...] "Yosemite is an aesthetic one-way valve... switching back to Mavericks {{after a week}} or two in Yosemite is like returning to iOS 6. Everything looks embarrassingly chunky, glossy, and gaudy." [...] Macworld's review generally praised Yosemite for its design, but noted that it had found WiFi network issues and that Continuity had proved unreliable. [...] While many reviews in the press praised the new design aesthetic, users were often left baffled with these statements. Widespread disagreement and contention could be found in the comment sections of articles discussing the design of the revamped interface. While some praised the changes as new and fresh, others complained about flattened, <b>hard</b> to distinguish <b>buttons</b> reducing usability. Other critiques concluded the new look to be generally ugly, bright, overly saturated, childlike, or comparing the aesthetic to 'Fisher-Price'.|$|R
6000|$|It was a grand stone building, {{with great}} plate-glass windows--all renewed and improved, they told me, since old Mr. Ronald's time. My letter and my card went {{into an office}} at the back, and I {{followed}} them after a while. A lean, <b>hard,</b> middle-aged man, <b>buttoned</b> up tight in a black frock-coat, received me, holding my written introduction open in his hand. He had a ruddy complexion not commonly seen in Londoners, so far as my experience goes. His iron-gray hair and whiskers (especially the whiskers) were in wonderfully fine order--as carefully oiled and combed {{as if he had}} just come out of a barber's shop. I had been in the morning to the Zoological Gardens; his eyes, when he lifted them from the letter to me, reminded me of the eyes of the eagles--glassy and cruel. I have a fault that I can't cure myself of. I like people, or dislike them, at first sight, without knowing, in either case, whether they deserve it or not. In the one moment when our eyes met, I felt the devil in me. In plain English, I hated Mr. Farnaby! ...|$|R
5000|$|Stevil Van Hostle - {{also known}} as Stevil Van Hostile, Evil Stevil or Bitter Stevil, Stevil is a tech-support worker who commutes from Indianapolis to game {{sessions}} and is quick and vicious to jump on any grudge in the game (sometimes accompanied by his signature gripe, [...] "I can't believe I drove forty-five frickin' miles for THIS!"). On occasions, he {{has been known to}} deliberately trash entire parties and campaigns simply because another player's character won over on him. He has an ongoing grudge against Newt which started when Newt first joined the group; Stevil's character challenged Newt's to [...] "swing at him with a stick" [...] to test his combat prowess (after Newt refused to describe his character in game-statistic terms). Newt's character knocked out Stevil's with his first blow and it was discovered that Stevil had assumed that a [...] "stick" [...] would be a small twig or similar, whereas the [...] "stick" [...] Newt's character had actually used was a full-length pole resembling a log.

500|$|Ars Technica panned the new Tablet mode {{interface}} {{for removing}} the charms and app switching, making the Start <b>button</b> <b>harder</b> to use by requiring users {{to reach for}} the button on the bottom-left rather than {{at the center of the}} screen when swiping with a thumb, and for making application switching less instantaneous through the use of Task View. Microsoft Edge was praised for being [...] "tremendously promising", and [...] "a much better browser than Internet Explorer ever was", but criticized it for its lack of functionality on-launch. In conclusion, contrasting Windows8 as being a [...] "reliable" [...] platform albeit consisting of unfinished concepts, Windows10 was considered [...] "the best Windows yet" [...] and was praised for having a better overall concept in its ability to be [...] "comfortable and effective" [...] across a wide array of form factors, but that it was buggier than previous versions of Windows were on-launch. ExtremeTech felt that Windows10 restricted the choices of users, citing its more opaque setting menus, forcing users to give up bandwidth for the peer-to-peer distribution of updates, and for taking away user control of specific functions, such as updates, explaining that [...] "it feels, once again, as if Microsoft has taken the seed of a good idea, like providing users with security updates automatically, and shoved the throttle to maximum." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{new version}} of the Cone of Silence appears in the 2008 Get Smart film. One of the early {{versions}} of the Cone used in the television series is on display in the CONTROL museum seen {{in the beginning of the}} film. The new version has an appearance more consistent with the cones of silence used in The Nude Bomb than in the television series. It was apparently constructed by the lab guys Bruce and Lloyd, and was untested at the time it was used. It seems much more high-tech, being a small handheld device which, when the button is pressed, creates a cone-shaped beam of light shining down from the ceiling, forming a force field around the person highlighted. This field ought to block all exterior sound, making external communication all but impossible. However, as usual, this updated version is ineffective. The force field was shown to be solid, though, to the point where a panicking Larrabee found he could not escape, to the cause of his greater panic. When Max himself attempts to use the device to hide his glee at being named field agent, it malfunctions and does not even raise the field, permitting everybody to hear his embarrassing shouts. However, in fairness to the manufacturers, this was because Max didn't push the <b>button</b> <b>hard</b> enough.|$|R
