40|$|LectureAn {{investigation}} {{of the effectiveness of}} online combustion turbine axial compressor washing using various purity grade waters and commercial washing detergents was performed. For this project, blade surface fouling dirt was obtained from gas turbine axial compressor blades installed at various field sites. The dirt was analyzed to determine the composition and consistency of typical blade surface fouling materials. A representative dirt formula and blade coating procedure was developed so that comparative tests could be performed using various cleaning fluids. Dirt coated blades were installed in a wind tunnel capable of simulating compressor operating conditions. A spray nozzle upstream of the blade test section was used for washing blades with five different test liquids to determine the effectiveness or advantages of any liquid. Once this testing was completed, a similar test setup was then utilized to inject a mixture of formulated fouling dirt, and the various online cleaning liquids upstream of the blade into the wind tunnel to assess redeposit characteristics. The effect of highpurity water versus regular water on fouling dirt was also studied in separate residue experiments. Results indicate that spraying cleaning fluid into a flowing air stream is a viable means of cleaning a compressor blade. Each of the fluids was able to clean the test blade at both low and high air velocities and at different blade incident angles. Within the parameters/fluids tested, the results indicate that: 1. The blade cleaning is primarily a mechanical function and does not depend on the type of fluid used for cleaning. The results showed that most of the cleaning occurs shortly after the cleaning fluid is introduced into the flow stream. 2. Dirt removed from the blades may redeposit in other areas as the cleaning fluid is evaporated. Redeposit occurred in flow recirculation zones during the cleaning tests, and heated flow tests demonstrated <b>dirt</b> <b>deposit</b> {{in the presence of a}} cleaning fluid. In addition, the type of fluid used for cleaning has no effect on the redeposit characteristics of the dirt. 3. Blade erosion was not found to be a significant issue for the short durations that online water-washing was performed. However, uncontrolled water-washing (or overspray) for extended periods of time did result in measureable leading and trailing edge blade erosions...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} restore the {{original}} aesthetic aspect, to improve {{the state of the}} age patina and of the gold halo, similar processes are required. The cleaning process {{is one of the most}} important aspects for an artwork and is considering a series of deteriorations and degradations, like <b>dirt</b> <b>deposits</b> (clogged or unclogged) opalescent varnish, colors blackening, burns, blisters, gaps (missing ground, painting layer or varnish). This step in the restoration process includes physical and mechanical proceedings like dusting (with a vacuum), brushing (with a brush), scraping (with a scalpel), removal or polishing etc. The scalpel and the milling process are rough unconventional means that are used only in exceptional cases. The wet cleaning of dirt includes classic washing processes, with water or other complex systems of organic solvents (emollients, surface additives or surfactants, mixtures of solvents). Cleaning the clogged <b>dirt</b> <b>deposits</b> with unconventional methods can be done by means of electronic laser, ion and thermal exchange or ultrasounds. Laser cleaning is often used in removing unwanted <b>dirt</b> <b>deposits</b> from different layers of the art piece. A lot of attention goes towards the controlled elimination of the exterior protection layer (varnish), which can be photo- degraded and oxidized by atmospheric exposure. Visual analysis, with enlargers (OM, SEM, AFM etc.) combined with transmission or penetration techniques (radiography, endoscopy, X-ray diffraction etc.) provides information on the superficial structures of the art work. In order to determine the modifications of the desiccant oils, SEM was used to observed the changes in the morphology of the oil painting layers. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) can be used to detrmine detergent residues on the painting layer...|$|R

In other museums this had been successfully carried out by prolonged soaking in water and this method was adopted at the British Museum. However after a few sculptures had been successfully cleaned in this way, the surface of one sculpture started to exfoliate within a very short time after immersion. The washing program was stopped and the sculptures examined to try and determine why the treatment had failed in one case but been successful in others. Analysis quickly established that the surface of the limestone had become partly converted to gypsum (calcium sulphate) by reaction of air pollution with the natural calcite (calcium carbonate). The next question was to determine why the surface of some such stones were unstable when immersed in water and others not.|$|R

The complete mute was traversed on three separate under each of the following environmental conditions: summer while dry, summer white wet, and with road salt. Candela matrices were obtained for a rectangular central portion of the beam, extending from 20 ° left to 20 ° right, and from 5 ° down to 5 ° up (in 0. 5 ° steps). Photometry for each of two lamps was performed twice after the completion of each drive, first 'as is' and then after cleaning. The results indicate that <b>dirt</b> <b>deposits</b> tended to cause the light output to decrease below horizontal and increase near and above horizontal. The {{changes in the}} tight output differed between the driver-side and passenger-side lamps, especially after the two summer drives. The largest changes occurred after the winter drive, with the decreases and increases in {{a large part of the}} beam for both lamps exceeding 25 %, and with some of the increases exceeding 50 %. At the United States, European and Japanese test points that control road illumination, the dirt effects tended to reduce the light output, and some of these decrements exceeded 25 %.

Luminous intensity measurements were obtained for all U. S. and European test points. Photometry for each of two stop lamps was performed twice after the completion of each drive: first “as is” and then after cleaning. The results indicate that <b>dirt</b> <b>deposits</b> tended to cause the light output to decrease at the points tested. The reductions in the light output were greater for the driver-side than the passenger-side lamps under the wet and snowy/salty conditions, but smaller under the dry condition. The reductions after the dry drive were all less than 8 %. However, after the wet and snowy/salty drives reductions of more than 25 % occurred at several test points, with a maximum reduction of 37 %. The greatest percentage reductions occurred for the points at and near the optical axes of the lamps, which had the highest original intensities, and at which maintaining adequate intensity is presumably most important. A theoretical analysis of the changes caused by dirt indicates that this is the pattern of results that will usually occur. A full evaluation of the significance of the effects of dirt that are quantified in this report should be done in the context of other factors that affect signal-lamp intensity, such as vehicle voltage control and lamp design. It may also be important to measure more fully the range and distributions of dirt conditions in the real world. However, the present results demonstrate that, within the range of common weather conditions, dirt can cause reductions of signal-lamp intensity that are large enough to be of concern, especially for the relatively important positions at and near the optical axes of signal lamps...|$|R

For instance, biodiesel has a higher cetane rating (45-60 compared to 45-50 for crude-oil-derived diesel) and it acts as a cleaning agent {{to get rid of}} <b>dirt</b> and <b>deposits.</b> It has been argued that it only becomes economically feasible above oil prices of $80 (£40 or €60 as of late February, 2007) per barrel. This does however depend on locality, economic situation, government stance on biodiesel {{and a host of other}} factors- and it has been proven to be viable at much lower costs in some countries. Also, it yields about 10% less energy than ordinary diesel. Analogous to the use of higher compression ratios used for engines burning higher octane alcohols and petrol in spark-ignition engines, taking advantage of biodiesel's high cetane rating can potentially overcome the energy deficit compared to ordinary Number 2 diesel.|$|R

40|$|Cleaning {{is one of}} {{the first}} and most {{important}} steps in conservative restora- tion intervention, as it removes the unwanted layers of <b>dirt</b> and <b>deposit</b> from the surface of an artefact. It must be done selectively, however, by adapting the cleaning operation to the different zones and removing successive layers of deposit without acting directly on the original materials of the surface. Generally, cleaning protocols are based on chemical or physical procedures with potential negative effects for restorers’ health and/or for the materials constituting the artworks. As an alternative, solvent gels, rigid gels and resin soaps can be used for selective cleaning. In recent decades, biological clean- ing has greatly improved as a result of research into biotechnologies and today plays an important role in the preservation and restoration of cultural assets. Nowadays, biocleaning by viable bacterial cells or hydrolytic enzymes represents a resource with great potential in the restoration of cultural heri- tage, minimising risks for artworks and for human health.

40|$|Over {{the last}} thirty years much {{progress}} has been made in heat exchanger design methodology. Even so, the design engineer still has to deal with a great deal of uncertainty. Whilst the methods used to predict heat transfer coefficients are now quite sophisticated and take account of many physical factors, the results they yield are still inaccurate. Physical property information is required for the estimation of heat transfer coefficients. Available information is often of dubious accuracy. Even given accurate properties modern methods for the predictions of tube-side heat transfer coefficient can be expected to have an accuracy of only ? 10 %. For the shell-side, higher errors (say, around ? 15 %) can be expected. Perhaps worst of all, comes the specification of fouling resistance (the allowance made for the thermal resistance presented by <b>dirt</b> layers <b>deposited</b> on the heat exchanger tubes). In most instances there is little science or understanding behind the specification of these resistances. Traditionally there have been two approaches to dealing with these uncertainties: over-specification of fouling resistance; and, addition of 'design margin' (i. e. addition of extra surface area). There are cases in which both approaches are adopted. The engineer specifying the required duty provides a higher than necessary fouling resistance whilst the exchanger designer adds design margin! Both approaches result in 'over-design'...|$|R
40|$|A {{chemical}} analysis of soil-water mixtures {{and the first}} microscopic images of martian soil {{will be among the}} results to be returned by the Mars Environmental Compatibility Assessment (MECA) payload on the Mars Surveyor Program 2001 Lander. Sponsored by the Human Exploration and Development of Space (HEDS) enterprise, MECA's primary goal is to evaluate potential geochemical and environmental hazards that may confront future martian explorers, and to guide HEDS scientists in the development of high fidelity Mars soil simulants. As a survey of soil properties, the MECA data set will also be rich in information relevant to basic geology, paleoclimate, and exobiology. The integrated MECA payload contains a wet-chemistry laboratory, a microscopy station, an electrometer to characterize the electrostatics of the soil and its environment, and arrays of material patches to study the abrasive and adhesive properties of soil grains. MECA is allocated a mass of 10 kg and a peak power usage of 15 W within an enclosure of 35 x 25 x 15 cm. The Wet Chemistry Laboratory (WCL) consists of four identical cells that will accept samples from surface and subsurface regions accessible to the Lander's robotic arm, mix them with water, and perform extensive analysis of the solution. Ion-selective electrodes and related sensors will evaluate total dissolved solids, redox potential, pH, and the concentration of many soluble ions and gases. Cyclic voltammetry will address oxidants, and anodic stripping voltammetry will probe potentially hazardous trace metals. MECA's microscopy station combines optical and atomic-force microscopy (AFM) in a controlled illumination environment to image dust and soil particles from millimeters to nanometers in size. Careful selection of substrates and an abrasion tool allows experimental study of size distribution, adhesion, abrasion, hardness, color, shape, aggregation, magnetic and other properties. Mounted {{on the end of the}} robot arm, MECA's electrometer consists of four types of sensors: an electric field meter, several triboelectricity monitors, an ion gauge, and a thermometer. Tempered only by ultra-violet- light-induced ions and a low-voltage break-down threshold, the dry, cold, dusty martian environment presents an imposing electrostatic hazard to both robots and humans. In addition, the electrostatic environment is key to transport of dust and, consequently, martian meteorology. MECA will also observe natural dust accumulation on engineering materials. Viewed with the robot arm camera, the abrasion and adhesion plates are strategically placed to allow direct observation of the inter-action between materials and soils on a macroscopic scale. Materials of graded hardness are placed directly under the robot arm scoop to sense wear and soil hardness. A second array, placed on the lander deck, is deployed after the dust plume of landing has settled. It can be manipulated in a primitive fashion by the arm, first having <b>dirt</b> <b>deposited</b> on it from the scoop and subsequently shaken clean. Dust accumulation as a function of conductivity, magnetic field strength, and other parameters will be explored. The MECA instruments described above will assess potential hazards that the Martian soil might present to human explorers and their equipment. In addition, MECA will provide information on the composition of ancient surface water environments, observing microscopic evidence of geological (and biological?) processes, inferring soil and dust transport, comminution and weathering mechanisms, and characterizing soil horizons that might be encountered during excavation.

IS sludge is dark brown in color, having a pH and temperature of 7.2 and 37  °C respectively. The secondary sludge (IIS) is generated in the clarifier of the biological unit used for wastewater treatment. IIS volumes are lower than those corresponding to the primary sludge, since most of the heavy, fibrous or inorganic solids are removed in the primary clarifier (CANMET Energy Technology Centre 2005; Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) 2001). IIS temperature and pH are slightly less than found in IS. Press sludge (PS) is a mixture of primary sludge and secondary sludge following acid treatment, and its pH and temperature are around 3 and 30  °C respectively.

I ntroduction. -The successful use of all low-drag wings, and of thick suction wings in particular, depends on maintaining a laminar boundary layer over a large proportion of the wing surface. This can be achieved readily in the wind tunnel and in test flights if suitable precautions are taken, but in service the chief difficulty is the tendency of the wing to collect dirt and flies on the nose, thus establishing transition to turbulent flow. Since flight tests have shown that the affected region of the wing is usually confined to a few per cent of the chord, it was decided at the National Physical Laboratory to investigate whether laminar flow could be re-established behind this region by the use of {{an auxiliary}} suction slot...|$|R

Sponsored by the Human Exploration and Development of Space (HEDS) enterprise, MECA's goal is to evaluate potential geochemical and environmental hazards that may confront future Martian explorers, and to guide HEDS scientists in the development of high fidelity Mars soil simulants. The integrated MECA payload contains a wet-chemistry laboratory, a microscopy station, an electrometer to characterize the electrostatics of the soil and its environment, and arrays of material patches to study the abrasive and adhesive properties of soil grains. The instrument will acquire soil samples with a robotic arm equipped with a camera. MECA will examine surface and subsurface soil and dust in order to characterize particle size, shape, hardness, and also physical characteristics that may provide clues to mineralogy. MECA will characterize soil/water mixtures with respect to pH, redox potential, total dissolved ions, and trace toxins. MECA will determine the nature of electrostatic charging associated with excavation of soil, and the influence of ionizing radiation on material properties. It will also observe natural dust accumulation on engineering materials. To accomplish these objectives, MECA is allocated a mass of 10 kg within an enclosure of 35 x 25 x 15 cm. The Wet Chemistry Laboratory (WCL) consists of four identical cells that will accept samples from surface and subsurface regions accessible to the Lander's robotic arm, mix them with water, and perform extensive analysis of the solution. Ion-selective electrodes and related sensors will evaluate total dissolved solids, redox potential, pH, and the concentration of many soluble ions and gases in wet Martian soil. These electrodes can detect potentially dangerous heavy-metal ions, emitted pathogenic gases, and the soil's corrosive potential. Experiments will include cyclic voltammetry and anodic stripping voltammetry. Complementary to the Viking experiments, the chemical laboratory will characterize the water-soil solution rather than emitted gases. Nonetheless, through analysis of dissolved gases {{it will be able to}} replicate many of the Viking observations related to oxidants. MECA's microscopy station combines optical and atomic-force microscopy (AFM) in an actively focused, controlled illumination environment to image particles from millimeters to nanometers in size. Careful selection of substrates allows controlled experiments in adhesion, abrasion, hardness, aggregation, magnetic and other properties. Special tools allow primitive manipulation (brushing and scraping) of samples. Soil particle properties including size, shape, color, hardness, adhesive potential (electrostatic and magnetic), will be determined using an array of sample receptacles and collection substrates. The simple, rugged atomic-force microscope will image in the submicron size range and has the capability of performing a particle-by-particle analysis of the dust and soil. On Earth, the earliest forms of life are preserved as microfossils. The atomic-force microscope will have the required resolution to image down to the scale of terrestrial microfossils and beyond. Mounted on the end of the robot arm, MECA's electrometer actually consists of four types of sensors: an electric field meter, several triboelectricity monitors, an ion gauge, and a thermometer. Tempered only by ultraviolet-light-induced ions and a low-voltage breakdown threshold, the dry, cold, dusty martian environment presents an imposing electrostatic hazard to both robots and humans. The field meter will measure the ambient field on nearby objects while the triboelectric sensors, using identical circuitry, will measure the charge accumulated on test substances as they are dragged through the soil by the arm. The ion chamber, open to the environment, will sense both charged dust and free ions in the air. Over and above the potential threat to electronics, the electrostatic environment holds one of the keys to transport of dust and, consequently, Martian meteorology. Viewed with the robot arm camera, the abrasion and adhesion plates are strategically placed to allow direct observation of the interaction between materials and soils on a macroscopic scale. Materials of graded hardness are placed directly under the robot arm scoop to sense wear and soil hardness.

In addition to objectives related to human exploration, the MECA data set will be rich in information relevant to basic geology, paleoclimate, and exobiology issues. To understand both contemporaneous and ancient processes on Mars, the mineralogy, petrology, and reactivity of Martian surface materials should be constrained. The MECA experiment will shed light on these quantities through its combination of chemistry and microscopy. MECA will be capable of measuring the composition of ancient surface water environments, observing microscopic evidence of geological (and biological?) processes, inferring soil and dust transport, comminution and weathering mechanisms, and characterizing soil horizons that might be encountered during excavation...|$|R
