60|$|The squire {{took off}} his hat, and passed <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair, in perplexity.|$|R
60|$|Her father's {{only answer}} was to draw <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> white hair, and wring {{them with a}} shriek of anguish.|$|R
60|$|Francis thrust <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> friend's arm and wheeled him round into Davies Street.|$|E
60|$|The elderly shipping-clerk {{leaned back}} in his chair and ran <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair, thoughtfully.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Father Brown, {{and passed}} <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair {{with the same}} strange vagueness of manner. [...] "Yes, I've heard of it before." ...|$|E
60|$|The painter ran <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair, {{but stopped}} them half-way, as if {{aware that he}} was being guilty of ill-breeding.|$|R
6000|$|FAITH {{has hardly}} {{had time to}} start and {{manifest}} what {{may or may not}} [...] be indignation when MR MARCH dashes <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair.|$|R
6000|$|... "So we have, dear," [...] said George. Then {{drawing his}} child on his knee, he gazed intently on his glorious dark eyes, and passed <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> long curls.|$|R
60|$|Michael Mont in flannels {{stood on}} the {{verandah}} smoking a cigarette. He threw it away as Soames came up, and ran <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's too had; too bad!" [...] Phil Newell ran <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> bushy hair. [...] "I don't {{believe the}} navy-yard {{authorities}} will issue a duplicate order." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You haven’t changed much," [...] {{said the}} grocer, passing <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> spare grey whiskers. [...] "Wait till {{you have a}} wife and seven youngsters. Why, boots alone——" ...|$|E
6000|$|Turnbull thrust <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> {{red hair}} like one who gives {{up the world}} as a bad riddle. [...] "Lord love a duck," [...] said he, [...] "can it be Jamaica?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Down he sank in a chair--ran <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair-- [...] And chanted in mimsiest tones [...] Words whose utter inanity proved his insanity, [...] While he rattled {{a couple}} of bones.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You are not afraid?' he said, running <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> splendid grey beard. 'Not {{afraid that}} those men yonder'--he {{jerked his head}} towards the incessant pop-pop of the guns from the lower woods--'will do you hurt?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A gracious thing," [...] {{the missionary}} answered, passing <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> long beard and {{adjusting}} his glasses. [...] "Ra Vatu has arranged {{that we should}} be well received." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'You {{had better}} not stay {{here in the}} cold. I'll come when I have heard that boy's {{imposition}} and looked over these exercises.' And he ran <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair again.|$|E
6000|$|WELLWYN. [Spasmodically.] Ah! Now that's what I want. [He dabs furiously at the canvas. Then {{standing}} back, runs <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> {{hair and}} turns a painter's glance towards the skylight.] Dash! Light's gone! Off you get, child--don't tempt me! ...|$|R
5000|$|Agatha Christie {{references}} Struwwelpeter in {{her novel}} Curtain (Collins Crime Club, 1975). The story's narrator, Arthur Hastings, describes another character, Stephen Norton: [...] "He {{had a habit}} of running <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> short grey hair until it stuck up on end like Struwwelpeter." ...|$|R
6000|$|Fulkerson pushed both <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> whiskers. [...] "Look here! Look here!" [...] he said. [...] "Won't {{somebody}} start {{some other}} subject? We haven't had the weather up yet, have we? Or the opera? What {{is the matter}} with a few remarks about politics?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Guy {{gazed at}} him in horror. [...] "Oh, don't talk about that!" [...] he cried, running <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair. [...] "If I were even to {{entertain}} such {{an idea for a}} moment, my self-respect would be gone for ever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You feel so fine," [...] he said, pushing <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> open shirt front, {{and gently}} rubbing {{the muscles of}} his side. [...] "It's a {{pleasure}} to work or to stand still. It's a pleasure to yourself—your own physique." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, a young millionaire like Waltham can {{get hold}} of cash {{whenever}} he wants it," [...] answered Dick. He ran <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair thoughtfully. [...] "This looks bad to me. Perhaps I had better take a train back to New York without delay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I's got the key, honey--set down. You needn't cle'r up yo' brain none to fine {{out what}} you gwine to do--I knows what you's gwine to do." [...] Tom sat down and began to pass <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair with a {{helpless}} and desperate air. Roxy said, [...] "Is dat man in dis house?" ...|$|R
60|$|Jan thrust <b>his</b> red <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> black curls, and meditated {{while the}} water surged round his ankles.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, sir!" [...] cried Mr. Lavender, running <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> {{hair and}} staring at the ceiling, [...] "I feared this might seem {{inconsistent}} to your logical German mind. But {{there are many things}} we public men would never do if we could see them being done. Fortunately, as a rule we cannot. Believe me, when I leave you I shall do my best to save you from a fate which I perceive to be unnecessary." ...|$|R
6000|$|He passed <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> {{hair and}} let it stay there, {{clasping}} his thick locks. [...] "Beautiful?" [...] he cried; [...] "of course it 's beautiful! Everything is beautiful; everything is insolent, defiant, atrocious with beauty. Nothing is ugly but me--me and my poor dead brain!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it, I know it!" [...] he cried, passing <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> {{abundant}} {{dark hair}} and making it stand out in a picturesque shock. [...] "I can't be slow if I try. There 's something inside of me that drives me. A restless fiend!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I speak simple truth,' bluntly {{answered}} James, running <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> black hair, to {{the ruin}} of the morning smoothness, so that it, {{as well as the}} whole of his quick, dark countenance seemed to have undergone a change from sunny south to stormy north in the few moments since his first appearance.|$|E
60|$|In rushed also all the loungers {{from the}} other court. In such a place as Carrick-on-Shannon, a breach of promise of {{marriage}} case is not an every day treat, and, consequently, men are determined {{to make the most}} of it. Counsellor O'Laugher runs <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> dark grey hair, opens wide his light blue eye, pulls out the needful papers from that bottomless bag, and though but the other moment so signally defeated in the other court, with sure trust in his own resources prepares for victory.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! the old {{equatorial}} wind {{is blowing}} today, and my hair crackles with electricity." [...] He smiled as he ran <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair. [...] "On such days I long for my pony again. Sometimes, when I can't stand it any longer, I take a train to some little station {{and go out and}} lie flat down on the grass on my back, so that I can't see anything but sky; then I can almost imagine myself back again where the lone old peaks bulge against the sky. Do you know John Muir and Joaquin Miller?" ...|$|R
60|$|The Staffordshire man came, and {{the former}} workmen looked very bitter on him. After a meeting, in which the {{minority}} made many vehement objections, Eustace addressed the workmen in the yards--that is to say, he thought he did; but Harold and Mr. Yolland made his meaning more apparent. A venture in finer workmanship, imitating Etruscan ware, was to be made, and, if successful, would much increase trade and profits, and a rise in wages was offered to such as could undertake the workmanship. Moreover, it was held out {{to them that they}} might become the purchasers of shares or half shares at the market price, and thus have an interest in the concern, whereat they sneered as at some new dodge of the Company for taking them in. It did not seem to me that much was done, save making Harry pore over books and accounts, and run <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> <b>through</b> <b>his</b> hair, till his thick curls stood up in all directions.|$|R
