I don't have many friends in my personal life, but I have so many fans. So when I go outside and people recognize me, it's kind of a bittersweet feeling, like I don't recognize the fans. I don't really have it like they probably think I have it. I'm really still a loser guy, but I'm just really popular now. I don't have a girlfriend no more, and I have this money, but I'm not satisfied with my life. It's this weird feeling of being incomplete, and I need to find myself. So that's kind of what it <b>did</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> and the album just came out with me just fucking rapping some dark shit.|$|E

500|$|When Diane first played me {{what she}} had begun with the song, I needed no convincing about the record... it was about sharing that part of myself with the world... We {{talked a lot about}} what I felt the song needed in order to reach as many young people as possible. I felt that it needed to not stay in a purely {{emotional}} state, but {{that it was going to}} somehow grow throughout the performance and the song and by the end, kind of be full of rage. I feel like what this song accomplishes is women—or men—rising to say, 'You think you can hurt me? You don't know about power.

500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is a [...] "melancholic and mature farewell" [...] to a failed {{relationship}}. Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone wrote Rihanna [...] "slow-boiling" [...] interprets the line [...] "What you <b>did</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> was a crime". According to Jude Rogers of BBC Music the lyrics of the song hint towards her failed relationship with Brown. A reviewer of Plugged In wrote that the lyrics that allude to this are [...] "And I let you reach me one more time/But that’s enough." [...] According to the reviewer, she later admits that the she was blind by her emotional confusion, [...] "your love ain’t the kind you can keep." [...] Jon Pareless of The New York Times wrote that Rihanna compares her love to a crime scene in the [...] "elegiac" [...] "Cold Case Love" [...] which features the couplet [...] "Prints, pictures and white outlines / Are all that's left {{at the scene of}} a cold case love".|$|E
500|$|On February 21, 1989, former Neshoba County sheriff Lawrence A. Rainey filed {{a lawsuit}} against Orion Pictures, {{claiming}} defamation and invasion of privacy. The lawsuit, filed at a United States district court in Meridian, Mississippi, asked for $8 million in damages. Rainey, who was the county sheriff {{at the time of the}} 1964 murders, alleged that the filmmakers of Mississippi Burning had portrayed him in an unfavorable light with the fictional character of Sheriff Ray Stuckey (Gailard Sartain). [...] "Everybody all over the South knows the one they have playing the sheriff in that movie is referring to me," [...] he stated. [...] "What they said happened and what they <b>did</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> certainly wasn't right and something ought to be done about it." [...] Rainey's lawsuit was unsuccessful; he dropped the suit after Orion's team of lawyers threatened to prove that the film was based on fact, and that Rainey was indeed suspected in the 1964 murders.|$|E

"Black Zombie" [...] is an impassioned, self-reflective {{critique}} of problems afflicting the African-American community, including prejudice ("You believe {{when they say}} we ain't shit, we can't grow / All we are is dope dealers and gangstas and hoes"), economic insolvency ("What do we own? The skin on our backs / We rent and we ask for reparations, then they hit us with tax"), and dependency ("I'ma Colombia record slave / So get paid / Control your own destiny, you are a genius / Don't let it happen to you like it <b>did</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> I was a black zombie"). Its socially conscious lyrics deride media stereotypes of African Americans, inequality in the educational system, and black-on-black violence. According to writer Dax-Devlon Ross, the song foreshadowed the themes and [...] "world view" [...] of Nas' subsequent albums. [...] "Poppa Was a Playa" [...] features uncredited co-production by Kanye West, and discusses Nas' complicated relationship with his father, jazz musician Olu Dara, addressing his lusty, itinerant lifestyle throughout Nas' youth. Gabriel Alvarez of Complex calls it an [...] "honest dedication to his old man: a jazz player, a rolling stone" [...] and writes of the song, [...] "The love is there despite the man's faults. Nas crafts a full picture of the past, looking at the infidelity and fights from both parents' perspectives." ...|$|E
500|$|During one scene, a {{frustrated}} Tom Cruise angrily {{jumps up and}} down on a couch while Oprah Winfrey sits next to him. This is a reference to an incident on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 2005, in which Cruise repeatedly jumped on the couch next to Oprah, fell to one knee and loudly professed his love for actress Katie Holmes. Cruise has been repeatedly mocked for his behavior. In another scene, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg are shown to have actor Harrison Ford leashed, chained and ball-gagged, as the actor wears the fedora he wore in the Indiana Jones films. This is a reference to the twelfth season episode [...] "The China Probrem", in which Lucas and Spielberg literally rape Indiana Jones repeatedly, which served as a commentary by Parker and Stone for the poor quality of the 2008 Spielberg/Lucas film, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. A cartoon image of film director Tim Burton is featured in the episode, despite having not been previously ridiculed by the show. In the episode, Burton is mocked for not having an original idea since the 1988 comedy horror film Beetlejuice, and for his tendency to feature film actor Johnny Depp in so many of his films that he should [...] "just have sex with him [...] already". Cartman's Jennifer Lopez hand-puppet repeatedly demands food from the American restaurant chain Taco Bell, particularly enchiritos, {{which is one of the}} many Hispanic stereotypes utilized by the character. [...] Also, when the celebrities are discussing who to bring in to help capture Mohammed, Barbra Streisand is referenced as [...] "her," [...] to which the discussion goes [...] "her who?" [...] "her" [...] "oh...her." [...] This is slightly reminiscent of the movie Little Shop of Horrors when Rick Moranis and Steve Martin are talking about Audrey, who the dentist had physically abused, where Steve asks [...] "what did I ever do to you" [...] and Rick answers [...] "it wasn't what you <b>did</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> it was what you did to her" [...] Steve: [...] "her? oh...her" ...|$|E

Lyrically, the song's theme and content was described as [...] "Scherzinger staving off an ex’s advances" [...] and {{making it clear that}} the relationship is officially over.
