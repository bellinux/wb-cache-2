40|$|In this editorial, {{the author}} {{explains}} that the journal Temperature stands {{on the shoulders of}} giants—prominent scientists of the past and current mem-bers of the Temperature community. Temperature also uses the best tools, such as Google Scholar profiles. The editorial includes a new puzzle: why does warm water freeze faster than cold water? Takeoff With a beautiful photo of the thermo-regulatory behavior of white-fronted bee-eaters on the first cover, Temperature has taken off. Alex Steiner, an Editorial Board member, reflected on this dramatic event in a unique way (Fig. 1). Takeoff—the muscles contract, and the feathery sails fill themselves with compressed air. Great forces develop and produce great accelera-tions, but velocities and altitude remain at near-zero—a true drama of second derivatives! But do not mistake the slow start and <b>a</b> little awkwardness <b>for</b> incom-petence! Some slow starters fly high. Asian geese, the highest flying birds on the planet, are a good example. They may look a bit heavy, but they routinely cruise over the Himalayas! Alex’s photo also contains an unin-tended allegory: one way to see things bet-ter is from a bird’s eye view. An alternative, though even more extravagant, solution <b>for</b> taking <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look</b> would be…to climb onto the shoulders of a giant. And this is exactly what Temperature’s readers, authors, and editors have done. In fact, we have done this in three different ways. First, by Acknowledgin...|$|R

I remember vividly the flickering light, his queer, broad head in silhouette, the dance of the shadows, how we all followed him, puzzled but incredulous, and how there in the laboratory we beheld a larger edition of the little mechanism which we had seen vanish from before our eyes. Parts were of nickel, parts of ivory, parts had certainly been filed or sawn out of rock crystal.

5000|$|A {{group in}} the West Adams {{district}} had organized “The Los Angeles Golf Club”, rented 16 acres at Pico and Alvarado and built a 9-hole golf course, the Windmill Links, so-called because an old windmill served as the clubhouse. In September, 1898, the club decided to incorporate, filing papers on October 3, 1898 as the Los Angeles Country Club. At the time, Sartori {{was considered one of}} the best five players in the club. [...] As other communities began to form golf clubs, a group of these communities formed the California Golf Club Association on July 29, 1899. Sartori would be President of the Association from 1903 to 1905. Late in 1899, realizing that the club needed a larger course, Sartori and other members organized the County Club Land Association and purchased a 107-acre tract from the Cottle Brothers for $25,000 at Pico and Western. Sartori himself planned the new 18-hole course, which opened November 4, 1899. But even this course proved to be unsatisfactory, so Sartori and Tufts <b>looked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> location. They <b>looked</b> at 320 acres of the Wolfskill Ranch nearer to Santa Monica, California. On December 25, 1904, Sartori proposed a plan to purchase the property and hold it for the club. The $48,000 cost was soon subscribed. In October 1905, the Realty Company, the organization formed to purchase and hold the land, proposed to sell the club 145 acres for $22,300 and to use the balance of the property to finance the course and the clubhouse. The clubhouse, designed by Hunt, Eager and Burns, opened May 30, 1911. Sartori was elected President, and was continually re-elected until his death in 1946.|$|R
6000|$|He was not {{dressed as}} usual. In the first place, {{there was a}} round hat on the table, such as men wear in cities. She had never before seen such a hat with him except on a Sunday. And he wore a black cloth coat, and dark brown pantaloons, and a black silk handkerchief. She {{observed}} it all, and {{thought that he had}} not changed <b>for</b> the <b>better.</b> <b>As</b> she <b>looked</b> into his face, it seemed to her more common,--meaner than before. No doubt he was good-looking,--but his good-looks were almost repulsive to her. He had altogether lost his little swagger;--but he had borne that little swagger well, and in her presence it had never been offensive. Now he seemed as though he had thrown aside all the old habits of his life, and was pining to death from the loss of them. [...] "Mary," [...] he said, [...] "I have come to you,--for the last time. I thought I would give myself one more chance, and your father told me that I might have it." [...] He paused, as though expecting an answer. But she had not yet quite made up her mind.

[...] {{answered}} Mrs. Vervain, apparently {{regarding this}} as another of Mr. Ferris's pleasantries; but Padre Girolamo silently confirmed his statement, and she briskly assailed the rule as a disrespect to the sex, which reflected even upon the Virgin, the object, {{as he was}} forced to allow, of their high veneration. He smiled patiently, and confessed that Mrs. Vervain had all the reasons on her side. At the polyglot printing-office, where she handsomely bought every kind of Armenian book and pamphlet, and thus repaid in the only way possible the trouble their visit had given, he did not offer to take leave of them, but after speaking with Ferris, of whom he seemed an old friend, he led them through the garden environing the convent, to a little pavilion perched on the wall that defends the island from the tides of the lagoon. A lay-brother presently followed them, bearing a tray with coffee, toasted rusk, and a jar of that conserve of rose- leaves which is the convent's delicate hospitality to favored guests. Mrs. Vervain cried out over the poetic confection when Padre Girolamo told her what it was, and her daughter suffered herself to express a guarded pleasure. The amiable matron brushed the crumbs of the baicolo from her lap when the lunch was ended, and fitting on her glasses leaned forward <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look</b> at the monk's black- bearded face.

60|$|Kitty stole off {{to explore}} the chamber given her {{at the rear of}} the house; that is to say, she opened the window looking out on what their hostess told her was the garden of the Ursuline Convent, and stood there in a mute transport. A black cross rose in the midst, and all about this wandered the paths and alleys of the garden, through clumps of lilac-bushes and among the spires of hollyhocks. The grounds were {{enclosed}} by high walls in part, and in part by the group of the convent edifices, built of gray stone, high gabled, and topped by dormer-windowed steep roofs of tin, which, under the high morning sun, lay an expanse of keenest splendor, while many a grateful shadow dappled the full-foliaged garden below. Two slim, tall poplars stood against the gable of the chapel, and shot their tops above its roof, and under a porch near them two nuns sat motionless in the sun, black-robed, with black veils falling over their shoulders, and their white faces lost in the white linen that draped them from breast to crown. Their hands lay quiet in their laps, and they seemed unconscious of the other nuns walking in the garden-paths with little children, their pupils, and answering their laughter from time to time with voices as simple and innocent as their own. Kitty looked down upon them all with a swelling heart. They were but figures in a beautiful picture of something old and poetical; but she loved them, and pitied them, and was most happy in them, the same as if they had been real. It could not be that they and she were in the same world: she must be dreaming over a book in Charley's room at Eriecreek. She shaded her eyes <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look,</b> when the noonday gun boomed from the citadel; the bell upon the chapel jangled harshly, and those strange maskers, those quaint black birds with white breasts and faces, flocked indoors. At the same time a small dog under her window howled dolorously at the jangling of the bell; and Kitty, with an impartial joy, turned from the pensive romance of the convent garden to the mild comedy of the scene to which his woeful note attracted her. When he had uttered his anguish, he relapsed into the quietest small French dog that ever was, and lay down near a large, tranquil cat, whom neither the bell nor he had been able to stir from her slumbers in the sun; a peasant-like old man kept on sawing wood, and a little child stood still amidst the larkspurs and marigolds of a tiny garden, while over the flower-pots on the low window-sill of the neighboring house to which it belonged, a young, motherly face gazed peacefully out. The great extent of the convent grounds had left this poor garden scarce breathing-space for its humble blooms; with the low paling fence that separated it from the adjoining house-yards it looked like a toy-garden or the background of a puppet-show, and in its way it was as quaintly unreal to the young girl as the nunnery itself.|$|E

In response, they launch a sustained and comically vengeful campaign against the principals of the association and two bumbling local police officers charged with keeping the [...] "The Knights" [...] in check during their last night in Beverly Hills. The ensuing antics include, among other things, a sexual encounter involving premature ejaculation, a punch bowl being 'spiked' with urine, an initiation ceremony involving four pledges who are left in Watts wearing nothing but the car tires they are left to carry, a cheerleader who forgets to put on her underwear before performing at a pep rally, several impromptu drag races, and the lead character of Newbomb Turk (Robert Wuhl) wearing a majordomo outfit and singing a version of 'Volare' accompanied by the sounds of flatulence. 'Mooning' also plays a prominent role in the film: one of the advertising slogans exploited the recent Apollo space program by touting that The Hollywood Knights was the first movie 'to moon a man on the land'.

40|$|Sustainable {{development}} {{is one of}} the great challenges of 21 st century for various disciplines including city and regional planning. Studies showed that city plans fail to promote sustainable development, design professionals have limited understanding of sustainability issues, and curriculums in design education schools do not put the necessary emphasis on sustainability concepts. However, no study has tested whether planning students’ have a different perception and understanding of sustainable development than other students. Thus, this study aims to understand attitudes of planning students towards sustainable development and compare planning students’ and other students’ knowledge about sustainable development. Data were collected by means of questionnaires, which asked questions about perception and attitudes towards sustainable development, source of information to improve sustainability knowledge, and level of knowledge for general, legal and architectural aspects of sustainability. One hundred ten volunteers (79 planning students, 31 general students) participated in the study. Results showed that students thought that very little sustainable practice appears to be undertaken. Although, planning students thought that the sensitivity to sustainability determines an important percentage of their final grades in a studio project, they reported not using many of the sustainability principles in studios. In addition, planning students reported that they improve their understanding of sustainable development via classes, scientific articles and books. On the other hand, other students reported that they rely on visual and written media to improve their understanding of sustainable development. Despite those differences in sources of information, results showed that, planning students’ level of knowledge (for general, legal and architectural aspects of sustainability) was not different than that of other students. In conclusion, although this study has some methodological drawbacks it is important in highlighting the necessity <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>look</b> to planning education...|$|E
