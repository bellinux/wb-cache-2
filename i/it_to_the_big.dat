2500|$|Initial {{reception}} to {{the first}} season of Neengalum Vellalam Oru Kodi was generally negative, though the show eventually garnered a large viewership and recorded large target rating points.

50|$|According <b>to</b> Roach, <b>the</b> {{idea for}} Our Gang {{came to him}} in 1921, when he was {{audition}}ing a child actress to appear in a film. The girl was, in his opinion, overly made up and overly rehearsed, and Roach waited for <b>the</b> audition <b>to</b> be over. After the girl and her mother left the office, Roach looked out of his window to a lumberyard across the street, where he saw some children having an argument. The children had all taken sticks from <b>the</b> lumberyard <b>to</b> play with, but the smallest child had <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> stick, and <b>the</b> others were trying to force him <b>to</b> give <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>biggest</b> child.

6000|$|Constellations {{have always}} been {{troublesome}} things to name. If you give {{one of them a}} fanciful name, it will always refuse to live up to it; it will always persist in not resembling the thing it has been named for. Ultimately, to satisfy the public, the fanciful name has to be discarded for a common-sense one, a manifestly descriptive one. The Great Bear remained the Great Bear--and unrecognizable as such--for thousands of years; and people complained about it all the time, and quite properly; but as soon as it became the property of the United States, Congress changed <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Big</b> Dipper, and now every body is satisfied, and there is no more talk about riots. I would not change the Southern Cross to the Southern Coffin, I would change it to the Southern Kite; for up there in the general emptiness is the proper home of a kite, but not for coffins and crosses and dippers. In a little while, now--I cannot tell exactly how long it will be--the globe will belong to the English-speaking race; and of course the skies also. Then the constellations will be re-organized, and polished up, and re-named--the most of them [...] "Victoria," [...] I reckon, but this one will sail thereafter as the Southern Kite, or go out of business. Several towns and things, here and there, have been named for Her Majesty already.|$|E
