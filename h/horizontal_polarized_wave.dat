30|$|Polarization {{refers to}} the {{direction}} of vibration of the electric field when the electromagnetic wave propagates, and when the electric field vibrates in the horizontal direction, it is named the <b>horizontal</b> <b>polarized</b> <b>wave.</b> Otherwise, if in the vertical direction, it is named the vertical polarized wave. The dual linear polarization Doppler weather radar mainly alternately or simultaneously transmits horizontal and vertical polarization waves. Moreover, {{the distribution of the}} propagation medium in the space is not uniform, so the different polarization signal attenuation and phase shift will be different. As a result, it is possible to obtain the attenuation difference and the phase shift of the two polarization waves. When the frequency of the radar is higher, the impact of the propagation will be more serious. Through the corresponding processing and calculation, a series of polarimetric measurements such as horizontal reflectivity, vertical reflectivity, differential reflectivity factor, differential propagation phase change, differential propagation phase constant, and co-polar correlation coefficient can be obtained. For the above parameters, the detailed introduction is as follows.|$|E

5000|$|Differential Phase (θdp) - The {{differential}} phase is {{a comparison of}} the returned phase difference between the horizontal and vertical pulses.

Unlike the differential reflectivity, correlation coefficient and linear depolarization ratio, which are all dependent on reflected power, the {{differential phase}} is a [...] "propagation effect."

The range derivative of differential phase (specific differential phase, Kdp) can be used to localize areas of strong precipitation/attenuation.|$|R
40|$|SAW {{devices have}} found wide {{application}} in sensors for detection in gas and liquid environment [1, 2]. In liquid environment, Rayleigh surface waves have a displacement component {{perpendicular to the}} substrate where exist a compressional waves leading to a strong radiation loss [3]. For this reason, shear <b>horizontal</b> (SH) <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> are preferred {{because they do not}} couple elastically with ideal liquids and make no radiation loss [3 - 5]. SH modes can be converted into Love modes by means of a layer acting as a guide. The basic structure of Love wave devices is illustrated in Fig. 1. Due to the waveguide effect, Love waves will be very sensitive to surface perturbations and high sensitivity to surface loading can be achieved. The condition for the existence of Love wave modes is that the shear velocity of the overlay material is less than that of the substrate [3]. Leaky waves of 64 ° YX-LiNbO 3 [6] have been utilized as substrates because of the large electromechanical coupling coefficient (k 2 = 11. 3 %), fast shear velocity (4478 m/s) and negative temperature coefficient of frequency (TCF) [7].

40|$|In this letter, a {{broadband}} bent triangular {{omnidirectional antenna}} is presented for RF energy harvesting. The antenna has a bandwidth for VSWR <= 2 from 850 MHz to 1. 94 GHz.

50|$|The driven {{elements}} are usually half-wave dipoles, fed in phase, mounted {{in a plane}} 1/4 wavelength {{in front of the}} reflector plane. The reflector wires are oriented parallel to the dipoles. The dipoles may be vertical, radiating in vertical polarization, but are most often <b>horizontal,</b> because horizontally <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> are less absorbed by earth reflections. The lowest row of dipoles are mounted more than 1/2 wavelength above the ground, to prevent ground reflections from interfering with the radiation pattern. This allows most of the radiation to be concentrated in a narrow main lobe aimed a few degrees above the horizon, which is ideal for skywave transmission. A curtain array may have a gain of 20 dB greater than a simple dipole antenna. Because of the strict phase requirements, earlier curtain arrays had a narrow bandwidth, but modern curtain arrays can be built with a bandwidth of up to 2:1, allowing them to cover several shortwave bands.|$|R
40|$|The {{macroscopic}} {{governing equations}} controlling the coupled electromagnetics and acous-tics of porous media are numerically solved {{for the case}} of a layered poro-elastic medium. It is shown that these coupled equations decouple into two equation sets describing two uncoupled wavefield pictures. That is, the PSVTM picture where the compressional and vertical <b>polarized</b> mechanical <b>waves</b> drive currents in the P SV particle motion plane that couples to the electromagnetic wavefield components of the T M mode. And the SHTE picture where the <b>horizontal</b> <b>polarized</b> rotational mechanical <b>waves</b> drive cur-rents in the SH particle motion plane that couples to the electromagnetic wavefield components of the T E mode. The global matrix method is employed in computing electroseismograms in layered poro-elastic media in the PSVTM picture. The principal features of the converted electromagnetic signals are the following: (1) contacts all antennas at approximately the same time; (2) arrives at the antennas at half of the seismic traveltime at normal incidence reflected P waves; and (3) changes sign {{on opposite sides of the}} shot. The seismic pulse is shown to induce electric fields that travel with the compressional wavespeed and magnetic fields that travel with the rotational wavefield. The frequency content of the converted electromagnetic field has the same frequency content of the driving incident seismic pulse, as long as the propagation distances are much less than the electromagnetic skin depth. Snapshots in time and converted electromagnetic amplitudes versus seismic point source-antenna offset-are calculated for contrasts in mechanical and/or electrical medium property. Conversion happens there where the seismic wavefront passes a contrast in medium properties due to generated imbalances in current across the contrast. The T M component amplitude radiation pattern away from the interface shows similarities wit...|$|R
30|$|An {{analysis}} of Pc 1 – 2 events indicates a seasonal variation, {{consistent with a}} similar variation in power. In contrast, examining the MLT dependence, {{in addition to a}} main peak of occurrence around noon, also observed in the power analysis, there is a minor peak near midnight. While <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> represent {{only a small fraction of}} the events observed around noon, midnight events are generally <b>polarized</b> <b>waves.</b> Both noon and midnight <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> exhibit a similar frequency distribution. The ellipticity values indicate primarily linearly <b>polarized</b> <b>waves,</b> with the major axis directed at ~  50 ° with respect to the H component. Our results suggest that the power peak at noon is due primarily to unpolarized waves, with a minor contribution represented by linearly <b>polarized</b> <b>waves.</b> This observation is interpreted as waves propagated far from the injection region up to the TNB latitude, in the high-latitude ionospheric waveguide along the meridional direction (Kim et al. 2011). The midnight events are very few with respect to the noon events, but are generally consistent with linearly <b>polarized</b> <b>waves.</b>|$|R
50|$|In electrodynamics, {{elliptical}} polarization is {{the polarization}} of electromagnetic radiation {{such that the}} tip of the electric field vector describes an ellipse in any fixed plane intersecting, and normal to, the direction of propagation. An elliptically <b>polarized</b> <b>wave</b> may be resolved into two linearly <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> in phase quadrature, with their polarization planes at right angles to each other.

50|$|The {{study of}} planar chiral {{metamaterials}} {{has revealed that}} planar chirality is associated with an optical effect: the directionally asymmetric transmission (reflection and absorption) of circularly <b>polarized</b> <b>waves.</b> Planar chiral metamaterials, which are also anisotropic and lossy exhibit different total transmission (reflection and absorption) levels for the same circularly <b>polarized</b> <b>wave</b> incident on their front and back.The asymmetric transmission phenomenon arises from different, e.g. left-to-right, circular polarization conversion efficiencies for opposite propagation directions of the incident wave and therefore the effect {{is referred to as}} circular conversion dichroism.Like the twist of a planar chiral pattern appears reversed for opposite directions of observation, planar chiral metamaterials have interchanged properties for left-handed and right-handed circularly <b>polarized</b> <b>waves</b> that are incident on their front and back.
