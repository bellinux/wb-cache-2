The scale on which diffusion damping works is called the Silk scale and its value corresponds to the size of galaxies of the present day. The mass contained within the Silk scale is called the Silk mass and it corresponds to the mass of the galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Damping {{occurs at}} two {{different}} scales, {{with the process}} working more quickly over short ranges than over longer distances. Here, a short length {{is one that is}} lower than the mean free path of the photons. A long distance is one that is greater than the mean free path, if still less than the <b>diffusion</b> <b>length.</b> On the smaller scale, perturbations are damped almost instantaneously. On the larger scale, anisotropies are decreased more slowly, with significant degradation happening within one unit of Hubble time.|$|E

5|$|The {{effect of}} {{diffusion}} damping is greatly augmented by the finite {{width of the}} surface of last scattering (SLS). The finite width of the SLS means the CMB photons we see were not all emitted at the same time, and the fluctuations we see are not all in phase. It also means that during recombination, the <b>diffusion</b> <b>length</b> changed dramatically, as the ionisation fraction shifted.|$|E
25|$|A {{photodiode}} is a p–n junction or PIN structure. When a photon {{of sufficient}} energy strikes the diode, it creates an electron-hole pair. This mechanism {{is also known}} as the inner photoelectric effect. If the absorption occurs in the junction's depletion region, or one <b>diffusion</b> <b>length</b> away from it, these carriers are swept from the junction by the built-in electric field of the depletion region. Thus holes move toward the anode, and electrons toward the cathode, and a photocurrent is produced. The total current through the photodiode is the sum of the dark current (current that is generated in the absence of light) and the photocurrent, so the dark current must be minimized to maximize the sensitivity of the device.|$|E

We report that the <b>diffusion</b> <b>lengths</b> in CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 single crystals grown by a solution-growth method can exceed 175 μm under 1 sun illumination and exceed 3 mm under weak light for both electrons and holes. The internal quantum efficiencies approach 100 % in 3 mm-thick single crystal perovskite solar cells under weak light.

40|$|Organic-inorganic perovskites {{have shown}} promise as {{high-performance}} absorbers in solar cells, {{first as a}} coating on a mesoporous metal oxide scaffold and more recently as a solid layer in planar heterojunction architectures. Here, we report transient absorption and photoluminescence-quenching measurements to determine the electron-hole <b>diffusion</b> <b>lengths,</b> <b>diffusion</b> constants, and lifetimes in mixed halide (CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 -xClx) and triiodide (CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3) perovskite absorbers. We found that the <b>diffusion</b> <b>lengths</b> are greater than 1 micrometer in the mixed halide perovskite, which is {{an order of magnitude}} greater than the absorption depth. In contrast, the triiodide absorber has electron-hole <b>diffusion</b> <b>lengths</b> of ~ 100 nanometers.

500|$|The <b>diffusion</b> <b>length</b> {{increases}} at recombination {{because the}} {{mean free path}} does, with less photon scattering occurring; this increases the amount of diffusion and damping. The mean free path increases because the electron ionisation fraction, , decreases as ionised hydrogen and helium bind with the free, charged electrons. As this occurs, the mean free path increases proportionally: [...] That is, the mean free path of the photons is inversely proportional to the electron ionisation fraction and the baryon number density (...) [...] That means that the more baryons there were, and the more they were ionised, the shorter the average photon could travel before encountering one and being scattered. Small changes to these values before or during recombination can augment the damping effect considerably. This dependence on the baryon density by photon diffusion allows scientists to use analysis of the latter to investigate the former, {{in addition to the}} [...] history of ionisation.|$|E

5000|$|As {{the name}} suggests, SPV {{measurements}} involve monitoring {{the potential of}} a semiconductor surface while generating electron-hole pairs with a light source. The surfaces of semiconductors are often depletion regions (or space charge regions) where a built-in electric field due to defects has swept out mobile charge carriers. A reduced carrier density means that the electronic energy band of the majority carriers is bent away from the Fermi level. This band-bending {{gives rise to a}} surface potential. When a light source creates electron-hole pairs deep within the semiconductor, they must diffuse through the bulk before reaching the surface depletion region. The photogenerated minority carriers have a shorter <b>diffusion</b> <b>length</b> than the much more numerous majority carriers, with which they can radiatively recombine. The change in surface potential upon illumination is therefore a measure of the ability of minority carriers to reach the surface, namely the minority carrier <b>diffusion</b> <b>length.</b> As always in diffusive processes, the <b>diffusion</b> <b>length</b> [...] is approximately related to the lifetime [...] by the expression , where [...] is the diffusion coefficient. The <b>diffusion</b> <b>length</b> is independent of any built-in fields in contrast to the drift behavior of the carriers.|$|E
50|$|The <b>diffusion</b> <b>length</b> of {{excitons}} {{in organic}} electronic materials is typically {{on the order}} of 10 nm. In order for most excitons to diffuse to the interface of layers and split into carriers, the layer thickness should be in the same range as the <b>diffusion</b> <b>length.</b> However, a polymer layer typically needs a thickness of at least 100 nm to absorb enough light. At such a large thickness, {{only a small fraction of}} the excitons can reach the heterojunction interface.|$|E
50|$|TiO2 {{nanoparticles}} are synthesized {{in several}} tens of nanometer scales (~100 nm). In {{order to make}} a photovoltaic cell, molecular sensitizers (dye molecules) are attached to the titania surface. The dye-absorbed titania is finally enclosed by a liquid electrolyte. This type of dye-sensitized solar cell is also known as a Grätzel cell. Dye-sensitized solar cell has a disadvantage of a short <b>diffusion</b> <b>length.</b> Recently, supermolecular or multifunctional sensitizers have been investigated so as to enhance carrier <b>diffusion</b> <b>length.</b> For example, a dye chromophore has been modified by the addition of secondary electron donors. Minority carriers (holes in this case) diffuse to the attached electron donors to recombine. Therefore, electron-hole recombination is retarded by the physical separation between the dye-cation moiety and the TiO2 surface, as shown in Fig. 5. Finally, this process raises the carrier <b>diffusion</b> <b>length,</b> resulting in the increase of carrier lifetime.|$|E
