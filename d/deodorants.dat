5|$|The element was {{probably}} {{named by the}} alchemist Paracelsus after the German word Zinke (prong, tooth). German chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf is credited with discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746. Work by Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800. Corrosion-resistant zinc plating of iron (hot-dip galvanizing) is the major application for zinc. Other applications are in electrical batteries, small non-structural castings, and alloys such as brass. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as zinc carbonate and zinc gluconate (as dietary supplements), zinc chloride (in <b>deodorants),</b> zinc pyrithione (anti-dandruff shampoos), zinc sulfide (in luminescent paints), and zinc methyl or zinc diethyl in the organic laboratory.|$|E

30|$|The <b>deodorant</b> {{effects of}} {{neutralized}} pyroligneous liquids were chemically studied to investigate their <b>deodorant</b> mechanisms. Three pyroligneous liquids, which {{were obtained from}} nara (Quercus serrata Thunb. and/or Quercus crispula Blume), ubamegashi (Quercus phillyraeoides A. Gray), and mosochiku (Phyllostachys pubescens Mazel), respectively, were neutralized with sodium hydroxide, and then their <b>deodorant</b> activities were examined. Five typical offensive odor compounds, ammonia, trimethylamine, hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, and acetaldehyde, {{were used in the}} <b>deodorant</b> tests. All of the neutralized pyroligneous liquids had clear <b>deodorant</b> effects on ammonia. Although all three of the neutralized pyroligneous liquids exhibited <b>deodorant</b> effects against trimethylamine, the effects of the pyroligneous liquid from ubamegashi were markedly decreased by neutralization. The <b>deodorant</b> effects of the three pyroligneous liquids on hydrogen sulfide were considerably increased by neutralization. The pyroligneous liquids from nara and mosochiku exhibited greater <b>deodorant</b> effects against methyl mercaptan after being neutralized. Finally, acetaldehyde emission was markedly inhibited by the addition of sodium hydroxide to the pyroligneous liquids.|$|R

25|$|Triclosan {{was used}} as a {{hospital}} scrub in the 1970s. Since then, it has expanded commercially and is now a common ingredient in soaps (0.10-1.00%), shampoos, <b>deodorants,</b> toothpastes, mouthwashes, cleaning supplies, and pesticides. It is part of consumer products, including kitchen utensils, toys, bedding, socks, and trash bags.|$|E

25|$|Prevention of candidiasis, {{the most}} common type of vaginitis, {{includes}} using loose cotton underwear. The vaginal area should be washed with water.

On occasions when Nilsen disinterred victims from beneath the floorboards, {{he noted that the}} bodies would be covered with pupae and infested with maggots; some victims' heads had maggots crawling out of eye sockets and mouths. Although Nilsen placed <b>deodorants</b> beneath the floorboards and sprayed insecticide about the flat twice daily, both the odour of decay and the presence of flies remained.|$|E
25|$|According to the Jerusalem Talmud's definition, {{the use of}} the Venturi tube {{spray system}} and spray {{painting}} would come under this prohibition, while butane or propane propelled sprays, which are common in <b>deodorants</b> and air fresheners, etc. are permissible to operate as the dispersal force generated isn't from air, rather from the propellent within the can. According to the Babylonian Talmud's definition, neither of the above spraying methods is involved in sorting undesirable from desirable and therefore not part of this heading. However, as mentioned, the Rema rules that, unusually, the Jerusalem Talmud's definition is the applicable one.|$|E

25|$|In 1920, the Andrew Jergens Company factory {{opened at}} Verdugo Avenue near the {{railroad}} tracks in Burbank. Andrew Jergens, Jr. — aided by his father, Cincinnati businessman Andrew Jergens, Sr. and business partners Frank Adams and Morris Spazier — had purchased the site and built a single-story building. They began with a single product, coconut oil soap, but would later make face creams, lotions, liquid soaps and <b>deodorants.</b> In 1931, despite the Depression, the Jergens company expanded, building new offices and shipping department facilities. In 1939, the Burbank corporation merged with the Cincinnati company of Andrew Jergens, Sr., becoming known as the Andrew Jergens Company of Ohio. The Burbank plant closed in 1992, affecting nearly 90 employees.|$|E
500|$|Some pails were {{supplied}} with <b>deodorants</b> such as iron sulphate. [...] Manchester Corporation attempted {{to remove the}} smell of putrefaction by attaching cinder-sifters to their closets so that fine ash could be poured {{on top of the}} excrement. [...] The Goux system, invented in the 1860s by Pierre Nicholas Goux, a landowner near Paris, and widely used in France, overcame some of the more common problems associated with pail closets by lining the pail with an absorbent material. [...] The Rochdale Corporation experimented with Goux's design for several months but settled instead on a system which used smaller pails. [...] Goux's system did, however, find a home in Halifax, where it was used in more than 3,000closets after 1870. [...] The wooden pails used in Halifax were oval in cross-section (about 24 by 19inches) and 16inches deep. [...] Each was lined at the sides and bottom with a mixture of refuse, such as straw, grass, street sweepings, wool, hair, and even seaweed. [...] This lining, which was formed by a special mould and to which sulphate of lime was added, was designed to help remove the smell of urine, slow putrefaction and keep the excreta dry. [...] Pails were collected between 7am and 5:30pm. [...] Members of the public occasionally complained about the smell, which usually occurred when a pail was left to overflow, such as in winter 1875 when severe weather conditions prevented the horse-pulled collection wagons from reaching the closets.|$|E

5000|$|The first {{commercial}} <b>deodorant,</b> Mum, was introduced and patented {{in the late}} nineteenth century by an inventor in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Edna Murphey. The product was briefly withdrawn from the market in the U.S., but is currently available at U.S. retailers under the brand Ban. The modern formulation of the antiperspirant was patented by Jules Montenier on January 28, 1941. This formulation was first found in [...] "Stopette" [...] <b>deodorant</b> spray, which Time magazine called [...] "the best-selling <b>deodorant</b> of the early 1950s".

40|$|Earwax {{type and}} {{axillary}} odor are genetically determined by rs 17822931, a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) {{located in the}} ABCC 11 gene. The literature has been concerned with the Mendelian trait of earwax, although axillary odor is also Mendelian. Ethnic diversity in rs 17822931 exists, with higher frequency of allele A in east Asians. Influence on <b>deodorant</b> usage has not been investigated. In this work, we present {{a detailed analysis of}} the rs 17822931 effect on <b>deodorant</b> usage in a large (N∼ 17, 000 individuals) population cohort (the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC)). We found strong evidence (P= 3. 7 × 10 − 20) indicating differential <b>deodorant</b> usage according to the rs 17822931 genotype. AA homozygotes were almost 5 -fold overrepresented in categories of never using <b>deodorant</b> or using it infrequently. However, 77. 8 % of white European genotypically nonodorous individuals still used <b>deodorant,</b> and 4. 7 % genotypically odorous individuals did not. We provide evidence of a behavioral effect associated with rs 17822931. This effect has a biological basis that can result in a change in the family’s environment if an aerosol <b>deodorant</b> is used. It also indicates potential cost saving to the nonodorous and scope for personalized genetics usage in personal hygiene choices, with consequent reduction of inappropriate chemical exposures for some...|$|R
