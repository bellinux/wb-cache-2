[...] "When I saw Romper Stomper (1992), I thought Russell was not only charismatic, attractive and talented but also fearless," [...] Stone reasoned. [...] "And I find fearlessness very attractive. I was convinced I wouldn't scare him." [...] Raimi found Crowe to be [...] "bold and challenging. <b>He</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of what we imagine the American cowboy to have been like." [...] On working with Raimi, Crowe later described the director as [...] "sort of like the fourth Stooge." ...|$|E

In the meantime, the singer also worked with French disc jockey Madeon. This was his first experience collaborating with a vocalist face-to-face. On MTV News he clarified that he had [...] "always wanted to work with pop artists and my #1 on my list was Lady Gaga. So when I had the opportunity to do that, I was really thrilled."

He has such an understanding of music at such a young age. <b>He</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of myself so much. He's obsessed, so obsessed with music." ...|$|E

He clarified with MTV News that he had [...] "always {{wanted to work with}} pop artists and my #1 on my list was Lady Gaga. So when I had the opportunity to do that, I was really thrilled." [...] Madeon was associated with co-writing and co-producing three songs on Artpop, [...] "Venus", [...] "Mary Jane Holland" [...] and [...] "Gypsy". In August 2013, while being interviewed by French radio station, Fun Radio, Gaga confirmed that she had recorded [...] "Gypsy" [...] with Madeon and RedOne, as well as White Shadow. Having mutual respect for each others' work, Gaga praised Madeon's production skills saying, [...] "He is so amazing. He has such an understanding of music at such a young age. <b>He</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of myself so much. He's obsessed, so obsessed with music." [...] "Gypsy" [...] was described as Artpops most personal song, about travelling the world and the loneliness associated with it. The song showcases Gaga's fans as being the people with whom she feels at home.|$|E

500|$|In {{reviewing}} {{the first three}} episodes, The New York Times saw in [...] "prim, righteous Brother Justin [...] more of a caricature, but Clancy Brown finds ways to bring some subtle glints of personality to the role." [...] Time commented, [...] "Brother Justin {{comes across as a}} typical whited sepulcher [...] if there's one thing more trite than a dwarf in a surreal drama, it's a preacher with a dark side [...] and Brown's campy performance largely involves shouting 'Enough!' and 'No-o-o-o!' with horror-flick pathos." [...] Entertainment Weekly considered Brown's Brother Justin [...] "delightfully unsettling as the creepy evangelist taking his orders from the wrong superpower", and Variety thought Brown was doing [...] "a superb job straddling the line between stoic and menacing, and there are hints about his weaknesses, conveyed quickly with subtlety." [...] A season 1 DVD review by DVD Talk saw Clancy Brown's performance as [...] "nothing short of brilliant. [...] Brown also has a difficult task capturing the duality of Brother Justin, a man who presents a physically intimidating presence but who wants little more than to be a subdued and loyal servant of his Lord, and he succeeds on every level." [...] DVDverdict stated in a season 2 review that [...] "Brown's presence and charisma is dazzling; he is both likable and frightening. He is an actor {{with a great deal of}} range, and he uses all of it in this series." [...] Referring to Brown's portrayal as [...] "a man of God in Carnivale", the Los Angeles Times saw Brown's [...] "eyes always betray him as someone who, all things considered, would probably be happier caving in your skull and smoking a cigarette afterward than talking to you for another minute." [...] Time Magazine's James Poniewozik depicted the Boardwalk Empire character Nelson Van Alden (played by Michael Shannon) as [...] "such a histrionic, guilt-wracked, damnation-obsessed monster that <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of Brother Justin".|$|E
2500|$|He had the {{pleasing}} {{face and}} he was very virtuous. His speaking style was so delightful that people were not tired of hearing his words and his bright face was very charming. Khomeini said about him: «When I see him, <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of Allah.» ...|$|E
2500|$|Tubridy {{has been}} subject to {{commentary}} about his physical appearance. He {{describes himself as a}} [...] "young fogey". Podge and Rodge, a televised puppet chat show, commented on his [...] "stupid awkward eyes, <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of the undead" [...] and introduced him as [...] "South Dublin on a stick" [...] when he appeared on their TV show.|$|E
60|$|Stroeve, {{looking at}} her with perplexity, hesitated. His {{forehead}} was all puckered, and his red mouth set in a pout. <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> oddly of an agitated guinea-pig.|$|R

2500|$|Frawley's final on-camera {{performance}} was on October 25, 1965, {{with a brief}} cameo appearance in Lucille Ball's second television sitcom The Lucy Show in the episode [...] "Lucy and the Countess Have a Horse Guest".

[...] (Vivian Vance, who by then had left The Lucy Show except for an occasional guest appearance, {{does not appear in}} that episode.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film 4 stars out of 4, writing: [...] "Kill Bill, Volume 1 shows Quentin Tarantino so {{effortlessly}} and brilliantly {{in command of}} his technique that <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of a virtuoso violinist racing through 'Flight of the Bumble Bee'– or maybe an accordion prodigy setting a speed record for 'Lady of Spain'. I mean that as a sincere compliment. The movie is not about anything at all except the skill and humor of its making. It's kind of brilliant." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{willingness}} to play {{anywhere on the}} pitch has earned him the sobriquet El Ilusionista (The Illusionist), El Cerebro (The Brain), El Anti-Galáctico (a pun on Real Madrid players' nickname Los Galácticos), El Caballero Pálido (The Pale Knight) and most recently Don Andrés from the Spanish press. Zinedine Zidane also praised Iniesta, stating on the Spanish radio station Cadena COPE, [...] "Iniesta really impresses me. He's got so much influence in Spain's game. <b>He</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of myself." [...] Fernando Torres, Spain's striker, said, [...] "We've been playing together since we were 15 and I have never, ever seen him play badly." [...] He {{is widely regarded as}} one of the most respected and best midfielders of all time.|$|E

60|$|He was a sheet-anchor-man, {{an earnest}} Baptist, and was well known, {{in his own}} part of the ship, to be {{constant}} in his solitary devotions in the chains. <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of St. Anthony going out into the wilderness to pray.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{no desire}} to try," [...] he said; [...] "but <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> very {{strongly}} of some one I knew in England. What do you call him--Monty?" ...|$|E

60|$|Thus I made it appear, and so persuaded myself, that my {{ambition}} {{had been}} {{prompted by a}} craving for knowledge. As {{soon as he could}} recover himself <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> that <b>he</b> had on many occasions declared I had a brain.|$|R
60|$|I saw Uriah {{watch her}} while she greeted us; and <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of an ugly and rebellious genie {{watching}} a good spirit. In the meanwhile, some slight sign passed between Mr. Micawber and Traddles; and Traddles, unobserved except by me, went out.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Oh, {{it is from}} an old {{lawyer at}} Bath whom I used to know. <b>He</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of {{something}} I said to him {{four or five years}} ago--some little time before we were married--about Dorothy.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This made me laugh; the King {{asked the}} reason. I told him, <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of the RUSSE A PARIS, that charming {{little piece of}} verse of M. de Voltaire's; and we remembered charming things out of it, which made us both laugh. He said, ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{was nervous}} as hell," [...] says Fabian. [...] "I {{walked in and}} <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of a hippy-dippy kind of guy which I loved. He was cool, he was warm, he asked me a lot about my {{personal}} life, I guess to put me at ease." ...|$|R
60|$|The man didn't say a word. He {{seemed to}} be {{brooding}} on something. He {{was one of those}} silent men. <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> of Joe, the old dog down the street at the grocer's shop, who lies at the door all day, blinking and not speaking to anybody.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not wish}} to hear about my uncle at Tanis. <b>He</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of too many things that give pain, and there are nights when one wishes to escape pain, which is sure to be found again on the morrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They tell me," [...] he said, with a smile, [...] "that he is wonderfully like me but, strangely enough, <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> rather of my wife. You {{remember}} her, Shepherd? For {{you were}} stationed at Meerut, {{at the time}} I married her there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then why {{the devil}} don't {{you see that}} he doesn't get too much?" [...] the {{newcomer}} said sharply. [...] "Don't {{you know what it}} means in this climate? Why, he's on the high-road to a fever now. Who on this earth is it <b>he</b> <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have no idea," [...] he answered. [...] "I {{only know}} that when I saw him enter, it gave me almost a shock. <b>He</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> most strangely {{of a man who}} has been dead for many years. I could {{scarcely}} take my eyes off him at first." ...|$|R
60|$|The House was {{certainly}} all mouth for the moment, but, as I could feel, quite in earnest.

5000|$|When I {{spoke to}} John Brown again recently, <b>he</b> <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> that I had {{rejected}} his first effort to re-create Cliff Richard...
