500|$|The {{committee}} {{keeps the}} list of species it considers under review and, from time to time, makes changes. These are usually because species have increased in frequency and no longer meet the numerical criteria for inclusion. A species is removed if {{it has more than}} 150 records in the preceding ten years, with ten or more in at least eight of those years. Different criteria were used in a review in 2006 (see below). [...] There have been three major [...] "purges" [...] of species since the committee's formation. The first was soon after the committee's formation, in 1963, when 16 species were removed: red-crested pochard, snow goose, pectoral sandpiper, Mediterranean gull, Sabine's gull, melodious warbler, icterine warbler, yellow-browed warbler, northern goshawk, golden eagle, red kite, <b>Kentish</b> <b>plover,</b> crested tit, bearded tit, marsh warbler and Dartford warbler. Records of the last eight species had been considered only outside their [...] "normal" [...] British range (e.g. crested tits outside Scotland, and red kites outside Wales). The second was in 1982, when ten further species were removed: Cory's shearwater, purple heron, white stork, buff-breasted sandpiper, Richard's pipit, tawny pipit, Savi's warbler, aquatic warbler, serin and common rosefinch. Savi's warbler was re-admitted to the committee's list in 1998, due to declining numbers of occurrences. Thirdly, in 2006, a further 17 species were dropped from the list: ferruginous duck, Wilson’s petrel, great white egret, black kite, red-footed falcon, American golden plover, white-rumped sandpiper, white-winged black tern, alpine swift, red-rumped swallow, red-throated pipit, subalpine warbler, greenish warbler, dusky warbler, Radde's warbler, Arctic redpoll and rustic bunting. Their selection was based on different criteria from those previously used: more than 200 records in Britain ever, and more than 100 occasions in the last decade.|$|E

50|$|<b>Kentish</b> <b>plovers</b> are ground-nesting birds, {{often with}} a {{preference}} for low, open, moist nesting sites away from thick vegetation and human activity. They use a number of materials to build their nests, mainly consisting of shells, pebbles, grass and leaves in a small scrape in the ground. Like most <b>plovers,</b> the <b>Kentish</b> <b>plovers</b> are predominantly insectivores, feeding on a large range of arthropods and invertebrates depending on the environment, by using a run and stop method.|$|R
40|$|Capsule Hot environments are {{associated}} with more biparental care, high nest-site fidelity and low mate fidelity. Aims To investigate the breeding ecology and parental behaviour of <b>Kentish</b> <b>Plovers</b> in an extremely hot environment. <b>Kentish</b> <b>Plovers</b> have an unusually diverse breeding {{system in which the}} frequencies of biparental, female-only and male-only care vary between populations. A common, but rarely tested, explanation for such a variation is local adaptation: birds exhibit social traits that are adaptive to their breeding environment. In particular, we investigated the effect of a hot environment on breeding success, distribution of care types, and mate and site fidelity. Methods A breeding population of approximately 200 pairs of <b>Kentish</b> <b>Plovers</b> was investigated in 2005 and 2006 at Al Wathba Wetland near Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. Results We found high nest-site fidelity, low mate fidelity and more biparental care in Al Wathba than in most temperate zone populations of <b>Kentish</b> <b>Plovers.</b> Conclusions Our results are consistent with the argument that a harsh environment can select for biparental care. However, further studies are warranted to distinguish between alternative hypotheses for the different distribution of social behaviours of breeding populations...|$|R
60|$|There {{was nothing}} new to me in all this: {{it was an old}} {{familiar}} story; I have given it fully, simply because it is an accurate statement of what is being done all over the country. There is not a county in the kingdom where you may not hear of important members of the community who are collectors of birds and their eggs, and law-breakers, both directly and indirectly, every day of their lives. They all take, and pay for, every rare visitant that comes in their way, and also require an unlimited supply of the rarer resident species for the purpose of exchange with other private collectors in distant counties. In this way our finest species are gradually being extirpated. Within the last few years we have seen the disappearance (as breeding species) of the ruff and reeve, marsh harrier, and honey buzzard; and the species now on the verge of extinction, which will soon follow these and others that have gone before, if indeed some of them have not already gone, are the sea-eagle, osprey, kite, hen harrier, Montagu's harrier, stone curlew, <b>Kentish</b> <b>plover,</b> dotterel, red-necked phalarope, roseate tern, bearded tit, grey-lag goose, and great skua. These in their turn will be followed by the chough, hobby, great black-backed gull, furze wren, crested tit, and others. These are the species which, as things are going, will absolutely and for ever disappear, as residents and breeders, from off the British Islands. Meanwhile other species that, although comparatively rare, are less local in their distribution, are being annually exterminated {{in some parts of the}} country: it is poor comfort to the bird lover in southern England to know that many species that formerly gave life and interest to the scene, and have lately been done to death there, may still be met with in the wilder districts of Scotland, or in some forest in the north of Wales. Finally, we have among our annual visitants a considerable number of species which have either bred in these islands in past times (some quite recently), or else would probably remain to breed if they were not immediately killed on arrival--bittern, little bittern, night heron, spoonbill, stork, avocet, black tern, hoopoe, golden oriole, and many others of less well-known names.|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{estimates}} of annual survival {{are necessary for}} conservation of threatened species of migratory birds. We studied a large, stable population of <b>Kentish</b> <b>Plovers</b> (Charadrius alexandrinus) breeding in southern Turkey (36 degrees 43 'N, 35 degrees 03 'E) for five breeding seasons (1996 - 2000). <b>Kentish</b> <b>Plovers</b> of Eurasia and the conspecific Snowy Plover of North America are a species of conservation concern. We captured 2077 birds, and used time since marking models to estimate apparent survival (phi) and encounter rates (p) for juvenile and adult plovers. Return rates of young banded in their natal year were low (4 %, 52 of 1176) and most philopatric young were recaptured as yearlings (69 %, 36 of 52). Low return rates of shorebird young {{can be attributed to}} post-hatching mortality if apparent survival rates are ranked: chicks < fledglings = adults. We were unable to separate mortality, from dispersal because apparent survival was ranked: chicks (phi(1) = 0. 08) : fledglings (phi(1) = 0. 15) < adults after banding (phi(1) = 0. 59) < adults in later intervals (phi(2 +) = 0. 64). Time since marking models gave improved {{estimates of}} the apparent survival of adults that were higher than return rates in other populations of <b>Kentish</b> <b>Plovers,</b> but lower than estimates of apparent survival for other Charadrius plovers. Sex-biased mating opportunities in <b>Kentish</b> <b>Plovers</b> were not explained by biased sex ratios at hatching or differential apparent survival among adults. Instead, male-biased adult sex ratios were explained, in part, by differential survival of juveniles and by higher encounter rates among adult males ((p) over cap = 0. 84) than females ((p) over cap = 0. 74). Our baseline estimates of apparent survival will assist assessments of population viability for <b>Kentish</b> and Snowy <b>Plovers</b> throughout their geographic range...|$|R
40|$|Sexual size {{dimorphism}} (SSD) {{among adults}} is commonly observed in animals {{and is considered}} to be adaptive. However, the ontogenic emergence of SSD, i. e. the timing of divergence in body size between males and females, has only recently received attention. It is widely acknowledged that the ontogeny of SSD may differ between species, but it remains unclear how variable the ontogeny of SSD is within species. <b>Kentish</b> <b>Plovers</b> Charadrius alexandrinus and Snowy Plovers C. nivosus are closely related wader species that exhibit similar, moderate (c. 4 %), male-biased adult SSD. To assess when SSD emerges we recorded tarsus length variation among 759 offspring in four populations of these species. Tarsus length of chicks was measured on the day of hatching and up to three times on recapture before fledging. In one population (Mexico, Snowy Plovers), males and females differed in size from the day of hatching, whereas growth rates differed between the sexes in two populations (Turkey and United Arab Emirates, both <b>Kentish</b> <b>Plovers).</b> In contrast, a fourth population (Cape Verde, <b>Kentish</b> <b>Plovers)</b> showed no significant SSD in juveniles. Our results suggest that adult SSD can emerge at different stages of development (prenatal, postnatal and post-juvenile) in different populations of the same species. We discuss the proximate mechanisms that may underlie these developmental differences...|$|R

40|$|We studied reuse of nesting scrapes within {{breeding}} seasons by <b>Kentish</b> <b>Plovers</b> (Charadrius alexandrinus) in an inland lake {{of southern}} Spain over six years. Overall, 5. 6 % of original nests were reused at least once. We tested whether nest reuse is adaptive, but found {{no differences in}} breeding success between those pairs that reused nests and those that did not.

5000|$|The <b>Kentish</b> <b>plover</b> (Charadrius alexandrinus) {{is a small}} {{cosmopolitan}} shorebird (40-44 g) of {{the family}} Charadriidae that breeds {{on the shores of}} saline lakes, lagoons, and coasts, populating sand dunes, marshes, semi-arid desert, and tundra. Both male and female birds have pale plumages with a white underside, grey/brown back, dark legs and a dark bill, however additionally the male birds also exhibit very dark incomplete breast bands, and dark markings either side of their head, therefore the <b>Kentish</b> <b>plover</b> is regarded as sexually dimorphic ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Kentish</b> <b>plovers</b> are {{territorial}} shorebirds; {{the male}} usually has a territory and attracts females with courtship displays. The parents are actively defending their nest territories from predators by chasing, fighting or posturing them. When approached by predators {{in close proximity}} to the nest, the <b>Kentish</b> <b>plovers</b> quickly run away from the nest and start doing distraction displays to focus the predator's attention on themselves and lure them away from the nest. These displays include calling or crawling on the ground flapping their wings. Males tend to be more aggressive than females. When a plover's territory has been invaded, it invades a neighboring family's territory. This is when fights between males frequently occur because the plovers see their broods threatened. During such fights, it occurs that chicks get injured or even killed. When approached by a predator, chicks usually try to find a spot where they can hide, crouch down and stay motionless to remain unseen. When they are older, they try to run away with their parents.|$|R

50|$|<b>Kentish</b> <b>plovers</b> have an {{extremely}} wide geographical distribution and their habitats vary not just spatially but environmentally too. They {{are known to}} reside and breed in multiple types of habitat, from desert with ground temperatures reaching 50 °C to tundra. The distribution of this species’ breeding areas covers Europe, Asia and Africa,). In Europe, populations are typically found in the west, however {{there was once a}} breeding population in Hungary, however <b>Kentish</b> <b>plovers</b> no longer breed there. In Africa, populations are found on the southern coast of Senegal and along the Northern coast of the Mediterranean, and the Red Sea coast. The breeding area continues along the Arabian Peninsula, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Bahrain in the Middle East. Small populations can be found on islands too, such as the Cape Verde archipelago, the Canary Islands, and the Azores. Some populations do not migrate, such as the Maio (Cape Verde) population, however other populations can migrate reasonable distances, for example, plovers that spend winter in North Africa have been known to migrate to Turkey and Greece in the spring. Some birds breeding in western Europe are not known to travel very far, just within Europe, however some do travel, mainly to Western Africa.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} the daily body mass changes in incubating female <b>Kentish</b> <b>Plovers</b> Charadrius alexandrinus. We {{found that the}} body mass of females decreased over the day. The change in body mass was significant both from morning to midday (median decrease: 3. 36 %), and from morning to afternoon (8. 40 %). We suggest two reasons for this decrease: depletion of fat reserves and the evaporation of water from body tissues. These changes may either indicate a physiological cost of incubation, {{or they may be}} the result of a strategic body mass regulation...|$|R
40|$|Birds {{are thought}} to choose nest sites that meet two main functions: {{providing}} security to both nest contents and incubating adults, and providing an appropriate microclimate for incubation. Many shorebirds nest in sites with no or little cover. In a lake in southern Spain, nearly 70 % of the nests of <b>Kentish</b> <b>plovers,</b> Charadrius alexandrinus, were in sites {{with little or no}} cover, where ambient temperatures might be more than 50 °C during very hot days, thus causing the incubating adults to suffer from heat stress. We tested the hypothesis that <b>Kentish</b> <b>plovers</b> nest mainly in exposed sites because this may allow the incubating birds to detect approaching predators early, and thus to reduce predation risk. When we occluded the view that incubating adults had from their nests, they took longer to detect approaching predators than when the view was unrestricted. Incubating adults were also more frequently killed by mammals in covered than in exposed nests. Females that nested in covered sites were in lower body condition than those nesting in exposed sites, possibly because they were unable to withstand the high ambient temperatures in exposed sites. Thus, the benefits of thermally favourable nest sites are reduced by the constraints of predation risk. © 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine whether the {{energetic}} costs of reproduction explain offspring desertion by female shorebirds, as is suggested by the differential parental capacity hypothesis. A prediction of the hypothesis is that, in species with biparental incubation in which females desert from brood care after hatching, the body condition of females should decline after laying to a point at which their body reserves are too low for continuing parental care. We tested this prediction on <b>Kentish</b> <b>plovers</b> (Charadrius alexandrinus) in which both sexes incubate but the females desert from brood care before the chicks fledge. We found no changes in either the body masses or body compositions of both individual male and female plovers from early incubation and throughout early chick rearing. Furthermore, the timing of brood desertion by females was not affected by their body condition. Neither did we field gender differences in the energetic costs of incubation. There were no differences in the timing of brood desertion between experimental and control females in an experiment in which we lengthened or shortened the duration of incubation by one week. These results indicate that energetic costs do not explain offspring desertion by female <b>Kentish</b> <b>plovers</b> and that the needs of chicks for parental care rather than cumulative investment by females is what determines the timing of brood desertion...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Kentish</b> <b>plover</b> is {{classified}} as Least Concern on the Red List Category {{because it has a}} very large population range. It is not near the threshold for ‘Vulnerable’ under the population size (<10,000 mature individuals with a constant decline reaching >10% within the next 10 years or three generations), since the global population is estimated being very large with 100,000 - 499,999 mature individuals. A closer estimate, needing further verification, is that the population size lies between 290,000 and 460,000 individuals. Moreover, the <b>Kentish</b> <b>plover</b> does not reach the threshold for being ‘Vulnerable’ on a level of range size (the area of occurrence being <20,000km2 in combination with a decline of population size, habitat area/quality or range size) because it is distributed over an area of 70,800,000 km2.

40|$|A small {{percentage}} (4. 5 %) of females <b>Kentish</b> <b>plovers</b> (Charadrius alexandrinus) observed breeding in southern Spain expressed a plumage trait characteristic of males: the forecrown (frontal) black bar. The expression of this male tra{{it may be}} age-related, and reversible, i. e., within individuals it may be present in some years but not in other years. Females with frontal bars were not in better condition and nor did they initiate breeding earlier than in years when they lacked frontal bars. Nevertheless, when females had frontal bars they laid larger eggs. I suggest that the frontal bar on females could be an epiphenomenon resulting from hormonal imbalances of females as they age. © Dt.
