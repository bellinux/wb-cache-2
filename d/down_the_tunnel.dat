5|$|Reports were sketchy {{initially}} – television pictures {{broadcast on}} ITV showed Stein, {{who appeared to}} be both conscious and alert, being carried <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> by a number of police officers, with commentator Brian Moore speculating that he had been overcome with the emotion of the result. BBC Radio commentator Peter Jones (who had no access to the television pictures and was relying on information from other people in the press box) also speculated that the tension of the result and the night had led to Stein's collapse. Willie Miller, the Scottish captain on the night in the absence of Graeme Souness, was informed by Martin Tyler of ITV Sport during the post-match interview that Stein had collapsed, with Alex Ferguson entering the dressing room to tell them that Stein had suffered a heart attack.|$|E
25|$|The {{final blow}} to the project was a stock market crash which caused investors to {{withdraw}} support. It is unclear that such a system could have been practical for a large-scale subway network. After the project was shut <b>down,</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> entrance was sealed and the station, built in part of {{the basement of the}} Rogers Peet Building, was reclaimed for other uses. The entire building was lost to fire in 1898. In 1912, workers excavating for the present-day BMT Broadway Line dug into the old Beach tunnel; today, no part of this line remains as the tunnel was completely within the limits of the present day City Hall Station under Broadway.|$|E
25|$|In the 2010 FIFA World Cup quarter-final {{match against}} Ghana, {{the score was}} 1–1 {{at the end of}} {{regulation}} time and the game went into extra time. Late in extra time, Ghana sent a free kick into the box; Suárez blocked Stephen Appiah's shot on the goal line. He then blocked Dominic Adiyiah's goalbound header with his hands to prevent a last minute Ghana goal, committing a professional foul to save what would have been the game winner and was sent off. Ghana's Asamoah Gyan missed the resulting penalty spot kick and Suárez, who had stopped to watch, celebrated the miss before heading <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Ghana subsequently lost the match 4–2 in the penalty shoot-out, and Uruguay advanced to the semi-finals.|$|E
5000|$|The {{station is}} {{reputed to be}} haunted by the ghost of the {{daughter}} of an Egyptian Pharaoh called Amen-ra which would appear and scream so loudly that the noise would carry <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnels</b> to adjoining stations.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Muntapa <b>Tunnel</b> is a {{concrete}} railway <b>tunnel</b> located on <b>the</b> Cooyar railway line, a former branch line linking Oakey to Cooyar in <b>the</b> eastern Darling <b>Downs.</b> <b>The</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{is one of}} a small number built on a branch line and it is <b>the</b> only <b>tunnel</b> in Queensland that crosses between the inland and coastal sides of the Great Dividing Range. It was opened in 1913.|$|R
50|$|The final {{scenario}} {{plays out}} as a massive earthquake threatens to bring <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnels</b> around <b>the</b> group, and they must exit the caverns within four hours or perish in the ensuing collapse. The labyrinth is a difficult test for characters without equipment and spells, and challenges the players' wits and role-playing ability {{rather than focusing on}} traditional combat.|$|R
2500|$|The reserve members {{leave the}} parade formation, run <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{onto the field}} and move into the stands to watch pregame. The {{remaining}} band members then enter the tunnel and arrange themselves into 'entry lines' {{for the start of}} the pregame performance. The drum major then proceeds to the lower mouth of the tunnel signaling to the stadium announcer that the band is ready. The Michigan Stadium and Michigan Marching Band announcer, Carl Grapentine, announces the entrance of the band in his signature baritone: [...] "Ladies and Gentlemen, presenting the Michigan Marching Band! Baaaand, take the field!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Four {{kinds of}} den have been described; simple earth dens with one {{entrance}} (usually remodeled striped hyena or porcupine dens); complex cavernous earth dens {{with more than}} one entrance; simple cavernous dens excavated under or between rocks; and complex cavernous dens with several other dens in the vicinity, some of which are interconnected. Dens are typically located under dense scrub or on the banks of dry rivers or creeks. The entrance to a dhole den can be almost vertical, with a sharp turn three to four feet <b>down.</b> <b>The</b> <b>tunnel</b> opens into an antechamber, from which extends more than one passage. Some dens may have up to six entrances leading up to [...] of interconnecting tunnels. These [...] "cities" [...] may be developed over many generations of dholes, and are shared by the clan females when raising young together. Like African wild dogs and dingoes, dholes will avoid killing prey close to their dens.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the round}} of 16 against South Korea, Suárez scored both goals in a 2–1 win. His second broke a tie in the 80th minute when he dribbled around a defender and curled a [...] "spectacular shot" [...] in off the far post; Suárez was again named Man of the Match. This win put Uruguay through to the quarter-finals {{for the first time}} since 1970. In the quarter-final against Ghana, the score was 1–1 at the end of {{regulation}} and the match went into extra time. Late in extra time, Ghana sent a free-kick into the box, and Suárez blocked Stephen Appiah's shot on the goal line. He then blocked Dominic Adiyiah's goalbound header with his hands, committing a professional foul to save what would have been the game winner and was sent off. Asamoah Gyan hit the crossbar with the ensuing penalty kick and Suárez, who had stopped to watch, celebrated the miss before heading <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Uruguay won the shootout 4–2 and advanced to the semi-finals.|$|E

50|$|It was at Wingfield Manor where Mary Queen of Scots {{was imprisoned}} in 1569 then again in 1584 when her {{attempted}} rescue by Anthony Babington ended in disaster. His {{plan was to}} lead her <b>down</b> through <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> to <b>the</b> cellar at the inn, where horses were waiting {{to take her to}} safety. Babington went <b>down</b> through <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> from Oakerthorpe, but he got caught. For his crime he was beheaded at Lincoln's Inn in 1586. Mary was taken to Fotheringay and beheaded the same year.|$|R
25|$|On 7 January 2010, a Brussels–London Eurostar broke <b>down</b> in <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b> <b>The</b> train had 236 {{passengers}} on board and was towed to Ashford; other trains {{that had not yet}} reached <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> were turned back.|$|R
2500|$|The other nine commandos {{had set out}} for {{the rear}} of the power plant. Seven of them entered the {{machinery}} hall, leaving two commandos to guard the exit. The commandos who entered the power plant discovered that the Germans had left the control room. Only a Norwegian engineer was on duty. Sergeant Smith and Private Fairclough were detailed to plant their explosives amongst the machinery in the power house, while the other commandos located the place where the Norwegian work force worked and slept. The workers were gathered together and ordered to leave the power plant via an access tunnel over [...] in length, which was also the only land route between the power plant and the villages in the fjord. On their approach to the tunnel a German guard was killed by Granlund and another ran off <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> to raise the alarm. To delay any German reinforcements, the commandos left smoke bombs in the tunnel. By this time the commandos in the power plant had set their plastic explosives with 10-minute delay fuses on the plant's turbines and generators.|$|E
2500|$|Rypien {{began the}} 2010–11 NHL {{season on the}} injured reserve once again, missing {{the first two games}} with an upper body injury. After {{returning}} to the line-up, Rypien became infamously involved in a fan-related incident during an away game at the Xcel Energy Center against the Minnesota Wild on October 19, 2010. After fighting opposing forward Brad Staubitz in the first period, the two players met again in the second period and were prepared to fight before being restrained by game officials. Before walking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> towards the Canucks' dresing room, Wild fan James Engquist called towards Rypien, [...] "way to be a professional", while clapping. Rypien grabbed Engquist by his jersey before letting go and walking away. Rypien was suspended indefinitely pending an in-person disciplinary hearing about the altercation. The NHL then suspended Rypien for six games and fined the Canucks $25,000, while NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman called Engquist to apologize and offered him dinner and tickets to another game. In response, the fan stated that, although he had not yet hired a lawyer, he would be [...] "definitely seeking legal representation." [...] Rypien meanwhile told media he had apologized to his team and the league, describing his actions as [...] "inexcusable." ...|$|E

60|$|One day, {{some three}} weeks after Arthur had gone, Angela strolled <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> walk, now, in the height of summer, almost dark with {{the shade of the}} lime-trees, and settled herself on one of the stone seats under Caresfoot's staff.|$|E

50|$|The Martian heat-ray effect {{showing the}} bubbling, melting walls of <b>the</b> {{underground}} <b>tunnels</b> {{was created by}} shooting a large tub of boiling oatmeal from above, colored red with food coloring and lit with red lights. The cooled, bubbled-up effect on some areas of <b>the</b> blasted <b>tunnel</b> walls was created by first using inflated balloons pinned to <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> walls. In film tests they looked like balloons stuck to the walls, so the effects crew tried smaller inflated latex condoms. Further testing showed these looked much more convincing, and the crew wound up inflating more than 3,000 and then sticking them to portions of <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> set's walls; in some shots, the condoms can be seen moving slightly as the Martian mutants rush <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnels.</b>|$|R

60|$|There was one five-minute {{interval}} of excitement when, far <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> through the forest, {{we saw a}} light gleaming. The engineer {{said there was no}} house there, that it must be a fire. But we did not slacken our speed, and gradually the leaping flames grew larger and redder until we were upon them.|$|E
60|$|A week later, Thirlwell {{was walking}} <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{when he saw}} {{one or two of}} the men and Driscoll shoring up the roof. Drummond was helping, but a stone fell on him and he sat down. There was no light except the flicker of the lamps in the men's hats and they did not see Thirlwell.|$|E
60|$|In {{five minutes}} a breach appeared, {{through which they}} poured tumultuously. It was hopeless to {{withstand}} that onslaught of so vast a number. Fighting desperately, we were driven <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> and through the doors that were opened to us, into the first court of the temple. By furious efforts we managed to close these doors and block them with stones and earth. But this did not avail us long, for, bringing brushwood and dry grass, they built a fire against them that soon caught the thick cedar wood of which they were made.|$|E
50|$|During construction, {{the site}} was left {{unguarded}} at night. Unauthorized entry was discouraged by a tall aluminum-sheathed wall erected around the open ground by the New York City Transit Authority—but this hardly deterred local graffiti writers from boosting one another over it and climbing <b>down</b> into <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> below. <b>Down</b> inside <b>the</b> <b>tunnel,</b> there were four subway tracks (uptown and downtown IND and BMT tracks on two levels; downtown tracks on upper level, uptown tracks on lower level) constructed on two levels about 100 ft underneath the park, creating something of a subterranean monkey-house environment for invading street kids to climb around and scrawl graffiti on.|$|R
50|$|Buckler, meanwhile, {{has taken}} the entire Guosim shrew force {{and most of the}} able-bodied creatures from Redwall, {{planning}} to storm Althier, as they now know its location thanks to the warrior Axtel. Unfortunately, {{by the time they get}} there, both the young ones and the Ravagers have gotten far <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnels,</b> leaving no sign as to where they have gone. The group searches Althier from end to end with no success; during the search, Diggs becomes separated from the rest and is soon lost in Althier without a torch.|$|R
50|$|On 21 February at 21:30, Malinta Hill reacted like {{a volcano}} when several detonations in quick {{succession}} tore it asunder. The Japanese trapped inside had blown themselves up, and after the explosions and rock falls ceased, some 50 Japanese exited the cave to attack, the Americans shot them down. Two nights later, a similar attack happened. Finally, engineers went to work, poured large quantities of gasoline <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnels</b> and set them afire, they then sealed the tunnels' entrances. After some time, silence finally reigned inside Malinta Hill.|$|R
60|$|The stair {{led to a}} tunnel, and a {{few paces}} <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{was one of the}} usual curtain-hung doorways, a glance at which {{told me that it was}} the same where I had been a witness of that terrible scene by the leaping flame. I {{recognised}} the pattern of the curtain, and the sight of it brought the whole event vividly before my eyes, and made me tremble even at its memory. Ayesha entered the tomb (for it was a tomb), and we followed her--I, for one, rejoicing that the mystery of the place was about to be cleared up, and yet afraid to face its solution.|$|E
60|$|And {{here the}} modern Italian spirit came out: the endless pity for the ignorant. It is only slackness. The pity makes the ignorant more ignorant, {{and makes the}} Risveglio daily more impossible. If {{somebody}} let a bottle buzz round the ears of the dirty-breast, and whipped the shawl {{from the head of}} the pert young madam and sent her flying <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> with a flea in her ear, we might get some attention and they might find a little self-respect. But no: pity them, poor ignoranti, while they pull life down and devour it like vermin. Pity them! What they need is not pity but prods: they and all their myriad of likes.|$|E
60|$|I {{found that}} we were in a {{subterranean}} tunnel, which appeared to extend into the bowels of the earth. It was so high that I could stand erect with ease, and the old lichen-blotched stones which lined the walls told of its great age. At the spot where we stood the ceiling had fallen in and the original passage been blocked, but a cutting had been made from this point through the chalk to form the narrow burrow along which we had come. This cutting appeared to be quite recent, for a mound of debris and some trenching tools were still lying in the passage. My companion, taper in hand, started off <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>tunnel,</b> and I followed at his heels, stepping over the great stones which had fallen from the roof or the walls, and now obstructed the path.|$|E
50|$|Fort Gordon, to {{the south}} of Fort Ballance, {{consisted}} of one gun-pit and magazines. It is now almost completely buried as are the smaller positions lower <b>down</b> <b>the</b> spur. <b>Tunnel</b> entrances have been filled in.|$|R
50|$|The utilidors {{are built}} on 9 acre, and the floor plan is a circle with a path <b>down</b> <b>the</b> middle; <b>the</b> <b>tunnel</b> walls are {{color-coded}} to make it simple for cast members to determine their location. The utilidors can be accessed from a main tunnel entrance located behind Fantasyland, or through unmarked doors throughout the Magic Kingdom. Magic Kingdom cast members park about 1 mi away and are transported via a Disney bus to <b>the</b> <b>tunnel.</b> Some shops, restaurants and attractions have {{direct access to the}} utilidors.|$|R
