After four deadlocked meetings of the Security Council, Boutros-Ghali suspended his candidacy and became the only U.N. Secretary-General ever to be denied a second term by a veto.|$|E

2500|$|Myers {{was criticized}} from both {{religious}} and non-religious quarters. The Catholic League accused Myers of anti-Catholic bigotry, described his proposal {{as a threat}} to desecrate what Catholics hold to be the Body of Christ, and sent a letter asking the University of Minnesota and the Minnesota State Legislature to take action against Myers. The Catholic League argued that, as the Pharyngula website was accessible via a link from the University of Minnesota's website, it should be bound by the university's code of conduct, which requires faculty to be [...] "respectful, fair and civil" [...] when dealing with others. Joe Foley, a member of the Board of the Secular Student Alliance, wrote on the organization's website that Myers had [...] "crossed the line" [...] from [...] "playful satire" [...] to [...] "masturbatory condescension". Foley concluded, [...] "if open-minded believers are willing to <b>join</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> polite dialogue, we need to be ready to welcome them with more than ridicule and pranks." ...|$|E

"And {{when these}} men heard that Belisarius {{was coming and}} was not far away, they {{wrote a letter to}} him which ran as follows: [...] "Once more Chosroes, as you {{yourself}} doubtless know, has taken the field against the Romans, bringing a much greater army than formerly; and where he is purposing to go is not yet evident, except indeed that we hear he is very near, and that he has injured no place, but is always moving ahead. But come to us as quickly as possible, if indeed you are able to escape detection by the army of the enemy, in order that you yourself may be safe for the emperor, and that you may <b>join</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> guarding Hierapolis." [...] Such was the message of the letter. But Belisarius, not approving the advice given, came to the place called Europum, which is on the River Euphrates. From there he sent about in all directions and began to gather his army, and there he established his camp; and the officers in Hierapolis he answered with the following words: [...] "If, now, Chosroes is proceeding against any other peoples, and not against subjects of the Romans, this plan of yours is well considered and insures the greatest possible degree of safety; for it is great folly for those who have the opportunity of remaining quiet and being rid of trouble to enter into any unnecessary danger; but if, immediately after departing from here, this barbarian is going to fall upon some other territory of the Emperor Justinian, and that an exceptionally good one, but without any guard of soldiers, be assured that to perish valorously is better in every way than to be saved without a fight. For this would justly be called not salvation but treason. But come as quickly as possible to Europum, where, after collecting the whole army, I hope to deal with the enemy as God permits." [...] And when the officers saw this message, they took courage, and leaving there Justus with some few men in order to guard Hierapolis, all the others {{with the rest of the}} army came to Europum." ...|$|E
