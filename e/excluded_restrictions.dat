Study Objective: The study was designed to create an algorithm that would better predict the absence of restriction in such patients. Design: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. Methods: A cohort of consecutive adults that underwent complete pulmonary function testing from 2002 - 2004 was analyzed. The data was randomly split into two groups to allow for derivation and then validation of a predictive formula. Patients were randomly assigned into either a “derivation ” or “validation ” group. In the derivation group, stepwise logistic regression was used to determine a formula and optimal cut-off value for the variable with the best discriminative capacity. The formula was applied subsequently to the validation group to test the results and compared to previously published formula. Results: The study group contained 766 patients. We determined that the variable with the highest association with TLC was [(FEV 1 /FVC) % predicted/FVC % predicted]. A value of � 1. 11 was found to be the maximal cutoff to predict the absence of restriction. The formula was applied to a validation group (n= 397) and performed better than prior published algorithm with a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 95 %, 44 %, 22 %, and 98 %, respectively. Conclusion: Our formula performs superior to the previously published algorithms in patients with concomitant low FVC and obstruction to <b>exclude</b> <b>restriction...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{design a}} spirometry-based {{algorithm}} to predict pulmonary restrictive impairment {{and reduce the}} number of patients undergoing unnecessary lung volume testing. Design: Two prospective studies of 259 consecutive patients and 265 consecutive patients used to derive and validate the algorithm, respectively. Setting: A pulmonary function laboratory of a tertiary care hospital. Patients: Consecutive adults referred to the laboratory for lung volume measurements and spirometry. Measurements: The sensitivity of the algorithm for predicting pulmonary restriction and the cost savings associated with its use. Results: Total lung capacity correlated strongly with FVC (r 0. 66) and showed an inverse correlation with the FEV 1 /FVC ratio (r 0. 41). According to the algorithm, only patients with an FVC 55 % required lung volume measurements following spirometry. The algorithm had a high sensitivity for predicting restriction and a high negative predictive value (NPV) for <b>excluding</b> <b>restriction</b> (sensitivity, 96 %; NPV, 98 %). The diagnostic properties of the algorithm were reproducible in the validation study.

However, in military systems, performance concerns generally dominate initial development. Economic refinements to second and third generation equipments result from competitive pressures after functional requirements have stabilized. Satellite communications terminal requirements have not been stable primarily because economically attractive solutions to satellite jamming and physical attack vulnerabilities have not been collectively identified. Recognizing the incomplete resolution of the threat issue, this paper makes a forecast of what second and third generation ultra high frequency (UHF) satellite terminals could be like.

Factors that affect stability are length and flexibility of the linkers and π-stacking of the stilbene moiety on the adjacent base pair. The crystal structure of the hairpin d(GT 4 G) −Sd 2 −d(CA 4 C) was determined at 1. 5 Å resolution. The conformations of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit differ both in the linker and the stem portions. One of them shows a planar stilbene that is stacked on the adjacent G:C base pair. The other displays considerable rotation between the phenyl rings and an unprecedented edge-to-face orientation of stilbene and base pair. The observation of considerable variations in the conformation of the Sd moiety in the crystal structure allows us to <b>exclude</b> <b>restriction</b> of motion {{as the reason for}} the absence of Sd photoisomerization in the hairpins.

40|$|Nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD) -labeled lipids {{are popular}} {{fluorescent}} membrane probes. However, {{the understanding of}} {{important aspects of the}} photophysics of NBD remains incomplete, including the observed shift in the emission spectrum of NBD-lipids to longer wavelengths following excitation at the red edge of the absorption spectrum (red-edge excitation shift or REES). REES of NBD-lipids in membrane environments has been previously interpreted as reflecting restricted mobility of solvent surrounding the fluorophore. However, this requires a large change in the dipole moment (Dm) of NBD upon excitation. Previous calculations of the value of Dm of NBD in the literature have been carried out using outdated semi-empirical methods, leading to conflicting values. Using up-to-date density functional theory methods, we recalculated the value of Dm and verified that it is rather small (B 2 D). Fluorescence measurements confirmed that the value of REES is B 16 nm for 1, 2 -dioleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 - phospho-L-serine-N-(NBD) (NBD-PS) in dioleoylphosphatidylcholine vesicles. However, the observed shift is independent of both the temperature and the presence of cholesterol and is therefore insensitive to the mobility and hydration of the membrane. Moreover, red-edge excitation leads to an increased contribution of the decay component with a shorter lifetime, whereas time-resolved emission spectra of NBD-PS displayed an atypical blue shift following excitation. This <b>excludes</b> <b>restrictions</b> to solvent relaxation as the cause of the measured REES and TRES of NBD, pointing instead to the heterogeneous transverse location of probes as the origin of these effects. The latter hypothesis was confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations, from which the calculated heterogeneity of the hydration and location of NBD correlated with the measured fluorescence lifetimes/REES. Globally, our combination of theoretical and experiment-based techniques has led to a considerably improved understanding of the photophysics of NBD and a reinterpretation of its REES in particular...|$|R
