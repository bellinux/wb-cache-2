25|$|In {{order to}} follow his argumentation and to {{evaluate}} Bohr's response, it is convenient {{to refer to the}} experimental apparatus illustrated in figure A. A beam of light perpendicular to the X axis propagates in the direction z and encounters a screen S1 with a narrow (relative to the wavelength of the ray) slit. After having passed through the slit, the wave function diffracts with an angular opening that causes it to encounter a second screen S2 with two slits. The successive propagation of the wave results {{in the formation of the}} <b>interference</b> <b>figure</b> on the final screenF.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} Einstein brings into play the first screen {{as well and}} argues as follows: since the {{incident}} particles have velocities (practically) perpendicular to the screen S1, and since {{it is only the}} interaction with this screen that can cause a deflection from the original direction of propagation, by the law of conservation of impulse which implies that the sum of the impulses of two systems which interact is conserved, if the incident particle is deviated toward the top, the screen will recoil toward the bottom and vice versa. In realistic conditions the mass of the screen is so large that it will remain stationary, but, in principle, it is possible to measure even an infinitesimal recoil. If we imagine taking the measurement of the impulse of the screen in the direction X after every single particle has passed, we can know, {{from the fact that the}} screen will be found recoiled toward the top (bottom), whether the particle in question has been deviated toward the bottom or top, and therefore through which slit in S2 the particle has passed. But since the determination of the direction of the recoil of the screen after the particle has passed cannot influence the successive development of the process, we will still have an <b>interference</b> <b>figure</b> on the screenF. The interference takes place precisely because the state of the system is the superposition of two states whose wave functions are non-zero only near one of the two slits. On the other hand, if every particle passes through only the slit b or the slit c, then the set of systems is the statistical mixture of the two states, which means that interference is not possible. If Einstein is correct, then there is a violation of the principle of indeterminacy.|$|E

More simply, in ordinary cross polarized light, the plate can be used to distinguish the orientation of the optical indicatrix relative to crystal elongation – that is, whether the mineral is [...] "length slow" [...] or [...] "length fast" [...] – based on whether the visible interference colors increase or decrease by one order when the plate is added. A slightly more complex procedure allows for a tint plate to be used in conjunction with <b>interference</b> <b>figure</b> techniques to allow measurement of the optic angle of the mineral.

40|$|The {{electro-optic}} effect in uniaxial crystals for light propagating near the optic axis with any polarization has been analyzed. The passive and the electrically induced birefringences and {{the rotation of}} polarization direction in crystals have been calculated, and the conoscopic <b>interference</b> <b>figures</b> under orthogonal polariscopes for different polarizer directions have been plotted. The extinction areas caused by the rotation of polarization direction in crystals change with the polarizer direction, but the two heads of the induced optical axes do not vary, which are always on the induced principal axis with bigger refractive index. The directions of polariscopes are always extinction, and the +/- 45 degrees directions with polarizer are always complete transmission.

2500|$|At {{the passage}} through the two slits of the second screen S2, the wave aspects of the process become essential.

It is also important to note that any experiment designed to evidence the [...] "corpuscular" [...] aspects of the process at the passage of the screen S2 (which, in this case, reduces to the determination of which slit the particle has passed through) inevitably destroys the wave aspects, implies the disappearance of the <b>interference</b> <b>figure</b> and the emergence of two concentrated spots of diffraction which confirm our knowledge of the trajectory followed by the particle.|$|E

5000|$|The two Nicol prisms (occasionally {{referred}} to as nichols) of the petrographic microscope have their polarizing planes oriented perpendicular to one another. When only an isotropic material such as air, water, or glass exists between the filters, all light is blocked, but most crystalline materials and minerals change the polarizing light directions, allowing some of the altered light {{to pass through the}} analyzer to the viewer.

50|$|Ulexite is colorless and nonpleochroic in thin {{sections}} {{with low}} relief. Being triclinic, ulexite is optically biaxial. <b>Interference</b> <b>figures</b> yield addition on the concave {{side of the}} isogyers, causing ulexite to be biaxial positive. Ulexite has a high 2V that ranges between 73° - 78° and a maximum birefringence of up to 0.0300 (Anthony et al., 2005). According to Moore and Potter (1963), {{the orientation of the}} fibers around the c-axis is completely random based on the variations in extinctions viewed under cross polarization. Ulexite displays polysynthetic twinning parallel to the elongation, along {010} and {100} (Murdoch, 1940). In thin sections cut parallel to the fibers, ulexite grains display both length-fast and length-slow orientations in equal quantities because the intermediate axis (y) of the indicatrix is roughly parallel to the elongation of the fibers along the crystallographic c-axis (Moore and Potter, 1963).|$|R
40|$|Using a new {{formalism}} involving projection {{from the}} sphere of directions to the stereographic plane, and associated complex variables, explicit formulae are obtained for the two refractive indices and polarizations in optically anisotropic crystals that are both dichroic (absorbing) and chiral (optically active). This enables three types of polarization singularity to be classified and explored: singular axes, which are degeneracies where the two refractive indices are equal, and which for a transpar-ent non-chiral crystal condense pairwise onto the optic axes; C points, where the polarization is purely circular (right- or left-handed), with topological index + 1, + 12 or + 1 4 and whose positions are independent of the chirality; and L lines, where the polarization is purely linear, dividing direction space into regions with right-and left-handedness.

Allman and Donnay (1973) calculated the cell dimensions to be a 8.922(4), b 6.081(3), c 19.432 (9) Å. The color of julgoldite is usually a deep lustrous black, and it has a hardness of 4.5 and cleavage on the a-axis {100} (Moore, 1971). It has a greenish-olive powdery streak with a blue tinge (Moore, 1971). Under the petrographic microscope, a thin section of the mineral will display brilliant <b>interference</b> <b>figures</b> in greens or blues (Moore, 1971).

50|$|The scapolite limestones {{and contact}} {{metamorphic}} rocks. As silicates rich in calcium, {{it is to}} be expected that these minerals will be found where impure limestones have been crystallized by contact with an igneous magma. Even marialite (the variety richest in soda) occurs in this association, being principally obtained in small crystals lining cavities in ejected blocks of crystalline limestone at Vesuvius and the craters of the Eifel in Germany. Scapolite and wernerite are far more common at the contacts of limestone with intrusive masses. The minerals that accompany them are calcite, epidote, vesuvianite, garnet, wollastonite, diopside and amphibole. The scapolites are colorless, flesh-colored, grey or greenish; occasionally they are nearly black from the presence of very small enclosures of graphitic material. They are not in very perfect crystals, though sometimes incomplete octagonal sections are visible; the tetragonal cleavage, strong double refraction and uniaxial <b>interference</b> <b>figure</b> distinguish them readily from other minerals. Commonly they weather to micaceous aggregate, but sometimes an isotropic substance of unknown nature is seen replacing them. In crystalline limestones and calc-silicate rocks they occur in small and usually inconspicuous grains mingled with the other components of the rock. Large, nearly idiomorphic crystals are sometimes found in argillaceous rocks (altered calcareous shales) that have suffered thermal metamorphism. In the Pyrenees there are extensive outcrops of limestone penetrated by igneous rocks described as ophites (varieties of diabase) and lherzolites (peridotites). At the contacts scapolite occurs in a great number of places, both in the limestones and in the calcareous shales that accompany them. In some of these rocks large crystals of one of the scapolite minerals (an inch or two in length) occur, usually as octagonal prisms with imperfect terminations. In others the mineral is found in small irregular grains. It is sometimes clear, but often crowded with minute enclosures of augite, tourmaline, biotite and other minerals, such as constitute the surrounding matrix. From these districts also a black variety is well known, filled with minute graphitic enclosures, often exceedingly small and rendering the mineral nearly opaque. The names couzeranite and dipyre are often given to this kind of scapolite. Apparently the presence of chlorine in small quantities, which may often be detected in limestones, to some extent determines the formation of the mineral.|$|E
