40|$|Abstract. We present ROSAT PSPC and HRI {{observations}} of the galactic wind from the starburst galaxy M 82. X-ray emission from the wind is detected to a distance of ∼ 6 kpc from {{the plane of the}} galaxy. Making use of the PSPC’s mixture of good spatial and spectral characteristics, we separate point source and diffuse emission, and investigate the spectral variation of the diffuse emission through the wind. The intrinsic X-ray luminosity of the wind in the 0. 1 - 2. 4 keV band is found to be approximately 1. 9 × 10 40 erg s − 1 outside the immediate vicinity of the nucleus. The temperature of the diffuse emission is found to decrease weakly from ∼ 0. 6 keV to ∼ 0. 4 keV along the minor axis, whilst the inferred gas density drops as z − 0. 5 and z − 0. 8 along the northern and southern minor axes respectively. We compare these results with those expected from two simple models for the emission: Chevalier & Clegg’s adiabatically expanding <b>free</b> <b>wind</b> and emission from shocked clouds in a wind, and find that the emission cannot come from a <b>free</b> <b>wind,</b> but that shock heated clouds could be the source of the emission...|$|R

40|$|The hypernovae (HNe) {{associated}} with Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) {{may have a}} fairly steep energy-velocity distribution, i. e., E(≥β) ∝β^-q for q< 2 and β≥β_o, where β is the velocity of the material and β_o ∼ 0. 1 is the velocity of the slowest ejecta of the HN explosion, both in units {{of the speed of}} light (c). The cosmic ray protons above the second knee but below the ankle may be accelerated by the HN shocks in the velocity range of β∼β_o - 4 β_o. When β≤ 4 β_o, the radius of the shock front to the central engine is very large and the medium decelerating the HN outflow is very likely to be homogeneous. With this argument, we show that for q∼ 1. 7, as inferred from the optical modelling of SN 2003 lw, the stochastic gyroresonant acceleration model can account for the spectrum change of high energy protons around the second knee. The self-magnetized shock acceleration model, however, yields a too much steep spectrum that is inconsistent with the observation unless, the medium surrounding the HN is a <b>free</b> <b>wind</b> holding up to a (unrealistic large) radius ∼ 1 - 10 kpc or alternatively the particle acceleration mainly occurs in a narrow "dense" shell that terminates the <b>free</b> <b>wind</b> at a radius ∼ 10 ^ 19 cm.

40|$|We study winds in high {{redshift}} galaxies {{driven by}} a relativistic cosmic ray (proton) component {{in addition to the}} hot thermal gas component. Cosmic rays (CRs) are likely to be efficiently generated in supernova (SNe) shocks inside galaxies. We obtain solutions of such CR driven <b>free</b> <b>winds</b> in a gravitational potential of the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) form, relevant to galaxies. Cosmic rays naturally provide the extra energy and/or momentum input to the system, needed for a transonic wind solution in a gas with adiabatic index γ = 5 / 3. We show that cosmic rays can effectively drive winds even when the thermal energy of the gas is lost due to radiative cooling. These wind solutions predict an asymptotic wind speed closely related to the circular velocity of the galaxy. Furthermore, the mass outflow rate per unit star formation rate (ηw) is predicted to be ∼ 0. 2 − 0. 5 for massive galaxies, with masses M ∼ 1011 − 1012 M. We show ηw to be inversely proportional to the square of the circular velocity. Magnetic fields at the µG levels are also required in these galaxies to have a significant mass loss. A large ηw for small mass galaxies implies that cosmic ray driven outflows could provide a strong negative feedback to the star formation in dwarf galaxies. Further, our results will also have important implications to the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium. These conclusions are applicable to the class of <b>free</b> <b>wind</b> models where the source region is confined to be within the sonic point...|$|R
40|$|Turbulence in {{the wake}} {{generated}} by airflow over buildings may produce complex airflow patterns in the downwind region. Examples include the recirculating flow and wind deficit areas behind airport buildings and their potential impact on flight conditions at runways. In this study a computational fluid dynamics analysis of the airflow over helicopter hangars was performed, including the turbulent wakes that were generated behind the hangars. The effects of the wakes on landing and departing aircraft on the two runways (18 / 36 and 11 / 29) at Sola were estimated, based {{on a number of}} numerical simulations. With the prevailing wind direction at Sola, the airport hangars cause no effects on aircraft landing and taking off. Strong wind perpendicular to the hangars, is a different scenario and is the most critical one when it comes to wake turbulence. Simulations were therefore performed to study the impact of building wakes under such conditions. The main findings of the analysis are that aviation turbulence at <b>free</b> <b>wind</b> speeds of 20 m/s for both runways are just light to moderate at delimited runway sections behind the hangars for each of the scenarios mentioned. However, when the <b>free</b> <b>wind</b> speed increases from 20 m/s to 30 m/s (from fresh gale to violent storm), the wake turbulence may be severe for both scenarios. However, the unfavourable impact of the NEW hangar on runway 11 / 29 will not be as large as the impact of the OLD hangar on runway 18 / 36, for similar wind conditions.
