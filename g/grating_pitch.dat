40|$|The {{effects of}} {{structural}} design parameters {{on the performance}} of nano-replicated photonic crystal (PC) label-free biosensors were examined by the analysis of simulated reflection spectra of PC structures. The <b>grating</b> <b>pitch,</b> duty, scaled grating height and scaled TiO 2 layer thickness were selected as the design factors to optimize the PC structure. The peak wavelength value (PWV), full width at half maximum of the peak, figure of merit for the bulk and surface sensitivities, and surface/bulk sensitivity ratio were also selected as the responses to optimize the PC label-free biosensor performance. A parametric study showed that the <b>grating</b> <b>pitch</b> was the dominant factor for PWV, and that it had low interaction effects with other scaled design factors. Therefore, we can isolate the effect of <b>grating</b> <b>pitch</b> using scaled design factors. For the design of PC-label free biosensor, one should consider that: (1) the PWV can be measured by the reflection peak measurement instruments, (2) the <b>grating</b> <b>pitch</b> and duty can be manufactured using conventional lithography systems, and (3) the optimum design is less sensitive to the grating height and TiO 2 layer thickness variations in the fabrication process. In this paper, we suggested a design guide for highly sensitive PC biosensor in which one select the <b>grating</b> <b>pitch</b> and duty based on the limitations of the lithography and measurement system, and conduct a multi objective optimization of the grating height and TiO 2 layer thickness for maximizing performance and minimizing the influence of parameter variation. Through multi-objective optimization of a PC structure with a fixed grating height of 550 nm and a duty of 50 %, we obtained a surface FOM of 66. 18 RIU− 1 and an S/B ratio of 34. 8 %, with a grating height of 117 nm and TiO 2 height of 210 nm...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a 3 D touch trigger probe based on Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG). The sensing principle is Bragg equation λ= 2 nΛ. Mutative strain and temperature outside alter both the refractive index (n) and <b>grating</b> <b>pitches</b> (Λ) of the fiber core, so the Bragg wavelength λ will change accordingly. The probe adopts FBG sensor system which has four FBGs provided with same parameter (three as sensor FBG and one as match FBG). Laser beam from broadband light source enter sensor FBGs through one coupler, the reflected light is imported to match FBG via another coupler, eventually captured {{by a high}} precision optoelectronic detector which monitors energy of the laser reflected by match FBG. The tip ball swings when it contact work pieces, and causes rotation of the plank by rigid connection, the displacement of the tip ball will be transferred to strain exerting on sensor FBGs. Consequently the strain results in Bragg wavelength shift of the reflected laser beam. The displacement of the probe leads to shift of Bragg wavelength of the sensor FBG, therefore, results in energy change of reflected light from the matching FBG. The probe based on FBG sensor brings an untouched branch of the application of Fiber grating sensors.
