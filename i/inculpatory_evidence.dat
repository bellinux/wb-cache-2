50|$|Exculpatory {{evidence}} is evidence {{favorable to the}} defendant in a criminal trial that exonerates or tends to exonerate the defendant of guilt. It {{is the opposite of}} <b>inculpatory</b> <b>evidence,</b> which tends to prove guilt.|$|E
50|$|<b>Inculpatory</b> <b>{{evidence}}</b> {{is evidence}} that shows, or tends to show, a person's involvement in an act, or evidence that can establish guilt. In criminal law, the prosecution {{has a duty to}} provide all evidence to the defense, whether it favors the prosecution's case or the defendant's case. Evidence that tends to show a person's innocence is considered exculpatory evidence.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{if a man}} is {{poisoned}} {{to death}} by an overdose of arsenic, {{and a bottle of}} arsenic is found in the purse of his wife, that bottle could be considered <b>inculpatory</b> <b>evidence</b> against his wife. The bottle of arsenic in his wife's purse could also be considered exculpatory evidence, tending to show the man's innocence as far as suicide is concerned.|$|E

The court's ruling and attendant experts' consensus report led to the National Academy of Sciences establishing a panel to develop scientific standards for forensic DNA analysis.|$|R
40|$|Standards {{published}} by the Association of Forensic Science Providers (2009, Standards for the formulation of evaluative forensic science expert opinion, Science & Justice, Vol. 49, pp. 161 – 164) encourage forensic scientists to express their conclusions {{in the form of}} a likelihood ratio (LR), in which the value of the evidence is conveyed verbally or numerically. In this article, we report two experiments (using undergraduates and Mechanical Turk recruits) designed to investigate how much decision makers change their beliefs when presented with evidence in the form of verbal or numeric LRs. In Experiment 1 (N = 494), participants read a summary of a larceny trial containing inculpatory expert testimony in which evidence strength (low, moderate, high) and presentation method (verbal, numerical) varied. In Experiment 2 (N = 411), participants read the same larceny trial, this time including either exculpatory or <b>inculpatory</b> expert <b>evidence</b> that varied in strength (low, high) and presentation method (verbal, numerical). Both studies found a reasonable degree of correspondence in observed belief change resulting from verbal and numeric formats. However, belief change was considerably smaller than Bayesian calculations would predict. In addition, participants presented with evidence weakly supporting guilt tended to “invert” the evidence, thereby counterintuitively reducing their belief in the guilt of the accused. This “weak evidence effect” was most apparent in the verbal presentation conditions of both experiments, but only when the <b>evidence</b> was <b>inculpatory.</b> These findings raise questions about the interpretability of LRs by jurors and appear to support an expectancy-based account of the weak evidence effec...|$|R

50|$|O'Connor v. Ortega, , is a United States Supreme Court {{decision}} on the Fourth Amendment rights of government employees with regard to administrative searches in the workplace, during investigations by supervisors for violations of employee policy rather than by law enforcement for criminal offenses. It was brought by Magno Ortega, a doctor at a California state hospital after his supervisors found allegedly <b>inculpatory</b> <b>evidence</b> in his office {{while he was on}} administrative leave pending an investigation of alleged misconduct. Some of what they uncovered was later used to impeach a witness who testified on his behalf at the hearing where he unsuccessfully appealed his dismissal.|$|E
5000|$|The Court {{held that}} Kyles should be granted a new trial. The Court noted Brady v. Maryland (1963), which {{held that the}} {{suppression}} by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution. The Court also discussed United States v. Bagley (1985) and the reasonable probability of a different result standard. “The {{question is not whether}} the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence, but whether in its absence he received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.” It noted that this test was not a sufficiency of the evidence test. “A defendant need not demonstrate that after discounting the <b>inculpatory</b> <b>evidence</b> in light of the undisclosed evidence, there would not have been enough left to convict." [...] Finally, the Court noted that the evidence must be considered in whole, not piece by piece. Ultimately, the Court found that based on the evidence that was not brought to light, a reasonable juror could have found Kyles not guilty.|$|E
40|$|Microsoft’s Vista (“Vista”) {{can be seen}} as a {{dramatic}} departure from previous versions of the vendor’s operating systems, in terms of security and file systems. This vendor’s technical advances in security have created problems for law enforcement and other computer forensics investigators. This paper will illustrate how changes to Vista’s file systems will impede the retrieval of <b>inculpatory</b> <b>evidence</b> by prosecutors; the discovery of digital evidence on a system is more problematic in a Vista environment. The successful conviction of a defendant is reliant upon a prosecutor effectively demonstrating control, ownership and intent relating to the data found on the perpetrator’s computer. However, a machine running Vista is likely to negatively impact these findings. This paper will seek to guide the forensics investigator through the plethora of Vista operating system changes and provide suggestions for alternative methods of data discovery...|$|E
40|$|The {{programme}} {{of research}} {{described in this}} dissertation examines the potential prejudicial impact of gruesome evidence on mock juror decision making. The dissertation provides {{a model of the}} cognitive and emotional processes by which gruesome evidence can influence mock juror judgments. Five studies will be presented which have examined the influence of gruesome verbal (written) and visual evidence. Four studies utilised mock trial or simulation methodology utilising written trial transcripts and undergraduate students as mock jurors. Results suggest that gruesome evidence can cause emotional reactions in mock jurors and that mock jurors who are exposed to gruesome evidence are more likely to find the defendant culpable (in criminal cases) and liable (in civil cases). The studies evaluated a model which outlines the cognitive and affective processes by which gruesome evidence might influence juror emotion and decision making. Gruesome evidence presented verbally, such as verbal descriptions of the victim&# 146;s injuries, may bias juror decisions toward conviction. Increased estimates of the guilt of the defendant may result when gruesome information is present, especially when the <b>inculpatory</b> <b>evidence</b> is weak overall. Photographic evidence, irrespective of whether this evidence is neutral or gruesome, can increase the likelihood of conviction. Admitting gruesome photographic evidence, rather than excluding this evidence, may increase the inculpatory value that jurors ascribe to prosecutorial evidence via the influence of gruesome evidence on the emotional state of jurors. Further, although exposure to any photographs had similar effects on mock juror affect, emotional reactions to gruesome photographic evidence appeared to lead to changes in the assessment of evidence and to an increased likelihood of conviction or liability when compared with neutral and no photographs. The implications of the results for policy, practice and research are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A., History) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2010. This thesis {{offers an}} {{analysis}} of the life of Rena Marie Vale (1898 - 1983), a professional anticommunist crusader who likely shaped the agenda if not the personality of the California Un-American Activities Committee (CUAC) in the 1960 s. Topics explored herein include anticommunism through the lens of gender; the role of professional women in the anticommunist jihad; the use of science fiction to expose the mortal danger of communism to America; and the response of CUAC to those who defied the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC), the anti-war peaceniks, the proponents of the Civil Rights Crusade, and the advocates of the Free Speech Movement. A number of historians have addressed women as targets of anticommunist inquisitions, but few have ever mentioned those women who operated as the inquisitors themselves. Though generally unknown to scholars, Vale toiled behind the curtain as a Red hunter deluxe, framing the questions for the investigative committee as well as supplying the <b>inculpatory</b> <b>evidence</b> needed to indict individuals summoned to prove their Americanism. For instance, as the committee???s main conduit of information on the seismic events occurring in California in the 1960 s, she likely influenced the views of Hugh Burns and Richard Coombs by giving them the fodder to brand the Free Speech Movement a communist plot. This thesis draws primarily from the Records of the California Un-American Activities Committee housed at the California State Archives, particularly the valuable Index Card File dating from 1954 to 1968; the Bay Area Reports and the Office Files, which explain why Vale created the aforementioned cards; and Vale???s own testimony before CUAC and HUAC. Insight into Vale???s mindset can best be gleaned from her memoir and her three science fiction novels. Other primary sources that undergird my essay include interviews, newspaper reports, and correspondence. Finally, secondary accounts have also informed my analysis; specifically, I have especially relied on the works of Edward Barrett, Jr., David Caute, John Haynes, Michael Heale, Richard Hofstadter, Lisa McGirr, Kathryn Olmsted, William Rorabaugh, Catherine Rymph, Ingrid Scobie, Ellen Shrecker, and Kate Weigand. The thesis concludes that Vale not only experienced professional success as a diligent pursuer of communists, but likely her vital role as a female Torquemada conferred enormous personal satisfaction after having been spurned by chauvinistic males in the studio system and even in the Communist Party. It also recognizes the success of Vale???s futuristic fiction both as an exemplar of Cold War hysteria and for her Cassandra-like efforts to fan chimerical fears of thermonuclear war and the Soviet subjugation of the United States.

40|$|Digital Forensic {{investigations}} play a {{vital role}} in our technologically enhanced world, and it may incorporate a number of different types of evidence — ranging from digital to physical. During a Digital Forensics investigation an investigator may formulate a number of hypotheses, and in order to reason objectively about them, an investigator must take into account such evidence in its entirety, relying on multiple sources. When formulating such objective reasoning an investigator must take into account not only <b>inculpatory</b> <b>evidence</b> but also exculpatory evidence and evidence of tampering. In addition, the investigator must factor in the reliability of the evidence used, the potential for error (tool and human based) and they must factor in the certainty with which they can make various claims. By doing so and creating a detailed audit trail of all actions performed by the investigator they can be better prepared against challenges against their work when it is presented. An investigator must also take into account the dynamic aspects of an investigation, such as certain evidence no longer being admissible, and they must continuously factor these aspects into their reasoning, to ensure that their conclusions still hold. Investigations may draw over a large period of time, and should the relevant information not be captured in detail, it may be lost or forgotten, affecting the reliability of an investigator’s findings and affecting future investigators’ capability to build on and continue an investigator’s work. In this dissertation we investigate whether it is possible to provide a formalised means for capturing and encoding an investigator’s reasoning process, in a detailed and structured manner. By this we mean we would like to capture and encode an investigator’s hypotheses, their arguments, their conclusions and the certainty with which they can make such claims, as well as the various pieces of evidence (digital and physical) that they use as a foundation for their arguments. We also want to capture the steps an investigator took when formulating these arguments and the steps an investigator took in order to get evidence into its intended form. The capturing of such a detailed reasoning process helps to allow for a more thorough reconstruction of an investigator’s finding, further improving the reliability that can be placed in them. By encoding the investigator’s reasoning process, an investigator can more easily receive feedback on the impacts that the various dynamic aspects of an investigation have upon their reasoning. In order to achieve these goals, our dissertation presents a model, called the Chain of Findings, allowing investigators to formulate and capture their reasoning process throughout the investigation, using a combination of goal-driven and data-driven approaches. When formulating their reasoning, the model allows investigators to treat evidence, digital and physical, uniformly as building blocks for their arguments and capture detailed information of how and why they serve their role in an investigator’s reasoning process. In addition, the Chain of Findings offers a number of other uses and benefits including the training of investigators and Digital Forensic Readiness.
