This state was previously reported by the Mark II,l but was tentatively identified as the <b>E(1420)</b> (a state 2 with spin-parity 1 +) as the spin of the state was not known.

In this Letter, we report on a partial-wave analysis of the K+K-n' system in the process J/ $-t yK+K-r ". (1) The analysis is based on a sample of 2. 2 ~ 10 ~ produced J/JI events. The data were collected with the Crystal Ball detector at the SLAC e+e [...] storage ring facility SPEAK {{at the peak of the}} J/$(3095) -resonance. The detector consists primarily of a segmented array of NaI(TR) crystals for high resolution measurements of the energy and position of electromagnetic showers. The photon energy resolution is a/E = 2. 6 % /E ' (E in GeV) and the photon angular resolution is l- 2 degrees, depending on energy. The solid angle coverage of the main array is 93 % of 4 ~r sr and is extended to 98 % with crystals in the endcap regions. The beam pipe is surrounded by magnetostrictive spark chambers and multiwire proportional chambers for charged particle tagging and tracking. The innermost spark chamber layer covers 94 % of the solid angle. Details on the detector, event trigger, and data reduction are described in detail elsewhere. 5 Figure 1 shows the K+K-r ' invariant mass distribution for events which have two charged tracks and three y's, each with observed energy greater than 40 MeV, and which satisfy 3 -constraint fits 6 to (1) with- 3 -XL < 15.

40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. An {{analysis of the}} production, decay, and quantum numbers of the [ [...] . ](1440) in radiative [ [...] . ] decays is presented. The [ [...] . ](1440), because of its large production in this OZI-suppressed channel, is considered a possible gluonic bound-state, or glueball. Such states {{appear to be a}} natural consequence of the non-Abelian structure of the SU(3) color gauge group of QCD. The data, 2. 7 x 10 [ [...] . ] produced [ [...] . ], were obtained using the Mark III detector at the SPEAR [ [...] . ] storage ring. The spin-parity of the [ [...] . ](1440) is independently determined to be [ [...] . ] using two decay modes, [ [...] . ] and [ [...] . ]. The technique used is based on the three-body helicity formalism, which provides a means of studying the decay angular distributions in a manner independent {{of the structure of the}} Dalitz plot. This is particularly useful in the case of [ [...] . ], where the limited phase space makes it difficult to unambiguously identify the two-body modes. In addition, the measured angular distributions provide direct visual evidence supporting the spin-parity assignment. Measurements of the [ [...] . ] mass, width, and branching fractions are obtained using [ [...] . ], [ [...] . ], and [ [...] . ]. The relative branching fractions are consistent with the isospin 0 predictions. From a study of the [ [...] . ] Dalitz plot, an upper limit for [ [...] . ] is obtained. These results are discussed in the context of the current experimental status of the <b>E(1420).</b> Upper limits are presented for [ [...] . ], [ [...] . ], [ [...] . ], and [ [...] . ]. The limit on [ [...] . ] appears to be inconsistent with a large value of [ [...] . ]. However, the very uncertain status and properties of the [ [...] . ](980) make it difficult to pinpoint the source of this inconsistency. Together, these upper limits provide evidence that, apart from a possible [ [...] . ] signal, [ [...] . ] is the dominant [ [...] . ] decay and that inclusive [ [...] . ] production is dominated by [ [...] . ]. The double radiative channels [ [...] . ] Vector, where Vector = [ [...] . ] are studied to probe the quark content of the object X. Many pseudoscalar mixing models predict that the [ [...] . ] acquires a large radiative width into [ [...] . ] through mixing with the [ [...] . ] and [ [...] . ]. In the [ [...] . ] final state, a broad structure is observed in the 1. 4 GeV region. Although the measured angular distributions are consistent with the pseudoscalar predictions, the central mass of this structure is below that found for the [ [...] . ] in the [ [...] . ] channels [ [...] . ]. Thus, with the present limited statistics, it is unclear whether this structure should be identified with the [ [...] . ]. Upper limits are obtained for [ [...] . ] and [ [...] . ]. Measurements are also obtained for [ [...] . ] and [ [...] . ] using the [ [...] . ] final state. These results are compared with theoretical predictions. Measurements of the hadronic decays [ [...] . ] and [ [...] . ], as well as the observation of the isospin-violating decay [ [...] . ], are presented.
