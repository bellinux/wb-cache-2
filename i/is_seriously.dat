5|$|Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} {{is traditionally}} {{divided into three}} parts: the inner, middle and outer magnetosphere.

In the middle (between 10 and 40RJ) and outer (further than 40RJ) magnetospheres, the magnetic field is not a dipole, and <b>is</b> <b>seriously</b> disturbed by its interaction with the plasma sheet (see magnetodisk below).|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to habitat destruction, the pygmy slow loris <b>is</b> <b>seriously</b> threatened by hunting and trade.
