40|$|Aims : To {{investigate}} and compare commercial and farm-level milling operations {{in respect of}} the monitoring and control of Salmonella contamination. Methods and Results : Four commercial feedmills and four on-farm poultry <b>feed</b> <b>mixers</b> were intensively sampled. Samples included dust and spillages and were cultured for Salmonella. Serovars in ingredients on farms were associated with wildlife and/or livestock, whereas those in commercial mill ingredients were associated with domestically-produced cereals and imported vegetable protein. Endemic contamination of two commercial feedmills was reflected in isolates obtained from finished products and destination flocks. Renovation of equipment and chemical treatment of equipment and feed had not removed endemic strains, and previous routine monitoring in the commercial mills had not revealed the degree of contamination found in the present investigations. Conclusions : Ingredient contamination was diverse and reflected the sources and storage environments used by mills and farms, respectively. The use of dust and spillage samples showed a clear sensitivity advantage over the previously-used monitoring methods in the feedmills. Significance and Impact of Study : Monitoring for Salmonella contamination of commercial feedmills requires sensitive methods, such as those employed in the present study.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to review the {{vertical}} and horizontal reshuffling that took place in a specific area of the Hungarian grain product cycle, i. e. raw material production, and its effect on the demand-side power structure. The answers derived from questionnaires and in-depth interviews allowed the classification of buyers using cluster analysis, and also the modeling of their decisions during the price negotiation. The completed analysis shows us that on the grain market, price leaders are primarily among the large trading companies and holdings, which can be attributed to their size, storage capacity, logistical capabilities and strategy. Processing (mills, <b>feed</b> <b>mixers,</b> seed-sellers), integrator, retail and other companies on the grain market are price-adaptive. The intervention price level affects the price negotiations and market strategies of demand-side players significantly, which suggests that in the future, the modification of the intervention system may prove to be a main force behind vertical and horizontal changes. Structural changes can be further emphasized by the switch to the SPS system and the increased grain demand resulting from the commissioning of bioethanol-producing plants. grain sector, process chain, price leaders, cluster analyses, Agribusiness, Agricultural Finance, Crop Production/Industries, International Relations/Trade,...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{vertical}} livestock <b>feed</b> <b>mixer</b> with spring-controlled {{packaging unit}} was designed, constructed and tested. This design had in focus a weighing and gauging mechanism which made possible a semi-automatic packaging {{in conjunction with}} feed mixing and discharge operations. The main components of the machine included a double-wall cylindrical mixing chamber consisting of recycling gate, discharge gate, evacuating gate, window and a screw conveyor inside an inner cylinder. The packaging mechanism {{is attached to the}} discharge gate and the base of the frame with the frame serving as the structural support for the machine and its contents. The main design parameters included screw conveyor features such as helix angle, fill ratio, normal pressure due to bulk load on screw shaft, axial force per pitch, total screw torque, capacity and power requirements of the screw conveyor. The design concept of the packaging mechanism involved determination of free length of spring, total active length, pitch of spring, spring index, stiffness of spring, maximum shear stress and total spring rate. In a hitch-free operation, the machine was designed to package 25 kg of mixed feed ingredients at a time. In operation, the feed ingredients are scooped and moved upward by the rotary movement of the screw conveyor and then sprayed back into the smaller cylinder without passing through the internal tube. A preliminary testing was carried out on the machine to determine the actual discharge rate and hence the performance of the packaging mechanism. Results revealed that an average discharge rate of 0. 356 kg/s was obtained. Powered by a 2 hp single phase electric motor, the machine has a mixing capacity of 4. 124 m 3 /h with a production cost of $ 470. Nomenclatur...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. An {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} a commercial, dry‐grind ethanol plant to determine if selected additives would improve flowability of dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS). Main treatment effects were moisture content of DDGS (9 vs. 12 % w. b.) and anti‐caking agent (ACA). The ACA treatments were: No additive (Control); a moisture migration control agent at 2. 5 kg/metric ton (DMX‐ 7); calcium carbonate at 2 % w. b. (Calcium carbonate); or a clinoptilolite zeolite at 1. 25 % w. b. (Zeolite). The ACA were added at the desired level to about 2, 275 kg of DDGS using a vertical‐screw <b>feed</b> <b>mixer.</b> Batches of DDGS were weighed and loaded into one of eight compartments in an auger‐equipped feed truck. After loading, the truck traveled 250 km, sat motionless for at least 60 h, and traveled 250 km back to the ethanol plant. Time required to unload each compartment was recorded. There were no significant interactions between moisture level and ACA for any response criteria. Mean moisture levels were 9 % and 11. 6 % for low and high moisture treatments. Flow rate of DDGS at unloading was higher (P < 0. 01) for the 9 % compared with 12 % moisture level (620 vs. 390 kg/min). Flow rates of DDGS at unloading were: 509 (Control), 441 (DMX‐ 7), 512 (Calcium carbonate), and 558 (Zeolite) kg/min. None of the ACA created flow rates that differed significantly from Control. In conclusion, increasing moisture content from 9 % to 11. 6 % clearly decreased flowability of DDGS. The ACA used in this experiment at the selected concentrations did not improve flowability of DDGS. Keywords.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the paper is {{to show how the}} soybean meal is {{processed}} into the feed concentrate andhow the GMO content is tested when the soybean meal is accepted in the feed concentrate factory. Design/methodology/approach: After acceptance of the soybean meal the analysis for the protein and moisturecontend is made by the use of Inframatic. The average monthly sample is sent to an external laboratory for testingfor GMO content. According to the regulations the GMO content must not exceed 0, 9 % and is determined by thePCR (polymeraze chain reaction) method. The soybean meal is processed into the feed concentrate by the use ofhammer mill, <b>feed</b> <b>mixer</b> and pellet mill. Ten analyses for GMO content have been performed by establishing theinfluence of the origin on the GMO content; the average percentage of GMO in the soybean meal was 0. 3 %. Findings: In two cases the results of analyses of the soybean meal were negative, which means that the soybeanmeal did not contain any GMO; in eight cases the test was positive, but none of them exceeded the sill of 0. 9 %. Irrespective of the supplier or origin the average percentage of the GMO in soybean meal is approximatelyidentical, i. e., 0. 3 %. Only the soybean meal, arriving from Brazil, has a smaller percentage of the GMO, i. e., 0. 22 %. It means that not the supplier, but only the origin has an influence on the percentage of the GMO insoybean meal. Research limitations/implications: The research has been performed on soybean meal, arriving from Braziland Hungary, where ten analyses for GMO content have been performed. Practical implications: On the average, the soybean meal coming from Hungary contains more GMO, i. e., 0, 3 %, than the soybean meal coming from Brazil, which contains 0. 22 %.

40|$|Poultry can {{be managed}} under {{different}} feeding systems, depending on the husbandry skills and the feed available. These systems include the following: (1) a complete dry feed offered as a mash ad libitum; (2) the same feed offered as pellets or crumbles ad libitum; (3) a complete feed with added whole grain; (4) a complete wet feed given {{once or twice a}} day; (5) a complete feed offered on a restricted basis; (6) choice feeding. Of all these, an interesting alternative to offering complete diets is choice feeding which can be applied on both a small or large commercial scale. Under choice feeding or free-choice feeding birds are usually offered a choice between three types of feedstuffs: (a) an energy source (e. g. maize, rice bran, sorghum or wheat); (b) a protein source (e. g. soyabean meal, meat meal, fish meal or coconut meal) plus vitamins and minerals and (c), in the case of laying hens, calcium in granular form (i. e. oyster-shell grit). This system differs from the modern commercial practice of offering a complete diet comprising energy and protein sources, ground and mixed together. Under the complete diet system, birds are mainly only able to exercise their appetite for energy. When the environmental temperature varies, the birds either over- or under-consume protein and calcium. The basic principle behind practising choice feeding with laying hens is that individual hens are able to select from the various feed ingredients on offer and compose their own diet, according to their actual needs and production capacity. A choice-feeding system is of particular importance to small poultry producers in developing countries, such as Indonesia, because it can substantially reduce the cost of feed. The system is flexible and can be constructed {{in such a way that}} the various needs of a flock of different breeds, including village chickens, under different climates can be met. The system also offers a more effective way to use home-produced grain, such as maize, and by-products, such as rice bran, in developing countries. Because oyster-shell grit is readily available in developing countries at lower cost than limestone, the use of cheaper oyster-shell grit can further benefit small-holders in these countries. These benefits apart, simpler equipment suffices when designing and building a <b>feed</b> <b>mixer</b> on the farm, and transport costs are lower. If whole (unground) grain is used, the intake of which is accompanied by increased efficiency of feed utilisation, the costs of grinding, mixing and many of the handling procedures associated with mash and pellet preparation are eliminated. The choice feedstuffs can all be offered in the current feed distribution systems, either by mixing the ingredients first or by using a bulk bin divided into three compartments...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the large}} {{livestock}} population in Ethiopia, the sector’s contribution at the micro or macro level is well below its potential due to various reasons, notably feed shortage and diseases, compounded by inefficiencies in the livestock {{input and output}} markets. Feed marketing studies are scarce in Ethiopia. This study is aimed at assessing the feed marketing system in Ethiopia to generate a general understanding of the feed supply and demand characteristics, feed marketing, feed prices, market places, market actors, and market institutions. The types of fodder supplied in the country differ {{from place to place}} {{depending on the type of}} crops grown as conditioned by the agro-climatic conditions. Buyers and sellers have various perceptions about the quality of the fodder supplied to the market. There are competing uses of crop residues and hay in Ethiopia. Crop residues and hay are transported in a variety of ways. Most of the crop residues are retailed in the open market. Hay is mostly sold in situ. Agro-industrial by-products from flour and edible oil mills, grind mills and local brewery are sold in all of the study areas. There are about 15 <b>feed</b> <b>mixers</b> and millers in the country as observed during the study period. However, only five of them are manufacturing purely for sale; others produce for own consumption and to sell surpluses. Feed prices are rising sharply. Available price data indicated that there are significant price differences between farm gate and wholesale prices of crop residues and hay. Among the crop residues teff straw is most expensive. Among agroindustrial by-products, linseed cake is most expensive, followed by cotton seed cake. Most of the feed trading is informal. Implications to improve the feed marketing system are drawn.

40|$|ABSTRACT: EU {{policy has}} {{improved}} {{the legal framework}} conditions for energy production from renewable sources.

40|$|This semi-annual {{progress}} reports includes further findings on CO{sub 2 }-in-Water emulsions stabilized by fine particles of limestone (CaCO{sub 3 }). Specifically, here {{we report on}} the tests performed in the DOE National Energy Technology Laboratory High Pressure Water Tunnel Facility (HPWTF) using a Kenics-type static mixer for the formation of a CO{sub 2 }-H{sub 2 }O emulsion stabilized by fine particles of CaCO{sub 3 }. The tested static mixer has an ID of 0. 5 cm, length 23. 5 cm, number of baffles 27. Under pressure, a slurry of CaCO{sub 3 } particles (mean particle size 6 {micro}m) in reverse osmosis (RO) water and liquid CO{sub 2 } were co-injected into the mixer. From the mixer, the resulting emulsion flowed into the HPWTF, which was filled with RO water kept at 6. 8 MPa pressure and 4, 8 or 12 C. The emulsion plume was photographed by three video cameras through spy windows mounted {{on the wall of the}} HPWTF. The mixer produced an emulsion consisting of tiny CO{sub 2 } droplets sheathed with a layer of CaCO{sub 3 } particles dispersed in water. The sheathed droplets are called globules. The globules diameter was measured to be in the 300 - 500 {micro}m range. The globules were sinking in the HPWTF, indicating that they are heavier than the ambient water. The tests in the HPWTF confirmed that the Kenics-type static mixer is an efficient device for forming a CO{sub 2 }-H{sub 2 }O emulsion stabilized by fine particles of CaCO{sub 3 }. The static mixer may prove to be a practical device for sequestering large quantities of CO{sub 2 } in the deep ocean in the form of a CO{sub 2 }-H{sub 2 }O-CaCO{sub 3 } emulsion. The static mixer can be mounted at the end of pipelines <b>feeding</b> the <b>mixer.</b> The static mixer has no moving parts. The pressure drop across the mixer that is necessary to sustain good mixing is created by the hydrostatic pressure of liquid CO{sub 2 } and the slurry of CaCO{sub 3 } in the pipes that <b>feed</b> the <b>mixer.</b> The tests in the HPWTF demonstrated that the emulsion plume is heavier than ambient seawater, hence the plume will sink to greater depth from the release point. Preliminary modeling indicates that an emulsion plume released at 500 m depth (the minimum depth required to prevent liquid CO{sub 2 } flashing into vapor) may sink hundreds of meters before the plume comes to rest in the density stratified ocean water. Furthermore, tests in our laboratory showed that the emulsion is slightly alkaline, not acidic, because of the excess of CaCO{sub 3 } particles present in the plume. Thus, the release of the CO{sub 2 }-H{sub 2 }OCaCO{sub 3 } emulsion in the deep ocean is not likely to acidify the seawater around the release point. The possible acidification of seawater is the major environmental hazard if pure liquid CO{sub 2 } were released in the deep ocean...|$|R

Given to these circumstances {{my goal was to}} evaluate the results of remedial program of whole pigs herd in ZD Bělčice, to assess following the principles of correct zoohygiene and veterinary prevention and also to evaluate the results of reproduction and loses for a year before repopulation of stud (2012) and after the repopulation (2014). I also focused on comparing the results of yield using parameteres like number of living newborn piglets, weaned piglets, lost piglets in pre-fatteing and fattening for those two mentioned years. I focused on following hygienic loop of operation, observing cleanliness and desinfection. I also observed preparation, washing, desinfection of sows, which are removed for farrowing. Next I dealt with hygiene and desinfection during veterinary interventions and with keeping <b>feeding</b> belts and <b>mixer</b> clean. I observed monitoring of regular controls and analysing food samples and then regular monitoring of samples examined for respiratory diseases in this stated herd. I observed visits on farm, respecting restrictions of accessing the herd. At the end of my thesis are all mentioned requirements evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Successful {{aquaculture}} highly {{depends on}} ensuring the quality feed which mostly {{depends on the}} proper feedstuffs selection and the manufacturing process. This study was undertaken to monitor the deviation of protein level and the mechanical effects on different biofactors viz. protein, moisture, ash, crude lipid and fiber in feed during manufacture. Samples were collected at randomly and batch wise from the prominent feed industry during the production period. Samples were collected from two different production level viz. ‘Final Mixer’ and ‘Finished Feed’ and third other sample was prepared as ‘Control Mixer’ on the dry basis. All the samples were analyzed by using proper analytical procedure in the laboratory of fish nutrition. The percentage of protein content was 17. 9 in control mixer and 18. 46 in final mixer which finally decreased to 17. 03 % in finished <b>feed.</b> In control <b>mixer</b> ash content was 25. 74 and 23. 1 % in final mixer which increased in finished feed to 24. 68 %. Lipid content increased in finished feed (6. 1 %) rather than the final mixer (5. 95 %) and the control mixer (3. 75 %). However, crude fiber content decreased from control <b>mixer</b> to finished <b>feed</b> thoroughly. Crude fiber content in control mixer was 7. 4 % which decreased to 6. 86 and 6. 56 % in final <b>mixer</b> and finished <b>feed</b> respectively. Again a relation may be drawn between the moisture content and ash and lipid content with crude fiber. By this study it was observed quality of feed is highly influenced by quality machine...|$|R
40|$|A {{soft metal}} with low wear {{resistance}} (6000 series aluminum), {{was used to}} minimize run time while maximizing wear rate. Two paddle configurations were tested, with the first four paddles after the augers replaced by the wear paddles. The first configuration was all flat paddles, with the first paddle not aligned with the augers and is consistent with present SPF mixer. The second configuration had helical paddles {{for the first three}} stages after the augers and a flat paddle at the fourth stage. The first helical paddle was aligned with the auger flight for the second configuration. The all flat paddle configuration wear rate was approximately double the wear rate of the helical paddles for the first two sets of paddles after the augers. For both configurations, there was little or no wear on the third and fourth paddle sets based on mass change, indicating that the fully wetted premix materials are much less abrasive than the un-wetted or partially wetted premix. Additionally, inspection of the wear surface of the paddles at higher magnification showed the flat paddles were worn much more than the helical and is consistent with the wear rates. Aligning the auger discharge flight with the first set of helical paddles was effective in reducing the wear rate as compared to the flat paddle configuration. Changing the paddle configuration from flat to helical resulted in a slight increase in rheological properties. Although, both tests produced grout-like material that is within the processing rage of the SPF, {{it should be noted that}} cement is not included in the premix and water was used rather than salt solution, which does affect the rheology of the fresh grout. The higher rheological properties from the helical wear test are most likely due to the reduced number of shearing paddles in the mixer. In addition, there is variation in the rheological data for each wear test. This is most likely due to the way that the dry <b>feeds</b> enter the <b>mixer</b> from the dry feeder. The premix is discharged from the hopper in an unsteady fashion, where irregular sized clumps were observed leaving the discharge of the auger, though the auger speed is constant...|$|R
