25|$|Solar thermal {{collectors}} {{are classified}} by the United States Energy Information Administration as low-, medium-, or high-temperature collectors. Low-temperature collectors are generally unglazed {{and used to}} heat swimming pools or to heat ventilation air. Medium-temperature collectors are also usually flat plates but are used for <b>heating</b> <b>water</b> or air for residential and commercial use. High-temperature collectors concentrate sunlight using mirrors or lenses and are generally used for fulfilling heat requirements up to 300 deg C / 20 bar pressure in industries, and for electric power production. Two categories include Concentrated Solar Thermal (CST) for fulfilling heat requirements in industries, and Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) when the heat collected is used for power generation. CST and CSP are not replaceable in terms of application. The largest facilities {{are located in the}} American Mojave Desert of California and Nevada. These plants employ a variety of different technologies. The largest examples include, Ivanpah Solar Power Facility (377MW), Solar Energy Generating Systems installation (354MW), and Crescent Dunes (110MW). Spain is the other major developer of solar thermal power plant. The largest examples include, Solnova Solar Power Station (150MW), the Andasol solar power station (150MW), and Extresol Solar Power Station (100MW).|$|E

[...] By 1967 around one in twenty households heated its water with the sun and 50,000 solar heaters had been sold. [...] However, cheap oil from Iran and from oil fields captured in the Six-Day War made Israeli electricity cheaper and the demand for solar heaters [...] dropped. [...] After the energy crisis in the 1970s, in 1980 the Israeli Knesset passed a law requiring the installation of solar water heaters in all new homes (except high towers with insufficient roof area). As a result, Israel is now the world leader in the use of solar energy per capita (3% of the primary national energy consumption).|$|E
2500|$|In a {{programme}} {{transmitted by}} the British Broadcasting Corporation BBC Horizon broadcast on 12 October 2000, two geologists (Day and McGuire) cited this crack {{as proof that}} half of the Cumbre Vieja had moved towards the Atlantic Ocean (Day et al.; 1999, and Ward and Day, 2001). They postulate that this process was driven by the pressure caused by the rising magma <b>heating</b> <b>water</b> trapped within the structure of the island. They hypothesised that during a future eruption, the western flank of the Cumbre Vieja, with a mass of approximately 1.5 x1015 kg, could slide into the ocean. This could then potentially generate a giant wave which they termed a [...] "megatsunami" [...] around - high in the region of the islands. The wave would radiate out across the Atlantic and inundate much of the eastern seaboard of North America about 7 hours later, many of the islands in the Caribbean and northern coasts of South America between six and eight hours later. They estimate that the tsunami will have waves possibly [...] or higher causing massive devastation along the coastlines. Modelling suggests that the tsunami could inundate up to [...] inland – depending upon topography. The basis for Ward and Day (2001) modelling the collapse of a much larger portion of the western flank than that that the currently visible surface crack indicates as being potentially unstable, was based on geological mapping by Day et al.; (1999). In this paper they argue that {{a large part of the}} western flank has been constructed in the scar of a previous collapse and therefore sits upon unstable debris.|$|E
2500|$|Metal stoves {{came into}} {{use in the}} 18th century. An early and famous example of a metal stove is the Franklin stove, {{said to have been}} invented by Benjamin Franklin in 1742. It had a labyrinthine path for hot exhaust gases to escape, thus {{allowing}} heat to enter the room instead of going up the chimney. The Franklin stove, however, was designed for heating, not for cooking. Benjamin Thompson at the turn to the 19th century {{was among the first to}} present a working metal kitchen stove. His Rumford fireplace used one fire to heat several pots that were also hung into holes so that they could be heated from the sides, too. It was even possible to regulate the heat individually for each hole. His stove was designed for large canteen or castle kitchens, though. It would take another 30 years until the technology had been refined and the size of the iron stove been reduced enough for domestic use. Philo Stewart's Oberlin stove was a much more compact, wood-burning cast-iron [...] stove, patented in the U.S. in 1834. It became a huge commercial success with some 90,000 units sold in the next 30 years. In Europe, similar designs also appeared in the 1830s. In the following years, these iron stoves evolved into specialised cooking appliances with flue pipes connected to the chimney, oven holes, and installations for <b>heating</b> <b>water.</b> The originally open holes into which the pots were hung were now covered with concentric iron rings on which the pots were placed. Depending on the size of the pot or the heat needed, one could remove the inner rings.|$|E
