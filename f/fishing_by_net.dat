2500|$|By the 16th century BC the {{extensive}} employment of omen-based astrology can be evidenced in the compilation {{of a comprehensive}} reference work known as Enuma Anu Enlil. Its contents consisted of 70 cuneiform tablets comprising 7,000 celestial omens. Texts from this time also refer to an oral tradition - the origin and content of {{which can only be}} speculated upon. At this time Babylonian astrology was solely mundane, concerned with the prediction of weather and political matters, and prior to the 7th century BC the practitioners' understanding of astronomy was fairly rudimentary. [...] Astrological symbols likely represented seasonal tasks, and were used as a yearly almanac of listed activities to remind a community to do things appropriate to the season or weather (such as symbols representing times for harvesting, gathering shell-fish, <b>fishing</b> <b>by</b> <b>net</b> or line, sowing crops, collecting or managing water reserves, hunting, and seasonal tasks critical in ensuring the survival of children and young animals for the larger group). By the 4th century, [...] their mathematical methods had progressed enough to calculate future planetary positions with reasonable accuracy, at which point extensive ephemerides began to appear.|$|E

They made their livelihoods catching <b>fish</b> <b>by</b> <b>net</b> for sale in Goshen and cleared some 20 acre of land. Trees were floated through the main channel to a saw mill on Turkey Creek or one just south of Vawter Park. The poplar trees going to homes in Syracuse and oak made into barrel staves and firewood. The Oram brothers planted the area with Concord and Delaware grapes. During the Civil War, Thomas Oram joined the Union army and later moved to Kansas. Kale later married a woman named [...] "Mam" [...] who lived with her son Bill in a lowly cabin on Syracuse Lake.

40|$|Trammel nets are {{commonly}} used to sample rare fishes; however, little research has assessed delayed mortality associated with this capture technique. We conducted laboratory experiments to evaluate the effects of capture <b>by</b> trammel <b>net</b> on bonytail Gila elegans, razorback sucker Xyrauchen texanus, and roundtail chub Gila robusta, at 15, 20, and 25 uC. Fish (139 – 288 mm total length) were entangled in a trammel net for 2 h or captured <b>by</b> seine <b>net</b> and then monitored for mortality for at least 14 d. Blood samples were collected immediately after capture, and plasma cortisol levels were quantified as an index of capture-related stress. The cortisol response varied by species, but mean cortisol levels were higher for <b>fish</b> captured <b>by</b> trammel <b>netting</b> (295. 9 ng/mL) relative to <b>fish</b> captured <b>by</b> seine <b>netting</b> (215. 8 ng/mL). Only one fish (of 550) died during capture and handling, but 42 % of the trammel-netted fish and 11 % of the seine-netted fish died within 14 d after capture. In general, mortality after capture <b>by</b> trammel <b>net</b> increased with increased water temperature and at 25 uC was 88 % for bonytail, 94 % for razorback sucker, and 25 % for roundtail chub. Delayed mortality of wild-caught <b>fish</b> captured <b>by</b> trammel <b>net</b> {{has the potential to}} be high, at least under some circumstances.

25|$|The {{combined}} nets {{are maintained}} {{more or less}} vertically in the usual way by floats on the floatline and weights on the groundline. They are set on the bottom. After a time depending on the target species, they are hauled on board. Traditional combined <b>nets</b> were hauled <b>by</b> hand, especially on smaller boats. Recent hydraulic driven net haulers are now common. The gilled, entangled and enmeshed fish are removed from the <b>net</b> <b>by</b> hand.

5000|$|Fishing {{boats are}} {{generally}} small, often {{little more than}} 30 m but up to 100 m for a large tuna or whaling ship. Aboard a fish processing vessel, the catch can be made ready for market and sold more quickly once the ship makes port. Special purpose vessels have special gear. For example, trawlers have winches and arms, stern-trawlers have a rear ramp, and tuna seiners have skiffs. In 2004, 85800000 t of fish {{were caught in the}} marine capture fishery. Anchoveta represented the largest single catch at 10700000 t. [...] That year, the top ten marine capture species also included Alaska pollock, Blue whiting, Skipjack tuna, Atlantic herring, Chub mackerel, Japanese anchovy, Chilean jack mackerel, Largehead hairtail, and Yellowfin tuna. [...] Other species including salmon, shrimp, lobster, clams, squid and crab, are also commercially fished. Modern commercial fishermen use many methods. One is <b>fishing</b> <b>by</b> <b>nets,</b> such as purse seine, beach seine, lift nets, gillnets, or entangling nets. Another is trawling, including bottom trawl. Hooks and lines are used in methods like long-line fishing and hand-line fishing. Another method is the use of fishing trap.|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} a preliminary {{assessment of the}} state of salmon stocks and fisheries in England and Wales in 2001 to assist ICES in providing scientific advice to NASCO and to provide early feedback to fishery managers and anglers. The chief indicators of the state o f salmon stocks are normally the catches taken <b>by</b> rod and <b>net</b> fisheries. However, in 2001 angling was affected by the outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD), which restricted angling opportunities and access to rod fisheries {{in many parts of the}} country for lengthy periods. It is impossible to quantify the impact that FMD had on rod catches, although these were undoubtedly significantly reduced; net fisheries were unaffected by FMD. The declared salmon catch for 2001 (including those <b>fish</b> released alive <b>by</b> anglers) is provisionally estimated at 209 tonnes, representing some 57, 000 fish, and comprising 153 tonnes (- 43, 000 <b>fish)</b> <b>by</b> <b>nets</b> and fixed engines and 56 tonnes (- 14, 000 <b>fish)</b> <b>by</b> rods. For direct comparison with previous years, it should be noted that the declared catch prior to the issue of a second reminder was about 49 tonnes (see below). An estimated 26 tonnes (43 %) of the rod catch was released alive. These figures do not take account of catches of salmon which go unreported (including those taken illegally), and it is estimated that there may have been a total of 33 tonnes of additional fish caught in 2001; approximately 15 % of all fish killed...|$|R
