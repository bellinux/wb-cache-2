5|$|They {{arrive at}} a cave. Tintin ventures inside and finds Chang, who is feverish and shaking. The Yeti {{suddenly}} appears, revealed as a large anthropoid, reacting with anger at Tintin's attempt to take Chang. As it lunges at Tintin, the <b>flash</b> <b>bulb</b> of Tintin's camera goes off, and scares the Yeti away. Chang tells Tintin that the Yeti saved his life after the crash. Upon returning to inhabited lands, the friends are surprised to be met by the Grand Abbot, who presents Tintin with a khata in honour of the bravery he has shown for his friend Chang. As the party travels home, Chang muses that the Yeti is not a wild animal, but has a human soul. The Yeti sadly watches their departure from a distance.|$|E
25|$|Attached to the {{cylindrical}} ballistic {{case was}} a natural-uranium liner, the radiation case. The SHRIMP design used an approximately 2.5cm thick uranium radiation case. Its internal surface was lined with ~240 μm thick copper liner made from 0.08 μm thick copper foil, due to copper possessing excellent reflecting properties, increasing the overall albedo of the hohlraum. Hohlraum albedo {{is a very important}} design parameter for any inertial-confinement configuration. A relatively high albedo permits higher interstage coupling due to the more favorable azimuthal and latitudinal angles of reflected radiation. The limiting value of the albedo for high-Z materials is reached when the thickness is 5–10 g/cm, or 0.5–1.0 free paths. Thus, a hohlraum made of uranium much thicker than a free path of uranium would be disadvantageous in terms of bomb weight and use of raw materials. At the same time the angular anisotropy increases as the atomic number of the scatterer material is reduced. Thus the use of copper, or in other devices of gold or aluminium, as hohlraum liners is imperative as the greater the value of Z of the scatterer the greater this absorption probability will be. There are 2 sources of X-rays in the hohlraum; primary's irradiance which is dominant at the beginning and during the pulse rise and the wall which is important during the required radiation temperature's (T) plateau. The primary emits radiation {{in a manner similar to}} a <b>flash</b> <b>bulb,</b> and the secondary needs constant T to properly implode. This constant wall temperature is dictated by the ablation pressure requirements to drive compression which lay on average at about 0.4 keV (out of a range of 0.2 to 2 keV) corresponding to several thousand kelvins. Wall temperature depended on the temperature of the primary's core which peaked at about 5.4 keV during boosted-fission. The final wall-temperature, which corresponds to energy of the wall-reradiated X-rays to the secondary's pusher, also drops due to losses from the hohlraum material itself. Natural uranium nails, lined to the top of their head with copper, attached the radiation case to the ballistic case. The nails were bolted in vertical arrays in a double-shear configuration to better distribute the shear loads. This method of attaching the radiation case to the ballistic case was first used successfully in the Ivy Mike device. The radiation case had a parabolic end, which housed the COBRA primary that was employed to create the conditions needed to start the fusion reaction, and its other end was a cylinder, as also seen in Bravo's declassified film.|$|E
2500|$|The editing of Raging Bull {{began when}} {{production}} was temporarily {{put on hold}} and was completed in 1980. Scorsese worked with the editor, Thelma Schoonmaker, to achieve a final cut of the film. Their main decision was to abandon Schrader's idea of LaMotta's nightclub act interweaving with the flashback of his youth and instead they just followed {{along the lines of}} a single flashback where only scenes of LaMotta practicing his stand-up would be left bookending the film. A sound mix arranged by Frank Warner was a delicate process taking six months. According to Scorsese, the sound on Raging Bull was difficult because each punch, camera shot, and <b>flash</b> <b>bulb</b> would be different. Also, there was the issue of trying to balance the quality between scenes featuring dialogue and those involving boxing (which were done in Dolby Stereo). Raging Bull went through a test screening in front of a small audience including the chief executives of United Artists, Steven Bach and Andy Albeck. The screening was shown at the MGM screening room in New York around July 1980. Later, Albeck praised Scorsese by calling him a [...] "true artist".|$|E

50|$|Cameras {{designed}} for use with <b>flash</b> <b>bulbs</b> generally had {{one or more of}} S (slow) sync, M (medium) sync, F (fast) sync, or FP/FPX (flat peak) sync, {{designed for}} use with corresponding bulb types. These sync modes close the contacts a few milliseconds before the shutter is open, to give the flashbulb time to reach peak brightness before exposing the film. Class M bulbs reach their peak illumination at around 20-25 milliseconds after ignition, and class F lamps reach their peak at approximately 5 milliseconds. Most standard <b>flash</b> <b>bulbs</b> used M sync. X sync closes the flash contact just as the shutter blades are almost completely open, and M sync closes the flash contact 20 milliseconds before the blades are completely open.|$|R

5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, color photography became available, but was still unreliable and expensive, so most wedding photography was still practiced in black and white. The concept of capturing the wedding [...] "event" [...] came about after the Second World War. Using film roll technology and improved lighting techniques available with the invention of the compact <b>flash</b> <b>bulb,</b> photographers would often show up at a wedding and try to sell the photos later. Despite the initial low quality photographs that often resulted, the competition forced the studio photographers to start working on location.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "Golden Age of Photojournalism" [...] {{is often}} {{considered}} to be roughly the 1930s through the 1950s.

50|$|The {{vividness}} of {{the memory}} can increase one's belief in the veracity {{of the memory}} but not as strongly as spatial context. Some memories are extremely vivid. For the person recalling vivid memories of personal significance, these memories {{appear to be more}} accurate than everyday memories. These memories have been termed flashbulb memories. However, flashbulb memories may not be any more accurate than everyday memories when evaluated objectively. In one study, both <b>flash</b> <b>bulb</b> memories of 9/11 and everyday memories deteriorated over time; however, reported vividness, recollection and belief in accuracy of flashbulb memories remained high.|$|E
50|$|In 1970 {{they began}} to {{manufacture}} the Everflash series of cameras in Clifton that accepted Kodak's new 126 cartridge film, and several years later Everflash cameras that handled the then new Kodak 110 cartridge film. Keystone's claim to fame was their built in electronic flash {{rather than having to}} use a <b>flash</b> <b>bulb</b> or flash cube, which was popular then on many other cameras. Poor internal management structure led to many quality problems in the early 1970s and serious losses. Keystone later added its instant picture Everflash camera using Polaroid film again stressing the Everflash feature rather than Polaroid's use of the Flash Bar.|$|E
50|$|Chapline {{began to}} discuss the concept with fellow O-Group member Lowell Wood, Teller's protege. The two collaborated on a major review of the x-ray laser field in 1975. They {{suggested}} such a device would be a powerful tool in materials science, for making holograms of viruses where conventional laser's longer wavelengths did not provide the required optical resolution, and {{as a sort of}} <b>flash</b> <b>bulb</b> for taking images of the nuclear fusion process in their inertial confinement fusion devices. This review contained the calculations that demonstrated both the rapid reaction times needed in such a device and the extremely high energies required for pumping. The review did not mention their concept of nuclear pumping.|$|E

5000|$|Pack film {{cameras were}} mostly {{equipped}} with automatic exposure, but {{still had to}} be focused and a <b>flash</b> <b>bulb</b> or cube unit needed {{to be used with}} colour film indoors. The development of the film required the photographer pull two tabs, the second tab which pulled the positive/negative [...] "sandwich" [...] from the camera, where it developed outside the camera. If the temperature was below 15°C (60°F), the positive/negative [...] "sandwich" [...] was placed between two aluminum plates and placed either in the user's pocket or under their arm to keep it warm while developing. After the required development time (15 seconds to 2 minutes), the positive (with the latent image) was peeled apart from the negative.|$|E

50|$|Hans Hass, the {{underwater}} diving pioneer, approached Franke & Heidecke {{to see if}} they could make him a special housing suitable for underwater photography. As a result, Rollei developed the Rolleimarin, an ingenious underwater camera housing rated for depths up to 100 m. It was made from two cast metal parts. The top part contained a glass prism that was attached to the camera's focusing screen. There were also knobs on top of the housing for adjusting the exposure and aperture settings. On the bottom, left-hand side of the housing was the focusing knob, and on the right-hand side, the winding handle and a frame counter. There was also a filter turret. A special <b>flash</b> <b>bulb</b> could be attached for flash photography, in which case a battery pack had to be installed inside the housing. Of course, a viewfinder frame could also be screwed onto the housing.|$|E
50|$|The raw {{screen was}} first coated overall with a stencil material. This was then {{sandwiched}} with the artwork and the Gocco's simple battery-powered lightbox {{was used to}} expose the screen. This used <b>flash</b> <b>bulbs</b> {{similar to those found}} in old cameras. The exposed screen could then be developed to wash away the unexposed areas (i.e. those shielded by the artwork), producing a stencil screen.|$|R
50|$|Gehr's {{photographic}} {{style was}} renowned for {{his use of}} artificial light.

50|$|The {{observation}} {{light is}} focused via {{a series of}} lenses through a doughnut shaped aperture, which then passes through a central aperture to form an annulus, before passing through the camera objective lens and through the cornea onto the retina. The light reflected from the retina passes through the un-illuminated hole in the doughnut formed by the illumination system. As the light paths of the two systems are independent, there are minimal reflections of the light source captured in the formed image. The image forming rays continue towards the low powered telescopic eyepiece. When the button is pressed to take a picture, a mirror interrupts {{the path of the}} illumination system allow the light from the <b>flash</b> <b>bulb</b> to pass into the eye. Simultaneously, a mirror falls in front of the observation telescope, which redirects the light onto the capturing medium, whether it is film or a digital CCD. Because of the eye’s tendency to accommodate while looking though a telescope, it is imperative that the exiting vergence is parallel in order for an in focus image to be formed on the capturing medium.|$|E

50|$|The {{expense of}} color film as {{compared}} to black-and-white {{and the difficulty of}} using it with indoor lighting combined to delay its widespread adoption by amateurs. In 1950, black-and-white snapshots were still the norm. By 1960, color was much more common but still tended to be reserved for travel photos and special occasions. Color film and color prints still cost several times as much as black-and-white, and taking color snapshots in deep shade or indoors required the use of <b>flash</b> <b>bulbs,</b> an inconvenience and an additional expense. By 1970, prices were coming down, film sensitivity had been improved, electronic flash units were replacing <b>flash</b> <b>bulbs,</b> and in most families color had become the norm for snapshot-taking. Black-and-white film continued to be used by some photographers who preferred it for aesthetic reasons or who wanted to take pictures by existing light in low-light conditions, which was still difficult to do with color film. They usually did their own developing and printing. By 1980, black-and-white film in the formats used by typical snapshot cameras, as well as commercial developing and printing service for it, had nearly disappeared.|$|R
