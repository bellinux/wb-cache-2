5|$|A second {{effect is}} that a diver {{ascending}} to altitude, will be <b>decompressing</b> en route, and will have residual nitrogen until all tissues have equilibrated to the local pressures. This means that the diver should consider any dive done before equilibration as a repetitive dive, {{even if it is}} the first dive in several days.|$|E
5|$|Therapeutic {{decompression}} is {{a procedure}} for treating decompression sickness by recompressing the diver, thus reducing bubble size, {{and allowing the}} gas bubbles to re-dissolve, then <b>decompressing</b> slowly enough to avoid further formation or growth of bubbles, or eliminating the inert gases by breathing oxygen under pressure.|$|E
5|$|The shuttle {{returns to}} Enterprise, {{which has been}} taken over by the Gorn. Kirk and Spock space dive to {{engineering}} and beam McCoy and Sulu back on board. They help Scotty (voiced by Simon Pegg) and Keenser reactivate the warp core, and restore power to sickbay so McCoy can replicate more of the antidote for airborne dispersal. The duo head to the bridge where the Henchman is holding Uhura (voiced by Zoe Saldana) hostage, demanding Kirk give them control of the ship. Kirk responds by directing their shuttle to crash into the view-screen, <b>decompressing</b> the Gorn into space. With only an hour before the Rip closes, Kirk and Spock space dive to the Gorn Commander's ship, where they disable the targeting platform to give Enterprise a fighting chance, and enter the core where T'Mar and the device are being held. Kirk and Spock destroy the device, defeat the Commander, and are beamed back to Enterprise with T'Mar. Enterprise warps back to the Milky Way Galaxy before the Rip closes; in their closing logs, Kirk and Spock state T'Mar has recovered enough to continue working on New Vulcan, and that they have been ordered to Nibiru.|$|E

25|$|The diver {{needs to}} stay on the bottom to work some of the time, and may need to have neutral {{buoyancy}} some of the time. The diving suit is usually buoyant, so added weight is usually necessary. This can be provided in several ways. Unwanted positive buoyancy is dangerous to a diver who may need to spend significant time <b>decompressing</b> during the ascent, so the weights are usually attached securely to prevent accidental loss.|$|E
25|$|Ambient air, of course, was the {{original}} machining coolant. Compressed air, supplied through pipes and hoses from an air compressor and discharged from a nozzle aimed at the tool, is sometimes a useful coolant. The force of the <b>decompressing</b> air stream blows chips away, and the decompression itself has a slight degree of cooling action. The net {{result is that the}} heat of the machining cut is carried away a bit better than by ambient air alone. Sometimes liquids are added to the air stream to form a mist (mist coolant systems, described above).|$|E

50|$|Compression {{is useful}} because it reduces {{resources}} required to store and transmit data. Computational resources are {{consumed in the}} compression process and, usually, in the reversal of the process (decompression). Data compression is subject to a space-time complexity trade-off. For instance, a compression scheme for video may require expensive hardware for the video to be <b>decompressed</b> fast enough {{to be viewed as}} it is being <b>decompressed,</b> and the option to <b>decompress</b> the video in full before watching it may be inconvenient or require additional storage. The design of data compression schemes involves trade-offs among various factors, including the degree of compression, the amount of distortion introduced (when using lossy data compression), and the computational resources required to compress and <b>decompress</b> the data.|$|R

25|$|Saturation diving lets divers {{live and}} work at depth for days or weeks at a time. After working in the water, divers are {{transferred}} in a closed diving bell to rest and live in a dry pressurized underwater habitat on the bottom or a saturation life support system of pressure chambers at the surface. Decompression {{at the end of}} the dive may take many days, but since it is done only once for a long period of exposure, rather than after each of many shorter exposures, the overall risk of decompression injury to the diver and the total time spent <b>decompressing</b> are reduced. This type of diving allows greater economy of work and enhanced safety, but the capital and running costs are high and the systems are expensive to transport. Mobility of the diver is restricted because of the umbilical.|$|E
500|$|Saturation diving lets {{professional}} divers {{live and}} work under pressure for days or weeks at a time.

40|$|In {{mountain}} area, {{the bedrock}} of the valley side is affected by a thickness of <b>decompressed</b> rock in subsurface (<b>decompressed</b> zone). Groundwater flowing in this zone disrupts the depth geothermal gradients. The evolution of thermal gradients under the <b>decompressed</b> zone depends of groundwater temperature changes into the decom- pressed zone. In this study, the phenomenon is studied from data acquired in exploration drilling prior to the con- struction of the France - Italy transalpine tunnel (High Speed Line project between Lyon and Turin). The study area {{is located in the}} Vanoise siliceous series between Modane and Avrieux (Western Alps, France). Of 31 boreholes, we selected 14 wells showing a natural thermal disturbance (not due to the drilling) linked to the groundwater flow in <b>decompressed</b> zone. The drill holes have a length between 200 and 1380 m and well logs were carried out (gamma log, acoustic log, temperature log, flowmeter log). The rocks are constituted mainly by quartzite with high thermal conductivity or by schist and gneiss with low thermal conductivity. The <b>decompressed</b> zone concerns the quartzite with thicknesses ranging from 50 m to 750 m where groundwater flow imposes a constant temperature throughout the rock thickness. In the very low permeability rocks under the <b>decompressed</b> zone, the thermal gradient shows variations with depth. These variations suggest a water temperature change in the <b>decompressed</b> zone probably due to a paleoclimate event. We used the derived of the equation describing the propagation of a temperature in a 1 D semi-infinite, in response to a sudden temperature disturbance at the boundary of the medium, to estimate the age and the amplitude of temperature change in the <b>decompressed</b> zone. The medium under the <b>decompressed</b> zone is supposed to be initially in a steady state and only conductive. Numerical tests assess that the 1 D model is applicable in the slope context. The results obtained from 13 wells data show a few warming degrees (1 to 4 K) of the <b>decompressed</b> zone occurring about two to four centuries BP. The latest high altitude drilling shows about two degrees cooling of the <b>decompressed</b> zone two centuries ago. The groundwater temperature warming can be due to a type of recharge change with a reduction of the snowmelt contribution or it can be provided by an increase of at- mospheric and rainfall temperature. The observed cooling in the latest drilling can be interpreted as a groundwater flow change caused by the permafrost melting. The temperature change occurs during the end of Little Ice Ag...|$|R

2500|$|One {{of these}} {{problems}} is that inert components of the breathing gas are dissolved in the blood and transported to the other tissues at higher concentrations under pressure, and when the pressure is reduced, if the concentration is high enough, this gas may form bubbles in the tissues, including the venous blood, which may cause the injury known as decompression sickness, or [...] "the bends". This problem may be managed by <b>decompressing</b> slowly enough to allow the gas to be eliminated while still dissolved, and eliminating those bubbles which do form while they are still small and few enough not to produce symptoms.|$|E

The far end of the line is usually marked with a brightly coloured buoy to show divers where it is and to help other boats avoid crossing the line. If there is any significant risk of a diver drifting away from the site, the dive boat should either be ready to slip the moorings at short notice, or have a tender in the water. Some skippers will tether the tender behind the dive boat where it can also be used as a drift line. A lazy shot or decompression trapeze may be suspended from the boat near the boarding area, and the drift line may be set up between this and the anchor line to guide <b>decompressing</b> divers ascending on the anchor line to the more convenient facility at the stern for the shallow stops.|$|E
