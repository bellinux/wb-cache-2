5|$|The road {{has long}} {{served as a}} de facto {{cultural}} <b>dividing</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> the predominantly poor black city and its wealthier, predominantly white northern suburbs. The perception of 8Mile as the chief <b>dividing</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> racial groups and classes persists, {{in part because the}} suburban counties of Oakland and Macomb remain, on the whole, significantly whiter and more prosperous than the city of Detroit. However, in recent years increasing numbers of whites have moved into Detroit, especially around the downtown area, and other neighborhoods in the region have become more ethnically diverse as well.|$|E
5|$|Different {{crystalline}} {{forms of}} an element are called allotropes. Some allotropes, {{particularly those of}} elements located (in periodic table terms) alongside or near the notional <b>dividing</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> metals and nonmetals, exhibit more pronounced metallic, metalloidal or nonmetallic behaviour than others. The existence of such allotropes can complicate the classification of the elements involved.|$|E

5|$|Metalloids lie {{on either}} side of the <b>dividing</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> metals and nonmetals. This can be found, in varying configurations, on some {{periodic}} tables. Elements to the lower left of the line generally display increasing metallic behaviour; elements to the upper right display increasing nonmetallic behaviour. When presented as a regular stairstep, elements with the highest critical temperature for their groups (Li, Be, Al, Ge, Sb, Po) lie just below the line.|$|E
5|$|Prior to independence, {{there had}} only been a few {{scattered}} Dutch farmers settled on the Hudson above Albany. In 1787, a group of New Englanders headed west and persuaded one Jacob Vanderhyden to sell them a large tract which they then subdivided and named Troy. The <b>dividing</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> two of the family's farms was called Grand Division Street, later shortened to Grand Street.|$|E

5|$|The six {{commonly}} recognised metalloids are boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium. Five {{elements are}} less frequently so classified: carbon, aluminium, selenium, polonium, and astatine.

5|$|The {{era that}} began when Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon in 49 BC, and ended when Octavian {{returned}} to Rome after the Battle of Actium in 29 BC, {{can be divided}} into two distinct units. The <b>dividing</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> these two units is the assassination of Caesar in March 44 BC, although from a constitutional standpoint, there was no clear <b>dividing</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> these two periods. The forces which had supported Pompey during {{the early part of the}} first period were allied against Mark Antony and Octavian in 43 BC and 42 BC, and the constitutional means through which Caesar had held power before his assassination were used by Antony and Octavian to hold power after Caesar's assassination. From a constitutional standpoint, it makes no difference whether an autocrat holds the title of Roman Dictator, as Caesar had done, or of Triumvir, as Antony and Octavian had done. From a constitutional perspective, these twenty years formed a single unit, through which the constitutional evolution of the prior century accelerated at a rapid pace. By 27 BC, Rome had completed its transition from being a city-state with a network of dependencies, to being the capital of a world empire.|$|E
5|$|There are {{types of}} planets {{that do not}} exist in the Solar System: super-Earths and mini-Neptunes, which could be rocky like Earth or a mixture of {{volatiles}} and gas like Neptune—a radius of 1.75 times that of Earth is a possible <b>dividing</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> the two types of planet. There are hot Jupiters that orbit very close to their star and may evaporate to become chthonian planets, which are the leftover cores. Another possible type of planet is carbon planets, which form in systems with a higher proportion of carbon than in the Solar System.|$|E

50|$|The United States Supreme Court under Chief Justice John Marshall {{played an}} {{important}} role in defining the power of the federal and state governments during the early 19th century. As the U.S. Constitution does not specifically define many <b>dividing</b> <b>lines</b> <b>between</b> the layers of government, the Supreme Court settled the issue in New York. The question was answered particularly in the cases, McCulloch v. Maryland and Gibbons v. Ogden, which broadly expanded the power of the national government.|$|R
5|$|Although Nash was {{responsible}} for the street's general development, some individual buildings were designed by Charles Robert Cockerell and Sir John Soane, amongst others. By 1819, the Crown were receiving regular rent and the street was becoming established. At first, it was called New Street and became a <b>dividing</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> Soho, which had declined socially and economically, and the fashionable squares and streets of Mayfair to the west. Carlton House did not last long following completion of the works and was demolished in 1829, to be replaced by Carlton House Terrace, also designed by Nash.|$|E
5|$|In 1845, the Senate {{took up the}} {{question}} of ending the joint occupancy of the Oregon Territory with Great Britain. Lewis Cass, a senator from Michigan, supported an immediate termination of the joint occupation agreement and maintained that a war with the British over the matter was inevitable. Crittenden disagreed, and insisted that Britain be given two years notice before the joint occupation of the territory was ended {{in order to allow}} time for a diplomatic resolution. Ultimately, Crittenden's position prevailed, and a compromise with Britain was effected, setting the <b>dividing</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> the two nations' claims at the 49th parallel north.|$|E
5|$|The {{lower the}} values of {{ionization}} energy, electronegativity and electron affinity, the more metallic character the element has. Conversely, nonmetallic character increases with higher values of these properties. Given the periodic trends of these three properties, metallic character tends to decrease going across a period (or row) and, with some irregularities (mostly) due to poor screening of the nucleus by d and f electrons, and relativistic effects, tends to increase going down a group (or column or family). Thus, the most metallic elements (such as caesium and francium) are found at the bottom left of traditional periodic tables and the most nonmetallic elements (oxygen, fluorine, chlorine) at the top right. The combination of horizontal and vertical trends in metallic character explains the stair-shaped <b>dividing</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> metals and nonmetals found on some periodic tables, {{and the practice of}} sometimes categorizing several elements adjacent to that line, or elements adjacent to those elements, as metalloids.|$|E
40|$|In their {{response}} to Héritier 's chapter, Dirk De Bièvre and Peter Bursens explore the <b>dividing</b> <b>lines</b> <b>between</b> the different patterns of covert integration she distinguishes and provide some reflections about combinations of these different patterns. They do so by illustrating the great usefulness and wide applicability of these seemingly simple analytical distinctions and by applying them to some other examples from European decision-making. Finally, they reflect on which patterns might suffer most from claims of illegitimacy from European electorates. SCOPUS: ch. binfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
50|$|Species {{complexes}} {{exist in}} all groups of organisms. They are {{identified by the}} rigorous study of differences between individual species, making use of minute morphological details, tests of reproductive isolation, or DNA-based methods such as molecular phylogenetics or DNA barcoding. The existence of extremely similar species may cause local and global species diversity to be underestimated. Recognizing similar but distinct species is important for disease and pest control, and in conservation biology, although drawing <b>dividing</b> <b>lines</b> <b>between</b> species can be inherently difficult.|$|R

5|$|The winter fur is dense, {{but short}} and closely fitting. In {{northern}} subspecies, the fur {{is soft and}} silky, but coarse in southern forms. The summer fur is very short, sparser and rougher. The upper parts in the summer fur are dark, but vary geographically from dark-tawny or dark-chocolate to light pale tawny or sandy. The lower parts, including the lower jaw and inner sides of the legs, are white. There is often a brown spot {{at the corner of}} the mouth. The <b>dividing</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> the dark upper and light lower parts is usually straight but sometimes forms an irregular line. The tail is brown, and sometimes the tip is a little darker but it is never black. In the northern part of its range and at high altitudes, the least weasel changes colour in the winter, the coat becoming pure white and exhibiting a few black hairs in rare circumstances.|$|E
5|$|As M-37 crosses into Lake County, {{the highway}} crosses the Pere Marquette River. US10 follows M-37 through Baldwin. The Marquette Rail line turns westward {{on the edge}} of town, and north of Baldwin, the highway forms the <b>dividing</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> the Manistee National Forest to the west and the Pere Marquette State Forest to the east. The road crosses the Little Manistee River near Peacock and the Pine River in {{southwest}} Wexford County. M-37 curves to the northeast {{along the edge of the}} Hodenpyl Dam Pond near Mesick. M-37 turns east to follow M-115 through the community and then returns to a northward course into Sherman and on to Buckley. North of the latter community, the highway crosses into Grand Traverse County. The area around Buckley transitions to agricultural use again. This landscape continues past the M-113 to the area known as Chums Corners. There, M-37 merges with US31, and the two run through a small unincorporated community that is host to Wuerfel Park, home of the Traverse City Beach Bums, a minor league baseball team.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the river}} reaches the {{outskirts}} of Hull, its course {{is marked by a}} series of bridges, most of which open to allow boats to pass. There are swing bridges, lift bridges and bascule bridges, and the river becomes part of the Port of Hull. The river, which is the <b>dividing</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> West and East Hull, bisects the city's industrial area. The bridges can cause traffic delays during high tides, though river traffic is less than it once was. The Beverley and Barmston Drain rejoins the river above Scott Street Bridge. Below North Bridge, an unused dry dock on the west bank marks the former entrance to Queens Dock. Below Drypool Bridge, a muddy basin on the east bank was once the entrance to Drypool Basin and Victoria Dock. The river reaches its confluence with the Humber estuary in the centre of Kingston upon Hull. At its mouth, a tidal barrier has been constructed to prevent tidal surges from entering the river. In the past, these had regularly flooded the town and the flat countryside to the north.|$|E

5|$|The sixth {{line into}} Preston {{was that of}} the Preston and Blackburn Railway, which opened on 1 June 1846, joining the North Union line {{immediately}} south of Farrington Station (respelt “Farington” from October 1857). The railway company was absorbed into the East Lancashire Railway (ELR) on 3 August 1846. Once again, the NUR charged high tolls for the use of its line which led the ELR to build its own line into Preston. The line was initially opposed by Preston Corporation, but was eventually permitted on condition that the embankment north of the Ribble (which later became the <b>dividing</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> Avenham and Miller Parks) be ornamentally laid out, and that a pedestrian path (still in use today) be provided on the river bridge. The line ran into new platforms built {{on the east side of}} the North Union station, which were managed and staffed by the ELR, and which had their own booking hall and entrance in Butler Street. The new platforms were effectively a separate station. The new line and station opened on 2 September 1850.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Voalavo also {{resembles that of}} Eliurus, with a long facial skeleton, an hourglass-shaped interorbital region (between the eyes), and a smooth interorbital region and braincase, without ridges or shelves. Other shared {{characteristics}} include an essentially featureless bony palate, without many pits and ridges, and a broad mesopterygoid fossa (the opening behind the palate). In other characteristics, Voalavo resembles some but not all species of Eliurus. For example, {{the length of the}} incisive foramina matches the maximum seen in Eliurus species (in this case, in Major's tufted-tailed rat and White-tipped tufted-tailed rat). The back margin of the incisive foramen is rounded in eastern voalavo, but angular in northern voalavo. The two species also differ {{in the shape of the}} suture (<b>dividing</b> <b>line)</b> <b>between</b> the maxillary and palatine bones, which is straight in eastern voalavo, but more curved in northern voalavo. The capsular process, a projection at the back of the mandible (lower jaw) that houses the root of the lower incisor, is indistinct in Voalavo, a feature it shares with Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat, Major's tufted-tailed rat, and Petter's tufted-tailed rat, but not the other species of Eliurus.|$|E
5|$|By 48 BC, {{after having}} {{defeated}} {{the last of}} his major enemies, Julius Caesar wanted to ensure that his control over the government was undisputed. He assumed these powers by increasing his own authority, and by decreasing the authority of Rome's other political institutions. Caesar held the office of Roman Dictator, and alternated between the Consulship (the chief-magistracy) and the Proconsulship (in effect, a military governorship). In 48 BC, Caesar was given the powers of a Plebeian Tribune, which made his person sacrosanct, gave him the power to veto the Senate, and allowed him to dominate the legislative process. After Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC, Mark Antony formed an alliance with Caesar's adopted son and great-nephew, Gaius Octavian. Along with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, they formed an alliance known as the Second Triumvirate, and held powers that were nearly identical to the powers that Caesar had held under his constitution. While the conspirators who had assassinated Caesar were defeated at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC, the peace that resulted was only temporary. Antony and Octavian fought against each other in one last battle in 31 BC. Antony was defeated, and in 30 BC he committed suicide. In 29 BC, Octavian returned to Rome as the unchallenged master of the state. The reign of Octavian, whom history remembers as Augustus, the first Roman Emperor, marked the <b>dividing</b> <b>line</b> <b>between</b> the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire. By the time this process was complete, Rome had completed its transition from a city-state with a network of dependencies, to the capital of an empire.|$|E
