40|$|The {{objective}} of this research work {{was to investigate the}} low temperature gold silicon eutectic bonding of SMA with silicon wafers. The research work was carried out to optimize a bond process with better yield and <b>higher</b> <b>bond</b> <b>strength.</b> The gold layer thickness, processing temperature, diffusion barrier, adhesive layer, and the removal of silicon oxide are the important parameters in determining a reliable and uniform bond. Based on the previous work on Au-Si eutectic bonding, 7 different Si substrates were prepared to investigate the effect of above mentioned parameters. Cantilevers with different bond sizes were prepared from SMA and steel sheets. Afterwards, these cantilevers were bonded to the prepared substrates. The bond yield and <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> are the two parameters which establish the bond quality. Quantitative analysis was carried out by shear tests. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Mapping were used for the analysis of the bond interface and diffusion of elements across the bond. The research has resulted in bonding of SMA cantilevers onto silicon wafers with <b>high</b> yield and <b>bond</b> <b>strength.</b> <b>Steel</b> cantilever can also be bonded by Au-Si eutectic alloy but the processing of the steel sheet is critical.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} shear <b>bond</b> <b>strengths</b> (SBS) of {{stainless}} steel brackets bonded to artificially-aged composite restorations after different surface treatments. Methods: Forty-five premolar teeth were restored with a nano-hybrid composite (Tetric EvoCeram), stored in deionised water for one week and randomly divided into three equal groups: Group I, the restorations were exposed to 5 per cent hydrofluoric acid for 60 seconds; Group II, the restorations were abraded with a micro-etcher (50 μm alumina particles); Group III, the restorations were roughened with a coarse diamond bur. Similar premolar brackets were bonded to each restoration using the same resin adhesive and the specimens were then cycled in deionised water between 5 °C and 55 °C (500 cycles). The shear <b>bond</b> <b>strengths</b> were determined with a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. The teeth and brackets were examined under a stereomicroscope and the adhesive remnants on the teeth scored with the adhesive remnant index (ARI). Results: Specimens treated with the diamond bur had a significantly higher SBS (Mean: 18. 45 ± 3. 82 MPa) than the group treated with hydrofluoric acid (Mean: 12. 85 ± 5. 20 MPa). The mean SBS difference between the air-abrasion (Mean: 15. 36 ± 4. 92 MPa) and hydrofluoric acid groups was not significant. High ARI scores occurred following abrasion with a diamond bur (100 per cent) and micro-etcher (80 per cent). In approximately {{two thirds of the}} teeth no adhesive was left on the restoration after surface treatment with hydofluoric acid. Conclusion: Surface treatment with a diamond bur resulted in a <b>high</b> <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> between stainless <b>steel</b> brackets and artificially-aged composite restorations and was considered to be a safe and effective method of surface treatment.

40|$|Conventional {{unreinforced}} masonry walls {{subject to}} in-plane shear loading fail due to exceedance of shear and tensile <b>bond</b> <b>strengths.</b> This paper examines {{whether or not}} the in-plane shear capacity of masonry walls would increase with the increase in the <b>bond</b> <b>strengths</b> through experimental and numerical investigations. For these investigations, shear walls were built with <b>high</b> <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> polymer cement mortar; they were applied in thin layers of 2 mm thickness each. Material tests were carried out to characterise the bond and the compressive <b>strengths</b> of the <b>high</b> <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> thin layer mortared masonry; the <b>bond</b> <b>strengths</b> were found approximately double that of the conventional 10 mm thick cement mortars. The shear walls, however, exhibited significantly lower capacity (contrasting the expectation) and displayed base course sliding mode of failure. To ascertain the validity of the experimental results, a combined surface contact - interface element micro finite element (FE) modelling technique was formulated; the results adequately reproduced the experimental datasets. The validated FE model was then applied to examine the effect of the aspect ratios and pre-compression levels to the failure modes, deformation and <b>strength</b> of the <b>high</b> <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> shear walls and is shown that once the pre-compression exceeds 15 % of the masonry compressive strength, the base sliding failure mode changes to the diagonal cracking mode with corresponding increase in in-plane shear capacity.

30|$|<b>Higher</b> <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> in ECC {{specimens}} {{could also}} {{be attributed to the}} generation of high radial confinement due to the presence of PVA fiber and transverse reinforcement. In the beam specimens, the concrete surrounding the GFRP bar was under tension, making the beam specimens more susceptible to cracking. The strain hardening and micro-cracking characteristics of ECC would provide more resistance to such cracking compared to NC. The fiber-bridging tends to stop the propagation of splitting cracks (initiated when the tangential bond stress exceeds the tensile strength of ECC) leading to comparatively ductile pullout failure of all ECC specimens rather than splitting. The confinement provided by the crack bridging combined with higher energy absorption for crack propagation {{can be attributed to the}} improved <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> of ECC. Previous research studies also confirmed such improved <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> in <b>steel</b> fiber reinforced concrete (Ezeldin and Balaguru 1989; Soroushian et al. 1991; ACI 446.1 R- 91 (1991).

40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: In {{clinical}} practice, {{loss of adhesion}} {{between the}} silicone-based denture liner and the denture base resin is always an undesirable event that might cause loss of material softness, water sorption, bacterial colonization and functional failure of the prosthesis. PURPOSE: This study evaluated the effect of thermocycling on tensile and shear <b>bond</b> <b>strengths</b> of three soft liner materials to a denture base acrylic resin. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Three resilient liners (Mucopren-Soft, Mollosil-Plus and Dentusil) and a heat-polymerized acrylic resin (QC- 20) were processed according to manufacturers' directions. Sixty specimens (14 x 14 mm cross-sectional area) per <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> test (20 for each liner) were fabricated and either stored in water at 37 ºC for 24 hours (control groups; n= 10) or thermocycled 3, 000 times in water between 5 ºC and 55 ºC (test groups; n= 10). The specimens were tested in tensile and shear strength in a universal testing machine until fracture. <b>Bond</b> <b>strength</b> means were compared between water-stored and thermocycled groups for each material, as well as among materials for each treatment (water storage or thermocycling). Failure mode (adhesive, cohesive and mixed) after debonding was assessed. Data were analyzed statistically by paired Student's t-test and ANOVA at 5 % significance level. RESULTS: The water-stored groups had statistically significant <b>higher</b> <b>bond</b> <b>strengths</b> than the thermocycled groups (p< 0. 05). Without thermocycling, Mucopren-Soft (2. 83 ± 0. 48 MPa) had <b>higher</b> <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> than Mollosil-Plus (1. 04 ± 0. 26 MPa) and Dentusil (1. 14 ± 0. 51 MPa).

40|$|The <b>bonding</b> <b>strength</b> between {{resin cement}} and posts is {{important}} for post and core restorations. An important method of improving the <b>bonding</b> <b>strength</b> {{is the use of}} various surface pretreatments of the post. In this study, the surfaces of zirconia (fiber) posts were treated by mechanical and/or chemical methods such as sandblasting and silanization. The <b>bonding</b> <b>strength</b> between the zirconia (fiber) post and the resin cement was measured by a push-out method after thermocycling based on the adhesion to Panavia F 2. 0 resin cement. The zirconia and fiber posts exhibited different <b>bonding</b> <b>strengths</b> after sandblasting and/or silanization because of the different strengths and chemical structures. The zirconia post showed a <b>high</b> <b>bonding</b> <b>strength</b> of up to 17. 1 MPa after a combined treatment of sandblasting and silanization because of the rough surface and covalent bonds at the interface. This effect was also enhanced by using 1, 2 -bis(trimethoxysilyl) ethane for the formation of a flexible layer at the interface. In contrast, a <b>high</b> <b>bonding</b> <b>strength</b> of 13. 9 MPa was obtained for the fiber post treated by silane agents because the sandblasting treatment resulted in damage to the fiber post, as observed by scanning electron microscopy. The results indicated that the improvement in the <b>bonding</b> <b>strength</b> between the post and the resin cement could be controlled by different chemical and/or mechanical treatments. Enhanced <b>bonding</b> <b>strength</b> depended on covalent bonding and the surface roughness.

Although {{several studies}} {{evaluating}} the mechanical properties of Ce-TZP/Al 2 O 3 have been published, to date, no {{study has been}} published investigating the bonding protocol between Ce-TZP/Al 2 O 3 and resin cement. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the shear <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> to air-abraded Ce-TZP/Al 2 O 3 when primers and two different cement types were used. Materials and Methods. Two types of zirconia (Y-TZP and Ce-TZP/Al 2 O 3) specimens were further divided into four subgroups according to primer application and the cement used. Shear <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> was measured after water storage for 3 days or 5, 000 times thermocycling for artificial aging. Results. The Y-TZP block showed significantly <b>higher</b> shear <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> than the Ce-TZP/Al 2 O 3 block generally.

Additional dentin surfaces were conditioned and bonded as previously described. They were prepared for the microscopy study and finally observed using confocal microscopy. Results: The ethanol wet <b>bonding</b> technique gave <b>higher</b> <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> values for all the adhesives tested: in Group I (water wet bonding technique) no {{significant difference was found}} between the resins tested; the only exception being the most hydrophilic Resin # 4 showing the <b>highest</b> <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> values (P< 0. 05). In Group 2 (ethanol wet bonding technique) no statistical differences were present between Resin #A and Resin #D. Resin #C showed the <b>highest</b> <b>bond</b> <b>strength</b> values. Confocal microscopy showed better resin diffusion and hybrid layer formation when the ethanol wet bonding was used. (Am J Dent 2011; 24 : 25 - 30) ...|$|R
