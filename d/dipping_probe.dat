40|$|Oxygen (O 2) {{is one of}} {{the primary}} {{controls}} on the biogeochemistry of wetland soils. Its availability regulates both the production and consumption of important greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) in the soil, and thereby potential emission of these gases to the atmosphere. The application of chemical optical sensors (<b>Dipping</b> <b>Probe</b> DP-PSt 3) connected to a multi-channel oxygen meter (OXY- 10 mini) by PreSens enabled reliable, long term measurements in different soil depths in a Danish wetland. Results revealed complex interactions between daily and seasonal changes in O 2 and mineral nitrogen availability. In wetland soil the O 2 availabiltiy is often limited by high soil water contents and the position of the water table. As Northern wetlands store about 30 % of the global subsurface organic carbon (C) pools and function as net sources of these important greenhouse gases, detailed knowledge on the O 2 availability and O 2 dynamics in the soil is crucial for understanding both current greenhouse gas producing and consuming processes and ne...|$|E
3000|$|The PPR {{consists}} of two superconducting films and one dielectric spacer, and the spacer is placed between these two superconductor films to form a sandwich structure. The resonator is then placed inside a small cavity made of oxygen free high-conductivity copper (OFHC) which is gold (purity > 99.9  %) plated to minimize the radiation loss. The details of this device are well described in some references [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. Here, we use sputtered Nb films (for measurement up to 9  K), and YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 −δ [...] (YBCO) films deposited on sapphire substrates (for measurement up to 80  K) by sputtering deposition. For the dielectric spacer, we choose several different materials. These include 2 -in. silicon wafers (Virginia Semiconductor Inc., Fredericksburg, VA, USA) of both undoped [25  μm thick ultrathin®, (100) orientation, resistivity > 20  Ω-cm] and lightly doped n-type (125  μm thick) ones, Teflon® FEP films (Du Pont Electronics, Wilmington, DE, USA, 12.5  μm thick), two-side polished c-sapphire substrates (1  cm ×  1  cm ×  0.5  mm), and thin chips Ba(Zn 1 / 3 Ta 2 / 3)O 3 ceramics doped with different amount of Ni ion substituting Zn position [one can think it as a solid alloy of xBa(Ni 1 / 3 Ta 2 / 3)O 3 —(1  − x) Ba(Zn 1 / 3 Ta 2 / 3)O 3] [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. The ceramic was sintered by traditional powder processing method [1, 2, 3]. The Ni-doped BZT sample was processed as described in [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. First, the pure BZT and Ba(Ni 1 / 3 Ta 2 / 3)O 3 (BNT) powder were synthesized separately. Then, the BZT and BNT powder were mixed into slurry according to desired atomic ratio by ball milling. The resulting mixed powder was then used to sinter Ni-doped BZT ceramic samples. The undoped and lightly doped silicon wafers in this work will come into carrier freeze-out zone at 4.2  K and shows a very low microwave loss tangent. The cavity loaded with the sample is then affixed {{to the end of}} a cryogenic <b>dipping</b> <b>probe</b> which is then inserted into the liquid Helium Dewar. Two 50 -Ω semi-rigid coaxial microwave cable was put inside the <b>dipping</b> <b>probe,</b> at one ends with metal outer conductor peeled off to make coupling microwave feeding probes for the ceramic sample in the metal cavity, and at the other end connected to the HP 8510 C vector network analyzer, from which S 12 or S 21 network parameters can be collected. The coupling probes can be moved close or away from the resonator to excite resonance modes. These values are fit to a circle in the Smith chart to infer the quality factor. The distance between coupling loops and sample is adjusted to be weakly coupled so that the unloaded Q can be determined to better than a few percent. Because only the value of the quality factor is sufficient to infer the loss tangent, a calibrated measurement is not required. The input source power should be chosen neither too large in case of the nonlinear effect [16, 20], nor too small to get a good signal to noise ratio of the S 12 or S 21 signal intensity. It should be kept above 10 – 15  db to measure an accurate 3 -db bandwidth of the transmission coefficient. The distance between tips of coaxial probes and the resonator was adjusted to be within tenths of a millimeter to get a weak coupling, in which case the loaded Q and unloaded Q is approximately equal to each other. Usually, at the beginning of the experiment, the probes were moved barely touch the sample. During the experiment, the distance was increased to lower the coupling coefficient until the weak coupling needed reached. The sharp peaks in S 21 or S 12 diagram correspond to the resonant modes. These modes can be distinguished from the cavity modes easily by observing the shift of resonate frequency [15, 16, 17] with the change of temperature, while the cavity modes do not shift obviously.|$|E

This device relies on diode laser excitation and a charged-coupled device spectrometer and functions on a technique of sandwich immunoassay. As a proof of principle, this technique was applied in a quantitative estimation of interleukin IL- 6.

40|$|A multiwavelength {{spectrophotometric}} {{approach has}} been developed to determine acid dissociation constants (pKa values) of sparingly soluble drug compounds. UV absorption spectra of the drug solution are acquired using a versatile device based on a fiber optics <b>dip</b> <b>probe,</b> a light source and a photodiode array (PDA) detector while the pH and the ionic strength of the chemical system is manipulated precisely {{by means of a}} commercially available titrator. Target factor analysis (TFA) has been applied to deduce the pKa values from the multiwavelength UV absorption data recorded at different pH values. We have called this multiwavelength approach the WApH technique because the pKa results are determined from changes in Wavelength and Absorbance as a function of pH (WApH). The WApH technique is exemplified by using several pure drugs, namely, niflumic acid, nitrazepam, pyridoxine, quinine and terbutaline. The pKa values obtained agree well with those derived from pH-metric titrations. It has been demonstrated that the WApH technique is able to deduce pKa values with high accuracy even if the absorption spectra of the reacting species are very similar. © 1998 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Purpose In a biphasic system, a drug {{molecule}} may partition from an {{aqueous phase}} to an immiscible organic phase {{in a process}} that is thought to be similar to passive diffusion of drugs across biological membranes. A Design of Experiments (DoE) model was used to explore the effects of pH, organic solvent type, excipients and biorelevant media on the partitioning rate. Methods Minitab 17 was used to design a 62 ½ fractional factorial model with center points. Only individual and 2 -level interactions were analyzed and the alias structure showed that these were only confounded by 4 -level interactions and above. 38 experiments were required, which were randomized in their run order. The Sirius inForm was used to run single sector biphasic dissolution experiments on indomethacin and dipyridamole. Here, the media was automatically added to the experiment vessel and equilibrated at 37 °C. The sample was prepared as a 10 mM stock solution using DMSO and then automatically added to the aqueous layer using a needle. A UV <b>dip</b> <b>probe</b> was used to collect UV absorbance data from the organic layer, which was converted to concentration and plotted against time. The area under the curve was integrated and entered into the Minitab DoE model for analysis. Results The rate of partition was positively correlated with lipophilicity for dipyridamole, but was negatively correlated for indomethacin. The negative correlation was ascribed to a precipitation event of indomethacin in the aqueous phase that occurred at low pH. The addition of biorelevant components and excipients was negatively correlated with partition rate, except for sodium tauroucholate which was positively correlated with ionized dipyridamole. The less polar organic solvent was more sensitive to changes in lipophilicity than the more polar solvent. Conclusion Clear trends were observed with five of the six factors tested here. By understanding how each factor can affect the partition rate, {{it may be possible to}} optimise the in vitro system for correlation with in vivo bioavailability data...|$|R
40|$|Within the UK and overseas, {{there are}} {{increasing}} scientific and water industry needs to acquire spatially and temporally intensive measurements of levels and molecular character of {{dissolved organic carbon}} (DOC) in the aquatic environment. The need is particularly acute in upland catchments that are often crucial for drinking water supply, and where DOC concentrations are high and have been increasing in recent years. Spectrometer-based systems currently {{on the market for}} this purpose are heavy, cumbersome, have a large power requirement, not sensitive in low light conditions, measure absorbance at single wavelengths, require frequent recalibration by trained operators and provide data based on hidden algorithms that limit interpretation of the resulting data. We have developed a new smaller, lighter, and self-calibrating instrument, combining novel miniaturisation of Fourier Transform Spectrometry, and a new scientifically peer-reviewed (and published) approach to assessing DOC concentrations in water. The portable sensor system uses a xenon flash lamp, where the light pulse is collimated and focused into one input of a bifurcated fibre <b>dip</b> <b>probe.</b> At the fibre tip, light is collimated and reflected in the water sample region over a total path length of 5 mm. Shorter wavelengths (near the UV) are absorbed due to water containing DOC concentration. Light from the output end of the bifurcated fibre is collimated and coupled to the micro Fourier Transform Spectrometer. Within the interferometer, a broadband beam splitter and two concave mirrors are used to create an optical path difference between the beams. A UV sensitive detector is placed at the focus point of the generated interferogram. The interferogram is recorded and a Fourier Transform is applied to retrieve the spectral data. An absorbance of the DOC is measured and when a ratio is taken between the water sample containing DOC and DI water. Both detector and flash-lamp are triggered by an on-board dual wavefunction generator with a delay of 100 us between the pulses.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the microwave properties of nanoparticles for use as contrast and hyperthermia agents. Currently, visible light is used for irradiation of nanoparticles as hyperthermia agents. Additionally, visible/Near-infrared light is used for photoacoustic tomography (PAT) imaging. Compared to optical wavelengths, frequencies in microwave range transmit through tissue with high penetration depth. Thus, deep cancerous cells and malignant tissue may be treated and imaged. These nanoparticles could enable {{the use of a}} hybrid microwave/acoustic technique known as thermoacoustic tomography. Here, quantitative measurements of the heat generation in super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (SPIONs), gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) induced by microwave energy at 3 GHz, are presented and compared. Based on our experiments, SPIONs are the most efficient nanoparticles for microwave heating. Very high concentrations of SPIONs are able to convert microwave energy into heat about 22 ? C more than DI-water. AuNPs, which support plasmon resonances, do not provide heat under microwave irradiation as predicted by our computational analysis based on Mie Theory. AuNCs are a new form of ultra-small (< 2. 5 nm) AuNPs which do not support plasmonic resonances and have supra-molecular properties such as sub-conduction band transitions. Interestingly, AuNCs have the potential to absorb microwave energy and may provide an alternative to SPIONs. These nanoparticles had not yet been studied before in this frequency region. In addition, the absorption coefficient of nanoparticles were calculated using complex permittivity data from a <b>dip</b> <b>probe</b> kit and a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) in a broad band range from 500 MHZ to 10 GHz. This method allows identification of best frequency region with highest penetration depth. In the last step, the nanoparticles with different concentrations were tested as exogenous contrast agents in a Thermoacoustic Tomography (TAT) system. TAT utilizes the penetration depth of microwave energy while producing high resolution images through acoustic waves. The addition of an exogenous contrast agent improves image quality by more effectively converting microwave energy to heat. The experiment reveals that the time resolved thermoacoustic signal (TA) from SPIONs is stronger than AuNPs and AuNCs and thus, the image contrast produced by SPIONs is stronger than the two other aforementioned nanoparticles...|$|R

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy of the University of LutonThe research presented in this thesis describes the development and application of a portable, high-resolution instrument, specifically designed for the at-site monitoring of algae and cyanobacteria in freshwaters. The instrument incorporates a miniature charge-coupled device (CCD) based spectrometer and a low power combined deutelium and tungsten light source, enabling the absorbance to be measured between 200 - 850 nm at a resolution of 1. 3 nm. A transmission <b>dip</b> <b>probe</b> with removable tips of 5, 10 and 40 mm pathlengths forms the sampling device. A specifically developed control program allows easy operation of the instrument. A linear response from 0. 0 - 1. 2 AU and a combined {{signal to noise ratio}} of 576 : 1 for the instrument components resulting in a high baseline stability of 1. 0 mAU drift over five hundred measurements being observed. The instrument provides in-vivo absorbance characteristics with high resolution across the visible spectrum. Up to twelve specific spectral features were commonly identified in the absorbance spectra of algae and cyanobacteria between 400 - 750 nm. Individual spectral features were linked to specific pigments, some of which were found to be taxonomically distinct. Fourth derivative analysis was proven to provide further enhancement of subtle spectral features. The instrument has a linear range for chlorophyll a up to 1000 !lg rl and a detection limit of 8) lg rl using the 40 mm pathlength probe. Physiological adaptation to light and nutrient conditions were shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the in-vivo absorbance spectrum, therefore providing potential information on physiological status and health of a natural sample. Spectral analysis using principal component analysis (PCA) with classification based on the soft independent modelling of class analogy (SIMCA) method was used to classify nine species from three taxonomic classes, including four cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa, Anabaena variabilis, Aphanizornenon flos-aquae, Synechnococcus sp.), four chlorophyceae (Chlorella vulgaris, Scenedesmus acuminatus, Spirogyra mirabilis, Staurastrurn chaetoceros) and a single bacillariophyceae (Asterionella Formosa). Classification using the SIMCA method proved to be highly reliable and robust. Moreover, the addition of noise was found to have very little effect on the classification. Under laboratory conditions all nine species were correctly classified using 'unknown' spectra. At-site classification of natural samples and laboratory simulations have shown the robustness and reliability of the developed portable instrument. In combination with the data analysis techniques, the instrument is well suited to the proactive at-site assessment of algal and cyanobacterial blooms in eutrophic freshwater environments...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{algorithms}} and automation to do {{chemistry and}} formulation {{have the potential}} to speed up discovery. In this thesis, a series of new approaches are explored. First, a genetic algorithm was employed as an evolutionary algorithm, with its mono-objective and multi-objective variant to optimise viscous formulations. An autonomous platform was designed to mix and stir multiple ingredients that are liquid and solid at room temperature. Viscosity, pH and opacity of mixtures are analysed and then used as input for the evolutionary algorithm, which designs the consecutive experiments according to the fitness gathered for each formulation. This procedure is repeated in a closed loop until the overall fitness of the optimisation reaches an optimum result and finds a compromise with respect to the targeted physical properties. Secondly, a multifunctional automated platform was built to perform a set of reactions involving the formation of molybdenum blue nanoclusters. The crystallisation and further analysis were automated. In addition, the rig was used to test the ability to keep a solution of polyoxometalates at a stable redox potential during the addition of various oxidants and reductants. The fuzzy logic controller was employed to stat the redox potential of the solution under equilibrium and non-equilibrium regimes. Finally, the platform was used to apply modified redox oscillations on the polyoxometalates with the aim of forming and breaking novel building blocks that are hard to isolate in a traditional batch reaction. Thirdly, the same fuzzy logic approach was used, which is far from equilibrium a system of organic macrocycles of different sizes. The hypothesis for this approach {{is to be able to}} track the emergence of novel structures like the stacking of the macrocycles and the formation of nanowires of different lengths. Experimentally, an oxidant and a reducing agent were added to dithiol solution enabling the formation and the destruction of organic macrocycles with different sizes. The reaction was followed using an online UV-Vis <b>dip</b> <b>probe</b> and online HPLC. The dynamics of this system under non-equilibrium conditions enabling the detection of emergent species (macrocycles with different sizes, beta sheets from the stacking of the macrocycles to form nanowires with different lengths) that are undetectable under an equilibrium.

The validation of the algorithms was performed on mainly two nonlinear chemical systems. These metaheuristics showed very good performance to detect the optimum solutions at high and low resolutions.

40|$|To {{support the}} {{demonstration}} of a more proliferation-resistant nuclear fuel processing plant, techniques and instrumentation to allow the real-time, online determination of special nuclear material concentrations in-process must be developed. An ideal materials accountability technique for proliferation resistance should provide nondestructive, realtime, on-line information of metal and ligand concentrations in separations streams without perturbing the process. UV-Visible spectroscopy can be adapted for this precise purpose in solvent extraction-based separations. The primary goal of this project is to understand fundamental URanium EXtraction (UREX) and Plutonium-URanium EXtraction (PUREX) reprocessing chemistry and corresponding UV-Visible spectroscopy for application in process monitoring for safeguards. By evaluating the impact of process conditions, such as acid concentration, metal concentration and flow rate, on {{the sensitivity of the}} UV-Visible detection system, the process-monitoring concept is developed from an advanced application of fundamental spectroscopy. Systematic benchtop-scale studies investigated the system relevant to UREX or PUREX type reprocessing systems, encompassing 0. 01 - 1. 26 M U and 0. 01 - 8 M HNO 3. A laboratory-scale TRansUranic Extraction (TRUEX) demonstration was performed and used both to analyze for potential online monitoring opportunities in the TRUEX process, and to provide the foundation for building and demonstrating a laboratory-scale UREX demonstration. The secondary goal of the project is to simulate a diversion scenario in UREX and successfully detect changes in metal concentration and solution chemistry in a counter current contactor system with a UV-Visible spectroscopic process monitor. UREX uses the same basic solvent extraction flowsheet as PUREX, but has a lower acid concentration throughout and adds acetohydroxamic acid (AHA) as a complexant/reductant to the feed solution to prevent the extraction of Pu. By examining UV-Visible spectra gathered in real time, the objective is to detect the conversion from the UREX process, which does not separate Pu, to the PUREX process, which yields a purified Pu product. The change in process chemistry can be detected in the feed solution, aqueous product or in the raffinate stream by identifying the acid concentration, metal distribution and {{the presence or absence of}} AHA. A fiber optic <b>dip</b> <b>probe</b> for UV-Visible spectroscopy was integrated into a bank of three counter-current centrifugal contactors to demonstrate the online process monitoring concept. Nd, Fe and Zr were added to the uranyl nitrate system to explore spectroscopic interferences and identify additional species as candidates for online monitoring. This milestone is a demonstration of the potential of this technique, which lies in the ability to simultaneously and directly monitor the chemical process conditions in a reprocessing plant, providing inspectors with another tool to detect nuclear material diversion attempts. Lastly, dry processing of used nuclear fuel is often used as a head-end step before solvent extraction-based separations such as UREX or TRUEX. A non-aqueous process, used fuel treatment by dry processing generally includes chopping of used fuel rods followed by repeated oxidation-reduction cycles and physical separation of the used fuel from the cladding. Thus, dry processing techniques are investigated and opportunities for online monitoring are proposed for continuation of this work in future studies...|$|R
40|$|This {{work was}} {{performed}} {{as part of}} a broader effort to automate analytical methods for determining plutonium and other radioisotopes in environmental samples. The work described here represented a screening study to evaluate the effect of applying ultrasonic irradiation to dissolve high-fired plutonium oxide. The major findings of this work can be summarized as follows: (1) High-fired plutonium oxide does not undergo measurable dissolution when sonicated in nitric acid solutions, even at a high concentration range of nitric acid where the calculated thermodynamic solubility of plutonium oxide exceeds the ?g/mL level. (2) Applying organic complexants (nitrilotriacetic acid) and reductants (hydroxyurea) in 1. 5 M nitric acid does not significantly increase the dissolution compared with digestion in nitric acid alone. Nearly all (99. 5 %) of the plutonium oxide remains undissolved under these conditions. (3) The action of a strong inorganic reductant, titanium trichloride in 25 wt% HCl, results in 40 % dissolution of the plutonium oxide when the titanium trichloride concentration is ? 1 wt% under sonication. (4) Oxidative treatment of plutonium oxide by freshly dissolved AgO ({approx} 20 mg/mL) in 1. 5 M nitric acid with sonication resulted in 95 % plutonium oxide dissolution. However, the same treatment of plutonium oxide mechanically mixed with 50 mg of Columbia River sediment (CRS) results in a significant decrease of dissolution yield of plutonium oxide (< 20 % dissolved at the same AgO loading) because of parasitic consumption of AG(II) by oxidizable components of the CRS. (5) Digesting plutonium oxide in HF resulted in dissolution yields slightly higher than 80 % for HF concentration from 6 M to 14 M. Sonication did not result in any improvement in dissolution efficiency in HF. (6) Mixed nitric acid/HF solutions result in a higher dissolution yield of plutonium oxide compared with digestion in HF alone (at the same HF concentrations). Practically quantitative dissolution of PuO 2 can be achieved with 6 to 8 M nitric acid + 14 M HF or 8 M nitric acid + 4 M HF mixtures. In the latter case, quantitative dissolution of plutonium oxide was demonstrated only with sonication. Overall, the results indicate that applying ultrasound in an isolated cup horn configuration to dissolve refractory plutonium oxide does not offer any substantial advantage over conventional ?heat and mix? treatment. Oxidative treatment by AgO appears to be effective only when very little or no oxidizable materials are present in the digested sample. The catalytic use of Ag(II) in the ''Catalyzed Electrolytic Plutonium Oxide Dissolution'' technology would probably be more effective than using AgO because the Ag(II) is continually regenerated electrochemically. Reductive treatment with titanium trichloride in HCl solution proves to be less efficient than the previously observed effect based on in situ generation of Ti(III) in phosphoric acid and sulfuric acid media using a <b>dip</b> <b>probe</b> sonication setup. The previous experiments, however, were performed at higher temperature and with non-steady concentration profiles of Ti(III) ion in the process of sonochemical digestion...|$|R

One of the most important operational aspects to optimize is the local turbulence that results in setting the dispersion in the crystallizer to a minimum, without compromising on the mass and heat transfer processes. In this study the residence time distribution of a tracer resulting from various possible operating configurations (amplitude and frequency) in the OFBC is analyzed, for water flows with a net flow Reynolds number of 140 (flowrate 100 ml/min) using dye tracing with an in situ transmission <b>dip</b> <b>probe</b> (absorption spectrophotometry). The best combinations of frequency and amplitude at which narrowest distribution (least dispersion) of the tracer concentration profile is achieved are found to be 1 Hz and 1 mm, 2 Hz and 3. 5 mm and 4 Hz and 1 mm. The experimental results show that the ratio of the oscillatory Reynolds number and the net flow Reynolds number should be between 0. 7 and 5. This is a broader range than the reported 2 to 4 range in literature. The measured residence time distributions for the best oscillatory setting have been successfully fitted to a tanks-in-series model with a 3 % maximum error of the coefficient of determination. It can therefore be concluded that the number of tanks in series is an accurate characteristic parameter of the fluid dynamics. The assumption of ideal plug flow, which is shown to not resemble the real RTD well, can therefore be avoided when developing the model for crystallization in an OFBC. The results of a parameter sensitivity study, based on the developed model, shows that the final seed CSD is weakly related to secondary nucleation for the used kinetic parameters. This can be explained as the small mass of the nucleated crystals does not have a large effect on the supersaturation. Furthermore, the final seed CSD has a dependence on all varied parameters but mostly to the initial seed loading. This is logical as double the initial seed loading will consume double or more amount of solute and therefore slow down the growth rate significantly. Secondary nucleation is very sensitive to the supersaturation profile (with the used kinetics) and so to the imposed temperature profile and the seed loading. The degree of plug flow has very little effect on secondary nucleation because the supersaturation profile is hardly influenced upon variation. A temperature profile optimization showed that in order to minimize secondary nucleation using a five zone temperature control, both a constant zone temperature and a linear zone temperature approach could lower the secondary nucleation by a factor of 2 compared to a single linear zone temperature approach. This underlines the importance of optimization in the OFBC. Intensified Reaction and Seperation SystemProcess & EnergyMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R

The biosensor employed {{for the study of}} assimilation of substrates was fabricated by coupling the immobilized membrane with the DO probe using dialysis tubing, A microbial dispersion containing 0. 2 g of wet weight of the organisms per mL was used for immobilization upon cellulose nitrate membrane. The membrane retaining the fungus was placed on the Teflon membrane of the oxygen electrode so that the fungus was trapped between the two membranes. The linear range was found to be between 2 and 70 ppm (v/v) of acetic acid. A polypropylene net increases the lifetime of the sensor due to its retention of humidity in the net.

40|$|This {{study has}} {{investigated}} the three-dimensional movement of clasts within deformation till, using embedded wireless probes. These probes {{were part of}} an environmental sensor network, which measured subglacial properties (temperature, water pressure, resistivity, case strain and tilt) six times a day, and relayed that data via radio to the glacier surface, where they were forwarded and broadcast on-line. The system was installed at Briksdalsbreen, Norway and operated from August 2004 until August 2006. Approximately 2000 probe days worth of data were collected, with an increase in performance (41 % more readings) during the second year. The probes showed similar patterns of water pressure rises throughout the two years, but with slightly different magnitudes and timings. These changes in water pressure could be related to clast behaviour. The <b>probes</b> decreased their <b>dip</b> over the year, and the rate of change was related to an increase in glacier velocity. After initial changes in <b>dip,</b> the <b>probes</b> experienced changes in orientation, followed by rotation about the a-axis. This continuous rotation was similar to the motion suggested by Jeffery [1922. The motion of ellipsoidal particles immersed in a viscous fluid. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series A 102, 161 – 179] for the behaviour of clasts within a viscous material. In addition, some probes also showed short, frequent dip oscillations in spring and autumn, which were interpreted to reflect stick-slip events, similar to lodging; and demonstrated how local conditions can interrupt the predicted rotation pattern. Overall, it is demonstrated that when water pressures were high, decoupling occurred associated with basal sliding and dip oscillations; and when water pressures fell, the ice and sediment were coupled and till deformation occurred. These events happened during summer and autumn. It is this combination of “lodgement” and deformation that builds up both a complex (but predictable) fabric and a resultant composite till sedimentology...|$|R

The collected water samples from the two sites were first filtrate by Whatman GF/C, 0.6 – 0.7  µm pore size membrane filter to avoid unnecessary large-sized particulate materials (debris) that cause further nutrient release before nutrient analysis was made.|$|R
40|$|This work aims to {{understand}} the mechanism of the thermal degradation of the ethylene-carbon monoxide (E-CO) alternating copolymer under mild conditions. The copolymer was subjected to accelerated ageing in an oven at different temperatures below the copolymer melting point, under argon atmosphere, {{and in the absence}} of light. The properties of the aged samples were compared with the properties of the untreated copolymer. Untreated and aged samples were analysed by mass spectroscopy (MS) with the direct introduction <b>probe</b> (<b>DIP)</b> and pyrolysis (Py) techniques. The accelerated ageing experiments showed that the thermal degradation of the E-CO alternating copolymer under inert atmosphere is characterized by chain cross-linking, loss of water, and changes in the UV absorption spectrum. The IR spectrum shows modifications only for highly degraded samples in which O-H and C=C groups are present. The experiments performed with the DIP-MS technique have confirmed that the E-CO alternating copolymer loses water during its thermal ageing. The pyrolysis products of the copolymer are linear molecules with 1, 4 -diketonic structure, 2 -cyclopentenone derivatives, alkyl furans, and aromatic compounds. These results suggest that during the thermal degradation of the E-CO alternating copolymer under inert atmosphere, and at low temperatures, aldol condensations and/or dehydration to furan rings probably occur...|$|R

An exciting challenge remains the combination of brain imaging and behavioural studies, which associates molecular processes of neuronal communications to their related actions. A pixelated intracerebral probe (PIXSIC) presents a novel strategy using a submillimetric probe for beta+ radiotracer detection based on a pixelated silicon diode that can be stereotaxically implanted in the brain region of interest. This fully autonomous detection system permits time-resolved high sensitivity measurements of radiotracerswith additional imaging features in freelymoving rats. An application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) allows for parallel signal processing of each pixel and enables the wireless operation. All components of the detector were tested and characterized. The beta+ sensitivity of the system was determined with the <b>probe</b> <b>dipped</b> into radiotracer solutions. Monte Carlo simulations served to validate the experimental values and assess the contribution of gamma noise. Preliminary implantation tests on anaesthetized rats proved PIXSIC's functionality in brain tissue.

40|$|Diffusing Wave Spectroscopy (DWS) was {{studied as}} a method of {{laboratory}} analysis of sub-micron particles, and developed as a prospective in-line, industrial, process control sensor, capable of near real-time feedback. No sample pre-treatment was required and measurement was via a non-invasive, flexible, <b>dip</b> in <b>probe.</b> DWS relies on the concept of the diffusive migration of light, as opposed to the ballistic scatter model used in conventional dynamic light scattering. The specific requirements of the optoelectronic hardware, data analysis methods and light scattering model were studied experimentally and, where practical, theoretically resulting in a novel technique of analysis of particle suspensions and emulsions of volume fractions between 0. 01 and 0. 4. Operation at high concentrations made the technique oblivious to dust and contamination. A pure homodyne (autodyne) experimental arrangement described was resilient to environmental disturbances, unlike many other systems which utilise optical fibres or heterodyne operation. Pilot and subsequent prototype development led to a highly accurate method of size ranking, suitable for analysis {{of a wide range of}} suspensions and emulsions. The technique was shown to operate on real industrial samples with statistical variance as low as 0. 3 % with minimal software processing. Whilst the application studied was the analysis of TiO_ 2 suspensions, a diverse range of materials including polystyrene beads, cell pastes and industrial cutting fluid emulsions were tested. Results suggest that, whilst all sizing should be comparative to suitable standards, concentration effects may be minimised and even completely modelled-out in many applications. Adhesion to the optical probe was initially a significant problem but was minimised after the evaluation and use of suitable non stick coating materials. Unexpected behaviour in the correlation in the region of short decay times led to consideration of the effects of rotational diffusion coefficient. The inherent instability of high density suspensions instigated high speed analysis techniques capable of monitoring suspensions that were undergoing rapid change as well as suggesting novel methods for the evaluation of the state of sample dispersion.

40|$|AbstractDexamethansone, a {{synthetic}} steroid, can be oxidized chemically to a ketonic steroid structure that is readily detected by electron capture negative ionization mass spectrometry (ECNI/MS). Previous work from this laboratory {{has demonstrated that}} the chemical oxidation procedure provides advantages of low detection limits and high selectivity for detection of oxidized dexamethasone against chemical background that would otherwise interfere with detection of this steroidal drug in biological samples using more conventional methodology. This report describes {{the extent to which}} tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) can further enhance the selectivity of the oxidation/ECNI methodology for the detection of dexamethasone during the analysis of human plasma and presents evidence that sample introduction by direct inlet <b>probe</b> (<b>DIP)</b> can be used successfully under ECNI conditions. For purposes of comparing the methodologies, the same human plasma samples are analyzed by ECNI, first with detection by conventional mass spectrometry using selected ion monitoring (SIM) and then by MS/MS using selected reaction monitoring (SRM) with sample introduction by the gas chromatographic (GC) inlet and by the DIP. The results indicate that use of the DIP is a viable means of sample introduction for ECNI when sample processing involves the specialized oxidation procedure described herein because the sample matrix does not compete significantly for the thermal electrons in the ion source. Whereas SIM and SRM provide comparable results when sample introduction is achieved by the GC inlet, the MS/MS approach offers the possibility for sample introduction using the DIP, which significantly simplifies and shortens the analysis...|$|R

A dynamic tracking of an evolving droplet size distribution (DSD) in a dilute oil-in water (O/W) emulsion has been developed with the implementation of an in situ video <b>probe</b> <b>dipped</b> in a stirred vessel and coupled with an image analysis treatment. The optical probe allows real time recording 01 20 images of the droplets. Recent image analysis software developed originally for an application in micromechanics was adapted and applied in delayed time on the video sequences regularly recorded. It automatically provided a measurement of the diameter of several thousands of droplets in the range of 10 - 100 mu m. The relative accuracy on the droplet number average diameter was 10 %. This measurement technique was then used to investigate at lab scale in a stirred vessel and in warm conditions the influence of several process parameters on {{the evolution}} with time of a dispersed melted cosmetic ingredient in a water solution containing a surfactant. The specific power input of stirring was the main parameter acting on the reduction of the mean droplet diameter and of the width of the DSD owing to its action on the droplet break-up mechanism. The surfactant concentration was a parameter of secondary relevance on the DSD probably due to the reduction of the coalescence rate and to a faster stabilization of the O/W interface. The use of a flat blade propeller instead of a Rushton turbine was preferable for the production of a narrower DSD. Finally the time required to reach equilibrium was found higher by a factor of 3 - 4 than predicted in the literature...|$|R
30|$|Quantitative {{knowledge}} of how the NP spectra and plasmon resonance wavelength change in a cellular environment can inform many in vitro and in vivo plasmonic NP-mediated applications. For instance, in PTT, metallic nanostructures are excited at their plasmon resonance maximum to cause localized absorption, heating, and destruction of cancer tissue. The NP geometry is designed such that the peak resonance wavelength measured in solution coincides with the emission wavelength of the laser used [4, 28]. However, because the magnitude of spectral shift resulting from intracellular clustering has not been quantified, it is unknown {{how much of a}} mismatch with the laser emission wavelength can arise and if it is significant to consider. Researchers have proposed utilizing the intracellular NP agglomeration effect so that simple solid spherical AuNPs that are restricted to resonance at visible wavelengths can be excited for PTT with infrared wavelengths within the biological transparency window after agglomeration in vivo[29 – 32]. Plasmonic nanostructures are also employed in in vitro studies to study biological processes by using plasmon resonance energy transfer (PRET) [33]. The presence of a biomolecule with an absorption peak coinciding with the resonance peak of a plasmonic NP probe is detected by a <b>dip</b> in the <b>probe's</b> plasmon resonance spectrum [33]. Since the resonance of the NP probe must match the absorption of the molecule of interest for PRET to work, understanding the conditions under which the NP probe resonance may shift upon cellular uptake would help ensure accuracy of PRET. Finally, plasmonic NPs are being explored for multiplexing as multicolor labels for molecular imaging [34, 35] or antennas for photonic gene circuits [36]. In demonstrating the potential of photonic gene circuits, Lee et al. showed that two AuNR antenna populations functionalized with small interfering RNA (siRNA) could differentially release siRNA and thus turn gene circuits ‘off’ or ‘on’ upon excitation with light at one nanorod population's resonance wavelength [36]. However, there was some release of siRNA from the nanorod antenna population that was non-resonant at the light wavelength illuminating the cells [36]. This crosstalk suggests the potential importance of developing methods to fabricate NPs with narrower resonances and considering possible spectral changes in a cellular environment when designing the plasmon resonance characteristics of NP antennas.|$|R
40|$|The direct optical {{viewing of}} an argon {{inductively coupled plasma}} (ICP) through a {{sampling}} orifice inserted directly into the plasma has been accomplished. A copper cone with a sampling orifice {{is attached to the}} entrance slit chamber of a monochromator and inserted directly into an ICP to obtain optical spectra in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV). With solar-blind photomultiplier tube (PMT) detection, detection limits are 50 ng mL[superscript]- 1 for the resonance lines of Br and Cl during injection into the plasma of aerosols of aqueous solutions generated by pneumatic nebulization. With ultrasonic nebulization, the detection limits improve to 8 ng mL[superscript]- 1 for Br and 15 ng mL[superscript]- 1 for Cl. Detection limits for Br and Cl {{in the form of an}} aqueous sample were superior to the best reported values in the Ar and He ICP, and in the microwave-induced plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (MIP-AES) literature. Another significant breakthrough in the present work includes the determination of nonmetals in gases by their direct injection into the ICP by a device called a direct injection <b>probe</b> (<b>DIP).</b> This low dead volume interface (3 ̆c 40 [mu] L) is used for the introduction of gaseous samples directly into the axial channel of the ICP. Injection of a gaseous mixture of compounds containing the elements Br, Cl, S, and C results in detection limits of 0. 1, 0. 3, 0. 05, and 1 ng, respectively. These detection limits are by far the best obtained for these elements in a gaseous form by ICP-AES. The extension of ICP-AES analysis to the determination of nonmetals, metalloids, and/or selected metals in aqueous and gaseous samples illustrates the value of this optical sampling approach in the VUV;Because this optical viewing system does not use any lenses, mirrors, or windows, VUV radiation can be detected down to 78. 7 nm, the wavelength corresponding to the ionization energy of Ar. This ICP-VUV-AES system can therefore be beneficially applied as a diagnostic tool in the examination of excitation mechanisms in the ICP, especially with the observation of the Ar resonance lines at 104. 8 and 106. 7 nm. ftn[superscript]†DOE Report IS-T- 1310.

40|$|The work {{presented}} here describes {{the development of}} an ion source based on atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) that allows the direct mass spectrometric analysis of solid and liquid samples. The ion source makes use of a direct inlet <b>probe</b> (<b>DIP)</b> -system which automatically introduces the samples into the source region using a temperature-programmed push rod. The programmed heating of the push rod leads to a time-shifted vaporization of sample components {{as a result of their}} different vapor pressures. The DIP-APCI ion source was coupled to a high-resolution Q-TOF-MS (Agilent Technologies) and an Ion Trap-MS (Bruker Daltonik) using two different source chambers manufactured at the machine shop of the University of Wuppertal. Gas-flows inside the ion source as well as the position of the probe tip in the ion source were optimized for both the DIP-APCI-Q-TOF-MS and the DIP-APCI-Ion Trap-MS coupling. In positive ionization mode all substances analyzed were detected as protonated molecules ([M+H] +). Ionization in negative ionization mode was made possible by supplying sufficient oxygen to the ion source. In negative ionization mode the formation of [M-H] - - and [M+O 2] ∙- -ions was observed. Using both couplings a linear concentration response was obtained with caffeine as test analyte. This shows the possibility to perform quantitative analyses using the DIP-APCI ion source. Employing the Q-TOF-MS the reproducibility of DIP-APCI-MS analyses was shown by the repeated analysis of an extract from Radix Angelicae sinensis. The possibility to separate sample components by the programmed heating of the push rod was demonstrated by the analysis of hexanoic acid methyl ester and dodecanoic acid methyl ester. The two fatty acid methyl esters were separated almost completely as a result of their differing vapor pressures. The DIP-APCI-Q-TOF-MS coupling was applied to the qualitative analysis of plants used in Chinese Herbal Medicine (CHM). The Chinese Radix Angelicae sinensis and the Korean Radix Angelicae gigas could be differentiated by direct analysis of the powdered plants and augmented detection of coumarins in Radix Angelicae gigas. Processed in Xiao Yao pills, a preparation of several plants used in CHM, the application of the European Radix Angelicae archangelica instead of the Chinese Radix Angelicae sinensis could also be shown via the detection of coumarins. This demonstrates possible applications of DIP-APCI-MS analyses in authenticity tests and in the quality control of plants and preparations used in CHM. The possibility of performing quantitative analyses using the DIP-APCI ion source was shown by the determination of coumarin in cinnamon employing the DIP-APCI-Q-TOF-MS coupling. The DIP-APCI-MS determination of coumarin in cinnamon following extraction was validated and showed satisfying linearity, recovery and reproducibility, both using deuterated coumarin as internal standard and without the use of an internal standard. When deuterated coumarin was used as internal standard, the coumarin contents determined in different cinnamon samples by DIP-APCI-MS were in good agreement with the results obtained by a complementary LC-MS analysis. When no internal standard was used high coumarin contents were overestimated in the LC-MS analysis and underestimated in the DIP-APCI-MS analysis. This shows that the use of deuterated coumarin as internal standard is advisable to obtain accurate data with both methods. The determination of coumarin in woodruff-flavored beverages showed that, using ambient ionization mass spectrometry, special attention has to be paid to possible spectral interferences. By means of LC-MS, coumarin could not be detected in the woodruff-flavored liquor analyzed. Due to the influence of the high temperature applied to the woodruff-flavored liquor during DIP-APCI-MS analysis an isobaric artefact was formed. The temperature-programmed vaporization in combination with the use of deuterated coumarin as internal standard helped in recognizing this spectral interference. Using the DIP-APCI-Ion Trap-MS coupling a non-destructive analysis of phthalates and other plasticizers in plastic articles was performed. The identification of plasticizers was accomplished by MS/MS- and MS 3 -experiments and comparative analysis of plasticizer standards. In this way plasticizers could be identified in toys, plastic articles intended to come into contact with food and other plastic articles of daily use. The DIP-APCI-Ion Trap-MS coupling was also applied to the analysis of active ingredients in analgesics and antibiotics. The active ingredients of analgesics (acetylsalicylic acid, diclofenac, ibuprofen, paracetamol and naproxen) and antibiotics (clarithromycin, rifampicin and ethambutol) could all be detected in the tablets and ointments analyzed. The identities of the active ingredients were confirmed by MS/MS-experiments. In addition to the development of the DIP-APCI ion source a second focus of the work {{presented here}} was the analysis of phloem sap. By means of stylectomy phloem sap was gained from maize and rapeseed plants. The direct analysis of phloem sap using DIP-APCI-Q-TOF-MS enabled the detection of twelve components of maize phloem sap and twenty components of rapeseed phloem sap and the deduction of possible molecular formulae from the accurate m/z-values detected. By means of DIP-APCI-Ion Trap-MS, MS/MS-experiments were performed to elucidate the structures of the components detected in phloem sap. Due to the low molecular weight of substances detected in phloem sap as well as low signal intensities and nonspecific fragmentation it was only possible to identify the amino acids valine and leucine, which are known to be contained in phloem sap, by comparative analysis of their respective standards...|$|R
