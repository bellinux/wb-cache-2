40|$|Cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, plaice, sole and Norway lobster are 7 main {{target species}} of the {{demersal}} mixed fisheries in the North Sea, Skagerrak and Eastern Channel. Gadoids and Norway lobsters are mainly taken in the nor-thern North Sea by towed <b>gears</b> except <b>beam</b> trawls while the flatfish fisheries are conducted in the southern North Sea mainly using beam trawls. Recently, the central North Sea appears less fished by demersal gears. Towed nets including seines and beam trawls equipped with meshes of more than 100 mm resp. more than 80 mm were identified as the main gears effecting the depleted cod and reduced plaice stocks. The saithe sector, using towed nets with meshes of more than 110 mm, longlines, gill nets and others, appears to affect the 7 species to a lesser extend. These results support the interim effort limitations by gear types, vessel and month as enforced by the European Commission since 2003. TAC regulations alone are considered inefficient to sustainably harvest stocks by mixed fisheries. A fleet-effort management method is developed estimating the fleets’ effects based on the sum of partial exploitation rates of the species in mixed fisheries weighted by {{the ratio of the}} precautionary reference Bpa and the actual SSB size as ecological quality objective.

40|$|Abstract. A {{meaningful}} {{feature of}} the helicopter industry {{compared to the other}} aeronautical industries is the production of transmissions: the essential components for driving the power from the engines to the rotor blades. Transmissions are composed of gears most of which are vital for flight safe; hence gears are requested to be designed and manufactured with a very high quality standard. One of the widely diffused processes to manufacture helicopter <b>gears</b> is electron <b>beam</b> welding (EBW), whose nondestructive testing must assure high sensitivity and defect detection capability, independently by the defect position or orientation in the joint. It was just to answer to this requirement that a special application of the ultrasonic scattering (“delta ” technique) has been introduced, starting from the early seventies, in the automatic scanning inspection of welded joints.

40|$|Benthic marie {{systems of}} the Norwegian shelf belong to the most diverse cold water systems on marine shelves. At the same time these systems {{experience}} strong anthropogenic impacts and provide significant services and goods, which calls for a sustainable management based on an ecosystem approach. The MAREANO project (Marine AREA database for NOrwegian coasts and sea areas) aims at addressing the knowledge gaps on the seabed and environment as the base for a sustainable management. Therefore, {{large parts of the}} northern Norwegian shelf have been intensively studied with multibeam echosounder, providing detailed bathymetry data for terrain analysis and backscatter data, which aids sediment interpretation. The area has also been sampled by different biological <b>gears</b> (video, <b>beam</b> trawl, grab, epibenthic sled) to investigate benthic habitat distribution. Species diversity, abundance and biomass have been determined, and secondary production and productivity of macrozoobenthic organisms modeled. Here, we present results from data covering an area of 48 000 km 2 of the Norwegian continental margin between the Lofoten islands and North Cape and from the Norwegian and Barents Sea. The study area stretches from banks on the shelf (80 m depth) to the deep-sea plains (2750 m), and has been samples with 101 stations during seven cruises from 2006 - 2009. This dataset is unique in spatial coverage as it presents for the first time large-scale macrozoobenthic production on the Norwegian continental shelf. We will present spatial distribution of the macrozoobenthic production and productivity, together with an introductory analysis of the connections between different benthic biological characteristics (taxonomic, functional groups) and sediment as well as terrain parameters for benthic landscapes that have been defined for the same area using video analyses.

40|$|Important {{ecosystem}} services and goods such as marine biodiversity, long-term carbon storage and natural food resources for higher trophic level (e. g. for fish, birds, mammals and finally humans) are {{inextricably linked to}} the benthic system. Benthic production and productivity are thus of direct relevance {{for the management of}} commercial fish stocks and other ecosystem functions that benthos provide. The identification of essential feeding habitats, i. e. highly productive areas, in the benthos are therefore of commercial interest and consecutively also for a marine ecological management. The MAREANO project (Marine AREA database for NOrwegian coasts and sea areas) studies both the seabed environment and the benthic invertebrates, hitherto covering an area of 107 000 km² in the Barents and Norwegian Seas. The dataset may form a platform of benthic knowledge for an ecosystem-based sustainable management of these offshore waters. Hence, MAREANO links the environmental parameters to the benthic ecosystem in order to map the environment and fauna off the Norwegian coast. The area studied first by MAREANO was the Tromsøflaket bank in the Barents Sea (approx. 16 km 2, 150 – 200 m depth) which served as a case-study area. Multibeam echosounder data which provide a basis for terrain analysis were combined with sampling with several biological sampling <b>gears</b> (video, <b>beam</b> trawl, grab and epibenthic sled) in order to analyse and map benthic habitat distribution. Based on the combined analysis, six different benthic biotopes were characterised for Tromsøflaket. The benthic production and productivity showed significant differences between biotopes and strong correlation with environmental parameters, i. e. terrain parameters from multibeam echosounder analysis, sediment type and trawl tracks. Production differences were also found between taxonomic groups and feeding guilds between biotopes.

40|$|Assessing {{cumulative}} {{impacts of}} multiple {{pressures on the}} marine environment can help inform management response. This requires understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of human pressures and their impacts. Quantifying seabed recovery rates from 2 significant pressures in European waters, benthic fishing and aggregate extraction, is a significant step towards assessing sensitivity and cumulative impacts. Vessel monitoring system data were used to estimate the distribution and intensity of benthic fishing in UK (England and Wales) marine waters (2006 to 2007). Data were separated by towed bottom-fishing <b>gears</b> (scallop dredges, <b>beam</b> and otter trawls) and linked to habitat in a geographic information system. Recovery periods of seabed habitats were estimated by literature review, for gear types and fishing intensity. Recovery rates generally increased with sediment hardness, and habitats required longer periods of recovery from scallop dredging than from otter or beam trawling. Fishing pressure across the habitat-gear combinations was such that 80 % of the bottom-fished area {{was estimated to be}} able to recover completely before repeat trawling, based on mean annual trawl frequencies. However, in 19 % of the UK's bottomfished seabed, scallop dredging in sand and gravel and otter trawling in muddy sand and reef habitats occurred at frequencies that prevented full habitat recovery.

A total of 39, 676 fish and crustaceans representing 42 species was caught. The catch rates of nekton were 1. 4 - 68. 1 times higher at night than in the day for 8 of the 17 common species, and were 1. 4 - 9. 2 times higher in seines than trawls for 11 of the common species. None of the common species had higher catch rates in the day than the night, or in the trawls than the seines. For some species {{there was no significant}} difference in catch rates amongst the sampling combinations. Night-time seine collections had a greater proportion of larger individuals than day and trawl samples. The differences in catch rates and size of nekton are probably a consequence of both gear avoidance and the movement of nekton out of seagrass during the day. Catch rates {{were estimated}} more accurately and precisely with the seine than the trawl, with higher catch rates at night. An analysis of the overall composition of the catch (based on presence/absence data) by multi-dimensional scaling separated the samples into four main groups: day-trawl, night-trawl, day-seine and night-seine. The results suggest that seine nets are a better choice for determining the relative proportion of species in a seagrass habitat, and estimating the density of most species. Such sampling should also be done by day and night, or by night alone. Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EnvironmentNo Full Tex...|$|R

This paper is an attempt to contribute to the knowledge of one member of the group, and it is hoped that it may be of some value to intelligent management of the fishery in the future. The specimens of starry flounder for this study were taken during the last four months of 1946 and throughout the years 1947 and 1948 from the waters of Elkhorn Slough, the mouth of the Salinas River and at various localities in Monterey Bay. In Elkhorn Slough the fish were caught in a bobbinet seine 255 cm. long and 94 cm. deep, with hexagonal meshes of 3 mm. diameter. At the mouth of the Salinas River a minnow seine was used for monthly collections made from September, 1946, to February, 1947. This net measured 3 m. long, 1 1 / 4 m. deep, and had meshes 12 mm. in length.

In an overall catch of 8 747 specimens, 53 species were found, the most numerous being Diplodus annularis (1 493), Serranus scriba (1 326), Symphodus rostratus (1 156) and Symphodus cinereus (665). The nocturnal catches, compared with the diurnal, were more abundant, with a higher number of species and specimens. En este estudio se pretende describir la comunidad de peces de Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile, 1813 y detectar el efecto producido por el periodo del día considerando diferentes escalas espaciales. Posidonia oceanica se encuentra desde la superficie hasta los 30 o 40 metros de profundidad, en función de la transparencia del agua.

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyThis thesis work is {{performed}} {{to study and}} understand the pipeline global response {{as a result of}} trawl gears pull-over loads triggering lateral buckling on high temperature/high pressure subsea pipeline. The external interference from trawl gears pull-over loads may create substantial imperfection or out-of-straightness on the pipeline to trigger lateral buckling. The pull-over loads also may induce excessive bending moments and strains in the buckle region. To be able to understand the global response of the pipeline under pull-over loading condition, a finite element analysis is carried out based on DNV OS F 101 [1], DNV RP F 110 [2] and DNV RP F 111 [1]. The analysis is carried out using general finite element analysis software ANSYS v 13. Nonlinear-transient analysis is used to incorporate the non-linear effects, such as the nonlinearities of pipeline material, and the response of a structure under the action of pull-over time-dependent loads. The finite element analysis covers two period of duration i. e. during pull-over loads duration and after pull-over loads duration. The analysis during pull-over loads duration deals with the pipeline global response as a result of trawl gears pull-over loads. The pipeline is subjected to substantial horizontal and vertical pull-over forces from the trawl gears. The pull-over forces are applied based on force-time history as recommended in DNV RP F 111 [3]. This thesis work also study the pipeline post buckling condition. After pull-over loads duration, the pipeline global response may be different. The analysis is carried out for additional 5 seconds from the end of pull-over loads duration. In this period, the pull-over loads are no longer applied. The pipeline may expand further more caused by temperature and pressure loads on pipeline. There are four (4) types of trawl gear considered in the analysis i. e. polyvalent and rectangular trawl <b>gear,</b> industrial v-board, <b>beam</b> trawl and clump weight. All the trawl gears data are taken from DNV RP F 111 [3]. The thesis work calculates the pull-over loads and durations from all type of trawl gears. In the finite element analysis, only the pull-over loads from polyvalent and rectangular trawl gear are used as this is considered to adequately represent the cases. The finite element analysis of trawl gear pull-over shows the trawl gears pull-over loads induces lateral buckling on pipeline. The pipeline deform laterally at the pull-over loads location. High bending moments and strain occur at the apex of the buckle. The DNV displacement condition code check shows that the integrity of the pipeline is not satisfy the safety level hence the pipeline cannot withstand the trawl gears pull-over loads. The analysis with variation of operating temperature and pressure should be carried out as further works. The further works shall also take into account a full comparison of lateral and axial soil friction combination. This way, a more accurate result can be obtained and better conclusion can be verified...|$|R
40|$|The Alboran Sea display complex oceanographic, geological, {{ecological}} and biological processes, promoting a high biodiversity and complexity (Robles, 2010). On the other hand, molluscs constitute {{one of the}} most diverse and best represented invertebrate groups in this area, representing an important component of soft bottom communities, as well as the second group in abundance and biomass in demersal fisheries, with species of {{ecological and}} commercial importance worldwide (Gofas et all., 2011). The study of the molluscan assemblages is important where trawling fishing fleets operate, in order to improve fisheries assessment and move forward to an ecosystem based approach, which takes into account other components of the fishery than the target species such as non-target and protected species and habitats (Pikitch et al., 2004). Information collected on fisheries assemblages may introduce a bias depending on the fraction of the assemblage (e. g. demersal, epifaunal, infaunal) at which the sampling method is targeted, particularly in a group such as molluscs with a high variability in life strategies. The aims of this study are 1) to increase the scarce knowledge on the composition and structure of molluscan assemblages of circalittoral and bathyal soft bottoms of the Alboran Sea; and 2) to compare the information obtained on these assemblages by using two different types of sampling <b>gears,</b> the <b>beam</b> trawl and the otter trawl. During the MEDITS trawl surveys (springs 2014 and 2015) a beam trawl (BT) (horizontal opening 1. 3 x vertical opening 1. 2 m, mesh size 10 mm) and an otter trawl (OT) (GOC 73) (2. 5 x 21. 5 m, mesh size 20 mm) were used in 35 sampling stations at depths from 40 to 800 m in the Alboran Sea. Catches were sorted to species and their individuals counted and weighed. The molluscan assemblages and species were characterized according to their dominance (%Da) and frequency of occurrence (%F). Multivariate analyses using the Bray-Curtis index were performed with presence/absence species data and quantitative data obtained with each method were standardized to a similar sampling area. ANOSIM was used for testing the differences between groups of samples according to different factors (depth and sampling type) and SIMPER for the contribution of the different species to these factors using PRIMER v 6. The characterization of the different types of sampling and assemblages was done with the species richness and statistical differences tested with Kruskal-Wallis using SPSS software. A total of 170 spp. have been collected, with 69 species collected in OT samples, mostly cephalopods (26 spp., 37. 68 %), followed by gastropods (25 spp., 36. 23 %) and bivalves (18 species, 26. 10 % total species of OT), being the latter the most abundant group. The top-dominant species were the bivalve Neopycnodonte cochlear and the cephalopod Alloteuthis media, whereas the most frequent ones were the cephalopods Octopus vulgaris, Todarodes sagittatus and Illex coindetii (Fig. 1). In beam trawl samples, 135 spp. of 6 classes were found, being gastropods the most diverse and abundant one (69 spp., 51. 11 % total species of BT), followed by bivalves (49 spp., 36. 3 %) and cephalopods (15 spp., 11. 11 %). The top-dominant species were the gastropods Turritella communis and Nassarius ovoideus and the bivalves Nucula sulcata and Abra longicallus, and the most frequent ones included Nucula sulcata, Nassarius ovoideus and the gastropod Euspira fusca (Figure 1). Contrasting both methods, only 20 % (34 spp.) of the species were exclusively collected in OT samples (e. g. Alloteuthis spp., I. coindetii, Loligo spp., T. sagittatus) and 57 % (97 spp.) in BT samples (e. g. N. ovoideus, Timoclea ovata, N. sulcata, Clelandella miliaris). Only 23 % of the species (39 spp.) were collected with both methods (e. g. Venus nux, Turritella communis, N. cochlear). Figure 1. Some common and dominant mollusc of beam trawl (A-C, E-G) and otter trawl samples (D, H-J) collected in circalittoral and bathyal soft bottoms of the northern Alboran Sea.

Multivariate analyses clearly separated two groups of samples, each one collected with a different sampling method, and in each grouping it revealed three main mollusks assemblages in relation to depth: I) Continental shelf (CS) (40 - 200 m), II) Upper slope (UCS) (201 - 400 m), and III) and Middle slope (MCS) (400 - 1800 m) (Fig. 2). Figure 2. MDS applied to presence-absence data of molluscs assemblages obtained from beam trawl and otter trawl samples collected in the northern Alboran Sea. BT: Beam trawl; OT: Otter trawl; CS: Continental Shelf; UCS: Upper Continental Slope; MCS: Middle Continental Slope. The continental shelf assemblage in BT samples were characterized by T. ovata, N. cochlear, N. ovoideus and T. communis, whereas O. vulgaris, Eledone moschata and I. coindetii characterized the OT samples. For the upper and middle slope assemblages, E. fusca and A. longicallus characterized the BT samples, whereas T. sagittatus and Bathypolypus sponsalis characterized the OT samples. Mean values of species richness were significantly higher when using the BT. This study showed that OT nor BT samples can provide complete information on the whole molluscan assemblage, giving each sampling method complimentary information. The demersal and epi-benthic fractions of the community were better sampled using the otter trawl and the beam trawl, respectively. The estimates of infauna were higher using the beam trawl, but this information should be contrasted with data obtained from dredges in order to assess whether the beam trawl yield acceptable estimates of the abundance of these molluscs...|$|R
