5|$|Benzodiazepines share {{a similar}} {{chemical}} structure, {{and their effects}} in humans are mainly produced by the allosteric modification of a specific kind of neurotransmitter receptor, the GABAA receptor, which increases the overall conductance of these inhibitory channels; this results in the various therapeutic <b>effects</b> <b>as</b> well as adverse effects of benzodiazepines. Other less important mechanisms of action are also known.|$|E

5|$|Aarhus is in {{the humid}} {{continental}} climate zone (Köppen: Dfb) and the weather is influenced by low-pressure systems from the Atlantic which result in unstable conditions throughout the year. Temperature varies a great deal across the seasons with a mild spring in April and May, warmer summer months from June to August, frequently rainy and windy autumn months in October and September and cooler winter months, often with snow and frost, from December to March. The city centre experiences the same climatic <b>effects</b> <b>as</b> other larger cities with higher wind speeds, more fog, less precipitation and higher temperatures than the surrounding, open land.|$|E
5|$|Any time deep {{focus was}} impossible—as {{in the scene}} in which Kane {{finishes}} a negative review of Susan's opera {{while at the same}} time firing the person who began writing the review—an optical printer was used to make the whole screen appear in focus, visually layering one piece of film onto another. However, some apparently deep-focus shots were the result of in-camera <b>effects,</b> <b>as</b> in the famous scene in which Kane breaks into Susan's room after her suicide attempt. In the background, Kane and another man break into the room, while simultaneously the medicine bottle and a glass with a spoon in it are in closeup in the foreground. The shot was an in-camera matte shot. The foreground was shot first, with the background dark. Then the background was lit, the foreground darkened, the film rewound, and the scene re-shot with the background action.|$|E

5|$|If a photon {{did have}} non-zero mass, {{there would be}} other <b>effects</b> <b>as</b> well. Coulomb's law would be {{modified}} and the electromagnetic field would have an extra physical degree of freedom. These effects yield more sensitive experimental probes of the photon mass than the frequency dependence {{of the speed of}} light. If Coulomb's law is not exactly valid, then that would allow the presence of an electric field to exist within a hollow conductor when it is subjected to an external electric field. This thus allows one to test Coulomb's law to very high precision. A null result of such an experiment has set a limit of m ≲ 10−14eV/c2.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} case, acetic acid reacts with the calcium {{carbonate}} (one {{of the main}} components of freshwater, marine and land shells, birds' eggs and other such specimens) producing calcium acetate, a salt. Formaldehyde can be oxidized by the oxygen in air to create formic acid, which then has basically the same <b>effects</b> <b>as</b> acetic acid, reacting with calcium carbonate to produce a salt. The salts (calcium acetate and calcium formate) crystallize through the specimen's outer surface, destroying its fine detail and exposing more areas for further reaction. As the condition progresses, the salt crystals build up over the specimen's surface, which becomes increasingly eroded.|$|E

5|$|Modern Warfare Remastered builds {{upon the}} {{original}} by featuring extensive graphical and rendering enhancements, lighting upgrades, updated animations, remastering original sound <b>effects</b> <b>as</b> well as adding new, and offers numerous small improvements while retaining the original core gameplay. Extras {{such as new}} multiplayer content and additional achievements and cheats are also included. The game received positive reviews from critics, who lauded the improved graphics, sound, and range of amendments from the original game, {{to the point that}} some found it more akin to a remake. Criticism focused on its dated narrative and AI, with split opinions given to aspects that were seen as both dated and refreshingly simplistic. Activision also generated controversy for not initially releasing Remastered as a standalone game, among other criticized business decisions centered around additional content.|$|E
5|$|Observational {{astronomy}} uses lensing <b>effects</b> <b>as</b> {{an important}} tool to infer properties of the lensing object. Even in cases where that object is not directly visible, {{the shape of a}} lensed image provides information about the mass distribution responsible for the light deflection. In particular, gravitational lensing provides one way to measure the distribution of dark matter, which does not give off light and can be observed only by its gravitational effects. One particularly interesting application are large-scale observations, where the lensing masses are spread out over a significant fraction of the observable universe, and can be used to obtain information about the large-scale properties and evolution of our cosmos.|$|E

5|$|Stern shot Changeling in {{anamorphic}} format on {{35mm film}} using Kodak Vision 500T 5279 film stock. The film was shot on Panavision cameras and C-Series lenses. Due {{to the large}} number of sets, the lighting rigs were more extensive than on other Eastwood productions. The crew made several ceilings from bleached muslin tiles. Stern lit the tiles from above to produce a soft, warm light that was intended to evoke the period through tones close to antique and sepia. The crew segregated the tiles using fire safety fabric Duvatyn to prevent light spilling onto neighboring clusters. The key light was generally softer to match the warm tones given off by the toplights. Stern used stronger skypans—more intense than is commonly used for key lighting—to reduce contrasts when applying daytime rain <b>effects,</b> <b>as</b> a single light source tended to produce harder shadows.|$|E
5|$|Terra Nova {{has been}} cited {{as one of the}} first squad-oriented games with {{three-dimensional}} (3D) graphics; the player is often assisted by artificially intelligent teammates who may be given tactical commands. Conceived by Looking Glass after the completion of their first game, , Terra Nova was subject to a long and difficult development process, caused in part by the production of its full motion video cutscenes. The game's TED engine can render 3D outdoor environments and simulate physics; the latter enables such <b>effects</b> <b>as</b> procedural animation.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Sleepy Hollows 150 visual effects shots were handled by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), while Kevin Yagher supervised {{the human and}} creature effects.

Ray Park, who served as the Headless Horseman stunt double, wore a blue ski mask for the chroma key effect, digitally removed by ILM.
