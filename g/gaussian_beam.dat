40|$|International audienceGaussian beams {{techniques}} are high-frequency asymptotic methods {{that can be}} used to model the propagation/interaction of fields in a variety of problems. In this article, an expansion is proposed to express the scattering of magnetic/electric currents from a curved interface in terms of a new kind of elementary <b>beams,</b> the conformal <b>Gaussian</b> <b>beams.</b> The expansion characteristics rely on the physical properties of the configuration, which leads to represent the scattering with a small number of conformal <b>Gaussian</b> <b>beams.</b> An analytical formulation for the conformal <b>Gaussian</b> <b>beams</b> is developed, which expression is derived from an asymptotic evaluation of the radiation integrals valid at great distance from the interface. An example is presented to show that this analytical formulation is in good agreement with the reference result. Numerical tests are led on the expansion in order to show that the scattering can be represented with accuracy by adding the contribution of conformal <b>Gaussian</b> <b>beams...</b>|$|R

This paper describes how a focused beam system is {{used to determine the}} scattering characteristics of an arbitrary-shaped cylinder. The fields of the transmitting and receiving antennas, as well as the scattered field from the cylinder, are described by equivalent fundamental <b>Gaussian</b> <b>beams.</b> An analytical procedure based on the computation of the coupling between the <b>Gaussian</b> <b>beams</b> in the focused beam system is used to determine the IFR of the cylinder.

25|$|The {{rotation}} of the beam inside the cavity alters the polarization state of the beam. To compensate for this, a single pass delay line is also needed, made of either a three or two mirrors in a 3d respective 2d retro-reflection configuration {{on top of a}} linear stage. To adjust for beam divergence a second car on the linear stage with two lenses can be used. The two lenses act as a telescope producing a flat phase front of a <b>Gaussian</b> <b>beam</b> on a virtual end mirror.|$|E
25|$|Most optical traps {{operate with}} a <b>Gaussian</b> <b>beam</b> (TEM00 mode) profile intensity. In this case, if the {{particle}} is displaced {{from the center}} of the beam, as in the right part of the figure, the particle has a net force returning it to the center of the trap because more intense beams impart a larger momentum change towards the center of the trap than less intense beams, which impart a smaller momentum change away from the trap center. The net momentum change, or force, returns the particle to the trap center.|$|E
25|$|The way {{in which}} the beam profile of a laser beam changes as it propagates is {{determined}} by diffraction. When the entire emitted beam has a planar, spatially coherent wave front, it approximates <b>Gaussian</b> <b>beam</b> profile and has the lowest divergence for a given diameter. The smaller the output beam, the quicker it diverges. It is possible to reduce the divergence of a laser beam by first expanding it with one convex lens, and then collimating it with a second convex lens whose focal point is coincident with that of the first lens. The resulting beam has a larger diameter, and hence a lower divergence.|$|E

40|$|<b>Gaussian</b> <b>beams</b> {{describe}} the amplitude and phase of rays and {{are widely used}} to model acoustic propagation. This paper describes four new results {{in the theory of}} <b>Gaussian</b> <b>beams.</b> (1) A new version of the Červený equations for the amplitude and phase of <b>Gaussian</b> <b>beams</b> is developed by applying the equivalence of Hamilton [...] Jacobi theory with Jacobi's equation that connects Riemannian curvature to geodesic flow. Thus the paper makes a fundamental connection between <b>Gaussian</b> <b>beams</b> and an acoustic channel's so-called intrinsic Gaussian curvature from differential geometry. (2) A new formula π([c over c'']) [superscript 1 over 2] for the distance between convergence zones is derived and applied to the Munk and other well-known profiles. (3) A class of “model spaces” are introduced that connect the acoustics of ducting/divergence zones with the channel's Gaussian curvature K = cc''-(c') [superscript 2]. The model sound speed profiles (SSPs) yield constant Gaussian curvature in which the geometry of ducts corresponds to great circles on a sphere and convergence zones correspond to antipodes. The distance between caustics π([c over c'']) [superscript 1 over 2] is equated with an ideal hyperbolic cosine SSP duct. (4) An intrinsic version of Červený's formulae for the amplitude and phase of <b>Gaussian</b> <b>beams</b> is derived that does not depend on an extrinsic, arbitrary choice of coordinates such as range and depth. Direct comparisons are made between the computational frameworks used by the three different approaches to Gaussian beams: Snell's law, the extrinsic Frenet [...] Serret formulae, and the intrinsic Jacobi methods presented here. The relationship of <b>Gaussian</b> <b>beams</b> to Riemannian curvature is explained with an overview of the modern covariant geometric methods that provide a general framework for application to other special cases.

40|$|Various {{families}} of <b>Gaussian</b> <b>beams</b> have been explored previously {{to represent the}} propagation of nearly plane electromagnetic waves in media having at most quadratic transverse variations of the index of refraction and the gain or loss {{in the vicinity of}} the beam. However, such beams cannot directly represent the wave solutions for propagation in planar or rectangular waveguides, and sinusoidal mode functions are more commonly used for such waveguides. On the other hand, it is also useful to consider the possibility of recurring <b>Gaussian</b> <b>beams</b> that have an approximately Gaussian transverse profile at certain distinct planes along the propagation path. It is shown here that under some conditions recurring <b>Gaussian</b> <b>beams</b> can describe wave propagation in hollow metal waveguides, and they can also lead to efficient coupling between the waveguide fields and free-space beams...|$|R
25|$|The group {{velocity}} {{of a wave}} (e.g., a light beam) may also exceed c in some circumstances. In such cases, which typically {{at the same time}} involve rapid attenuation of the intensity, the maximum of the envelope of a pulse may travel with a velocity above c. However, even this situation does not imply the propagation of signals with a velocity above c, even though one may be tempted to associate pulse maxima with signals. The latter association {{has been shown to be}} misleading, because the information on the arrival of a pulse can be obtained before the pulse maximum arrives. For example, if some mechanism allows the full transmission of the leading part of a pulse while strongly attenuating the pulse maximum and everything behind (distortion), the pulse maximum is effectively shifted forward in time, while the information on the pulse does not come faster than c without this effect. However, {{group velocity}} can exceed c in some parts of a <b>Gaussian</b> <b>beam</b> in vacuum (without attenuation). The diffraction causes that the peak of pulse propagates faster, while overall power does not.|$|E

The ratio of the BPP of the real beam to that of an ideal <b>Gaussian</b> <b>beam</b> at the same wavelength is known as M2 ("M squared"). The M2 for a <b>Gaussian</b> <b>beam</b> is one.

40|$|International audienceFor the {{development}} of millimeter wave imaging systems, {{it is important to}} be able to simulate some representative scattering configurations. Typically, <b>Gaussian</b> <b>beams</b> are used in active imaging systems. Since these beams only illuminate a spatially limited region, many objects can be treated as infinitely long 2 D (in) homogenous cylinders. However, the incident <b>Gaussian</b> <b>beams</b> have a 3 D character. Therefore, a dedicated 2. 5 D scattering simulator was developed. In this paper, simulation results obtained with this simulator are compared to measurements obtained from a bi-static microwave set-up and from a W-band millimeter wave set-up.

When such a beam is refocused by a lens, the transverse phase dependence is altered; {{this results in a}} different <b>Gaussian</b> <b>beam.</b> The electric and magnetic field amplitude profiles along any such circular <b>Gaussian</b> <b>beam</b> (for a given wavelength and polarization) are determined by a single parameter: the so-called [...] waist w0.
