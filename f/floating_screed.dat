25|$|Depending on the {{temperature}} {{at which it}} is applied, asphalt is categorized as hot mix, warm mix, or cold mix. Hot mix asphalt is applied at temperatures over 300°F (150°C) with a free <b>floating</b> <b>screed.</b> Warm mix asphalt is applied at temperatures of 200–250°F (95–120°C), resulting in reduced energy usage and emissions of volatile organic compounds. Cold mix asphalt is often used on lower-volume rural roads, where hot mix asphalt would cool {{too much on the}} long trip from the asphalt plant to the construction site.|$|E
50|$|This {{sense of}} screed has been {{extended}} to asphalt paving where a free <b>floating</b> <b>screed</b> {{is part of a}} machine which spreads the pavement.|$|E
50|$|The free <b>floating</b> <b>screed</b> has {{a number}} of forces acting on it that, when in equilibrium, allow the depth behind the screed to be constant.|$|E
5000|$|To meet modern {{standards}} (both hollow-core {{and massive}} slab) of soundproofing the floor {{needs to be}} covered with a soft floor covering that is able to dampen the sound of footsteps or a <b>floating</b> floor <b>screed</b> should be installed. An alternative is to put a strip of rubber underneath the floor slabs [...]|$|R
5000|$|The asphalt paver was {{developed}} by Barber Greene Co., that originally manufactured material handling systems. In 1929 the Chicago Testing Laboratory approached them to use their material loaders to construct asphalt roads. This {{did not result in}} a partnership but Barber Greene did develop a machine based on the concrete pavers of the day that mixed and placed the concrete in a single process. This setup did not prove as effective as desired and the processes were separated and the modern paver was on its way.In 1933 the independent <b>float</b> <b>screed</b> was invented and when combined with the tamper bar provided for uniform material density and thickness. Harry Barber filed for a patent a [...] "Machine for and process of laying roads" [...] on 10 April 1936 and received patent [...] on 6 December 1938. The main features of the paver developed by Barber Greene Co. have been incorporated into most pavers since, although improvements have been made to control of the machine.|$|R
50|$|The company Barber Greene {{dominated}} {{the market for}} free <b>floating</b> <b>screed</b> equipment until the patent expired in 1955, and now all major asphalt paver manufacturers use this design principle in their equipment.|$|E
50|$|The free <b>floating</b> <b>screed</b> is {{a device}} pioneered in the 1930s that {{revolutionized}} the asphalt paving process.The device {{is designed to}} flatten the material (e.g. concrete or asphalt) below it, which {{is also known as}} screed.|$|E
50|$|The early pavers used screw conveyers to {{distribute}} the mix {{in front of a}} screed that tamped the mix. This process meant that the asphalt was suitable for coarse-graded mixes, however on dense-graded mixes that were common on city streets the machine experienced problems including surface imperfections. In 1933, Barber's son Ashley (Ash) joined the company and in the same year the independent <b>floating</b> <b>screed</b> was developed. This screed along with the tamper bar that permitted uniform material density of the finished surface were the two key features that allowed the machine to become successful. Early pavers had a hopper which material was dumped into and spread by an auger. The <b>floating</b> <b>screed</b> was supported by runners that traveled on the prepared base material.|$|E
5000|$|The free <b>floating</b> <b>screed</b> {{has become}} {{standard}} {{because of the}} smoothing or averaging effect it can have on the existing base course. Since the only connection between the asphalt paver and the screed is the tow arm, the screed can [...] "float" [...] vertically relative to the paver. This allows the paver to traverse uneven ground while the screed floats over the material {{placed in front of}} it.|$|E
50|$|The paver {{should provide}} a smooth uniform surface behind the screed. In order to provide a smooth surface a free <b>floating</b> <b>screed</b> is used. It is towed {{at the end of}} a long arm which reduces the base {{topology}} effect on the final surface. The height of the screed is controlled by a number of factors including the attack angle of the screed, weight and vibration of the screed, the material head and the towing force.|$|E
50|$|Depending on the {{temperature}} {{at which it}} is applied, asphalt is categorized as hot mix, warm mix, or cold mix. Hot mix asphalt is applied at temperatures over 300 °F (150 °C) with a free <b>floating</b> <b>screed.</b> Warm mix asphalt is applied at temperatures of 200-250 °F (95-120 °C), resulting in reduced energy usage and emissions of volatile organic compounds. Cold mix asphalt is often used on lower-volume rural roads, where hot mix asphalt would cool {{too much on the}} long trip from the asphalt plant to the construction site.|$|E
50|$|Screed {{has three}} {{meanings}} in building construction. 1) a flat board (screed board, <b>floating</b> <b>screed)</b> or a purpose-made aluminium tool used to smooth and true materials like concrete, stucco and plaster {{after it has}} been placed on a surface or to assist in flattening; 2) a strip of plaster or wood applied to a surface to act as a guide for a screed tool (screed rail, screed strip, screed batten); 3) the material itself which has been flattened with a screed (screed coat). In the UK, screed has also come to describe a thin, top layer of material (traditionally sand and cement), poured in site on top of the structural concrete or insulation, on top of which other finishing materials can be applied, or it can be left bare to achieve a raw effect.|$|E
40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} that the footfall sound attenuation in timber floor constructions can be considerably improved by subdividing the <b>floating</b> <b>screed</b> into small floor spaces. Covering the screed with fibrous plaster plates and an additional carpet results in a footfall sound attenuation of 18 bB, fitting thus the increased demands of DIN 4109 SIGLEAvailable from TIB Hannover: RN 5905 (2529) : RR 3055 (1992, 1) / FIZ - Fachinformationszzentrum Karlsruhe / TIB - Technische InformationsbibliothekBundesministerium fuer Raumordnung, Bauwesen und Staedtebau, Bonn (Germany) DEGerman...|$|E
