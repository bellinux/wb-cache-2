40|$|The present article {{reports on}} a study {{investigating}} the interaction of a reading comprehension test with gender in a formal testing context {{and the performance of}} males and females on reading test items with regard to demands on strategy use. Participants were 187 (59 =female and 128 =male) international students ranging from 17 to 20 years of age studying English at the intermediate level, at The School of Foreign Languages in North Cyprus. Three reading comprehension passages with 25 questions were given to the participants as the final exam of the course. Two of the texts according to Bügel and Buunk’s (1996) classification had male topics and one had a neutral topic. The questions on these passages tapped different information and each question required the students to interact with the reading passages in a different way. The questions given to students were classified into 6 categories: identifying main idea, reading for specific information, guessing meaning from context, <b>identifying</b> referential <b>information,</b> matching <b>titles</b> with paragraph, and text coherence. The findings of the study suggest that males and females perform differently on different items. Females scored higher on identifying main idea, guessing meaning from context, and text coherence questions. Conversely, males outperformed females in reading for specific <b>information,</b> <b>identifying</b> referential <b>information,</b> and matching <b>titles</b> with paragraph. However, gender affected item performance in only two cases: guessing meaning from context, and text coherence in favor of the females. Nonetheless, the overall performance of males and females on the reading test was not significantly different which implies that text topic did not influence male and female performance on the reading comprehension test. The article discusses the findings and explores classroom implications...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a computerized system designed and {{developed for the}} purpose of simplifying and improving scoring and summarizing the achievement of students participating in Title I programs. The goal of the evaluation and reporting system is to provide meaningful and comparable <b>information</b> about <b>Title</b> I projects at the school building, school district, state, and federal levels. The data are reported from each Title I project. These data are entered on coding sheets and show <b>identifying</b> <b>information</b> for the school district, the building, and each student within the building. Developed originally for use in Iowa, the system is presently being used in some form in four states. Local districts report raw scores to the State Department of Education, along with proper test identification. The system enters raw scores and other <b>identifying</b> <b>information</b> and produces summary reports by school building and district. It also gives a diagnosis of selected evaluation procedures and what percent of students were affected if improper procedures were used. The system has both reduced the reporting burden for local districts and increased the accuracy of the aggregated state reports.

40|$|Abstract When {{the names}} of child victims and other <b>identifying</b> <b>information</b> appear in the media it can {{exacerbate}} trauma, complicate recovery, discourage future disclosures and inhibit cooperation with authorities for the children involved. In this study, we evaluated the amount of <b>identifying</b> <b>information</b> available in a systematic sample of 561 newspaper articles about non-fatal child victimizations published from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2004. <b>Identifying</b> <b>information</b> about the victim (e. g. name of the child 2 ̆ 7 s street, school or a family member 2 ̆ 7 s full name) was published in 51 percent of articles covering child victimizations. For cases of sexual assault, victim identifiers {{were most likely to}} be included when the alleged offender was related to the victim or was a high-profile community member. Based on these findings, we examine the arguments for and against more restrictive policies regarding <b>identifying</b> <b>information,</b> and suggest some guidelines that would provide additional protections for child victims...|$|R
