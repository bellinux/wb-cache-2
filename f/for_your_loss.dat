I'd like to let you all know, despite the situation – I know {{all of you are}} still convinced that I'm the person that killed your father, your son and your brother, but I am innocent. The incident that happened that night was not my fault. I did not have a gun that night. I did not shoot your family member. But I am so sorry <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>loss.</b> I really am – sincerely. All I can ask is that each of you look deeper into this case, so that you really will finally see the truth. I ask my family and friends that you all continue to pray, that you all continue to forgive. Continue to fight this fight. For those about to take my life, may God have mercy on all of your souls. God bless you all. He was declared dead at 11:08pm EDT.|$|E

2500|$|At a press conference, Deputy Chief Constable Doug LePard of the VPD {{apologized to}} the victims' families, saying [...] "I wish {{from the bottom of}} my heart that we would have caught him sooner. I wish that, the several {{agencies}} involved, that we could have done better in so many ways. I wish that all the mistakes that were made, we could undo. And I wish that more lives would have been saved. So on my behalf and behalf of the Vancouver Police Department and all the men and women that worked on this investigation, I would say to the families how sorry we all are <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>losses</b> and because we did not catch this monster sooner." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{am right}} {{glad that you}} have escaped, Sancho. Firstly, because every stout arm is sorely needed. Secondly, because Marina has grieved much <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>loss.</b> Truly, had you been her brother {{she could not have}} been more affected. She is in the center of the column. You had best tarry here until she comes along, and then join her. She will be rejoiced to see you again." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was Mr. Bar. When she saw him, Mrs. Breadbasket stepped {{suddenly}} {{back into}} the parlor with my ladies. [...] "What is it, Mr. Bar?" [...] says I; and as quick as thought, I had the towel under his chin, Mr. Bar in the chair, and the whole of his face in a beautiful foam of lather. Mr. Bar made some resistance.--"Don't think of it, Mr. Cox," [...] says he; [...] "don't trouble yourself, sir." [...] But I lathered away and never minded. [...] "And what's this melancholy event, sir," [...] says I, [...] "that has spread desolation in your family's bosoms? I can feel <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>loss,</b> sir--I can feel for your loss." ...|$|E
3000|$|Mr. Bei: Compensation is {{determined}} by policies. There is no legal basis for it. He can propose five thousand and you can raise it to six thousand <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>losses.</b> The adjustment of property relations is another subject. It has a legal basis. The second item of [...] "The Civil Law" [...] says that it applies to the adjustment of personal and property relations among legal persons and citizens. It is effective among civil subjects, and the state is also a civil subject, and we are both civil subjects. Government exercises authority {{on behalf of the}} state. It can only dispose of its own properties. It cannot dispose of and allocate civilians’ properties. (Field interview on Dec. 14, 2005) [...]...|$|R

"Dear Mr. Bopp, I wish I could heal this sorrow, but as I cannot, let me bear it with you; let me {{tell you}} how we loved the little child, and longed to see her; how we should have rejoiced to know you had so dear a friend to make your life happy in this strange land; how we shall grieve <b>for</b> <b>your</b> great <b>loss,</b> and long to prove our respect and love for you.

Therefore I advise you, when you get to Tunis, to embark in the first ship that sails. If you come to Venice, ask for me, and I will make up to you <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>loss</b> of booty, and put you in the way of leading an honest life again. But before going, you must first change clothes with me. You can sell mine at Tunis for enough to buy you a dozen suits like yours; but you must divide with me what money you now have in your possession, for I cannot start penniless." ...|$|E

Ecod, he saws away at Mozart and Handel {{and the rest of}} the big-wigs like a thorough workman. And you needn't," [...] says Mr. Bucket in a considerate and private voice, [...] "you needn't commit yourself to too low a figure, governor. I don't want to pay too large a price for my friend, but I want you to have your proper percentage and be remunerated <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>loss</b> of time. That is but fair.

I am {{sure that there is}} not a man in the {{regiment}} but would have liked to have given you a cheer as you rode along this morning just before we started. We shall miss you, but as you will be up and down all day and can look in of an evening, it won't be as if you had been put on the staff of another brigade. As to Dicky Ryan, he is altogether down in the mouth, whether it is regret <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>loss</b> or whether it is from jealousy at seeing you capering about on horseback, while he is tramping along on foot, is more than I know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see, I am very, very humble. I {{have put}} my foolish pride [...] underfoot. I am not broken. I am still very proud and, I fear, [...] self-conceited, {{in spite of}} my severe lesson. Enid is beautiful, [...] and I know it, and it helps me write this letter, but I have no [...] right to ask even {{friendship}} from you. My proved failure as a [...] playwright robs me of every chance of meeting you on equal terms. I [...] want to repay you, I must repay you, for what you have done. If I [...] could write now, it would be not to please myself, but to please [...] you, to help you regain your dominion. I want to see you the [...] radiant one again, speaking to throngs of happy people.

But I am helpless. I shall not speak or [...] write to you again till I can come with some gift in my hand--some [...] recompense <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>losses</b> through me. I have been a malign [...] influence in your life. I am in mad despair when I think of you [...] playing to cold and empty houses. I am going back to the West to [...] do sash factories and wheat elevators; these are my métier. You [...] are the one to grant pardon; I am the malefactor.

6000|$|... "I {{have not}} {{time to write}} half I have to say, for my letter must go; [...] but I prefer writing {{in a hurry to}} not writing at all. You can't think [...] how much I feel <b>for</b> <b>your</b> griefs and <b>losses,</b> or how much and {{constantly}} [...] I have thought of you lately. I began a letter to you in Town, but [...] destroyed it, from the fear of appearing troublesome. There are times, [...] I know, when one cannot write with any degree of comfort or [...] satisfaction.

6000|$|Yet {{the child}} {{could make him}} no answer, and sobbed as though her heart were bursting. 'Why would you go, dear Nell? I know {{you would not be}} happy when you heard that we were crying <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>loss.</b> They say that Willy is in Heaven now, and that it's always summer there, and yet I'm sure he grieves when I lie down upon his garden bed, and he cannot turn to kiss me. But if you do go, Nell,' said the boy, caressing her, and {{pressing}} his face to hers, 'be fond of him for my sake. Tell him how I love him still, and how much I loved you; and when I think that you two are together, and are happy, I'll try to bear it, and never give you pain by doing wrong--indeed I never will!' ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{ask myself}} how I {{can write to}} you and yet how I cannot, for my heart is full of the tenderest and most {{compassionate}} thought of you, and I can't but vainly say so. And I feel myself thinking as tenderly of him, and of the laceration of his consciousness of leaving you and his boys, of giving you up and ceasing to be for you what he so devotedly was. And that makes me pity him more than words can say--with the wretchedness of one's not having been able to contribute to help or save him. But there {{he is in his}} sacrifice--a beautiful, noble, stainless memory, without the shadow upon him, or the shadow of a shadow, of a single grossness or meanness or ugliness--the world's dust on the nature of thousands of men. Everything that was high and charming in him comes out as one holds on to him, and when I think of my friendship of so many years with him I see it all as fairness and felicity. And then I think of your admirable years and I find no words <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>loss.</b> I only desire to keep near you and remain more than ever yours, ...|$|E
6000|$|And now {{to thank}} you, my ever-dearest Mrs. Martin, for your kind and welcome {{letter from the}} Lakes. I knew quite at the first page, and long before you said a word specifically, that dear Mr. Martin was better, and think that such a scene, even from under an umbrella, must have done good to the soul and body of both of you. I wish I could have looked through your eyes for once. But I suppose that neither through yours, nor through my own, am I ever likely to behold that sight. In the {{meantime}} it is with considerable satisfaction that I hear of your failure of Wordsworth, which was my salvation in a very awful sense. Why, if you had done such a thing, you would have put me to the shame of too much honor. The speculation consoles me entirely <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>loss</b> in respect to Rydal Hall and its poet. By the way, I heard {{the other day that}} Rogers, who was intending to visit him, said, 'It is a bad time of year for it. The god is on his pedestal; and can only give gestures to his worshippers, and no conversation to his friends.' ...|$|E
5000|$|At Newman's funeral, Javier de Anda, vice {{president}} of B. P.

B.P., we thank God <b>for</b> <b>your</b> presence in our lives." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "During {{the last}} month you have {{fortunately}} {{had so much to}} distract your thoughts that you have not had time to dwell upon <b>your</b> <b>loss.</b> Moreover, you have needed all your strength and <b>your</b> energy <b>for</b> <b>your</b> search <b>for</b> <b>your</b> sister, and right sure am I that your father, who was as sensible as he was wise--and the two things do not always go together--would be far better pleased to see you energetic and active in <b>your</b> search <b>for</b> <b>your</b> sister and in preparation for this new life on which we are entering, than in vain regrets for him; therefore, lad, for every reason I thought it better to keep silent upon the subject. It may be a satisfaction, however, for you to know that everything will be done to do honor to the dead.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} have {{informed}} him at once, Mr. O'Connor," [...] the major said, with an attempt at gravity.

I shall not fail, in reporting the matter, to do you full credit <b>for</b> <b>your</b> share in it. Now, what is <b>your</b> <b>loss,</b> Captain O'Grady?" ...|$|R
50|$|In some states, PIP is subrogatable, {{meaning that}} your {{insurance}} carrier will pay <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>loss,</b> regardless of liability, and then recover (or subrogate) what it paid from the liable party's insurance carrier. This generally leaves the claimant/insured {{in a much}} better financial position, because his or her medical bills are paid, and the insurance carriers get to fight it out on their own, and after the fact.|$|E
5000|$|On 28 June 2010, {{after another}} series of failed EPG downloads, InView responded to {{customer}} enquiries {{with the following}} statement: [...] "Thank you for your email.

40|$|Every big scam {{starts with}} a small invite. You are about to face the {{inconvenient}} accusation of you being responsible <b>for</b> <b>your</b> own <b>loss.</b> At least, {{this was the case}} for the seller of ”Macbook Pro 15 ” 2. 4 intel-core, 4 GB, glossy” in early December 2010. This thesis is breaking apart the comfort zone of being a victim, suggesting we want to be betrayed. Although the ”victim” has detected a risk, his wish to beleive that the affair is what it’s told to be, nourishes the betrayal that can proceed. Cooperation is the key word and a possible explanation to scam or betrayal – spun out of our natural urges fear, vanity and boredom. By rhetorically analysing a mail conversation, consisting of 21 mails sent between a scammer and his prey, the full scamming process can be reveiled. Investigating the nature of convincement and adaptation, it seems we put our trust in trust itself. On the other hand our greed makes us all possible scammers – a matter of the heart for 1920 ‘s essayist Walter Serner, who’s hand book for scammers appears relevant even to this day. Has the truth lost it’s charm? Who’s fooling who? Consider {{that there is no such}} thing as being fooled – only being a fool...|$|R
5000|$|Transformation: {{rethinking}} your {{purpose in}} life and the basis <b>for</b> <b>your</b> identity; looking <b>for</b> meaning in tragic, senseless loss; allowing yourself to have both painful and positive feelings about <b>your</b> <b>loss</b> and become able to choose which feelings you focus on; allowing yourself to discover that your struggle has led you to develop a stronger, better version of yourself than you expected could exist; learning how to talk with others about your heroic healing journey without exposing them to your pain; becoming supportive of others {{trying to deal with}} their losses.|$|R
