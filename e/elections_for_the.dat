5|$|The Prime Minister of Pakistan is the {{political}} leader and head of government of the country, and is responsible for nominating {{the rest of the}} government, chairing Cabinet meetings and deciding when to call general <b>elections</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> National Assembly.

5|$|While the Commission is the {{executive}} branch, the candidates are chosen individually by the 28 national governments, which means {{it is not possible}} for a Commission Member or its President to be removed by a direct election. Rather, the legitimacy of the Commission is mainly drawn from the vote of approval that is required from the European Parliament, along with Parliament's power to dismiss the body, which, in turn, raises the concern of the relatively low turnout (less than 50%) in <b>elections</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> European Parliament since 1999. While that figure may be higher than that of some national elections, including the off-year elections of the United States Congress, {{the fact that there are}} no <b>elections</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> position of Commission President calls the position's legitimacy into question in the eyes of some. The fact that the Commission can directly decide (albeit with oversight from specially formed 'comitology committees') on the shape and character of implementing legislation further raises concerns about democratic legitimacy.|$|E
5|$|According to top Marine officials, the {{elections}} {{were designed to}} help enfranchise the Iraqi government by including Iraqi citizens in its formation. Only 3,775 voters (2 percent of the eligible population) cast ballots in Anbar Province due to a Sunni boycott.

5|$|Although {{they had}} {{considered}} not contesting the election because {{the area was}} a Conservative stronghold, the Liberals decided {{to do so in}} order to generate a discussion on the issue of Home Rule for Ireland. Allsopp was in agreement with the Conservative policy, which was to maintain full governmental control over Ireland, and pass further Coercion Acts to reduce lawlessness in that country. Sanders, who had lost two previous <b>elections</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Liberal Party, was in favour of devolution of powers to Ireland.|$|E

5|$|Despite of the {{internal}} opposition of Fernando de la Rúa, Alfonsín got his party to approve the pact. He reasoned that Menem would be supported by the eventual referendum, that many legislators would turn to his side, and he would eventually be able to amend the constitution reinforcing presidential power rather than limiting it. Still, as both sides feared a betrayal, all {{the contents of the}} pact were included as a single proposal, not allowing the Constituent Assembly to discuss each one separately. The Broad Front, a new political party composed of former Peronists, led by Carlos Álvarez, grew in the <b>elections</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Constituent Assembly. Both the PJ and the UCR respected the pact, which was completely approved. Duhalde made a similar amendment to the constitution of the Buenos Aires province, in order to be re-elected in 1995. Menem won the elections with more than 50% of the vote, followed by José Octavio Bordón, and Carlos Álvarez. The UCR finished third in the <b>elections</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time.|$|E

He attempted to run in the primary <b>elections</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1995 presidential elections against Menem, who was seeking re-election.

He also attempted to run in the primary <b>elections</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1999 presidential elections, and resigned his candidacy again, this time on behalf of Eduardo Duhalde, governor of the Buenos Aires Province. Duhalde lost the elections to the radical Fernando de la Rúa, and Rodríguez Saá was again re-elected as governor. He attempted to divide the city of San Luis into four municipalities, as the mayor was a political rival, but had to drop the project because of the popular unrest generated by the proposal.|$|E
5|$|Houphouët entered electoral {{politics}} in August 1945, when <b>elections</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Abidjan city council were {{held for the}} first time. The French electoral rules established a common roll: half of the elected {{would have to be}} French citizens (who were mostly Europeans) and the other half non-citizens. Houphouët reacted by creating a multi-ethnic all-African roll with both non-citizens and citizens (mostly Senegalese with French citizenship). As a result, most of the African contenders withdrew and a large number of the French protested by abstaining, thus assuring a decisive victory for his African Bloc.|$|E
