40|$|A novel {{polymeric}} {{platform for}} catalyst immobilization has been developed, featuring <b>inverted</b> <b>solubility</b> pattern: soluble in a nonpolar and insoluble in a polar medium. Asymmetric reduction of imines with Cl 3 SiH (see scheme), catalyzed by chiral formamide anchored to this soluble polymer, proceeds under homogeneous conditions to give chiral amines in high yields and enantioselectivities (≤ 91 [*]% ee) ...|$|E
40|$|The P 23 T mutant {{of human}} γD-crystallin (HGD) is {{associated}} with cataract. We have previously investigated the solution properties of this mutant, {{as well as those}} of the closely related P 23 V and P 23 S mutants, and shown that although mutations at site 23 of HGD do not produce a significant structural change in the protein, they nevertheless profoundly alter the solubility of the protein. Remarkably, the solubility of the mutants decreases with increasing temperature, in sharp contrast to the behavior of the native protein. This <b>inverted</b> <b>solubility</b> corresponds to a strong increase in the binding energy with temperature. Here we have investigated the liquid–liquid coexistence curve and the diffusivity of the P 23 V mutant and find that these solution properties are unaffected by the mutation. This means that the chemical potentials in the solution phase are essentially unaltered. The apparent discrepancy between the interaction energies in the solution phase, as compared with the solid phase, is explicable in terms of highly anisotropic interprotein interactions, which are averaged out in the solution phase but are fully engaged in the solid phase...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Fouling of quartz jackets around mercury {{arc lamps}} {{represents}} a performance limitation in photochemical reactors used in treatment of aqueous streams, {{such as those}} used in disinfection, photo-catalysis and UV-based advanced oxidation processes. These fouling materials are generally comprised of inorganic constituents, though {{little is known about}} their specific chemistry. The goal {{of this paper is to}} characterize inorganic fouling on quartz surfaces in photoreactors by evaluation of the composition of fouling materials and chemical analysis of corresponding waters. Results showed that the fouling ma-terials were predominantly amorphous inorganics. Fouling material composition was found to be site-specific. Cation composition in the fouling materials was found to be highly complex, with many metals being common to all samples; in all cases, iron, aluminum and calcium were found to represent the ma-jority of the metals present. Predominant anions included carbonate, sulfate, hydroxide, chloride and phosphate. In the absence of UV radiation and heat from UV lamps, the extent of inorganic fouling was substantially diminished. Thermally-induced precipitation of inorganic species and impaction of preexisting colloidal particles were hypothesized to be the primary mechanisms responsible for inorganic fouling; accumulation of materials due to direct ion exchange reactions with the quartz surfaces was shown to be of negligible importance. # 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.
