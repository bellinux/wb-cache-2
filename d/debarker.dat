30|$|P. jezoensis saplings {{appear to}} be less {{palatable}} for sika deer because no P. jezoensis saplings was <b>debarked</b> and we found marginal effect of species on <b>debarking</b> of trees (Table  3). Generally, Abies species were preferentially <b>debarked</b> over co-occurring Picea species (Heuze et al. 2005), and the different palatability among tree species suggests that deer <b>debarking</b> may alter the species composition of forests. However, P. jezoensis has been heavily <b>debarked</b> in some areas in Japan (Yokoyama et al. 2001; Ando et al. 2003), indicating that palatability of <b>debarking</b> may be affected by surrounding vegetation (Moore et al. 1999; McLaren et al. 2000).

30|$|To {{conclude}} {{the results from}} this study, closely <b>debarked</b> wood (Norway spruce, Scots pine, and Downy birch) gave rise to the least polluted leachates, compared to the other bark/wood treatments. For the spruce, this finding also applied to the gently <b>debarked</b> wood. Additionally, the spruce gave rise to higher concentrations of leached pollutant substances analysed than did the pine and birch. According to the results of this study, using carefully <b>debarked</b> logs for storage and sprinkling is the best method for improving the quality of runoff water. The higher concentrations of pollutants from the gently <b>debarked</b> wood (for the pine and birch) illustrate the importance of the <b>debarking</b> method and the need for proper <b>debarking</b> in practice.

The nasal cavities of many workers, particularly workers in the debarkers, proved to be contaminated by Klebsiella pneumoniae, other coliforms, yeasts, and molds; usually only one microbe was involved, but sometimes two or several species were found. Nasal bacteria and yeasts were largely derived from the mill and <b>debarker</b> air; the microbes in the air came mainly from process waters. Lack of association of nasopharyngeal symptoms with either exposure to aerosols or nasal microbial contamination was interpreted as an indication of host defenses that were adequate to protect workers from harmful microbial colonization in paper mill environments...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT To {{assess the}} {{potential}} use of both softwood and hardwood bark broiler litters as a feedstuff for ruminants, the nutrient composition and in vitro digestibility for both raw and ensiled bark litters were chemically evaluated and compared to softwood planer shavings broiler litter. Each bark type was either processed or used directly {{as it came}} from the rosserhead <b>debarker.</b> Ensiling studies showed the lactic acid content was higher for hardwood bark litters than for softwood planer shavings. Softwood bark litter contained the least amount of lactic acid after fermentation in mini-silos. In vitro dry matter digestibility was higher for hardwood bark litters than for softwood bark litters or softwood planer shavings. No difference in in vitro dry matter digestibility was observed between raw and ensiled bark litter. No differences in ash, phosphorus, ether extract, nitrogen, total energy, and acid detergent fiber content were observed among the litters tested. The pH. of ensiled hardwood bark was lower than ensiled softwood bark. Results indicate that from a nutritive standpoint, bark litters are potentially useful as a ruminant feed.

30|$|Tree and sapling sizes {{affected}} {{the occurrence of}} <b>debarking</b> but the effects of sizes showed opposite patterns for trees and saplings (Tables  1 and 3). Higher percentages of <b>debarked</b> small trees were also reported in many previous studies (Akashi and Nakashizuka 1999; Yokoyama et al. 2001; Nagaike and Hayashi 2003; Jiang et al. 2005; Kiffner et al. 2008; Takeuchi et al. 2011; Borkowski and Ukalski 2012), although the reasons were not clarified. One possibility for the selective <b>debarking</b> of small trees is the relative ease of <b>debarking</b> smaller trees (Ando et al. 2004). In contrast to trees, the relationship between sapling size and the occurrence of <b>debarking</b> has rarely been examined. Takatsuki and Gorai (1994) compared the size structure of trees between two distinct areas in Japan that differed in deer density. They showed that forests with high deer density lacked saplings[*]>[*] 90  cm in height, whereas there were abundant saplings shorter than 90  cm in forests both under high and low deer densities. In the present study, {{one reason for the}} low <b>debarking</b> intensity on small saplings (Table  1) is that they are more difficult to find than large saplings. Consequently, saplings > 30  cm in height and[*]<[*] 3  cm in DBH might be more susceptible to <b>debarking</b> by deer, suggesting that these might be a possible optimal size for <b>debarking</b> by sika deer.|$|R
40|$|There is {{currently}} a global increase in Eucalyptus pulpwood plantations. Harvesting systems traditionally utilised in the northern hemisphere are being used in Eucalyptus pulpwood plantations worldwide. However, the small tree size and complexity of debarking Eucalyptus have provided harvesting with productivity and cost challenges not previously experienced in northern-hemisphere conditions. Much research has been invested in these two harvesting methods in northern-hemisphere species and conditions. There is little research available on mechanised processing-machine productivity and costs in Eucalyptus. This investigation aimed to quantify the effect that tree and bundle size has on the productivity of different processing machines in Eucalyptus plantation pulpwood. This was done through regression analysis, whereby productivity models that included tree size and bundle size were constructed. The research also aimed {{to determine whether or}} not the multi-stem systems were more cost-effective in smaller tree sizes. The research investigated five mechanised harvesting options that forestry managers could use in Eucalyptus pulpwood plantations. These systems consisted of one CTL system, one full-tree system with single-stem processing and three full-tree systems with multi-stem processing. The CTL system used a harvester to process the trees into logs and to extract them. The full-tree system with single-stem processing used a dangle-head processor (DHP) to process trees into logs. The first full-tree system with multi-stem processing used a chain-flail debrancher <b>debarker</b> (CFDD) to produce debarked and debranched tree lengths, which were slashed into logs. The remaining full-tree, multi-stem systems both produced chips. The first used a chain-flail debrancher <b>debarker</b> chipper (CFDDC) and the second, a CFDD feeding into a stand-alone disc chipper (CFDD&C). The productivity data, measured as m 3 per productive machine hour (PMH), was then statistically analysed using regression techniques. Productivity equations were formulated, considering tree size and bundle size, as well as the quadratic functions of these two variables and the interaction between them. Bundle size was only applicable to the multi-stem processing machines. The productivity equations successfully predicted processing-machine productivity, using tree size and bundle size as input variables. Apart from the 0. 075 m 3 tree size class, the CFDD had the highest overall productivity. The costs of the five systems were then calculated for different tree sizes. No single system was more cost-effective than the others across all tree sizes. In 0. 075 m 3 trees, the CFDDC system proved the most cost-effective. All systems evidenced high costs in the 0. 075 m 3 trees, ranging between $ 19. 43 per m 3 for the CFDDC system to $ 28. 84 for the harvester system. In 0. 40 m 3 trees, the cost differences between systems were lower, ranging from $ 6. 91 per m 3 for the DHP system to $ 11. 84 per m 3 for the CFDD&C. This study confirms that the CTL system was very expensive to operate in the small tree sizes (0. 075 m 3). There is a cross-over point at 0. 25 m 3 per tree, where the CTL system costs become lower than those of the full-tree system. At the 0. 40 m 3 tree size, the full-tree system is slightly more expensive than the CTL system. CopyrightDissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012.

Labour shortages and reliability of these systems has caused interest in alternative systems that {{might be able to}} debark A. mearnsii. The aim of the research is to compare three mechanised debarking technologies used to debark A. mearnsii. Research trials were conducted on the Demuth, Hyena and Hypro debarkers that would form part of semi-mechanised harvesting systems. The debarking technologies were analysed and compared in terms of productivity per productive machine hour (PMH), debarking quality, system costs {{and the quality of the}} bark that was produced. Furthermore, the effect that tree volume, strippability and form have on each of the debarking technologies was determined. The debarking technologies were affected by each of the factors researched. Decreasing tree form had a negative effect on the productivity of each of the technologies. An increase in strippability class (strengthening wood-bark bond strength) caused a decrease in the productivity of each of the machines. An increasing tree volume had a positive effect on the productivity for the three debarking technologies. After the debarking had taken place, samples of bark were analysed at a laboratory to determine if it was acceptable for the processing facilities. Each of the debarking technologies produced bark of varying dimensions, but they were all found to be acceptable. The system costs of the three debarking technologies were compared to a manual system cost at tree volumes of 0. 1 m³, 0. 15 m³ and 0. 2 m³.

40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Expert {{systems is}} an area of {{artificial}} intelligence that shows promise {{for a wide variety of}} applications, particularly in solving problems that have always been considered too large and complex for solution by conventional approaches. However, the process of eliciting expertise from an expert, knowledge acquisition, is recognized as the principal bottleneck in expert system development. This research explores the use of simulation for identifying knowledge for expert systems. With its capability for allowing experimentation on a model of a real system, computer simulation can be used to search for the best knowledge (strategies, constraints, scenarios, etc.), from among a set of alternatives, that optimizes system performance. Although developing high-level abstractions for decision schema that would be applicable to a large set of problem domains is desirable, it is extremely difficult. The focus of this study is the sawmill industry. A moderately complex and typical sawmill simulation system is modeled and used as a basis for developing a knowledge base to improve the material flow for the sawmill. The system components included in the system model are the bucksaw, <b>debarker,</b> headrig, gangsaw, flitch edger, and resaw. The inputs to the system are raw material mix, order file, product price, and operating times. The expert system's knowledge base is a set of operating policies which relate the constraints and actions in the form of production rules. Factors considered in the knowledge base involve material flow, machine breakdowns, queue capacities, and alternative routings. The methodology of using simulation for identifying knowledge for expert systems is developed. Simulation experiments are conducted and rules are generated based on the simulation system performance. The rules are recorded in an initial knowledge base and tested for interaction effects.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to study how the origin and {{treatment}} histories of spruce (Picea abies) and pine (Pinus radiata, Pinus sylvestris) bark influence on the extraction yield of tannin. The bark is produced in large quantities during the debarking process and is considered as waste in traditional forest industry. Bark is mainly used for energy production. In comparison to wood tissue, bark contains more extractives that could have potential for various applications in pharmaceutical industry or bio-based adhesives. Stilbenes, lignans, flavonoids and tannins are typical extractives in wood bark. In this Master’s thesis, {{the focus is on}} the extraction of tannins. Bark raw materials were obtained from pulp mills and sawmills. Bark samples were processed as air-dried (drying < 50 °C) or fresh as it is after debarking. Samples were extracted in rotating air bath reactors at 90 °C and 10 % consistency. Eight batches were hot water extracted and five different time points were studied: 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 minutes. The extracts were analyzed with three UV-spectrophotometric methods: Folin-Ciocalteu assay, UV- 280 nm method and Acid-Butanol assay. UV- 280 nm method was used in tannin yield calculations. Tannin yield was the highest from air-dried spruce bark from sawmill (5. 63 % from original dry bark). The second highest tannin yield (3. 33 %) was from air-dried sawmill pine (Pinus radiata) bark extract. Fresh sawmill spruce and pine bark extraction gave 2. 59 % and 2. 65 % for tannin yield, respectively. The poorest yields came from the pulp mill bark samples. Yields from fresh and air-dried pulp mill spruce barks were 0. 41 % and 0. 97 %, respectively. In comparison, the tannin yields from fresh and air-dried pulp mill pine (Scots pine) bark were 1. 13 % and 1. 20 %. Results showed that the tannin yield increased when the extraction time increased. Statistical analysis confirmed that the origin and the treatment have a significant influence on the extraction yield of tannin. The reason for the differences in the extraction yields between barks with different origins are probably related to the different debarking methods. Sawmill bark samples gave a significantly higher tannin yield than samples from pulp mill. In sawmills, logs are debarked as dry in rotary <b>debarker.</b> Drum debarkers are typically being used in pulp and paper mills where water is used in debarking process. Contact with water may leach water-soluble tannins from bark. This is in accordance with the results that bark from sawmill was found to be an optimal raw material for hot water extraction. Further research should focus on optimizing hot water extraction conditions eg. by applications of chemicals...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{feasibility}} of processing and marketing the hardwood bark and finewood residue materials generated by the primary wood using industries located within the project study area (an area encompassing all of Illinois and area fifty miles wide surrounding Illinois). The study (1970 through 1973) involved three separate phases of work. The first phase developed information regarding the sources of residue materials both with regard to the geographic distribution of the mills generating the residues and with regard to the quantities produced by the various types of mills within the project area. The data developed indicated that 71 of the saw mills considered to be large enough to justify <b>debarker</b> installations and the six pulp mills operating in the study area could have generated an estimated 1, 125, 000 cubic yards and finewood residue materials in 1970 if all the round wood processed had been debarked. The mills with debarkers Installed in 1970 generated about 528, 000 cubic yards of residue bark and an additional 335, 800 cubic yards of finewood residues (sawdust and shavings). The remaining indicated potential supply of residue materials (261, 200 cubic yards) is the residue materials that could have been produced by those larger mills that had not installed debarking equipment at the time the study was made. The second phase of the project or marketing study developed information regarding the market project area when used only as mulches, soil conditioners, bedding, litter and for other closely related type uses. The eleven user-groups contacted in the marketing survey represented approximately 7, 300 potential marketing outlets for these materials. This figure excludes the livestock producers. The eleven user-groups surveyed used and/or sold approximately 2, 902, 000 cubic yards of all types of mulching materiasl in 1971. It was estimated the twelfth user-group considered (all Commercial livestock producers) uses an additional 26, 000, 000 cubic yards of bedding and litter materials annually. By applying estimated replacement ratios of wood residue products for the various other types of materials now used and/or sold by these various user-groups, it appears a market potential of approximately 1, 979, 000 cubic yards of wood residue products could be developed in the marketing area. This indicates that potential markets in excess of the quantities of bark and wood residue generated by the primary wood using industries can be developed over the next five to seven years. The third phase of the study examined, through operational analysis procedures, the economic aspects of processing and distributing residue products from eight assumed processing sites to nine major marketing points within Illinois. The MPS/ 360 linear programming routine (6), a basic cost minimization procedure, was modified to develop a profit maximization model. The purpose was to determine what the optimum flow of the various types of residue products would be from the eight assumed processing points (including external sources) to the nine marketing points selected in the study area. Various spacial analyses were made wherein the objective functional elements of the matrix (production costs, transportation costs and product selling prices) as well as flow constraints were varied to demonstrate the sensitivity of optimum flow solutions to these variable cost and price elements. Spacial Analysis IV indicates all residue materials in the project area could be dispersed profitably if the average delivered prices of 11. 88 per cubic yard for bagged mulches, 6. 72 per cubic yard for bulk processed bark and 3. 25 per cubic yard for bedding and litter prevail. Returns of approximately 5, 500, 000 would accrue to the primary wood processing firms participating in the production and distribution of these residue products, 34 percent of which would derive from sources outside the project area...|$|E

30|$|In {{addition}} to size and species as factors for <b>debarking,</b> elevation zones and grassland area also {{were associated with}} the damage to subalpine forests by deer. Low sapling density and high risk of <b>debarking</b> of trees and saplings were found in low elevation plots (Table  2). Other studies in Japan also found the intensities of <b>debarking</b> on trees and saplings in subalpine coniferous forests to be greater at lower elevations (Takeuchi et al. 2011). In our study area, sika deer migrate to high-elevation areas in summer and to low-elevation areas from late autumn to late spring (Izumiyama and Mochizuki 2008) although there are some deer in low-elevation area even in summer. Then, opportunities of <b>debarking</b> for saplings and trees were larger in low-elevation zone than in high-elevation because deer stay longer time in low elevation-area than in high elevation-area. In {{addition to}} elevation, we found that the large subalpine grassland caused low sapling density (Table  2) and high risk of the occurrence of <b>debarking</b> of saplings and trees (Tables  1 and 3). Deer would likely be attracted to subalpine grassland because it has numerous herbaceous plants that serve as rich food sources (Takatsuki 1986; Winnie 2012). Trees and saplings in subalpine forests near subalpine grassland would be eaten by deer before sprout of grasses in early spring and after defoliation of grasses in late autumn. Some sika deer migrate to high-elevation area before sprout of grasses and after defoliation to escape the competition with other deer in low-elevation areas (Shin-ichiro Hamasaki, personal communication). Minimum distance to subalpine grassland, however, had only a marginal effect on the occurrence of <b>debarking</b> of saplings and trees (Tables  1 and 3). As the result of intensive <b>debarking</b> on saplings (Fig.  3), low sapling density near subalpine grassland occurred (Table  2) and then it might be obscure the relationship between the distance to grassland and the occurrence of <b>debarking</b> of saplings. In the future, the intensity of <b>debarking</b> of tree would increase if deer density remains at this level or increases.|$|R

A total of 204 trees were <b>debarked.</b> Main results: The new systems obtain better results: productivity is higher, the percentage of pieces is slightly lower and production costs are reduced, except for one system. <b>Debarking</b> quality improves with the new tools as cork is extracted in a more precise and cleaner manner, thus permitting cork manufacturers to obtain higher yields from the cork planks. Research highlights: Semi-skilled operators using the new tools obtain very similar results to skilled operators using axes. This would therefore resolve the problem of the lack of skilled labor, while improving the working conditions of operators. The results demonstrate that the new tools are viable for cork <b>debarking</b> and can bring potential benefits to the sector.

40|$|Problem statement: Indonesian pine logs (Pinus merkusii Yungh. et de Vr.) are {{vulnerable}} to attack by ambrosia beetle Xyleborus sp. Fresh cut logs kept for months in logging area are subject to heavily attack by the beetles. Approach: An experiment was conducted to evaluate effectiveness of <b>debarking</b> and insecticidal treatments using cypermethrin on fresh logs of the wood species on attack by the ambrosia beetle. Insecticide solutions of 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0, 2. 5 and 3. 0 % (v/v) were applied and the expeiment was kept in shady area for 60 days. Results: It was shown that <b>debarking</b> might increase the logs vulnerability. The beetle attacks on the untreated <b>debarked</b> logs (control) steadily increased from about 10 tunnels at the first week to about 80 tunnels per-square meter {{at the end of}} the experiment. Treatment with cypermethrin solution of 2. 5 % or more on <b>debarked</b> logs significantly protected the logs against the beetle. Meanwhile only a few tunnels were found on the bark-on logs at the first week and not more than 20 tunnels per-square meter at the end. Conclusion/Recommendation: The <b>debarked</b> fresh cut logs of the Indonesian pine should be treated with cypermethrin solution of 2. 5 % or more to prevent the ambrosia beetle attack Xyleborus sp. However bark-on logs are more preferred than the <b>debarked</b> ones because the bark will prevent the beetle attack and it is also environmentally more acceptable because no insectisidal treatment is required. <b>Debarking</b> process on the pine logs is also difficult so it will increase the production cost...|$|R

For all trees with the diameter at breast height (DBH)[*]>[*] 3  cm in the plots, we noted the species and measured DBH {{and the presence}} of <b>debarking.</b> Furthermore, for saplings survey, 8 subplots (each of 1  m[*]×[*] 2  m) were established at 10 -m intervals along the two long sides of each plot (8 subplots per a plot). Height and the occurrence of <b>debarking</b> on saplings > 30  cm in height and < 3  cm in DBH were measured and recorded in each subplot. In this study, we could not determine the timing of the occurrence of <b>debarking</b> and did not distinguish new and old <b>debarking.</b>|$|R
