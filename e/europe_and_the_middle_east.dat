5|$|Olivia Mary Manning CBE (2 March 1908â€“ 23 July 1980) was a British novelist, poet, {{writer and}} reviewer. Her fiction and non-fiction, {{frequently}} detailing journeys and personal odysseys, were principally set in England, Ireland, <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East.</b> She often wrote from her personal experience, though her books also demonstrate strengths in imaginative writing. Her books are widely admired for her artistic eye and vivid descriptions of place.|$|E
5|$|Many {{hundreds}} of medicines {{are derived from}} plants, both traditional medicines used in herbalism and chemical substances purified from plants or first identified in them, sometimes by ethnobotanical search, and then synthesised for use in modern medicine. Modern medicines derived from plants include aspirin, taxol, morphine, quinine, reserpine, colchicine, digitalis and vincristine. Plants used in herbalism include ginkgo, echinacea, feverfew, and Saint John's wort. The pharmacopoeia of Dioscorides, De Materia Medica, describing some 600 medicinal plants, was written between 50 and 70 AD and remained in use in <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> until around 1600 AD; it was the precursor of all modern pharmacopoeias.|$|E
5|$|In May 1970, Adi Da, Nina, and {{a friend}} from Scientology named Pat Morley gave away their {{belongings}} and traveled to India for what they believed would be an indefinite period living at Swami Muktananda's ashram. However, Adi Da was disappointed by his experience there, especially by the numbers of other Americans who had arrived since his previous visit. Three weeks after arriving, Adi Da said that visions of the Virgin Mary (that he interpreted as a personification of divine feminine power, or shakti) directed {{him to make a}} pilgrimage to Christian holy sites. After two weeks in <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>east,</b> all three returned to New York before moving to Los Angeles in August.|$|E

5|$|Istanbul's {{strategic}} {{position on the}} historic Silk Road, rail networks to <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East,</b> and the only sea route between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean have produced a cosmopolitan populace, although less so since {{the establishment of the}} Turkish Republic in 1923. Overlooked for the new capital Ankara during the interwar period, the city has since regained much of its prominence. The population of the city has increased tenfold since the 1950s, as migrants from across Anatolia have moved in and city limits have expanded to accommodate them. Arts, music, film, and cultural festivals were established {{at the end of the}} 20th century and continue to be hosted by the city today. Infrastructure improvements have produced a complex transportation network.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the Crusades in general, and {{particularly}} that of the First Crusade, is widely debated among historians. The confusion is partially due to the numerous armies in the first crusade, and their lack of direct unity. The similar ideologies held the armies to similar goals, but the connections were rarely strong, and the unity broke down often. The Crusades are most commonly linked to {{the political and social}} situation in 11th-century Europe, the rise of a reform movement within the papacy, and the political and religious confrontation of Christianity and Islam in <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East.</b> Christianity had spread throughout Europe, Africa, and the Middle East in Late Antiquity, but by the early 8th century Christian rule had become limited to Europe and Anatolia after the Muslim conquests.|$|E
5|$|Manning explores {{these themes}} {{not only in}} her major novels set in <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East,</b> but also in her Irish fiction, The Wind Changes (1937) and eight short stories which were mostly written early in her career. In these works, {{colonialist}} attitudes are reproduced by Manning's stereotyping of Catholic southerners as wild, primitive and undisciplined, while northerners live lives of well-ordered efficiency. Displaced principal characters struggle to find their place in social groups whose values they no longer accept. Manning has also been noted for her direct and early focus {{on the impact of}} the end of colonial rule. The Rain Forest (1974) presents a later, highly pessimistic view, satirising British expatriate values on a fictional island. It also critiques those involved in the independence movement, expressing a disillusioned view of the island's future post-independence prospects.|$|E

5|$|In 1859, Seward {{was advised}} by his {{political}} supporters {{that he would}} be better off avoiding additional controversial statements, and left the country for an eight-month tour of <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East.</b> Seward spent two months in London, meeting with the Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston, and was presented at Court to Queen Victoria. Seward returned to Washington in January 1860 to find controversy: that some southerners blamed him for his rhetoric, which they believed had inspired John Brown to try to start a slave insurrection. Brown was captured and executed; nevertheless, Mississippi representatives Reuben Davis and Otho Singleton each stated that if Seward or another Radical Republican was elected, he would meet with the resistance of a united South. To rebut such allegations, and to set forth his views in the hope of receiving the nomination, Seward made a major speech in the Senate on February 29, 1860, which most praised, though white southerners were offended, and some abolitionists also objected because the senator, in his speech, said that Brown was justly punished. The Republican National Committee ordered 250,000 copies in pamphlet form, and eventually twice that many were printed.|$|E
