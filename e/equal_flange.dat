40|$|An {{approximate}} {{analytical procedure}} {{is presented to}} estimate the elastic story drift of steel moment frames with the radius-cut RBS (reduced beam section). Due to the geometric configuration of the radius-cut RBS, the mathematical formulation is complicated when applying the conjugate beam method to compute the component of story drift contributed by the beam. In this study, the problem is circumvented by replacing the original radius-cut RBS with an equivalent beam of constant width. The equivalence {{between the two is}} established by imposing the <b>equal</b> <b>flange</b> elongation criterion over the RBS region. This approach is justified based on the calibrated finite element analysis. The story drift components contributed by the column, the panel zone, and the beam are then formulated into a closed form for a typical beam-column subassembly. Case studies are also performed within some practical ranges of frame configurations to investigate the stiffness changes introduced by the RBS connection. The derived results can readily be used by the designers to estimate the RBS frame story drift and the effect of the stiffness variations...|$|E
40|$|Appendix F of the AISC-LRFD Specification {{governs the}} design of web-tapered I-shaped beams. These design {{provisions}} are restricted to beams with <b>equal</b> <b>flange</b> areas and non-slender webs. However, the current practice in the low-rise metal building industry is to employ flanges of unequal area and slender webs; a time honored practice {{that has resulted in}} safe and economical structures. The current study utilizes validated nonlinear finite element analysis techniques to predict the flexural response and corresponding limit states associated with mild-carbon steel doubly-symmetric web-tapered I-shaped beams. A parametric study is performed to study the moment capacity and flexural ductility in the inelastic range of various beam geometries with length-to-depth ratios between two and three (i. e. what one normally encounters in the rafter sections of a low-rise metal building gable frame). Compactness criteria that ensure attainment of a rotation capacity equal to three are examined and results tabulated. A comparison is made between the Specification design provisions and the ultimate moment capacity and structural ductility predicted by the finite element method. Conclusions are made regarding the effects of plate slenderness on the behavior of the nonprismatic beam models. Recommendations are made for further research of singly-symmetric web-tapered beams...|$|E
40|$|The {{geometry}} of angle sections is simple, but the behaviour and design calculations of angle sections {{can be quite}} complicated. Furthermore, lipped angle sections with unequal flange widths form a non-symmetric section and the behaviour of the section is even more complicated than a singly-symmetric angle section with <b>equal</b> <b>flange</b> widths. A test program on cold-formed steel non-symmetric lipped angle columns is presented. The non-symmetric angle sections were brake-pressed from high strength structural steel sheets having nominal yield stresses of 450 and 550 MPa with plate thicknesses of 1. 0, 1. 5 and 1. 9  mm. The material properties of the column specimens were obtained by tensile coupon tests. The behaviour and strengths of cold-formed steel non-symmetric lipped angle columns were investigated. The test strengths are compared with the design strengths calculated using the North American Specification {{for the design of}} cold-formed steel structural members. In addition, the current design rules in the North American Specification for cold-formed steel non-symmetric lipped angle columns are assessed using reliability analysis. It is shown that the design strengths are generally quite conservative. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} an experimental and numerical investigation on the bending strength and behaviour of cold-formed (CF) steel built-up flexural members. Eight specimens in two groups, {{first group of}} four specimens with <b>equal</b> <b>flanges</b> and second group of four specimens with unequal flanges have been fabricated and experimented. The experimental results show the modes of buckling and their influence on the bending strength and behaviour of CF built-up I sections. The experimental results are also verified by simulating finite element models and analysed using FEM software ANSYS. The results obtained are in good agreement with the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|An {{algorithm}} is {{developed for the}} optimum design of a single span steel plate girder with <b>equal</b> <b>flanges</b> and unstiffened web. The height of the girder varies linearly. The flange width, flange thickness, and web thickness are discrete variables. The {{algorithm is}} formulated as a multilevel decision making process. The optimum values of the design variables are obtained subject to nonlinear behavior functions limiting stresses and deflection, and side constraints restricting the range and independence of the variables. A nonlinear objective function involving cost of material and fabrication is used as the criterion for optimization. Optimization procedures are formulated using dynamic programming. The characteristics of the algorithm are demonstrated {{by a number of}} design examples, and the designs produced by the algorithm are related to the traditional design procedure...|$|R
40|$|The {{so-called}} 3 -factor {{formula is}} one of the most commonly employed general formulae to estimate the elastic critical moment of steel beams prone to lateral-torsional buckling. This work extends its domain of application to I-section cantilevers (i) with <b>equal</b> or unequal <b>flanges,</b> (ii) fully built-in or free to warp at the support and (iii) acted on by uniformly distributed or concentrated tip loads (applied either at the shear centre or at one of the flanges). The paper includes (i) a discussion of the theoretical basis of elastic lateral-torsional buckling, (ii) the description of the main steps involved in posing the buckling problem in a non-dimensional form over a fixed reference domain, features that are particularly convenient for the purpose of this work, (iii) the numerical results of a parametric study, obtained by the Rayleigh-Ritz method, and (iv) their use for the development of approximate analytical expressions for the C 1,C 2 and C 3 factors appearing in the aforementioned formula.

40|$|The {{deck load}} {{capacity}} of new offshore platforms is increasing as these marine structures {{continue to increase}} in size. As a consequence, the structural weight has become a concern. The current investigation contributes to a solution of a more weight-effective structural design of shell-plated marine structures. The structural weight of a shell-plated structure can be reduced in various ways. In the current investigation, an alternative design is presented {{by means of a}} corrugated structure. By the introduction of corrugated panels, a structure may be constructed lighter and cheaper compared to traditional structures with stiffened panels. The welding work during manufacturing can also be reduced substantially. Even though the idea of using corrugated shell plating has been practiced in various applications for a long time, such as in corrugated bulkhead and deck plating, it is yet unexplored in shell structures. Thus, the aim with this study is to compare corrugated shell plating with conventional stiffened panels with respect to strength, weight and cost. A methodology is presented where various solutions are analyzed and compared with regard to strength characteristics, weight and cost. Here, strength characteristics include ultimate tensile strength, buckling stability and fatigue life calculations. Detailed numerical analyses are presented using a realistic and reasonable area of a panel structure of an offshore platform. The structure analyses are carried out using linear finite element analyses. A number of design criteria have been evaluated and verified by comparing predictions obtained in an extensive parametric study of basic structural strength following classification rules. Two alternative designs with corrugated shell plating are proposed with respect to corrugation symmetry. The first one had unequal flanges and the same thickness as that of the reference stiffened model. The second had <b>equal</b> <b>flange</b> lengths. The weight reduction values achieved using these designs were 38 percent and 59 percent in shell plating, respectively, compared with a reference model for traditional stiffened shell plating. The study concluded with a reduction in production costs by 35 percent and 49 percent, respectively. The investigation clearly demonstrates that corrugated panels are often favourable for lightweight design and manufacturing robustness of marine structures...|$|E
