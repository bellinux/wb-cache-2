5|$|The {{mechanical}} {{concept of}} the <b>epicyclic</b> gears used to keep each book level as it rotates was later used for the Falkirk Wheel boat lift, although its designer claims to have found it independently.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the turn}} of the millennium, the Arabic {{astronomer}} and polymath Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen) presented a development of Ptolemy's geocentric <b>epicyclic</b> models in terms of nested spheres. Despite the similarity of this concept to that of Ptolemy's Planetary Hypotheses, al-Haytham's presentation differs in sufficient detail that {{it has been argued that}} it reflects an independent development of the concept. In chapters 15–16 of his Book of Optics, Ibn al-Haytham also said that the celestial spheres do not consist of solid matter.|$|E
5|$|The bookwheel, in {{its most}} {{commonly}} seen form, was invented by Italian military engineer Agostino Ramelli in 1588, presented {{as one of the}} 195 designs in Le diverse et artificiose machine del Capitano Agostino Ramelli (The various and ingenious machines of Captain Agostino Ramelli). To ensure that the books remained at a constant angle, Ramelli incorporated an <b>epicyclic</b> gearing arrangement, a complex device that had only previously been used in astronomical clocks. Ramelli's design is unnecessarily elaborate, as he likely understood that gravity could have worked just as effectively (as it does with a Ferris wheel, invented centuries later), but the gearing system allowed him to display his mathematical prowess. While other people would go on to build bookwheels based on Ramelli's design, Ramelli did not in fact ever construct his own.|$|E
5|$|The first geared {{clock was}} invented in the 11th century by the Arab {{engineer}} Ibn Khalaf al-Muradi in Islamic Iberia; it was a water clock that employed a complex gear train mechanism, including both segmental and <b>epicyclic</b> gearing, capable of transmitting high torque. The clock was unrivalled in its use of sophisticated complex gearing, until the mechanical clocks of the mid-14th century. Al-Muradi's clock also employed the use of mercury in its hydraulic linkages, which could function mechanical automata. Al-Muradi's work was known to scholars working under Alfonso X of Castile, hence the mechanism {{may have played a}} role in the development of the European mechanical clocks. Other monumental water clocks constructed by medieval Muslim engineers also employed complex gear trains and arrays of automata. Like the earlier Greeks and Chinese, Arab engineers at the time also developed a liquid-driven escapement mechanism which they employed in some of their water clocks. Heavy floats were used as weights and a constant-head system was used as an escapement mechanism, which was present in the hydraulic controls they used to make heavy floats descend at a slow and steady rate.|$|E
25|$|An <b>epicyclic</b> {{differential}} can use <b>epicyclic</b> gearing {{to split}} and apportion torque asymmetrically between {{the front and}} rear axles. An <b>epicyclic</b> differential {{is at the heart of}} the Toyota Prius automotive drive train, where it interconnects the engine, motor-generators, and the drive wheels (which have a second differential for splitting torque as usual). It has the advantage of being relatively compact along the length of its axis (that is, the sun gear shaft).|$|E
25|$|In a paper {{published}} in 2012 Carman, Thorndike, and Evans also proposed {{a system of}} <b>epicyclic</b> gearing with pin and slot followers.|$|E
25|$|Differential {{braking systems}} are {{essentially}} an <b>epicyclic</b> transmission {{with a single}} fixed gear ratio transmitted through idler pinions. The controlled differential adds an extension to the rack holding the idlers, and puts a conventional brake on that extension. With the brake applied, the idlers are locked and the system works like a conventional <b>epicyclic.</b> When the brake is released, the idlers spin, reducing the speed of rotation on that side. This causes the output on that side to slow down by a fixed amount.|$|E
25|$|Ptolemy's <b>epicyclic</b> {{solar system}} (still 300 {{years in the}} future from the {{apparent}} date of the mechanism), carried forward with more epicycles, was more accurate predicting the positions of planets than the view of Copernicus, until Kepler introduced the possibility that orbits are ellipses.|$|E
25|$|The first engine later {{received}} an <b>epicyclic</b> {{propeller reduction gear}} made by Allison, an increase in its compression ratio, a Scintilla magneto ignition, and the new design cylinder banks of the 3A-1500 inverted engines, a design that had both spark plugs on the outside for easier maintenance.|$|E
25|$|In simple terms, a DSG is two {{separate}} manual gearboxes (and clutches) contained within one housing and working as one unit. It {{was designed by}} BorgWarner and is licensed to the Volkswagen Group, with support by IAV GmbH. By using two independent clutches, a DSG can achieve faster shift times and eliminates the torque converter of a conventional <b>epicyclic</b> automatic transmission.|$|E
25|$|The Bureau of Aeronautics {{analyzed}} {{the possibilities of}} the plane becoming a competitive race plane, and decided that the extra weight of the supercharger could be better put to use by installing an <b>epicyclic</b> reduction gear, for improved propeller efficiency, thereby providing greater improvement in performance than what the supercharged engine with a direct drive propeller could provide for the same weight.|$|E
25|$|<b>Epicyclic</b> gears {{are also}} called {{planetary}} gears because the axes {{of the planet}} gears revolve around the common axis {{of the sun and}} ring gears that they mesh with and roll between. In the image, the yellow shaft carries the sun gear which is almost hidden. The blue gears are called planet gears and the pink gear is the ring gear or annulus.|$|E
25|$|The {{inferior}} planet mechanism {{includes the}} sun (treated as a planet in this context), Mercury, and Venus. For {{each of the}} three systems there is an <b>epicyclic</b> gear whose axis is mounted on b1, thus the basic frequency is the Earth year (as it is, in truth, for <b>epicyclic</b> motion in the sun and all the planets—excepting only the moon). Each meshes with a gear grounded to the mechanism frame. Each has a pin mounted, potentially on an extension of one side of the gear that enlarges the gear, but doesn't interfere with the teeth; in some cases the needed distance between the gear's centre and the pin is farther than the radius of the gear itself. A bar with a slot along its length extends from the pin toward the appropriate coaxial tube, at whose other end is the object pointer, {{out in front of the}} front dials. The bars could have been full gears, although there is no need for the waste of metal, since the only working part is the slot. Also, using the bars avoids interference between the three mechanisms, each of which are set on one of the four spokes of b1. Thus there is one new grounded gear (one was identified in the wreckage, and the second is shared by two of the planets), one gear used to reverse the direction of the sun anomaly, three <b>epicyclic</b> gears and three bars/coaxial tubes/pointers, which would qualify as another gear each. Five gears and three slotted bars in all.|$|E
25|$|During the war Daimler {{built more}} than 6,600 Scout Cars and some 2,700 Mk I and Mk II Armoured Cars. Daimler also {{provided}} tank components, including <b>epicyclic</b> gearboxes for 2,500 Crusader, Covenanter and Cavalier tanks. They built 74,000 Bren gun, initially at a workshop in their Coventry factory and, after the workshop {{was destroyed in}} the April 1941 raid, at a boot and shoe factory in Burton-on-Trent.|$|E
25|$|The Pañcasiddhāntikā by Varāhamihira (505 CE) approximates {{the method}} for {{determination}} of the meridian direction from any three positions of the shadow using a gnomon. By the time of Aryabhata the motion of planets was treated to be elliptical rather than circular. Other topics included definitions of different units of time, eccentric models of planetary motion, <b>epicyclic</b> models of planetary motion, and planetary longitude corrections for various terrestrial locations.|$|E
25|$|At {{least two}} {{pointers}} indicated positions of bodies upon the ecliptic. A lunar pointer indicated {{the position of}} the moon, and a mean sun pointer also was shown, perhaps doubling as the current date pointer. The moon position was not a simple mean moon indicator that would indicate movement uniformly around a circular orbit; it approximated the acceleration and deceleration of the moon's elliptical orbit, through the earliest extant use of <b>epicyclic</b> gearing.|$|E
25|$|Ancient Greece {{developed}} {{machines in}} both {{civilian and military}} domains. The Antikythera mechanism, the first known mechanical computer, and the mechanical inventions of Archimedes are examples of early mechanical engineering. Some of Archimedes' inventions {{as well as the}} Antikythera mechanism required sophisticated knowledge of differential gearing or <b>epicyclic</b> gearing, two key principles in machine theory that helped design the gear trains of the Industrial Revolution, and are still widely used today in diverse fields such as robotics and automotive engineering.|$|E
25|$|On 27 May the AIBN {{released}} an update to the preliminary investigation report where they confirmed that scenarios under consideration included failure of <b>epicyclic</b> module, suspension bar (lift strut) attachment and MGB (gearbox) conical housing. On {{the same day}} Airbus Helicopters updated their press release bulletin and stated that in their opinion only failure of the attachment of a suspension bar could be assessed as probable {{based on the information}} available by that date, an opinion also stated by Airbus during a safety meeting on 20 May.|$|E
25|$|The {{engine and}} {{transmission}} {{are provided by}} German companies MTU and Renk respectively. The water-cooled engine generates 1,400hp and is integrated with an Indian turbocharger and <b>epicyclic</b> train gearbox with four forward and 2 reverse gears. A local transmission is under trials and it is envisioned to ultimately replace the Renk-supplied unit. The tracks which were being supplied by German company Diehl are now being manufactured by L. The cooling pack has been designed for desert operations. The Arjun has a lower ground pressure than the lighter T-72, due to its design.|$|E
25|$|On 28 April 2017 the AIBN {{released}} a new preliminary report {{with an update}} of the investigation progress {{one year after the}} accident. In this report they stated that the accident was a result of a fatigue fracture in one of the eight second stage planet gears in the <b>epicyclic</b> module of the main rotor gearbox and that the crack initiation appeared to be a surface micro-pit. The origin of the micro-pit was considered unknown at the time when the report was published. Also unknown is whether the fracture occurred momentarily or over several flight hours, and whether fracture fragments were spalled for detection by maintenance systems as happened in G-REDL. The issue is related to the airworthiness certificate of the aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Internal gearing is {{so called}} {{because all the}} gears {{involved}} are hidden within a wheel hub. Hub gears work using internal planetary, or <b>epicyclic,</b> gearing which alters {{the speed of the}} hub casing and wheel relative to the speed of the drive sprocket. They have just a single chainring and a single rear sprocket, almost always with a straight chain path between the two. Hub gears are available with between 2 and 14 speeds; weight and price tend to increase with the number of gears. All the advertised speeds are available as distinct gear ratios controlled by a single shifter (except for some early 5-speed models which used two shifters). Hub gearing is often used for bicycles intended for city-riding and commuting.|$|E
25|$|The first water clocks {{to employ}} complex {{segmental}} and <b>epicyclic</b> gearing was invented earlier by the Arab engineer Ibn Khalaf al-Muradi in Islamic Iberia c. 1000. His water clocks were driven by water wheels, as {{was also the}} case for several Chinese water clocks in the 11th century. Comparable water clocks were built in Damascus and Fez. The latter (Dar al-Magana) remains until today and its mechanism has been reconstructed. The first European clock to employ these complex gears was the astronomical clock created by Giovanni de Dondi in c. 1365. Like the Chinese, Arab engineers at the time also developed an escapement mechanism which they employed in some of their water clocks. The escapement mechanism was {{in the form of}} a constant-head system, while heavy floats were used as weights.|$|E
25|$|The {{superior}} planet systems—Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn—all {{follow the}} same general principle of the lunar anomaly mechanism. Similar to the inferior systems, each has a gear whose centre pivot is on an extension of b1, and which meshes with a grounded gear. It presents a pin and a centre pivot for the <b>epicyclic</b> gear which has a slot for the pin, and which meshes with a gear fixed to a coaxial tube and thence to the pointer. Each of the three mechanisms can fit within a quadrant of the b1 extension, and they are thus all on a single plane parallel with the front dial plate. Each one uses a ground gear, a driving gear, a driven gear, and a gear/coaxial tube/pointer, thus, twelve gears additional in all.|$|E
25|$|The 1904 models had 2470cc, four-cylinder, water-cooled, overhead-valve engines {{featuring}} pressure lubrication, {{very unusual}} at the time, {{and were now}} mounted with the <b>epicyclic</b> gearbox between the front seats rather than centrally resulting a design with the driver sitting well forwards and no bonnet. Six-cylinder models joined the line up in 1906. The specification started to become more conventional with wheel steering as an option from 1908, becoming standard {{from the end of}} 1911, and pedals and gear lever replacing the original two-lever system of gear changing. George Lanchester was now in charge, Frederick having resigned in 1913, and the engine moved further forward to a conventional position in the sporting, side-valve, 5.5-litre six-cylinder Forty but very few were made before the outbreak of World War I. A distinctive feature of the engine's valves was their use of leaf springs, rather than coil springs. Frank Lanchester ran the London sales office.|$|E
25|$|Having {{the beam}} {{connected}} to the piston shaft by a means that applied force alternately in both directions also meant {{that it was possible}} to use the motion of the beam to turn a wheel. The most simple solution to transforming the action of the beam into a rotating motion was to connect the beam to a wheel by a crank, but because another party had patent rights on the use of the crank, Watt was obliged to come up with another solution. He adopted the <b>epicyclic</b> sun and planet gear system suggested by an employee William Murdoch, only later reverting, once the patent rights had expired, to the more familiar crank seen on most engines today. The main wheel attached to the crank was large and heavy, serving as a flywheel which, once set in motion, by its momentum maintained a constant power and smoothed the action of the alternating strokes. To its rotating central shaft, belts and gears could be attached to drive a great variety of machinery.|$|E
25|$|The {{basis for}} the modern {{understanding}} of orbits was first formulated by Johannes Kepler whose results are summarised in his three laws of planetary motion. First, {{he found that the}} orbits of the planets in our solar system are elliptical, not circular (or <b>epicyclic),</b> as had previously been believed, and that the Sun is not located {{at the center of the}} orbits, but rather at one focus. Second, he found that the orbital speed of each planet is not constant, as had previously been thought, but rather that the speed depends on the planet's distance from the Sun. Third, Kepler found a universal relationship between the orbital properties of all the planets orbiting the Sun. For the planets, the cubes of their distances from the Sun are proportional to the squares of their orbital periods. Jupiter and Venus, for example, are respectively about 5.2 and 0.723 AU distant from the Sun, their orbital periods respectively about 11.86 and 0.615 years. The proportionality is seen by the fact that the ratio for Jupiter, 5.23/11.862, is practically equal to that for Venus, 0.7233/0.6152, in accord with the relationship. Idealised orbits meeting these rules are known as Kepler orbits.|$|E

2500|$|A {{spur gear}} {{differential}} is constructed from two identical coaxial <b>epicyclic</b> gear trains assembled {{with a single}} carrier such that their planet gears are engaged. [...] This forms a planetary gear train with a fixed carrier train ratio R = -1.|$|E
2500|$|A further {{change was}} made to the transmission. Rather than risk the {{availability}} of the combined Wilson transmission and steering affecting production, the A13 [...] "crash" [...] gear box was used with <b>epicyclic</b> steering units. This had the knock-on effect of a reduced size of cooling fan for the transmission compartment.|$|E
2500|$|... 1 April 2009 – A Bond Offshore Helicopters AS332L2 with 16 {{people on}} board crashed into the North Sea [...] off Crimond on the Aberdeenshire coast; there were no survivors.

2500|$|In {{discussing}} the spur gear differential, {{the use of}} the term annular gear is a convenient way to distinguish the sun gears of the two <b>epicyclic</b> gear trains. [...] The second sun gear serves the same purpose as the annular gear of a simple planetary gear train, but clearly does not have the internal gear mate that is typical of an annular gear.|$|E
2500|$|Successful {{application}} {{began in}} airplanes and tanks {{before and during}} World War II. In Britain, the Daimler [...] Company used disc brakes on its Daimler Armoured Car of 1939, the disc brakes, made by the Girling company, were necessary because in that four-wheel drive (4x4) vehicle the <b>epicyclic</b> final drive was in the wheel hubs and therefore left no room for conventional hub-mounted drum brakes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mechanical}} transmissions {{used for}} railroad propulsion {{are generally more}} complex and much more robust than standard-road versions. [...] There is usually a fluid coupling interposed between the engine and gearbox, and the gearbox is often of the <b>epicyclic</b> (planetary) type to permit shifting while under load. [...] Various systems have been devised to minimise the break in transmission during gear changing; e.g., the S.S.S. (synchro-self-shifting) gearbox used by Hudswell Clarke.|$|E
