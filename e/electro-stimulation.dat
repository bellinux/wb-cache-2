40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of treatment with water, n-butanol and ether extracts of Hypercom perforatum L. on epileptogenesis in rabbits. Animals from the control group received solvent-ethanol, and the kindling model of epilepsy was used. Epileptic focus was induced in Chinchilla rabbits by stimulation of the hippocampus. The following parameters were determined: the minimum current strength necessary to induce after-discharge (AD) – discharges appearing after cessation of stimulation; AD duration; the number of stimulations necessary to induce spontaneous kindling; and the latency time for the development of full kindling. The results obtained indicate that epileptogenesis is influenced by Hypericum perforatum L. extract treatment. Animals treated with an ether extract of Hypericum perforatum L. required significantly weaker minimum current strengths for the development of epileptogenic focus, and displayed longer AD times, while the number of <b>electro-stimulations</b> necessary for full kindling was less. In contrast, animals treated with water and n-butanol extracts required increased <b>electro-stimulations</b> for the development of epileptic discharge, and displayed shortened AD durations versus controls...|$|R
40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} that the nanopore terraces constructed on a multilayer graphene sheet could be employed to con-trol the conformation and transportation of an ssDNA for nanopore sequencing. As adsorbed on a terraced graphene na-nopore, the ssDNA has no in-plane swing nearby the nanopore, and can be locked on graphene terraces in a stretched con-formation. Under biasing, the accumulated ions near the nanopore promote the translocation of the locked ssDNA, and also disturb the balance between the driven force and resistance force acted on the nucleotide in pore. A critical force {{is found to be}} necessary in trigging the kickoff of the ssDNA translocation, implying an inherent field effect of the terraced graphene nanopore. By changing the intensities of electric field as trigger signal, the stop and go of an ssDNA in the nanopore are manipulated at single nucleobase level. The velocity of ssDNA in the nanopore can also be regulated by the frequency of the <b>electro-stimulations.</b> As a result, a new scheme of controllable translocation of ssDNA in graphene nanopores is realized by introducing controllers and triggers, appealing more explorations in experiment.

40|$|Pressure sores are {{localized}} {{injuries to}} the skin and underlying tissues and are mainly resulting from overpressure. Paraplegic peoples are particularly subjects to pressure sores because of long-time seated postures and sensory deprivation at the lower limbs. Here we report outcomes of a feasibility trial involving a biofeedback system aimed at reducing buttock overpressure whilst an individual is seated. The system consists of (1) pressure sensors, (2) a laptop coupling sensors and actuator (3) a wireless Tongue Display Unit (TDU) consisting of a circuit embedded in a dental retainer with electrodes put {{in contact with the}} tongue. The principle consists in (1) detecting overpressures in people who are seated over long periods of time, (2) estimating a postural change that could reduce these overpressures and (3) communicating this change through directional information transmitted by the TDU. Twenty-four healthy subjects voluntarily participated in this study. Twelve healthy subjects initially formed the experimental group (EG) and were seated on a chair with the wireless TDU inside their mouth. They were asked to follow TDU orders that were randomly spread throughout the session. They were evaluated during two experimental sessions during which 20 <b>electro-stimulations</b> were sent. Twelve other subjects, added retrospectively, formed the control group (CG). These subjects participated in one session of the same experiment without any biofeedback. Three dependent variables were computed: (1) the ability of subjects to reach target posture (EG versus CG), (2) high pressure reductions after a biofeedback (EG versus CG) and (3) the level of these reductions relative to their initial values (EG only). Results show (1) that EG reached target postures in 90. 2 % of the trials, against 5, 3 % in the CG, (2) a significant reduction in overpressures in the EG compared to the CG and (3), for the EG, that the higher the initial pressures were, the more they were decreased. The findings suggest that, in this trial, subjects were able to use a tongue tactile feedback system to reduce buttock overpressure while seated.

40|$|During the years, neuroprosthetic {{applications}} {{have obtained}} {{a great deal}} of attention by the international research, especially in the bioengineering field, thanks to the huge investments on several proposed projects funded by the political institutions which consider the treatment of this particular disease of fundamental importance for the global community. The aim of these projects is to find a possible solution to restore the functionalities lost by a patient subjected to an upper limb amputation trying to develop, according to physiological considerations, a communication link between the brain in which the significant signals are generated and a motor prosthesis device able to perform the desired action. Moreover, the designed system must be able to give back to the brain a sensory feedback about the surrounding world in terms of pressure or temperature acquired by tactile biosensors placed at the surface of the cybernetic hand. It in fact allows to execute involuntarymovements when for example the armcomes in contact with hot objects. The development of such a closed-loop architecture involves the need to address some critical issues which depend on the chosen approach. Several solutions have been proposed by the researches of the field, each one differing with respect to where the neural signals are acquired, either at the central nervous systemor at the peripheral one,most of themfollowing the former even that the latter is always considered by the amputees amore natural way to handle the artificial limb. This research work is based on the use of intrafascicular electrodes directly implanted in the residual peripheral nerves of the stump which represents a good compromise choice in terms of invasiveness and selectivity extracting electroneurographic (ENG) signals from which it is possible to identify the significant activity of a quite limited number of neuronal cells. In the perspective of the hardware implementation of the resulting solution which can work autonomously without any intervention by the amputee in an adaptive way according to the current characteristics of the processed signal and by using batteries as power source allowing portability, it is necessary to fulfill the tight constraints imposed by the application under consideration involved in each of the various phases which compose the considered closed-loop system. Regarding to the recording phase, the implementation must be able to remove the unwanted interferences mainly due to the <b>electro-stimulations</b> of themuscles placed near the electrodes featured by an order of magnitude much greater in comparison to that of the signals of interest amplifying the frequency components belonging to the significant bandwidth, and to convert them with a high resolution in order to obtain good performance at the next processing phases. To this aim, a recording module for peripheral neural signals will be presented, based on the use of a sigma-delta architecture which is composed by two main parts: an analog front-end stage for neural signal acquisition, pre-filtering and sigma-delta modulation and a digital unit for sigma-delta decimation and system configuration. Hardware/software cosimulations exploiting the Xilinx System Generator tool in Matlab Simulink environment and then transistor-level simulations confirmed that the system is capable of recording neural signals in the order of magnitude of tens of μV rejecting the huge low-frequency noise due to electromyographic interferences. The same architecture has been then exploited to implement a prototype of an 8 -channel implantable electronic bi-directional interface between the peripheral nervous system and the neuro-controlled hand prosthesis. The solution includes a custom designed Integrated Circuit (0. 35 μm CMOS technology), responsible of the signal pre-filtering and sigma-delta modulation for each channel and the neural stimuli generation (in the opposite path) based on the directives sent by a digital control systemmapped on a low-cost Xilinx FPGA Spartan- 3 E 1600 development board which also involves the multi-channel sigma-delta decimation with a high-order band-pass filter as first stage in order to totally remove the unwanted interferences. In this way, the analog chip can be implanted near the electrodes thanks to its limited size avoiding to add a huge noise to theweak neural signals due to longwires connections and to cause heat-related infections, shifting the complexity to the digital part which can be hosted on a separated device in the stump of the amputeewithout using complex laboratory instrumentations. The system has been successfully tested from the electrical point of view and with in-vivo experiments exposing good results in terms of output resolution and noise rejection even in case of critical conditions. The various output channels at the Nyquist sampling frequency coming from the acquisition system must be processed in order to decode the intentions of movements of the amputee, applying the correspondent electro-mechanical stimulation in input to the cybernetic hand in order to perform the desired motor action. Different decoding approaches have been presented in the past, the majority of them were conceived starting from the relative implementation and performance evaluation of their off-line version. At the end of the research, it is necessary to develop these solutions on embedded systems performing an online processing of the peripheral neural signals. However, it is often possible only by using complex hardware platforms clocked at very high operating frequencies which are not be compliant with the low-power requirements needed to allow portability for the prosthetic device. At present, in fact, the important aspect of the real-time implementation of sophisticated signal processing algorithms on embedded systems has been often overlooked, notwithstanding the impact that limited resources of the former may have on the efficiency/effectiveness of any given algorithm. In this research work it has been addressed the optimization of a state-of-the-art algorithmfor PNS signals decoding that is a step forward for its real-time, full implementation onto a floating-point Digital Signal Processor (DSP). Beyond low-level optimizations, different solutions have been proposed at an high level in order to find the best trade-off in terms of effectiveness/efficiency. A latency model, obtained through cycle accurate profiling of the different code sections, has been drawn in order to perform a fair performance assessment.

40|$|The visual {{substitution}} paradigm aims {{to facilitate}} the life of blind people. Generally one uses electro-stimulating devices where electrodes are arranged into arrays to stimulate the skin or the tongue mucosa to send signals of visual type to the subjects. When an <b>electro-stimulation</b> signal is applied continuously (e. g. when static visual scenes are displayed {{for a long period}} of time), the receptors of the affected region can get saturated and the patient may lose the displayed information. We propose here some mechanisms that ameliorate the quality of perception of the <b>electro-stimulation</b> information. The electrical signal is encoded as 2 D scenes projected onto the tongue via a Tongue Display Unit, i. e. an electro-tactile stimulator formed by a 12 x 12 matrix of electrodes.

Our assumption is that this eye-inspired mechanism should make the visual substitution more efficient (by improving the perception) because of the reduction of the tactile receptors saturation. The influence of saccades was evaluated by a series of experiments. Results revealed a benefit on the persistence of perception due to saccades.

The expressions of Akt, GSK 3, and PKCε expression were analyzed byWestern blotting. When RES was preconditioned before the I/R model, the rat's hemodynamic index, infarction size, mortality and serum CK-MBwere evaluated. Our results showed that Akt, GSK 3 and PKCε expression levels were significantly increased in the RES group compared to the sham group, which were blocked by pretreatment with spe...|$|E
40|$|We {{have read}} the article {{entitled}} ‘Probabilistic map of critical functional regions of the human cerebral cortex: Broca’s area revisited ’ by Tate et al. (2014) with great interest. In that art-icle, the authors presented a bilateral probabilistic map for the essential functions by integrating {{the data from the}} ‘gold standard ’ for mapping brain functions (direct cortical <b>electro-stimulation)</b> in a large set of patients. In particular, the authors’ findings challenged two aspects of the classical theories of brain organization. First, their data added new and more dir-ect evidence for the theory that the ventral premotor cortex (PMC), not the classical Broca’s area (Bizzi et al., 2012), is the speech output region. Second, these authors reported that the crucial epicentres for speech output were not lateralized to the dominant hemispheres. A bilateral cortical requirement for speech output was demonstrated in this article. These result...|$|E
