50|$|Treatment {{is usually}} surgical, {{performed}} at the insertional ends of extraocular muscles (where they attach to the globe). Resection surgery removes tissue in order to stretch a muscle, increasing its elastic force; recession moves an insertion so as to reduce stretch, and so reduce elastic force; transposition moves an insertion “sideways”, sacrificing one direction of muscle action for another; posterior fixation relocates a muscle’s effective insertion to a mechanically disadvantageous position. All are kinds of compensatory impairment. Pharmacologic <b>injection</b> <b>treatments,</b> in contrast, offer the possibility of directly increasing or decreasing contractile muscle strength and elastic stiffness, as well as changing muscle length, without removing tissue or otherwise compromising orbital mechanics.|$|E
50|$|Ophthalmologists {{specializing in}} eye muscle {{disorders}} (strabismus) had developed {{the method of}} EMG-guided injection (using the electromyogram, the electrical signal from an activated muscle, to guide injection) of local anesthetics as a diagnostic technique for evaluating an individual muscle’s contribution to an eye movement. Because strabismus surgery frequently needed repeating, a search was undertaken for non-surgical, <b>injection</b> <b>treatments</b> using various anesthetics, alcohols, enzymes, enzyme blockers, and snake neurotoxins. Finally, inspired by Daniel Drachman’s work with chicks at Johns Hopkins, Alan B Scott and colleagues injected botulinum toxin into monkey extraocular muscles. The result was remarkable: a few picograms induced paralysis that was confined to the target muscle, long in duration, and without side-effects.|$|E

50|$|Pharmacologic <b>injection</b> <b>treatments</b> can {{be given}} to {{cooperative}} adults under local anesthesia in an outpatient setting, and for some agents, under light general anesthesia. In the former case, {{it is possible to}} bring the injection needle to an optimal location in the desired muscle using EMG guidance as the alert patient looks in diagnostic directions, the needle is advanced until the electromyogram (the electrical signal from an activated skeletal muscle) indicates it is optimally positioned, whereupon the injection is completed. Some agents (e.g., botulinum toxin) can be injected at the insertional end of a muscle under visual guidance, using special forceps and allowed to diffuse posteriorly, whereas others (e.g., bupivacaine) must be distributed throughout the body of the muscle, which requires non-visual guidance. EMG guidance generally provides more effective injections, but is only suitable for alert, cooperative adults. Because injection treatment does not result in the scaring that is often a troublesome consequence of conventional strabismus surgery, if therapeutic goals are not achieved with one injection, additional injections or surgical treatments can readily be given.|$|E

The {{aim of this}} systematic review is to describe the different <b>injection</b> <b>treatments,</b> their rationales {{and the effectiveness of}} treating patellar tendinopathy. Methods A computerised search of the Medline, Embase, CINAHL and Web of Knowledge databases was conducted on 1 May 2010 to identify studies on <b>injection</b> <b>treatments</b> for patellar tendinopathy. Results 11 articles on seven different <b>injection</b> <b>treatments</b> (dry needling, autologous blood, high-volume, platelet-rich plasma, sclerosis, steroids and aprotinin injections) were found: 4 randomised controlled trials (RCTs), 1 non-RCT, 4 prospective cohort studies and 2 retrospective cohort studies.

40|$|Tennis elbow (TE) is a {{relatively}} common painful condition affecting the upper extremity. The aetiology is not known, but TE is most often seen in middle aged individuals using repetitive and forceful gripping at work or recreational activities, and is referred to overuse injuries. The pathogenesis is not known, but there are so-called degenerative changes in the wrist- and finger-extensor muscle origin (common extensor origin - CEO). The pain mechanisms involved have not been scientifically clarified. The studies in the present thesis aimed to 1) evaluate the structure and blood flow using ultrasound (US) and colour Doppler (CD) examinations of the CEO in patients with TE, and in pain-free elbows, 2) evaluate the clinical effects of US- and CD-guided intratendinous <b>injection</b> <b>treatment</b> with the sclerosing substance polidocanol, 3) evaluate the long term (2 years) effects of <b>injection</b> <b>treatment</b> on the tendon structure and blood flow, and 4) investigate {{if there is a}} local production of sympathetic and parasympathetic signal substances in non-neural cells in the CEO. Structural tendon changes and high blood flow was found in the CEO in patients with TE, but not in pain-free controls. Remaining structural changes and additional bone spur formation at the lateral epicondyle, but not high blood flow, were seen 2 years after successful <b>injection</b> <b>treatment.</b> In a randomised double-blind study, US- and CD-guided intratendinous <b>injection</b> <b>treatment</b> with sclerosing polidocanol or the local anaesthetic lidocaine combined with epinephrine, targeting the region with high blood flow, was found to reduce pain and increase grip strength in patients with TE. There were no differences in the outcome between the two treatment groups. A local production of catecholamines, but not acetylcholine, was found in fibroblasts in the CEO, in patients with TE. This thesis presents results showing US and CD examinations to be useful methods to diagnose TE, and to evaluate structure and blood flow in the CEO after treatment. US- and CD-guided <b>injection</b> <b>treatment</b> targeting high blood flow in the region with structural changes can reduce pain symptoms in patients with TE. The localised high blood flow, and local production of catecholamines in the tendon cells in the CEO, might be involved in the pain mechanisms...|$|R

The aim of this non-randomized study is to compare the effect of lateral internal sphincterotomy and botulinum toxin <b>injection</b> <b>treatments</b> on the outcome and reduction of anal sphincter pressures in patients with chronic anal fissure. Methods Patients with chronic anal fissure were treated with either botulinum toxin injection or lateral internal sphincterotomy by their own choice. Maximal resting pressure and maximal squeeze pressure measurements were performed before and 2 weeks after treatments by anal manometry. Patients were followed for fissure relapse during 14 months. Results Twenty-one consecutive outpatients with posterior chronic anal fissure were enrolled. Eleven patients underwent surgery and ten patients received botulinum toxin injection treatment. Before the treatment, anal pressures were found to be similar in both groups. After the treatment, the maximal resting pressures were reduced from 104 ± 22 mmHg to 86 ± 15 mmHg in the surgery group (p 0. 05) in the surgery group, and from 117 ± 62 mmHg to 76 ± 34 (p 0. 05).

Of these, 173 patients had 343 variceal bleeds which required balloon tamponade to achieve initial control of bleeding during 229 admissions and were then referred for emergency injection sclerotherapy. Sixty-eight percent of these patients had alcoholic cirrhosis and 42 % were poor risk Grade C patients. Injection sclerotherapy was performed initially using the rigid Negus oesophagoscope under general anaesthesia and later using the fibreoptic endoscope under light sedation. Definitive control of variceal bleeding was achieved with sclerotherapy during 197 hospital admissions (92 %). Of the 17 failures of emergency sclerotherapy, 4 patients died from uncontrolled bleeding and 13 patients underwent major surgical intervention. Definitive control of variceal bleeding was achieved with a single injection treatment in 138 hospital admissions (70 %).

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of induced {{embolism}} with air <b>injection</b> <b>treatments</b> on the function of xylem in Acer rubrum L. and Salix nigra Marsh. Measurements made on mature trees of A. rubrum showed that pneumatic pressurization treatments that created a pressure gradient of 5. 5 MPa across pit membranes (DPpit) had no effect on stomatal conductance or on branch-level sap flow. The same air <b>injection</b> <b>treatments</b> made on three year old potted A. rubrum plants also had no effect on whole plant transpiration. A separate study made on mature A. rubrum trees showed that 3. 0 and 5. 5 MPa of DPpit values resulted in an immediate 100 % loss in hydraulic conductance (PLC) in petioles. However, the observed change in PLC was short lived and significant hydraulic recovery occurred within 5 - 10 minutes post air pressurization treatments. Similar experiments conducted on S. nigra plants exposed to DPpit of 3 MPa resulted in a rapid decline in whole plant transpiration followed by leaf wilting and eventual plant death, showing that this species lacks the ability to recover from induced embolism. A survey that measured the effect of air-pressurization treatments on seven other species showed that some species are very sensitive to induction of embolism resulting in leaf wilting and branch death while others show minimal to no effect despite that in each case, the applied DPpit of 5. 5 MPa significantly exceeded any native stress that these plants would experience naturally...|$|E

Participants: Chinese women aged 14 – 25 years with severe primary dysmenorrhoea for at least 6 months not relieved by any other treatment were recruited. Exclusion criteria were the use of oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices or anticoagulant drugs, pregnancy, history of abdominal surgery, participation in other therapies for pain and diagnosis of secondary dysmenorrhoea. Eighty patients with primary dysmenorrhoea, as defined on a 4 -grade scale, completed the study. Two patients withdrew after randomisation. Interventions: A double-blind, double-dummy, randomised controlled trial compared vitamin K 3 acupuncture point injection to saline acupuncture point injection and vitamin K 3 deep muscle injection. Patients in each group received 3 injections at a single treatment visit. Primary and secondary outcome measures: The primary outcome was the difference in subjective perception of pain as measured by an 11 unit Numeric Rating Scale (NRS). Secondary measurements were Cox Pain Intensity and Duration scales and the consumption of analgesic tablets before and after treatment and during 6 following cycles. Results: Patients in all 3 groups experienced pain relief from the <b>injection</b> <b>treatments.</b> Differences in NRS measured mean pain scores between the 2 active control groups were less than 1 unit (− 0. 71, CI − 1. 37 to − 0. 05) and not significant, but the differences in average scores between the treatment hypothesised to be optimal and both active control groups (1. 11, CI 0. 45 to 1. 78) and (1. 82, CI 1. 45 to 2. 49) were statistically significant in adjusted mixed-effects models.
