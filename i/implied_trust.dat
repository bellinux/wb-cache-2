25|$|Trusts may {{be created}} by the {{expressed}} intentions of the settlor (express trusts) or they may {{be created by}} operation of law known as implied trusts. An <b>implied</b> <b>trust</b> is one created by a court of equity because of acts or situations of the parties. Implied trusts are divided into two categories: resulting and constructive. A resulting trust is implied by the law to work out the presumed intentions of the parties, but it does not take into consideration their expressed intent. A constructive trust is a trust implied by law to work out justice between the parties, regardless of their intentions.|$|E
25|$|Implied trust: An <b>implied</b> <b>trust,</b> as {{distinct}} from an express trust, is created {{where some of the}} legal requirements for an express trust are not met, but an intention on behalf of the parties to create a trust can be presumed to exist. A resulting trust may be deemed to be present where a trust instrument is not properly drafted and a portion of the equitable title has not been provided for. In such a case, the law may raise a resulting trust {{for the benefit of the}} grantor (the creator of the trust). In other words, the grantor may be deemed to be a beneficiary of the portion of the equitable title that was not properly provided for in the trust document.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Digital {{signatures}} {{and message}} authentication codes {{are well known}} methods for ensuring message integrity. However, they rely on computations which are too hard to be performed by humans and are instead done on computers. Trusting a digital signature <b>implies</b> <b>trusting</b> the computer which produced/checked it. Often, this trust cannot be taken for granted. This paper presents a method for visual authentication of large messages which relies on embedding a human-recognizable watermark and needs practically no computational power on the receiver side. Also, using a simple challenge-response mechanism is proposed to prevent attackers from obtaining signatures without author’s knowledge. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} key escrow/key {{recovery}} schemes {{was introduced to}} overcome the perceived problems of law enforcement agencies when criminal elements protect their transmissions with cryptography. It was argued that such law enforcement agencies must {{have the potential for}} real time access to all cryptographic keys used for such privacy purposes, {{in order to ensure that}} criminal activities may be monitored, usually under appropriate court orders, and to thus allow such agencies to fulfil their respective charters. The concept met with significant opposition, on both civil liberty and technical grounds. One major concern is that cryptography is not merely used to hide confidential data, it is now widely used for personal and system authentication in addition to non repudiation of electronic transactions. The ubiquitous public key cipher RSA may thus be employed to encrypt a message, or encrypt a symmetric cipher’s secret key, e. g. DES key, which in turns encrypts a message, or authenticate the user to a host system or electronically sign a transaction. Handing over one’s RSA secret key to a public official not only <b>implies</b> <b>trusting</b> that official not to misuse the knowledge of secret transmissions, it also <b>implies</b> <b>trusting</b> that official not to masquerade as oneself to computer systems, and not to misuse one’s digital signature. The problem arises because in public key cryptography the private key, usually known only to its owner, may serve two functions: decryption of an encrypted message sent to th...|$|R

40|$|Authorizing or {{auditing}} – national {{tests as}} a governing tool NPM, {{particularly in the}} form of output evaluations, have had a large impact on Swedish educational reforms over the past decades. This article focuses on the governing of schools and the professional status of teachers by examining how teachers have experienced the new national tests, introduced in compulsory schools in 2014 in social study subjects. Two ideal types of governing, authorizing and auditing, provide the theoretical framework. The empirical material consists of focus group interviews. The results expose a tension in teacher experience. On the one hand, the teachers feel validated by the tests; on the other, they oppose the questioning of their profession that the tests <b>imply.</b> <b>Trust</b> is a key factor at play. The current way Swedish schools are governed signals a distrust in teachers. At the same time, the teachers display a significant level of trust in the state, combined with a limited professional confidence. This reinforces the status of teaching as a semi-profession. ...|$|R
5000|$|Proprietary {{estoppel}} {{is one of}} four principal {{mechanisms to}} acquire rights over property, seen particularly in the case of land (the others being a contract, an <b>implied</b> <b>trust,</b> and adverse possession). Unlike a contract or gift, which depend on consent, or resulting and constructive trusts that depend primarily on the fact of contribution, a proprietary estoppel arises when a person has been given a clear assurance, it was reasonable of them to rely on the assurance, and they have acted to their detriment. This threefold pattern of proprietary estoppel (clear assurance, reasonable reliance and substantial detriment) makes it consistent with its partner in the law of obligations, [...] "promissory estoppel".|$|E

5000|$|A {{resulting}} trust (from the Latin 'resalire' meaning 'to jump back') {{is the creation}} of an <b>implied</b> <b>trust</b> by operation of law, where property is transferred to someone who pays nothing for it; and then is implied to have held the property for benefit of another person. The trust property is said to [...] "result" [...] back to the transferor (implied settlor).

Although {{there are some}} controversies {{about the possibility of}} extending the concept of trust to trust in institutions, {{it is also important to}} pay attention to these relationships between individuals in the context of different institutional settings. In the markets, or in the political arena people use to interact with different kind of organizations, like enterprises and governmental bureaucracies. Those interactions <b>imply</b> <b>trust</b> like interactions between individuals in absence of an institutional framework. I assume that the interaction individual-organization is asymmetric in vertical organizations by contrast with horizontal networks. Nevertheless, organizations need to generate trust as a mean to secure the future value of the relationships. In the model, the degree of asymmetry between organizations and individuals depends on the extent that the organization posses valuable resources to the individual. The degree of asymmetry in turn affects the behavior into the organization and the expectations the individuals about the organization...|$|R
40|$|The most {{intuitive}} way {{to build}} a service directory application that allows for service entities to register or search for services {{on top of a}} structured peer-topeer network is to build reverse indices at appropriate nodes on the network. However, this <b>implies</b> <b>trust</b> on the reliability and integrity of other nodes on the network, which may be too risky an assumption for businesses. This paper proposes a service directory that groups service entities of the same category together; this is achieved by dedicating part of the node identifiers to correspond to their service category semantic. Using Chord as the peer-to-peer substrate, this scheme logically divides the Chord circle into equidistant arcs; each arc is called an island. This scheme will result in the formation of islands of varying population, and thus changing the uniformly spread topology of the original Chord. Simulations are used to investigate the path length and message load of the changed topology. An additional routing scheme is also proposed and simulated to exploit the new topology to gain better path length...|$|R

40|$|Trust is {{a central}} {{dimension}} in the relation between human beings and technologies. In many discourses about technology, the relation between human beings and technologies is conceptualized as an external relation: a relation between pre-given entities that {{can have an impact}} on each other but that do not mutually constitute each other. From this perspective, relations of trust can vary between reliance, as is present for instance in technological extensionism, and suspicion, as in various precautionary approaches in ethics that focus on technological risks. Against these two interpretations of trust, this article develops a third one. Based on a more internal account of the relations between human beings and technologies, it becomes possible to see that every technological development puts at stake {{what it means to be}} a human being. Using technologies, then, <b>implies</b> <b>trusting</b> ourselves to technologies. We argue that this does not imply an uncritical subjection to technology. Rather, recognizing that technologies help to constitute human subjectivity implies that human beings can get actively involved in processes of technological mediation. Trust then has the character of confidence: deliberately trusting oneself to technology. Values and TechnologyTechnology, Policy and Managemen...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) {{is a kind}} of {{wireless}} ad-hoc network. It is a self-configuring network of mobile nodes connected by wireless links, without the aid of any fixed infrastructure or centralized administration. Nodes within their wireless transmitter ranges can communicate with each other directly, while nodes outside the range rely on other nodes to relay messages resulting in a multi-hop scenario. As the low transmission power of each node limits its communication range, the nodes must assist and trust each other before getting involved into a real communication. However, this <b>implied</b> <b>trust</b> relationship can be threatened by malicious nodes. So far the majority of research work has been done to achieve a secure routing infrastructure, assuming the existence of an efficient node authentication mechanism which in turn is part of a key management scheme. This paper will analyze previous work and then present a new node authentication mechanism which is fully distributed and has the ability to self-organize with out the requirement of any online trusted third party.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the role of}} business familiarity in determining how software development outsourcing projects are managed and priced to address risks. Increased business familiarity suggests both more prior knowledge, and hence reduced adverse selection risk, and increased <b>implied</b> <b>trust</b> about future behavior, and hence implied reduced moral hazard risk. Preferring high business familiarity partners may also alleviate concerns about incomplete contracts. By reducing these risks, higher business familiarity is hypothesized {{to be associated with}} higher priced projects, reduced penalties, and an increased tendency to contract on a time and materials rather than a fixed price basis. These hypotheses were examined with objective contractual legal data from contracts made by a leading international bank. Integrating trust theory into agency theory and into incomplete contract theory and examining unique contract data, the contribution of the study is to show that the premium on business familiarity and the trust it implies is not in directly affecting price, but, rather, in changing how the relationship is managed toward a tendency to sign time and materials contracts. Implications about integrating trust into agency theory and incomplete contract theory, as well as implications regarding trust premiums and software development outsourcing, are discussed...|$|E
