The farm fishes were competitively and reproductively inferior, achieving less than one-third the breeding success of the native fishes. Moreover, this inferiority was sex biased, being more pronounced in farm males than females, resulting in the principal route of gene flow involving native males mating with farm females. There were also indications of selection against farm genotypes during early survival but not thereafter. However, evidence of resource competition and competitive displacement existed as the productivity of the native population was depressed by more than 30 %. Ultimately, the lifetime reproductive success (adult to adult) of the farm fishes was 16 % that of the native salmon.

40|$|Abstract Infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) virus (ISAV) {{has been}} causing disease in New Brunswick since 1996. As a control measure, all fish in an {{outbreak}} cage are killed. The {{objective of this}} study was to compare ISAV prevalence in cages experiencing an outbreak with healthy cages from the same farm, neighbouring farms and distant <b>farms.</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>salmon</b> from five different groups were tested using an RT-PCR test. Groups included moribund fish from a cage experiencing an outbreak (A), healthy fish from an outbreak cage (B), healthy fish from a negative cage from a farm experiencing an outbreak in a different cage (C), healthy fish from a negative farm near an outbreak farm (D), and healthy fish sampled at a negative farm located in an area with only negative farms (E). Apparent prevalences (standard error) for the different groups (A-E) were 0. 94 (+/- 0. 026), 0. 41 (+/- 0. 062), 0. 29 (+/- 0. 040), 0. 08 (+/- 0. 037) and 0. 08 (+/- 0. 037), respectively. All groups were significantly different (P < 0. 002) from each other except for groups B and C and groups D and E. Because the prevalence of the virus was significantly higher in the outbreak cage (B) compared with other sites, early harvest of outbreak cages will remove one source of virus. However, ISA negative cages (C) that remain on the positive farm may potentially act as a viral reservoir.

40|$|Feral animals {{represent}} an important problem in many ecosystems due to interbreeding with wild conspecifics. Hybrid offspring from wild and domestic parents are often less adapted to local environment and ultimately, {{can reduce the}} fitness of the native population. This problem is an important concern in Norway, where each year, {{hundreds of thousands of}} <b>farm</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>salmon</b> escape from fish farms. Feral fish outnumber wild populations, leading to a possible loss of local adaptive genetic variation and erosion of genetic structure in wild populations. Studying the genetic factors underlying relative performance between wild and domesticated conspecific can help to better understand how domestication modifies the genetic background of populations, and how it may alter their ability to adapt to the natural environment. Here, based upon a large-scale release of wild, farm and wild x farm salmon crosses into a natural river system, a genome-wide quantitative trait locus (QTL) scan was performed on the offspring of 50 full-sib families, for traits related to fitness (length, weight, condition factor and survival). Six QTLs were detected as significant contributors to the phenotypic variation of the first three traits, explaining collectively between 9. 8 and 14. 8 % of the phenotypic variation. The seventh QTL had a significant contribution to the variation in survival, and is regarded as a key factor to understand the fitness variability observed among salmon in the river.

50|$|One of {{the primary}} {{concerns}} with mariculture {{is the potential for}} disease and parasite transfer. Farmed stocks are often selectively bred to increase disease and parasite resistance, as well as improving growth rates and quality of products. As a consequence, the genetic diversity within reared stocks decreases with every generation - meaning they can potentially reduce the genetic diversity within wild populations if they escape into those wild populations. Such genetic pollution from escaped aquaculture stock can reduce the wild population’s ability to adjust to the changing natural environment. Also, maricultured species can harbour diseases and parasites (e.g., lice) which can be introduced to wild populations upon their escape. An example of this is the parasitic sea lice on wild and <b>farmed</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>salmon</b> in Canada. Also, non-indigenous species which are farmed may have resistance to, or carry, particular diseases (which they picked up in their native habitats) which could be spread through wild populations if they escape into those wild populations. Such ‘new’ diseases would be devastating for those wild populations because they would have no immunity to them.|$|E
40|$|The {{infectious}} salmon anemia (ISA) virus causes lethargy, anemia, hemorrhage of {{the internal}} organs, and death in <b>farmed</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>salmon</b> Salmo salar.

Wild fish have been proposed as a viral reservoir because {{they are capable of}} close contact with farmed salmon. Laboratory studies have shown that brown trout and sea trout Salmo trutta, rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, and herring Clupea harengus tested positive for the virus weeks after intra-peritoneal injection of the ISA virus. Pollock Pollachius virens are commonly found in and around salmon cages, and their close association with the salmon makes them an important potential viral reservoir to consider.

40|$|Infectious salmon anaemia (ISA) virus {{causes a}} severe, commercially {{significant}} disease in all countries <b>farming</b> <b>Atlantic</b> <b>salmon</b> (Salmo salar). This thesis examines the ISA epizootic in Chile during 2007 - 09, {{known as the}} “ISA crisis”. Three important questions were addressed. First, how did the ISA virus arrive in Chile? Second, how was the virus spread within the industry after arrival? And third, {{what would be the}} best preventive measures to control the spread of this virus? Phylogenetic comparison of ISA virus from Chile with all available ISA virus strains showed a close relationship to European ISA virus. The best explanation for this observation is that the ISA virus arrived in Chile with its natural host, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>salmon</b> – through import of embryos. Once in Chile the ISA virus spread rapidly due to the industrial and sanitary practices such as the continuous productions in both freshwater lakes and at sea sites with no generational splits, and movement of fish between sites. At some sites the salmon were weakened due to high stocking densities and the presence of additional pathogens. It was found that the sea louse, Caligus rogercresseyi could act as a mechanical vector, and possibly contributed to the spread of the virus. In contrast, the survival time of ISA virions in natural sea water was found to be less than three hours (under experimental conditions), and therefore waterborne transmission over long distances was considered to be unlikely. In addition, ISA mortalities were contagious for up to five days post mortem, emphasizing the importance of dead fish removal. ISA virus is present in the natural wild reservoir of S. salar and S. trutta in the North Atlantic. However, both in Chile and Norway {{it is likely that the}} farming industry accommodate a self-sustaining reservoir of ISA virus. Thus the industry has a possibility to reduce the prevalence by pathogen monitoring and elimination of positive broodfish. Good surveillance programmes can predict ISA outbreaks, and site management can diminish the significance of ISA outbreaks. The key for this is tracing the pathogen throughout the production cycle and implementing appropriate preventative measures, instead of waiting for clinical symptoms to appear and then activate the associated “fire fighting” approach. </p...|$|R
