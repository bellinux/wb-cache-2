5|$|In {{selecting}} Ved Vejen for the Danish Culture Canon, {{the selection}} committee {{operating under the}} Danish Ministry of Culture explained that the attraction {{of the novel is}} that it portrays with considerable empathy how a meek young woman becomes increasingly aware of desires she <b>hardly</b> <b>knew</b> she possessed. With bittersweet irony, the author allows Katinka to develop her infatuation by listening to the heartaches of others. With its almost cinematic sequences, the novel conveys a balance between its subdued humour and a strong sympathy for what goes on in people's minds, especially in a secluded environment removed from mainstream society. It is not just Bang's portrayal of a bygone provincial world that seems so typically Danish but his mastery in making the hidden pain of loneliness so meaningful to today's readership. In 1988 it was made into a feature film Katinka, directed by Max von Sydow, starring Tammi Øst as Katinka.|$|E

Individuals that had confided in the prior version of the CAN organization expressed anxiety about their confidential files being sold to other groups, but Moxon stated: [...] "People who have committed crimes don't want them to be revealed." [...] Moxon's former legal associate, Scientologist Steven Hayes, purchased the assets of the Cult Awareness Network in bankruptcy court. In 2000, Moxon co-authored a paper on the Cult Awareness Network with Anson D. Shupe and Susan E. Darnell.

500|$|His {{father had}} again turned his {{attention}} to horse breeding and in 1861 brought his champion horse, Croagh Patrick, to England for a successful racing season, together with his wife and nine-year-old son. For a while George was left at Cliff's stables until his father decided to send George to his alma mater facilitated by his winnings. Moore's formal education started at St. Mary's College, Oscott, a Catholic boarding school near Birmingham where he was the youngest of 150 boys. He spent all of 1864 at home, having contracted a lung infection brought about by a breakdown in his health. His academic performance was poor while he was hungry and unhappy. In January 1865, he returned to St. Mary's College with his brother Maurice, where he refused to study as instructed and spent time reading novels and poems. That December the principal, Spencer Northcote, wrote a report that: [...] "he <b>hardly</b> <b>knew</b> what to say about George." [...] By the summer of 1867 he was expelled, for (in his own words) 'idleness and general worthlessness', and returned to Mayo.|$|E

500|$|When he {{returned}} to the topic of the Crucifixion eleven years later, he retained some of the stylistic elements he had developed earlier, such as the elongated and dislocated organic forms that he now based on Oresteia. He continued to incorporate the spatial device he was to use many times throughout his career—three lines radiating from this central figure, which was first seen in Crucifixion, 1933. Three Studies was painted over the course of two weeks in 1944, when, Bacon recalled, [...] "I was in a bad mood of drinking, and I did it under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes <b>hardly</b> <b>knew</b> what I was doing. I think perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer." [...] The painting was executed in a ground-floor flat at 7 Cromwell Place, South Kensington in London. A large back room in the building had been converted into a billiard room by its previous occupant, artist John Everett Millais. It was Bacon's studio by day; at night, abetted by Eric Hall and Bacon's childhood nanny Jessie Lightfoot, it functioned as an illicit casino.|$|E
500|$|Edward's {{youngest}} brother, Prince John, {{died at the}} age of 13 on 18 January 1919 after {{a severe}} seizure. John suffered from epilepsy, and Edward, who was 11 years older than his brother and had hardly known him, saw his death as [...] "little more than a regrettable nuisance". He wrote to his mistress of the time that [...] " [...] told [...] all about that little brother, and how he was an epileptic. 's been practically shut up for the last two years anyhow, so no one has ever seen him except the family, and then only once or twice a year. This poor boy had become more of an animal than anything else." [...] He also wrote an insensitive letter to Queen Mary, which has since been lost. She did not reply, but he felt compelled to write her an apology, in which he stated: [...] "I feel such a cold hearted and unsympathetic swine for writing all that I did... No one can realize more than you how little poor Johnnie meant to me who <b>hardly</b> <b>knew</b> him... I feel so much for you, darling Mama, who was his mother." ...|$|E
500|$|Bacon {{said that}} chance played a {{significant}} role in his work, and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge. This was especially the case in the mid- to late 1940s, a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in Soho casinos and poker rooms. The following morning he would often approach his canvas [...] "in a bad mood of drinking... under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes <b>hardly</b> <b>knew</b> what I was doing." [...] He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work: an image often would morph midway through into something quite different from what he had first intended. He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist. To him, lifestyle and art were intertwined; he said that [...] "perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit freer." [...] This is very evident in the 1949 series, which began as a rather morbid study of a collapsed head, but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of Velázquez masterpieces, and arrived at an image that was to preoccupy Bacon for the subsequent 20 years.|$|E

500|$|Brian Donlevy as Professor Bernard Quatermass: Donlevy reprised {{his role}} as the eponymous professor, much to the despair of Nigel Kneale, who had heavily criticised his {{interpretation}} of the role in The Quatermass Xperiment. As had been the case on The Quatermass Xperiment, Donlevy's alcoholism presented challenges for the production. Nigel Kneale recalled visiting the set one day: “He [...] was so full of whiskey he could hardly stand up. He staggered over to the set and looked dazedly around. They held up an idiot board with his lines on and he said, “What's this movie called?” and they said, “Well, it's called Quatermass 2”. He said, “I've got to say all that? There's too much talk. Cut down some of the talk”. He tried to read it and he had to have go after go after go, so crippled with drink he <b>hardly</b> <b>knew</b> who he was”. Val Guest has denied Kneale's claims, saying “So many stories have been concocted since, about how he was a paralytic. It's absolute balls, because he was not paralytic. He wasn't stone cold sober either, but he was a pro and he knew his lines”. Guest also recalled, “By after lunch he would come to me and say “Give me a breakdown of the story so far. Where have I just been before this scene?” We used to feed him black coffee all morning but then we discovered he was lacing it. But he was a very professional actor and very easy to work with”.|$|E

He did not understand maps, <b>hardly</b> <b>knew</b> how to sign his name, and did not once approach within cannon shot of the rebels; in a word, there was nothing comparable to his poltroonery and his inefficiency, except his arrogance, his brutality, and his obstinacy". Marceau's biographer Thomas George Johnson called Léchelle, [...] "pompous and inexperienced".|$|E

[...] While this statement appears paradoxical, it reflects Gandhi's complex feelings toward her gender and feminism. Her egalitarian upbringing with her cousins helped contribute to her sense of natural equality.

2500|$|Throughout the 18th century, the watchword of translators was ease of reading. Whatever {{they did}} not {{understand}} in a text, or thought might bore readers, they omitted. They cheerfully assumed that their own style of expression was the best, and that texts {{should be made to}} conform to it in translation. For scholarship they cared no more than had their predecessors, and {{they did not}} shrink from making translations from translations in third languages, or from languages that they <b>hardly</b> <b>knew,</b> or—as in the case of James Macpherson's [...] "translations" [...] of Ossian—from texts that were actually of the [...] "translator's" [...] own composition.|$|E
