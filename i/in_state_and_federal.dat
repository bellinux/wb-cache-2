5|$|Though {{based on}} a technicality, the Blyew case set a {{precedent}} <b>in</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> courts {{that led to the}} erosion of Congress's Thirteenth Amendment powers. The Supreme Court continued along this path in the Slaughter-House Cases (1873), which upheld a state-sanctioned monopoly of white butchers. In United States v. Cruikshank (1876), the Court ignored Thirteenth Amendment dicta from a circuit court decision to exonerate perpetrators of the Colfax massacre and invalidate the Enforcement Act of 1870.|$|E
5|$|The {{legality}} of Virginia's confiscation of the Northern Neck Proprietary lands {{continued to be}} contested <b>in</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> courts long after Denny Fairfax's death in 1800. The Virginia Supreme Court upheld the state's confiscation and conveyance of the proprietary's lands, arguing that {{the terms of the}} Jay Treaty with the Kingdom of Great Britain did not address the disputed proprietary. In 1813, the United States Supreme Court reviewed the Virginia Supreme Court's decision in Fairfax's Devisee v. Hunter's Lessee, 11 U.S. 603, and ruled that the treaty did in fact cover the dispute, and remanded the case back to the state supreme court. The Virginia Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. Supreme Court did not have authority over cases originating in state courts. The state supreme court's refusal to accept the U.S. Supreme Court's mandate was appealed in 1816 in Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 14 U.S. 304. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed the state court's decision on appeal and ruled that Article Three of the United States Constitution granted the U.S. Supreme Court jurisdiction and authority over state courts on matters involving federal law. Chief Justice John Marshall was forced to recuse himself from ruling in Martin v. Hunter's Lessee as he and his brother James had previously contracted with Denny Fairfax to purchase the disputed proprietary lands.|$|E

25|$|The $500 million ten-year {{contract}} between UC Berkeley, the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and BP (formerly BP Amoco), {{one of the}} world's largest energy production companies, officially went into effect Wednesday November 14, 2007 following approval {{by a majority of}} the faculty. The grant is the largest in the University's history. The deal has garnered criticism from some students and faculty who claim the agreement was negotiated in secret, and that it threatens Berkeley's reputation as an autonomous and democratic institution of higher learning. Supporters of the deal, on the other hand, assert that the infusion of capital from the venture will benefit the campus as a whole at a time when public universities are dealing with increasing cuts <b>in</b> <b>State</b> <b>and</b> <b>Federal</b> funding. They also point out that the BP deal focuses on developing alternative energy, an important issue in today's world.|$|E

500|$|The shuttle ran at {{all times}} until September 10, 1995, when night service was {{discontinued}} {{in order to avoid}} raising fares, meaning that late-night passengers must use the [...] train. New York City Transit had been expecting a $160 million surplus in 1995, but due to reductions <b>in</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>Federal</b> contributions, it was left with a deficit which could reach $172 million.

500|$|Attempts {{to correct}} {{phosphorus}} {{levels in the}} Everglades met with resistance. The sugarcane industry, dominated by two companies named U.S. Sugar and Flo-Sun, was responsible {{for more than half}} of the crop in the EAA. They were well represented <b>in</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> governments by lobbyists who enthusiastically protected their interests. According to the Audubon Society, the sugar industry, nicknamed [...] "Big Sugar", donated more money to political parties and candidates than General Motors. The sugar industry attempted to block government-funded studies of polluted water, and when the federal prosecutor in Miami faulted the sugar industry in legal action to protect Everglades National Park, Big Sugar tried to get the lawsuit withdrawn and the prosecutor fired. A costly legal battle ensued from 1988 to 1992 between the State of Florida, the U.S. government, and the sugar industry to resolve who was responsible for water quality standards, the maintenance of Everglades National Park and the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge.|$|E
500|$|As a {{trial lawyer}} Harlan was {{involved}} in a number of famous cases. One such case was the conflict over the estate left after the death in 1931 of Ella Wendel, who had no heirs and left almost all her wealth estimated at 30–100million to churches and charities. However a number of claimants, filed suits <b>in</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>federal</b> courts demanding a part of her fortune. Most of the claimants were imposters; Harlan acted as the main defender of her estate and will as well as the chief negotiator. Eventually a settlement among lawful claimants was reached in 1933. In the following years Harlan specialized in corporate law dealing with the cases like Randall v. Bailey, concerning the interpretation of state law governing distribution of corporate dividends. [...] In 1940, he represented the New York Board of Higher Education unsuccessfully in The Bertrand Russell Case in its efforts to retain Bertrand Russell on the faculty of the City College of New York; Russell was declared [...] "morally unfit" [...] to teach. The future justice also represented boxer Gene Tunney in a breach of contract suit brought by a would-be fight manager, a matter settled out of court.|$|E
