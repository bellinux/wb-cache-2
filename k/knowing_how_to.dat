25|$|There is {{a strong}} belief in the Kabbalah {{tradition}} that cosmic forces affect everything, and <b>knowing</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> understand them can prove to be valuable to the aspiring Kabbalist. Rav Berg, {{the founder of the}} Kabbalah Centre, wrote numerous books on astrology during his career.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a ternary <b>knowing</b> <b>how</b> {{operator}} <b>to</b> express that the agent knows <b>how</b> <b>to</b> achieve ϕ given ψ while maintaining χ in-between. It generalizes {{the logic of}} goal-directed <b>knowing</b> <b>how</b> proposed by Yanjing Wang 2015 'A logic of knowing how'. We give a sound and complete axiomatization of this logic.

25|$|The unicorn, {{through its}} intemperance and not <b>knowing</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> control itself, {{for the love}} it bears to fair maidens forgets its ferocity and wildness; and laying aside all fear it will go up to a seated damsel {{and go to sleep}} in her lap, and thus the hunters take it.|$|E
25|$|<b>Knowing</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> {{suppress}} {{and manage}} one's own feelings {{is known as}} emotional intelligence, {{the ability to control}} one's emotions {{and to be able to}} do this at a high level guarantees one's own ability to serve those in need. Emotional intelligence is performed while performing emotional labor, and without one the other can not be there.|$|E
6000|$|Tyrrel seized his opportunity. [...] "And if {{you were}} to {{withdraw}} your own design," [...] he asked, somewhat nervously, hardly <b>knowing</b> <b>how</b> best <b>to</b> frame his delicate question, [...] "do you think ... the directors ... would be likely to accept this one?" ...|$|R
60|$|The inquiry about Allan, {{though it}} would {{naturally}} have suggested itself to any one in Midwinter's position at that moment, added to Mr. Bashwood's confusion.

5000|$|A more neutral use of {{the term}} is in {{reference}} to novice players, who, not <b>knowing</b> yet <b>how</b> <b>to</b> roleplay, typically obsess about the statistical [...] "power" [...] of their characters rather than developing their characters' personalities.|$|R
25|$|Instruments used to {{accompany}} the dancers have changed to include those from Europe, but pre Hispanic ones, especially drums and flutes, are still used. However, as many dances are still tied to religious events, <b>knowing</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> play the traditional songs and dance the traditional dances still gives dancers and musicians social stature, as they are keepers of tradition and expected to pass it along to the next generation.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, Keys {{produced}} {{various studies}} related to human physical performance that were {{of interest to}} the military, such as studying the effects of testosterone on muscle work and vitamin supplementation as a performance enhancer on adequately fed soldiers, among many other similar studies. It was during the war that Keys and fellow researchers recognized the importance of <b>knowing</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> properly treat widespread starvation, since simple overfeeding for so many would be imprecise and there was a potential that the refeeding would fail.|$|E
25|$|Blair {{wrote a book}} of her memoirs, {{published}} in late May 2008, entitled Speaking for Myself: The Autobiography, and the book was listed as a Sunday Times best-seller. Interviewed about the book by Carole MacNeil on the Canadian network CBC Television on 1 June 2008, Blair stated that she felt most of the controversy about her in the British media was due to her pioneering role as the first wife of a British Prime Minister who had her own career, with the media simply not <b>knowing</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> treat her fairly and objectively.|$|E
60|$|Silently {{the others}} {{followed}} the directions of their leader, {{and once again}} they plunged into the brushwood. The way was harder than before and more than once they had to halt, not <b>knowing</b> exactly <b>how</b> <b>to</b> proceed.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not <b>knowing</b> exactly <b>how</b> <b>to</b> take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But concentrating all his crow's feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started {{me on the}} errand.|$|R

25|$|Thus, {{the design}} {{appears as a}} {{comfortable}} dwelling complete with loggia and conservatory. A lesser architect {{might not have been}} able to resist the addition of a small turret or pinnacle. Petre's ingenuity lay in <b>knowing</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> mix large windows and more comfortable features with the medieval, and then ascertaining the exact moment to halt the Gothic theme before it became a pastiche of the original. In this way Petre was referring in a modest way to the original Gothic revival period as conceived by such architects as James Wyatt, rather than the later Gothic, after it had fallen under the ecclesiastical Anglo-Catholic influences of such architects as Augustus Pugin in England, and Benjamin Mountfort in New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{investigation}} of eastern women’s lives, {{they found that}} though the GDR’s socialist policies encouraged women in the labor force, {{there had been no}} women creating these policies. Once again, the patriarch had created a public history in which women were cut out. The discovery of neglected cultural accounts, similar to Fiedler’s, has allowed women’s historians to create large databases, available to feminist historians, out of them. These sources are analyzed by the historians to compare them to scholarly works published during the same time period. Finding works that are within the same time period isn’t too difficult, but the challenge is in <b>knowing</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> combine what they learned from the source with what they know from the works.|$|E
25|$|After the United States entered World War II, Jackson was {{assigned}} to serve as crew chief aboard a B-25 Mitchell bomber.

The pilot of the aircraft not <b>knowing</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> {{put out the fire}} asked for Jackson's help which resulted in Jackson saving the plane and crew. Afterwards, Jackson decided to be a pilot. He successfully completed Aviation Cadet Training and became a commissioned officer. He became a gunnery instructor flying P-40 Warhawks and P-63 Kingcobras throughout the war, and ended the war under the controls of a B-24 Liberator bomber aircraft.|$|E
60|$|He hesitated, not <b>knowing</b> just <b>how</b> <b>to</b> {{commence}} {{the confession}} {{he was determined}} to make, though he was positive that it would place Peter of Blentz upon the throne, since the old prince had promised to support the Regent could it be proved that Barney was an impostor.|$|R
60|$|Vivian had, unbidden, seated {{himself by}} the side of Mr. Cleveland's library table; and, not <b>knowing</b> exactly <b>how</b> <b>to</b> proceed, was {{employing}} himself by making a calculation whether there were more black than white spots on the body of the old Newfoundland, who was now apparently happily slumbering.|$|R

25|$|According to {{the legend}} of chiles en nogada, there were three sisters {{from the city of}} Puebla who were in Mexico City. When the Army of the Three Guarantees entered the capital {{at the end of the}} Mexican War of Independence, they were feted by many. At one of these parties, the three sisters fell in love with three of the army’s officers. Soon after, Agustín de Iturbide himself was set to visit the city of Puebla. Remembering the sisters, the soon-to-be emperor wanted to visit them. Wanting to impress Iturbide but not <b>knowing</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> cook, the sisters turned to the nuns of the Santa Monica convent who were famous for their food. The nuns decided to invent a dish for the sisters, which would {{represent}} the three colors of the new Mexican flag. On the appointed day, the banquet was prepared with the dish now called chiles en nogada, which pleased Iturbide.|$|E
25|$|Not <b>knowing</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> play or compose music did {{not stop}} António from making music by himself. He would, using a tape recorder, {{mimicking}} sounds and rhythms while he sang, using his own voice or even tapping his hands on different objects. These recordings were then used by his supporting studio musicians {{as the basis for}} the song arrangements. Variações' music is characterized by the use of a variety of instruments, ranging from synthesizers, to Portuguese and classical guitars, to accordions and more. Defying genre definition, he created his own description for his sound: something between Braga and New York, reflecting the cosmopolitan, yet down to earth and rural aspect of his eclectic style. He was intent on becoming a popular artist in the true sense of the word and he managed to reach audiences which were very diverse, from the blue collar to the white collar workers, to the uneducated and the intellectuals, to young and old alike.|$|E
25|$|Feena is {{the princess}} of the Kingdom of Sphere {{on the moon and}} also the main female protagonist. In order to become more {{knowledgeable}} about Earth and be able to follow in her mother's footsteps, she comes to Earth in a homestay with the family of the primary secretary {{to the president of the}} United Nations, Sayaka Hozumi. Since she was very young, she has always wanted to know more about the Earth and some day she hopes to surpass her mother in trying to bridge the gap between the Earth and the Kingdom of Sphere. She is well educated in terms of literature and science and has great sword skills. However, she is somewhat naive in matters of the heart and has a tendency to jump into situations without thinking, (such as jumping into a river to save a drowning puppy, without <b>knowing</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> swim, and mistaking moths for aliens). Feena once came to Earth when she was a child, and met Tatsuya previously after her mother's death, in which Tatsuya tried to comfort her. She eventually falls in love with him and later marries him to finally bring peace between the Earth and the Moon.|$|E
6000|$|With a courage born of need I {{led the way}} {{straight}} toward the basement portal of a small brown hotel on Fourth Avenue, and was startled almost into flight to find myself in a bar-room.
