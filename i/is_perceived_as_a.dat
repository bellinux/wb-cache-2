5|$|Mascarene martins will mob the Mauritius kestrel, {{suggesting}} that it <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> potential predator. Martins on Mauritius may be infected by an endemic trypanosome, Trypanosoma phedinae, although the pathogenicity is unknown. Protozoan blood parasites of the genus Haemoproteus have also {{been found in the}} martin on Mauritius, although no blood parasites were found in a Madagascan specimen. A new species of louse fly, Ornithomya cecropis, was first found on a martin in Madagascar, and another bird from that island carried the feather mite Mesalges hirsutus, more commonly found in parrots.|$|E
5|$|Although modern fantasy {{may often}} embrace strangeness, the Ice and Fire series is {{generally}} praised for what <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sort of medieval realism. Believing that magic {{should be used}} moderately in the epic fantasy genre, Martin {{set out to make}} the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters. Though the amount of magic has gradually increased throughout the story, the series is still to end with less overt magic than most contemporary fantasies. In Martin's eyes, literary effective magic needs to represent strange and dangerous forces beyond human comprehension, not advanced alien technologies or formulaic spells. As such, the characters understand only the natural aspects of their world, but not the magical elements like the Others.|$|E
5|$|No predators or parasites are {{recorded}} for Brazza's martin, but Mascarene martins will mob the Mauritius kestrel, {{suggesting that it}} <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> potential predator. Mascarene martins may host a variety of parasites. On Mauritius they may be infected by an endemic trypanosome, Trypanosoma phedinae, although the pathogenicity is unknown.

5|$|The Andean condor is {{considered}} near {{threatened by the}} IUCN. It was first placed on the United States Endangered Species list in 1970, a status which is assigned to an animal that {{is in danger of}} extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. Threats to its population include loss of habitat needed for foraging, secondary poisoning from animals killed by hunters and persecution. It is threatened mainly in the northern area of its range, and is extremely rare in Venezuela and Colombia, where it has undergone considerable declines in recent years. Because it is adapted to very low mortality and has correspondingly low reproductive rates, it is extremely vulnerable to human persecution, most of which {{stems from the fact that}} it <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> threat by farmers due to alleged attacks on livestock. Education programs have been implemented by conservationists to dispel this misconception. Reintroduction programs using captive-bred Andean condors, which release birds hatched in North American zoos into the wild to bolster populations, have been introduced in Argentina, Venezuela, and Colombia. The first captive-bred Andean condors were released into the wild in 1989. When raising condors, human contact is minimal; chicks are fed with glove puppets which resemble adult Andean condors in order to prevent the chicks from imprinting on humans, which would endanger them upon release as they would not be wary of humans. The condors are kept in aviaries for three months prior to release, where they acclimatize to an environment similar to that which they will be released in. Released condors are tracked by satellite in order to observe their movements and to monitor whether they are still alive.|$|E

50|$|From the {{cognitive}} perspective, the brain <b>perceives</b> auditory stimuli <b>as</b> music according to gestalt principles, or “principles of grouping.” Gestalt principles include proximity, similarity, closure, and continuation. Each of the gestalt principles illustrates a different element of auditory stimuli that {{cause them to}} <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> group, or <b>as</b> one unit of music. Proximity dictates that auditory stimuli that are near to each other are seen <b>as</b> <b>a</b> group. Similarity dictates that when multiple auditory stimuli are present, the similar stimuli <b>are</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> group. Closure <b>is</b> the tendency to perceive an incomplete auditory pattern <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole—the brain “fills in” the gap. And continuation dictates that auditory stimuli {{are more likely to}} <b>be</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> group when they follow a continuous, detectable pattern.|$|R

25|$|Diacetyl in wine is {{produced}} by lactic acid bacteria, mainly Oenococcus oeni. In low levels it can impart positive nutty or caramel characters, however at levels above 5mg/L it creates an intense buttery or butterscotch flavour, where it <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> flaw. The sensory threshold for the compound can {{vary depending on the}} levels of certain wine components, such as sulfur dioxide. It can be produced as a metabolite of citric acid when all of the malic acid has been consumed. Diacetyl rarely taints wine to levels where it becomes undrinkable.|$|E
25|$|The {{technical}} {{principles for}} the surgical reconstruction of a nose {{derive from the}} essential operative principles of plastic surgery: that the applied procedure and technique(s) yield the most satisfactory functional and aesthetic outcome. Hence, the rhinoplastic reconstruction of a new nasal subunit, of virtually normal appearance, {{can be done in}} a few procedural stages, using intranasal tissues to correct defects of the mucosa; cartilage battens to brace against tissue contraction and depression (topographic collapse); axial skin flaps designed from three-dimensional (3-D) templates derived from the topographic subunits of the nose; and the refinement of the resultant correction with the subcutaneous sculpting of bone, cartilage, and flesh. Nonetheless, the physician-surgeon and the rhinoplasty patient must abide the fact that the reconstructed nasal subunit is not a nose proper, but a collagen-glued collage—of forehead skin, cheek skin, mucosa, vestibular lining, nasal septum, and fragments of ear cartilage—which <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> nose only because its contour, skin color, and skin texture are true to the original nose.|$|E

25|$|The mirror stage {{describes}} {{the formation of}} the Ego via the process of objectification, the Ego being the result of a conflict between one's perceived visual appearance and one's emotional experience. This identification is what Lacan called alienation. At six months, the baby still lacks physical co-ordination. The child is able to recognize themselves in a mirror prior to the attainment of control over their bodily movements. The child sees their image as a whole and the synthesis of this image produces a sense of contrast with the lack of co-ordination of the body, which <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fragmented body. The child experiences this contrast initially as a rivalry with their image, because the wholeness of the image threatens the child with fragmentation—thus the mirror stage gives rise to an aggressive tension between the subject and the image. To resolve this aggressive tension, the child identifies with the image: this primary identification with the counterpart forms the Ego. Lacan understands this moment of identification as a moment of jubilation, since it leads to an imaginary sense of mastery; yet when the child compares their own precarious sense of mastery with the omnipotence of the mother, a depressive reaction may accompany the jubilation.|$|E

500|$|The 3:39 song is in {{the folk}} music genre, and it <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sing-along sea chantey or {{drinking}} song. The lyrics to the song include lines such as [...] "Our heroes wear pinstripes/Pinstripes in blue/Give {{us a chance to}} feel like heroes, too." [...] The song makes references to Ernie Banks, Wrigley Field, and a specific reference to Banks' catch phrase of [...] "Let's play two!"

500|$|Musical tones {{produced}} by the human voice and all acoustical musical instruments incorporate noises in varying degrees. Most consonants in human speech (e.g., the sounds of f, v, s, z, both voiced and unvoiced th, Scottish and German ch) are characterised by distinctive noises, and even vowels are not entirely noise free. Wind instruments include the whizzing or hissing sounds of air breaking against {{the edges of the}} mouthpiece, while bowed instruments produce audible rubbing noises that contribute, when the instrument is poor or the player unskilful, to what <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> poor tone. When they are not excessive, listeners [...] "make themselves deaf" [...] to these noises by ignoring them.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, colour {{constancy}} in {{the visual}} system recalibrates {{the relations between the}} colours of an object and its surroundings, and because the surrounding sky is comparatively dark, the sunlit Moon <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> bright object. The edges of the full moon seem as bright as the centre, with no limb darkening, due to the reflective properties of lunar soil, which reflects more light back towards the Sun than in other directions. The Moon does appear larger when close to the horizon, but this is a purely psychological effect, known as the Moon illusion, first described in the 7th century BC. The full moon subtends an arc of about 0.52° (on average) in the sky, roughly the same apparent size as the Sun (see [...] ).|$|E

500|$|Bajan {{culture is}} syncretic, and the island's musical culture <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mixture of African and British musics, with certain unique {{elements}} that may derive from indigenous sources. Tension between African and British culture {{has long been}} a major element of Bajan history, and has included the banning of certain African-derived practices and black Barbadian parodies of British traditions. Simple entertainment is the basis for most Barbadians' participation in music and dance activities, though religious and other functional musics also occur. Barbadian folk culture declined in importance in the 20th century, but then rekindled in the 1970s, when many Barbadians became interested in their national culture and history. [...] This change was heralded by the arrival of spouge, a popular national genre that reflects Barbadian heritage and African origins; spouge helped kindle a resurgence in national pride, and became viewed as Barbados' answer to the popular Caribbean genres reggae and calypso from Jamaica and Trinidad, respectively.|$|E
500|$|One line of {{argument}} suggests that Parsifal was written {{in support of the}} ideas of Arthur de Gobineau who advocated Aryanism. Parsifal is proposed as the [...] "pure-blooded" [...] (i.e. Aryan) hero who overcomes Klingsor, who <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> Jewish stereotype, particularly since he opposes the quasi-Christian Knights of the Grail. Such claims remain heavily debated, since there is nothing explicit in the libretto to support them. Wagner never mentions such ideas in his many writings, and Cosima Wagner's diaries, which relate in great detail Wagner's thoughts over the last 14 years of his life (including the period covering the composition and first performance of Parsifal) never mention any such intention. Wagner first met Gobineau very briefly in 1876, but it was only in 1880 that he read Gobineau's An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races. However, Wagner had completed the libretto for Parsifal by 1877, and the original drafts of the story date back to 1857. Despite this chronological evidence, Gobineau is frequently cited as a major inspiration for Parsifal.|$|E
500|$|L. williamsii is {{native to}} {{northern}} Mexico and southern Texas. Individual stems are about [...] high with a diameter of , and {{may be found in}} clumps up to [...] wide. A large part of the stem is usually below ground. Mescaline is concentrated in the photosynthetic portion of the stem above ground. The center of the stem, which contains the growing point (the apical meristem), is sunken. Experienced collectors of peyote remove a thin slice {{from the top of the}} plant, leaving the growing point intact, thus allowing the plant to regenerate. Evidence indicates peyote was in use more than 5,500 years ago; dried peyote buttons presumed to be from a site on the Rio Grande, Texas, were radiocarbon dated to around 3780–3660 BC. Peyote <b>is</b> <b>perceived</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> means of accessing the spirit world. Attempts by the Roman Catholic church to suppress its use after the Spanish conquest were largely unsuccessful, and by the middle of the 20th century, peyote was more widely used than ever by indigenous peoples as far north as Canada.
