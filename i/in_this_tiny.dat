25|$|Altogether, {{the great}} grey shrike is common and {{widespread}} and not considered a threatened species by the IUCN (though they still include L. meridionalis in L. excubitor). Wherever it occurs, its numbers are usually many hundreds or even thousands per country. Its stronghold is the region around Sweden, where at least almost 20,000, {{perhaps as many as}} 50,000 were believed to live in the late 20th century. However, in some countries it is not robustly established; in Estonia only a few hundred are found, with less than 200 in Belgium and some more or less than 100 in Latvia and Lithuania, respectively. The few dozen in the Netherlands and the 10 birds or so in Denmark might disappear because of a few years of adverse circumstances. By contrast, in Luxembourg plentiful high-quality habitat is found; though the number of {{great grey shrike}}s <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>tiny</b> country is necessarily limited, the average population density there is 25 times as high as in Lithuania.|$|E
500|$|A {{study in}} the Baltic region showed that {{northern}} goldcrests {{were more likely to}} migrate, and increased their body mass beforehand; non-migratory southern birds did not increase their fat reserves. The travel speed of migrating goldcrests increased for those leaving later in the autumn, and was greater for the northernmost populations. Migration was faster on routes that crossed the Baltic Sea than on coastal routes, and the birds with the largest fat reserves travelled at the highest speeds. The ability to lay down fat is adversely affected <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>tiny</b> bird by poor health. In Hungary, goldcrests stopping temporarily on migration were mostly found in scrub, including blackthorn, hawthorn and pear, which provided some protection from sparrowhawks. Females migrated slightly earlier than males, but overall there were more males, with an average sex ratio of 1.6:1. Goldcrests can fly [...] in one day, although they keep at a lower level in heavy headwinds. This is a tame and inquisitive bird, and tired migrants will land near or on humans, sometimes searching for food on their clothing.|$|E

60|$|The sexton {{was there}} {{and told us that}} he was but ten years old when Miss Mitford died, but that he remembered her well and she was a very {{pleasant}} little woman. Others in the place who remembered her said the same--that she was very pleasant and sweet. We know that she was sweet and charming, but unfortunately the portraits we have of her do not give that impression. They represent her as a fat common-place looking person, a little vulgar perhaps. I fancy the artists were bunglers. I possess a copy of a very small pencil sketch made of her face by a dear old lady friend of mine, now dead, about the year 1851 or 2. My friend had a gift for portraiture in a peculiar way. When she saw a face that greatly interested her, in a drawing-room, on a platform, in the street, anywhere, it remained very vividly in her mind and on going home she would sketch it, and some of these sketches of well known persons are wonderfully good. She was staying in the country with a friend who drove with her to Swallowfield to call on Miss Mitford, and on her return to her friend's house she made the little sketch, and <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>tiny</b> portrait I can see the refinement, the sweetness, the animation and charm which she undoubtedly possessed.|$|E

60|$|The {{ladder of}} ascent in this tower {{is of course}} the lift, or, as it is called, the {{elevator}}. With all that we hear of American hustle and hurry it is rather strange that Americans seem to like {{more than we do}} to linger upon long words. And indeed {{there is an element of}} delay in their diction and spirit, very little understood, which I may discuss elsewhere. Anyhow they say elevator when we say lift, just as they say automobile when we say motor and stenographer when we say typist, or sometimes (by a slight confusion) typewriter. Which reminds me of another story that never existed, about a man who was accused of having murdered and dismembered his secretary when he had only taken his typing machine to pieces; but we must not dwell on these digressions. The Americans may have another reason for giving long and ceremonious titles to the lift. When first I came among them I had a suspicion that they possessed and practised a new and secret religion, which was the cult of the elevator. I fancied they worshipped the lift, or at any rate worshipped in the lift. The details or data of this suspicion it were now vain to collect, as I have regretfully abandoned it, except in so far as they illustrate the social principles underlying the structural plan of the building. Now an American gentleman invariably takes off his hat in the lift. He does not take off his hat in the hotel, even if it is crowded with ladies. But he always so salutes a lady in the elevator; and this marks the difference of atmosphere. The lift is a room, but the hotel is a street. But during my first delusion, of course, I assumed that he uncovered <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>tiny</b> temple merely because he was in church. There is something about the very word elevator that expresses a great deal of his vague but idealistic religion. Perhaps that flying chapel will eventually be ritualistically decorated like a chapel; possibly with a symbolic scheme of wings. Perhaps a brief religious service will be held in the elevator as it ascends; in a few well-chosen words touching the Utmost for the Highest. Possibly he would consent even to call the elevator a lift, if he could call it an uplift. There would be no difficulty, except what I cannot but regard as the chief moral problem of all optimistic modernism. I mean the difficulty of imagining a lift which is free to go up, if it is not also free to go down.|$|E

Yet, a recent manual of avian body masses, cites yet another species <b>in</b> <b>this</b> genus, the stripe-backed bittern, as having a mean body mass slightly lower than the least bittern, which is credited with a mean mass of 86.3 g. This bird's underparts and throat are white with light brown streaks. Its face and the sides of the neck are light brown; it has yellow eyes and a yellow bill. The adult male is glossy greenish black on the back and crown; the adult female is glossy brown on these parts. They show light brown parts on the wings in flight.|$|R

40|$|Building {{on two of}} Gumperz's {{foundational}} concerns-multilingual speech {{communities and}} linguistically linked intercultural miscommunication-I extend (or perhaps reduce) a couple of Gumperzian concepts to an almost limiting case: a single extended family in Chiapas, Mexico, where three deaf siblings interact with their hearing relatives of three generations. Here a spoken Mayan language (along with a little Spanish) is used {{side by side with}} a spontaneously emerging homesign or sign language. Linguistic tension emerges from misunderstandings and failures of communication <b>in</b> even <b>this</b> <b>tiny</b> speech community, and the complex pattern of interaction between its members suggests analogues of ethnolinguistic divisions, here even between siblings or parents and children, as well as nascent ideologies of language, mind, and identity familiar from much larger and more diversified speech situations. In particular I examine the crucial nexus of linguistically mediated social relations between the first deaf individual in the family and four categories of others: her parents, her deaf siblings, her hearing siblings, and her young (hearing) child.
