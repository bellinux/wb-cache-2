40|$|Background: Several major {{outbreaks}} {{in healthcare}} facilities have occurred {{with the emergence}} of multi-resistant bacteria. A possible route for dissemination is the hospital textiles and inadequate laundering of them. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop an easy-to-use method for simulating the laundering process of hospital textiles, and thereafter apply the method when evaluating the decontaminating efficacy of two different washing temperatures. Methods: The laundering process, including <b>tumble</b> <b>drying,</b> took place at two professional laundries. Enterococcus faecium was used as bioindicator. Results: The results showed that a lowering of the washing temperature from 70 °C to 60 °C did not affect the decontamination efficacy; the washing cycle alone reduced the number of bacteria with 3 – 5 log 10 CFU, whereas the following <b>tumble</b> <b>drying</b> reduced the bacterial numbers with another 3 – 4 log 10 CFU, yielding the same final result independent of washing temperature. Without <b>tumble</b> <b>drying,</b> there was an obvious risk of adding non-fermenting gram-negative bacteria to the fabric. These bacteria originated from the washing cycle. Conclusion: A simple method to simulate hospital laundering was developed. To save energy, it is possible to use a washing temperature of 60 °C, but the washing cycle should be followed by <b>tumble</b> <b>drying,</b> and the whole laundering process needs to be monitored to maintain sufficient textile hygiene...|$|R

Most such stains can be removed with lukewarm water and detergent, but bleach can also be used. Olefin fiber has a low melting point (around 225 to 335 °F, depending on the polymer's grade) so items should be ironed at a very low temperature, if at all. Items such as outdoor carpets and other fabrics can be hosed off. Olefin is easy to recycle.|$|R

40|$|By {{applying}} micro-agitation to plain knit fabrics, {{the fabric}} can be effectively relaxed. Water evaporates when pressure drops.

A chamber was built to provide a suitable environment and a new LPR (Low Pressure Relaxation) process was developed. Experiments were performed with two sets of fabrics, one from cotton and the other from wool. Results were compared between the new LPR process and wash and <b>tumble</b> <b>drying</b> process.

The results showed that after the removal of sizing materials in the desizing process, fibrillation started to occur and the fibrillation effect was further enhanced with the formation of long fibrils during primary fibrillation. Long fibrils, with an average length over 100 microns, needed to be removed by enzyme treatment in order to prevent fibre entanglement leading to pill formation and an adverse surface appearance.

It is, however, costly and time consuming to design several prototypes for airflow measurements. In this paper, several fluid mechanic parameters in a partial model of the internal duct system of a tumble dryer have been studied in the CFD software Comsol MultiPhysics. The purpose was to establish a numerically based design process, where the design is conducted based on visual analysis of air velocity and vorticity, and two design criteria. The geometry design was conducted by a CAD-engineer, which was the counterpart of this project. In order to enable a successful design process, it was essential to establish a strong relation between fluid parameters and design criteria in order to share knowledge effectively with the CAD-engineer. Two geometry modifications, based on a standard model, were conducted on the duct. Based on the design criteria, the pressure drop and the non-uniformity coefficient of the outlet airflow, the second modification (Modification 2) represents an improvement as the pressure drop is reduced by 23 % and the uniformity at the outflow section is increased by 3 %.

Changes in general physical properties, dimensional change, and surface appearance of four fabrics were studied after ten launderings at three wash water temperatures with two drying methods.

40|$|Felting of wool is {{unwanted}} in {{raw wool}} scouring, wet treatments of most yarns {{and in the}} finished garment. It is desirable in some other uses and essential in the felt industries. The accepted method of testing loose wool felting is the Aachen felting test but it is laborious and relatively expensive. There is no generally accepted method for testing yarn shrinkage. For these trials new techniques using a <b>household</b> <b>tumble</b> dryer were developed for testing loose wool felting and yarn shrinkage. Analysis indicated that successful techniques had been developed for measuring loose wool felting and yarn shrinkage. Results with the loose wool felting technique {{were found to be}} highly correlated with those of the Aachen felting method (r = 0. 93). The effects of fibre characteristics on both loose wool felting and yarn shrinkage were investigated for straight-bred Romneys and for loose wool felting in ¼Merino ¾Romney (QM) crosses. Loose wool felting was most highly correlated with bulk (r = - 0. 65 for Romneys and - 0. 73. for QM's), crimp frequency (r = - 0. 53 and - 0. 41 respectively) and lustre (- 0. 30 and - 0. 40 respectively). Loose wool bulk (r = - 0. 25) and greasy fleece weight (r = - 0. 40) were the most highly correlated to yarn shrinkage. The greasy fleece weight relationship is thought to be environmental in origin. Micron and staple length were found to play only minor roles in loose wool felting and yarn shrinkage. Cotting was found not to be significantly correlated to either loose wool felting or yarn shrinkage. Loose wool feltability was highly correlated (r = 0. 65) to yarn shrinkage. A large percentage of yarn shrinkage variation was left unexplained.

All systems were able to maintain the viability of all organisms for 24 h, {{but none of them}} could support all tested species after 48 h.  The most difficult species to recover was Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and in polymicrobial samples overgrowth was an observed problem. The aim of the second study was to study the presence of TSST- 1 and three other important toxin genes in invasive isolates of Staphylococcus aureus collected during the years 2000 - 2012 at two tertiary hospitals. The genes encoding the staphylococcal toxins were detected by PCR, and whole-genome sequencing was used for analyzing the genetic relatedness between isolates. The results showed that the most common toxin was TSST- 1, and isolates positive for this toxin exhibited a clear clonality independent of year and hospital. The typical patient was a male aged 55 - 74 years and with a bone or a joint infection. The third study was a clinical study of the effect of silver-based wound dressings on the bacterial flora in chronic leg ulcers. Phenotypic and genetic silver-resistance were investigated before and after topical silver treatment, by determining the silver nitrate MICs and by detecting sil genes with PCR. The silver-based dressings had a limited effect on primary wound pathogens, and the activity of silver nitrate on S. aureus was mainly bacteriostatic. A silver-resistant Enterobacter cloacae strain was identified after only three weeks of treatment, and cephalosporin-resistant members of the Enterobacteriaceae family were relatively prone to developed silver-resistance after silver exposure in vitro. The last study was undertaken in order to develop an easy-to-use method for simulating the laundering process of hospital textiles, and apply the method when evaluating the decontaminating efficacy of two different washing temperatures. The laundering process took place at professional laundries, and Enterococcus faecium was used as a bioindicator.
