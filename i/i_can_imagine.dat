25|$|Tuten spent 15 years {{heading the}} {{graduate}} program in creative {{writing at the}} City College of New York, which he co-founded. In that capacity, he championed the work of students Walter Mosley, Oscar Hijuelos, Philip Graham, Aurelie Sheehan, Salar Abdoh, Ernesto Quiñonez, and many others. He also teaches classes on experimental writing at The New School. He {{is on the board}} of advisors for Guernica Magazine and executive editor of Smyles & Fish. Tuten's short fiction has appeared in Granta, Conjunctions, Fence, Fiction, The New Review of Literature, Tri-Quarterly, and Harper's Magazine. In 1973, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Creative Writing and in 2001 was given the Award for Distinguished Writing from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In describing his usage of the past in his novels (where many of them are set), Tuten once stated:The fact that I don’t write about contemporary life doesn’t mean I’m any less taken up with it. I find it too limiting to write about contemporary life just in contemporary diction, however. I don’t think there's enough flexibility. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> writing about characters who feel passion for one another in a contemporary setting but I don’t, as yet, hear the language for that. But I’m always thinking about contemporary life vis a vis the way it looks in the past. I mean how it looks in the past is a reflection of what it is today. That's what interests me. I think I’m always talking about present-day life, not only political life but about the quality of passion, the quality of all relationships and love.|$|E

Scott would later reveal in a 2017 interview that Jaws had made a lasting impression, [...] "I was always put off from swimming ever since I watched Jaws," [...] says Scott. [...] "I quite liked swimming, actually, and I'd occasionally dive, but once I saw Jaws there was no way I was ever going to learn to surf – no way! Because <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> my legs, my little pinkies hanging underneath the surfboard and I know I'm going to be the one." ...|$|E

500|$|Starting {{with this}} episode, Arthur Darvill {{achieved}} regular status. British actor Michael Gambon {{was cast in}} the role of Kazran. Andy Pryor, the casting director, did not believe Gambon would be available, and was surprised when Gambon accepted the role. Smith, Gillan, and Darvill were very honoured to work with him. Moffat stated, [...] "Michael Gambon is as distinguished an actor as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> {{and the fact that he}} was Dumbledore means that he is already known to millions of children". Kazran was played as a boy by Laurence Belcher and as a young adult by Danny Horn. Director Toby Haynes said that acting came naturally to Belcher and he [...] "captured the story" [...] and drew the audience in.|$|E
500|$|Downey, Stiller, Black and Cruise were {{repeatedly}} {{singled out}} for praise by numerous critics, claiming that they [...] "stole the show", was [...] "...off-the-charts hilarious ...", and would bring viewers [...] "...the fondest memories of [...] work." [...] Scott Feinberg, of the Los Angeles Times, criticized the concept of Downey's portrayal of an African-American, writing [...] "...I just can't imagine any circumstance under which a blackface performance would be acceptable, any more than <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> any circumstance under which {{the use of the}} N-word would be acceptable." [...] Sara Vilkomerson said Cruise did [...] "...an astonishingly funny and surprising supporting performance." [...] Logan Hill of New York argued against Cruise's cameo saying that it [...] "...just makes him look a little lost and almost pathetic—shucking and jiving, trying to appeal to the younger moviegoers who are abandoning him." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} promoted polemics regarding September Morn and censorship, {{and multiple}} editorial cartoons; one depicted {{a young woman}} bathing, only her head showing, with a caption attributed to Comstock reading [...] "Don't you suppose <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> what is UNDER the water?". Comstock called the work [...] "demoralizing in the extreme and especially calculated to excite immodesty in the young", arguing {{that it must be}} suppressed {{in the interest of the}} children. He emphasized that [...] "the law is the law... the picture will have to come out of the window". Reverend Sydney Ussher of St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church took a more moderate approach, explaining that [...] "so vivid a display of nudity as September Morn" [...] would best not be displayed in the United States, owing to the people's relative lack of appreciation for art.|$|E

2500|$|In 1999, Mutke {{enlisted the}} help of Professor Otto Wagner of the Munich Technical University to run {{computational}} tests to determine whether the aircraft could break the sound barrier. These tests do not rule out the possibility, but are lacking accurate data on the coefficient of drag that would be needed to make accurate simulations. Wagner stated [...] "I don't want to exclude the possibility, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> he may also have been just below the speed of sound and felt the buffeting, but did not go above Mach-1." ...|$|E

(Vladimir Putin, former KGB officer, chose not to change the date to another): [...] "The successors of the KGB still haven't renounced anything; they even celebrate their professional holiday the same day, as during repression, on the 20th of December. It is [...] as if the present intelligence and counterespionage services of Germany celebrated Gestapo Day. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> how indignant our press would be!" ...|$|E

2500|$|It was {{confirmed}} in April 2012 that Bianca, Carol and Bianca's children would depart Albert Square later that month for six months. Explaining her temporary departure, Palmer said, [...] "I'm only taking time off now {{because this is}} when the kids' holidays are. When I re-signed my contract I said, 'I love EastEnders, but I love my kids more'. Listen, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> staying in the show till I'm in my 60s, but it's a full-on job. If they hadn't been prepared to give me time off, I'd have had to choose the kids." [...] Bianca left the show on 27 April 2012 when she {{was sent back to}} prison for attempting to steal from the market before returning 27 November of that year.|$|E
2500|$|Ewa Podleś {{likewise}} {{stated that}} [...] "It's {{enough to hear}} her, I'm positive! Because she could say everything only with her voice! <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> everything, I can see everything {{in front of my}} eye." [...] Opera director Sandro Sequi, who witnessed many Callas performances close-up, states, [...] "For me, she was extremely stylized and classic, yet at the same time, human—but humanity on a higher plane of existence, almost sublime. Realism was foreign to her, and that is why she was the greatest of opera singers. After all, opera is the least realistic of theater forms... She was wasted in verismo roles, even Tosca, no matter how brilliantly she could act such roles." [...] Scott adds, [...] "Early nineteenth-century opera... is not merely the antithesis of reality, it also requires highly stylized acting. Callas had the perfect face for it. Her big features matched its grandiloquence and spoke volumes from a distance." ...|$|E
2500|$|The diaries {{have become}} famous {{mostly because of}} the {{frequent}} remarks on and criticisms of Churchill. Although the diaries contain passages expressing admiration of Churchill, they {{also served as a}} vent for Brooke's frustration with working with the Prime Minister. The diaries also give sharp opinions on several of the top Allied leaders. The American generals Eisenhower and Marshall, for example, are described as poor strategists and Field Marshal Sir Harold Alexander as unintelligent. Among the few individuals of whom Brooke seems to have kept consistently positive opinions, from a military standpoint, were General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, Field Marshal Sir John Dill, and Joseph Stalin. Brooke admired Stalin for his quick brain and grasp of military strategy. Otherwise he had no illusions about the man, describing Stalin thus: [...] "He has got an unpleasantly cold, crafty, dead face, and whenever I look at him <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> his sending off people to their doom without ever turning a hair." ...|$|E

2500|$|To the {{backdrop}} of the June 1975 Italian elections, Fo wrote Il Fanfani rapito (Fanfani Kidnapped)—a reference to Amintore Fanfani. Also in June 1975, Fo, Rame {{and other members of the}} company went to China—Fo later used his recollections of the trip in the monologue La storia della tigre (The Tale of a Tiger), with which he toured around Italy in 1978. The same year (1975) Fo was nominated for the Nobel Prize for the first time. He thought the idea absurd: [...] "I have become famous for my aversion to figures of reverence and genuflections of any kind. This Nobel business is a real comedy. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> the look on the faces of certain state officials, magistrates and politicians I know. They take great pains to shut me up and clap me in handcuffs, and the Swedes go and play a trick like this ... would be like acting in one of my plays." ...|$|E
2500|$|Apart {{from the}} charge of obscurantism, other {{analytic}} philosophers considered the actual content of Heidegger's work to be either faulty and meaningless, vapid or uninteresting. However, not all analytic philosophers have been as hostile. Gilbert Ryle wrote a critical yet positive review of Being and Time. Ludwig Wittgenstein made a remark recorded by Friedrich Waismann: [...] "To be sure, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> what Heidegger means by being and anxiety" [...] which has been construed by some commentators as sympathetic to Heidegger's philosophical approach. These positive and negative analytic evaluations have been collected in Michael Murray (ed.), Heidegger and Modern Philosophy: Critical Essays (Yale University Press, 1978). Heidegger's reputation within English-language philosophy has slightly improved in philosophical terms in some part {{through the efforts of}} Hubert Dreyfus, Richard Rorty, and a recent generation of analytically oriented phenomenology scholars. Pragmatist Rorty claimed that Heidegger's approach to philosophy {{in the first half of}} his career has much in common with that of the latter-day Ludwig Wittgenstein. Nevertheless, Rorty asserted that what Heidegger had constructed in his writings was a myth of being rather than an account of it.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1912 Asquith {{travelled}} to Dublin (the first sitting Prime Minister {{to do so}} in over a century) to make a speech, ridiculing Unionist {{demands for}} a referendum on the issue via an election and calling their campaign [...] "purely destructive in its objects, anarchic and chaotic in its methods". In response the Unionists had a meeting on 27 July at Blenheim Palace, the birthplace of Winston Churchill, one of Asquith's ministers. More than 13,000 people attended, including over 40 peers. In Law's speech he said [...] "I said so to [...] and I say so now, with the full sense of the responsibility which attaches to my position, that if the attempt be made under present conditions, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>imagine</b> no length of resistance to which Ulster will go, in which I shall not be ready to support them, and in which they will not be supported by {{the overwhelming majority of the}} British people". This speech was more known and criticised than any others; it implied both he and the British people would support the Ulstermen in anything, including armed rebellion.|$|E
