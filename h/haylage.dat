40|$|Abstract: Perennial legumes, alfalfa, red clover, bird's foot trefoil, white clover, {{sainfoin}} and grasses, cock's foot, meadow fescue, tall fescue, Italian ryegrass, English ryegrass, French ryegrass, {{red fescue}} and Timothy grass {{can be grown}} successfully in pure crops and in legume-grass mixtures, on different soil types. Their importance in livestock development is based primarily on the great potential for yield of dry matter of over 20 t ha- 1 if adequate agro-technical measures have been applied. Also, perennial legumes are characterized with high content of nutritive substances, especially protein and represent the most important protein source in livestock nutrition. Depending on the species and pheno stage of utilization, the content of crude proteins in grasses varies from 100 to 174, 6 g kg- 1 of DM, and in perennial legumes from 190, 0 to 228, 8 g kg- 1 of DM. Livestock feed obtained from these plant species {{can be used in}} several ways, from grazing as most efficient and economical way, to preparation of hay and high quality silages and <b>haylages.</b> Stated forage species are very important in sustainable agriculture and organic production, considering that they carry out the process of biological fixation of nitrogen, but also from the ecological aspect.

It is most commonly associated with ingestion of foods that swell after eating or feeds that are coarse (bedding or poor quality roughage), poor dental care, poor mastication, inadequate drinking, ingestion of a foreign object, and alterations in the normal function of the stomach. Persimmons, which form a sticky gel in the stomach, and <b>haylage,</b> have both been associated with it, as has wheat, barley, mesquite beans, and beet pulp. Horses usually show signs of mild colic that is chronic, unresponsive to analgesics, and may include signs such as dysphagia, ptyalism, bruxism, fever, and lethargy, although severe colic signs may occur. Signs of shock may be seen if gastric rupture has occurred. Usually, the impaction must be quite large before it presents symptoms, and may be diagnosed via gastroscopy or ultrasound, although rectal examinations are unhelpful. Persimmon impaction is treated with infusions of Coca-Cola. Other gastric impactions are often resolves with enteral fluids. Quick treatment generally produces a favorable prognosis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Important role of alfalfa in {{development}} of animal husbandry, {{is based on}} high potential for production of biomass. Reaching of high green (over 80 t ha- 1) and dry matter yield (approx. 20 t ha- 1) with low investment during all period of utilization makes alfalfa production very economical. Divergent selection materials were used to create high productive domestic alfalfa cultivars with excellent field persistence, which is important factor for high and stable yield during entire exploitation period. On the other hand, alfalfa is {{a rich source of}} crude protein with excellent digestibility. Proteins from alfalfa herbage are the cheapest source of protein in animal feed. Content of crude protein strongly depend on development stage of plant material and can be 200 to 240 g kg- 1 DM, while crude protein yield can be over 3. 5 t ha- 1. Besides that, alfalfa herbage had a high content of macro and micro element, which are so important for animal health. It is usually grown in pure stand, although it’s a good component of grass-legumes mixtures. Alfalfa biomass can be used in several ways, usually as hay, but also as high quality silages, <b>haylages,</b> dehydrated in form of briquettes or by grazing. Symbiotic N 2 fixation gives alfalfa not just economical, but very high ecological importance, too. It’s a reason why alfalfa, besides important role in conventional husbandry is getting great role in sustainable agriculture and organic production.

50|$|A forage {{harvester}} (also {{known as a}} silage harvester, forager or chopper) is a farm implement that harvests forage plants to make silage. Silage is grass, corn or other plant that has been chopped into small pieces, and compacted together in a storage silo, silage bunker, or in silage bags. The silage is then fermented to provide feed for livestock. <b>Haylage</b> is a similar process to silage but using grass which has dried.|$|E
50|$|A recent {{innovation}} in hay storage {{has been the}} development of the silage or <b>haylage</b> bale, which is a high-moisture bale wrapped in plastic film. These are baled much wetter than hay bales, and are usually smaller than hay bales because the greater moisture content makes them heavier and harder to handle. These bales begin to ferment almost immediately, and the metal bale spear stabbed into the core becomes very warm to the touch from the fermentation process.|$|E

Specifically, the given assessment compared John Deere 960 Baler and Kuhn VB 2160 Baler while considering the following parameters: quality of cutting, bale density, <b>haylage,</b> capacity and performance, economic analysis and recommendation for their use in agriculture. John Deere 960 Baler achieved better results in the majority of performed tests. The values of bale density were the following: 666. 25 kg. m- 3 (<b>haylage),</b> 221. 39 kg. m- 3 (hay), 176. 62 kg. m- 3 (straw). The assessment of <b>haylage</b> quality was excellent.

Baling costs per 1 kilogram of forage revealed the following figures: 0. 036 CZK (<b>haylage),</b> 0. 079 CZK (hay) and 0. 101 CZK (straw). Costs assessment for practical use of both balers per operating year indicates that the JD 960 Baler´s use is more cost effective by 1, 320 CZK per 100 hectares (<b>haylage),</b> by 2, 690 CZK (hay) and by 6, 000 CZK (straw) in comparison with Kuhn VB 2160 Baler.

The successive energetic parameters glycaemia, cholesterol, triacylglycerols, urae and totally albumens were evaluated in the practised metabolic profile tests. Complementary parameters were enzyme gamma-glutamyl, ketone bodies substances and acid-basic secretion of urine. The work evidenced that the nutritive ration based on the grass <b>haylage</b> did not fill up the determinated requirements from the point of the dry substance and nett energy of lactation. The mentioned lack reflected the reduced content triacylglycerols especially in the rising phase of lactation. The energetic deficit in that period was not such that a reduction of the condition of the milch cows would occure frequently and the creation of ketone bodies substances. The nutritive ration based on the grass <b>haylage</b> is possible to use like an alternative nourishment of high productive milch cows in marginal situations and only for limited time...|$|E
40|$|RONO: 00 Cool season {{pastures}} {{can contain}} {{substantial amounts of}} non-structural carbohydrates (NSC). (NSC = water soluble carbohydrates (WSC) + starch). Over consumption of NSC by grazing equids {{has been linked to}} the development of laminitis. To reduce the risk, equines prone to laminitis commonly have restricted periods at pasture, being in stables or dry lots {{for the remainder of the}} day, with access to varying amounts of conserved forage e. g. hay or <b>haylage</b> that is low in NSC. However, intakes of pasture during periods of restricted grazing time have been little studied. The aim of this study was to determine the relative dry matter intakes of pasture and <b>haylage</b> by ponies allowed three hours grazing time per day and ad libitum access to <b>haylage</b> for the remainder of the day, monitored over six weeks.
