500|$|In the United Kingdom, the {{documentary}} premiered on Channel 4 on December 14, 2005. I'm Going to Tell You a Secret was not released commercially {{and was only}} viewed on MTV and Channel 4. Åkerlund told BlackBook that he wished more people {{had the chance to}} see {{the documentary}} because according to him, it is [...] "a really strong piece of art, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me.....</b> it had a lot of my blood, sweat and tears in it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "There isn't {{a team in}} the National League that's {{better than}} us. The pressure's back on them <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me.</b> They were on paper {{the best team in}} the {{division}} last year and they were supposed to win, and they didn’t. One, there are four other teams in our division who are going to make sure that doesn't happen, and two, has anyone ever heard of plagiarism? [...] That was pretty good, especially coming from him. He's a quiet guy, so it was probably shocking when he said it. Not shocking in a bad way, like 'Wow, I can't believe he said that.' More like, 'Wow, he finally said something because he's a leader on that team and you definitely need to be a vocal leader." ...|$|E
500|$|Attention also {{focused on}} Jaguar's {{improved}} pace during the event. Prior to the race, {{the team had}} been criticised by the media {{for their ability to}} perform well in the series with some publications criticising their move of signing Evans and Carroll to drive their cars. Evans said his improved performance encouraged everyone working for the team and it gave Jaguar more confidence: [...] "If you look at the bigger picture, I’ve got to be satisfied with today. Qualifying was great, to be honest, I topped the group. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> or the whole team if this would have happened after Marrakesh, we would have taken it with both hands." [...] Carroll hoped he would have a strong performance in the event and be faster than he could be but it was an issue that could be improved on. Jaguar team principal James Barclay stated the improvement was [...] "a little bit of a positive surprise" [...] but was unsure if Carroll's problem {{at the start of the}} race was caused by driver error or an electrical issue but admitted his team had to improve their understanding of full course yellow in future races.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me--that it isn't all true," [...] she begged. [...] "Tell me {{that your}} {{kindness}} to me, at least, was real--that {{you did not}} mean it to be for my unhappiness afterwards. Please tell me that. I think <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> cared to <b>ask</b> <b>me,</b> that I could forgive everything else." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll give it up," [...] said Ray. [...] "I {{might have}} a try at {{squaring}} the circle <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me,</b> but {{the solution of the}} Aunt Josephina problem is beyond me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It’ll be all right, Isaac," [...] he ses. [...] "I wouldn’t ’ave a drink <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to. Don’t seem to {{care for}} it now. I was saying so to you on’y last night, wasn’t I, Peter?" ...|$|R
500|$|Garrett {{initially}} wrote [...] "Soldier" [...] {{in a taxi}} while {{going to}} the studio where the band worked on Destiny Fulfilled; he sang the hook to the members afterwards and they liked it. Garrett further revealed about his collaboration with the group, [...] "I loved how Destiny's Child evolved and became this really incredible pop group but I wanted to introduce them to the hood {{from the perspective of}} having the world look at them in a different way... What was great about that was they all liked guys from the streets. Each verse was a representation of the guy they were actually into." [...] During an interview with MTV News, Rowland said that with [...] "Soldier" [...] each member wanted to talk about their preference for a man during their solo verses, the place where he lives and his physical appearance. Beyoncé stated that as the song had a [...] "Southern feel" [...] and beat, they wanted to collaborate with Lil Wayne and T.I. who according to her added [...] "rawness, realness and edge to the song". During an interview in 2014, Lil Wayne discussed his contribution in the song, [...] "That set me off. Them little eight bars right there, that got me there boy. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> why, it was Beyoncé. That shit was big." [...] "Soldier" [...] was included on the group's compilation albums #1's (2005) and [...] (2012).|$|E
500|$|Upon the video's release, several {{media outlets}} noticed a {{resemblance}} between the colorful aesthetics of [...] "Rude Boy" [...] {{and those of}} British singer-songwriter and rapper M.I.A.'s video [...] "Boyz". Melina Matsoukas responded to the allegations that she had copied the idea, and said, [...] "Afterward I was like, 'Oh, this sucks. They tore down my video... video's great too. It definitely wasn't trying to rip anybody off at all, it was just our approach and the animation stuff, it had a similar vibe." [...] Matsoukas explained that {{the inspiration for the}} video did not come from one particular source, but from a variety of pop culture icons. She concluded, [...] "We're all inspired by similar elements and it came together in that way." [...] Several critics noticed the differences between Rihanna's previous singles, [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] and [...] "Hard", and that [...] "Rude Boy" [...] had adopted a care-free and brighter image. Becky Bain of Idolator also noticed the similarities between M.I.A.'s video [...] "Boyz" [...] and [...] "Rude Boy", and wrote, [...] "We're digging the reggae-inflected jam, although the Bob Marley-meets-M.I.A. color explosion becomes a little hard on the eyes after awhile." [...] Bain said the video [...] "is colorful, loud, vibrant, and a complete departure from the mostly depressing captivity scenarios and over-the-top war imagery of the previous videos from her Rated R singles." [...] Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly also commented on the vibrancy of the video and its resemblance to M.I.A.'s video, [...] "It's a wild explosion of clashing colors, bold block lettering, and shaky camerawork. As many observers instantly pointed out, it all owes more than a little to the aesthetic of M.I.A.which, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me,</b> is not a bad thing at all." [...] Jocelyn Vena of MTV commented on the change of visual direction in the video, calling it [...] "a colorful departure from the dark fare previously released from her Rated R album." [...] Vena also wrote about the stylization of the video's content with regard to Rihanna's heritage. She wrote that the video is infused with [...] "a kaleidoscope of prints and colors, embracing her roots in Caribbean dance-hall-inspired costumes." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Newman {{died there}} {{appeared}} in a monthly magazine a series of very unflattering sketches by one who had lived under his roof. I ventured to ask Cardinal Manning if he had seen these sketches. He replied that he had and thought them very shocking; the writer must have a very unenviable mind, , and then, having thus sacrificed to propriety, after a moment's pause he added: [...] "But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> if they are like poor Newman, I am bound to say – a photograph." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I will; I {{would do}} {{a great deal more}} than that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to, Jess," [...] he {{answered}} tenderly, for now that she was going away he felt curiously drawn towards her, and was anxious to show it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Afraid of you! No: I {{am afraid}} of myself; {{afraid of the}} future; afraid FOR you. But my mind is already made up on this subject. When I brought about this meeting {{between you and your}} mother I {{determined}} to marry <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> again." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{looked up}} with a reproachful smile, and shook her head. 'That summer,' she went on, 'you <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> ten times <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> once. I am older now; {{much more of a}} woman, you know; and my opinion is changed about some people; {{especially}} about one.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Tron Øgrim was {{extremely}} {{important for the}} Norwegian wiki movement, and he was often interviewed by the press about Wikipedia. He gave a lecture about Wikipedia when Wikipedia's co-founder Jimmy Wales visited Norway in May 2006. When journalists challenged him about the sometimes erroneous information that the encyclopedia presents, Øgrim responded that by itself {{that was not a}} problem– on the contrary it may be viewed as an advantage: [...] "Wikipedia asks everybody to do a checkup of their own information and not accept anything on face value. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me,</b> it is a democratic problem that so little awareness of source criticism exists today in the Norwegian school system." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2017 Dita Von Teese stated on her Instagram that Stefania's [...] "genuine {{warmth and}} sensuality always shine through in photos, {{which is why}} she's my {{favorite}} Dita Von Teese lingerie model, and {{one of these days}} I'd like {{to find a way to}} have her as a burlesque protegé. One can study and mimic dance moves and wear fancy costumes, but the hardest thing to convey and the real trick is to do what Stefania does naturally. When we brought Strip Strip Hooray to Australia, she came backstage and everyone was tripping over themselves to know who she was... she's just got IT. She's like a cross between Marilyn Monroe and baby Brigitte Nielson, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me,</b> she's a national treasure in Australia." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since 1990, Ikeda has {{partnered with}} Rabbi Abraham Cooper and the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization, to combat anti-Semitism in Japan. In a 2001 interview, Rabbi Cooper stated he was [...] "getting nowhere after {{reaching}} out to the Japanese media about anti-Semitism in Japan. The only partners we found to help us bring our concerns to the Japanese public were people from Soka University under the leadership of Daisaku Ikeda. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> who our best friend in Japan is, who 'gets it,' it is Ikeda. He was actually our first visitor to the Museum of Tolerance." [...] Their friendship led to the joint development of a Japanese-language Holocaust exhibition The Courage to Remember, which was seen by more than two million people in Japan between 1994 and 2007. In 2015, {{a new version of the}} exhibit opened in Tokyo focusing on the bravery of Anne Frank and Chiune Sugihara.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{always give}} {{too much to}} ladies. It's a {{weakness}} of mine, and that's the way I ruin myself," [...] said old Joe. [...] "That's your account. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> for another penny, and made it an open question, I'd repent of being so liberal, and knock off half-a-crown." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{little girl}} shall {{never come to}} that, if I can help it," [...] said Mr. Shaw, holding her close, with a look that made Maud add, as she laid her cheek against his own, [...] "But I 'd do it, father, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to, for I truly want to help." ...|$|R
50|$|I'll admit that, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> years ago, I {{still had}} {{thoughts}} that EA was the Evil Empire, {{the company that}} crushes the small studios...I'd have been surprised, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> told me {{a year ago that}} we'd end up with EA as a publisher. When we went out and talked to people, especially EA Partners people like Valve, we got almost uniformly positive responses from them.|$|R
2500|$|... “The old days. [...] After all {{the fall}} of 1906 is a far piece back, and high school {{football}} then was a mighty casual and simple thing. [...] That was my senior year and I was a ‘new boy’, having just moved to Massillon that summer from the wide open spaces of South Dakota, Wyoming and Nebraska. [...] The first day at school several of my classmates came around to suggest that of course I was coming out for football; and although I protested that I {{had never had a}} ball in my hands, they countered with the argument that I was a good sized lump of a boy and would make a fine prospect. [...] So I promised. [...] Well the only preparation necessary was to take an old pair of shoes down to the town cobbler and have some cleats nailed on them. [...] I think the athletic association must have had some football pants, but I do remember distinctly that you had to furnish your own stockings (any color) and an old sweater. [...] Put these on and you were in business. [...] I can’t believe that there were more than 11 candidates out because I made the team the first afternoon. [...] Nor did we have a regular coach. [...] A boy named Fritz Merwin, who I think had played the year before was our coach. [...] <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me,</b> he’s the one whose picture ought to be hanging up around there someplace. [...] He didn’t get paid anything, and if a coach ever had an awkward squad of 11 nit-wits, he did. [...] But he was out there every afternoon, early and late teaching us fundamentals instead of fancy razzle-dazzle plays, and in the end it paid off because we won a few games. [...] I can’t remember who we beat, but I do recall, painfully even after this lapse of time, that our friends over at the county seat (Canton, Ohio) took us to the cleaners twice.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Fenwick, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me,</b> I'd {{rather not}} talk about her;--I would indeed. She's been and brought a slur upon us all, the vile thing! <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>ask</b> <b>me,</b> Mr. Fenwick, there ain't nothing too bad for her." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I think I {{could tell}} <b>you</b> almost {{anything}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> that way, my boy. It isn't that I am too proud,--and you're right about my sometimes wanting to free my mind,--but it's because {{a man of}} forty don't just like to open out to young fellows, {{if there is any}} danger of their laughing at him, though he may deserve it. I guess there isn't now, and I'll tell you how I found my wife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I do remain," [...] {{continued}} Alison, [...] "it {{must be as}} I am. I {{would not}} live upon <b>you,</b> even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me,</b> which <b>you</b> have too much sense to do; and though dear Lady Temple is everything to me, and wants me to forget that I am her governess, {{that would be a}} mere shuffle, but if it is best for you that I should give it up, and go out, say so at once." ...|$|R

60|$|I claim yet, as I {{have always}} claimed, that the machine's market (abroad and here together,) is today worth $150,000,000 without saying {{anything}} about the doubling and trebling of this sum that will follow within {{the life of the}} patents. Now here is a queer fact: I am one of the wealthiest grandees in America--one of the Vanderbilt gang, in fact--and yet <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to lend <b>you</b> a couple of dollars I should have to <b>ask</b> <b>you</b> to take my note instead.|$|R
