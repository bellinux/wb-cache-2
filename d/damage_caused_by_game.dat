The aim was processing a literature review on the topic of harm wildlife and processing its own investigation regarding the evaluation of the development of damage to forests, depending on winter feeding and its localization. The first part is introduction to the general problems of dealing with the kind of <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>game,</b> the possibilities of influencing of <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>game,</b> evidence of <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>game,</b> the legislative framework for the application of game damages to the user of the hunting ground and the consequences of <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>game.</b> The second part is focused on the investigation of <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>game</b> in selected locations. It was selected two adjacent hunting grounds in the selected area of a similar nature and properties. In the first hunting ground were selected three feeding sites and in the second hunting ground other two feeding sites. Around each location was determined by a circle with a radius of one kilometre and using a map portal comprise forests within this sector in the table. For each crop was determined actual age, the percentage of crop damage and the distance from feeding place. Data for damage based on the summaries damage to forests in Forest enterprise Boubín, forest district Kubova Huť and from 2010 to 2014. The statistical method, using the statistical software STATISTICA 10 th 0., the data were evaluated and put into final tables and chapters. The basic hypothesis was based {{on the question of whether}} the damage caused by wild animals increase with bigger distance from the feeding sites. The results did not confirm this hypothesis. Conversely, the damages caused by animals increased with reduced distance from the feeding sites. Neither the size of the crop affects the amount of <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>game.</b> Knowledge about the occurrence of <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>game</b> depends on the distance from feeding sites may be important for better selection and number of sites for animal feeding.

40|$|Liability for <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>game</b> The damage {{liability}} {{poses the}} key and complex issues of civil substantive law with some aspects not yet properly investigated. The civil liability may have various forms and it demonstrates in {{a whole range of}} social relationships, which the doctrine tries to reflect by its systematisation and categorisation. In this respect, for damage caused by animals as special entity presents a specific case liability. <b>Damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>game</b> can be considered as special case mainly as the harmful agent is a living organism, of which the behaviour cannot be predicted to a certain extent. Since 1 January 2014, however, the civil-law regulations take the liability for damage caused by animals explicitly into account and assume that the persons responsible should be the owner of the respective animal or the actual holder. The concept of the liability is based on the owner or holder being aware or related risks and hence acting in a way preventing the animal to cause damage. While the Civil Code effective from 1 January 2014 regulates the liability for damage caused by animals that is owned by somebody and hence compensates the deficit of previous regulations, the liability for <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>game</b> is very problematic and not regulated sufficiently; damage cause by game poses [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The diploma thesis {{concerns}} the legal regulation of {{hunting in the}} Czech Republic. The subject of this thesis is to analyse and critically review of valid and effective legislation. The thesis is divided into 4 main chapters which are further sub-divided into the subchapters. The chapter 3 as {{a crucial part of}} the thesis deals with the Act No. 449 / 2001 Coll., on Hunting, as amended. The thesis is primarily focusing on wild game and its ownership, rights and duties of hunting guards, hunting management and importance of hunting management plan and issues relating to overpopulation of specific types of wild cloven-hoofed game which is connected with a liability for <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>game...</b>|$|E

40|$|The work {{is devoted}} to the {{evaluation}} of the status and trends of the SP Valšovice. The forest regeneration was evaluated according to the economic records and field research. On the base of the LHO there have been, for the last 10 years, researched: the state and development of tree species, the proportion of trees in the regeneration, the increase of game damages to forests, the development of costs of protecting cultures and particularities of the extreme locations. In the ŠP Valšovice, the most represented tree species is beech (38 %), followed by spruce (28 %) and larch, which represents 15 % of the LHC area. There is a significant decline in the representation of spruce in ten years, which is almost 5 %. For the regeneration, the most applied is beech (59 %), followed by spruce (20 %), oak (11 %) and fir (6 %). The share of natural regeneration is, on average 16. 9 %. As for the particular tree species, larch is naturally regenerated (100 %), and beech (22 %). Conversely JD is regenerated only artificially. The major problem in reforestation represents the restoration of beech to calamity clearings and <b>damages</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>game.</b> In the case of calamity clearings, beech is replaced by other trees, especially oak. <b>Damages</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>game</b> are solved <b>by</b> increasing the surface treated with paint, building better fences at a rather smaller area and increasing hunting based on authorization from the competent government authority.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{addresses the}} developmental dynamics of natural regeneration in uneven-aged fir-beech {{forest in the}} Western Carpathians. The primary {{attention was paid to}} silver fir (Abies alba Mill.). One of the crucial reasons for writing this thesis was an attempt to contribute to the knowledge about long-term proportion decrease of silver fir with simultaneous increasing dominance of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) during the 20 th century. Structure and species composition changes of natural regeneration were investigated within the measurement period 2009 [...] 2013. Research data was acquired with two inventory methods - the circular inventory plots and the line transect. Silver fir does not almost exceed a height of 0, 5 m despite sufficient quantities of natural regeneration of initial stages. The <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>game</b> is regarded as the most limiting factor. Natural regeneration is dominated by beech above a height of 0, 15 m. The low rate of browsing does not prevent it from further development. The growth and the regeneration dynamics of trees is species-dependent, nevertheless, there is a decreasing tendency of natural regeneration quantities of all tree species up to 0, 15 m in height since 2010...|$|E
40|$|The {{supplementary}} {{winter feeding}} {{is a widespread}} practice in Europe and parts of North America. The role of feeding is maintenance of high game population density, maintenance of body condition or reduction of winter mortality. Feeding may also be carried out to reduce the environmental <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>game</b> species during winter. The secondary products from the food industry can provide potential winter extra-food for game species due to their relatively low price and valuable nutrient content. To know whether these secondary products can be utilisable food for game we collected information about the diet composition of game species. Actually, we investigated the proportion of tomato pulp silage in the diet of different large game species in intensively managed game preserves during winter. The study {{was carried out in}} two game preserves (Bodony and Bárna). The study was conducted in Bodony from November 2009 to March 2010. In this period 23 bales of tomato pulp silage (each was one ton) were placed on three different feeding plots in the game preserve. In Bárna investigations were carried out between December 2010 and May 2011. In this game preserve 44 bales of tomato pulp silage were placed on six feeders. We collected faecal droppings of different large game species around feeders and along transects between them. The diet composition of game species was determined by microhistological faeces analysis. In both areas all amples investigated contained of tomato. In approx. 60...|$|E

Parliament responded with the Agricultural Holdings (England) Act 1883, which prevented contracting out on terms less favourable than a normal tenancy. Subsequent Agricultural Holdings Acts in 1900 and 1906 further refined the dispute resolution procedure; required landlords to compensate tenants for their damaged crops if the <b>damage</b> was <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>game</b> that the landlord did not allow tenants to kill; allowed tenants to choose for themselves what crops to grow, except {{in the last year}} of the tenancy; and prevented penal rents being charged except in special circumstances.

40|$|In {{the recent}} years the <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> the <b>game</b> animals to the {{agricultural}} crops has increased considerably. An immediate cause of this situation is an expanding population of big game, especially wild boar. This increase is primarily due to the changes in agrocenoses, dominated by large area maize cropping. The crop damage is compensated by hunting associations leasing the specific areas. The aim {{of this paper was}} to present the costs of the compensation incurred by the lease-holders of the hunting grounds. A cause - effect relationship between greater game damage and increased harvest of the game animals was demonstrated. The analysis was based on the data provided in the Statistical Yearbooks of the Central Statistical Office for 2000 - 2013. The study also indicated a problem of a decline in roe deer population, <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> more intense harvest resulting from farmer compensation claims. ...|$|R

40|$|Legal {{regulations}} concerning wildlife {{damage in}} Germany are totally different from regulations in the United States. In certain cases German game laws provide {{the right to}} compensation for wildlife damage to forests for forest owners. But not everyone has to be compensated. Liability exists only for <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> hooved <b>game,</b> rabbits, and pheasants, and only to important local tree species (Hauptholzarten). If, for example, red deer damage an afforestation of Norway spruce (Picea abies) by browsing, normally the shooting tenant has {{to compensate for the}} damage. The most important types of damage to forests in Germany are browsing and debarking by red deer (Cervus elaphus) and browsing and rubbing by roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). For a forest owner to gain compensation, a special procedure is prescribed in the game laws. If no amicable agreement between shooting tenant and forest owner can be reached, a forest expert has to evaluate the economic damage. Therefore, in Germany, several methods of economic assessment of <b>damage</b> to forests <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> wildlife have been developed. Two methods in use are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this thesis is to assess the {{efficacy}} of two repellent products with active ingredients denatonium benzoate and capsaicin to protect the newly established forest tree planting prior to browsing damage <b>by</b> wild <b>game.</b> Repellents were tested on two different experimental plots planted with silver fir (Abies alba). Application of repellents held in three terms and total three times were the damages, which {{were included in the}} framework of the six-rating scale, has been detected. The effectiveness of these repellents has been demonstrated already during the second term <b>damage</b> assessments <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>game.</b> During the more than 14 -month experiment was damaged almost 2. 5 times fewer seedlings treated with repellents based on denatonium benzoate and capsaicin than untreated seedlings, serving as a control. The most common form of damage to the tree was bitten off terminal bud with little scope of additional damage. Damage to seedlings <b>by</b> <b>game</b> differed significantly even within the investigated areas. Use of repellents did not affect the physiological death of seedlings. It was justify the conclusion that most of the <b>damages</b> were <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). Based on several scientific papers on the efficacy of repellent products based on capsaicin and denatonium benzoate was concluded that the main active ingredient in tested repellents is capsaicin...|$|R
40|$|Ungulates have both, {{advantageous}} and disadvantageous {{effects in}} forest ecosystems. But predominantly, {{there is a}} one-sided negative opinion about their role and impact mainly based on economic <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> these <b>game</b> species. However, we should also always consider their ecological role in forested habitats as ecosystem engineers. We, therefore, aimed to establish a nationwide monitoring of ungulate impact assessing forest-ungulate interactions based on a reliable unified methodology. This monitoring includes measurements of understory woody plant supply and tree-trunk availability to and their utilisation by ungulates; moreover the estimation of forest regeneration and intensity of area use by ungulates. First field studies take place on special areas of conservation (SAC) in Mátra Mountains belonging to the Natura 2000 network and covering about 5000 hectares. Various forest stands will be examined along transects with 100 sample points in each SAC area to ensure the representativity of sampling. The collected data will characterize {{the relationships between the}} relative ungulate density and food availability to herbivores. In this way, the forest-game interactions can be also described. A new monitoring system based on our elaborated methodology will provide regular data from many parts of the Hungarian forests. The spatial and temporal comparisons of those values help us to understand how different ungulate species contribute to the maintenance of natural processes of our forest ecosystems...|$|R
