5|$|Although it is {{not widely}} cultivated, Alloxylon flammeum {{has proven to be}} by far the most hardy and {{adaptable}} (as well as the showiest) member of the genus Alloxylon, and has been grown successfully in as cool a climate as Victoria. It does best in a well-drained soil rich in organic material but low in phosphorus with some shelter when young. Applying mulch to the soil around the plant and extra water in dry spells is beneficial. Fertilisers high in phosphorus content can damage the plant, though fertilisers specifically for Australian native plants can be used.

40|$|There {{are several}} {{scientific}} approaches for {{the determination of}} cellular growth influences of known or novel substances under in vitro conditions, among which colourimetric absorption measurement {{is considered to be}} one of the convenient methods. [3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 5 -(3 -carboxymethoxyphenyl) - 2 - (4 -sulfophenyl) - 2 H-tetrazolium] (MTS) assay is one of the commonly used colourimetric absorption assays based on the ability of dehydrogenase from viable cells to produce the brown soluble formazan detectable at 490 nm. Here we have tested the possible growth influence of <b>iron</b> (II) <b>sulphate</b> on two human cancer cell lines, the K 562 chronic myelogenous leukaemia and T 47 D breast carcinoma cells, based on the MTS assay. We found that <b>iron</b> (II) <b>sulphate</b> possessed an inhibitory effect when added at 16 - to 125 -μM concentrations, but <b>iron</b> (II) <b>sulphate</b> became growth stimulatory when its concentration was further increased to 1000 μM. In addition, a dose-dependent increase in absorbance at the same wavelength was observed when we repeated the experiments without the addition of MTS and phenazine methosulfate. When we further repeated the cell growth determinations using adenosine triphosphate content assay for K 562 and 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay for T 47 D, <b>iron</b> (II) <b>sulphate</b> showed a consistent dose-dependent growth inhibitory effect. Morphological investigation after methylene blue staining clearly demonstrated that <b>iron</b> (II) <b>sulphate,</b> at a concentration of 1000 μM, is cytotoxic to T 47 D cells. Interestingly, a consistent increment for the absorbance at 490 nm was further observed with increased <b>iron</b> (II) <b>sulphate</b> concentration either in the presence or absence of MTS even in a cell-free environment. Thus we conclude that <b>iron</b> (II) <b>sulphate</b> is actually growth inhibitory and even cytotoxic at high concentrations towards the K 562 and T 47 D cancer cells and the paradoxical proliferative activity of <b>iron</b> (II) <b>sulphate</b> on these two cancer cell lines using the MTS assay was solely due to the oxidation of initial pale green iron (II) to brownish iron (III) during incubation in the aqueous condition.

[...] The Rochdale Corporation experimented with Goux's design for several months but settled instead on a system which used smaller pails. [...] Goux's system did, however, find a home in Halifax, where it was used in more than 3,000closets after 1870. [...] The wooden pails used in Halifax were oval in cross-section (about 24 by 19inches) and 16inches deep. [...] Each was lined at the sides and bottom with a mixture of refuse, such as straw, grass, street sweepings, wool, hair, and even seaweed. [...] This lining, which was formed by a special mould and to which sulphate of lime was added, was designed to help remove the smell of urine, slow putrefaction and keep the excreta dry. [...] Pails were collected between 7am and 5:30pm. [...] Members of the public occasionally complained about the smell, which usually occurred when a pail was left to overflow, such as in winter 1875 when severe weather conditions prevented the horse-pulled collection wagons from reaching the closets.|$|E
500|$|The {{science of}} conserving fossil remains {{was in its}} infancy, and new {{techniques}} had to be improvised {{to deal with what}} soon became known as [...] "pyrite disease". Crystalline pyrite in the bones was being oxidized to <b>iron</b> <b>sulphate,</b> accompanied by an increase in volume that caused the remains to crack and crumble. When in the ground, the bones were isolated by anoxic moist clay that prevented this from happening, but when removed into the drier open air, the natural chemical conversion began to occur. To limit this effect, De Pauw immediately, in the mine-gallery, re-covered the dug-out fossils with wet clay, sealing them with paper and plaster reinforced by iron rings, forming in total about six hundred transportable blocks with a combined weight of a hundred and thirty tons. In Brussels after opening the plaster he impregnated the bones with boiling gelatine mixed with oil of cloves as a preservative. Removing most of the visible pyrite he then hardened them with hide glue, finishing with a final layer of tin foil. Damage was repaired with papier-mâché. This treatment had the unintended effect of sealing in moisture and extending the period of damage. In 1932 museum director Victor van Straelen decided that the specimens had to be completely restored again to safeguard their preservation. From December 1935 to August 1936 the staff at the museum in Brussels treated the problem with a combination of alcohol, arsenic, and 390 kilograms of shellac. This combination was intended to simultaneously penetrate the fossils (with alcohol), prevent the development of mold (with arsenic), and harden them (with shellac). The fossils entered a third round of conservation from 2003 until May 2007, when the shellac, hide glue and gelatine were removed and impregnated with polyvinyl acetate and cyanoacrylate and epoxy glues. Modern treatments of this problem typically involve either monitoring the humidity of fossil storage, or, for fresh specimens, preparing a special coating of polyethylene glycol that is then heated in a vacuum pump, so that moisture is immediately removed and pore spaces are infiltrated with polyethelene glycol to seal and strengthen the fossil.|$|E

Slag leach beds are a promising low cost and low maintenance technology for the remediation of AMD compared to potentially expensive and maintain once intensive conventional active methods that entail addition of chemicals to treat AMD. Slags are highly alkaline in nature hence they neutralise acidic water; this in turn leads to reduction of <b>iron</b> and <b>sulphate</b> concentration due to formation of iron precipitates and gypsum at higher pH values. Laboratory experiments were carried out to investigate the possibility of reducing acid, <b>iron</b> and <b>sulphate</b> concentration from synthetic AMD using two types of slag namely the basic oxygen furnace and stainless steel slag.
