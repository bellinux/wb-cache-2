[...] The man ignored its pleas till finally it said tearfully, [...] "All right, you've got the ball, but you don't {{know how to}} keep it. It won't be any <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> For me, it's a terrible loss. I tell you, if you don't give it back, I'll be your enemy forever. If you do give it back though, I'll stick to you like a {{protector}} god." ...|$|E
500|$|The izinDuna {{stayed in}} London {{throughout}} {{the month of}} March, attending a number of dinners in their honour, including one hosted by the Aborigines' Protection Society. The Society {{sent a letter to}} Lobengula, advising him to be [...] "wary and firm in resisting proposals that will not bring <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and your people". The diplomats saw many of the British capital's sights, including London Zoo, the Alhambra Theatre and the Bank of England. Their hosts showed them the spear of the Zulu king Cetshwayo, which now hung on a wall at Windsor Castle, and took them to Aldershot to observe military manoeuvres conducted by Major-General Evelyn Wood, the man who had given this spear to the Queen after routing the Zulus in 1879. Knutsford held two more meetings with the izinDuna, and during the second of these gave them the Queen's reply to Lobengula's letter, which mostly comprised vague assurances of goodwill. Satisfied with this, the emissaries sailed for home.|$|E
500|$|While Yellowcard {{was working}} on their {{upcoming}} album, Lights and Sounds, they developed a character, Holly Wood, {{who served as a}} narrator and protagonist for the album's storyline. The character also came about when the band began writing about their hatred for life in Los Angeles. Vocalist Ryan Key, in discussion of the character, said, [...] "Holly became this person on the record who appears {{in a lot of the}} songs, and at times you love her and at times you hate her. At times she's <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and sometimes she's bad." [...] Violinist Sean Mackin, also in discussion of the character, said: [...] "...Ryan didn’t have a romantic interest in his life and he didn’t want to write 'Only One' again, and he wanted to create something new. A lot of songwriters narrate and create fictional characters... and Holly was a character where sometimes you love her and sometimes you hate her, and she was someone he could get all his emotions out through." [...] Key revealed that the song [...] "Rough Landing, Holly", which features the Holly character, was his [...] "favorite song" [...] from Lights and Sounds.|$|E

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{video to}} [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar" [...] {{was directed by}} Trey Fanjoy, who directed the video for [...] "Tim McGraw". Swift decided to film the video with Fanjoy {{as a result of}} how positive the experience was when filming [...] "Tim McGraw". She appreciated all the preparation techniques that she taught her and stated, [...] "You have to remember the people who were <b>good</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> in the beginning". Swift said the video centered around unrequited love. Some of Swift's associates first believed the video should have been set in a prior era. They then thought about filming the video at a large city. However, Swift {{wanted to go back to}} basics and keep the song's integrity by filming the video in Nashville, Tennessee. American singer and actor Tyler Hilton portrayed Drew. He was cast because of prior interactions with Swift. They had a mutual fondness for each other's music. Taking into account his acting on the television series One Tree Hill and the film Walk the Line (2005), Swift asked him to participate in the video after he attended and performed at one of her concerts. Swift chose Hilton primarily because he accurately presented Drew Hardwick, the fun, funny, fun-loving, blue-eyed boy whom she was friends with and had a huge crush on during high school. The video was filmed in one day in March 2007 at Hume-Fogg High School; the drama room was transformed to simulate a bedroom for the performance scenes.|$|E
