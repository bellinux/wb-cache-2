25|$|McCulley {{writes that}} the {{progression}} through Minsky's three borrowing stages was evident as the credit and housing bubbles built through approximately August 2007.

This helped drive the housing bubble, as the availability of credit encouraged higher <b>home</b> <b>prices.</b> Since the bubble burst, {{we are seeing the}} progression in reverse, as businesses de-leverage, lending standards are raised and the share of borrowers in the three stages shifts back towards the hedge borrower.|$|E
