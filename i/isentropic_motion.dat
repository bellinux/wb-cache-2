We {{study the}} linearized {{stability}} of stationary solutions of gaseous stars {{which are in}} spherically symmetric and <b>isentropic</b> <b>motion.</b> If viscosity is ignored, we have following three types of problems: (EC), Euler equation with a solid core; (EP), Euler{Poisson equation without a solid core; (EPC), Euler{Poisson equation with a solid core. In Lagrangian formulation, we prove that any solution of (EC) is neutrally stable. Any solution of (EP) and (EPC) is also neutrally stable when the adiabatic index γ 2 (4 3; 2) and unstable for (EP) when γ 2 (1;...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem to}} be {{considered}} {{is to determine the}} steady irrotational <b>isentropic</b> <b>motion</b> of a compressible fluid through a region when the normal mass-flow (i. e density times normal velocity) is prescribed over the boundary. For thia hydro-dynamic problem there are given two equivalent problems of the calculus of varia-tions; the integral to be made stationary depends in one case on the velocity potential, and in the other case on the stream function. In the first instance it is required that the region be bounded; but it is shown how the variational formulation may be modified so as to apply to an unbounded region. Here, for definiteness, the case is taken of streaming motion past an aerofoil. Finally it is shown how approximate solutions of the variational problem can be obtained by direct numerical (Rayleigh-Ritz) procedure. Numerical results are given for streaming past a circular cylinder and are compared with those found for the same problem by other methods. 1...|$|E
40|$|In the {{mechanics}} of inviscid conservative fluids, it is classical to generate the equations of dynamics by formulating with adequate variables, that the pressure integral calculated in the time-space domain corresponding to {{the motion of the}} continuous medium is stationary. The present study extends this principle to the dynamics of large deformations for <b>isentropic</b> <b>motions</b> in thermo-elastic bodies: we use a new way of writing the equations of motion in terms of potentials and we substitute the trace of the stress tensor for the pressure term.

40|$|Lagrangian {{material}} line simulations {{are performed}} using U. K. Meteorological Office simulated winds and temperatures to examine mixing {{processes in the}} middle- and lower-stratospheric polar night jet during the 1992 Southern Hemisphere spring and Northern Hemisphere winter. The Lagrangian simulations are undertaken to {{provide insight into the}} effects of mixing within the polar night jet on observations of the polar vortex made by instruments onboard the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) during these periods. A moderate to strong kinematic barrier to large-scale isentropic exchange, similar to the barrier identified in General Circulation Model (GCM) simulations, is identified during both of these periods. Characteristic timescales for mixing by large-scale isentropic motions within the polar night jet range from 20 days in the Southern Hemisphere lower stratosphere to years in the Northern Hemisphere middle stratosphere. The long mixing timescales found in the Northern Hemisphere polar night jet do not persist. Instead, the Northern Hemisphere kinematic barriers are broken down as part of the large-scale stratospheric response to a strong tropospheric blocking event. A series of Lagrangian experiments are conducted to investigate the sensitivity of the kinematic barrier to diabatic effects and to small-scale inertial gravity wave motions. Differential diabatic descent is found to {{have a significant impact on}} mixing processes within the Southern Hemisphere middle-stratospheric jet core. The interaction between small-scale displacements by idealized, inertial gravity waves and the large-scale flow is found to have a significant impact on mixing within the polar night jet in both hemispheres. These sensitivity experiments suggest that scales of motion that are unresolved in global assimilated datasets may contribute to mass exchange across the kinematic barrier to large-scale <b>isentropic</b> <b>motion...</b>|$|E

However, recent interactions with the Springfield, MO National Weather Service Office spurred {{the development of the}} current method of estimating the total ?�??. During the winter of 2012 - 13, this expression was developed into its current form, and initial tests were undertaken to test its usefulness. Using output from NCEP's operational WRF-NAM model, individual points were evaluated for isentropic surfaces RH values > 95 % and compared against the existing isobaric omega (?�) as a truth value. Results show that the difference between ?�?? and ?�, or ADER, performed best on isentropic surfaces closer to the ground, with an overall trend of better performance the further the forecast was from the initialization time. As the area of calculations decreased from 17 x 17 to a 7 x 7 grid-space each at 80 km apart, errors were reduced by nearly an order of magnitude.

40|$|We derive {{a number}} of {{solution}} for one-dimensional dynamics of relativistic magnetized plasma {{that can be used}} as benchmark estimates in relativistic hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic numerical codes. First, we analyze the properties of simple waves of fast modes propagating orthogonally to the magnetic field in relativistically hot plasma. The magnetic and kinetic pressures obey different equations of state, so that the system behaves as a mixture of gases with different polytropic indices. We find the self-similar solutions for the expansion of hot strongly magnetized plasma into vacuum. Second, we derive linear hodograph and Darboux equations for the relativistic Khalatnikov potential, which describe arbitrary one-dimensional <b>isentropic</b> relativistic <b>motion</b> of cold magnetized plasma and find their general and particular solutions. The obtained hodograph and Darboux equations are very powerful: system of highly non-linear, relativistic, time dependent equations describing arbitrary (not necessarily self-similar) dynamics of highly magnetized plasma reduces to a single linear differential equation.

40|$|The moist-air entropy {{can be used}} {{to analyze}} and better {{understand}} the general circulation of the atmosphere or convective <b>motions.</b> <b>Isentropic</b> analyses are commonly based on studies of different equivalent potential temperatures, all of which are assumed to fully represent the entropy of moist air. It is, however, possible to rely either on statistical physics or the third law of thermodynamics when defining and computing the absolute entropy of moist air and to study the corresponding third-law potential temperature, which is different from the previous ones. The third law assumes that the entropy for the most stable crystalline state of all substances is zero when approaching absolute zero temperature. This paper shows that the way all these moist-air potential temperatures are defined has a large impact on: (i) the plotting of the isentropes for a simulation of the Hurricane DUMILE; (ii) the changes in moist-air entropy computed for a steam cycle defined for this Hurricane; (iii) the analyses of isentropic stream functions computed for this Hurricane; and (iv) the computations of the heat input, the work function, and the efficiency defined for this steam cycle. The moist-air entropy is a state function and the isentropic analyses must be completely determined by the local moist-air conditions. The large differences observed between the different formulations of moist-air entropy are interpreted as proof that the isentropic analyses of moist-air atmospheric motions must be achieved by using the third-law potential temperature defined from general thermodynamics.
