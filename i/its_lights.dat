5|$|The band's road manager, Brian Maguire {{stated that}} when he drove away from Banbridge in the lead, a few minutes ahead of the band's minibus, he passed through {{security}} barriers manned by the RUC. As Maguire continued ahead, up the by-pass towards Newry, he noticed a blue Triumph 2000 pulling-out from {{where it had been}} parked in a lay-by. Maguire recalled that the car first slowed down, then it accelerated, flashing <b>its</b> <b>lights.</b> Two men had been observed acting suspiciously inside the Castle Ballroom during the band's performance that night, suggesting that the Miami Showband's movements were being carefully monitored.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two sets}} of {{lighting}} in the top spires and decoration. The first are the V-shaped lighting inserts in the steel of the building itself. Added later were groups of floodlights that are on mast arms directed back at the building. This allows {{the top of the}} building to be lit in many colors for special occasions. The tube lighting atop the building was added in 1981, although it {{had been part of the}} original design. Until 1998 the lights were turned off at 2a.m., but New York Observer columnist Ron Rosenbaum convinced Tishman Speyer to keep the lights on until 6a.m. Since 2015, the Chrysler Building and other city skyscrapers have been part of the Audubon Society's Lights Out program, wherein the building turns off <b>its</b> <b>lights</b> during bird migration seasons.|$|E
5|$|The {{next night}} at 1945 hrs, a craft {{similar to the}} one the night before {{approached}} the base. In addition to being tracked on radar, it hovered around the area for 30 minutes, with characteristics of movement similar to a helicopter. Additionally, it hovered above the weapons storage area at the same altitude as the night before. At this time, possibly another object (it is unclear if it was the same one as the over the weapons storage area, but it is possible) was spotted over the flightline. The cigar-shaped object was described as hovering in mid-air, jerking around, and turning on and off <b>its</b> <b>lights</b> once. During the blackout, it traveled from the flightline, to the northern end of the runway. According to one service member, the object was chased, and eventually discovered to be hovering five feet off the ground. During this time, it was determined that the object was four car lengths long.|$|E
50|$|In 1911, General Electric {{absorbed the}} National Electric Lamp Association (NELA) into <b>its</b> <b>lighting</b> business. GE {{established}} <b>its</b> <b>lighting</b> division headquarters at Nela Park in East Cleveland, Ohio. Nela Park {{is still the}} headquarters for GE's lighting business.|$|R

25|$|The {{aircraft}} began taxiing without {{communicating with}} the control tower. It maneuvered erratically and entered a runway without clearance. The tower officers tried to make contact, {{but there was no}} response; and the tracking transponders were turned off. With <b>its</b> <b>lights</b> off, the aircraft took off, heading southwest over the Atlantic Ocean. Neither the aircraft nor the two men have been seen since.|$|E
25|$|On {{the day he}} died, Broadway dimmed <b>its</b> <b>lights</b> in Jolson's honor, {{and radio}} {{stations}} {{all over the world}} were paying tributes. Soon after his death, the BBC presented a special program entitled Jolson Sings On. His death unleashed tributes from all over the world, including a number of eulogies from friends, including George Jessel, Walter Winchell, and Eddie Cantor. He contributed millions to Jewish and other charities in his will.|$|E

25|$|Charles Kickham was {{the author}} of three {{well-known}} stories, dealing sympathetically with Irish life and manners and the simple faith, the joys and sorrows, the quaint customs and the insuppressible humour of the peasantry. “Knocknagow,” or “The Homes of Tipperary,” one of the finest tales of peasant life ever written, suggests O’Sullivan. “Sally Cavanagh,” or “The Untenanted Graves,” a touching story illustrating the evils of landlordism and emigration; and “For the Old Land,” dealing with the fortunes of a small farmer’s family, with <b>its</b> <b>lights</b> and shades.|$|E

The 72-light S/L layout (at an average separation of 4500 yards, seven rows deep, with Mk VIII Sound locators in the first row) was built up from west to east as 3rd Searchlight Battery arrived.|$|E
25|$|On July 11, 2007, the Mirvish family {{released}} a statement to announce the death of Ed Mirvish after midnight at St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto. The funeral service {{was held at the}} Beth Tzedek Synagogue in Toronto. Mirvish was buried at Pardes Shalom Cemetery in Maple, Ontario. His store was closed and <b>its</b> <b>lights</b> were dimmed, as staff bid farewell to the former owner. A similar gesture was made by theatres on Broadway, which dimmed their lights for one minute at 8pm on July 13. Toronto Police provided ceremonial and mounted units (including the horse Honest Ed) for his funeral. Flags at Toronto's civic centres were lowered to half mast.|$|E

25|$|Gardiner {{maintains}} that on 14 April, First Officer Murdoch (who was not officially on duty yet) {{was on the}} bridge because {{he was one of}} the few high-ranking officers other than Captain Smith who knew of the plan and was keeping a watch out for the rescue ships. One of Gardiner's most controversial statements is that the Titanic did not strike an iceberg, but an IMM rescue ship that was drifting on station with <b>its</b> <b>lights</b> out. Gardiner based this hypothesis on the idea that the supposed iceberg was seen at such a short distance by the lookouts on the Titanic because it was actually a darkened ship, and he also does not believe an iceberg could inflict such sustained and serious damage to a steel double-hulled vessel such as the Titanic.|$|E
25|$|At {{the one to}} go signal, {{the pace}} car will turn <b>its</b> <b>lights</b> off. At this point, any car that is ahead of {{the leader of the}} race will be waved around {{to the rear of the}} field. These cars are not {{permitted}} to pit until after the green flag comes back out and the race has resumed. The field will then line up double file for the restart. The leader of the race gets lane choice, but the third place car (and odd positions on back) will always start in the inside line, while the fourth place car (and even positions on back) will always start in the outside lane. The restart order is always this: Lead Lap Cars > Cars 1 or more laps down > Free Pass Car > Wave Arounds > Cars who have received a penalty.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the murder}} of Burbank police officer Matthew Pavelka in 2003, the city {{experienced}} earlier cases of tragedy involving local law enforcement. Marshal Luther Colson and Deputy City Marshal Robert L. Normand were shot to death while patrolling the city. Their deaths in 1914 and 1920 marked the first time that Burbank police officers were killed in the line of duty. Colson was shot the evening of November 16, 1914, when he was walking on railroad tracks near what is now Victory Place and Lake Street. Six years later, Normand was killed when he responded to a call for help to check on three men in a vehicle with <b>its</b> <b>lights</b> out. The men began shooting as Normand and another officer approached the car. The other officer survived despite three bullet wounds, but Normand died at the scene. Additionally, two other Burbank officers have died on duty. They were motorcycle officers Joseph R. Wilson and Richard E. Kunkle, who were killed in separate accidents in 1961.|$|E

500|$|ILM filmed starships using {{motion control}} for timed and {{computer-assisted}} model movement. The ship models required multiple camera passes because {{different parts of}} the ship and <b>its</b> <b>lights</b> were filmed at different exposure levels. The Excelsior required eight passes to supplement the main [...] "beauty pass", the Enterprise six. ILM could have combined passes with multiple exposures, but not without risk; [...] "If anything got out of synch, or somehow we dropped a frame, we would have to reshoot—and then you're stuck. You've ruined two pieces, two elements," [...] Farrar said.|$|E
500|$|During World War II, {{the statue}} {{remained}} open to visitors, {{although it was}} not illuminated at night due to wartime blackouts. It was lit briefly on December 31, 1943, and on D-Day, June 6, 1944, when <b>its</b> <b>lights</b> flashed [...] "dot-dot-dot-dash", the Morse code for V, for victory. New, powerful lighting was installed in 1944–1945, and beginning on V-E Day, the statue was once again illuminated after sunset. The lighting was for only a few hours each evening, and it was not until 1957 that the statue was illuminated every night, all night. In 1946, the interior of the statue within reach of visitors was coated with a special plastic so that graffiti could be washed away.|$|E
500|$|Hoffman's {{unexpected}} {{death was}} widely lamented by {{fans and the}} film industry, and was described by several commentators as a considerable loss to the profession. On February 5, 2014, the LAByrinth Theatre Company honored his memory by holding a candlelight vigil, and Broadway dimmed <b>its</b> <b>lights</b> for one minute. In another tribute, actress Cate Blanchett dedicated her BAFTA trophy to Hoffman when she received the award for Blue Jasmine on February 16. Three weeks after Hoffman's death, David Bar Katz established the American Playwriting Foundation in the actor's memory. With the money received from a libel lawsuit against the National Enquirer (which had inaccurately published that Hoffman and Katz were lovers), the foundation awards an annual prize of US$45,000 to the author of an unproduced play. Katz named this the [...] "Relentless Prize" [...] in honor of Hoffman's dedication to the profession. Regarding his material legacy, Hoffman left his entire fortune (around US$35 million) to Mimi O'Donnell in his October 2004 will, trusting her to distribute money to their children.|$|E

500|$|As Icehouse, {{the band}} spent {{the second half}} of 1981 touring the UK, Canada and the U.S., whilst Chrysalis {{released}} most of their Flowers material under the name Icehouse. The single [...] "Icehouse" [...] was released in Europe and created some interest in the UK, partly because of a video directed by Russell Mulcahy, while in the U.S. the song peaked at No.28 on the Billboard Top Tracks chart in 1981. [...] "Icehouse" [...] had been written by Davies when he lived at 18 Tryon Road, Lindfield in an old, cold flat of a two-storey mansion - across the street was a dishevelled house which had <b>its</b> <b>lights</b> on all night peopled by short-term residents. Davies later learned it was a half-way house for psychiatric and drug rehab patients. The first U.S. single [...] "We Can Get Together" [...] peaked at No.62 on the Billboard Hot 100. A single-only release, [...] "Love in Motion", was recorded by Davies using the Sequential Circuits Prophet 5, and became the first new recording credited to Icehouse; it hit the Australian Top 10 in November 1981. Icehouse split up late in 1981, Keith Welsh later becoming manager of Australian bands Do-Ré-Mi and Boom Crash Opera.|$|E

2500|$|Suppose {{that two}} actors' negligent acts combine to produce {{one set of}} damages, where but for either of their negligent acts, no damage would have {{occurred}} at all. [...] This is two negligences contributing to a single cause, as distinguished from two separate negligences contributing to two successive or separate causes.
