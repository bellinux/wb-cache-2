25|$|In {{order to}} hone {{the manner in}} which things, media and big data are interconnected, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>first</b> <b>necessary</b> to provide some context into the {{mechanism}} used for media process. It has been suggested by Nick Couldry and Joseph Turow that s in media approach big data as many actionable points of information about millions of individuals. The industry appears to be moving away from the traditional approach of using specific media environments such as newspapers, magazines, or television shows and instead tap into consumers with technologies that reach targeted people at optimal times in optimal locations. The ultimate aim is, of course, to serve or convey, a message or content that is (statistically speaking) in line with the consumer's mindset. For example, publishing environments are increasingly tailoring the messages (articles) to appeal to consumers that have been exclusively gleaned through various data-mining activities.|$|E

[...] There was no official census of the population to [...] provide this figure, and the best contemporary [...] count comes {{from the work of}} John Graunt (1620–1674), who was [...] one of the earliest Fellows of the Royal Society {{and one of the first}} [...] demographers, bringing a scientific approach to the collection of statistics. In 1662, he estimated [...] that 384,000 people lived in the City of London, the Liberties, Westminster and the out-parishes, based on figures in the [...] bills of mortality published each week in the capital. These different districts with different administrations constituted the officially recognised extent of London as a whole. In 1665, he revised his estimate to 'not above 460,000'. Other contemporaries put the figure higher, (the French Ambassador, for example, suggested 600,000) but with no mathematical basis to support their estimates. The next largest city in the kingdom was Norwich, with a population of 30,000.|$|E

2500|$|For example, {{one common}} rule of {{inference}} {{is the rule}} of substitution. If t is a term and φ is a formula possibly containing the variable x, then φ {{is the result of}} replacing all free instances of x by t in φ. The substitution rule states that for any φ and any term t, one can conclude φ from φ provided that no free variable of t becomes bound during the substitution process. (If some free variable of t becomes bound, then to substitute t for x <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>first</b> <b>necessary</b> to change the bound variables of φ to differ from the free variables of t.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Remark: Suppose G = ⟨X|R⟩ is a finitely {{presented}} {{group with}} solvable word problem and H is a finite subset G. Let H* = ⟨H⟩, be the group generated by H. Then the word problem in H* is solvable: given two words h, k in the generators H of H*, write them as words in X and compare them using {{the solution to}} the word problem in G. It is easy to think that this demonstrates a uniform solution the word problem for the class K (say) of finitely generated groups that can be embedded in G. If this were the case the non-existence of a universal solvable word problem group would follow easily from Boone-Rogers. However, solution just exhibited for the word problem for groups in K is not uniform. To see this consider a group J = ⟨Y|T⟩ ∈ K, in order to use the above argument to solve the word problem in J, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>first</b> <b>necessary</b> to exhibit a mapping [...] e: Y → G that extends to an embedding e*: [...] J → G. If there were a recursive function that mapped (finitely generated) presentations of groups in K to embeddings into G, then a uniform solution the word problem in K could indeed be constructed. But there is no reason, in general, to suppose that such a recursive function exists. However, it turns out that, using a more sophisticated argument, the word problem in J can be solved without using an embedding e: J → G. Instead an enumeration of homomorphisms is used, and since such enumeration can be constructed uniformly, it results in a uniform solution to the word problem in K.|$|E

60|$|In short {{the fear}} of the Jews in Palestine, {{reasonable}} or unreasonable, is a thing that must be answered by reason. It is idle for the unpopular thing to answer with boasts, especially boasts of the very quality that makes it unpopular. But I think it could be answered by reason, or at any rate tested by reason; and the tests by consideration. The principle is still as stated above; that the tests must not merely insist on the virtues the Jews do show, but rather deal with the particular virtues which they are generally accused of not showing. It is necessary to understand this more thoroughly than it is generally understood, and especially better than it is usually stated in the language of fashionable controversy. For the question involves the whole success or failure of Zionism. Many of the Zionists know it; but I rather doubt whether most of the Anti-Zionists know that they know it. And some of the phrases of the Zionists, such as those that I have noted, too often tend to produce the impression that they ignore when they are not ignorant. They are not ignorant; and they do not ignore in practice; even when an intellectual habit makes them seem to ignore in theory. Nobody who has seen a Jewish rural settlement, such as Rishon, can doubt that some Jews are sincerely filled with the vision of sitting under their own vine and fig-tree, and even with its accompanying lesson that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>first</b> <b>necessary</b> to grow the fig-tree and the vine.|$|E
60|$|We {{come now}} to the Himalayan breed, which is {{sometimes}} called Chinese, Polish, or Russian. These pretty rabbits are white, or occasionally yellow, excepting their ears, nose, feet, and the upper side of the tail, which are all brownish-black; but as they have red eyes, they may be considered as albinoes. I have received several accounts of their breeding perfectly true. From their symmetrical marks, they were at first ranked as specifically distinct, and were provisionally named L. nigripes. (4/14. 'Proc. Zoolog. Soc.' June 23, 1857 page 159.) Some good observers thought that they could detect {{a difference in their}} habits, and stoutly maintained that they formed a new species. The origin of this breed is so curious, both in itself and as throwing some light on the complex laws of inheritance that it is worth giving in detail. But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>first</b> <b>necessary</b> briefly to describe two other breeds: silver-greys or silver-sprigs generally have black heads and legs, and their fine grey fur is interspersed with numerous black and white long hairs. They breed perfectly true, and have long been kept in warrens. When they escape and cross with common rabbits, the product, as I hear from Mr. Wyrley Birch, of Wretham Hall, is not a mixture of the two colours, but about half take after the one parent, and the other half after the other parent. Secondly, chinchillas or tame silver-greys (I will use the former name) have short, paler, mouse or slate-coloured fur, interspersed with long, blackish, slate-coloured, and white hairs. (4/15. 'Journal of Horticulture' April 9, 1861 page 35.) These rabbits breed perfectly true. A writer stated in 1857 (4/16. 'Cottage Gardener' 1857 page 141.) that he had produced Himalayan rabbits in the following manner. He had a breed of chinchillas which had been crossed with the common black rabbit, and their offspring were either blacks or chinchillas. These latter were again crossed with other chinchillas (which had also been crossed with silver-greys), and from this complicated cross Himalayan rabbits were raised. From these and other similar statements, Mr. Bartlett (4/17. Mr. Bartlett in 'Proc. Zoolog Soc.' 1861 page 40.) was led to make a careful trial in the Zoological Gardens, and he found that by simply crossing silver-greys with chinchillas he could always produce some few Himalayans; and the latter, notwithstanding their sudden origin, if kept separate, bred perfectly true. But I have recently been assured the pure silver-greys of any sub-breed occasionally produce Himalayans.|$|E
