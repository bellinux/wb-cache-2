2500|$|Approximately {{three dozen}} {{people came to}} the 1st Golden Raspberry Awards. The 2nd Golden Raspberry Awards had double the {{attendance}} as the first, and the 3rd awards ceremony had double this number. By the 4th Golden Raspberry Awards ceremony, CNN and two major wire services covered the event. Wilson realized that by scheduling the Golden Raspberry Awards prior to the Academy Awards, the ceremony would get more press coverage: [...] "We finally figured out you couldn't compete with the Oscars on Oscar night, but if you went the night before, when the press {{from all over the}} world are here and they are looking <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> it could well catch on," [...] he said to BBC News.|$|E
2500|$|While in the U.S., Michael {{travels to}} New York {{to visit the}} Jewish woman who was a witness at the trial, and who wrote the book about the winter death march from Auschwitz. She can see his terrible {{conflict}} of emotions and he finally tells of his youthful relationship with Hanna. The unspoken damage she left to the people around her hangs in the air. He reveals his short, cold marriage, and his distant relationship with his daughter. The woman understands, but nonetheless refuses to take the savings Hanna had asked Michael to convey to her, saying, [...] "Using it <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with the Holocaust would really seem like an absolution to me, {{and that is something}} I neither wish nor care to grant." [...] She asks that he donate it as he sees fit; he chooses a Jewish charity for combating illiteracy, in Hanna's name. Having had a caddy stolen from her {{when she was a child}} in the camp, the woman does take the old tea caddy in which Hanna had kept her money and mementos. Returning to Germany, and with a letter of thanks for the donation made in Hanna's name, Michael visits Hanna's grave for the first and only time.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's easy enough, and I {{like the}} idea, I'm aching <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> that is, some new amusement, you know," [...] added Jo quickly.|$|E
5000|$|He regards {{himself as}} [...] "a failed jazz musician, {{scrambling}} about <b>for</b> <b>something</b> else <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with his life".|$|R
50|$|Yellows are enthusiastic. They {{are very}} persuasive. They are {{spontaneous}} in nature. They {{are always looking}} <b>for</b> <b>something</b> new <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|R
60|$|Isa. I would devise <b>something</b> <b>for</b> him <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> {{which he}} could not {{possibly}} perform.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, let's have a game, then. Anything <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Curse this rain! We {{shall be}} cooped up here till dinner at this rate." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{the people}} looked at one another, waiting <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> not knowing where to begin. Their eyes were {{beginning}} to flame, and their hands to itch for destruction. Checco saw their feeling, and at once pointed to the Palace.|$|E
60|$|The lamp came in, and Phoebe {{held out}} her hands <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and was {{instantly}} provided with a child's frock, while Miss Charlecote read to her one of Fouque's shorter tales by way of supplying the element of chivalrous imagination which was wanting in the Beauchamp system of education.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{the gruesome}} details, the murder was also sensational because it exposed the seedy London underworld of {{gambling}} and amateur boxing {{to a public}} ignorant of it. As more details were published of the underworld which Thurtell and Weare had inhabited, there were increasing calls <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> be <b>done.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, Emily, is the {{sovereign}} forthcoming? I am going directly, <b>for</b> Frank has <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> at Raynham, and William {{is going to}} try his gray in the phaeton.' ...|$|R
60|$|CONFUCIUS. I forgot. There is <b>something</b> <b>for</b> you <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this morning. You {{have to go}} to the Record Office {{to receive}} the American barbarian.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course, {{unless you}} count the mosquitoes. They were nearly {{as big as the}} men. After I had to lie doggo I began to look <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and I was great pals with a man called Hicksey in the Police, the best man that ever stepped on earth; a {{first-class}} man." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{were times}} when {{she seemed to be}} casting about in her mind <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that would please him, and then she would bring pieces of paper to him, and pen and ink, and tell him to write. She thought this very clever of her, and {{expected}} to be praised for it.|$|E
6000|$|When {{the latter}} left, he {{suddenly}} {{discovered that he}} was wasting his time sadly, and told his mother that he meant to look out <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> With this end in view he set out for London, that mighty hive of industry and idleness into {{which there is a}} ceaseless flow of men who [...] "want something to do," [...] and of men who [...] "don't know what to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is very easy," [...] {{said the}} magician, with a sigh. [...] "I really wish, Mr. Mayor, {{that you would}} find <b>something</b> <b>for</b> me <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that is difficult." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mrs. Egremont told us {{that our}} people are very good to us,' said Annaple, 'and don't mean to send us out with nothing but a pack at our backs. It is very kind in them and in you, Mr. Dutton, to take the trouble of it! No, I'll not worry you with thanks. The great point is, hope <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>for</b> Mark <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> That will keep up his spirits best! Poor Mr. Greenleaf is so melancholy that it is all I can <b>do</b> <b>to</b> keep {{him up to the}} mark.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Mr. Easy Peasy (performed by Nigel Plaskitt) - Mr. Easy Peasy {{came into}} Mopatop's Shop in [...] "Easy Peasy" [...] looking <b>for</b> <b>something</b> hard <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> His puppet is a {{recycled}} {{version of an}} unnamed monster (later named Pokey on the [...] "Muppet Takeover" [...] episode of The Today Show) {{that appeared in the}} Prince episode of Muppets Tonight during the [...] "Tales from the Vet" [...] segment.|$|R
60|$|DEAR MR. HADDON,--I {{am pleased}} to see your hand again, and, waiting my wife's return, to guess {{at some of the}} contents. For various things have befallen me of late. First, as you see, I had to change my hand; lastly I have fallen into a kind of blindness, and cannot read. This more {{inclines}} me <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> to answer your letter before I have read it, a safe plan familiar to diplomatists.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought of}} it one day when I was in Folkestone. I {{thought of it}} one day when I was looking in at a window. I see a chap dressin' a window and he was whistlin' reg'lar light-'arted.... I thought then I'd like to keep a bookshop, any'ow, jest <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> And when people weren't about, then you could sit and read the books. See? It wouldn't be 'arf bad."...|$|E
60|$|At {{six o'clock}} {{next morning the}} Clarks were up, one {{to go to his}} work, the other to make him his breakfast. When they had left the bedroom Fan also got up and dressed herself in all haste, and after waiting till she heard the man leave the house, she went into the next room, and Mrs. Clark gave her some coffee and bread, and {{expressed}} surprise at seeing her up so early. Fan answered that she was going out to look <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Betimes I was {{stirred by}} invalid longings <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> eat that <b>did</b> not {{come under the}} caption of [...] "grub." [...] I had visions of the {{maternal}} pantry [...] "deep as first love, and wild with all regret," [...] and then I asked: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mark! Oh, he is abroad. Poor fellow, I wish {{we could}} find <b>something</b> <b>for</b> him <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Lady Fotheringham asked her nephew, Percival, {{if he could not}} put him in the way of getting some appointment.' ...|$|R
30|$|So {{you could}} move a little bit… You could {{actually}} start to require more provision <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> be <b>done,</b> but I don’t think the [Victorian] government {{would want to}} be in the position of dictating to the councils what services they should provide to their community. If anything, the state government, well my department, would probably prefer it to be somewhere else because the Domestic Animals Act brings in all those restricted breed dog/controversial issues, puppy farms and control.|$|R
60|$|Glancing {{about the}} room <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> she saw {{a sheet of paper}} lying exactly out of reach, where it had fluttered from the table unperceived. At first her eye rested on it as {{carelessly}} as it did on the stray stamp Frank had dropped; then, as if one thing suggested the other, she took it into her head that the paper was Frank's composition, or, better still, a note to Annette, for the two corresponded when absence or weather prevented the daily meeting at school.|$|E
6000|$|CONFUCIUS. He {{says he has}} invented such a method. For {{some reason}} which is not intelligible in China, Englishmen always believe any {{statement}} made by an American inventor, especially one who has never invented anything. Therefore you believe this person and have given him a public reception. Today the Record Office is entertaining him with a display of the cinematographic records of all the eminent Englishmen {{who have lost their}} lives by drowning since the cinema was invented. Why not go to see it if you are at a loss <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do?</b> ...|$|E
60|$|The calmness {{with which}} she had {{dismissed}} him puzzled Jimmy as he went away. He wondered whether he had offended her. He had, no doubt, behaved in an unmannerly way, {{but there was no}} other course open. Indeed, it was fortunate that he had kept his head, and she might come to see that it was consideration for her that had influenced him. Then he reflected bitterly that she might not trouble herself any further about the matter {{and that it would be}} more useful if he resumed his search <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
50|$|Despite {{attempts}} at {{reorganization of the}} Air Board, the earlier problems failed to be completely resolved. In addition, {{the growing number of}} German air raids against Great Britain led to public disquiet and increasing demands <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> be <b>done.</b> As a result, Lloyd George, the British Prime Minister, established a committee composed of himself and General Jan Smuts, which was tasked with investigating the problems with the British air defences and organizational difficulties which had beset the Air Board.|$|R
5000|$|... 50. THE GLOBE Full {{of energy}} and looking <b>for</b> <b>something</b> fun <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> Paz and Dog go to visit Pappy. But Pappy's taking a nap so the two boys go into Pappy's garage full of mementos from around the world. Their enthusiasm gets out of hand and a globe becomes a soccer ball, which ends with Dog putting his head through the globe, and Pappy walking in to find the two guilty boys {{fighting}} over whose fault it was...|$|R
5000|$|The June 13 1889 lynching of Tennyson and Devin in Corydon sparked {{an outcry}} <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> be <b>done</b> about the vigilantes. Two men {{suspected}} of attempted murder {{were being held}} in the county jail {{when a group of}} about 200 men, described as orderly and purposeful, dragged them from their cells and hung them from a nearby bridge. The victims were stoic throughout. [...] The guilt of the men was not widely accepted, and many believed they had been killed unfairly and deserved a trial.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Burke {{established}} {{himself in the}} Thorpedyke house, which he immediately repaired from top to bottom; but although he frequently repeated to himself and to his acquaintances that he had now set up housekeeping in just {{the way that he}} had always wished for, with plenty of servants to do everything just as he wanted it done, he was not happy nevertheless. He felt the loss of the stirring occupation which had so delighted him, and his active mind continually looked right and left <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Nope." [...] Father was wonderfully {{bored and}} superior. Surely not this Seth Appleby but a twin of his, a weak-kneed {{inferior}} twin, had loafed in Tompkins Square and wavered through the New York slums, longing <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> He didn't really {{mean to be}} curt, but his chief business in life was to get his shoes and hurry back to Mother, who was waiting for him, a mile from town, at a farm where the lordly Father had strung fence-wire and told high-colored stories for his breakfast.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile, the son {{whom he had}} disinherited {{had grown}} poorer and poorer. He {{and his wife were}} always looking out <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and never spent a penny that they could help, but luck was against them, and {{at the time of his}} father's death they had hardly bread to eat or clothes to cover them. If there had been only himself, he would have managed to get on somehow, but he could not bear to watch his {{children}} becoming weaker day by day, and swallowing his pride, at length he crossed the mountains to his old home where his brother was living.|$|E
5000|$|The hotel {{became a}} {{destination}} for the international elite, King Edward VII of the UK stayed at the hotel {{several times in the}} 1900s. He described his rooms as charming, and found that the sea air relieved his breathing difficulties, however he complained that Biarritz itself was smelly, and asked <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> be <b>done</b> about the drains. In April 1908, H. H. Asquith came to the hotel for the king to make him prime minister of the UK in succession to Henry Campbell-Bannerman, who was dying.|$|R
50|$|When not ring announcing or commentating, McGuirk's job was {{producing}} promos back stage. She explained {{in an interview}} that Vince McMahon would not let his employees just sit around back stage, he would always find <b>something</b> <b>for</b> them <b>to</b> <b>do</b> while being paid.|$|R
60|$|The {{stranger}} {{was left}} in a handsomely furnished waiting room while the soldier went to announce him. It so happened that at this hour His Majesty was at leisure and greatly bored <b>for</b> want of <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> so he ordered his visitor to be shown at once into his throne room.|$|R
