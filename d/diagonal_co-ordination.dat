40|$|The {{extent to}} which co-ordinated rhythmical {{patterns}} of locomotory movement are {{to be regarded as}} expressions of intrinsic activity within the central nervous system, and how far they are dependent upon the patterns of impulses received from peripheral sense organs, remains a fundamental problem in general physiology. In previous communications we have discussed this problem with reference to the ambulatory activity of Amphibia (Gray & Lissmann, 1940). We found that when the limbs and body of a toad {Bufo bufo) are desensitized by severance of their sensory nerves, the effect on the locomotory pattern depends to a very marked degree upon the {{extent to which}} the process of de-afFerentation has been applied to the whole of the somatic musculature. In conformity with the results obtained by previous investigators (Hering, 1893; Weiss, 1936) we found that de-afferentation of either one or two limbs did not substantially affect the co-ordinated, diagonal pattern of limb movements. When three limbs were de-afferentated the ambulatory activity of the animal was substantially reduced; nevertheless, the <b>diagonal</b> <b>co-ordination</b> of the limbs was maintained whenever movement occurred.
