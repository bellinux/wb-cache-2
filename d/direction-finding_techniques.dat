Ground-based systems use triangulation from multiple locations to determine distance, while mobile systems estimate distance using signal frequency and attenuation. Space-based detectors on satellites can be used to locate lightning range, bearing and intensity by direct observation.|$|E

We applied radio <b>direction-finding</b> <b>techniques</b> to observations from the STEREO and Wind spacecraft, the results of which were interpreted using white-light coronagraphic measurements for context. The results of the multiple radio-direction finding techniques applied {{were found to be}} consistent both {{with each other and with}} those derived from the white-light observations of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The results suggest that the Type II burst radio emission is causally related to the CMEs interaction...|$|E
40|$|Global {{measurements}} of large, optically bright lightning events from the Optical Transient Detector (OTD) satellite {{are used to}} validate estimates of lightning location from single-station Schumann resonance (SR) data. Bearing estimates are obtained through conventional magnetic <b>direction-finding</b> <b>techniques,</b> while source range is estimated from the range-dependent impedance spectrum of individual SR transients. An analysis of 40 such transients suggests that single-station techniques can locate lightning globally with an accuracy of 1 - 2 mm. This is confirmed by further validation at close ranges from flashes detected by the National Lightning Detection-Network (NLDN). Observations with both OTD and SR systems may be useful for globally locating lightning with necessary, if not sufficient, characteristics to trigger mesospheric sprites...|$|E

40|$|A <b>direction-finding</b> <b>technique</b> for {{wide-band}} impulsive {{electromagnetic interference}} is presented. An experimental investigation was performed using a spark generator as the impulsive noise source. The signals were captured using a two-antenna array directly sampled at 1 Gs/s. A {{digital signal processing}} based correlation technique allowed assessment of the time delay between the antennas. The results in a nonideal radio propagation environment show the bearing can be estimated to an accuracy of 20...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{two-dimensional}} direction-finding measurements for three type III solar radio bursts is presented {{which is based}} on spin-modulation measurements from two satellites (IMP 8 and Hawkeye I) whose spin axes were nearly perpendicular to each other. The two-dimensional <b>direction-finding</b> <b>technique</b> is combined with a model of the solar-wind plasma density in order to provide determinations of type III source locations out of the ecliptic plane as well as information on the three-dimensional structure of the solar magnetic field at radial distances of 0. 2 to 1. 0 AU from the sun. The <b>direction-finding</b> <b>technique</b> is described in detail, characteristics of the bursts observed by the two satellites are summarized, and the solar-wind model is outlined. The results show that the source locations follow an Archimedean spiral when projected onto the ecliptic plane but usually follow a constant heliocentric latitude perpendicular to that plane. It is also found that measured source sizes are a factor of two larger than the angular sizes of previously reported solar-flare electron emissions, that the spin-modulation factor tends to be largest near the beginning of a type III event, and that the arrival direction of the radiation varies systematically during an event...|$|R
40|$|In a {{case study}} (June 6 - 7, 2008) we report on how the {{internal}} structure of a coronal mass ejection (CME) at 1 AU can be anticipated from remote observations of white-light images of the heliosphere. Favorable circumstances are the absence of fast equatorial solar wind streams and a low CME velocity which allow us to relate the imaging and in-situ data in a straightforward way. The STEREO-B spacecraft encountered typical signatures of a magnetic flux rope inside an interplanetary CME (ICME) whose axis was inclined at 45 ◦ to the solar equatorial plane. Various CME <b>direction–finding</b> <b>techniques</b> yield consistent results to within 15 ◦. Further, remote images from STEREO-A show that (1) the CME is unambiguously connected to the ICME and can be tracked {{all the way to}} 1 AU, (2) the particular arc-like morphology of the CME points to an inclined axis, and (3) the three–part structure of the CME may be plausibly related to the in situ data. This is a first step in predicting both the direction of travel and the internal structure of CMEs from complete remote observations between the Sun and 1 AU, {{which is one of the}} main requirements for forecasting the geo-effectiveness of CMEs.

40|$|Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are {{large-scale}} eruptions of magnetized plasma {{that may}} cause severe geomagnetic storms if Earth-directed. Here we report a rare instance with comprehensive in situ and remote sensing observa- tions of a CME combining white-light, radio, and plasma measurements from four different vantage points. For the first time, we have successfully applied a radio <b>direction-finding</b> <b>technique</b> to an interplanetary type II burst detected by two identical widely separated radio receivers. The derived {{locations of the}} type II and type III bursts are in general agreement with the white light CME recon- struction. We find that the radio emission arises from the flanks of the CME, and are most likely associated with the CME-driven shock.

40|$|Progress {{has been}} made in {{continuing}} efforts to develop optical flight-control and navigation sensors for miniature robotic aircraft. The designs of these sensors are inspired by the designs and functions of the vision systems and brains of insects. Two types of sensors of particular interest are polarization compasses and ocellar horizon sensors. The basic principle of polarization compasses was described (but without using the term "polarization compass") in "Insect-Inspired Flight Control for Small Flying Robots" (NPO- 30545), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 29, No. 1 (January 2005), page 61. To recapitulate: Bees use sky polarization patterns in ultraviolet (UV) light, caused by Rayleigh scattering of sunlight by atmospheric gas molecules, as direction references relative to the apparent position of the Sun. A robotic <b>direction-finding</b> <b>technique</b> based on this concept would be more robust in comparison with a technique based on the direction to the visible Sun because the UV polarization pattern is distributed across the entire sky and, hence, is redundant and can be extrapolated from a small region of clear sky in an elsewhere cloudy sky that hides the Sun...|$|R
40|$|A new radio <b>direction-finding</b> (DF) <b>technique</b> which applies matched-filter {{theory to}} the DF problem is presented. The new technique, called Matched-Filter Doppler Direction Finding (MFD DF) {{is based on}} the doppler DF {{principle}} in which a rotating antenna, or its equivalent, superimposes periodic frequency modulation on the received carrier. The phase of the induced modulation contains information on the angle of arrival. It is shown that a bandpass filtering operation, which satisfies the phase-matching requirement of a matched filter, converts the frequency-modulated signal to an amplitude-modulated signal whose envelope is a periodic narrow pulse with no sidelobes. The relative time of occurrence of the pulse is a measure of angle of arrival. Included is the description of and results obtained with an experimental system used to confirm the analytical results, to study the effects of noise, and to explore alternatives available in the design of an operating system. Encouraging results were obtained using this same experimental system with a conventional operating doppler DF set.
