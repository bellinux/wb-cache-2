5000|$|The Black Shadow, {{capable of}} 125 mi/h km/h, and easily {{recognised}} {{by the black}} coating on the <b>engine</b> and <b>gearbox</b> <b>unit</b> known as Pylumin, and large 150 mi/h km/h speedometer, was introduced. The engine produced [...] @ 5700 rpm in Black Shadow trim.|$|R
50|$|The <b>engine</b> and <b>gearbox</b> <b>unit</b> {{had four}} live rubber {{mountings}} and the silencer and exhaust pipe were similarly insulated. The frame was rigidly cross braced with the deep side members dropped {{in order to}} give a low body mounting. Where the cross bracings ran into the side members they were welded to form a box section which gave stiffness.|$|R

50|$|IWL's first {{production}} model, {{named the}} Pitty, was launched early in 1955 at a retail price of 2,300 Marks. The Pittys front wheel had leading link suspension, while its rear wheel had hydraulically damped swingarm suspension {{on which the}} <b>engine</b> and <b>gearbox</b> <b>unit</b> was mounted: an arrangement that Vespa had pioneered. However, IWL followed West German practice in mounting the engine {{in front of the}} rear wheel instead of beside it, thus giving the Pitty a much longer wheelbase than its Italian counterparts.|$|R
50|$|The Tatra T11 had its <b>engine</b> and <b>gearbox</b> in <b>unit,</b> {{bolted to}} the front of a tubular {{backbone}} with propeller shaft enclosed, that also doubled as the chassis. Bolted {{to the rear of the}} backbone is a final drive unit that, using an assembly of gears, not only changes the direction and speed of the drive, but facilitate the movement of swing axles without the need for flexible drive joints.|$|R
5000|$|While the new car's chassis {{is little}} {{changed from the}} Wizard the engine now {{provides}} Cushioned Power endowed by its new flexible mountings. The <b>engine</b> clutch and <b>gearbox</b> <b>unit</b> is suspended at three points on rubber. The four speed gearbox now has synchromesh between third and top and freewheel except on the cheapest [...] "Family" [...] model. All gears are [...] "silent". The freewheel can be locked by a control on the facia. Startix optional engine starting is now fitted.|$|R
50|$|When the Yamaha XS 650 was {{launched}} in 1968 it {{had one of the}} most advanced engines in its class of large parallel twin motorcycles. The <b>engine</b> and <b>gearbox</b> are <b>unit</b> construction with the crankcase split horizontally for ease of assembly whereas almost all contemporaries in its class in 1968 are either unit construction with a vertically split crankcase or pre-unit construction with separate <b>engine</b> and <b>gearbox.</b> The XS650's <b>engine</b> was used in AMA Professional Dirt Track Racing by national champion Kenny Roberts. In 1968 only the Laverda 750S, and the Honda CB350, also launched that year, matched the XS 650's modernity of unit construction and SOHC valve operation.|$|R
5000|$|The Brough Superior Austin Four was a limited-production {{motorcycle}} {{designed and}} manufactured by Brough Superior of Nottingham, UK in 1932. [...] It was {{listed in the}} 1932 Brough Superior catalog as the 'Straight Four' but it was {{commonly known as the}} Brough Superior Austin Four, or BS4, or '3-wheeled Brough'. The machine is unique in its design, being powered by a modified Austin 7 automobile <b>engine</b> and <b>gearbox</b> <b>unit,</b> from which a driveshaft emerges on the center-line of the motor. Rather than design a new gearbox, George Brough had the inspiration to keep the central driveshaft, and use a pair of close-couple rear wheels driven by a central final drive box. This 3-wheeled design was legally considered a motorcycle as the wheels centers were within 24". [...] The Brough Superior-Austin Four created a sensation when revealed at the 1931 Olympia Motorcycle Show.|$|R
50|$|Early models {{included}} an in-line four-cylinder side-valve 500cc <b>engine,</b> with <b>unit</b> <b>gearbox</b> and shaft drive. By the 1930s Motobecane was producing a best-selling range of motorcycles {{and during the}} immediate post-war years the company diversified into moped production, selling two wheelers under two banners: Motobecane and Mobylette. Following {{the creation of the}} MBK brand in the early eighties, scooters became the company's core business.|$|R
5000|$|The car {{was based}} on BMC Mini {{mechanical}} components with the transverse <b>engine</b> and <b>gearbox</b> <b>unit</b> mounted in a mid-engine configuration. A strong square tubular spaceframe chassis with integral roll-over protection was produced by racing car specialist Arch Motors and was bonded to a fibreglass body made by Specialised Mouldings who supplied many of the top sports, racing and F1 constructors of the day. The end product was a light yet rigid structure, with all-round independent coil spring and wishbone suspension. Combining light weight, a low centre of gravity and low aerodynamic drag from a body that measured just 40.5 in high, the Unipower GT offered very good performance and excellent road holding and handling characteristics. Available with the 998 cc Mini-Cooper or more potent 1275 cc Cooper [...] "S" [...] engine, this later version {{was reported to be}} capable of 0-60 mph in around 8 seconds and to have a maximum speed of almost 120 mi/h km/h.|$|R
5|$|The plastic fairing {{ran from}} below the {{handlebars}} {{and under the}} footpegs, protecting the rider's legs from wind and road debris, as well as hiding the engine from view. This design was like the full enclosure of a scooter, but unlike a scooter the <b>engine</b> and <b>gearbox</b> <b>unit</b> was not fixed to the rear axle. This had several benefits. It moved the engine down {{and away from the}} seat, detaching the rear swingarm motion from the drivetrain for lower unsprung weight. It also made engine cooling air flow more direct, and made it possible to fit larger wheels. Placing the engine {{in the center of the}} frame, rather than close to the rear wheel, greatly improved front-rear balance. The fuel tank was located under the hinged seat, which opened to reveal the fuel filler inlet. The 17inch wheels, in comparison to the typical 10inch wheels of a scooter, were more stable, particularly on rough roads, and psychologically made the motorcycle more familiar, having an appearance closer to a bicycle than a small-wheel scooter.|$|R
5000|$|Twelve {{months later}} The Times tried the Vortic {{a second time}} noting further minor modifications: the Marles {{steering}} box is now fixed to the car's frame instead of the engine block. The <b>engine</b> clutch and <b>gearbox</b> <b>unit</b> is now held at the front on rubber. The handbrake lever is now mounted on the gearbox casing and not the body. Hydraulic shock absorbers are now fitted at the back. Then The Times commented that their correspondent believed the one-piece screen should open a little wider to give an uninterrupted direct view in bad weather. The springing might be better with hydraulic shock absorbers all round. Driving is simple and not tiring and travel is comfortable on most occasions. Highest comfortable speed was 65 mph and added [...] "It took a little working up".|$|R
25|$|The AC Ace LM Prototype was {{a single}} piece from the year 1958 with the unusual chassis number LM5000, which John Tojeiro {{designed}} {{on behalf of the}} brothers Hurlock specifically for the AC factory at the 24 Hours of Le Mans and for further long distance racing]. The vehicle was only 737-kilogram and differed fundamentally from the standard model: it had a load-bearing, lightweight, tubular steel frame without the massive ladder structure, a new front axle with single wheel suspension, this time in the form of upper and lower triangular steering with coil spring / shock units, and a newly designed pendulum axle at the rear. The open aluminium body was much flatter, with larger overhangs at the front and rear and aerodynamically rounded with a lowered down front and high tail. It was designed by the body builder Cavendish Morton. The engine/ transmission unit, a tuned production unit, came from the Bristol Type 100D2 / S. After a test ride on the Brooklands circuit, just a few kilometres from the AC factory, the prototype, which was not yet mature, completed two assignments in 1958: in June as a factory car in the Le Mans 24-hour race and in September in the Rudac Racing Team at the RAC Tourist Trophy at the Goodwood Circuit. Due to changes in the regulations, the car was no longer able to compete in the next-class category in the FIA - Sportscar World Championship. The 'Bristol' <b>engine</b> / <b>gearbox</b> <b>unit</b> went back there, the racing car was sold without drive and later rebuilt. It still exists today as a collector's item.|$|R

50|$|Pre-unit construction, {{also called}} {{separate}} construction, is a motorcycle engine architecture where the <b>engine</b> and <b>gearbox</b> are separate components {{with their own}} oil reservoirs, linked by a driving chain within a primary chaincase. Mounting plates are usually attached to the frame allowing for chain adjustment by gearbox fore-and-aft movement and via screw adjusters and elongated mounting holes. Even though Singer offered an integrated <b>engine</b> and <b>gearbox</b> in a single casing in 1911, {{it was not until}} the 1950s that technical advances meant it was possible to reliably construct <b>engines</b> with integral <b>gearboxes</b> in one <b>unit,</b> known as unit construction. Another variant is semi-unit construction, where the gearbox is bolted directly to the engine.|$|R
