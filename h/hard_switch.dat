Performed electrical tests include steady state forward and reverse I-V curves, {{as well as}} switching transient tests performed with the diodes operating in a <b>hard</b> <b>switch</b> dc-to-dc buck converter. The same tests were performed in {{current state of the}} art silicon (Si) and gallium arsenide (GaAs) Schottky and pn junction devices for evaluation and comparison purposes. The SiC devices tested have a voltage rating of 200, 300, and 600 V.

40|$|Auxiliary power {{converters}} for traction rolling stock applications {{have to operate}} under difficult conditions, including high input voltages which are subject to wide fluctuations, high temperatures and harsh environmental constraints. Additionally {{there is often a}} need for silent operation, which implies switching frequencies above 20 kHz. Increasingly, high frequency DC-DC converters are being used for these applications, with their advantages of reduced size and weight. However, the requirement to accommodate high input voltages and switch at high frequencies is challenging for a conventional hard switched converter based on IGBTs, which makes soft switching topologies an attractive alternative. This paper presents the design strategy for a Zero Voltage Switched (ZVS) 6 kW battery charger switching at 20 kHz using IGBTs. The paper illustrates how the design is a tradeoff between managing the <b>hard</b> <b>switch</b> turn-on losses at light load, minimising the duty cycle loss caused by soft switching delays, and minimising the effects of tail current switching losses. These tradeoffs affect the selection of the ZVS capacitors, the determination of the series inductance value, the transformer turns ratio, and the selection of the IGBTs to be used. Design details, theoretical predictions and experimental results are presented in this paper for the conversion system that was developed...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, a <b>hard</b> <b>switched</b> and zero-voltage {{switching}} fullbridge converter {{for high}} power applications are compared {{in terms of}} their losses. Important issues in designing these kind of converters are to achieve high efficiency with low cost and low weight. Managing the converter parasitics and calculating the losses for the switches {{as well as for the}} high frequency transformer with square wave input are important issues in designing such a high power density converter which are discussed in this thesis. The proposed fullbridge converters are designed to convert 4 kV input voltage to 6 kV with a rated power of 2. 4 MW. The comparison is done for three different frequencies: 500 Hz, 1 kHz and 2 kHz. Also, the simulation result s and loss calculations are presented. Based on the design and analysis of both <b>hard</b> and soft <b>switching</b> schemes of the high power density DCDC full bridge converter, it has been concluded that since for the lower frequencies the efficiency is almost the same for the two topologies, <b>hard</b> <b>switched</b> is preferable due to the lower cost. However, for the higher frequencies where the total losses are dominated by the switching losses, the soft switched topology is superior. The core loss of the transformer which was exposed to the high frequency square wave excitation has been calculated by using FEMsimulation and it shows that the transformer contribution of the total loss of the converter is about 30 % at all three studied frequencies for the phase shift controlled converter. The total efficiency of the <b>hard</b> <b>switched</b> converter is 97. 3 %, 96. 3 % and 94. 5 %for 500 Hz, 1 kHz and 2 kHz switching frequencies respectively. For the zero voltage switching converter, the total efficiency changes like 97. 8 %, 97. 1 % and 96 % for 500 Hz, 1 kHz and 2 kHz respectively. As it is seen, for the low switching frequencies, the two topologies have almost the same efficiency. However, by increase in the switching frequency, the efficiency of the <b>hard</b> <b>switched</b> converter has higher reduction in comparison with the zero voltage switching converter. The less reduction of efficiency for the zero voltage switching topology is due to elimination of the switching losses in this topology...|$|R

The chargers are all off-board, and capable of active power line conditioning and bi-directional power flow to compensate local utilities during peak power loads. The active power line conditioning capability is important, since an increase of battery chargers based on ordinary diode rectifiers would increase the low order harmonic content in grid currents. The battery chargers studied are one <b>hard</b> <b>switched</b> with a voltage-stiff dc link, and three soft switched with quasi-resonant dc links.

40|$|M. Ing. Inverters are daily used in industry, {{and to a}} large extent, as {{induction}} motor drives. Power levels of inverters vary from a few watt to several megawatt. The most common part of inverters is a phase arm or a pole, consisting of two power electronic switches and two freewheeling diodes. The <b>hard</b> <b>switched</b> phase arm is the standard in industry due to simplicity and cost. Regenerative snubbing is often used at larger power levels to reduce losses in the inverter. Some aspects of the non-linear resonant pole inverter, such as regenerative snubbing and zero voltage switching, are investigated. It is obtained by utilising a non-linear resonant tank. Low current stresses permit the optimal use of the power electronic switches. The non-linear resonant pole inverter can replace the <b>hard</b> <b>switched</b> inverter, with no restriction with respect to power levels.

Researchers have proposed comparing subcomponents of fluency production, clustering (grouping semantically or phonemically related words) and switching (shifting between clusters; Abwender et al., 2001; Lanting et al., 2009; Troyer et al., 1997). The objective of the current research was to investigate measures of clustering and switching on verbal fluency tasks for healthy individuals and individuals diagnosed with dementia. Study 1 involved {{the development of a}} computer scoring program which was shown to produce more accurate and time efficient scoring. Study 2 compared clustering and switching variables across the healthy adult age span. The older age group produced fewer semantic fluency total words due to reduced <b>hard</b> <b>switching,</b> consistent with the frontal executive hypothesis of healthy aging (MacPherson et al., 2002). Study 3 compared healthy older adults to individuals diagnosed with AD. Measures of clustering and switching did not reliably differentiate AD from healthy aging, which could have resulted from the heterogeneity of the AD group. Study 4 compared clustering and switching variables longitudinally in an AD sample. When initial stage of symptom severity was controlled for, individuals at early stages of AD showed decline in phonemic total word production over time due to decline in switching ability and continued to show slight decline on semantic fluency over time, consistent with the progression of AD to prefrontal lobe regions (Levy & Chelune, 2007).

40|$|Environmental aspects have {{during the}} last years made {{electric}} vehicles an interesting competitor to the present internal combustion engine driven vehicles. For a broad introduction of pure electric vehicles, a battery charging infrastructure is deemed necessary. However, to build and maintain such an infrastructure is costly. Active power line conditioning capabilities could {{be included in the}} battery charger, making the infrastructure advantageous from the distribution network point of view. Another option is that the battery charger could be able to support the grid with peak power during periods of stability problems or emergency situations. This means that energy is borrowed from the batteries of vehicles connected to a charger. The price for energy supplied by the batteries is likely to be several times higher than the normal electric energy price, due to the wear costs of the batteries. Therefore, the battery charger losses also represents a high cost. It is often stated that resonant converters have a high efficiency compared to <b>hard</b> <b>switched.</b> Since carrier based pulse width modulation is employed, quasi resonant DC link converters are of interest.
