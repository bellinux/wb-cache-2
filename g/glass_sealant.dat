The addition of silver as a cathode conductive layer reduced the cell overpotential {{and increased the}} cell performance. However, {{the results showed that}} silver was also responsible for the cell degradation. Using silver in SOFC stacks reduces system durability. The silver thermal expansion did not match with the thermal expansion of the other cell materials, and therefore, caused damage to the <b>glass</b> <b>sealant.</b> Silver was also found unstable in the dual atmosphere. The results demonstrated that the microstructure of the silver anode lead connection wire changed after it had been exposed to the dual atmosphere, the solid silver wires and the seal became porous.

For this system of tubular cells with the anode connection at the middle of the cell, the silver seal would be exposed to the dual atmosphere. Therefore, if silver is applied as a sealant/current collector for a µSOFC, it has to be isolated to avoid exposure to the dual atmosphere. The additional sealing of the silver by glass was needed to extend the cell operation.

40|$|The wing {{leading edge}} and nose cone of the Space Shuttle are {{fabricated}} from a reinforced carbon/carbon material (RCC).

A chloridation/oxidation mechanism is proposed to arise from the NaCl deposited on the wings from the sea-salt laden air in Florida.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Glass</b> ionomer <b>sealants</b> are an {{alternative}} to resin-based sealants, especially for use in partially erupted permanent molars. The authors conducted a study to compare the retention, marginal staining and cariostatic properties of a <b>glass</b> ionomer <b>sealant</b> with those of a resin-based sealant during a 24 -month period. METHODS: We {{included in this study}} 39 patients aged 5 through 9 years who had bilateral partially erupted first permanent molars. One of us (S. B.) placed a resin-based sealant (Delton Plus FS+, Dentsply Professional, York, Pa.) (group D) on a partially erupted first molar in one quadrant of the maxilla or mandible and a <b>glass</b> ionomer <b>sealant</b> (GC Fuji Triage White, GC America, Alsip, Ill.) (group T) in the other quadrant. Two masked and calibrated investigators (S. A. A., J. C.) evaluated the sealants for retention, marginal staining and carious lesions at three, six, 12 and 24 months. The authors used a multinomial regression for statistical analysis (P 3 ̆c. 05). RESULTS: The recall rate was 69. 2 percent at 24 months. Two sealants from group D and three from group T were lost completely. Complete retention rates at 24 months were 40. 7 and 44. 4 percent for groups D and T, respectively. The authors found no statistically significant difference in retention rates between groups at each recall examination (P 3 ̆e. 05). For marginal staining, sealants in the resin-based group exhibited statistically higher marginal staining than did <b>sealants</b> in the <b>glass</b> ionomer group (P 3 ̆c. 05). Although the authors detected no caries in teeth in group T, teeth in group D in which the sealant was lost completely experienced demineralization. CONCLUSIONS: Resin-based and <b>glass</b> ionomer <b>sealants</b> exhibited similar retention rates at 24 months. However, marginal staining was lower in the glass ionomer group, and the authors found no caries in teeth in this group. Consequently, <b>glass</b> ionomer <b>sealants</b> may be a better choice when salivary contamination is expected. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Sealing during tooth eruption presents a particular challenge owing to difficulty in isolating the tooth. Glass ionomers may be a better material for sealing partially erupted molars...|$|R
40|$|Two {{sapphire}} substrates are tightly bonded {{through a}} BaTiAl 6 O 12 -glass thin film, by irradiation with a nanosecond laser. After the laser process, {{the composition of}} the <b>glass</b> <b>sealant</b> changes, due to incorporation of Al 2 O 3 from the upper substrate. After annealing of the bonded samples (950 degrees C for 30 minutes) crystalline structures are observed by TEM which are attributed to crystalline BaTiAl 6 O 12.

The structural and optical characterizations of the bonded samples clarify the laser soldering procedure as well as the origin of the luminescence.

30|$|However, {{due to the}} {{difference}} in thermal expansion coefficient of silver and glass, {{there is a risk}} of damage to the glass coating. The components that have much lower thermal expansion coefficient than silver are YSZ 10.5, Ni/YSZ 12.5, SDC 12.8 and cathode 14.6, compared to silver 18.9 [*]×[*] 10 − 6  K− 1. The glass sealant’s thermal expansion coefficient was selected to match the expansion of the cell components and was around 12 [*]×[*] 10 − 6  K− 1. With this mismatch in thermal expansion, significant internal stress is created. After the glass sintering (at 850  °C for 8  h), there was no visible damage to the glass surface. However, the long-term cell operation at elevated temperature or thermo-cycling resulted in the crack formation in the glass structure (Fig.  1 d). These studies suggest that the high silver coefficient of thermal expansion can create problems for application of silver as an anode interconnect (and sealant) for the µSOFCs even with a glass coating. For this specific application, the rapid start and cooling required by APU could favour crack formation within the <b>glass</b> <b>sealant.</b>|$|E

30|$|The risk of {{vaporisation}} and sublimation {{of silver}} {{exposed to air}} increases at higher reaction and operating temperatures. The vaporisation rate depends on temperature and atmosphere, and is higher in air than in H 2 /H 2 O atmosphere. Meulenberg et al. [2] extrapolated that up to 2 % of silver can evaporate after 40, 000  h at 690  °C in air. The evaporation will increase {{with the increase in}} the silver surface area. The cathode silver layer used in presented experiments was porous. Considering high porosity of the silver layer and its thickness 10 – 30  μm, {{a significant part of the}} silver can evaporate after the cell’s lifetime. The <b>glass</b> <b>sealant,</b> which is applied to maintain gas tightness, also poses a problem as glass sealants usually require sintering at 850  °C for several hours—leading to evaporation of silver into and through the glass matrix. In our previous report [29], the cathode was coated with silver ink to receive good current collection before glass sintering. This exposed the porous silver to the high temperature of 850  °C for 8  h. The reverse fabrication, with sintering glass before coating the cathode with silver, reduced silver degradation. However, it increases the complexity of the cell mass production. The Ag current collection film can be applied after the glass sintering for a single cell, although this process is impractical for the stack manufacture.|$|E

Experimental results in terms of crystallization behavior, thermal expansion coefficient, crystalline phase content, wetting and joining properties, microstructure, interfacial reaction mechanisms, {{as well as the}} long term stability of the thermal expansion coefficient, mineral phases, sticking, and stability against reactive evaporation were discussed. Compositions of glasses were developed by a theoretical approach termed constitutional compound calculation. Glasses from the system BaO-CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 (B-C-A-S) display high thermal expansion, higher than glasses from the system MgO-CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2. After performing a systematic investigation to the entire BaO-CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 system, the properties of suitable glass were optimized by additional oxides. Finally, a specific formula termed S 25 was found to be the optimum sealant. Long term stability tests showed good sticking, low evaporation loss, and good gas tightness.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{difference}} in preventing dentine lesion development between resin-based and <b>glass</b> ionomer <b>sealant</b> materials is unclear. Two recently published reviews {{were unable to}} conclude on the difference because the comparison was an exclusion criterion in one review and there were statistical shortcomings in the relevant papers in the other (Cochrane) review. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present investigation was {{to carry out a}} systematic review on the caries-preventive effect of these two types of sealant materials under more liberal exclusion criteria concerning the statistical presentations in the publications. METHODS: Based on five exclusion criteria, the literature search in the electronic libraries PubMed and MEDLINE and the publications retrieved in the Cochrane review, revealed 12 eligible publications for analyses. A variety of glass ionomers and resin-based sealant materials had been applied in the included studies. Attributable risk (AR) was chosen rather than relative risk (RR), as used in the Cochrane review, because RR is very instable in a low caries population. RESULTS: There was no consistent pattern observed with respect to the caries-preventive effect of either resin-based or <b>glass</b> ionomer <b>sealants.</b> Therefore, it was impossible to calculate an overall AR. CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that either resin-based or <b>glass</b> ionomer <b>sealant</b> material is superior to the other in preventing dentine lesion development in pits and fissures over time...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of a cooperation project, ceramic components of alumina, Al 2 O 3, were sealed in a gastight manner for chemical applications using a sealing compound based on ceramic raw materials. The sealing is adapted to the Al 2 O 3 ceramic with respect to expansion coefficient and wettability and it is inert, mechanically stable, chemically resistant and above all gastight at application temperatures of approx. 1000 degreesC. This was achieved with high reproducibility by a composition in the SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 - CaO-K 2 O quaternary system. The ceramic sealing compound is selectively crystallized by adequate temperature control and shows then the required high temperature resistance. The strengths achieved are sufficient for the planned application as a sealing material for a ceramic microreactor. The temperature cycling resistance and the thermal shock resistance are also adapted to Al 2 O 3. Additional tests of commercial <b>glass</b> <b>sealants</b> were carried out to evaluate the results obtained. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the final}} report of a one-year, Laboratory-Directed Research and Development (LDRD) project at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). In an effort to address the {{problems}} of long term storage and nuclear waste minimization, zircon has been proposed as a host medium for plutonium and other actinides recovered from dismantled nuclear weapons. The objective of this work is to investigate the feasibility of large scale fabrication of Pu-bearing zircon. Since PuO{sub 2 } is thermodynamically less stable than ZrO{sub 2 }, it is expected that the process parameters determined for synthesizing ZrSiO{sub 4 } (zircon) would be applicable to those for PuSiO{sub 4 } (Pu-zircon). Furthermore, since the foremost concern in plutonium processing is the potential for contamination release, this work emphasizes the development of process parameters, using zircon first, to anticipate potential material problems in the containment system for reaction mixtures during processing. Stoichiometric mixtures of ZrO{sub 2 } and SiO{sub 2 }, in hundred-gram batches, have been subjected to hot isostatic pressing (HIP) at temperatures near 1, 500 C and pressures approximately 10, 000 psi. The product materials have been analyzed by x-ray powder diffraction, and are found to consist of zircon after approximately two hours of reaction time. From this work, {{it is clear that the}} fabrication of large quantities of Pu-zircon is feasible. The most notable result of this work is evidence for the existence of container problems. This result, in turn, suggests potential solutions to these problems.

40|$|Success in {{designing}} self-healing materials has important consequences for material safety, product performance and enhanced fatigue lifetime. For example, solid oxide electrolyser and fuel cells development is hindered {{by a lack}} of long-term durability of seals caused by cracking induced by thermal expansion mismatch. In these applications, self healing glasses need to be developed to unsure a reasonable durability of the seal. It is consequently interesting to better understand and analyse the self healing behaviour of cracks in <b>glass</b> <b>sealant,</b> and more generally in oxide glasses. Although the process of crack opening has been widely studied, the driving forces controlling crack healing are not clearly identified [1, 2]. Viscous flow is obviously an important parameter but environment has also been observed to play a crucial role. And it is also evident that residual stresses cannot be ignored. In this study we analyse by micro-indentation the healing of cracks generated in different silicate and borosilicate glasses. Healing thermal treatment is performed at temperatures both above and below Tg in humid and dry environment. Basically, we analyse the shape and the length of crack as a function of treatment's time. Our results confirm that temperature and thus viscosity plays a major role. But although thermal treatments were realized at the same viscosities for the different glasses and under the same atmosphere, our results clearly evidence that the healing rate depends on the glass composition, being faster in the borosilicate glass. Our results also evidence that water vapour enhanced cracks healing both in silicate and borosilicate glasses. In the case of borosilicate glass in humid environment, almost complete healing is observed even 20 °C below Tg. For thermal treatment realized above Tg, we can observe a change {{in the shape of the}} crack, with a spheroidization. This leads us to the conclusion, that surface tension can not be neglected. In this perspective, we develop a specific device allowing us to measure surface tension. [1] B. A. Wilson, E. D. Case, J. of Materials Science 32 (1997) 3163 - 3175 [2] P. Hrma, W. T. Han, A. R.

40|$|Fuel {{cells are}} the direct energy {{conversion}} devices which convert the chemical {{energy of a}} fuel to electrical energy with much greater efficiency than conventional devices. Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) {{is one of the}} various types of available fuel cells; wherein the major components are made of inherently brittle ceramics. Planar SOFC have the advantages of high power density and design flexibility over its counterpart tubular configuration. However, structural integrity, mechanical reliability, and durability are of great concern for commercial applications of these cells. The stress distribution in a cell is a function of geometry of fuel cell, temperature distribution, external mechanical loading and a mismatch of thermo-mechanical properties of the materials in contact. The mismatch of coefficient of thermal expansion and elastic moduli of the materials in direct contact results in the evolution of thermal stresses in the positive electrode/electrolyte/negative electrode (PEN) assembly during manufacturing and operating conditions (repeated start up and shut down steps) as well. It has long been realized and demonstrated that the durability and reliability of SOFCs is not only determined by the degradation in electrochemical performance but also by the ability of its component materials to withstand the thermal stresses. In the present work, an attempt has been made to evaluate the thermal stresses as a function of thermal and mechanical properties of the component materials assuming contribution from other factors such as thermal gradient, mechanical loading and in-service loading conditions is insignificant. Materials {{used in the present study}} include the state of art anode (Ni-YSZ), electrolyte(YSZ) and cathode materials(LM and LSM) of high temperature SOFC and also the ones being suggested for intermediate temperature SOFC Ni-SCZ as an anode, GDC and SCZ as electrolyte and LSCF as the cathode. Variation of thermo-mechanical properties namely coefficient of thermal expansion, and elastic and shear moduli were studied using thermo-mechanical analyzer and resonant ultrasound spectroscope respectively in 25 - 900 ?C temperature range. A non-linear variation in elastic and shear moduli- indicative of the structural changes in the studied temperature range was observed for most of the above mentioned materials. Coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) was also found to increase non-linearly with temperature and sensitive to the phase transformations occurring in the materials. Above a certain temperature (high temperature region- above 600 ?C), a significant contribution from chemical expansion of the materials was also observed. In order to determine thermal stress distribution in the positive electrode, electrolyte, negative electrode (PEN) assembly, CTE and elastic and shear moduli of the component materials were incorporated in finite element analysis at temperature of concern. For the finite element analysis, anode supported configuration of PEN assembly (of 100 mm x 100 mm) was considered with 1 mm thick anode, 10 ?m electrolyte and 30 ?m cathode. The results have indicated that cathode and anode layer adjacent to cathode/electrolyte and electrolyte/anode interface respectively are subjected to tensile stresses at the operating temperature of HT-SOFC (900 ?C) and IT-SOFC (600 ?C). However, the magnitude of stresses is much higher in the former case (500 MPa tensile stress in cathode layer) when compared with the stress level in IT-SOFC (178 MPa tensile stress in cathode layer). These high stresses might have been resulted from the higher CTE of cathode when compared with the adjacent electrolyte. However, it is worth mentioning here that in the present work, we have not considered any contribution from the residual stresses arising from fabrication and the stress relaxation from softening of the <b>glass</b> <b>sealant...</b>|$|E
40|$|Two {{series of}} {{silicate}} glasses that contain gallium {{as the primary}} critical component have been identified and optimized for viscous sealing of solid oxide fuel cells operating from 650 to 850 Â°C. Both series of <b>glass</b> <b>sealants</b> crystallize partially upon heat treatment and yield multiphase microstructures that allow viscous flow at temperatures as low as 650 Â°C. A fully amorphous sealant was also developed by isolating, synthesizing and testing a silicate glass of the same composition as the remnant glassy phase {{in one of the}} two glass series. Of ~ 40 glasses tested for longer than 500 hours, a set of 5 glasses has been further tested for up to 1000 h in air, wet hydrogen, and against both yttria-stabilized zirconia and aluminized stainless steel. In some cases the testing times reached 2000 h. The reactivity testing has provided new insight into the effects of Y, Zr, and Al on bulk and surface crystallization in boro-gallio-silicate glasses, and demonstrated that at least 5 of the newly-developed glasses are viable viscous sealants...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} trial was to (1) compare the caries-preventive effect of <b>glass</b> ionomer <b>sealants,</b> placed {{according}} to the atraumatic restorative treatment (ART) procedure, with composite resin sealants over time and (2) investigate the caries-preventive effect after complete disappearance of sealant material. Forty-six boys and 57 girls, mean age 7. 8 years, were randomly divided into two treatment groups in a parallel-group study design. A light-polymerized composite resin sealant material and a high-viscosity glass ionomer were each placed in 180 fully erupted first molars in their respective treatment groups. Evaluation took place annually for 5 years by calibrated examiners. After 5 years, 86 % composite resin and 88 % <b>glass</b> ionomer <b>sealants</b> did not survive. Three categories of re-exposure periods for caries development in pits and fissures after complete loss of sealants were distinguished: 0 - 1, 1 - 2 and 2 - 3 years. In the 2 - to 3 -year group, 13 and 3 % of pits and fissures previously sealed with composite resin and glass ionomer, respectively, were diagnosed as having developed a dentine lesion. The relative risks (95 % CI) of dentine lesion development in surfaces sealed with glass ionomer compared to those sealed with composite resin after 3, 4 and 5 years were 0. 22 (0. 06 - 0. 82), 0. 32 (0. 14 - 0. 73) and 0. 28 (0. 13 - 0. 61), respectively. The relative risks of dentine lesion development in pits and fissures previously sealed with glass ionomer compared with composite resin over re-exposure periods of 1 - 2 and 2 - 3 years were 0. 26 (0. 14 - 0. 48) and 0. 25 (0. 09 - 0. 68), respectively. We conclude that the caries-preventive effect of high-viscosity <b>glass</b> ionomer <b>sealants,</b> placed using the ART procedure, was between 3. 1 and 4. 5 times {{higher than that of}} composite resin sealants after 3 - 5 years. Furthermore, high-viscosity (ART) <b>glass</b> ionomer <b>sealants</b> appear to have a four times higher chance of preventing caries development in re-exposed pits and fissures of occlusal surfaces in first molars than light-cured composite resin sealant material over a 1 - to 3 -year period. A well-designed clinical trial using different types of oral health personnel should be implemented to confirm these initial results...|$|R
