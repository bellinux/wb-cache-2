40|$|AbstractFriction Stir Spot Welding (FSSW) is {{gathering}} attention of automotive and aerospace sectors. It {{is an alternative}} for rivets, electric resistance welding and offers substantial advantages with regard to energy consumption, environmental protection and mechanical properties of weld. At present, research efforts are being made {{to gain a better}} understanding of the process, to explore different tool configurations, to optimize the set of process parameters and to widen the applicability of FSSW. In this regard, having reliable finite element model that is capable of simulating FSSW with minimal possible simulation time can turn out handy to reduce the number of physical experiments required in such studies and applications. The current work investigates the plunge and <b>dwell</b> <b>phase</b> of Friction Stir Welding (FSW) using three-dimensional (3 -D) finite element (FE) modelling. A 3 -D FE model is developed in the commercial code ABAQUS/Explicit using the Coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian Formulation, the Johnson-Cook material law, and Coulomb's Law of friction. A successful weld depends on proper material flow and temperature existing during the process. This is dictated by selected processing parameters. If the appropriate conditions are not present, cold or hot defects occur, leading to a faulty weld. Since FSSW comprises of plunge and <b>dwell</b> <b>phase,</b> the simulation results are explained in the context of modeling of FSSW. The simulation results include effect of process parameters (tool rotation speed, plunge velocity, plunge depth) and tool geometry (pin profile) on estimating temperature and morphology of weld region. Tools with square and triangular pin profile aided in increasing the process temperature and widening the weld nugget with less power consumption compared to their counterpart. Simulation time reduced to a greater extent in CEL when compared to Lagrangian, Eulerian and ALE...|$|E

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{cumulative damage}} and its evolution {{during the cold}} dwell fatigue of a near-alpha titanium alloy. An experimental study was undertaken to examine the evolution of life, strain, strength and damage of 13 titanium IMI 834 samples cut from a single disk forging. The samples were tested in the same dwell-fatigue loading conditions. In the <b>dwell</b> <b>phase,</b> the load is maintained at 80 % of ultimate tensile strength (824 MPa, 90 % of yield strength) for thirty seconds. The secant Young's modulus and inelastic strain at minimum load were measured in order to document {{the evolution of the}} irreversible damage against the number of cycles for all specimens. Experimental observations show significant differences in dwell-fatigue life and damage behavior. This mechanical analysis and an analysis of the cumulative Weibull reliability distribution suggest a bimodal dwell-fatigue failure process. Some features of the mechanical behavior can be used to sort the samples according to each of the two failure modes and improve the reliability of the fatigue test campaign.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{evaluate}} the efficiency of removing organic pollutants from wastewater in a household wastewater treatment plant with a hybrid reactor. The efficiency of the plant was analysed in terms of decreasing BOD 5, COD and the content of total suspended solids in differentiated technological conditions. The variable parameter was the length of the reactor aeration phase and the <b>dwell</b> <b>phase.</b> Six different aeration variants were analysed. The efficiency of a wastewater treatment plant with a hybrid reactor in terms of reducing BOD 5 oscillated from 81 to 90 %, COD – 64 – 84 %, whereas total suspended solids – 66 – 89 % which, as a rule, was not sufficient to achieve standard levels. The best results were achieved for the following variants: 2 h aeration – 2 h dwell and 1 h aeration – 0. 5 h dwell. Lower efficiency of the plant could have been attributed to operational problems, mainly failures of the plant control system and uneven conditions such as air temperature, volume and composition of wastewater received in the plant...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPower devices {{nowadays}} possess low switching and conduction loss characteristics {{owing to}} the improvement in semiconductor device manufacturing. Insulated gate bipolar transistors are widely utilized in power modules because of such characteristics. When a power module is subjected to cyclic temperature load, the thermal stress resulting from the mismatch among the coefficients of thermal expansion of materials causes fatigue to the interface of the materials. Different operating requirements cause the module to have different temperature profiles. Different dwell times and ramp rates produce different stress relaxation, which eventually affect {{the reliability of the}} power module. A 2 D finite element model has been established based on an actual sample. The model was subjected to thermal cycling between - 40 ̊C and 125 ̊C to determine the effect of dwell time and ramp rate on the creep behavior of the solder. The results indicate that dwell time produces accumulative creep strain because of stress relaxation. Furthermore, dwell time at a high temperature leads to evident stress relaxation. Ramp section produces more accumulative creep strain than <b>dwell</b> <b>phase</b> in one thermal cycle. Decreasing the ramp rate increases creep strain and diminishes reliability...|$|E

Rapid curing of thermoplastic-toughened epoxy matrix composites results in different mechanical properties. To investigate the structure&# 8211;property relationship, we investigated a poly(ether sulfone) -modified triglycidylaminophenol/ 4, 4 '-diamino diphenyl sulfone system that was cured at different heating rates. An intermediate dwell was also applied during the rapid heating of the thermoplasticmodified epoxy system. We found that a higher heating rate led to a larger domain size of the phase-separated macrostructure and also facilitated more complete phase separation. The intermediate <b>dwell</b> helped <b>phase</b> separation to proceed even further, leading to an even larger domain size of the macrostructure.

The ceramic tile was either bare or had a cover plate attached to the front. The cover plate thickness has been varied and gives best results for a thickness of about half the projectile diameter used in the experiments.

40|$|Using {{recently}} {{collected data}} which {{was measured with}} state-of-the-art techniques, models for nucleation site density, bubble departure diameter, and nucleation frequency were compared against the acquired data. The particular focus of this work is on the ebullition cycle and associated bubble nucleation frequency, looking at the models proposed by M. Z. Podowski. In my analysis, I took the average values for the growth and dwell times directly from the data, {{rather than from the}} models for those parameters. The results of those investigations showed that the basic principles approach for considering the parameters of the ebullition cycle held up pretty well with the experimental data, with Ti(t), the temperature curve during the ebullition cycle, corresponding remarkably well with the data curves. However, one parameter which was always overvalued was T(0 *) - the predicted temperature of the start of the <b>dwell</b> <b>phase.</b> It was generally 1 - 2 degrees Celsius higher than the experimental value. For a fully rigorous analysis of the ebullition models in future works, it is recommended that all parameters be predicted rather than pulled from the data, particularly of the growth and dwell times. by Matthew Miguel Virgen.

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} is presented that bacteriophage DNA packaging motors have a cycle comprised of bind/release thermal ratcheting with release-associated DNA pushing via ATP-dependent protein folding. The proposed protein folding occurs in crystallographically observed peptide segments that project into an axial channel of a protein 12 -mer (connector) that serves, {{together with a}} coaxial ATPase multimer, as the entry portal. The proposed cycle begins when reverse thermal motion causes the connector’s peptide segments to signal the ATPase multimer to bind both ATP and the DNA molecule, thereby producing a <b>dwell</b> <b>phase</b> recently demonstrated by single-molecule procedures. The connector-associated peptide segments activate by transfer of energy from ATP during the dwell. The proposed function of connector/ATPase symmetry mismatches is to reduce thermal noise-induced signaling errors. After a dwell, ATP is cleaved and the DNA molecule released. The activated peptide segments push the released DNA molecule, thereby producing a burst phase recently shown to consist of four mini-bursts. The constraint of four mini-bursts is met by proposing that each mini-burst occurs via pushing by three of the 12 subunits of the connector. If all four mini-bursts occur, the cycle repeats. If the mini-bursts are not completed, a second cycle is superimposed on the first cycle. The existence of the second cycle is based on data recently obtained with bacteriophage T 3. When both cycles stall, energy is diverted to expose the DNA molecule to maturation cleavage...|$|E

To keep track of targets, a radar system must meet its timing and energy constraints. We propose a new task model for radar dwells to accurately characterize their timing parameters. We develop an algorithm of transforming every dwell task as a semi-period task so the dwell task can meet its timing constraint and the interarrival times of the task may not a constant. We also develop an enhanced templatebased scheduling algorithm to schedule such tasks to meet the timing and energy constraints. Simulation results show that this algorithm can significantly improve the resource utilization. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} scheduling radar <b>dwells</b> in multi-function <b>phased</b> array radar systems. The timing constraint of radar tasks are usually modeled by the minimal and maximal temporal distance between any two consecutive dwells of a task. Such a timing constraint {{makes it difficult for}} traditional real-time scheduling techniques to provide predicatable timing guarantee, without over-consuming the resources. We propose a novel approach to model the dwells as periodic real-time tasks. The periods of the tasks are synthesized by the minimal and maximal temporal distance constraint of the dwells. The synthetic periods allow the template-based scheduling algorithm to compute efficient dwell schedules with low overhead. We evaluate the algorithms via extensive simulations. Simulation results show that this algorithm can significantly improve the resource utilization, comparing with traditional dwell scheduling algorithms. ...|$|R

An attempt to understand it led to the next natural question of how long does a particle need to tunnel a barrier.

A short review of the evolution of these time concepts, followed by an account of experiments involving field-induced tunnel ionization and electron tunneling in a solid state junction is presented here. Whereas the former experiments use sophisticated techniques involving femtosecond laser pulses and determine the tunneling time by mapping the angle of rotation of the field vector to time, like the hands of a watch, the latter provides a simpler method through the measurement of current-voltage characteristics of the junction.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{locate the}} source of {{slowness}} in typing movements in subjects with spastic hemiparesis and to examine whether enlargement of keys would facilitate typing. DESIGN: Experimental within-subjects design. SETTING: Werkenrode, a special school for physically disabled young children. SUBJECTS: Eleven subjects (mean age 17. 1 years) diagnosed as having spastic hemiparesis, most {{as a result of}} cerebral palsy. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects made fast reciprocal tapping movements with one finger of both hands separately within a 10 -second interval. Keys of 12 x 12 mm and 24 x 24 mm were used. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Interkey response interval (IRI), dwell time (interval during which the key is pressed) and forces were measured. Also, the standard deviation and coefficient of variation of the variables were calculated to determine regularity of the movements. RESULTS: The impaired hand tapped slower and more irregularly and exerted less force. In addition, the duration of the <b>dwell</b> <b>phase</b> was lengthened for this hand. However, the percentage dwell time as a function of IRI was not different between hands. Enlargement of the keys shortened flight time (i. e. time in which the finger moves through the air from one key to the next) of the impaired hand, but not dwell time. CONCLUSIONS: The entire movement is slower for the impaired hand. Disturbances are not exclusively located at the inversion of the movement. With respect to keyboard design, enlarged keys and a locked repeat function of the keys may be beneficial for subjects suffering from spasticity. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSensorimotor {{synchronization}} is {{a fundamental}} skill involved {{in the performance of}} many individual and ensemble artistic tasks (e. g., music, dance). Separate theories may explain how time intervals are estimated, and how bodily displacements toward spatial goals are controlled. However, {{the manner in which the}} nervous system produces movements toward concomitant temporal and spatial goals remains poorly understood. Previous studies have shown that typical rhythmic movements involve a motion and motionless phase (dwell). The <b>dwell</b> <b>phase</b> represents a sizeable fraction of the rhythm period, and scales with this period. The rationale for this specific organization remains unexplained, and is the object of this study. Two groups of participants (drummers, non-drummers) performed tapping movements paced at 0. 5 - 2. 5 Hz. The participants consistently organized their behavior between acoustic cues into dwell and movement phases, and movement kinematics varied with the period of the rhythm, yielding velocity profiles becoming increasingly asymmetric as the period expanded. The main new results were that the temporal variability of both the dwell and movement phases were consistent with Weber's law, and the longest phase exhibited always the smallest variability. We developed an optimal statistical model that formalized the distribution of time into dwell and movement intervals as a function of their temporal variability. The model accurately predicted the participants' dwell and movement durations irrespective of musical skill, strongly suggesting that the distribution of dwell and movement intervals results from an optimization process, dependent on each participant's skill to predict time during rest and movement...|$|E
40|$|Effects of pH-neutral, bicarbonate-buffered {{dialysis}} fluid on peritoneal transport kinetics in children. BackgroundDue {{to their}} superior biocompatibility, pH-neutral solutions {{are beginning to}} replace acidic lactate-buffered peritoneal dialysis (PD) fluids. We hypothesized that pH-neutral and acidic solutions might differentially affect peritoneal transport in the early <b>dwell</b> <b>phase,</b> {{due to differences in}} ionic shifts and initial peritoneal vasodilation. Such differences may become clinically relevant in patients with frequent short cycles on automated PD (APD). MethodsTwenty-five children were treated with a lactate-buffered (35 mmol/L, pH 5. 5) or a bicarbonate-buffered PD solution (34 mmol/L, pH 7. 4) in randomized order on two sequential days. Each day a four-hour Standardized Permeability Analysis (SPA) was performed, followed by overnight APD (7 cycles, fill volume 1000 mL/m 2, dwell time 75 min). Functional peritoneal surface area was dynamically assessed using the three-pore model. ResultsWhile intraperitoneal pH was constant at 7. 41 ± 0. 03 throughout the SPA with bicarbonate fluid, the dialysate remained acidic for more than one hour with lactate solution (pH 7. 12 ± 0. 08 at 1 h). Total pore area was 60 % higher during the first 30 minutes of the dwell than under steady-state conditions, without a difference between acidic and pH-neutral fluid. Net base gain, intraperitoneal volume kinetics, glucose absorption, ultrafiltration rate, effective lymphatic absorption and the transport of urea, potassium, β 2 -microglobulin and albumin were similar with both fluids. However, phosphate and creatinine elimination were 10 % lower with bicarbonate PD fluid, resulting in corresponding significant decreases in the 24 -hour clearances of these solutes. ConclusionThe peritoneal surface area is not measurably influenced by pH-neutral PD fluid. Creatinine and phosphate elimination appears to be slightly reduced with bicarbonate fluid; this observation awaits clarification in extended therapeutical trials...|$|E
40|$|A process {{analysis}} {{is carried out}} systematically to quantify how the melt temperature at the nozzle exit {{is affected by the}} operating conditions during the plastication, <b>dwell</b> and injection <b>phases</b> in a thermoplastics injection molding process.

The three consecutive <b>phases,</b> plastication, <b>dwell,</b> and injection are studied and modeled separately. A set of artificial neural networks (ANNs) has been developed to predict the effect of the operating conditions on the melt temperature during plastication. One dimensional heat conduction model is used to simulate the dwell period. A free boundary model for the injection phase is developed to simulate the melt flow pushed by the forward movement of the screw, and the finite element method (FEM) is used to solve this model.

40|$|In the past, {{the quantum}} {{mechanical}} tunneling time through simple rectangular barrier has been obtained by various theoretical approaches including the <b>dwell</b> time, the <b>phase</b> delay time, the Larmor clock time and also using {{the numerical analysis}} of wave packets. The agreement among these approaches over a range of incident electron energy is far from satisfactory. In this manuscript, analytical expressions for the tunneling time are derived based on the group velocity approach (referred hereafter as the average particle time, τAPT) for single and double rectangular potential barriers under zero bias. The results of the single barrier case, including the limiting value of the tunneling time for various energy limits, are compared with these previous tunneling time calculations. The τAPT results provide physically meaningful tunneling times for zero and infinite incident energy limits of the electron. The τAPT for the double barrier structure is computed from the analytical solution {{as a function of}} the incident energy of the electron for two experimentally studied resonant tunneling structures.

40|$|The study {{addresses}} (1) {{the impact}} (i) of ceramic microstructures and (ii) of the deformation of the ceramic/backing composite on ceramic fragmentation and resulting projectile erosion, and (2) other materials influences which {{may affect the}} abrasive destruction of the penetrator via the mechanical properties of the ceramics (Young's modulus E, hardness, HEL, bending/compressive strength, KIc). Regarding the highly dynamic interaction, the study {{had to find out}} whether all mechanical parameters must be dynamically recorded for understanding the ballistic performance. The results show that the ballistic strength of Al 2 O 3 and spinel ceramics and single crystals with different backings (steel, aluminum, glass) is subject to a 3 -fold hierarchy of influences: 1. Top priority is the cera mic fragmentation governed by the microstructure and by the dynamic stiffness (not simply by the Young's modulus E) of the ceramic/backing target. These influences also affect the relative importance of <b>dwell</b> and penetration <b>phases.</b> 2. On a middle rank, E and the dynamic stiffness of the ceramic are responsible for the projectile deformation during dwell. 3. On penetration, the abrasive benefit of a high ceramic hardness depends {{on the size of the}} ceramic debris, i. e. on ceramic fragmentation; this effect increases the projectile erosion by ceramics with glass backing compared with Al backing. In contrast, all strength data are weakly correlated with the ballistic figure. This hierarchy explains apparently contradictive findings of the past...|$|R
40|$|In the {{laboratory}} stage thixocasting of steels {{has shown a}} great potential as a modern method for making thin-walled and complex parts. Surface defects, incomplete form filling and strong inhomogeneous component characteristics were common manufacturing defects for the components manufactured in the semi-solid state. The present work was configured to improve component quality, to test low-carbon steels tested to their suitability for thixocasting and to carry out calculations and attempts to apply the process to a real component made of steel. In addition to the average temperature, the distribution of temperature in the inductively heated bolt material largely determines {{the accuracy of the}} components. A sufficiently homogeneous temperature distribution could be achieved by an cartridge concept in additition to adapted energy-time programs for the inductive heating system. The fire-resistant lining of the cartridge made from vacuum-fiber material is highly insulating and ensures a virtually airtight that effectively suppressed scaling. The data required for the heating programs of induction heating for the steel alloys 100 Cr 6, 42 CrMo 4 and X 46 Cr 13 have been prepared {{solely on the basis of}} thermo-chemical DTA experiments and calculations. Even with steel alloy X 46 Cr 13 the biggest measurable temperature difference between front and interior was always less than 10 Kelvin. The suitability of the steel alloys X 210 CrW 12, 100 Cr 6 and 42 CrMo 4 was tested in terms of thixocasting a thin walled part. These alloys showed a decreasing flow- and mold filling behavior toward low carbon contents with its origin in the different solidification morphology. The results obtained in the meandering part were reduced by half for 42 CrMo 4 compared to X 210 CrW 12. The parts made from steel 42 CrMoV 4 showed a very clear segregation tendency. The microstructure was highly dependent on wall thickness and could not be homogenized by annealing treatments. For thixoforming of steel a number of solid metals, ceramic coatings and massive ceramics are in question as tool material. Temperature measurements of tool inserts made of different materials and coatings were carried out using infrared thermography. A comparison with the results of simulations showed a viable heat transfer coefficient of about 3000 W/(m 2 K 1). Despite very long cycle times only tools made from Si 3 N 4 ceramic and the hardened copper-base alloy CuCo 1 NiBe (2. 1293) convinced. In order to confirm the transferability of the data to the process window and to validate the collected experiences a knife of the German company BÖKER BAUMWERK was redesigned after the thixocasting requirements works. It is a 265 mm long diving knife of 6 mm thickness with an as cast thickness of 0. 8 mm at the blades. Using the simulation software MAGMAsoft® two variants were developed and manufactured for different tool materials. A casting tool from hot-work steel was designed with a bulky ingate section at the handle to reduce premature solidification. The experiments showed, however, that a comparatively high piston speed of more than 0. 5 m/s is necessary for a complete filling of the thin walled knife parts at a liquid phase concentrations of fl= 55 %. The metallographic analysis showed parts of the knife according to a clear enrichment with liquid phase of the outer regions and the blade tip. A reduction of this macroscopic segregation could not be achieved by the choice of process parameters. Preliminary tests with a ceramic tool heated to temperatures of more than 1000 °C had confirmed that the thermal shock to the tools in contact with the semisolid steel is so low that - even with the oxide-ceramic tool material Al 2 O 3 - no failure occurred. The second casting tool for the diving knife was designed as an actively heated oxide ceramic tool. The numerical simulation showed a laminar filling of the mold in 1420 milliseconds because of a very slow piston velocity vp= 0. 05 m/s and because of the low thermal conductivity of the ceramic. Accordingly in the microscopic analysis, the component actually showed only little difference in globulitic structure between the tip and the handle as well as between core and surface, which was also confirmed by EDS line scans. As the only significant structural defect shrinkage porosity was found at the calculated hotspots because of the lack of a <b>dwell</b> pressure <b>phase.</b> The components had virtually no surface flaws and showed in the reproduction of the tools milling structure the ability to generate functional surfaces with typical sizes of the structure of > 30 microns with high accuracy.
