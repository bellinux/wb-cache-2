30|$|Early VSC based HVDC (referred to as HVDC Flexible in this paper) adopts {{two-level}} or three-level converter technology, but {{it always}} has several defects, such as high harmonic contents and high switching losses, etc. With the continuous growing demand for high voltage level and power transmission capacity, these defects are represented more and more obviously, which become a bottleneck for application of the two-level or three-level technology. Therefore, {{the future of the}} two-level or three-level technology may be only used for low power transmission or on some special occasions such as offshore platform power supply or variable speed drives, etc. In 2001, R.

The standard error of the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the rotating receiver (Rover) was found to range for the RTK technique between 6 - 25 mm and 9 - 43 mm, for the whole range of the movement during experiments (period 3 - 19 sec, radius 20 - 50 cm).

The underlying key physics is that the double-resonance nanoparticle enables greatly enhanced trapping and harvesting of incident FW energy, efficient internal transfer of optical energy from FW to SHW, and much improved power to transport the SHG energy from the nanoparticle to the far-field region.

It suggests that the methods of “options analysis” [...] that have revolutionized thinking about investments [...] can provide a conceptual basis for defining optimal configurations. When these procedures are applied to design issues, they are generally known as "real options analysis". The fundamental result of "real options analysis" is the determination of the value of flexibility.

40|$|This paper {{suggests}} {{an extension of}} the traditional natural monopoly (cost-subadditivity) test as it has been implemented in telecommunications. We explore two dimensions of generalization that we believe are important when evaluating the relative performance of monopoly versus duopoly. First, by using a <b>flexible</b> <b>engineering</b> process model of the local exchange network, we are able to generate market structure-specific cost data which are used to estimate various duopolistic firm cost functions. Second, we combine these cost functions, which correspond to specific entry strategies, with appropriate models of firm behavior to calculate market equilibria. This allows us to perform, in addition to a standard strictly cost-based natural monopoly test, a comparison of monopoly and duopoly on the basis of aggregate social welfare achieved under those alternative market structures. Our application of the methodology to a stylized local exchange market directs attention to a possible conflict between these alternative testing criteria and highlights the crucial impact of the nature of competitive entry on the (social welfare) performance of deregulated markets...|$|E

40|$|The {{possibility}} to monitor oscillations and quasi-static deformations of large <b>flexible</b> <b>engineering</b> structures using simple GPS kinematic techniques was investigated {{on the basis}} of a large number of experiments. Harmonic movements were simulated by a 1 Hz, dual frequency rover receiver rotating on an electro-motorized device on a fixed horizontal plane with a constant angular velocity and radius, while a base receiver was operating at a distance of few tens of meters. A large number of experiments based on different combinations of the period (T = 3 - 19 sec) and the radius of rotation (20 - 50 cm) were made; in all these experiments the parameters of the movement of the rover were independently determined, and this permitted unambiguous estimations of the accuracy of the GPS recordings. Analysis of data revealed that short period outliers were < 1. 5 %, and that the accuracy of horizontal and vertical coordinates was of the order of 2 - 12 mm and 8 - 34 mm, respectively.

40|$|Spectrally {{engineered}} semiconductor Fabry-Perot laser resonators {{are designed}} to enhance the optical feedback for selected longitudinal modes, which thereby require less gain for lasing. This is achieved by introducing refractive index perturbations {{along the length of}} the resonator. However, the physical realization of these resonators is a challenge because of very narrow tolerances; in particular the need for precise positioning of the end facets of the resonator in relation to the perturbations, and the excess propagation loss associated with the perturbations, has been a major concern. We report on a method to achieve high-quality end facet mirrors enabling precise positioning relative to the perturbations, the latter which are realized as lateral corrugations of the waveguide. Measurements show that the mirror quality is comparable to that of cleaved mirrors and that the additional loss introduced by the perturbations adds < 10 cm- 1 to the overall propagation loss, provided that the perturbations are densely enough spaced along the resonator.
