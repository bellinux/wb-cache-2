This currency was sometimes alleged to have been printed with stolen engraving plates. Victims, usually living outside major cities, would be enticed {{to travel to the}} location of the <b>green</b> <b>goods</b> men to complete the transaction. Victims were guided by a [...] "steerer" [...] to be shown large amounts of genuine currency - represented to be counterfeit - which was then placed in a bag or satchel. Victims then received offers to purchase the money at a price much less than face value. While a victim negotiated a price or was otherwise distracted, another accomplice (the [...] "ringer") would switch the bag of money for a bag containing sawdust, green paper, or other worthless items. Victims would leave unaware of the switch, and were unwilling to report the crime, as attempting to purchase counterfeit currency was itself a crime and the victim accordingly risked arrest.|$|E

5000|$|In 2010 <b>Green</b> <b>Goods</b> and Services {{survey found}} there are 3.1 million <b>Green</b> <b>Goods</b> and Services (GGS) {{jobs in the}} United States which {{accounts}} for 2.4 percent of all United States salary and wage employment. The private sector had 2.3 million GGS jobs, and the public sector had 860,000 GGS jobs. From 2010 the data indicates that green jobs are continuing to grow rapidly in the United States. The US is currently undergoing an energy revolution from coal fire power plants to renewable energy. The majority of these additions are coming from three main resources: solar (9.5 GW), natural gas (8 GW), and wind (6.8 GW). Together, these three sources make up 93 percent of total additions. [...] The shift from fossil fuels to renewables will be mirrored by US employment as workers turn away from jobs like coal mining and towards green jobs.
