[...] From Masulipatam, it was reported, that there had been numerous deaths from starvation in all quarters of the neighbouring country, and the greatest difficulty was felt in supplying the inhabitants of the town with food, though the consumption had been at one time restricted to 1/4 seer, or half a pound, per head, per diem. [...] The price of rice in the town, had been at one time four Madras measures per rupee (or 2d. per lb.)

[...] They also requested the Bengal Government to encourage the export of grain to the northern districts of Madras, and they imported considerably from the same quarter on government account. [...] In addition to these measures of relief, the Government found it necessary at the latter part of 1791, to prohibit the export of rice from Tanjore, until June 1792, except to the distressed districts, to permit 50 bags (about 7,500 lbs.) of rice, per mensem, to be distributed in charity, from the Government stores, at Vizagapatam, and to authorize the Collector of Ganjam to feed the poorest classes upon rice and natcheny porridge, at a cost of Rs. 200 to Rs. 300, per mensem. The pressure became at last so severe in this district, that Mr. Snodgrass, the Resident at Ganjam, collected local subscriptions for the relief of the poor, and employed 2,000 of them on public works, paying them their wages in grain from the Government stores.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we use the}} Global Gas Model {{to analyze}} the {{perspectives}} and infrastructure needs of the European natural gas market until 2050. Three pathways of natural gas consumption in a future low-carbon energy system in Europe are envisaged: i) a decreasing natural gas consumption, along {{the results of the}} PRIMES model for the EMF decarbonization scenarios; ii) a moderate increase of natural gas consumption, {{along the lines of the}} IEA (2012) World Energy Outlook's New Policy Scenario; and iii) a temporary increase of natural gas use as a bridge technology, followed by a strong decrease after 2030. Our results show that import infrastructure and intra-European transit capacity currently in place or under construction are largely sufficient to accommodate the import needs of the EMF decarbonization scenarios, despite the reduction of domestic production and the increase of import dependency. However, due to strong demand in Asia which draws LNG and imports from Russia, Europe has to increasingly rely on pipeline exports from Africa and the Caspian region from where new pipelines are built. Moreover, pipeline investments open up new <b>import</b> <b>and</b> <b>transit</b> paths, including reverse flow capacity, which improves the diversification of supplies. In the high gas consumption scenario similar pipeline links are realized-though on a larger scale, doubling the costs of infrastructure expansion. In the bridge technology scenario, the utilization rates of (idle) LNG import capacity can be increased for the short period of temporary strong natural gas demand...|$|E

It connects power generating stations, regional power networks of Ukraine, which are interlinked by electric power transmission lines with the voltage 220 – 250 kW. In order to investigate the influence of the power-engineering market on the main macroeconomic indices of Ukraine, a regressive analysis was made. The original data for the research were indices from such sites as International Finance Statistic (macroeconomic data) and electric power production data in Ukraine. The logarithm was taken for all the regression figures (from 1995 till 2009). On {{the basis of}} the data presented it is possible to conclude that high power consumption of Ukrainian GDP is the consequence of considerable technological lag in most branches of the economy from the level of developed countries, unsatisfactory industry structure of the national economy, negative impact of the "black economy", particularly export-import operations. Therefore, it limits the competitiveness of national output and lays a heavy burden on the economy, especially under conditions of its foreign energy dependence.

30|$|With {{regard to}} the trade {{openness}} indicators, the results are less conclusive. Nominal and real trade openness are not significantly related to productivity at the 5 % significance level. If we look at exports <b>and</b> <b>imports</b> without gold <b>and</b> <b>transit</b> trade, we find a significant positive long-run relation to productivity. However, {{the significance of the}} adjustment coefficients indicate that exports respectively imports adjust after a deviation from the long-run relationship. In this system, productivity is weakly exogenous. In addition to these openness indicators, we test the relationship between the real effective exchange rate and labor productivity and find a significant positive long-run relation. Therefore, a higher real exchange rate is accompanied with higher productivity. At first sight, a positive relation is not in line with theoretical considerations because an overvalued currency should dampen exports and therefore economic growth. However, Rodrik (2008) finds empirical evidence that this reasoning is only true for developing countries. He finds no negative relation for advanced economies. Moreover, the adjustment coefficients indicate that the real effective exchange rate adjusts after a deviation from the long-run relationship, productivity does not. Hence, an appreciation of the real effective exchange rate may be attributed to an increase in labor productivity.|$|R
