Graphite-epoxy composites were exposed to thermal cycling. Adhesive foam tapes were subjected to a vacuum environment. Metal-matrix composites were tested for baseline data. Predictive modeling designed to include strength and aging effects on composites, polymeric films, and metals under such space conditions (including the atomic oxygen environment) is discussed.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} a {{finite element model}} of a {{household}} washing machine cylinder is built and analysed in ABAQUS 6. 9 - 2. The aim is to help Asko appliances in conducting similar analysis for future manufacturing of high capacity cylinders by reducing experimentation. The analysis is mainly concerned with an evenly distributed load at a constant angular velocity. The load is applied {{with the help of}} lead plates instead of clothes. The cylinder is loaded with three thin (2 mm) lead plates weighing 2 kg each. The plates with dimensional 370 x 240 x 2 mm are mounted with one strip of double sided <b>foam</b> <b>tape</b> inside the cylinder. To estimate the behavior of the cylinder the strains are measured when the cylinder is rotating at 1620 and 2200 revolution per minute (rpm). To validate the model the numerical analyses are compared with experimental results. The results clearly show that the numerical strain values fit with experimental strain values...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{variety of}} skin {{simulators}} {{are available on}} which to practice procedures; however, choice of a suboptimal substitute compromises realism and productive practice. Objective: Skin simulators for basic dermatological procedures are reviewed. Methods: The authors’ anecdotal experience with various skin simulators for different procedures is shared. Results: The following simulators are suggested:  an unripe banana for elliptical excision, pork belly for undermining, pork belly for simple interrupted and buried suture, capped needle on a human shoulder for intramuscular injection, ripe tomato or hotdog with skin for intradermal injection, eggplant for shave biopsy, pork belly for punch biopsy, plastic tape over a dark surface for cryosurgery, and beef liver for electrosurgery.   Flaps are best practiced with foam sandwiched between <b>foam</b> <b>tape</b> or artificial anatomical models created specifically for this purpose. Limitations: The utility of one simulator over another was not compared in a controlled study. Conclusion: Efficient, realistic skin simulators are readily available for practice, which should enhance {{the safety of the}} practitioner and improve outcomes of novices...|$|E

Basic performance data such as tack, static shear, and peel properties may be helpful in selecting appropriate adhesives for non-structural applications, but these properties may not be sufficient to allow engineers to design load bearing joints. This presentation will highlight an approach to obtain meaningful engineering design data for a family of acrylic <b>foam</b> <b>tapes</b> that have found significant practical applications.

40|$|Abstract: The Semi Interlocking Masonry (SIM) {{building}} sySlem {{is being}} developed in the Centre for Infrastructure Performance and Reliability at The University of Newcastle, Australia. In seismic areas SIM {{can be used in}} the form of mor 1 ar-less engineered pallets, which have significant energy dissipation capacity due to the sliding friction between bricks induced during an earthquake. Mortar-less joints of SIM could be dry or could have some non-adhesive grip filler for improving SIM' 5 water penetration and thermal insulation. This paper focuses on the experimental investigation of frictional capacities of three different brick surfaces (dry surface, surface with linseed oil based putty, and surface with rubber <b>foam</b> <b>tape)</b> at realistic boundary conditions and loading regime. To do so, a modified couplet shear test was used. The constant pre-compression typically found in a masonry panel was applied by means of the static gravity loading. It is intended to simulate sliding between bricks due to earthquakes over service life, 160 sliding cycles or ± 1. 0 mm relative displacement were applied dynamically. The load-displacement history was recorded. The paper reports the results of this testing program in terms of the friction coefficient and the energy dissipa 1 ion evolution for each type of joint...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFor {{adhesive}} tapes, {{the strain}} before fracture often exceeds 500 %. Although the maximum stresses are quite modest the high strains to fracture result in impressive fracture energy. Due to hydrostatic stress the fracture process often starts by nucleation of microscopic cracks inside the layer. The final crack path is usually {{close to one}} of the adherends. Repeated experiments are performed both with DCB-specimens and butt-joints. The used adhesive tape is an acrylic <b>foam</b> <b>tape</b> with a thickness of 1. 1 mm and a width of 19 mm. The geometry of the specimen is adapted to the properties of the soft layer. For the DCB-specimen this implies that the length of the specimen is about 1 m. The evaluated cohesive laws from the DCB- specimens give a fracture energy of 2 kN/m and a maximum stress about 0. 5 MPa. For the butt-joints, the evaluated cohesive law corresponds well to the results from the DCB-experiments. However, the strain to fracture is slightly smaller. The stress in these specimens is distributed over a larger area and a nucleated crack rapidly crosses the load bearing area and fails the joint prematurely. For both kinds of experiments the evaluated cohesive laws show a small linear part. After this part there is an almost linear strain-hardening phase until fracture...|$|E

40|$|Engineering robust {{adhesion}} of the junction-box (j-box) is a hurdle typically {{encountered by}} photovoltaic (PV) module manufacturers during product development. There are historical incidences of adverse effects (e. g., fires) caused when the j-box/adhesive/module system has {{failed in the}} field. The addition of a weight to the j-box during the 'damp heat' IEC qualification test is proposed to verify the basic robustness of its adhesion system. The details of the proposed test will be described, {{in addition to the}} preliminary results obtained using representative materials and components. The described discovery experiments examine moisture-cured silicone, <b>foam</b> <b>tape,</b> and hot-melt adhesives used in conjunction with PET or glass module 'substrates. ' To be able to interpret the results, a set of material-level characterizations was performed, including thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and dynamic mechanical analysis. PV j-boxes were adhered to a substrate, loaded with a prescribed weight, and then placed inside an environmental chamber (at 85 C, 85 % relative humidity). Some systems did not remain attached through the discovery experiments. Observed failure modes include delamination (at the j-box/adhesive or adhesive/substrate interface) and phase change/creep. The results are discussed {{in the context of the}} application requirements, in addition to the plan for the formal experiment supporting the proposed modification to the qualification test...|$|E
40|$|This report aims to {{increase}} the scientific knowledge about long-term prospects for the adhesive and adhesive joints for bonding of stainless steels. The effects of water, temperature and chemicals on the adhesive and adhesive joints are investigated. Stainless steel plates are pretreated with a primer and isopropanol, there after joined together with single lap modeling. The strength of the joint is tested with a tensile test and additionally a watertightness test is performed {{to determine if the}} joints are watertight. For this project three versions of stainless steels is used and two different technologies of two- part adhesives, silicone and silane-modified polymer and one technology of tape, a double coated acrylic <b>foam</b> <b>tape</b> are tested. The result shows that all the adhesives fails cohesively and that tape fails partly adhesively. Result shows that all tests are affected by water, temperature and chemicals on different levels but tape is affected the most with a minimum of 40 % loss in shear strength. Watertightness test shows that aged tape joints are not watertight. The polymer shows no signs of decreasing in shear strength and is watertight, but does become more viscous by aging. The report shows that a possible combination of adhesive and pretreatment that can withstand the effects of water, temperature and chemicals is found. The polymer presents a possibility to bond stainless steel with a simple pretreatment. Tape didn’t pass the test in a suitable way but presents opportunities if a sufficient pretreatment can be found. ...|$|E
40|$|Masters Research - Master of Philosophy (MPhil) The semi {{interlocking}} masonry (SIM) {{was originally}} designed and {{developed at the}} University of Newcastle for use in seismically active zones as an energy dissipation device in buildings. Interlocking SIM bricks are the primary units used in mortar-less walls or panel construction and are available in two types: mechanical (which use dowels) and topological (which use particular shapes). The interlocking prevents the relative out-of-plane movement, but allows for longitudinal relative movement along bed joints. As a mortar-less masonry system, SIM has unavoidable gaps in both its bedding and perpend joints. This reduces the overall performance of SIM walls in terms of thermal efficiency and water penetration. The main objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate water penetration and the thermal performance properties of dry-stacked SIM walls. Additionally, this study aimed to determine whether an alternative construction technique (i. e., the use gap-fillers) led to any improvement in the properties. Two standard test methodologies (i. e., ASTM E 514 and C 1363) were used to evaluate water and heat transfer through walls. Non-adhesive putty and <b>foam</b> <b>tape</b> were used as gap-fillers to examine the potential improvement in restricting water and heat transfers and their suitability for intended application. In the water penetration experiment, the performance results of a traditional masonry wall were used as the benchmark against which the results of the SIM wall were compared. The results of the water penetration tests showed a high volume of leaked water through the dry-stacked SIM wall compared to the gap-filled SIM wall. The traditional masonry wall had the least amount of water leakage followed by the topological SIM wall that used putty. However, the area of dampness in the traditional masonry wall was higher than the area of dampness in the gap-filled SIM walls. In the second part of this study, a hot box apparatus was used to evaluate the thermal properties of the gap-filled SIM walls. The results of thermal tests showed that the thermal resistance of the SIM wall was equal to the traditional concrete masonry wall. It was also found that the type of gap-filler used had a slight effect on the thermal performance of the SIM walls. However, the SIM walls with the putty was more thermally efficient...|$|E

5000|$|Every {{year since}} 1996 a large LARP has been {{organised}} at the venue. The Great Battle of Bicolline brings together around 2000 LARPers and medieval reenactors over seven days, and culminates {{in a huge}} battle. The battle is prepared for throughout the year with skirmishes and diplomacy between the various groups that attend. Everyone in attendance must dress up medieval at all times,and all modern items, such as cellphones are put away and unused. All participants submerge themselves {{into the world of}} Bicolline, getting into their roles and characters and the real world is left behind. Every detail, {{all the way down to}} the utensils used must be decorum in order to create the medieval atmosphere. The large grounds are filled with many houses as well as medieval tents. There is also some designated areas where those with regular camping tents may be placed in order to minimize the viewing of modern items. Throughout the week there are several events and activities; each night there is a musical spectacle as well as a show, there are competitions and small battles which lead up to the Great Battle, as well as activities and small battles for the children. The Great Battle takes place on the last day of the week (Saturday) and normally endures between 3 and 4 hours long. Each year there is a new scenario based on the events and occurrences throughout the year in the [...] "virtual world." [...] There are specific rules in place in order to assure safety. The age limit in order to participate in the Battle is sixteen. Upon entry into the ground, each person is given a colored bracelet according to age. Those who are under sixteen upon registration must wear a child bracelet. Those who are sixteen and older wear a different colored bracelet, ensuring that those who aren't of age are mistaken to be over sixteen. Weapons are also checked by the workers of Bicolline and are marked in order to ensure the safety of players and ensure that no unsafe weapon is used during the battle. Weapons such as swords and daggers are normally made out of foam and arrows are tipped with large amounts of <b>foam</b> and <b>tape</b> in order to avoid serious injury. There are even vendors that make and sell weapons that have already been checked and approved by Bicolline. Most participants also wear armors in leather or metal which allow for protection throughout the battle. With armor worn, a point system applies and it then takes a certain amount of [...] "touches" [...] by a weapon in order to be considered injured or dead, depending on placement of armor and where the weapon has touched the body.|$|R
