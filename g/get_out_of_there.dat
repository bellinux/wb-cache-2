500|$|One {{scene that}} {{was cut from}} the film {{occurred}} during Ripley's final escape from the Nostromo: she encounters Dallas and Brett who have been partially cocooned by the Alien. O'Bannon had intended the scene to indicate that Brett was becoming an alien egg while Dallas was held nearby to be implanted by the resulting facehugger. Production Designer Michael Seymour later suggested that Dallas had [...] "become sort of food for the alien creature", while Ivor Powell suggested that [...] "Dallas {{is found in the}} ship as an egg, still alive." [...] Scott remarked that [...] "they're morphing, metamorphosing, they are changing into...being consumed, I guess, by whatever the Alien's organism is...into an egg." [...] The scene was cut partly because it did not look realistic enough, but also because it slowed the pace of the escape sequence. Tom Skerritt remarked that [...] "The picture had to have that pace. Her trying {{to get the hell out}} of there, we're all rooting for her to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>there,</b> and for her to slow up and have a conversation with Dallas was not appropriate." [...] The footage was included with other deleted scenes as a special feature on the Laserdisc release of Alien, and a shortened version of it was re-inserted into the 2003 Director's Cut which was re-released in theaters and on DVD.|$|E
500|$|As {{of the end}} of this episode, {{the status}} of three main {{characters}} remained undetermined. Niki Sanders was last seen inside a burning building which subsequently exploded, and Nathan Petrelli was shot while attempting to speak out against the Company. Their fates were left intentionally ambiguous because the writers were unsure of whether they wanted to proceed with Niki and Nathan's characters; decisions were made following the Writers' Strike resolution. As for the fate of Adam Monroe, Kring was more direct, saying [...] "we've given the audience {{no reason to believe that}} Adam can figure a way to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>there.</b> The fact that he can live forever makes this the most gruesome of internments. If this happened to any of us, at least we'd know we'd soon have the mercy of death. Not here." [...] Two of the series' villains also saw changes. Elle's decision to take on Sylar gave her a chance to use her abilities to help rather than to hurt people. Kring says [...] "she's been given an opportunity to use her powers in a good way. And she absolutely likes the sound of that word 'hero'." [...] Sylar's use of the stolen sample of Claire Bennet's blood led to the restoration of his abilities. According to Kring, [...] "Sylar getting his power back does not bode well for our heroes." [...] Originally, Sylar was not supposed to get his abilities back due to Zachary Quinto's commitment to the new Star Trek film. However, due to the Writers' Strike, Quinto completed his role in the film by the time Heroes returned to production.|$|E
2500|$|About ninety animators {{worked on}} the film {{at one point or}} another; some {{worked on the}} project for as long as two years. [...] In terms of the film's {{animation}} style and settings, the film combines Eastern world culture (predominantly Japanese) with Western world culture (predominantly California). In May 2013, Disney released concept art and rendered footage of San Fransokyo from the film. San Fransokyo, the futuristic mashup of San Francisco and Tokyo, was described by Hall as [...] "an alternate version of San Francisco. Most of the technology is advanced, but much of it feels retro … Where Hiro lives, it feels like the Haight. I love the Painted ladies. We gave them a Japanese makeover; we put a cafe on the bottom of one. They live above a coffee shop." [...] According to production designer Paul Felix, [...] "The topography is exaggerated because what we do is caricature, I think the hills are 1½ times exaggerated. I don't think you could really walk up them … When you get to the downtown area, that's when you get the most Tokyo-fied, that pure, layered, dense kind of feeling of the commercial district there. When you <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>there,</b> it becomes more San Francisco with the Japanese aesthetic. … (It's a bit like) Blade Runner, but contained to a few square blocks. You see the skyscrapers contrasted with the hills." ...|$|E

2500|$|Late {{at night}} after the {{landlord}} left, Wanrow and Hooper became frightened, although they had the pistol with them. [...] They invited Wanrow's sister and brother-in-law to the house, who arrived with three of their children. [...] The four adults did not sleep {{in order to better}} guard against any possible aggression. [...] At about five o'clock in the morning, unbeknownst to the women in the house, Wanrow's brother-in-law went to Wesler's residence and accused him of pedophilia. [...] Wesler was intoxicated, and he and an associate were persuaded to return to the Hooper home to reconcile their differences. [...] As Wesler attempted to enter the residence, Hooper yelled at him to <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>there,</b> causing some commotion. [...] Wanrow's three-year-old nephew awoke and began crying, prompting Wesler, who had by this time entered the home, to state, [...] "My, what a cute little boy". [...] Wesler made a move for the child, which upset his mother, Wanrow's sister. [...] An emotional situation developed during which Wanrow drew her pistol and shot and killed Wesler. [...] His associate was also hit, but he survived and fled. [...] Hooper called Crime Check (similar to 911), and the call was recorded. [...] During the conversation, the telephone was passed to Wanrow, who confessed to the killing and expressed a distrust of the police. [...] Although she was upset, Wanrow was not screaming. [...] The stereotype of a [...] "hysterical woman" [...] was used against her by the prosecution to persuade the jury that she was calm. [...] This recording was to play prominently in her conviction and in its subsequent overturn.|$|E
