40|$|To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} <b>eniluracil</b> on colorectal tumor dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) activity. Patients who were to undergo primary colorectal tumor resection received oral <b>eniluracil</b> 10 mg/m(2) twice daily for 3 days before surgery. Mononuclear cells were obtained before the start of <b>eniluracil</b> and on the morning of surgery, to measure DPD activity, protein, and mRNA. Plasma uracil was also measured at these two time points to assess the effect of <b>eniluracil</b> on pyrimidine accumulation. DPD activity, protein, and mRNA were also assessed in colorectal tumors and adjacent normal mucosa of patients who received <b>eniluracil</b> and untreated control patients. DPD activity in tumors from 10 untreated patients ranged from 30 to 92 pmol/min/mg of protein. In contrast, there was no detectable tumor DPD activity in 10 patients who received <b>eniluracil.</b> A similar pattern was observed in mononuclear cells, where median pretherapy activity was 366. 5 pmol/min/mg of protein (range, 265 to 494 pmol/min/mg of protein) and was undetectable immediately before surgery. Plasma uracil changed from a median less than 0. 2 micromol/L before therapy to 27. 76 micromol/L before surgery. No difference in DPD protein or mRNA was observed between pretherapy and presurgery mononuclear cell samples or between treated and untreated tumor samples. This study provides definitive evidence that <b>eniluracil</b> completely inactivates DPD activity in human solid tumors. The increased plasma uracil and decreased DPD activity are consistent with systemic inactivation of the enzyme. The mechanism of inactivation is at the catalytic level, because no changes in DPD protein or mRNA were observed. Treatment with <b>eniluracil</b> will eliminate DPD activity as a source of pharmacokinetic fluorouracil variability or resistance in human colorectal cance...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Eniluracil</b> is a potent, {{irreversible}} inactivator of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, {{the major}} catabolic enzyme for 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU). Pretreatment with <b>eniluracil</b> significantly increases plasma half-life, plasma concentration and oral bioavailability of 5 -FU. This multicenter phase II trial {{was designed to}} estimate the 6 -month survival rate in patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with 5 -FU and <b>eniluracil.</b> Patients and methods: One hundred and sixteen patients (61 with no prior chemotherapy and 55 with prior chemotherapy) were registered for treatment with <b>eniluracil</b> 50 mg (total dose) p. o. on days 1 – 7 and 5 -FU 20 mg/m 2 /day p. o. on days 2 – 6 of a 28 -day treatment cycle.

Concurrent {{administration}} of oral <b>eniluracil</b> with oral 5 -FU not only increases the bioavailability of 5 -FU, owing to elimination of first-pass metabolism, but {{can change the}} route of elimination of 5 -FU from hepatic metabolism to renal excretion. An open-label study was performed {{to determine the effect}} of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of 5 -FU in the presence of <b>eniluracil.</b> Enrolled in the study were 17 patients with refractory solid tumours (Karnofsky performance status >/= 70 %; age 31 - 74 years; 12 male, 5 female). The patients were separated into two groups based upon creatinine clearance (CLCr) : group A had "normal" renal function arbitrarily defined as CLCr >/= 50 ml/min (n= 8), and group B had moderate renal impairment, i. e. CLCr 50 ml/min. The combination can also be given to patients with renal impairment using a test dose and pharmacokinetic measurements to predict the appropriate dose of 5 -FU. It is expected that sufficient information will be available from this and other studies to allow accurate prediction of the appropriate 5 -FU dose modifications required in patients with renal impairmen...|$|E
40|$|Detailed {{analysis}} of X-ray diffraction data from four single crystals of <b>eniluracil,</b> prepared under different crystallization conditions, confirms {{a picture in}} which the crystals exhibit different degrees of disorder, which is also suggested by the computed low energy crystal structures. Since several of these crystal structures that effectively differ by an interchange of the oxygen and hydrogen atoms on C(4) and C(6) are essentially equi-energetic, growth errors that {{may be difficult to}} reverse are practically inevitable. The structural variations observed for the crystals of <b>eniluracil</b> studied are more appropriately described in terms of variable degrees of disorder rather than polymorphism. Analysis of the computed crystal energy landscape for interchangeable hydrogen-bonded (or other strong) motifs is, therefore, shown to be a valuable complement to X-ray diffraction and solid-state NMR for understanding and characterizing disorder in organic solid state systems. In the case of <b>eniluracil,</b> this detailed picture probably accounts for the challenges in devising a robust production process for this anticancer agent in the 1990 s. The specific nature of the disorder accounts for different structures being obtained from powder X-ray diffraction data of different samples, and the possibility of publishable single crystal X-ray refinements also being interpreted as polymorphism rather than disorder...|$|E
40|$|Noninvasive {{methods for}} {{measuring}} the pharmacokinetics of chemo-therapeutic drugs such as 5 -fluorouracil (FU) are needed for individu-alized optimization of treatment regimens. PET imaging of [18 F]FU (PET/[18 F]FU) is potentially useful in this context, but PET/[18 F]FU is severely hampered by low tumor uptake of radiolabel and rapid catabolism of FU in vivo. Pretreatment with <b>eniluracil</b> (5 -ethynyluracil) prevents catabolism of FU.

40|$|Tumor {{and normal}} tissue {{pharmacokinetics}} of 5 -Fluorouracil (5 -FU) in patients {{can be determined}} with positron emission tomography scanning. However, the data obtained are of limited value because of the inability to distinguish catabolites (inactive species) from parent 5 -FU and anabolites (cytotoxic species). In this paper, we have blocked 5 -FU catabolism in one arm of a paired study with <b>eniluracil,</b> an inactivator of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, enabling catabolite correction and calculation of tissue pharmacokinetic parameters to be achieved. Using this novel approach, we report {{for the first time}} that the net clearance of 5 - [18 F]FU from plasma into tumors (liver metastases and pancreatic tumor) of patients is low (K I � 0. 0033 � 0. 0005 ml plasma/ml tissue/min). In contrast, the initial (up to 10 min) clearance through catabolism in liver was high (K I � 0. 7313 � 0. 092 ml plasma/ml tissue/min). In the absence of <b>eniluracil,</b> catabolites in tumors accounted for 83 % of total tumor exposure (range, 66 – 91 %), whereas catabolites in liver accounted for 96 % of total liver exposure (range, 94 – 98 %). This study provides definitive evidence that the cytotoxicity of 5 -FU in patients with gastrointestinal cancer could be compromised by its intrinsically low uptake by tumors, as well as decreased systemic availability through hepatic catabolism...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Eniluracil</b> is an {{effective}} inactivator of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, the initial and rate limiting enzyme in the catabolism of fluorouracil. The current study was done to determine the objective tumour response of a 28 -day oral regimen of eniluracil-fluorouracil in patients with advanced breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a multicentre, phase II study in patients with anthracycline-refractory (AR) or anthracycline- and taxane-refractory (ATR) advanced breast cancer. Oral <b>eniluracil</b> (10 mg/m 2) and fluorouracil (1 mg/m 2) were taken twice daily for 28 days of each 35 -day treatment course. RESULTS: In this study, 106 patients received treatment: 62 patients in the AR stratum and 44 patients in the ATR stratum. The objective tumour response rate in the intent-to-treat population was 18 % (95 % confidence intervals (CI) : 11 %- 27 %), including three complete responses. The response rate was similar in both strata: 19 % in the AR and 16 % in the ATR stratum. The overall median duration of response was 23. 6 weeks. The treatment was well tolerated with a low incidence of grade 3 or 4 toxicities that were considered attributable to study medication. CONCLUSION: Treatment with oral eniluracil-fluorouracil was well tolerated by patients with advanced breast cancer. The efficacy data were comparable {{with those of other}} published studies in this group of refractory patients.

40|$|Modelling of {{disorder}} in organic crystals is highly desirable {{since it would}} allow thermodynamic stabilities and other disorder-sensitive properties to be estimated for such systems. Two disordered organic molecular systems are modeled using a symmetry-adapted ensemble approach, in which the disordered system is treated as an ensemble of the configurations of a supercell with respect to substitution of one disorder component for another. Computation time is kept manageable by performing calculations only on the symmetrically inequivalent configurations. Calculations are presented on a substitutionally disordered system, the dichloro/dibromobenzene solid solution, and on an orientationally disordered system, <b>eniluracil,</b> and the resultant free energies, disorder patterns, and system properties are discussed. The results {{are found to be}} in agreement with experiment following manual removal of physically implausible configurations from ensemble averages, highlighting the dangers of a completely automated approach to organic crystal thermodynamics which ignores the barriers to equilibration once the crystal has been formed...|$|E
40|$|The {{combination}} of 5 -fluorouracil and leucovorin {{is the standard}} treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer and in Dukes' C colon cancer. There is, however, no agreement on the method for administration in metastatic colorectal cancer. Several new studies published in 1998 suggest that infusional 5 -fluorouracil gives a higher response rate and better toxicity profile compared with a standard bolus 5 -fluorouracil/leucovorin regimen. The median survival rate, however, is not different. Several new active drugs are being developed for advanced colorectal cancer. It {{has not yet been}} shown that these drugs as single agents are superior to an optimal 5 -fluorouracil regimen. Combination trials of 5 -fluorouracil/leucovorin with oxaliplatin, CPT- 11 and raltitrexed are ongoing, and it can be expected that several of these combinations will be more active than 5 -fluorouracil/leucovorin. The challenge for the future will be to show the most active combination and the best sequence of these combinations. The development of the orally administered fluoropyrimidines was rapid in 1998.

40|$|The {{synthetic}} chemotherapeutic agent, 5 -FU, {{has been}} used for the treatment of a variety cancers, with colorectal cancer being among the most susceptible. Administration of 5 -FU by continuous intravenous infusion has proven to yield greater antitumor efficacy and lower hematotoxicity compared to administration of 5 -FU by intravenous bolus injections. Nevertheless, systemic application of 5 -FU is often limited by its narrow therapeutic threshold, and therefore in certain situations, such as tumor resection, it may be more appropriate to provide local rather than systemic delivery of 5 -FU. It was therefore proposed that 5 -FU loaded PLGA millirods may be capable of providing sustained release of 5 -FU at a local level which may have equivalent or greater antitumor activity and less cytotoxicity than the systemic or local delivery of soluble 5 -FU. PLGA millirods loaded with 5 -FU were successfully fabricated by a hot-melt extrusion technique and characterized for in vitro and in vivo release rates. It was demonstrated that percentage loading by weight of 5 -FU could be adjusted to modify its release kinetics. It was also shown that millirods could be stably stored under a variety of conditions for at least 2 months. An optimal millirod formulation (PLGA 50 : 50 loaded with 5 -FU (50 % w/w)) was tested for antitumor activity and general toxicity in vivo. At the dose of 120 mg/kg 5 -FU, millirods (delivered peritumorally) were efficacious (with 100 % survival rates) against solid thymomas in tumor-challenged mice (causing complete regression). Whilst the soluble form of 5 -FU (delivered intraperitoneally (IP) at 120 mg/kg) was also highly efficacious (90 % survival rates) against thymomas it was also more hematotoxic. In addition, the millirod form provided significantly greater antitumor activity against colorectal tumors in mice compared to the soluble form of 5 -FU. In terms of in vivo toxicity, surprisingly, the type of formulation did not {{have a significant effect on}} mouse weight despite both IP and subcutaneous (SC) delivery causing death of some mice. Importantly, it was found that 5 -FU loaded PLGA millirods were significantly less hematotoxic than soluble 5 -FU delivered by either IP or SC injection at the equivalent dose. Thus, locally implanted 5 -FU loaded PLGA millirods appeared to be less toxic and possessed overall greater antitumor potency than soluble 5 -FU delivered by IP or SC injection. This study further investigated whether the combination of 5 -FU loaded PLGA millirods with <b>eniluracil</b> (in both thymoma and colorectal tumor models) or immune checkpoint inhibitors (in the colorectal tumor model) could enhance the antitumor efficacy of 5 -FU millirods in mice challenged with colorectal tumors. It was found that the combination of 5 -FU loaded PLGA millirods and <b>eniluracil</b> (millirod or solution forms) did not significantly enhance the antitumor efficacy of 5 -FU millirods in either tumor models. It was also found that immune checkpoint inhibitors did not enhance the antitumor efficacy of 5 -FU loaded PLGA millirods in the colorectal tumor model...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{comparative}} phase II study of <b>eniluracil</b> plus 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) and leucovorin (Lv) vs. capeci-tabine, an oral 5 -FU prodrug for metastatic breast cancer (MBC), 10 evaluable patients with rapid disease progression (PD) during capecitabine treatment crossed over to take eniluracil/ 5 -FU/Lv. Of these patients, 3 had partial tumor response (PR), 6 had stable disease (SD), and 4 had> 7 months progression-free survival (PFS) with eniluracil/ 5 -FU/Lv treatment. Background: As part of {{a comparative}} phase II study of eniluracil/ 5 -FU/Lv vs. capecitabine (Xeloda), an oral 5 -FU prodrug for MBC, patients with rapid PD during capecitabine therapy crossed over to take eniluracil/ 5 -FU/Lv. Patients and Methods: Ten evaluable patients with radiologically documented PD within 70 days of capecitabine treatment were treated with a modified oral weekly eniluracil/ 5 -FU/Lv regimen. Results: After switching to eniluracil/ 5 -FU/Lv, 3 (30 %) patients had PR. Six (60 %) had SD, producing a total of 90 % with PR or SD. The median PFS was 140 days (vs. 42. 5 days for capecitabine). Four (40 %) patients had> 7 months PFS. Eniluracil/ 5 -FU/Lv was well tolerated with mild to moderate diarrhea and nausea as the most common side effects. Conclusion: These positive efficacy and safety results encourage a larger study in patients with rapid PD during capecitabine treatment. Eniluracil/ 5 -FU/Lv might enable these patients to continue with oral 5 -FU rather than switching to the generally less well tolerated intravenous microtubule-interfering agents. In addition, the eniluracil/ 5 -FU/Lv regimen might also provide any overall survival contribution of 5 -FU that, for pharmacokinetic reasons, was not provided by capecitabine {{and would not be}} provided if these patients progressed directly to the other approved treatments...|$|E
40|$|The {{fluoropyrimidine}} anticancer agent 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) {{is active}} {{in a wide range}} of solid tumors, particularly gastric, colorectal, and head and neck cancers. Whilst infusional 5 -FU is associated with higher response rates and a favorable safety profile as compared to the classical i. v. bolus administration, prolonged infusions can be inconvenient for the patients and catheter-related problems are common complications. An oral 5 -FU formulation would allow for sustained 5 -FU plasma concentrations, mimicking the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a continuous infusion with the addition of convenience of administration. The oral administration of 5 -FU itself is not feasible due to the high activity of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase in the gut wall, which causes rapid metabolism of the drug, and results in decreased and erratic absorption of 5 -FU and non-linear PK To bypass this problem, oral fluoropyrimidine derivatives were developed either in the form of 5 -FU prodrugs (i. e. tegafur, doxifluridine or capecitabine), or as enzyme inhibitors (i. e. <b>eniluracil)</b> administered with 5 -FU, or as both prodrugs and enzyme inhibitors (i. e. S- 1, UFT or BOF-A 2). This review will focus on the oral fluoropyrimidine S- 1, which consists of the 5 -FU prodrug tegafur (ftorafur, FT) and two enzyme inhibitors, i. e. CDHP (5 -chloro- 2, 4 -dihydroxypyridine) and OXO (potassium oxonate), in a molar ratio of 1 (FT) : 0. 4 (CDHP) : 1 (OXO). Phase II trials have demonstrated that S- 1, as a single agent, is active for the treatment of gastric, colorectal, head and neck, breast non-small cell lung, and pancreatic cancers. Phase III trials are currently underway in gastric cancer and these results are awaited to confirm the phase II findings. Furthermore, the combination of S- 1 with cisplatin (CDDP), irinotecan or docetaxel for the treatment of gastric cancer and with CDDP for non-small cell and pancreatic cancer is feasible and active. The activity observed with S- 1 in the phase II studies is at least equivalent, if not better, than continuous i. v. and bolus 5 -FU and the other oral fluoropyrimidines. Thus, we may finally be seeing the realization of oral treatments for the management of various solid tumors and could be on the brink of a new approach to treatment strategies. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The fluoropyrimidines {{were first}} {{synthesised}} nearly 50 {{years ago as}} 4 rationally designed anti-cancer agents. Their target was pyrimidine and hence DNA synthesis. 5 -Fluorouracil {{has been the most}} extensively used {{in a wide variety of}} malignancies. In more recent years a fuller understanding of the pharmacokinetics of these agents has lead to their utilisation as more effective and versatile anti-cancer drugs than might have been initially envisaged. This in part has occurred due to recognition of the schedule dependency of efficacy of 5 -FU and modulation of its activity by leucovorin. However the development of novel fluropyrimidines such as capcetabine, UFT, and <b>eniluracil</b> which can be administered orally, has offered equal if not superior efficacy with improved tolerability and patient acceptance. It is now recognised that enzyme polymorphism's and heterogeneity of expression of key molecules are important determinants of the pharmacokinetic handling and pharmacodynamic effects of these drugs in individual patients. Further characterisation of such interindividual and inter-tumoral variability, for example in enzymes such as DPD and thymidine phosphorylase is ongoing. This work offers the promise of improvements in efficacy and tolerability by the process of individualisation of chemotherapy (for both patient and tumour). In contrast to the advances made in the understanding of the pharmacokinetics, less progress has been made in Fluropyrimidine pharmacodynamics. The inhibition of thymidylate synthetase by dFUMP and thereby dTMP and DNA synthesis is thought to be the critical mechanism. The incorporation of FUTP and dFUTP into RNA and DNA are also postulated to be of importance. While these events have been well defined, exactly how they lead to cell death is less clearly understood. Similarly, the mechanism of selective cancer cell cytotoxicity is not well understood. Pharmacokinetics and cell cycle kinetics provide a partial explanation. There is some evidence to suggest that the most important factor in determining cytotoxicity is the cellular response to fluoropyrimidine induced biochemical abnormalities rather than the lesions themselves. In this hypothesis the difference in response between normal and cancer cells is of critical importance. Further improvements in efficacy and tolerability could be made by elucidation of the molecular mechanisms behind this process. This knowledge in combination with the advances already made (and ongoing) in pharmacokinetics may allow the full potential of fluoropyrimidines as anti-cancer agents to be realised in the future...|$|E
