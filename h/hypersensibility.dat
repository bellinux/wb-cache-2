40|$|Glucocorticoids (GCs) {{represent}} {{the most effective}} treatment for autoimmune and allergic diseases, even if collateral effects are not rare, especially endocrine and immunosuppressive manifestations. Moreover, these drugs can develop adverse immunological reactions of I, III or IV type. Though immediate adverse reactions caused by systemic therapy with GCs are not very frequent, the possible beginning of anaphylactic and pseudo-anaphylactic manifestations in patients undergoing therapy with these drugs has to be considered. It has been observed that immediate adverse reactions usually are happened in asthmatic patients and in patients obliged to assume GCs again and again because of their pathology (e. g, kidney transplant). Other risk factors resulted to be female sex and <b>hypersensibility</b> to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). Both {{in the cases of}} pseudo-allergic and allergic reactions, the pharmacological principle is hardly the responsible agent for the reaction; instead the excipients in drugs are often implicated (succinate salt, sulphites and carboxy-methyl-cellulose). It is possible that the IgE-response is highly specific for a fixed GC molecule as well depending on the way of administration and its salification. Moreover, it has been hypothesized that in patients with a first type allergic reaction to GCs there is a fourth type, sensitization to GCs, which is not usually diagnosed and even comes before IgE sensitization. Third type <b>hypersensibility</b> reactions may occur, too. Since GCs are large-scale drugs, also in emergency medicine and reanimation, allergic sensitization towards them, although infrequent, gives many interventionist problems. In the light of this feature, it seems of crucial importance to verify the tolerance toward other GC molecules. And in particular, it has been noted that patients presenting immediate reactions to hydrocortisone (HC) and methylprednisolone (MP) could tolerate prednisone and prednisolone per os and second-generation GCs, such as desamathazone and betamethazone. Nevertheless, second-generation GCs must not be considered safe; in fact, the beginning of allergic manifestations has been pointed out even towards them...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEnvenoming {{with brown}} spiders (Loxosceles genus) is common {{throughout}} the world. Cutaneous symptoms following spider bite accidents include dermonecrosis, erythema, itching and pain. In some cases, accidents can cause <b>hypersensibility</b> or even allergic reactions. These responses could {{be associated with}} histaminergic events, such as an increase in vascular permeability and vasodilatation. A protein that {{may be related to}} the effects of spider venom was identified from a previously obtained cDNA library of the L. intermedia venom gland. The amino acid sequence of this protein is homologous to proteins from the TCTP (translationally-controlled tumor protein) family, which are extracellular histamine-releasing factors (HRF) that are associated with the allergic reactions to parasites. Herein, we described the cloning, heterologous expression, purification and functional characterization of a novel member of the TCTP family from the Loxosceles intermedia venom gland. This recombinant protein, named LiRecTCTP, causes edema, enhances vascular permeability and is likely related to the inflammatory activity of the venom. Moreover, LiRecTCTP presents an immunological relationship with mammalian TCTPs...|$|E

40|$|International audienceCold {{hypersensitivity}} is {{the hallmark}} of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy, which develops in nearly all patients under this chemotherapy. To date, pain management strategies have failed to alleviate these symptoms, hence development of adapted analgesics is needed. Here, we report that oxaliplatin exaggerates cold perception in mice as well as in patients. These symptoms are mediated by primary afferent sensory neurons expressing the thermoreceptor TRPM 8. Mechanistically, oxaliplatin promotes over-excitability by drastically lowering the expression of distinct potassium channels (TREK 1, TRAAK) and by increasing the expression of pro-excitatory channels such as the hyperpolarization-activated channels (HCNs). These findings are corroborated by the analysis of TREK 1 -TRAAK null mice and use of the specific HCN inhibitor ivabradine, which abolishes the oxaliplatin-induced cold <b>hypersensibility.</b> These results suggest that oxaliplatin exacerbates cold perception by modulating the transcription of distinct ionic conductances that together shape sensory neuron responses to cold.

Various synthetic approaches based on immobilization or release of bactericidal substances such as metal derivatives, polyammonium salts and antibiotics were extensively explored to produce antibacterial coatings.

40|$|Abstract Streptococcal pharyngitis is a {{very common}} {{pathology}} in paediatric age all over the world. Nevertheless there isn't a joint agreement on the management of this condition. Some authors recommend to perform a microbiological investigation in suspected bacterial cases in order to treat the confirmed cases with antibiotics so to prevent suppurative complications and acute rheumatic fever. Differently, other authors consider pharyngitis, even streptococcal one, a benign, self-limiting disease. Consequently they wouldn't routinely perform microbiological tests and, pointing to a judicious use of antibiotics, they would reserve antimicrobial treatment to well-selected cases. It has been calculated {{that the number of}} patients needed to treat to prevent one complication after upper respiratory tract infections (including sore throat), was over 4000. Even the use of the Centor score, in order to evaluate the risk of streptococcal infection, is under debate and the interpretation of the test results may vary considerably. Penicillin is considered all over the world as first line treatment, but oral amoxicillin is also accepted and, due to its better palatability, can be a suitable option.

40|$|All the {{anomalous}} reactions {{secondary to}} food ingestion {{are defined as}} 'adverse reactions to food'. In 1995 the European Academy of Allergology and Clinical Immunology suggested a classification {{on the basis of}} the responsible pathogenetic mechanism; according to this classification, non-toxic reactions can be divided into 'food allergies' when they recognize immunological mechanisms, and 'food intolerances' when there are no immunological implications. The diagnostic approach to adverse reactions to food is based on accurate clinical history and objective examination, and further execution of specific tests when allergy or intolerance is suspected. The therapy for food allergies is the elimination of the food to which <b>hypersensibility</b> has been found; this strategy can lead, especially in pediatric age, to tolerance. If elimination diets cannot be completely performed, or if it is not possible to identify the food to eliminate, some drugs (e. g. antihistaminics, steroids, etc.) can be administered. Specific allergen immunotherapy has been recently introduced. Fundamental is food allergy prevention, especially in high-risk subjects. The therapeutic approach to secondary food intolerances is based principally on primitive disease resolution; on the other hand, some specific treatments (e. g. beta-galactosidases in lactose malabsorption) are available in case of primary intolerance. 2008 S.

40|$|Objectives: Atypical {{antipsychotics}} commonly cause isolated asymptomatic {{increase in}} the aminotransferase levels. Furthermore, the strategy {{in the choice of}} antipsychotic agent must take into account hepatic tolerance because of the non-negligible incidence of liver disorders among the psychiatric population. The aim {{of this article is to}} better understand the strategy to adopt during an increase of liver enzymes in a psychotic patient under atypical neuroleptic treatment. Method: A clinical case is presented of a female patient treated for psychotic decompensation with increase of liver enzymes (Olanzapine). Her treatment was changed several times over a period of 7 years and labatory investigations were conducted simultaneously. Results: it seems that the increase of liver enzymes is slightly more frequent with Clozapine and Olanzapine than Risperidone, Perazine and Haloperiol. Conclusion: the different mechanisms of hepatotoxicity are unknown at present but it seems that the <b>hypersensibility</b> mechanism is likely to be dose dependent. During an increase of enzymes, it is important to combine a control of hepatic enzymes with a reduction of neuroleptic dosage. Discontinuation should be considered if a continued increase of enzymes above certain values is shown or if a clinical symptom appears.

This condition is frequent in individuals with genetic predisposition. Frequency of food allergies in childhood varies in general population from 0. 3 - 7. 5 %. Characteristics of neonatal and infant gastrointestinal tracts are described as well as the role of gastrointestinal tract’s immunological immaturity in development of food sensitivity. Pathogenesis Features of physical and immunological barriers of gastrointestinal tract are described as well as their role in physiological conditions, in digestion and absorption of foreign proteins and prevention of foreign agents penetration and potentially dangerous proteins into the systemic circulation. Gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is the basic part of immunological barrier. Its first role is to induce oral tolerance. In normal conditions cytokines induce T cells towards Th 2 response and also promote synthesis of IgA antibodies Pathogenic mechanisms in evolution of reaginic <b>hypersensibility</b> in cases of chronic inflammation are also described.

40|$|Overactive bladder is a {{specific}} syndrome characterized by bladder dysfunction that is clinically manifested by imperative urination (pollakiuria, urgency, urgent incontinence and nocturia). This state is very widely spread among children: every fifth child aged 4 to 7 shows typical bladder dysfunction. Quite often if urinary distresses are not studied well enough such children are falsely diagnosed with monosymptom enuresis, which, according to our information, actually happens in only 3, 9 % of cases. When examining children with urinary disorders {{it is reasonable to}} be geared to the protocol of European urologist association. According to this protocol, treatment should be started with antimuscarinimedications. The only antimuscarinic medication for treating children with hyperactive bladder that is legal in Russia is oxybutinin (Driptane), that is presently considered to be the «golden standard» of pharmaceutical treatment of overactive bladder for patients of any age. This statement is based on the modern idea of overactive bladder pathogenesis, that presupposes detrusorhypersensibility to acetylcholine. However, in some cases it might be reasonable to use some other medications, physiotherapy, sometimes as part of complex therapy. If individual dosage is observed, which will enable preventing or significantly lowering possible side effects, oxybutinin will be still considered «the golden standard» for treating overactive bladder for years to come in cases when detrusor <b>hypersensibility</b> to acetylcholine is the key component of bladder dysfunction pathogenesis.

The aim is to view this short story in light of Poe's empirically documented destructive personality, proposing that the message of the story, in itself, is more than simply a tale, but part of a larger contextual idea sprung from the pained soul of the author. As primary source for the hypothesis statement, theories by Freud and the later constructions on psychoanalysis as a tool for interpreting literature have been used, such as the collected works of Kurzweil & Phillips (Literature and Psychoanalysis). Further reference will be made to extensive autobiographical works on Poe himself, combined with specific research within the psychoanalytical field by authors such as Dr. Liebig (Criminal Insanity and <b>Hypersensibility</b> in Edgar Allan Poe), M. Bonaparte (The Life and Works of E. A. Poe, a psycho-analytic interpretation) and more. The results of this paper found that the dysfunctional lifestyle and neurotic tendencies of Edgar Allan Poe strongly indicate a connection between his psychological state, his experiences and the message of The Imp of the Perverse. The claim, then, is that Edgar Allan Poe did indeed fuel his short story with direct elements of his own psyche and moral values...|$|E
40|$|The {{inflammatory}} response {{is probably one}} of the main destructive events occurring after spinal cord injury (SCI). Its progression depends mostly on the autoimmune response developed against neural constituents. Therefore, modulation or inhibition of this self-reactive reaction could help to reduce tissue destruction. Anterior chamber associated immune deviation (ACAID) is a phenomenon that induces immune-tolerance to antigens injected into the eye´s anterior chamber, provoking the reduction of such immune response. In the light of this notion, induction of ACAID to neural constituents could be used as a potential prophylactic therapy to promote neuroprotection. In order to evaluate this approach, three experiments were performed. In the first one, the capability to induce ACAID of the spinal cord extract (SCE) and the myelin basic protein (MBP) was evaluated. Using the delayed type <b>hypersensibility</b> assay (DTH) we demonstrated that both, SCE and MBP were capable of inducing ACAID. In the second experiment we evaluated the effect of SCE-induced ACAID on neurological and morphological recovery after SCI. In the results, there was a significant improvement of motor recovery, nociceptive hypersensitivity and motoneuron survival in rats with SCE-induced ACAID. Moreover, ACAID also up-regulated the expression of genes encoding for anti-inflammatory cytokines and FoxP 3 but down-regulated those for pro-inflamatory cytokines. Finally, in the third experiment, the effect of a more simple and practical strategy was evaluated: MBP-induced ACAID, we also found significant neurological and morphological outcomes. In the present study we demonstrate that the induction of ACAID against neural antigens in rats, promotes neuroprotection after SCI...|$|E

40|$|Larvae of Oestrus ovis (Insecta: Diptera: Oestridae) {{are common}} parasites of nasal and sinus {{cavities}} of sheep and goats. During larval development, a specific immune reaction is {{initiated by the}} host with a humoral local and systemic response and the recruitment of eosinophils and mast cells in the upper airways mucosae. Nevertheless, the roles of these responses in the regulation of O. ovis larvae populations in sheep are not yet known. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the establishment and the development of larvae as well as some inflammatory or immune parameters between different groups of half-sibling sheep:(i) a primed group experimentally infected twice before a challenge infection, (ii and iii) two groups infected once only and previously treated with a long-lasting corticoïd before the challenge (one group) or not (the other group). A fourth group of noninfected animals was added in the experimental design. The larval establishment rate was 23 % in the corticoïd treated group compared to about 10 % in the two other infected groups. Moreover, the larval development appeared more rapid in the corticoïd treated group than in the two other infected groups suggesting that the inflammatory response is involved in the regulation of O. ovis populations. By contrast, no differences in the establishment rates were shown in the primed group compared to the naïve group (without corticoïd treatment) despite evidence of higher eosinophilia, serum specific IgG, and immediate <b>hypersensibility</b> to excretory–secretory products of larvae. The specific lymphocyte proliferation was reduced in the primed group compared to the naïve one suggesting that an immuno-suppression occurs following repetitive O. ovis infections...|$|E
40|$|Atopic {{dermatitis}} (AD) displays different clinical symptoms, progress, {{and response}} to treatment during early infancy and after childhood. After the childhood period, itch appears first, followed by formation of well-circumscribed plaque or polymorphous dermatoses at the same site. When accompanied with dermatitis and dry skin, treatment of skin lesions should be prioritized. When itch appears first, disease history, such as causes and time of appearance of itch should be obtained by history taking. In many cases, itch increases in the evening when the sympathetic nerve activity decreased. Treatment is provided considering that hypersensitivity to various external stimulations can cause itch. Heat and sweating are thought to especially exacerbate itch. Factors causing itch, such as cytokines and chemical messengers, also induce itch mainly by stimulating the nerve. Scratching further aggravates dermatitis. Skin <b>hypersensibility,</b> where other non-itch senses, such as pain and heat, are felt as itch, sometimes occurs in AD. Abnormal elongation of the sensory nerve into the epidermis, as well as sensitizing of the peripheral/central nerve, are possible causes of hypersensitivity, leading to itch. To control itch induced by environmental factors such as heat, treatment for dermatitis is given priority. In the background of itch exacerbated by sweating, attention {{should be given to}} the negative impact of sweat on skin homeostasis due to 1) leaving excess sweat on the skin, and 2) heat retention due to insufficient sweating. Excess sweat on the skin should be properly wiped off, and dermatitis should be controlled so that appropriate amount of sweat can be produced. Not only stimulation from the skin surface, but also visual and auditory stimulation can induce new itch. This “contagious itch” can be notably observed in patients with AD.

A associação entre essas reações revelou que, embora a maioria dos pacientes com reação imediata positiva apresentasse negatividade à reação tardia, 20, 8 % apresentaram positividade para as duas fases da reação. Dos pacientes não reatores à fase tardia, oito foram submetidos a outros testes cutâneos: PPD, estreptoquinase, candidina, vacínia e DNCB, verificando-se imunidade celular conservada em 75 % dos casos. Estes resultados sugerem que, quando da utilização dessa prova na avaliação imunológica de pacientes com dermatofitose, deve-se {{considerar}} o estado imune geral do paciente, a presença de hipersensibilidade imediata e a localização da infecção. The authors {{investigated the}} specific immunological competence of 31 patients with dermatophytosis using tricophytin antigen. Among them, 54. 8 % showed {{reaction to the}} delay phase (48 h) in the following proportions: tinea inguinale, 75 %; tinea pedis, 61. 5 %; tinea unguium, 50 % and tinea corporis, 20 %. Other 62. 5 % showed positive result to the early phase (30 m). The association between these reactions revealed that, {{although the majority of}} cases with early positive reaction showed negativity to the delayed reaction, 20. 8 % presented positivity to both phases of the reaction. Out of the non-reactive patients to the delayed phase, 8 were submitted to the other cutaneous tests such as PPD, streptokinase, candidin, vaccinia and DNCB and showed preserved cellular immunity in 75 %. These results suggest that, while using this reaction for immunological evaluation of patients with dermatophytosis, one should consider the overall immune status of the patient, the presence of early <b>hypersensibility</b> and the localization of the infection...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Nerve injury-triggered {{hyperexcitability}} {{in primary}} sensory neurons {{is considered a}} major source of chronic neuropathic pain. The hyperexcitability, in turn, is thought to be related to transcriptional switching in afferent cell somata. Analysis using expression microarrays has revealed that many genes are regulated in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) following axotomy. But which contribute to pain phenotype versus other nerve injury-evoked processes such as nerve regeneration? Using the L 5 spinal nerve ligation model of neuropathy we examined differential changes in gene expression in the L 5 (and L 4) DRGs in five mouse strains with contrasting susceptibility to neuropathic pain. We sought genes for which the degree of regulation correlates with strain-specific pain phenotype. Results In an initial experiment six candidate genes previously identified as important in pain physiology were selected for in situ hybridization to DRG sections. Among these, regulation of the Na + channel α subunit Scn 11 a correlated with levels of spontaneous pain behavior, and regulation of the cool receptor Trpm 8 correlated with heat <b>hypersensibility.</b> In a larger scale experiment, mRNA extracted from individual mouse DRGs was processed on Affymetrix whole-genome expression microarrays. Overall, 2552 ± 477 transcripts were significantly regulated in the axotomized L 5 DRG 3 days postoperatively. However, in {{only a small fraction of}} these was the degree of regulation correlated with pain behavior across strains. Very few genes in the "uninjured" L 4 DRG showed altered expression (24 ± 28). Conclusion Correlational analysis based on in situ hybridization provided evidence that differential regulation of Scn 11 a and Trpm 8 contributes to across-strain variability in pain phenotype. This does not, of course, constitute evidence that the others are unrelated to pain. Correlational analysis based on microarray data yielded a larger "look-up table" of genes whose regulation likely contributes to pain variability. While this list is enriched in genes of potential importance for pain physiology, and is relatively free of the bias inherent in the candidate gene approach, additional steps are required to clarify which transcripts on the list are in fact of functional importance. </p...|$|E
40|$|In an {{introduction}} to our study we reviewed the different phases of human work related to grain and grain dust, the nosology resulting from exposure {{and the role of}} immune mechanisms involved in its pathogenese. The aim of th study was: 1. To evaluate the level of dust exposure of our population. 2. To analyze the contaminants of grain and its constituents. 3. To evaluate respiratory symptoms prevalence in workers exposed to cereal, in different phases of their work. 4. To correlate the symptoms with professional exposure. 5. To evaluate relevance of factors related to the exposed workers in symptoms prevalence. 6. To evaluate the presence of <b>hypersensibility</b> to grain and grain dust and its role in the pathogenese of symptoms and diseases indentified in our population. In our study we included four groups of workers: workers of a grain silo in the harbor of Lisbon, mill workers exposed to grain and flour, malt workers from a distillery and clerks who were used as control group. The work environment of exposed workers was studied, namely the manufacturing cycle, the level of grain dust in the atmosphere and the presence of fungi, bacteria and parasites in various samples of cereals. In what concerns the study, it consisted of the application of a questionnaire in order to verify the prevalence of respiratory, nasal, eye, systemc and skin complaints, chest Xray, pulmonary function testing, skin testing with commercial allergens and with extracts made with grain samples from the work place, and laboratorial studies. Conclusion: - In every work place with exposure, grain dust levels are higher than those admitted internationally and than those with harmful effects. - Grain and by-products contaminantion was intense and assorted being worrying the prsence of bacteria, fungi and acarus with proved pathogenic action. - The high prevalence of symptoms in all studied populations and the fact of being related, by a great number of workers, with the exposure to grain, reveal the aggressiveness of these products. The higher prevalence of Chronic Bronchitis, the appearence of Hay Fever and Extrinsic Allergic Alveolitis, the ventilation disorders and the higher prevalence of bronchial hyperactivity support this statement. - The existence or not of atopy has no relation with the appearence of symptoms. - The higher prevalence of positive skin tests with allergens related with exposure, the evidence of postive precipiting to some of the used extracts, show a hypersensitivity to grain and its by-products in exposed population. However, the lack of correlation between hypersensitivity and the existence of symptoms relted with exposure, exclude the hypothesis that the complains have an exclusive immunological genesis. - In what concerns the mechanisms of grain pathogenic action in humans, the identification, in our samples, of different micro-organisms, the proved allergizing power of some of them (Sitophilus granariua) and the pathogenic action of endotoxins produced by some identified bacteria (Erwinia herbicola), suggest the presence of various immunological and non-immunological mechanisms in the genesis of the reported complaintsAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|A {{number of}} skin and conjunctival {{reactions}} - such as Arthus' phenomenon and the tuberculin test -are based on this condition of <b>hypersensibility</b> and prove valuable tests for the antigenic properties of substances. These results are specific. The injection of streptococci does not give rise to sera agglutinating staphylococci; here however there is an obvious morphological difference. But the injection of, or infection with, B. Faratyphosus B. does not give rise to sera agglutinating B. Paratyphosus A.; but the two bacilli are morphologically indistinguishable and biologically very similar. Passive or active immunity for the one does not, however, confer any immunity for the other. The symptoms of infection are different, the toxins are therefore different. Immune sera {{were found to be}} capable of distinguishing further than this. The clinical pictures of epidemic cerebro-spinal fever due to any of the causative cocci are identical but four strains can be distinguished by agglutinating sera (Gordon 1907). These questions then arise. Are the toxins producing the symptoms of the disease or anaphylaxis identical with the "antigen"? Is it possible to remove the antigenic principal from, the body a bacterium, or other antigenic material? Finally, to what class of substances do antigens belong? The distinction between the antigenic products isolated from bacteria and from other parasites, from blood and other tissues, has been almost entirely based on relative solubility in different solvents. It has become customary to regard the fractions extracted by physiological saline and similar solvents as 'protein"; and those isolated by organic solvents, principally ether and alcohol, 'as "lipoids and fats". This - 3 - division, though questionable from the chemical standpoint, gives an initial grouping of antigens. It is so far unquestioned that the proteins are antigenic. Crystallised egg albumen will give rise to antibodies, Dakin and Dale (1919) have shown that whilst by chemical and physical means it is not yet possible to distinguish between the crystallised egg albumen of the hen and the duck; antigenically they are specific in action. Further, that on racemization of these compounds different pro-portions were obtained of the laevao- and dextro- forms of certain of the constituent amino-acids. In this case then, protein specificity is associated with differences of stereo-chemical configuration. Bierry, Henri and Pettit Auguste (1904) stated that the "Nucleo-proteins" - that portion of different organs of a dog which was soluble in 0. 2 % sodium carbonate and precipitated by acetic acid - when injected intraperitoneally into rabbits gave rise, in the serum of these rabbits, to products which were toxic for the organ from which they were prepared. Hence the serum of a rabbit inoculated with the nucleo-protein from dog's kidney when injected into a dog caused albuminuria. (1916) stated that the extracts of tissues with boiling water, yielding solutions of (2 -nucleo-proteins gave rise to anaphylactic reactions but that the extracts from the pancreas of the pig and the ox and the spleen of the latter showed no specificity. Gideon Wells (1913) considered that the nucleic acids showed little evidence of antigenic properties; and that the so-called nucleo-proteins were mixtures of all kinds, both from the cytologist's nucleus and from the cytoplasm, probably in part denaturised and capable of giving rise to non-specific precipitins and complement fixation, even when they have lost the power of inducing anaphylactic reactions. Apart from tissue extracts and such special antigens as Cobra venom and ricin, antigens may be placed in three classes. First, the haemolytic antigens, those which confer haemolytic properties on the serum. Secondly, bacterial antigens, those which are intimately connected with the problems of disease. Thirdly, other parasitic antigens which may be closely parallel with the processes of infection, as is hydatid fluid in tests for hydatid disease; or purely empirical, as is the extract of ox heart in the Wassermann reaction. The chemical nature of the antigenic substances in all three classes may ultimately prove the same; nevertheless it is convenient to consider them separately although the second and third classes at least are comparable in many respects.
