40|$|The {{evaluation}} of police enforcement {{has traditionally been}} a major activity of researchers {{in the field of}} road safety. As a result of this a large variety of methods have been evolved which limits international comparisons and distribution of best practice. Therefore the final aim of our research is the development of standardized methods for the assessment of <b>enforcement</b> <b>and</b> <b>non-compliance</b> and guidelines for their application. The present paper describes the first step in this effort. As a starting point a literature review is performed, which focuses on assessment methods and tools applied by evaluation studies throughout the world. Enforcement areas under consideration are speeding (subdivided into automatic and conventional enforcement), red-light running, non-use of safety belts and alcohol-impaired driving. For the purpose of classification the assessment methods reviewed are stratified in accordance with four categories of information, which derive from the rationale usually underlying evaluation studies of police enforcement and which illustrate the principal assumptions made about the relations between police activity and road safety. These categories are: indicators of enforcement activity; drivers’ attitudes; drivers’ behaviour; accident analysis. As a result four tables summarize descriptive variables and indicators used in the studies under review. These variables form a first version of a classification table that will be applied and modified at the next step of our research.

40|$|Regulatory <b>enforcement</b> <b>and</b> {{industrial}} <b>non-compliance</b> {{are very}} familiar issues in environmental protectlon and water resource management. Current thinking recognizes the insufficiency {{of the traditional}} regulatory enforcement structures that are based orthodox deterrence theory. There are, therefore increasing shlfts among some industrialized countrles towards "new regulatory reglmes" that focus on management styles, and forms of selfregulation, based on innovatlve and incentive devlce. However, the orthodox instruments remain the principie means for regulatory enforcement among many developing countries. Our goal in this paper ¡s {{to examine the effects}} of these (traditional) regulatory enforcement instruments on firm' compliance to wastewater standards in Kenya. We (i) examine the state of wastewater regulatory compliance and infractlons; (ii) construct and estímate a model of enforcement incidence based on monitorlng, inspections, warning letters, and court prosecutions; and (iii) discuss the linkages in the <b>enforcement</b> framework, <b>and</b> behaviour of firms).

5000|$|To deliver its objectives, direct {{regulation}} {{must ensure}} {{the highest level}} of compliance possible. This can be achieved through appropriate implementation <b>and</b> <b>enforcement.</b> <b>Non-compliance</b> to CAC regulation presents a serious challenge to its effectiveness [...] The manner in which CAC is enforced differs between countries. For example, in the USA, some regulators who are tasked with implementing CAC techniques are given rule-making powers. Whereas in the UK, regulatory standards are more commonly set by departments of government. This is achieved through both primary and secondary legislation which is subsequently exacted by regulatory bureaucracies. Regulation differs within countries as well, in the UK the current regulatory sanctioning system possesses variations between powers and practices among regulators. Enforcement of CAC often involves the use of uniform sanctions, this can result in small businesses feeling the burdens of regulation more severely than companies of a larger size.|$|R

40|$|The {{study is}} divided into five chapters. Chapter one {{provides}} {{the context in which}} the study is set, the focus and objectives of the study, its significance, and other preliminary issues including the hypothesis and literature survey. Chapter two first seeks to briefly portray the current state of human rights in Africa. In the second part, history and development of the African Union is traced, within the context of its predecessor - the OAU. Its third part extracts and analyses the specific human rights content of the AU Constitutionve Act and other relevant provisions, both independently and collectively; while its fourth part progresses to examine the conribution of the AU to human rights so far, by gauging and scrutinizing the human rights content of its summits. The fifth and final part scrutinizes the implications of the linkage of human rights to development and hence, its re-conceptualisation or otherwise, in Africa. Chapter three seeks to examine the extant implications of the AU human rights agenda on the existing human rights protection framework. First, it provides a brief overview of the existing regional human rights protection system, while its second part elucidates the human rights enforcement mechanisms that have been developed under the African Charter system. Its third part seeks to examine the problem of <b>enforcement</b> of, <b>and</b> <b>non-compliance</b> with human rights in Africa, with a view to understanding the problem, and forging a way forward. Its fourth part looks at the relationship between the AU and the existing human rights institutions within the context of the AU Constituve Act, while its concluding part addresses the latent risk of proliferation and redundancy that might attend the proposed creation of more human rights-oriented institutions under the AU/NEPAD; proposing rationalization of the same and the fusion of compatible mandates, with the view of avoiding unnecessary and expensive duplications. Chapter four seeks to present the probable picture of the fusion of the emerging and existing frameworks. Its first part sets out to describe, as well as explicate the justifications for the proposed human rights enforcement framework under the AU, citing models. Its second part seeks to explore the potentialities of trade as veritable tool of sanction within the proposed structure, while its concluding part seeks to do the same in relation to the device of peer pressure. The fifth and final chapter of the study seeks to draw some conclusions and further give recommendations on how the proposed hybrid framework can be achieved, while emphasizing the importance of such synergy as a feasible solution of the problem of human rights enforcement in Africa.

40|$|This article applies crisp set {{qualitative}} {{comparative analysis}} (csQCA) to gain insight in the compliance motivations and compliance behaviours of 101 Chinese farmers. It seeks {{to understand how}} eight motivations (capacity to comply, legal knowledge, deterrent effect of sanctions, cost-benefit analysis, descriptive social norms, morals, general duty to obey, and procedural justice) combine in compliant and non-compliant behaviour, and whether {{there is only one}} combination of motivations or several that lead to compliance <b>and</b> <b>non-compliance.</b> It illustrates how csQCA assists in making visible and analyzing situations of interacting compliance motivations (conjunctural causality) and situations where different combinations of motivations result in similar compliance behaviour (equifinality). It identifies symmetrical and non-symmetrical relationships between specific compliance motivations and compliance behaviours — indicating that motivations for non-compliance are not necessarily the opposite of those for compliance. This non-symmetry may logically be explained because deterrence plays a different role in compliance decisions than in non-compliance decisions. The article concludes by highlighting the relevance of such insights for theorizing on compliance <b>and</b> for law <b>enforcement,</b> <b>and</b> the limitations of the method applied...|$|R

40|$|Background: Non-persistence <b>and</b> <b>non-compliance</b> {{are common}} in women {{prescribed}} hormonal therapy for breast cancer, but {{little is known about}} their influence on recurrence. Methods: A nested case?control study of associations between hormonal therapy non-persistence <b>and</b> <b>non-compliance</b> <b>and</b> the risk of early recurrence in women with stage I?III breast cancer was undertaken. Cases, defined as women with a breast cancer recurrence within 4 years of hormonal therapy initiation, were matched to controls (1 : 5) by tumour stage and age. Conditional logistic regression was used to examine associations between early recurrence and hormonal therapy non-persistence <b>and</b> <b>non-compliance.</b> Results: Ninety-four women with breast cancer recurrence were matched to 458 controls. Women who were non-persistent ([gt-or-equal, slanted] 180 days without hormonal therapy) had a significantly increased adjusted recurrence odds ratio (OR) of 2. 88 (95 %CI 1. 11, 7. 46) compared with persistent women. There was no significant association between low compliance (OR 1. 30; 95 % CI 0. 74, 2. 30) and breast cancer recurrence. Conclusion: Hormonal therapy non-persistence is associated with a significantly higher risk of early recurrence in women with stage I?III oestrogen receptor (ER) -positive breast cancer. This finding is consistent with results from randomized studies of hormonal therapy treatment duration and suggests that interventions to target modifiable risk factors for non-persistence are required...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{documented}} positive correlations in industrial environments between employee perceptions {{of trust in}} their leadership, safety climate, and safety performance. However, no such studies exist for university research laboratory environments even though highly publicized incidents and fatalities have resulted in increased scrutiny of research laboratories. This study explored the relationships among the following four concepts 1) employee perceptions of trust in two levels of leadership [...] laboratory supervisor and principal investigator, 2) safety climate within the laboratory environment in the same two levels of leadership, 3) injury and illness data, <b>and</b> 4) <b>non-compliance</b> data at a Midwest AAU university. A questionnaire was used to collected employee perceptions of trust and safety climate. Injury, illness, <b>and</b> <b>non-compliance</b> data {{were obtained from the}} university. Descriptive statistics, correlations, and regression analysis were used to calculate the relationships between the variables. The major findings of this study include the following. There was a significant positive relationship between: 1) employee perceptions of trust in the principal investigator and the laboratory supervisor; 2) safety climate for the principal investigator and the laboratory supervisor; and 3) employee perceptions of trust in the principal investigator and the laboratory supervisor with the level of safety climate. Academic department significantly influenced the relationship between: 1) trust and incident rate; and 2) safety climate and incident rate. However, academic department did not influence the relationship between: 1) trust <b>and</b> <b>non-compliances</b> events; <b>and</b> 2) safety climate <b>and</b> <b>non-compliances</b> events. Laboratory type significantly influenced the relationship between trust <b>and</b> <b>non-compliance</b> events, but not between trust and incident rates. Finally, there was no relationship between academic department and laboratory when looking at employee perceptions of trust and safety climate. In conclusion, academic departments and laboratory leadership (both the principal investigator and laboratory supervisor) have significant impact on both employee perceptions of trust and safety climate. Effective traditional safety initiatives (e. g., safety training and compliance) are critical components of university safety programs. However, to achieve excellence in safety performance, university leaders and safety professionals must also focus on increasing trust between workers and laboratory leadership and on improving safety climate in academic research laboratories...|$|R

Economic instruments build on repetition and use utility transfers, economic sanctions and flexible treaty adjustments. Important legal instruments are reciprocal obligations and cooperation duties, international funding and transfer rules, treaty suspension, retorsions and reprisals, treaty revision, and monitoring.
