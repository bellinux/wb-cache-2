40|$|Whereas many <b>differential</b> <b>leukocyte</b> <b>count</b> {{methods for}} high somatic cell count (SCC) milk from mastitic cows are available, {{only a few}} have been {{developed}} for low SCC milk. We have developed a flow cytometric <b>differential</b> <b>leukocyte</b> <b>count</b> method for low SCC milk. The procedure consists of 1) 1. 5 ml of diluted milk sample (30 %, vol/vol dilution with PBS), 2) centrifugation, 3) leukocyte labeling with SYTO 13 and 4) flow cytometric analysis. Four major leukocyte populations can be clearly identified in the green fluorescence-side scatter dot plot: lymphocytes and monocytes (LM), polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), mature macrophages (MO), and cells with apoptotic features based on chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation. The optimal processing temperature was 20 degreesC. Significant differences among samples with similar differential leukocyte counts were found. Storage of milk samples during 2 d at 7 degreesC had no effect on <b>differential</b> <b>leukocyte</b> <b>count.</b> Using the new method, <b>differential</b> <b>leukocyte</b> <b>count</b> was performed in low SCC milk samples from cows in early, mid, and late lactation. In accordance with previous studies, PMN and M P percentages were lower and LM percentages were higher in early lactation than in the other stages of lactation. The percentage of cells with apoptotic features was higher in early lactation than in mid and late lactation.

In this study we assess the accuracy of capillary blood counts and evaluate the potential of a miniaturized cytometer developed for POC testing. <b>Differential</b> <b>leukocyte</b> <b>counts</b> in the normal clinical range from fingerprick (capillary) and venous blood samples were measured and compared using a standard hematology analyzer. The accuracy of our novel microfluidic impedance cytometer (MIC) was then tested by comparing same-site measurements to those obtained with the standard analyzer. The concordance between measurements of fingerprick and venous blood samples using the standard hematology analyzer was high, with no clinically relevant differences observed between the mean <b>differential</b> <b>leukocyte</b> <b>counts.</b> Concordance data between the MIC and the standard analyzer on same-site measurements presented significantly lower <b>leukocyte</b> <b>counts</b> determined by the MIC.

The method entailed diluting blood with phosphate-buffered, hypotonic saline solution containing acridine orange, and performing a step-wise, 3 -parameter analysis on the bases of cell size, cellular granularity, and granulocyte fluorescence. Initially, proportions of monocytes, granulocytes, and lymphocytes were determined by creating appropriate windows on dot plots of cell size (determined by forward light scatter) vs cellular granularity (determined by the logarithm of side light scatter). Eosinophils were resolved by analysis of granulocytes as dot plots of logarithms of green vs red fluorescence ascribed to acridine orange. Proportions of eosinophils and neutrophils were computed from data so generated. Microclumps of platelets spuriously affected counts of some granulocytes, particularly eosinophils. <b>Differential</b> <b>leukocyte</b> <b>counts</b> determined by flow cytometry generally compared favorably with those obtained by use of the conventional microscopic method, using Wright-stained blood films.

Concentration of each cytokine was detected by aÂ sandwich ELISA using commercially available kits. At 1 day after stimulation of mammary gland by LPS and PBS an average number of leukocytes, which was statistically significantly higher in the case of stimulation by LPS (P < 0. 01), was detected. After 7 days there was aÂ significant decrease in the total number of leukocytes. There has also been aÂ shift in the <b>differential</b> <b>leukocyte</b> <b>count.</b> Most abundant cell type were neutrophils, whose number was higher in the case of stimulation by LPS.

40|$|Dysferlinopathies include Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy type 2 B and Miyoshi Myopathy, which exhibit an {{autosomal}} recessive inheritance {{pattern of the}} dysferlin gene and characteristic inflammatory infiltrate in muscle. A study of prospective treatment options was conducted on SJL/J mice, a natural model for dysferlinopathy. The animals are immunocompetent but have elevated levels of circulating T-cells. A baseline termination of SJL/J mice was made at 14 weeks, and <b>differential</b> <b>leukocyte</b> <b>counts</b> determined for these animals through microscopy. After administration of resveratrol and Coenzyme Q 10 exclusively and in combination to the four treatment groups for approximately three months, the remaining six groups (negative and positive controls as well as four treatment groups) were terminated and <b>differential</b> <b>leukocyte</b> <b>counts</b> once again determined. Eosinophil counts were significantly higher in the baseline termination group than all other experimental groups assessed except for the negative control SWR/J mice, possessing normal muscle and used in research as a general purpose strain. Eosinophil granules are suggested to reduce inflammation caused by other leukocytes. At onset of dysferlinopathy between four and six weeks of age, the increase in eosinophil counts could very likely be a compensation mechanism to decrease initial inflammation in the muscular tissues of the dysferlinopathic mice. Neutrophil counts of the baseline termination group were significantly higher only {{when compared to the}} resveratrol/Coenzyme Q 10 combination group. Neutrophils are linked to early inflammatory responses and often sensitised in self-antigen recognition characteristic of autoimmune disease, a known complication in the SJL strain. Thus the higher neutrophil count in the six week old mice is probably related to inflammation at disease onset, but may also be indicative of autoimmunity; whereas the eosinophil counts may possibly play a more definitive role in the pathogenesis of dysferlinopathy. Further morphological studies will serve to clarify the roles of these leukocytes in dysferlinopathy. [URL]...|$|R

Leukocyte count results were available in all of the patients, ESR in 41, and CRP in 36. Results. Leukocyte count was normal in 6 patients (9. 8 %). Lymphocytic leukocytosis was seen in 1 patients (1. 6 %), neutrophilic leukocytosis in 25 (41. 0 %), and relative neutrophilia in 29 (47. 5 %). Thirty patients (73. 2 %) had a high ESR and 23 (63. 9 %) had a positive CRP. In children with a high ESR, 12 (29. 3 %) had neutrophilic leukocytosis and 14 (34. 1 %) had relative neutrophilia. Relative neutrophilia and neutrophilic leukocytosis with positive CRP both were found in 11 patients (30. 6 %). Negative CRP with absence of neutrophilic leukocytosis was found in a significantly higher proportion of patients. There were no direct correlations between the severity of systemic inflammatory responses and urinary tract inflammatory response. Conclusions. Findings of this study showed that ESR and <b>differential</b> <b>leukocyte</b> <b>count</b> are two valuable tests in febrile UTI and may be useful for localization of UTI level, but the total leukocyte count and CRP level as in qualitative methods are not useful, and many patients with febrile UTI do not have leukocytosis. </p...|$|E
30|$|In {{comparison}} to other captive murids, the captive Australian native tree-rats and stick-nest rats presented {{differences in their}} leukocyte morphology, haematology and serum biochemistry. The haematology and serum biochemistry values were relatively consistent between individuals, despite the use of different analysis equipment and regardless of some differences in collection methods between individuals. WBC counts were higher in females in both species. Both species also had high N:L ratios (tree-rat ratios were almost even). HCT was higher in male stick-nest rats than females. <b>Differential</b> <b>leukocyte</b> <b>counts</b> and <b>leukocyte</b> morphology was consistent with previous descriptions in other murids and between individuals. Blood biochemistry values were unremarkable except for {{the high level of}} globulin in stick-nest rats when compared to previous murid research (Bradley et al. 1988; Kemper et al. 1987; Monamy 1995; Old et al. 2005, 2007; Thrall et al. 2012).|$|R
40|$|Mercury {{toxicity}} in tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, (Linnaeus, 1758) {{was investigated}} by the hematological parameters after long-term (14 days) exposure to various Hg concentrations (0. 02, 0. 002, 0. 0002 mg/L Hg). Test groups were set up with three replicates for each concentration, plus the control group. Blood samples were collected from six individuals for each concentration at 0, 3, 7, 10 and 14 days of exposure. The hematological parameters analyzed were: total {{red blood cell count}} (RBC), hemoglobin concentration (Hb), hematocrit (Ht), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), total white blood cell <b>count</b> (WBC) and <b>differential</b> <b>leukocyte</b> <b>counts</b> and total thrombocyte count (Tr). There were no significant differences among the mean hematological values at the different Hg concentrations indicating that Hg at the concentrations studied was not toxic to tilapia...|$|R
40|$|Hematological {{results are}} {{reported}} for 13 giant anteaters (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) and 13 collared anteaters (Tamandua tetradactyla). Animals were captive-reared adults {{held at the}} FundaÃ§Ã£o Parque ZoolÃ³gico de SÃ£o Paulo (SÃ£o Paulo, SP, Brazil) and Parque ZoolÃ³gico Municipal Quinzinho de Barros (Sorocaba, SP, Brazil), and were considered healthy on physical examination. Examined parameters included red blood cell count, white blood cell count, hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, total plasmatic protein and <b>differential</b> <b>leukocyte</b> <b>counts.</b> Also, a survey for hemoparasites was done and none was observed in thin blood smears. The results were generally similar to those previously reported in the exiguous literature for these species, providing further reference data for the interpretation of laboratory results besides health monitoring, assisting early disease diagnosis and providing relevant information for conservation programs for these species...|$|R
