5000|$|For the 1952 model year, Pontiac {{discontinued}} the Streamliner {{leaving the}} Chieftain as their only offering. The Chieftain continued with the 120 inch wheelbase. Engine offerings were {{basically the same}} except for the 8-cylinder which got a [...]2 cubic inch enlargement. Horsepower did increase by 10 on the 6-cylinder and by 15 on the 8-cylinder. Also, a red light to remind the driver that the parking brake was on was new. In the May 1952 issue of Popular Mechanics, the Chieftain was rated 14.9 seconds for a 0-60 mph time.

50|$|The K10/K11 {{generations of}} Micra were known for reliability, {{excellent}} build quality, and user friendliness. The K12 model has received consistently good reviews, {{with the main}} criticisms being the lack of <b>head</b> <b>room</b> and luggage space in the rear.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} GRP sailing {{boats were}} first built in 1980. They {{were designed to}} be an affordable cruiser that had good stable sailing capability, good interior <b>head</b> <b>room</b> and would sleep four people in relative comfort for 'weekend' cruising.|$|R

50|$|The styling of the Windsor {{was more}} rounded and {{featured}} wrap around windshields. The word DeLuxe {{was added to}} Windsor again. Front <b>head</b> <b>room</b> was 35 in. Rear axle ratio for the 3-speed manual was 3.73. The Windsor made up 64.72% of Chrysler'ss sales.|$|R
50|$|Roller screens are {{preferred}} to trommel screens when the feed rate required is high. They also cause less noise than trommel screens and require less <b>head</b> <b>room.</b> Viscous and sticky materials {{are easier to}} be separated using a roller screen than with a trommel screen.|$|R
40|$|Educational {{institutions}} established {{containing a}} moral and social responsibility of the government, students, {{the community and the}} stakeholders. That responsibility implies that education held should give priority to quality education in order to achieve a good quality of graduates according to expectations of all stakeholders. To identify the needs of the competencies of graduates, Tracer study provides information about the needs of the market and the relevance between education and employment outcomes of graduates. Tracer study results will provide clear direction on planning education to have appropriate quality expectations of stakeholders. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the quality graduates assessment of third diploma of Nursing Akes Rajekwesi Bojonegoro through tracer studies in the scope of Bojonegoro hospital in 2012. The research is descriptive with survey approach. The population is the entire <b>head</b> <b>room</b> of Hospital in Bojonegoro in 2012 with a sample size of 35 <b>head</b> <b>room</b> of hospital in Bojonegoro. The variable research was quality of graduates that includes cognitive, affective, and psychomotor assesment. The research instrument was a questionnaire given to the <b>head</b> <b>room</b> of the hospital to assess the quality of graduates who have worked in the hospital and still an apprentice. Data was processed and tabulated by scoring and presented by procentage tabular. The results showed that the assessment of the quality of Nursing graduates of third diploma Akes Rajekwesi Bojonegoro that have already employed by the <b>head</b> <b>room</b> of hospital was a good majority (82. 9 %) while the alumni who carry out an internship in good category (44. 8 %) and sufficient (48. 3 %). Based on the research results, it is necessary the participation of Internal quality assurance of institution, lecturer, and a whole range of leaders to commit in order to improve the quality of graduates...|$|R

50|$|The {{construction}} of the mineral jig results in maximum utilization of floor area and minimum <b>head</b> <b>room</b> requirements, permitting greater capacity per unit of operating floor area than, for example, shaking tables or other devices.

50|$|The next Johnson {{class was}} an 0-6-0 goods engine (Class 417) {{introduced}} in 1867 and 1868 and numbering 60 engines.

50|$|For 1957, Chrysler cars, {{including}} the Windsor, were restyled again. This time with taller tailfins with vertical taillights, thinner C-pillars, and a wraparound front bumper. Mid-year, dual headlights became standard. Front <b>head</b> <b>room</b> grew to 35.7 inches. Safety equipment was optional on the Windsor. Unfortunately for Chrysler, 1957 cars were plagued with quality problems, such as breaking torsion bar suspensions and rust.|$|R
50|$|Efforts to {{increase}} the DA40's cruising speed centered on the propeller and wheel spats. The wheel fairing streamlining was improved, a three-blade scimitar-type constant speed propeller was incorporated and the Powerflow exhaust system from the XL was retained. The canopy contour was also revised, with the sides being more vertical before curving into the roof, which provides more shoulder and <b>head</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R

25|$|Externally, the {{differences}} between the Mark A and Mark B Minicar were very subtle. The rear mudguards were slightly smaller but wider to accommodate the wheel movement whilst the storage area behind the rear seats was also enlarged, increasing the cars overall length slightly and changing its rear profile. Beneath the bodywork, there were improvements to the electrics and to the braking system. The hood was also redesigned to provide more <b>head</b> <b>room</b> inside the car.|$|R
