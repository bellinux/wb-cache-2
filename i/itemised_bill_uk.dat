50|$|Reverse SMS billing or premium SMS service {{means that}} the user of the {{recipient}} phone rather than the message sender is charged {{for the cost of}} the SMS message received. It is also called MT (Mobile Terminated) Billing. Reverse-billed SMS messages are only sent if specifically requested by the phone user; however, many unscrupulous operators will send reverse-charged messages without prior consent of the recipient, which often go un-noticed by users on Pay As You Go plans without <b>itemised</b> <b>billing.</b> The consent may also be hidden in the fine print of an advertisement. A daily weather alert {{is an example of a}} service where regular reverse-billed messages are received.|$|R

I am disinclined to make excavations into the insides of a personal affection. I am glued to {{the theory that the}} diversions and discrepancies of the indisposition known as love should be as private a sentiment as a toothbrush. 'Tis my opinion that the biographies of the heart should be confined with the historical romances of the liver to the advertising pages of the magazines.

40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to make a {{contribution}} to current debates about the reform of higher education by using the work of Ronald Coase on 'the nature of the firm' as a framework for considering alternative institutional structures for delivering educational services. Attention is focused particularly on rival ways of coordinating the delivery of educational services and guaranteeing standards. Extreme market-based scenarios involving freelance academics and <b>itemised</b> <b>billing</b> for specific services are contrasted with the present system involving very incomplete contracts for academic employees and 'banquet-style' purchases of degrees by students. Costs and benefits of different institutional structures are examined. The role of academic professionalism in limiting opportunistic behaviour is considered in relation to policies that involve an increase in auditing of tertiary institutions...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} 1 we propose a novel {{architecture}} for {{value added services}} provision in UMTS networks. The key idea is to introduce a model, which is capable of handling efficiently subscription management, as well as charging, billing and accounting for value added services that are provided either by the network provider or third trusted parties. We propose a flexible business model inline with the arising requirements for openness and dynamic subscription and introduce an integrated system that employs a flexible charging scheme {{for each type of}} service usage (transport and value added), so that the user will receive only one <b>itemised</b> <b>bill</b> for all services. As a result, the user is able to access a large number of services provided by independent providers, without the need for any additional contracts...|$|R

5000|$|Collect/Reverse Charge calling Various schemes were {{devised to}} allow large organisations to {{automatically}} accept collect calls, where the recipient pays long-distance charges for any {{call from a}} predefined area. A Zenith number in the late 1950s required an operator manually determine the destination number from a printed list; the 1967 Wide Area Telephone Service introduced the first automated toll-free telephone numbers, terminated on special fixed-rate trunks. By the 1980s, computerisation of the system allowed British Telecom [...] "Linkline" [...] 0800 freephone numbers and AT&T +1-800- toll-free numbers {{to be controlled by}} a database and terminated virtually anywhere with each inbound call <b>itemised</b> and <b>billed</b> individually. This smart network was further refined to provide toll-free number portability in the 1990s.|$|R
