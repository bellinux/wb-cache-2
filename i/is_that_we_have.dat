The problem we are faced with now, he claims, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a bureaucratic system of distribution that provides lower quality service and prohibits the involvement of civil society in the provision of public services. The alternative he lays out is to have the state act to equip civil society to partake in public services and care. This would entail empowering each individual to have two responsibilities, one in the productive economy and one in the caring economy.|$|E
25|$|Again {{there are}} {{technical}} {{issues relating to}} spin, but in several important cases, including electrically charged particles and particles interacting via nuclear forces, {{the solution to the}} problem is to impute physical reality to the gauge function θ(x). We say that if the function θ oscillates, it represents a new type of quantum-mechanical wave, and this new wave has its own momentum pnbsp&=nbsp&h/λ, which turns out to patch up the discrepancies that otherwise would have broken conservation of momentum. In the context of electromagnetism, the particles A and B would be charged particles such as electrons, and the quantum mechanical wave represented by θ would be the electromagnetic field. (Here we ignore the technical issues raised by the fact that electrons actually have spin 1/2, not spin zero. This oversimplification is the reason that the gauge field θ comes out to be a scalar, whereas the electromagnetic field is actually represented by a vector consisting of V and A.) The result <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> an explanation for the presence of electromagnetic interactions: if we try to construct a gauge-symmetric theory of identical, non-interacting particles, the result is not self-consistent, and can only be repaired by adding electric and magnetic fields that cause the particles to interact.|$|E

The U.S. responded by ending {{diplomatic}} relations, and it increased CIA funding for exiled dissidents; these militants began attacking ships that traded with Cuba, and bombed factories, shops, and sugar mills. Both Eisenhower and his successor John F. Kennedy supported a CIA plan to aid a dissident militia, the Democratic Revolutionary Front, to invade Cuba and overthrow Castro; the plan resulted in the Bay of Pigs Invasion in April 1961. On April 15, CIA-supplied B-26's bombed 3 Cuban military airfields; the U.S. announced that the perpetrators were defecting Cuban air force pilots, but Castro exposed these claims as false flag misinformation.

500|$|The {{fact that}} Tucker goes free upholds {{a common theme}} in Homicide: Life on the Street – that life is not always fair, and that criminals {{sometimes}} get away with their crimes, a conviction that often put the show's producers at odds with NBC executives. Fontana deliberately wrote the script {{so that it would}} remain ambiguous whether Tucker committed the murder or not. He wanted the character to have a genuine feeling of love for Adena Watson, but the strong feelings do not specifically mean he killed the girl. Braugher praised Fontana for creating such a three-dimensional character in Tucker, and said, [...] "Fontana's genius is that we are never quite certain as to what it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> on our hands." [...] Fontana also wanted Pembleton and Bayliss to have different interpretations of the same interrogation; Bayliss begins the interview convinced of the man's guilt and becomes uncertain by the end, and Pembleton has the opposite experience. Multiple police departments have requested copies of [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] for use in training sessions due to its accurate portrayal of the intricacies of the police interrogation process.

The strikers were represented by the Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee, which was demanding that the workers it represented be given better rights, including better rights to strike. On 26 August meeting with representatives of the strikers at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk, Jagielski promised that the right to strike would be added to a new law on the official trade unions of Poland. After 5 more days of difficult negotiations, a settlement was reached between the strikers and the government, known as the Gdańsk agreement. Norman Davies contends that Jagielski [...] "in the end realised that only two alternatives remained -either agreement on the strikers' terms or an immediate resort to force for which the government was not prepared." [...] The agreement, as well as giving the workers of the Lenin Shipyard the right to strike, also allowed them to form their own independent trade union.

Denver won its first game, but proceeded to lose nine {{in a row and}} finish with a 3–11 record. The team improved only marginally in the ensuing years, posting losing records in 1968 and 1969. The AFL and National Football League merged beginning in 1970, but the Broncos continued to lose, posting a record of 5–8–1 in 1970. Saban resigned after the Broncos got off to a 2–6–1 start in 1971.

Casey also justified this request by stating that the contact in the Iranian government might otherwise lose face or be executed, and hostages might be killed. Reagan authorized the shipment to ensure that those potential events would not occur. North used this release to persuade Reagan to switch over to a [...] "sequential" [...] policy of freeing the hostages one by one, instead of the [...] "all or nothing" [...] policy that the Americans had pursued until then. By this point, the Americans had grown tired of Ghobanifar who had proven himself a dishonest intermediary who played off both sides to his own commercial advantage. In August 1986, the Americans had established a new contact in the Iranian government, Ali Hashemi Bahramani, the nephew of Rafsanjani and an officer in the Revolutionary Guard. The fact that the Revolutionary Guard was deeply involved in international terrorism seemed only to attract the Americans more to Bahramani, who was seen as someone with the influence to change Iran's policies. Richard Secord, an American arms dealer who was being used as a contract with Iran wrote to North: [...] "My judgement <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> opened up a new and probably better channel into Iran".
