5|$|Brady and Hindley {{visited a}} {{fairground}} on 26 December 1964, {{in search of}} another victim, and noticed 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey standing beside one of the rides. When {{it became apparent that}} she was on her own, they approached her and deliberately dropped some of the shopping they were carrying close to her, before asking for the girl's help to carry some of the packages to their car, and then to their home. Once inside the house Downey was undressed, gagged and forced to pose for photographs before being raped and killed, perhaps strangled with a piece of string. Hindley maintained that she went to fill a bath for the child and found the girl dead (presumably killed by Brady) when she returned. In Chris Cowley's book Face to Face with Evil: Conversations with Ian Brady, Brady states that it was Hindley who killed Downey. The following morning Brady and Hindley drove with Downey's body to Saddleworth Moor, where she was buried, naked with her clothes at <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>in</b> a shallow grave.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, Hingis was {{sponsored}} by Sergio Tacchini. She sued the company in 2001, demanding $40 million for making allegedly defective shoes that injured <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> <b>In</b> 1998 already she suffered a foot injury, and she withdrew from the Wimbledon doubles competition in 1999; Hingis alleged that a Tacchini-appointed specialist recommended her shoes be changed, a recommendation which was ignored by the company, which had fired her as spokeswoman in April 1999 due to an alleged breach of contract. She was then sponsored by Adidas from 1999 until 2008.|$|E
25|$|The Princess's {{later life}} {{was marred by}} illness and disability. She had smoked {{cigarettes}} {{since at least the}} age of 15 and had continued to smoke heavily for many years. On 5 January 1985, she had part of her left lung removed; the operation drew parallels with that of her father over 30 years earlier. In 1991, she quit smoking, though she continued to drink heavily. In January 1993, she was admitted to hospital for pneumonia. She experienced a mild stroke in 1998 at her holiday home in Mustique. Early the following year the Princess suffered severe scalds to <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> a bathroom accident, which affected her mobility to the extent that she required support when walking and sometimes used a wheelchair. In January and March 2001, further strokes were diagnosed, which left her with partial vision and paralysis on the left side. Margaret's last public appearances were at the 101st birthday celebrations of her mother in August 2001 and the 100th birthday celebration of her aunt, Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester, that December.|$|E

500|$|As {{a last-ditch}} effort to salvage the day, Michael assembles a [...] "Tribal Council" [...] {{stand-up}} comedy competition. Jim declines to participate, and reveals that he has applied for the position in New York. Separated from the group, a barefoot Pam runs across the hot coals and, feeling {{a new sense of}} confidence because of the experience, interrupts the Tribal Council to berate her colleagues for treating her poorly, citing the fact that almost no one attended her art show. She rounds on Jim, and tells him that she called off her wedding because of him, that it is [...] "fine" [...] that he is with someone else now, but that she misses the fun that they had as best friends before he transferred. As she runs to cool <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> the water, the cameraman turns to Jim who is now in a blank stare, shaken by the confession.|$|E
500|$|The Princess was buried, her son at <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>in</b> St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, on 19 November 1817. [...] A {{monument}} was erected, {{by public}} subscription, at her tomb. [...] It {{was not long}} before the public began to pin blame for the tragedy. [...] The Queen and the Prince Regent were blamed for not being present at the birth, though Charlotte had specifically requested that they stay away. [...] Although the postmortem was inconclusive, many blamed Croft for his care of the Princess. [...] The Prince Regent refused to blame Croft; nevertheless, three months after Charlotte's death and while attending another young woman, Croft snatched up a gun and fatally shot himself. [...] The [...] "triple obstetric tragedy"—death of child, mother, and practitioner—led to significant changes in obstetric practice, with obstetricians who favoured intervention in protracted labour, including in particular more liberal use of forceps, gaining ground over those who did not.|$|E
2500|$|The {{depiction}} in the 12th-century English Eadwine Psalter has a naked female swimmer in the water, {{holding the}} empty ark with one hand, while a clothed female with <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> the water {{holds out the}} baby to the princess, who reclines on a bed or litter. [...] This is part of some 11 scenes {{of the life of}} Moses. [...] This may relate to the Jewish visual traditions covered below.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not opened yet,' said Mr Chester. 'Dear me! I {{hope the}} aged soul has not caught <b>her</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> some unlucky cobweb by the way. She is there at last! Come in, I beg!' ...|$|R

6000|$|The old hare {{stiffened}} {{her long}} grey ears, and stamped <b>her</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> the snow. [...] "You mustn't die here," [...] she said. [...] "No Mulgar has ever died here. This forest belongs to me." ...|$|R
2500|$|An annual poll of film exhibitors listed MacDonald {{as one of}} the top-10 box-office draws of 1936, {{and many}} of her films were among the top-20 moneymakers of the years they were released. In addition, MacDonald w{{as one of the}} top-10 box-office attractions in Great Britain from 1937 to 1942 inclusive. [...] During her 39-year career, MacDonald earned two stars in the Hollywood Walk of Fame (for films and recordings) and planted <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> the wet {{concrete}} in front of Grauman's Chinese Theater.|$|E
2500|$|Christie {{describes}} what happens then: [...] "Inspector Kelsey was quick {{and so was}} Adam, {{but they were not}} quick enough. Ann Shapland had sprung to <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> <b>In</b> her hand was a small wicked-looking automatic and it pointed straight at Mrs Upjohn. Miss Bulstrode, quicker than the two men, moved sharply forward, but swifter still was Miss Chadwick. It was not Mrs Upjohn that she was trying to shield, it was the woman who was standing between Ann Shapland and Mrs Upjohn." [...] Chadwick is fatally wounded.|$|E
2500|$|The {{general view}} is that the {{practice}} is likely to have originated from the time of Emperor Li Yu (Southern Tang of the Ten Kingdoms, just before the Song dynasty). Emperor Li Yu created a six-foot tall golden lotus decorated with precious stones and pearls, and asked his concubine [...] to bind <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> white silk into the shape of the crescent moon, and performed a ballet-like dance on the points of her feet on the lotus. Yao Niang's dance was said to be so graceful that others sought to imitate her. The binding of feet was then replicated by other upper-class women and the practice spread.|$|E
25|$|In 2009 {{during a}} free-diving {{competition}} {{in a tank}} of icy water in Harbin, China, a captive beluga brought a cramp-paralyzed diver {{from the bottom of}} the pool up to the surface by holding <b>her</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> its mouth, saving the diver's life.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Carmen won't {{last more}} than a couple of days.' Mason spat out a chunk of ice and {{surveyed}} the poor animal ruefully, then put <b>her</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> his mouth and proceeded to bite out the ice which clustered cruelly between the toes.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Leave it to me,' {{said the}} frog, 'I will manage it for you.' And, uttering a strange noise, she struck the ground thrice with <b>her</b> <b>foot.</b> <b>In</b> an instant six {{thousand}} frogs appeared before her, {{one of them}} bearing a little cap.|$|R
2500|$|In 1858, Bernadette Soubirous {{reported}} {{a vision of}} Our Lady of Lourdes. A simple 14-year-old peasant girl of no significant educational experience, Soubirous claimed she saw uo petito damizelo, [...] "a small maiden," [...] in white, with a golden rosary and blue belt fastened around her waist, and two golden roses at <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> <b>In</b> subsequent visitations she heard the lady speak to her, saying Que soy era Immaculada Concepciou (I am the Immaculate Conception), and asking that a chapel be built there. At first ridiculed, questioned, and belittled by Church officials and other contemporaries, Soubirous insisted on her vision. Eventually the Church believed {{her and she was}} canonized by Pope Pius XI in 1933.|$|E
2500|$|As {{everyone}} {{is leaving the}} room, Violetta has asked Alfredo to see her. Fearing that the Baron's anger will lead him to challenge Alfredo to a duel, she gently asks Alfredo to leave. Alfredo misunderstands her apprehension and demands that she admit that she loves the Baron. In grief, she makes that admission and, furiously, Alfredo calls the guests to witness {{what he has to}} say (Questa donna conoscete? – [...] "You know this woman?"). He humiliates and denounces Violetta in front of the guests and then throws his winnings at <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> payment for her services. She faints onto the floor. The guests reprimand Alfredo: Di donne ignobile insultatore, di qua allontanati, ne desti orror! ("Ignoble insulter of women, go away from here, you fill us with horror!").|$|E
2500|$|Although her {{difficulties}} with the English language persisted, {{as time went}} on, the once rigidly formal Portuguese Infanta mellowed and began to enjoy {{some of the more}} innocent pleasures of the court. She loved to play cards and shocked devout Protestants by playing on Sundays. She enjoyed dancing and took great delight in organising masques. She had a great love for the countryside and picnics; fishing and archery were also favourite pastimes. In a far cry from her convent-days the newly liberated Catherine displayed a fondness for the recent trend of court ladies wearing men's clothing, which we are told, [...] "showed off her pretty, neat legs and ankles"; and she was even reported to have considered leading the way in wearing shorter dresses, which would show off <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> <b>In</b> 1670, on a trip to Audley End with her ladies-in-waiting, the once chronically shy Catherine attended a country fair disguised as a village maiden, but was soon discovered and, due to the large crowds, forced to make a hasty retreat. And when in 1664 her favourite painter, Jacob Huysmans, a Flemish Catholic, painted her as St Catherine, it promptly set a trend among court ladies.|$|E
60|$|One {{evening in}} coming up some steps Princess Anne {{entangled}} <b>her</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> pink taffetas petticoat, nearly fell, and tore a large rent, besides breaking {{the thread of}} the festoons of seed pearls which bordered it, and scattering them on the floor.|$|R
5000|$|Katharine McPhee {{performed}} <b>in</b> bare <b>feet</b> {{after she}} fractured <b>her</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> Charlotte, North Carolina (not in slipper-sandals or gardening slippers that had widely been reported), and performed barefoot {{for the rest}} of the tour. She wore a cast on <b>her</b> left <b>foot</b> after the accident until August 22 in St. Paul, Minnesota.|$|R
50|$|Later that year, Cooke {{qualified}} for the 2016 World Football Freestyle Championships in Melbourne. She finished second, making her the youngest ever finalist. Cooke broke <b>her</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> the final, which ruled her out for several months. She returned to training in April 2017.|$|R
2500|$|In the {{vaulting}} events, gymnasts sprint down a [...] runway, jump onto {{a springboard}} (or perform a roundoff or handspring entry onto a springboard), land momentarily inverted on the {{hands on the}} vaulting horse or vaulting table (pre-flight segment), then propel themselves forward or backward off that platform to a two-footed landing (post-flight segment). Every gymnast starts at a different point on the vault runway depending on their height and strength. The post-flight segment may include one or more multiple saltos, somersaults, or twisting movements. A round-off entry vault, called a Yurchenko, {{is the most common}} vault in the higher levels in gymnastics. When performing a Yurchenko, gymnasts [...] "round off" [...] so their hands are on the runway while their feet land on the springboard. From the roundoff position, the gymnast travels backwards and executes a back handspring so that the hands land on the vaulting table. The gymnast then blocks off the vaulting platform into various twisting and/or somersaulting combinations. The post-flight segment brings the gymnast to <b>her</b> <b>feet.</b> <b>In</b> the lower levels of gymnastics, the gymnasts do not perform this move. These gymnasts will jump onto the springboard with both feet {{at the same time and}} either do a front handspring onto the vault or a roundoff onto the vault.|$|E
2500|$|Art is an {{approximately}} 9-foot tall (274.32cm) {{statue of}} a young female figure wearing a floor-length tunic underneath an intricately tied outer garment, which is pinned at her proper left shoulder with a fibula. The outer garment is belted at the sculpture's upper and lower waist and is approximately two inches shorter than the tunic. The skirts of both the tunic and outer garment fall towards {{the floor in a}} multitude of folds. It is crossed diagonally over her shoulder blades and loosely gathered on her proper right chest, exposing her neck and breastbone. The statue's hair is parted in the middle and pulled back from her face into a twisted bun, and a crown of laurel leaves is nestled atop her head. Her gaze is directed forwards and her features are idealized, like the other female figures of the sculpture group with the exception of Justice. In her proper left hand, she carries a round palette held down at her side, and in her proper right hand, a paintbrush held in front of her at waist height. She stands with her weight on both feet, with her proper right foot extended slightly forward of her proper left. There are several dots of an unknown black substance on the marble base underneath <b>her</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>in</b> front of her proper left foot. There is no discernible foundry mark or signature, but the statue is identified by the black label attached to the cement pedestal underneath her feet, which reads [...] "ART" [...] in gold lettering.|$|E
60|$|At these quite {{innocent}} remarks she {{sprang to}} <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> a rage that might truly be called royal in every sense.|$|E
60|$|Filled fuller than ever, {{with this}} great idea, Mr. Bounderby {{came in to}} lunch, and sat himself down in the dining-room of former days, where his {{portrait}} was. Mrs. Sparsit sat by the fire, with <b>her</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> cotton stirrup, little thinking whither she was posting.|$|R
50|$|After leaving Play, Faye {{returned}} {{to college and}} modeling, attending the music school Rytmus and signing with Swedish modeling agency Synkcasting. Faye appeared in several photo shoots and runway shows. She also kept <b>her</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> the music business, releasing occasional singles through modeling campaigns and providing background vocals.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bad Fortune!" [...] cries The Vengeance, {{stamping}} <b>her</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> the chair, [...] "and {{here are}} the tumbrils! And Evremonde will be despatched in a wink, and she not here! See her knitting in my hand, and her empty chair ready for her. I cry with vexation and disappointment!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It {{has always}} been an amazing old world, Beth," [...] said another girl who was sitting on the porch railing and {{swinging}} <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> the air.|$|E
6000|$|... "But how can I?" [...] {{she burst}} out. [...] "Here I have been saying, or writing, that--that you might love me, or {{something}} of the sort!--just out of charity--and all the time--oh, it is perfectly damnable how things are!" [...] she said, stamping <b>her</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> a nervous quiver.|$|R
5000|$|Zielke {{was signed}} as a {{priority}} access player by [...] in August 2016, ahead of the inaugural AFL Women's season in 2017. She completed a reduced pre-season ahead of 2017, after breaking <b>her</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> September 2016. Zielke was named the club's inaugural AFL Women's captain in January 2017.|$|R
60|$|So another donkey was procured, {{this time}} with a man's saddle, and putting <b>her</b> <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> the stirrup, she cocked her leg over and took her seat triumphantly. Neither modesty nor bashfulness was to be {{reckoned}} among Liza's faults, and in this position she felt quite at ease.|$|R
