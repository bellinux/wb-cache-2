40|$|A {{new design}} is {{presented}} for a superconducting-coil-based compact cyclotron, which has many practical benefits over conventional superconducting cyclotrons. Unlike in conventional superconducting cyclotrons, an iron yoke and poles {{have been avoided}} in this design and the azimuthally varying field is generated by superconducting sector coils. Housing the superconducting sector coils and circular coils in a single cryostat has resulted in an ultralight 25  MeV proton cyclotron weighing about 2000  kg. Further, the sector coils and the main coils are fed by independent power supplies, which allow flexibility of operation through on-line magnetic <b>field</b> <b>trimming.</b> The engineering considerations, focused on making the cyclotron ideally suited to medical applications, are described in detail...|$|E
40|$|A superconducting ring {{cyclotron}} {{proposed as}} a booster {{of the existing}} RIKEN Ring Cyclotron (RRC), is composed of six superconducting sector magnets. In each sector mag-net, the pole pieces are placed at 4 K {{to be used as}} a sup-port structure of the coil vessel against large electromag-netic forces and also to enhance magnetic flux efficiently. The <b>field</b> <b>trimming</b> system suitable for such a cyclotron is thought to be a combination of superconducting and nor-mal trim coils. Considering their differing properties, opti-mization of a trimming system has been carried out using numerical methods. The trimming system is required to isochronize the magnetic fields for various ions in a wide range of beam energy. Features of the trim coils and the results of optimization are described. ...|$|E

The Jets had lost their opener to the Baltimore Ravens the previous week. The Patriots droved 51 yards in seven-and-a-half minutes to the Jets 14, but after a false-start penalty, Gostkowski missed a 37-yard field goal. After a Jets three-and-out, the Patriots went on a 15 play, 75-yard marathon, taking over eight minutes off the clock, scoring on a 6-yard touchdown pass to Welker early in the second quarter. After accruing no passing yards during the first quarter, the Jets marched 73 yards in 12 plays, taking just under 7 minutes off the clock, scoring on a 10-yard touchdown pass from Mark Sanchez to Braylon Edwards. Two possessions later, after two incomplete passes, Brady hit Hernandez for a 46-yard catch-and-run, then hit Moss for a 34-yard touchdown pass on an incredible one-handed catch, beating the vaunted Darrelle Revis, re-taking a 14-7 lead. The Jets answered, marching to the Patriots 31, and Nick Folk was good on a 49-yard <b>field</b> goal, <b>trimming</b> the deficit to 14-10 at halftime. After a Jets punt, the Patriots drove to the Jets 47, but Antonio Cromartie intercepted his pass attempt for Moss at the 3.

The Jets cashed in after a Patriots three-and-out, racing 70 yards in 6 plays, scoring on a 2-yard touchdown pass to Jerricho Cotchery (with a successful 2-point conversion), taking a 21-14 lead. On the second play of the Patriots next drive, Cromartie intercepted another pass attempt for Moss at the Jets 41, but couldn't move the ball. After forcing the Patriots to punt, the Jets marched 63 yards in 8 plays, aided by a 23-yard pass interference penalty on Darius Butler, scoring on a 1-yard touchdown toss to Dustin Keller, widening the lead to 28-14 midway through the fourth quarter.
