40|$|What {{comes next}} after high {{political}} and governmental office in contemporary Western representative democracies? The role of <b>former</b> <b>leaders</b> is a neglected {{issue in the}} study of political leadership in representative democracies. There is no fixed or predetermined role-former leaders have to work it out for themselves, and what they do depends very much on personal choices and on circumstances. In the era of the career politician, the presidentialisation of leadership and the political celebrity, and with intensified and personalised media coverage of politics and leaders, it has become more difficult for <b>former</b> <b>leaders</b> to quietly retire and fade from the scene-even if they want to, and many do not. Individual agency {{is only part of the}} picture, however. Contextual factors play a crucial role. First of all there is the importance of the immediate political situation in terms of the circumstances of the <b>former</b> <b>leader's</b> exit from office, alongside the internal party dynamics and relations with the successor-leader. Second, institutional factors structure the opportunities and choices that <b>former</b> <b>leaders</b> face. Finally, the broader environment of modern politics, from the 1960 s and 1970 s onwards, has clearly opened up new opportunities and possibilities for <b>former</b> <b>leaders...</b>|$|R
5|$|With most Progressives having {{rejoined the}} Republican Party, their <b>former</b> <b>leader,</b> Theodore Roosevelt, was deemed {{likely to make}} a third run for the White House in 1920, and was the {{overwhelming}} favorite for the Republican nomination. These plans ended when Roosevelt suddenly died on January 6, 1919. A number of candidates quickly emerged, including General Leonard Wood, Illinois Governor Frank Lowden, California Senator Hiram Johnson, {{and a host of}} relatively minor possibilities such as Herbert Hoover (renowned for his World War I relief work), Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, and General John J.

5|$|Born in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Antonio {{initially}} {{worked as}} a car washer at a local police station with his brother Osiel Cárdenas Guillén, <b>former</b> <b>leader</b> of the cartel. By the late 1980s, he entered the drug trade, and later became the crime boss of Matamoros, where he controlled the city's drug trafficking shipments and all organized crime activities. Few details were known of Antonio's criminal career prior to 1999, when his brother Osiel confronted federal agents at gunpoint with several of his gunmen in Matamoros. In 1998, Antonio avoided arrest after FBI and DEA agents tracked his whereabouts inside a domicile in Houston. Back in Mexico, his brother Osiel was the Gulf Cartel's main leader and had created a paramilitary squad known as Los Zetas, formed by soldiers who left the Mexican military.|$|E

When the Arellano Félix took control of the organization in the early 1990s, tensions with the rival Sinaloa Cartel prompted violent attacks and slayings from both fronts.|$|E

5|$|Some {{historians are}} {{convinced}} that by 1964 Mikoyan believed that Khrushchev {{had turned into a}} liability to the Party, and that he was involved in the October 1964 coup that brought Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin to power. However, William Taubman disputes this, as Mikoyan was {{the only member of the}} Presidium (the name for the Politburo at this time) to defend Khrushchev. Mikoyan, however, did vote to force Khrushchev's retirement (so as, in traditional Soviet style, to make the vote unanimous). Alone among Khrushchev's colleagues, Mikoyan wished the <b>former</b> <b>leader</b> well in his retirement, though he never spoke to him again. Mikoyan laid a wreath and sent a letter of condolence at Khrushchev's funeral in 1971.|$|E
5|$|When Gillard {{replaced}} Rudd in 2010, Stephen Smith {{retained the}} portfolio of Foreign Affairs {{up until the}} 2010 election, when he was moved to Defence.

After Rudd's unsuccessful leadership challenge in February 2012, Gillard appointed Bob Carr to succeed Rudd as Foreign Affairs Minister. When Gillard was not present in the Australia due to international commitments, or in other circumstances, Wayne Swan assumed the title of acting prime minister; when neither leader nor deputy were present in Australia, Leader of the Government in the Senate Chris Evans assumed the role, as occurred in October and November 2012.|$|E
5|$|A new {{programme}} {{was initiated}} subsequently, called Joint European Transport (JET). This {{was set up}} in June 1977, and was based at the then British Aerospace (formerly Vickers) site in Weybridge, Surrey, UK. Although the members were all of Airbus' partners, they regarded the project as a separate collaboration from Airbus. This project was considered the forerunner of Airbus A320, encompassing the 130- to 188-seat market, powered by two CFM56s. It would have a cruise speed of Mach 0.84 (faster than Boeing 737). The programme was later transferred to Airbus, leading up {{to the creation of the}} Single-Aisle (SA) studies in 1980, led by <b>former</b> <b>leader</b> of JET programme, Derek Brown. The group looked at three different variants, covering the 125- to 180-seat market, called SA1, SA2 and SA3. Although unaware at the time, the consortium was producing the blueprints for the A319, A320 and A321, respectively. The single-aisle programme created divisions within Airbus about whether to design a shorter-range twinjet than a longer-range quadjet wanted by the West Germans, particularly Lufthansa. However, works proceeded, and the German carrier would eventually order the twinjet.|$|E

5|$|Having worked {{together}} for communist {{organizations in the}} mid-1980s, Faeq al-Mir and Elias Atallah boasted a close relationship {{at the time of}} the arrest. Al-Mir, a human rights activist, led the left-wing People’s Democratic Party, an unauthorized party critical of the Syrian government. Atallah was the leader and sole parliamentarian of the Democratic Left Movement, a leftist Lebanese party. He was also a senior figure in the March 14 Alliance, a Lebanese parliamentary coalition critical of Syrian policies. The two conversed over the phone several times prior to the arrest. They often lamented the assassinations of anti-Syrian Lebanese figures like Samir Kassir. Al-Mir, who was released from a previous ten-year prison sentence related to political activism in 1999, visited Lebanon in 2006 to mourn the killing of George Hawi, a <b>former</b> <b>leader</b> of the Lebanese Communist Party. According to Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, this contributed to al-Mir's arrest at the end of the year.|$|E
5|$|His {{investigations}} angered many in Mexico's {{political elite}} {{and made him}} a frequent target of death threats. Buendía took the death threats he received very seriously and thereby carried a pistol, either on his belt or in a leather pocket. Prior to his death, Buendía wrote extensively on the alleged corruption within Mexico's Petroleum Workers Union; the allegations of wrongdoings of Jorge Díaz Serrano, <b>former</b> <b>leader</b> of Pemex, the national oil company; and Arturo Durazo Moreno, {{the former head of}} Mexico City's police force. Buendía also criticized the role of the U.S. government and the CIA in Mexico, and often published names of American officials involved in secret operations. Although he was quick to publish controversial reports, Buendía's direct reporting was respected and generally considered reliable given his access to top Mexican officials. He was the most-read journalist in Mexico's print media, and is often cited by newspapers and journalists as the most influential political columnist in Mexico of {{the second half of the}} 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Ireland became {{home to one}} of Microsoft's {{international}} {{production facilities}} in 1985, and on November 20 Microsoft released its first retail version of Microsoft Windows (Windows 1.0), originally a graphical extension for its MS-DOS operating system. In August, Microsoft and IBM partnered {{in the development of a}} different operating system called OS/2. OS/2 was marketed in connection with a new hardware design proprietary to IBM, the PS/2. On February 16, 1986, Microsoft relocated their headquarters to a corporate office campus in Redmond, Washington. Around one month later, on March 13, the company went public with an IPO, raising US$61 million at US$21.00 per share. By the end of the trading day, the price had risen to US$28.00. In 1987, Microsoft eventually released their first version of OS/2 to OEMs. By then the company was the world's largest producer of software for personal computers—ahead of <b>former</b> <b>leader</b> Lotus Development—and published the three most-popular Macintosh business applications. That year the company purchased Forethought, the developer of PowerPoint and Microsoft's first major software acquisition.|$|E
