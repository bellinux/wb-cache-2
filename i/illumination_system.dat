25|$|The {{capacity}} {{has changed}} frequently, peaking at 32,989 in a 0–0 draw between Santos and Corinthians for the 1964 Campeonato Paulista. Since then, {{there have been}} a number of reductions due to modernizations. The last change was a new <b>illumination</b> <b>system</b> being installed on January 27, 1998, with an illumnination level of 1200 lux, more than the FIFA minimum recommendation. The Vila Belmiro was one of the venues of the 1949 Copa América, hosted the 1962 Copa Libertadores final and the 1998 Copa CONMEBOL final. It has also hosted a Copa do Brasil final in 2010. Due to its relative-low capacity, Santos has used other stadiums for high-profile matches such as the Estádio Palestra Itália, Pacaembu and Morumbi, all located in São Paulo, and the Maracanã in Rio de Janeiro. Current Santos President Luis Alvaro Ribeiro and other club directors are agreeing on building a stadium in a city nearby Santos called Cubatao, a stadium for 40,000 people which would become Santos' home field for almost 70% of the games during the season which would increase the team's profit.|$|E
25|$|In 1921, the English {{residents}} of Peru that owned the stadium renovated and renamed the stadium from Estadio Guadalupe to Stadium Nacional and donated {{it to the}} Peruvian government. It had small wooden stands that were later donated to the Estadio Teodoro Lolo Fernandez when it was demolished {{to make way for}} the new stadium which would host the 1953 South American Championship. In the 1950s, Miguel Dasso and the Peruvian President General Manuel A. Odria funded the project for the construction of the new stadium. The new stadium was planned to have capacity of 53,000 and have it entirely made out of cement. The northern and southern stands would have a capacity of 15,000 each while the eastern and western stands would have three levels. On 27 October 1952, the new Estadio Nacional was inaugurated with many comfortable features such as luxury boxes and elevators in one of the stands. The inauguration ceremony started early at 10:00 AM and lasted through the night. The ceremony included an award ceremony for many outstanding athletes including Teodoro Fernández, Alejandro Villanueva, Jorge Alcalde, Olympic gold medalist Edwin Vásquez and Pan American gold medalists Julia Sánchez and Gerardo Salazar. The inaugurating football match was played between players of the Peru national football team that formed two teams that played in the evening under the new <b>illumination</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

According to Mikko Uromo, the technology allows them to [...] "simulate complex scenarios on a scale that hasn't been possible before" [...] and is crucial to the game's development. The team also worked significantly on the game's lighting system. It was designed to be dynamic, and the team refined it to include eyes and hair.

40|$|Abstract: Modern {{automotive}} <b>illumination</b> <b>systems</b> require higher efficiency, safety, {{and good}} aesthetic features. The design, fabrication and measurement are critical issues for automotive <b>illumination</b> <b>systems.</b> The non-imaging optical {{design for the}} automotive lighting system, which departs from the methods of traditional optical design, is an arisen interdisciplinary field. In {{order to meet the}} traffic regulations, unique freeform shapes and geometries should be adopted to create the special legal light pattern.

And the measurement of the freeform surface is also a new area. In this paper, the optical design, fabrication and the measurement of the freeform reflector headlamps are investigated...|$|R
