50|$|Hosiery {{garments}} are {{the product}} of hosiery fabric produced from <b>hosiery</b> <b>yarn.</b> Like the yarn used for making woven fabric, <b>hosiery</b> <b>yarn</b> comes from a separate spinning (yarn making) process, and is used with circular knitting machines to form fabric. One or more <b>hosiery</b> <b>yarn</b> is used to make knitted or hosiery fabric, and garments produced out of this are generally referred to as hosiery garments.|$|E

50|$|Hollar Hosiery Mills-Knit Sox Knitting Mills is a {{historic}} knitting mill located at Hickory, Catawba County, North Carolina. It consists of two mill brick manufacturing buildings and a boiler house that were connected by a hyphen in the mid-1960s. The first mill building was built about 1930, and is a one- to two-story, 16 bay, brick veneer structure. The boiler house was also built about 1930, and is a small, brick building, with its flat roof and terra cotta coping. The <b>hosiery</b> <b>yarn</b> mill was built about 1940, and is two-story, six bay by 10 bay, brick-veneered building. Both mill buildings feature banks of steel-sash factory windows. The knitting mill operated until 1968.|$|E
50|$|Texas Mill {{was used}} for {{spinning}} medium counts of American cotton. In 1951 it was spinning high-class combed and carded <b>hosiery</b> <b>yarns</b> from 20's to 40's count. In 1971 it was spinning artificial fibres.|$|R
50|$|The Texel is a {{breed of}} {{domestic}} sheep originally {{from the island}} of Texel in the Netherlands. It is now a popular lean meat sheep in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Uruguay and Europe. The Texel is a heavily muscled sheep. It produces a lean meat carcass and will pass on this quality to crossbred progeny. The wool is around 32 micrometres and is mostly used for <b>hosiery</b> <b>yarns</b> and knitting wools.|$|R

It produces yarns for knitting and weaving (in grey and dyed) and hand knitting <b>yarns,</b> <b>hosiery</b> machine knitting <b>yarns,</b> cotton yarn (ring spun and rotor yarn), bath matt yarns, carpet yarns, fancy yarns, home furnishing yarns, and mink blanket yarns.|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] Traveller has a {{great impact}} on yarn quality {{parameters}} specially hairiness. Yarn quality varies due to different traveller number. The traveller imparts twist to the yarn and enables winding of the yarn on the cop. However, cooperating assembly, the spindle is required for the winding operation. High contact pressure (up to 35 N/mm 2) is generated between the ring and traveller during winding, mainly due to centrifugal force. This research was established according to yarn parameter of hairiness, U%, IPI, i. e. imperfection index and end breakage rate per 1000 spindle-hr. It is very important for the technologist to understand this and act on them to optimize the yarn production. Specific number of traveller should be used for a particular count of yarn.

5000|$|On 7 January 1921 all the syndicate's mills {{went into}} {{voluntary}} liquidation and were {{passed to the}} Atlas Mills Ltd. group [...] They were struggling. The Bank of England set up the Lancashire Cotton Corporation in 1929 to attempt to rationalise and save the industry. Atlas Mills Limited {{was taken over by}} the LCC in 1929. Thus, Texas Mill was one of 104 mills brought into LCC ownership, and one of the 53 mills that survived through to 1950. It had been converted to rings and it produced 20 to 40 count high class combed and carded <b>hosiery</b> <b>yarns.</b> Later it converted to artificial fibres. Still spinning, was destroyed by fire 22-23 October 1971.|$|R
50|$|In adult sheep {{the front}} {{legs and the}} rear legs below the hocks are free of wool. The feet are mainly black. The meat has a more complex flavour than most {{commercial}} breeds, highly prized {{since the time of}} George III. They produce 2-3 kg. of 50's-60's down-quality wool with a staple length of 6-9 cm (2.5-3.5 in), which is suitable for <b>hosiery</b> and hand-knitting <b>yarns.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{leaf spring}} {{industry}} has {{its presence in}} Mangalore, with Canara Workshops Ltd. and Lamina Suspension Products Ltd. in the city. The Old Mangalore Port is a fishing port located at Bunder in Mangalore, where {{a large number of}} mechanised boats anchor. The traffic at this port was 122,000 tonnes during the years 2003â€“04. Fishing is a traditional occupation, and the products are exported to the surrounding regions. Mangalorean firms have a major presence in the tile, beedi, coffee, and cashew nut industry, although the tile industry has declined due to concrete being preferred in modern construction. The Albuquerque tile factory in Mangalore is one of India's oldest red roof tile manufacturing factories. The Ullal suburb of Mangalore produces <b>hosiery</b> and coir <b>yarns,</b> while beedi rolling is an important source of revenue to many in the city.|$|R

40|$|Impact of the ginning method on fiber {{quality and}} textile {{processing}} performance of Long Staple Upland cotton Marinus HJ van der Sluijs 1, 2 With the {{increased demand for}} quality {{and the production of}} finer, longer and stronger Upland cottons, an increasing proportion of these cottons are ginned on roller gins to preserve and improve fiber quality. However, although the benefits of roller ginning on lint turn out and fiber quality are fairly well understood, it is still unclear whether these improvements translate into improved yarn quality and processing performance. The aim of this research was to com-pare the impact of saw and roller ginning on Long Staple Upland cotton in a high-production and commercial environ-ment and to evaluate quality and textile processing performance in a commercial textile mill. One field located within the central cotton growing area of Australia was planted with a Long Staple Upland variety, with a number of round modules selected at random from the field and processed by a saw and a rotary knife roller gin. There was {{a significant difference between the}} two ginning methods in some of the average fiber results, with the roller ginned fiber longer and more uniform with fewer short fibers and fibrous neps, as well as stronger with higher elongation. These improved fiber properties resulted in significant differences in the fine count combed <b>hosiery</b> ring spun <b>yarn</b> produced. On average the yarn spun from roller ginned cotton was significantly more even with fewer total imperfections, although there was no significant difference in yarn count, strength, elongation and hairiness. There were also no significant differences in terms of processing performance, fabric handle, appearance and strength...|$|R
