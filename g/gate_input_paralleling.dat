40|$|Abstract—A novel {{interleaved}} series <b>input</b> <b>parallel</b> output ZVS forward converter (ISIPO ZVSFC) {{is proposed}} in this paper. The series <b>input</b> and <b>parallel</b> output architecture enables the converter cells {{to share the}} input voltage and output current equally. The interleaved operation diminishes the output current ripple in the output capacitor. That reduces {{the size of the}} output filter. By using active-clamp circuit and resonant circuit, the converter can achieve ZVS operation for all the main and auxiliary switches. The active-clamp circuit is also used to reset the energy stored in the leakage inductor to minimize the voltage spike on switching devices. All these features make the proposed converter suitable for dc-dc converters with high input voltage, high output current, high power and high efficiency applications. An experimental prototype with 400 V input and 24 V/ 480 W output is built to verify the theoretical analysis and the performance.

40|$|Publisher’s {{permission}} requested and denied. Artifact from {{electrical stimulation}} imposes {{a problem for}} the recording of physiological responses to electrical stimulation. Here we describe a simple, low-cost, gated differential amplifier for the recording of physiological responses to electrical stimulation. The gain of the amplifier is set to 1 during electrical stimulation by setting the <b>gate</b> <b>input</b> to a high logic state to avoid overloading of the amplifier by the artifact. Following electrical stimulation, the <b>gate</b> <b>input</b> is set to a low logic state, resulting in again of 1000 for frequencies between 300 Hz and 25 kHz (- 3 dB points). The gain at low frequencies (0 - 0. 2 Hz) is held constant at 1 to avoid transients in the output signal arising from changes in gain at these frequencies. The gain of the amplifier following stimulation (gate low) was independent of the magnitude of the artifact and was therefore suitable for the measurement of neural field potentials with low impedance electrodes.
