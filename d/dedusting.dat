50|$|The raw {{material}} is given loose or in bales into the primary reduction unit (for example a shredder). After this reduction, the flame retardant is added. The {{core of the}} cellulose insulating material plant is a Whirlwind Mill. This mill is able to fray out the material, what leads to fluffy, optimally defibrated flocks that contain only very small amounts of dust. Furthermore the flame retardant is stuck to the flocks during the defibration process. After the mill the material is conveyed pneumatically to the <b>dedusting</b> unit, where the dusty air and the cellulose fibers get separated. The finished fibers come to the packaging station, {{where they will be}} weight and packaged.|$|E

During the middle-age Rottenburg was a center of the witch-hunt. The carnival group [...] "Elbenlocher Hexen" [...] is an allusion to that. In 1989 the [...] "Narrenzunft Schwalldorf" [...] (Carnival Guild Schwalldorf) was founded. Nowadays the Carnival Guild has three carnival groups, two music groups and several single characters.
