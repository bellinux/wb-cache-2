40|$|We have {{evaluated}} {{blood samples}} of chronic and congenital Trypanosoma cruzi -infected patients {{from the city}} of Reconquista located in the northeast of Argentina where no information was previously obtained about the genotype of infecting parasites. Fourteen samples of congenital and 19 chronical patients were analyzed by hybridization with DNA probes of minicircle hypervariable regions (mHVR). In congenital patients, 50 % had single <b>infections</b> <b>with</b> TcIId, 7 % single <b>infections</b> <b>with</b> TcIIe, 29 % mixed <b>infections</b> <b>with</b> TcIId/e, and 7 % had mixed <b>infections</b> <b>with</b> TcIId/b and 7 % TcIId/b, respectively. In Chronical patients, 52 % had single <b>infections</b> <b>with</b> TcIId, 11 % single <b>infections</b> <b>with</b> TcIIe, 26 % had mixed <b>infections</b> <b>with</b> TcIId/e, and 11 % had non-identified genotypes. With these samples, we evaluated the minicircle lineage-specific polymerase chain reaction assay (MLS-PCR), which involves a nested PCR to HVR minicircle sequences and we found a correlation with hybridization probes of 96. 4 % for TcIId and 54. 8 % for TcIIe.

5|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes HIV infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

40|$|The field {{devoted to}} the {{identification}} of parasite remains in the archaeological record and the reconstruction of past human-parasite interactions. Parasitic disease {{has always been a}} major problem. Recent summaries of the prevalence of parasitic diseases in the world today show that there are 4. 5 billion <b>infections</b> <b>with</b> all species of parasitic worm, 1 billion <b>infections</b> <b>with</b> giant intestinal roundworm (Ascaris lumbricoides), 750, 000, 000 <b>infections</b> <b>with</b> whipworms (Trichuris trichiura), 900, 000, 000 <b>infections</b> <b>with</b> hookworm (Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus), 657, 000, 000 <b>infections</b> <b>with</b> filarial worms, 200, 000, 000 with blood flukes (schistosome species), and 489, 000, 000 <b>infections</b> <b>with</b> malaria. These <b>infections</b> cause between 1, 590, 000 to 3, 130, 000 million deaths per year (Roberts and Janovy 1996 : 2). One can see from these statistics that any contribution to understanding human parasitism will contribute to reducing the parasite problem. The archaeological record provides the necessary time depth to document the origins of human parasitism. Modern archaeology is sufficiently refined to identify the behavioral and ecological conditions that led to the emergence of parasitism as a threat to human well-being. Therefore, archaeology is a field of important basic research {{that can be used to}} address the rise of parasitism in addition to issues of purely archaeological significance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Escherichia coli {{infections are}} {{frequent}} in ICU patients. The increased resistance to fluoroquinolones and amoxicillin/clavulanate of this pathogen mandates the prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics such as piperacillin/tazobactam (PIP-TAZ) or third generation cephalosporins (3 GC). Methods To assess incidence and impact on clinical outcome of <b>infections</b> <b>with</b> PIP-TAZ resistant E. coli in ICU patients, {{we conducted a}} retrospective cohort study <b>with</b> <b>infections</b> due to PIP-TAZ resistant (PIP-TAZ R) or to PIP-TAZ susceptible strains (PIP-TAZ S) between 1 January 2002 and 30 June 2004. Results Of 83 strains, 13 were PIP-TAZ R: 2 strains produced an extended-spectrum β-lactamase (2 %), 11 produced a high level penicillinase (13 %). Prior amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate prescription was reported in 7 cases (54 %) of <b>infections</b> <b>with</b> PIP-TAZ R isolates and in 15 cases (21 %) of <b>infections</b> <b>with</b> PIP-TAZ S isolates (p = 0. 03). Time of onset of the infection from hospital admission was longer in case of <b>infections</b> <b>with</b> PIP-TAZ R than with PIP-TAZ S isolates (22 ± 32 vs 10 ± 21 days, p = 0. 01). The overall ICU mortality rate was 38 %. Mortality and length of stay in ICU were similar in case of <b>infections</b> <b>with</b> PIP-TAZ R isolates and with PIP-TAZ S isolates. Conclusion <b>Infections</b> <b>with</b> PIP-TAZ R E. coli are frequent in ICU patients. No prognostic impact of this pattern of resistance was found. Prescription of PIP-TAZ for empirical treatment of E. coli infections in ICU however exposes to inappropriate therapy. </p...|$|R
5|$|Because {{the oral}} polio vaccine is inexpensive, easy to administer, and {{produces}} excellent immunity in the intestine (which helps prevent <b>infection</b> <b>with</b> wild virus in areas where it is endemic), {{it has been the}} vaccine of choice for controlling poliomyelitis in many countries. On very rare occasions (about one case per 750,000 vaccine recipients), the attenuated virus in the {{oral polio vaccine}} reverts into a form that can paralyze. Most industrialized countries have switched to inactivated polio vaccine, which cannot revert, either as the sole vaccine against poliomyelitis or in combination with oral polio vaccine.|$|E
5|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is {{a spectrum of}} conditions caused by <b>infection</b> <b>with</b> the human {{immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV). Following initial infection, a person may not notice any symptoms or may experience {{a brief period of}} influenza-like illness. Typically, this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms. As the infection progresses, it interferes more with the immune system, increasing the risk of common infections like tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors that rarely affect people who have working immune systems. These late symptoms of infection are referred to as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). This stage is often also associated with weight loss.|$|E
5|$|<b>Infection</b> <b>with</b> {{smallpox}} {{is focused}} in small blood vessels {{of the skin}} and in the mouth and throat before disseminating. In the skin it results in a characteristic maculopapular rash and, later, raised fluid-filled blisters. V. major produced a more serious disease and had an overall mortality rate of 30–35 percent. V. minor caused a milder form of disease (also known as alastrim) which killed about 1 percent of those it infects. Long-term complications of V. major infection included characteristic scars, commonly on the face, which occur in 65–85 percent of survivors. Blindness resulting from corneal ulceration and scarring, and limb deformities due to arthritis and osteomyelitis were less common complications, seen in about 2–5 percent of cases.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not entirely}} clear why {{secondary}} <b>infection</b> <b>with</b> a different strain of dengue virus places people at risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. The most widely accepted hypothesis is that of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). The exact mechanism behind ADE is unclear. It {{may be caused by}} poor binding of non-neutralizing antibodies and delivery into the wrong compartment of white blood cells that have ingested the virus for destruction.

5|$|It {{is widely}} {{suspected}} that the anaerobic bacterial species Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) contributes {{to the development of}} acne, but its exact role is not well understood. There are specific sub-strains of P. acnes associated with normal skin, and moderate or severe inflammatory acne. It is unclear whether these undesirable strains evolve on-site or are acquired, or possibly both depending on the person. These strains have the capability of changing, perpetuating, or adapting to the abnormal cycle of inflammation, oil production, and inadequate sloughing of dead skin cells from acne pores. <b>Infection</b> <b>with</b> the parasitic mite Demodex is associated with the development of acne.

5|$|Of these viruses {{the most}} serious and {{prevalent}} are NDV, NYSV and NWSV. NDV is associated with chlorotic leaf striping in N. tazetta. <b>Infection</b> <b>with</b> NYSV produces light or grayish green, or yellow stripes or mottles on the upper two-thirds of the leaf, which may be roughened or twisted. The flowers which may be smaller than usual may also be streaked or blotched. NWSV produces greenish-purple streaking on the leaves and stem turning white to yellow, and premature senescence reducing bulb size and yield. These viruses are primarily diseases of commercial nurseries. The growth inhibition caused by viral infection can cause substantial economic damage.|$|E
