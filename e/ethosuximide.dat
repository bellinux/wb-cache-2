5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{medications}} available including phenytoin, carbamazepine and valproate. Low-quality evidence suggests that phenytoin, carbamazepine, and valproate may be equally effective in both focal and generalized seizures. Controlled release carbamazepine appears to work as well as immediate release carbamazepine, and may have fewer side effects. In the United Kingdom, carbamazepine or lamotrigine are recommended as first-line treatment for focal seizures, with levetiracetam and valproate as second-line due to issues of cost and side effects. Valproate is recommended first-line for generalized seizures with lamotrigine being second-line. In those with absence seizures, <b>ethosuximide</b> or valproate are recommended; valproate is particularly effective in myoclonic seizures and tonic or atonic seizures. If seizures are well-controlled on a particular treatment, it is not usually necessary to routinely check the medication levels in the blood.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} by which <b>ethosuximide</b> affects neuronal excitability includes block of T-type calcium channels, and may include effects of the drug on other classes of ion channel. The primary finding that <b>ethosuximide</b> is a T-type calcium channel blocker gained widespread support, but initial attempts to replicate the finding were inconsistent. Subsequent experiments on recombinant T-type channels in cell lines demonstrated conclusively that <b>ethosuximide</b> blocks all T-type calcium channel isoforms. Significant T-type calcium channel density occurs in dendrites of neurons, and recordings from reduced preparations that strip away this dendritic source of T-type calcium channels {{may have contributed to}} reports of <b>ethosuximide</b> ineffectiveness.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ethosuximide,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Zarontin among others, is a {{medication}} used to treat absence seizures. It may be used by itself or with other antiseizure medications such as valproic acid. <b>Ethosuximide</b> is taken by mouth.|$|E

25|$|<b>Ethosuximide</b> was {{approved}} {{for medical use}} in the United States in 1960. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, {{the most effective and}} safe medicines needed in a health system. <b>Ethosuximide</b> is available as a generic medication. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 27.77 USD per month. In the United States the wholesale cost as of 2016 is about 41.55 USD per month for a typical dose.|$|E
25|$|Valproates {{can either}} {{decrease}} or increase {{the levels of}} ethosuximide; however, combinations of valproates and <b>ethosuximide</b> had a greater protective index than either drug alone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ethosuximide</b> is marketed {{under the}} trade names Emeside and Zarontin. However, both capsule {{preparations}} were discontinued from production, leaving only generic preparations available.

Syrup preparations of both brands remained available.|$|E
25|$|That same year, however, Herrington and Lingle {{found no}} such effect at {{concentrations}} {{of up to}} 2.5mmol/L. The year after, a study conducted on human neocortical cells removed during surgery for intractable epilepsy, {{the first to use}} human tissue, found that <b>ethosuximide</b> had no effect on Ca2+ currents at the concentrations typically needed for a therapeutic effect.|$|E
25|$|Side {{effects are}} {{generally}} minimal. Common side effects include loss of appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and feeling tired. Serious side effects include suicidal thoughts, low blood cell levels, and lupus erythematosus.

25|$|In 1998, Slobodan M. Todorovic and Christopher J. Lingle of Washington University {{reported}} a 100% block of T-type current in {{dorsal root ganglia}} at 23.7 ± 0.5mmol/L, far higher than Kostyuk reported. That same year, Leresche et al. reported that <b>ethosuximide</b> {{had no effect on}} T-type currents, but did decrease noninactivating Na+ current by 60% and the Ca2+-activated K+ currents by 39.1 ± 6.4% in rat and cat thalamocortical cells. It was concluded that the decrease in Na+ current is responsible for the anti-absence properties.|$|E
25|$|In the {{introduction}} of a paper published in 2001, Dr. Juan Carlos Gomora and colleagues at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville pointed out that past studies were often done in isolated neurons that had lost most of their T-type channels. Using cloned α1G, α1H, and α1I T-type calcium channels, Gomora's team found that <b>ethosuximide</b> blocked the channels with an IC50 of 12 ± 2mmol/L and that of N-desmethylmethsuximide (the active metabolite of mesuximide) is 1.95 ± 0.19mmol/L for α1G, 1.82 ± 0.16mmol/L for α1I, and 3.0 ± 0.3mmol/L for α1H. It was suggested that the blockade of open channels is facilitated by ethosuximide's physically plugging the channels when current flows inward.|$|E
25|$|In March 1989, Coulter, Huguenard and Prince {{showed that}} <b>ethosuximide</b> and dimethadione, both {{effective}} anti-absence agents, reduced low-threshold Ca2+ currents in T-type calcium channels in freshly removed thalamic neurons. In June {{of that same}} year, they also found the mechanism of this reduction to be voltage-dependent, using acutely dissociated neurons of rats and guinea pigs; it was also noted that valproic acid, which is also used in absence seizures, did not do that. The next year, they showed that anticonvulsant succinimides did this and that the pro-convulsant ones did not. The first part was supported by Kostyuk et al. in 1992, who reported a substantial reduction in current in dorsal root ganglia at concentrations ranging from 7 µmol/L to 1mmol/L.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, primidone, {{along with}} phenobarbital, was a second-line agent in partial {{epilepsy}} {{with or without}} secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures {{and was one of}} four agents (the others being carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital) that was used along with <b>ethosuximide</b> or a benzodiazepine for any absence or myoclonic seizures when valproate failed to control tonic-clonics (at least in the United States). After zonisamide, other new anticonvulsants came onto the market: felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, and vigabatrin. All four were structurally distinct both from other anticonvulsants already on the market. They all had larger protective indexes than conventional agents and unlike these agents, the new ones did not cause birth defects in laboratory animals or antagonize folic acid. They seemed to be relatively mild in terms of side effects. Out of all of them lamotrigine was the most similar to phenytoin in its pattern of efficacy. Felbamate was the most effective for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and was seen as a second-line agent in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy after valproate. These new agents were aggressively marketed. In 1994, felbamate became the anticonvulsant of last resort after ten people out of 100,000 came down with aplastic anemia.|$|E
500|$|Antiepileptic drugs may {{be given}} to prevent further seizures; these drugs {{completely}} eliminate seizures for about 35% of people with PTE. However, antiepileptics only prevent seizures while they are being taken; they do not reduce the occurrence once the patient stops taking the drugs. Medication may be stopped after seizures have been controlled for twoyears. PTE is commonly difficult to treat with drug therapy, and antiepileptic drugs {{may be associated with}} side effects. [...] The antiepileptics carbamazepine and valproate are the most common drugs used to treat PTE; phenytoin may also be used but may increase risk of cognitive side effects such as impaired thinking. [...] Other drugs commonly used to treat PTE include clonazepam, phenobarbitol, primidone, gabapentin, and <b>ethosuximide.</b> [...] Among antiepileptic drugs tested [...] for seizure prevention after TBI (phenytoin, sodium valproate, carbamazepine, phenobarbital), no evidence from randomized controlled trials has shown superiority of one over another.|$|E

50|$|Treatment of {{patients}} with absence seizures only is mainly with valproic acid or <b>ethosuximide,</b> which are of equal efficacy controlling absences in around 75% {{of patients}}. Lamotrigine monotherapy is less effective, with {{nearly half of the}} patients becoming seizure free. This view has been recently confirmed by Glauser et al. (2010), who studied the effects of <b>ethosuximide,</b> valproic acid, and lamotrigine in children with newly diagnosed childhood absence epilepsy. Drug dosages were incrementally increased until the child was free of seizures, the maximal allowable dose was reached, or a criterion indicating treatment failure was met. The primary outcome was freedom from treatment failure after 16 weeks of therapy; the secondary outcome was attentional dysfunction. After 16 weeks of therapy, the freedom-from-failure rates for <b>ethosuximide</b> and valproic acid were similar and were higher than the rate for lamotrigine. There {{were no significant differences between}} the three drugs with regard to discontinuation because of adverse events. Attentional dysfunction was more common with valproic acid than with ethosuximide.If monotherapy fails or unacceptable adverse reactions appear, replacement of one by another of the three antiepileptic drugs is the alternative. Adding small doses of lamotrigine to sodium valproate may be the best combination in resistant cases.|$|E
