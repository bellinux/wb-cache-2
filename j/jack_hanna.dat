All {{of the groups}} use the recently constructed Hatfield Hall for performances, rehearsal space, and storage. Most performing arts groups have published recordings used to recruit prospective students and promote the school's performing arts programs. In addition to these groups, Rose–Hulman also has the Performing Arts Series which brings mainstream acts to Hatfield Hall for the cultural enrichment of both the campus and community. Recent acts have included <b>Jack</b> <b>Hanna,</b> the Harlem Gospel Choir, and the East Village Opera Company all of whose shows sold out completely {{in only a few}} days. The 2013 Performing Arts Series {{is expected to be a}} success with many shows selling out due to the expected popularity of the shows including MOMIX, the Russian National Ballet, and John Pizzarelli.|$|E

2500|$|The {{fact that}} the special {{election}} coincided with contested Democratic gubernatorial and U.S. Senate primaries {{may have led to}} increased voter turnout among Democrats, benefiting Critz; however, <b>Jack</b> <b>Hanna,</b> the chair of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party's southwestern caucus, said [...] "There's going to be a lackluster turnout {{in part because of the}} governor's race not generating the kind of interest that usually occurs, especially with an open seat." [...] The special election coinciding with the primary also meant that Critz and Burns were running against one another, while also running against opponents from within their own parties in the regularly scheduled primary. On March 19, 2010, Republican candidate William Russell, who lost the Republican nomination to Burns and also ran against Burns in the regularly scheduled primary, stated that he would not directly support Burns as a protest against the process by which Burns was selected, saying [...] "I won't support a process that is not open and free." [...] Russell also said he would vote for himself as a write-in candidate in the special election. Burns's campaign manager said that Burns would focus on the special election rather than the simultaneous primary, saying [...] "If we can get enough support going in the special then we'll have the primary too." [...] The candidacy of Libertarian Party nominee Demo Agoris may also have detracted from Burns's share of the vote.|$|E

2500|$|The {{incident}} sparked {{debate among}} biologists and primatologists on whether gorillas and other primates {{should be held}} in captivity at all. Primatologist Jane Goodall said that according to the video it seemed Harambe was {{trying to protect the}} child. Goodall later issued a longer explanation {{in an interview with the}} president of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, concluding that the zoo had no choice but to kill Harambe. She wrote, [...] "It was awful for the child, the parents, Harambe, the zoo, the keepers and the public. But when people come into contact with wild animals, life and death decisions sometimes have to be made." [...] Goodall said that as long as humans and wild animals are kept in close proximity in zoos, there is no way to prevent accidents from happening, but she believed that zoos [...] "with the highest standards of care" [...] could play an important role. Zookeeper <b>Jack</b> <b>Hanna</b> strongly defended the zoo's actions as the [...] "correct decision", noting that a tranquilizer dart might have taken five or ten minutes to take effect and could have aggravated Harambe further. Primatologist Frans de Waal said he saw few options for the zoo: [...] "A gorilla is so immensely strong that even with the best of intentions—and we are not sure that Harambe had those—the child's death was a probable outcome.” ...|$|E
