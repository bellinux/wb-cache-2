40|$|Abstract. This paper {{analyzes}} {{the principle of}} operation, the feature of systems, the contrast of {{advantages and disadvantages of}} the two different systems which are Full-flow dilution sampling system (FFDSS) and Partial-flow dilution sampling system (PFDSS). This paper researches the correlation of this two different systems and the ways of improving the correlation. Many researches show that the correlation of the PM's test is below 10 %. The PFDSS can replace the FFDSS in the special case. Some detailed suggestions of improving the systems to meet the future requirements are presented in the last of this paper. Preface The rapid development of automobile technology promoted the experimental technology updated. In order to identify the measured vehicle emissions to the actual conditions as closely as possible, the laboratory must have the complex simulation equipment, the accurate auto exhaust sampling and system and the precise exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>apparatus.</b> At present, the emission regulations of most countries in the world use the constant volume sampling system (CVS) as the standard system [1].

40|$|This {{dissertation}} summarises {{the study}} of {{different aspects of the}} aerosol-assisted chemical vapour deposition (AACVD) technique for the production of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Upscaling the synthesis while retaining the quality of MWCNTs has been a prime objective throughout the work. A key aspect of this work was {{the study of}} different growth parameters and their influence on the homogeneity of the products across the reactor. The effect of the precursor composition on the yield and quality of MWCNTs were also investigated. It was shown that the synthesis rate can be significantly (60 – 80 %) increased by tuning the composition of the precursor. Moreover, by optimising the synthesis recipe and using a larger reactor, the synthesis rate and efficiency of the precursor were increased fivefold (up to 14 g/hr) and twice (up to 88 %) respectively. Large area (up to 90 cm 2), mm-thick carpets of MWCNTs which were both free-standing and on substrate were produced. The carpets could withstand normal handlings without tearing apart, making them suitable for macroscopic characterisations and applications. By in-situ qualitative and quantitative <b>gas</b> <b>analysis</b> of the atmosphere of the reactor, the thermocatalytic cracking behaviour of 25 precursors was investigated and a mechanism for successive formation of different hydrocarbon fragments inside the reactor was proposed. A number of dedicated <b>gas</b> <b>analysis</b> methods and <b>apparatuses</b> such as a probe for zone-by-zone <b>gas</b> <b>analysis</b> of reactor and a heated chamber for preparation of standard <b>gas</b> <b>analysis</b> samples were developed to explore some of the least investigated aspects of the thermocatalytic cracking of precursors. Mapping the reactor revealed that some single-wall and double-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs and DWCNTs) were also produced near the exhaust of the reactor. The SWCNTs were partly covered by fullerene-like species and resembled different forms of carbon nanobuds. In addition, the effect of the electron beam on the interaction of the SWCNTs and the fullerene-like species was studied in situ using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM).

Then, at once, {{the last part of}} this expired air was collected into a vacuous sampling tube introduced air-tight through a hole at the wall of the hose-pipe near the mouth piece, and analysed by means of Haldane's <b>gas</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Conclusion: 1) The CO(2) -pressure in normal resting alveolar air, taken by the original method in a sitting position is 40. 4 mm- 43. 5 mm of Hg, and the O(2) -pressure in it is 96. 5 mm- 108. 2 mm of Hg. 2) After 2 times forced breathings, the CO(2) -pressure in alveolar air is remarkably diminished, that is, to 27. 1 mm- 28. 7 mm of Hg, and the O(2) -pressure raised to 128. 7 mm- 131. 0 mm of Hg.

The animal, which {{proved to be an}} old female, was blind, and having been wounded with a rifle shot while it sat on the rocks in front of the station,was securedwitha gaffasitattemptedtoescapeand broughtto shore. There itwas killedby severingthe greatvesselsin the neck and a sample of 200 cc. of blood was collected as it flowed from the wound. The animal was somewhat emaciated, but was not in a starving condition as evidenced by a quantity of fish in its stomach and the abundance of fat in the lacteals. The bullet wounds were found to be limited to bony and muscular structures and had not caused extensive bleeding. We are indebted to Dr. G. E. MacGinitie for placing the blood at our disposal. The blood was prevented from clotting by the addition of potassium oxalate; and was kept on ice during the subsequent sixteen hours in which measurements were made. Samples were equilibrated with vari ous gas mixtures in a water bath at 380 C. for 20 minutes and then analyzed for oxygen or carbon dioxide with the Van Slyke â€œ¿constant volumeâ€ • apparatus. The gas mixtures were subsequently analyzed with the Haldane <b>gas</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>apparatus.</b> The resulting data are re corded in Tables I and II. In order to correct the observed oxygen contents for the dissolved oxygen, an absorption coefficient of a 0. 022 was assumed.

40|$|Background Point-of-care blood <b>gas</b> <b>analysis</b> is {{considered}} a standard of care in modern air ambulance operations by many professional organisations for clinical assessment and monitoring of patients. Instances where point-of-care blood <b>gas</b> <b>analysis</b> has identified clinically significant abnormalities which then led to clinical intervention are well documented and have been quantified previously in the air ambulance environment. However, results obtained from point-of-care blood <b>gas</b> <b>analysis</b> are not always required for patient care, nor do they always result in any clinical action {{on the part of}} the medical crew. Our question therefore related to the data for a Johannesburg based jet air ambulance service. Methods By means of retrospective case reviews over a one year period, we reviewed the overall frequency of utilisation of point-of-care blood <b>gas</b> <b>analysis</b> on patient transportations within a Johannesburg based jet air ambulance service.

Acid-base unbalances are respiratory acidosis, respiratory alkalosis, metabolic acidosis, and metabolic alkalosis. Metabolic acidosis is frequently appeared in clinical state. Arterial blood <b>gas</b> <b>analysis</b> is {{considered as a}} basic test to {{the intensive care unit}} patient and emergency state. Recently some researches were done, comparing with arterial blood <b>gas</b> <b>analysis</b> and venous blood <b>gas</b> <b>analysis.</b> Because of venous blood sampling is safer than arterial blood <b>gas</b> <b>analysis,</b> and beside not so different among them for detecting pH, pCO 2, HCO 3, except pO 2 measuring.
