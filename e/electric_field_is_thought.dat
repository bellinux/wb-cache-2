40|$|Electrical {{insulation}} {{is known}} to age when under electrical stress. One cause of this is thought {{to relate to the}} movement and build up of charge within the insulation. The emission of a low level of light from polymeric materials when under electrical stressing is shown to occur before the onset of currently detectable material degradation. This light is termed electroluminescence (EL) and under an ac <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> to relate to the interaction of charge in close proximity to the electrode-polymer interface. Understanding the cause of this light emission gives a very high resolution way of monitoring charge interaction and its influence on material ageing. This report presents the improvement to a system to measure changes in EL emission during the cycle of the applied field (point on wave measurements) under various electric fields. To investigate the relationship between EL and ageing, 100 ?m, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) films were ultraviolet (UV) aged in 3 and 7 day intervals up to 17 days. The samples were aged in both air and nitrogen environments to separate the affect of photo-oxidation from photo irradiation reactions on charge movement. Changes as a result of ageing were characterised in terms of optical, chemical and electrical properties. These were investigated using ultraviolet and visible (UV-Vis) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, ac ramp breakdown measurements and dielectric spectroscopy. The accumulation of space charge (SC) was then investigated using the pulsed electro acoustic (PEA) technique. This collection of results were used to explain changes in EL in terms of intensity and phase difference. A model using the bipolar charge recombination theory was then developed using trends shown in the characterising measurements to explain changes in EL. Results support the use of EL as a tool to investigate changes in charge movement very near the electrode-polymer interface...|$|E
40|$|Electrical {{insulation}} {{ages and}} degrades until its eventual failure under electrical stress. One {{cause of this}} relates to the movement and accumulation of charge within the insulation. The emission of {{a low level of}} light from polymeric materials while under electrical stressing occurs before the onset of currently detectable material degradation. This light is known as electroluminescence (EL) and under an ac <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> to relate to the interaction of charge in close proximity to the electrode-polymer interface. Understanding the cause of this light emission gives a very high-resolution method of monitoring charge interaction and its influence on material ageing. A possible cause of this light emission is the bipolar charge recombination theory. This theory involves the injection, trapping and recombination of charge carriers during each half cycle of the applied field [1]. This work compares two models that to simulate the EL emission according to this bipolar charge recombination theory. Model 1 assumes a fixed space charge region and all injected charge is uniformly distributed in this region with charges able to either become trapped or to recombine with opposite polarity charge carriers [2]. This recombination relates directly the excitation needed for the emission of a photon of light as measured in experiments. Model 2 develops on this by accounting for the transport and extraction of charge with an exponential distribution of trap levels rather than a uniform distribution [3]. Figure 1 shows a good correlation between the two models and experimental data. The full paper will describe the models in more detail and present results comparing the simulated and experimental results under various applied waveforms. Model 1 and model 2 both provide a good correlation with experimental data but model 2 allows a greater understanding of the space charge profile in the region close to the electrodes as well as the shape of the conduction current. Further work involves developing these models to support changes in the charge trapping profiles due to material ageing and supporting simulated results with measured conduction current...|$|E
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. This thesis analyses the effect of varying the compositions of co-evaporated V 205 /TeO 2, W 03 /CeO 2, SiO/TeO 2 and W 03 /TeO 2 amorphous thin films on their electrical and optical properties. Some information about the electronic properties of these oxides may be obtained by comparison of the results. In the oxide systems containing transition metal ions the expression for hopping energy at low temperatures contains a term due to the hopping energy of polarons {{in addition to that}} due to the disorder. In the dielectric SiO/TeO 2 thin films the distortion of 'the molecule is thought to be quite weak and thus the carriers do not form polarons. They would move by hopping at the band edge at low temperatures and by excitation to a mobility edge at high temperatures. The electrical conductivity of V 205 /TeO 2 amorphous thin films is discussed {{in the light of the}} Mott(1968) theory. The optical absorption edge was found to obey the direct forbidden transitions equation cc ico=B(fiw-EOP) 3 ' 2. The frequency-squared dependence of the conductivity of W 03 /CeO 2 thin films (high content of CeO 2) in the frequency region where the capacitance is constant is associated with the lead resistance according to Street et al (1971). The optical energy gap of the films varies with the composition in same way as in doped crystalline semiconductors. The value of the, optical W 03 /Ce 02 was calculated using the Davis and Mott (1970) formula for non-direct optical transitions. The capacitance of SiO/TeO 2 thin films is found to be almost independent of frequency as well as of temperature. This is due to a strong ionic bonding which characterises a good insulator. The optical absorption edge of SiO/TeO 2 is found to be sharper than that of W 03 / CeO 2 and very similar to that found in most crystalline solids. The value of the optical energy gap is calculated using the same formula as in W 03 /CeO 2. The systematic change of the optical gap with composition is observed only in a limited range of compositions. The a. c electrical properties of W 03 /Te 02 amorphous thin films are described using the Springett(1974) and Elliott(1977) models. The optical absorption edge of WO 3 /TeO 2 is found to lead to new arguments about the origin of the Urbach edges. The a. c electrical conductivity shows a frequency dependence of the form as ca wS in all samples studied in the present work. The mechanism of conduction at low temperatures with the index varying from 0. 5 to I is thought to be due to hopping of electrons between localized states in the gap. At high fields the d. c current shows a non-linear dependence on the applied electric field. This is thought to be due to either space charge or Schottky effects in the oxides containing transition metal ions. In SiO/TeO 2 dielectric films, the non-linear dependence of current on the <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> to be due to either the Poole-Frenkel effect or at slightly lower fields it could be due to impurities.

40|$|Transport of {{dry solid}} {{particles}} to a liquid {{is relevant to}} a number of emerging applications, including 'liquid marbles'. We report experiments where the transport of dry particles to a pendent water droplet is driven by an external <b>electric</b> <b>field.</b> Both hydrophilic and hydrophobic materials (silica, PMMA) were studied. For silica particles (hydrophilic, poorly conductive), a critical applied voltage initiated transfer, {{in the form of a}} rapid 'avalanche' of a large number of particles. The particle-loaded drop then detached, producing a metastable spherical agglomerate. Pure PMMA particles did not display this 'avalanche' behaviour, and when added to silica particles, appeared to cause aggregation and change the nature of the transfer mechanism. This paper is largely devoted to the avalanche process, in which deformation of the drop and radial compaction of the particle bed due to the <b>electric</b> <b>field</b> <b>are</b> <b>thought</b> to have played a central role.

Using mammalian cell lines (3 T 3, HeLa, and CHO cells), we tested one prevailing hypothesis, namely, that <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> polarize charged cell sur-face molecules, and that these polarized molecules drive directional motility. Neg-atively charged sialic acids, which contribute the bulk of cell surface charge, redistribute preferentially to the surface facing the direction of motility, as meas-ured by labeling with fluorescent wheat germ agglutinin. We treated cells with neuraminidase to remove sialic acids; as expected, this decreased total cell surface charge. We also changed cell surface charge independent of sialic acid moieties, by conjugating cationic avidin to the surface of live cells. Neuraminidase inhib-ited the electric field-induced directional polarization of membrane ruffling and a 4 integrin, while avidin treatment actually reversed the directional polarization of sialic acids. Neuraminidase treatment inhibited directionality but did not alter speed of motility. Surprisingly, avidin treatment did not significantly alter either directionality or speed of motility. Thus, our results demonstrate that electric field-induced polarization of charged species indeed occurs. However, polariza-tion of the bulk of charged cell surface proteins is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause motility, thus contradicting the second part of our hypothesis. Because neuraminidase inhibited directional motility, we also conclude that sialic acids are required constituents of some cell surface molecule(s) through which <b>electric</b> <b>fields</b> mount a polarized transmembrane response.

We measured the stimulus-response behavior of ampullary organs excised from skates. Under open-circuit conditions, the ampullary organ showed three distinct response states: spontaneous repetitive spikes, evoked spikes, and small, damped oscillatory responses. Under short-circuit conditions, the amplitude range for a linear current response to a sinusoidal (0. 5 Hz) voltage clamp of an organ (assessed by spectral analysis of the harmonics generated) was 7 – 200 microV rms. Changes in the spike firing rate of the afferent nerve innervating the organ were evident for voltage clamps of the ampullary epithelium of 3 microV and the spike rate saturated for clamp steps exceeding 100 microV. Thus, the linear response range of the ampullary epithelium exceeded the range in spike firing rate of the afferent nerve. The steady-state transorgan electrical properties under voltage clamp conditions were obtained by analysis of complex admittance determinations in the frequency range 0. 05 – 20 Hz for perturbations (< 100 microV rms) in the linear range. Admittance functions were distinctly related to the preparation states observed under open-circuit conditions. A negative real part in the organ admittance (i. e., a steady-state negative conductance generated by the preparation) was a common characteristic of the two (open-circuit) excitable states. The negative conductance was also confirmed by the direction of current flow through the ampullary epithelium in response to step voltage clamps. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
