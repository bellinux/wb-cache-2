50|$|The six tepals are {{approximately}} {{of the same}} shape and size, {{with the exception of}} the uppermost tepal, termed the labellum, which is considerably larger and usually heart-shaped. The tepals of the species of section Sessilis are 4 to 15 mm long and 0.5 to 2.5 mm wide. The tepals of the section Unguiculatis are 3 to 8.5 mm long and 1 to 3.5 mm wide. The labellum is about 5 to 25 mm long and 4 to 22 mm wide. The labellum encloses the <b>floral</b> <b>bud</b> until its opening, thereby protecting immature floral parts. The labellum is usually simple, but is occasionally bifurcated at the tip of the midrib.|$|E
40|$|Effects of {{temperature}} on the subsequent development in continuous light of <b>floral</b> <b>buds</b> formed after a single short-day cycle in Lemna perpusilla 6746, a short-day plant, were studied using fronds selected {{in relation to}} the order of emergence. The <b>floral</b> <b>buds</b> developed to stage 1 regardless of the temperature during the following CL. The rate of development, however, was slower at lower temperature. The minimum number of days in CL needed for the abortion of once formed <b>floral</b> <b>buds</b> increased with a de-crease in temperature, accompanied by an increase in the frond plastochron. Further-more, when the frond plastochron was altered by manipulation of the environmental conditions, i. e., light intensity or medium strength, the minimum number of days in CL required for the abortion of the <b>floral</b> <b>buds</b> also changed. These results suggest that the development pattern of <b>floral</b> <b>buds</b> in this plant is highly correlated with the frond plastochron. Key •words: Flowering — Lemna perpusilla — Plastochron — Temperature. Lemna perpusilla 6746, a short-day duckweed, is. induced to flower by a single short-day cycle (3), but the <b>floral</b> <b>buds</b> easily regress under noninductive photo-periodic cycles (4). This regression can be prevented by lowering the light intensity and/or temperature, but if these conditions are lowered beyond critical levels, new <b>floral</b> <b>buds</b> are initiated (9).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The genus Corylus is an {{important}} woody species in Northeast China. Its products, hazelnuts, constitute {{one of the most}} important raw materials for the pastry and chocolate industry. However, limited genetic research has focused on Corylus because of the lack of genomic resources. The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies provides a turning point for Corylus research. In the present study, we performed de novo transcriptome sequencing for the first time to produce a comprehensive database for the Corylus heterophylla Fisch <b>floral</b> <b>buds.</b> RESULTS: The C. heterophylla Fisch <b>floral</b> <b>buds</b> transcriptome was sequenced using the Illumina paired-end sequencing technology. We produced 28, 930, 890 raw reads and assembled them into 82, 684 contigs. A total of 40, 941 unigenes were identified, among which 30, 549 were annotated in the NCBI Non-redundant (Nr) protein database and 18, 581 were annotated in the Swiss-Prot database. Of these annotated unigenes, 25, 311 and 10, 514 unigenes were assigned to gene ontology (GO) categories and clusters of orthologous groups (COG), respectively. We could map 17, 207 unigenes onto 128 pathways using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Pathway (KEGG) database. Additionally, based on the transcriptome, we constructed a candidate cold tolerance gene set of C. heterophylla Fisch <b>floral</b> <b>buds.</b> The expression patterns of selected genes during four stages of cold acclimation suggested that these genes might be involved in different cold responsive stages in C. heterophylla Fisch <b>floral</b> <b>buds.</b> CONCLUSION: The transcriptome of C. heterophylla Fisch <b>floral</b> <b>buds</b> was deep sequenced, de novo assembled, and annotated, providing abundant data to better understand the C. heterophylla Fisch <b>floral</b> <b>buds</b> transcriptome. Candidate genes potentially involved in cold tolerance were identified, providing a material basis for future molecular mechanism analysis of C. heterophylla Fisch <b>floral</b> <b>buds</b> tolerant to cold stress...|$|R

40|$|Chrysanthemum morifolium is an {{important}} floral crop that is cultivated worldwide. However, {{due to a lack}} of genomic resources, very little information is available concerning the molecular mechanisms of flower development in chrysanthemum. The transcriptomes of chrysanthemum vegetative <b>buds,</b> <b>floral</b> <b>buds</b> and buds were sequenced using Illumina paired-end sequencing technology. A total of 15. 4 Gb of reads were assembled into 91, 367 unigenes with an average length of 739 bp. A total of 43, 137 unigenes showed similarity to known proteins in the Swissprot or NCBI non-redundant protein databases. Additionally, 25, 424, 24, 321 and 13, 704 unigenes were assigned to 56 gene ontology (GO) categories, 25 EuKaryotic Orthologous Groups (KOG) categories, and 285 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, respectively. A total of 1, 876 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (1, 516 up-regulated, 360 down-regulated) were identified between vegetative <b>buds</b> and <b>floral</b> <b>buds,</b> and 3, 300 DEGs (1, 277 up-regulated, 1, 706 down-regulated) were identified between <b>floral</b> <b>buds</b> and buds.

40|$|In Torenia stem {{segments}} cultured on {{a defined}} medium from which ammonium nitrate and growth regulators were omitted, adventitious buds were readily formed from epidermal tissue, with subsequent differentiation of floral buds. Using this plant material, {{the correlation between}} the time of application of various chemicals and the time-course of <b>floral</b> <b>bud</b> differentiation was investigated. Histological examination showed that adventitious buds were vegetative during {{the first two weeks of}} the culture, and floral primordia appeared after about three to four weeks of culture. We divided the flowering process in Torenia stem segments into the following 3 phases: the first phase (first 2 weeks) during which adventitious buds are formed, the second phase (3 rd and 4 th weeks) during which floral buds are initiated and the third phase (5 th to 12 th weeks) during which floral buds develop. Then we added IAA, zeatin, ammonium nitrate or a high concentration of sucrose to the medium during one, two or three of these phases. Ammonium nitrate added during the third phase suppressed <b>floral</b> <b>bud</b> de-velopment, but the high concentration of sucrose given during this phase stimulated it. These two chemicals influenced only the development of floral buds previously initiated. The application of IAA during the first phase promoted both the initiation and develop-ment of floral buds. However, its application after 2 weeks of culture failed to promote <b>floral</b> <b>bud</b> formation.

40|$|Pak choi (Brassica rapa ssp. chinensis Makino) is a {{representative}} seed vernalization vegetable and premature bolting in spring can cause significant economic loss. Thus, {{it is critical}} to elucidate the mechanism of molecular regulation of vernalization and <b>floral</b> <b>bud</b> initiation to prevent premature bolting. Gibberellin (GA) is the key plant hormone involved in regulating plant development. To {{gain a better understanding of}} GA metabolism in pak choi, the content of GA in pak choi was measured at different stages of plant development using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results showed that the GA content increased significantly after low-temperature treatment (4 °C) and then decreased rapidly with vegetative growth. During <b>floral</b> <b>bud</b> initiation, the GA content increased rapidly until it peaked upon <b>floral</b> <b>bud</b> differentiation. To elucidate these changes in GA content, the expression of homologous genes encoding enzymes directly involved in GA metabolism were analyzed. The results showed that the changes in the expression of four genes involved in GA synthesis (Bra 035120 encoding ent-kaurene synthase, Bra 009868 encoding ent-kaurene oxidase, Bra 015394 encoding ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase, and Bra 013890 encoding GA 20 -oxidase) were correlated with the changes in GA content.

No effect of photoperiod on the growth and development from emergence to the first true leaf was observed. The critical photoperiod for days from first true leaf to first bud for the lines are as follows: PI 217925 - 1 - 1, Mesa, and Mills are between 14 and 15 hours, Kinman and SEAH- 90 are between 13 and 14 hours, and PI 217925 - 2 is between 12 and 13 hours.
