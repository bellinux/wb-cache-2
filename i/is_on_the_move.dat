2500|$|The kettuvallams were {{traditionally}} used as grain barges, {{to transport}} the rice harvested in the fertile fields alongside the backwaters.

Converted to accommodate tourists, the houseboats have become floating cottages having a sleeping area, with western-style toilets, a dining area and a sit out on the deck. Most tourists spend the night on a houseboat. Food is cooked on board by the accompanying staff – mostly having a flavour of Kerala. The houseboats are of various patterns and can be hired as per the size of the family or visiting group. The living-dining room is usually open on at least three sides providing a grand view of the surroundings, including other boats, throughout the day when it <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>move.</b> It is brought to a standstill at times of taking food and at night.
