40|$|Through field {{research}} of typical villages and towns in China's northern cold region, this paper research energy consumption and resource {{recovery in the}} process of village and town <b>garbage</b> collection and <b>disposal</b> and organizes current situation and problems of village and town <b>garbage</b> collection and <b>disposal.</b> At present, village and town <b>garbage</b> collection and <b>disposal</b> means and thoughts are traditional and lag behind in China's northern cold region. There is the lack of <b>garbage</b> collection and <b>disposal</b> mode suitable for cold villages and towns. Thus, village and town resources are not effectively utilized, and residents’ living environment is affected continuously. This paper selects two mature <b>garbage</b> <b>disposal</b> methods: sanitary landfill and incineration power generation. Meanwhile, energy consumption and ultimate emission utilization of two schemes in <b>garbage</b> collection and <b>disposal</b> links are overall compared to propose <b>garbage</b> collection and <b>disposal</b> mode with low energy consumption suitable for green villages and towns in cold region. Besides, various control indexes of village and town <b>garbage</b> <b>disposal</b> schemes are explained in detail in combination of specific conditions...|$|R
