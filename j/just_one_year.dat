5|$|In 1773, Barbauld {{brought out}} {{her first book}} of poems, after her friends had praised them and {{convinced}} her to publish. The collection, entitled simply Poems, went through four editions in <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>year</b> and surprised Barbauld by its success. Barbauld became a respected literary figure in England on the reputation of Poems alone. The same year she and her brother, John Aikin, jointly published Miscellaneous Pieces in Prose, which was also well received. The essays in it (most of which were by Barbauld) were favourably compared to Samuel Johnson's.|$|E

He was sent to Kelly Field, near San Antonio, Texas, and then to McAllen, Texas. As commander of the 8th Aero Squadron, he flew reconnaissance missions {{along the border with}} Mexico during the Mexican Revolution.

5|$|A French edition, {{translated}} by M. L. Carion (or by Louise Swanton-Belloc? (1796–1881)), appeared by 1853 published in Cambrai and in Paris. By 1857, the novel had {{been translated into}} 20 languages, including two independent translations into Slovene <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>year</b> after its original publication, which started the since-then uninterrupted dialogue between American authors and Slovene translators and readers. Later, it was translated into almost every major language, including Chinese (with translator Lin Shu creating the first Chinese translation of an American novel in 1901) and Amharic (with the 1930 translation created in support of Ethiopian efforts to end the suffering of blacks in that nation). The book was so widely read that Sigmund Freud reported a number of patients with sado-masochistic tendencies who he believed had been influenced by reading about the whipping of slaves in Uncle Tom's Cabin.|$|E
5|$|A herbivore, the bohor reedbuck prefers {{grasses and}} tender reed shoots with high protein and low fiber content. This reedbuck is {{dependent}} on water, though green pastures can fulfill its water requirement. The social structure of the bohor reedbuck is highly flexible. Large aggregations are observed during the dry season, when hundreds of bohor reedbuck assemble near a river. Males become sexually mature {{at the age of}} three to four years, while females can conceive at <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>year</b> of age, reproducing every nine to fourteen months. Though there is no fixed breeding season, mating peaks in the rainy season. The gestation period is seven and a half months long, after which a single calf is born. The calves are weaned at eight to nine months of age.|$|E

5|$|According to Beesley, {{many have}} written that {{interest}} in the Deseret alphabet died with Brigham Young. This, however, isn't true; the alphabet was already regarded as a failure during Young's time. Only 500 copies of the full Book of Mormon translated into the Deseret alphabet sold for US$2 each, and even Young realized that the venture was too expensive {{and even the most}} devout Mormons could not be convinced to purchase and study the Deseret edition books over the books in the traditional orthography. In the winter of 1870, <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>year</b> after their publication, advertisements for the Deseret alphabet books were quietly removed from the Deseret News.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of their victory, Plymouth Argyle {{returned}} to the third tier of English football <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>year</b> after being relegated to the fourth tier {{for the first time in}} its history. They returned to the Third Division two years later before being promoted as champions in 2002, and the club followed that up by winning the Second Division in 2004, to reclaim their place in the second tier of English football after a twelve-year hiatus. For Darlington, there was to be more disappointment in the play-offs four years later under David Hodgson, Platt's successor. They reached the Third Division final in 2000, the last to be played at the original Wembley Stadium, and were defeated 10 again; on this occasion to Peterborough United.|$|E
5|$|Edwards joined Rochdale on loan {{until the}} end of the 2011–12 season in March 2012.

5|$|In 1907, Ipswich became {{founder members}} of the Southern Amateur League. The club {{narrowly}} avoided relegation {{in many of the}} following seasons, and suffered a club record 15–1 defeat {{at the hands of the}} Corinthians at Portman Road on New Year's Day, 1910. The outbreak of the First World War and the commandeering of Portman Road by the Army curtailed the 1914–15 season and organised football did not return until the 1920–21 season. <b>Just</b> <b>one</b> <b>year</b> later, Ipswich Town became champions of the Southern Amateur League, clinching the title on the last day of the season. The club won the league a further three times, in 1929–30, 1932–33 and 1933–34, before becoming founder {{members of the}} Eastern Counties Football League at the end of the 1934–35 season.|$|E
5|$|Kamianets-Podilskyi Castle {{played an}} {{important}} role during the Khmelnytsky Uprising between 1648–54, when the Zaporozhian Cossacks led by Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky, allied themselves with the Crimean Tatars and the local Ukrainian peasantry against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's army and militia. During the uprising, the castle was unsuccessfully besieged by local Cossacks and insurgents led by Commander Maksym Kryvonis. In 1651, the castle was then subject to another Cossack siege led by Hetman Ivan Bohun, before an unexpected counterattack by Polish insurgents under commanders Aleksandrenka and Chuika re-established the Polish presence in the area and relieved the siege. A 60,000 force army led by Khmelnytsky himself reasserted Cossack control over the castle in 1652. <b>Just</b> <b>one</b> <b>year</b> later, the castle was attacked yet again, this time by a 40,000 strong Crimean Tatar horde.|$|E

The UN Security Council passed Resolution 1268 on 15 October, instructing United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan to update the Security Council {{to the situation in}} Angola every three months. Dos Santos offered an amnesty to UNITA militants on 11 November. By December, Chief of Staff General João de Matos said the Angolan Armed Forces had destroyed 80% of UNITA's militant wing and captured 15,000tons of military equipment. Following the dissolution of the coalition government, Savimbi retreated to his historical base in Moxico and prepared for battle. In order to isolate UNITA, the government forced civilians in countryside areas subject to UNITA influence to relocate to major cities. The strategy was successful isolating in UNITA but had adverse humanitarian consequences.|$|E

5|$|After {{graduating from}} Queen's in 1928, Wilfrid Eggleston began {{writing for the}} locally printed Lethbridge Herald.

Eggleston held Buchanan and his politics in high regard during his short stay at the publication. After <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>year</b> writing in Lethbridge, he became Ottawa correspondent for the Toronto Star in 1929, and witnessed significant political events in this position, including {{the passing of the}} Statute of Westminster in 1931 and the British Empire Economic Conference of 1932. He also began writing through the media agency Reuters in the late 1920s by means of a syndicated weekly newspaper column, with a selection of his political pieces featuring in Time Magazine and a plethora of other noted publications. By the time Eggleston had resigned from the Toronto Star in 1936, he had risen to become the newspaper's parliamentary correspondent; he'd finished reporting through Reuters within the same year.|$|E
5|$|Groza {{grew up in}} an {{athletic}} family in Martins Ferry, Ohio. He enrolled at Ohio State University on a scholarship in 1942, but after <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>year</b> in college, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and was sent to serve in World War II. Groza deployed as an army surgical technician in the Pacific theater, where he stayed until returning in 1946 to play for the Browns. Helped by Groza's kicking and play at offensive tackle, the Browns won the AAFC championship every year between 1946 and 1949, when the league disbanded and the Browns were absorbed by the more established NFL. Cleveland won the NFL championship in its first year in the league on a last-minute field goal by Groza. Groza set NFL records for field goals made in 1950, 1952 and 1953. Sporting News named him the league's Most Valuable Player in 1954, when the Browns won another championship. The team repeated as NFL champions in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Real Madrid has {{maintained}} the white shirt for its home kit {{throughout the history}} of the club. There was, however, one season that the shirt and shorts were not both white. It was an initiative undertaken by Escobal and Quesada in 1925; the two were traveling through England when they noticed the kit worn by London-based team Corinthian F.C., {{one of the most famous}} teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship. It was decided that Real Madrid would wear black shorts in an attempt to replicate the English team, but the initiative lasted <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>year.</b> After being eliminated from the cup by Barcelona with a 1–5 defeat in Madrid and a 2–0 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to an all-white kit, claiming that the other kit brought bad luck. By the early 1940s, the manager changed the kit again by adding buttons to the shirt and the club's crest on the left breast, which has remained ever since. On 23 November 1947, in a game against Atlético Madrid at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real Madrid became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts. English club Leeds United permanently switched their blue shirt for a white one in the 1960s, to emulate the dominant Real Madrid of the era.|$|E

5|$|The Anderson Street Station had a wood {{siding with}} a {{shingled}} roof, two brick chimneys {{off the roof}} and two asphalt platforms in both directions. The station also had a garage door on the southern side of the building.

Nearby, a wooden watchman's shanty was constructed near the team track. The station had two tracks run through it (one main track and a team track) and had a rail crossing between tracks. By 1870, the tracks had been extended northward to Hillsdale, and public service began on the line on March 4 of that year. Trains terminated at Hillsdale with fare of only $0.75 (1870 USD), but <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>year</b> later, the extension northward. The service was extended northward to the community of Haverstraw, New York, and in 1896, the rail line was leased by the private company to the Erie Railroad.|$|E
5|$|In 1819 Buenos Aires was at {{war with}} José Gervasio Artigas and Estanislao López, and {{requested}} San Martín and Belgrano to return with their armies {{to take part in}} the conflict. San Martín refused to do so, but Belgrano accepted. However, before his arrival the governors Estanislao López and Juan José Viamonte signed an eight-day truce to start peace negotiations. Belgrano's health was in a very bad state by this point, but he refused to resign, thinking that the morale of the Army would suffer without his presence. He moved to the frontier between Santa Fe and Córdoba, from where he would be able to move to either the litoral or the north if needed. His health continued to worsen, and he was given an unlimited leave from work by the Supreme Director. He handed command to Fernández de la Cruz and moved to Tucumán, where he met his daughter Manuela Mónica, <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>year</b> old. The governor of Tucuman, Feliciano de la Motta, was deposed during his stay, and Belgrano was taken prisoner. Abraham González led the uprising and attempted to put Belgrano into a shrew's fiddle, but Belgrano's doctor Josef Redhead objected, because of his delicate health, and his sentence was changed to simple imprisonment. When Bernabé Araoz took control of the government of Tucumán, Belgrano was immediately released.|$|E
