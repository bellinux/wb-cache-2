500|$|Rit {{struggled}} to keep her family together as slavery threatened to tear it apart. Edward Brodess sold three of her daughters (Linah, Mariah Ritty, and Soph), separating them from the family forever. When a trader from Georgia approached Brodess about buying Rit's youngest son, Moses, she hid him for a month, aided by other slaves and free blacks in the community. At one point she confronted her owner about the sale. Finally, Brodess and [...] "the Georgia man" [...] came toward the slave quarters to seize the child, where Rit told them, [...] "You are after my son; but the first man that comes <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>house,</b> I will split his head open." [...] Brodess backed away and abandoned the sale. Tubman's biographers agree that stories told about this event within the family influenced her belief in the possibilities of resistance.|$|E
2500|$|As {{an example}} of {{changing}} views on the subject, author Orson Scott Card (best known for the Enders Game series) once stated on his website, [...] "to write fiction using my characters is morally identical to moving <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> without invitation and throwing out my family." [...] He changed his mind completely and since has assisted fan fiction contests, arguing to the Wall Street Journal that [...] "Every piece of fan fiction is an ad for my book. What kind of idiot would I be to want that to disappear?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Debussy {{had long}} been fascinated by the stories of Edgar Allan Poe, {{familiar}} to French readers through the translations by Charles Baudelaire. As early as 1890, André Suarès {{wrote in a letter}} to Romain Rolland that [...] "Monsieur Claude Debussy... is working on a symphony that will unfold psychological ideas based on the stories of Poe, in particular, The Fall of the House of Usher." [...] Nothing came of this plan but in the wake of the success of his only completed opera, Pelléas et Mélisande in 1902, Debussy turned to Poe for material for a potential successor. He worked on his first attempt at a Poe-inspired opera, the comedy Le diable dans le beffroi, for several years before finally abandoning it in 1911 or 1912. By mid-June 1908 Debussy had begun another opera based on a Poe tale, the darker Fall of the House of Usher. On 5 July he signed a contract with the New York Metropolitan Opera guaranteeing the house the right to stage the premiere of his projected Poe double-bill as well as another unwritten opera La légende de Tristan. That summer he wrote to his friend Jacques Durand: [...] "These days I have been working hard on The Fall of the House of Usher...There are moments when I lose the feeling of things around me and if the sister of Roderick Usher were to come <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>house,</b> I shouldn't be very surprised." ...|$|E

60|$|Fron. I know nothing, {{but only}} that, by your master's order, I was {{to receive the}} two ladies <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>house,</b> and you {{prevented}} it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I call {{on all of}} you {{to witness}} that," [...] ses Bob, looking round. [...] "Henery Walker went <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>'ouse</b> to steal <b>my</b> hamper. He ses so, and it wasn't 'is fault he couldn't find it. I'm a pore man and I can't afford such things; I sold it this morning, a bargain, for thirty bob." ...|$|R
6000|$|But his kinsman was too {{launched}} to {{pull himself}} up. [...] "Wasn't it enough {{that you should have}} plotted against my rights? Need you have come <b>into</b> <b>my</b> very <b>house</b> to intrigue with my sister?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{forced himself}} <b>into</b> <b>my</b> father's <b>house</b> in Norfolk and obtained, either by force or craft, some {{valuable}} papers. My {{father was in}} delicate health, and we fear that the shock will cost him his reason." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Prevent their {{breaking}} <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> {{in order}} to drag you out of it," [...] he replied quietly; [...] "so, I pray you, do as I bid you." ...|$|E
5000|$|The fourth movement, [...] "" [...] (Come <b>into</b> <b>my</b> heart's <b>house)</b> is a soprano aria with a continuo ritornello. It is {{characterized}} by extensive melismas and a [...] "floating and ethereal" [...] melody. The continuo melody is taken also by the voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hugh," [...] said Mr. Clavering, rising {{slowly from}} his chair, [...] "I don't often come <b>into</b> <b>my</b> father's <b>house,</b> but when I do, I {{wish to be}} treated with respect. You are the only person in this parish that ever omits to do so." ...|$|R
6000|$|As he spoke, {{the door}} opened again, and Lady Le Breton, {{attracted}} {{by the sound of}} angry voices, entered unexpectedly. 'What does all this riot mean, Herbert?' she asked, imperiously. 'Who on earth is this young woman that Ronald has brought <b>into</b> <b>my</b> own <b>house,</b> actually without <b>my</b> permission?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{you explain}} at once, sir," [...] Philippa demanded, [...] "what {{you mean by}} forcing your way <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> in this {{extraordinary}} fashion, and by locking that door?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I am ruined; {{we are all}} ruined. Oh! it was an evil {{hour when}} I took one of your bloodthirsty trade <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>house.</b> What have you to say?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{tell you}} how, exactly; but you brought {{something}} <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> {{that makes it}} warmer and pleasanter, and won't quite vanish, I hope, when you go away, my child." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I thank thee, neighbours, {{for your}} goodwill," [...] replied the glover. [...] "My {{daughter}} is ill at ease, {{and may not}} come forth into the cold night air; but if this gay gallant, whose voice methinks I should know, will go <b>into</b> <b>my</b> poor <b>house,</b> she will charge him with thanks {{for the rest of}} you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay," [...] {{said the}} Baron, [...] "I {{have come from}} death's door. But that is no matter. Wilt thou take this little babe <b>into</b> sanctuary? <b>My</b> <b>house</b> is a vile, rough place, and not fit for such as he, and his mother with the blessed saints in heaven." [...] And once more Conrad of Drachenhausen's face began {{twitching}} with the pain of his thoughts.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you bring}} so much heat <b>into</b> <b>my</b> poor <b>house,</b> learned Doctor, surely {{all of us}} will soon burn," [...] said Jacob suavely.

Come, come, drink a cup of wine and be calm." ...|$|R
6000|$|HIGGINS. I {{care for}} life, for humanity; {{and you are}} a part of it that has come my way and been built <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>house.</b> What more can you or anyone ask? ...|$|E
60|$|MRS TARLETON. [with a scream] Oh! and John {{encouraging}} him, I'll be bound! Bunny: {{you go for}} the police. [To Gunner] I'll {{teach you}} to come <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> and shoot my husband.|$|E
6000|$|Watkins: [...] "If I {{saw a man}} coming <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> with a load {{like this}} to-night, I'd throw him into the street. But living in a ninth-story flat like you, it might hurt him." ...|$|E
5000|$|... (5-15)--What have I {{done to the}} king, my lord?

[...] Seeing that, as far as I am concerned, neither my father nor my mother put me in this place, but the strong arm of the king2 brought me <b>into</b> <b>my</b> father's <b>house,</b> why should I of all people commit a crime against the king, my lord? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps, Mr. Fenwick, {{you will}} {{allow me to}} express my own ideas. The constabulary, I say, are of opinion {{that there is no}} manner of doubt {{that he was one of}} those who broke <b>into</b> <b>my</b> tenant's <b>house</b> on that fatal night; and, as I was {{explaining}} to Mr. Gilmore when you did us the honour to join us, in the course of a long provincial experience I have seldom known the police to be in error." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hullo," [...] said Ukridge, [...] "Beale has a dog." [...] He frowned, annoyed. [...] "What right," [...] {{he added}} in an aggrieved tone, [...] "has a beastly mongrel, {{belonging}} to a man I employ, to keep me out of <b>my</b> own <b>house?</b> It's a little hard. Here am I, slaving day and night to support Beale, and when I try to get <b>into</b> <b>my</b> own <b>house</b> his infernal dog barks at me. Upon my Sam it's hard!" [...] He brooded {{for a moment on}} the injustice of things. [...] "Here, let me get to the keyhole. I'll reason with the brute." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Chester," [...] she said, as tranquilly as if {{about to}} ask him the most {{ordinary}} question in the world, [...] "why did you climb <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> last night and try to steal my money?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{all very}} well," [...] he said, [...] "but I don't want to bribe people <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> with {{shooting}} and good cooking, and nursing their blooming foxes. That ain't {{my idea of}} making friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now!' {{said the}} hump-backed man, who had watched him keenly, 'what {{do you mean}} by coming <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>house,</b> in this violent way? Do you want to rob me, or to murder me? Which is it?' ...|$|E
60|$|It {{is not to}} {{be denied}} that I made <b>my</b> entry <b>into</b> <b>my</b> son-in-law's <b>house</b> in a {{disturbed}} and irritated frame of mind. First, my temper was tried by the almost interminable journey, in the noisy and comfortless vehicle which they call a cab, from the river-wharf to the west-end of London, where Marmaduke lives. In the second place, I was scandalized and alarmed by an incident which took place--still on the endless journey from east to west--in a street hard by the market of Covent Garden.|$|R
60|$|The wind {{must have}} blown the {{building}} from its foundations, and upon the slippery {{surface of the}} hillside, probably lashed into liquid mud by the pouring rain, it was making its way down toward the valley! In a flash my mind's eye ran over the whole surface of the country beneath me as far as I knew it. I was almost positive {{that there was no}} precipice, no terrible chasm <b>into</b> which <b>my</b> <b>house</b> might fall. There was nothing but sloping hillside, and beneath that a wide stretch of fields.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Noisey, Mendler said [...] "we went through a ton of ideas and when I first got Allie's treatment, her fresh perspective was undeniable. I told her I had my heart set on working with her and from there we found a concept that had dark, satirical, plus heart-aching moments. I break <b>into</b> <b>my</b> ex's <b>house</b> and try to recreate our lost love while he is passed out. Even {{in the midst of}} fun and light moments in life, my heart is as limp as his hand hitting my knee while we dance in the kitchen." ...|$|R
