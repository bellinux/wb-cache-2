5|$|Like {{other land}} animals that {{have adapted to}} life in a marine environment, sea snakes ingest {{considerably}} more salt than their terrestrial relatives through their <b>diets,</b> <b>and</b> when seawater is inadvertently swallowed. This meant they had to evolve a more effective means of regulating the salt concentration of their blood. In sea snakes, the posterior sublingual glands, located under and around the tongue sheath, evolved {{to allow them to}} expel salt with their tongue action.|$|E

5|$|Although rodents {{have been}} {{regarded}} traditionally as herbivores, {{a number of}} species opportunistically include insects, fish, or meat in their <b>diets</b> <b>and</b> more specialized forms rely on such foods. A functional-morphological study of the rodent tooth system supports the idea that primitive rodents were omnivores rather than herbivores. Studies of the literature show that numerous members of the Sciuromorpha and Myomorpha, and {{a few members of}} the Hystricomorpha, have either included animal matter in their diets or been prepared to eat such food when offered it in captivity. Examination of the stomach contents of the North American white-footed mouse, normally considered to be herbivorous, showed 34% animal matter.|$|E
5|$|Food webs {{are often}} limited {{relative}} to the real world. Complete empirical measurements are generally restricted to a specific habitat, such as a cave or a pond, and principles gleaned from food web microcosm studies are extrapolated to larger systems.

5|$|Traditional hunters {{used all}} parts of the walrus.

5|$|Johansson {{has criticized}} {{the media for}} {{promoting}} an image that causes unhealthy <b>diets</b> <b>and</b> eating disorders among women, believing that being skinny is not attractive. In one article she wrote for HuffPost, Johansson encouraged the reader to maintain a healthy body. She appeared nude {{on the cover of}} the March 2006 issue of Vanity Fair alongside actress Keira Knightley and fully clothed fashion designer Tom Ford. This caused some controversy as it was believed the photo demonstrated that women are forced to flaunt their sexuality more often than men. In September 2011, nude photographs of Johansson hacked from her cell phone were published online. Following an FBI investigation, the perpetrator was arrested, pled guilty, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Johansson said the photos had been sent to her then-husband, Reynolds, three years before the incident. In 2014, Johansson won a lawsuit against French publisher, JC Lattès, for using her name and featuring a look-alike model of her in the novel The First Thing We Look At by Gregoire Delacourt. Johansson was awarded $3,400, a fraction of the $68,000 she had claimed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this work, {{we present}} a {{mathematical}} model for the dynamics of glucose regulatory system under the combined use of <b>dieting</b> <b>and</b> physical activity, the model is an improvement on the work by Brian et al (2000). In our proposed model, we incorporated a parameter h by defining itin terms of; physical activity <b>and</b> <b>dieting</b> (calorie restriction) as factors that affects glucose and insulin homeostasis. The study ushered in a mathematical model for studying {{the dynamics of the}} glucose regulation under the combined effect of <b>dieting</b> (calorie restriction) <b>and</b> physical activity. The model was used to investigate the effect of <b>dieting</b> <b>and</b> physical activity on glucose and insulin homeostasis, The result of the study showed that; <b>dieting</b> <b>and</b> physical activity has great impact on the regulation of plasma glucose and insulin concentration, <b>and</b> that <b>dieting</b> <b>and</b> physical activity can be used on any population for the management of glucose and insulin homeostasis.
