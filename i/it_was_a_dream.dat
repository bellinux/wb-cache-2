25|$|At Roadblock: End of the Line, Charlotte Flair {{defeated}} Sasha Banks to win {{her record}} fourth Raw Women's Championship, ending their long feud and, as per a post-event stipulation, {{as long as one}} of them were champion, the other could not challenge for the title. Charlotte then began a feud with Bayley, which resulted in a championship match at the Royal Rumble, where Charlotte retained. Also during this time, Sasha entered into a feud with Nia Jax, who defeated Sasha on the Royal Rumble pre-show. The next night on Raw, Bayley pinned Charlotte in a six-person mixed tag team match, thus granting her a rematch for the title on the February 13 episode of Raw, where she defeated Charlotte to become the new Raw Women's Champion, thanks to help from Sasha. The following week, Raw Commissioner Stephanie McMahon asked Bayley to relinquish her title due to Sasha's interference, but Bayley refused and Charlotte invoked her championship rematch for Fastlane, which saw Bayley retain after Sasha, who had just defeated Jax, again interfered, which subsequently ended Charlotte's undefeated streak in singles matches at pay-per-view events. The following night on Raw, Sasha said that she and Bayley should face off for the title at WrestleMania 33 as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> of theirs to face each other at the event. Charlotte came out and demanded that she should have a rematch due to Sasha's interference and said that Sasha interfered due to the Roadblock stipulation. Raw General Manager Mick Foley then scheduled Charlotte to face Sasha in which the winner would challenge Bayley for the title at WrestleMania. However, Stephanie decided to keep Charlotte in the championship match at WrestleMania, but allowed Sasha the opportunity {{to be added to the}} match if she could defeat Bayley that night, which she did. The following week, Sasha defeated Charlotte's ally Dana Brooke, whom Charlotte had ordered to take out Sasha. Charlotte then fired and insulted Dana, who attacked Charlotte in retaliation. Nia Jax was also given the opportunity to challenge for the championship at WrestleMania if she could defeat Bayley. However, Nia lost the match by disqualification as she kept attacking Bayley beyond the referee's five count, but the following week, Nia defeated Bayley in a rematch that was no disqualification, earning her a spot in the championship match at WrestleMania. The following week prior to Raw, the match was turned into a fatal four-way elimination match. On Raw, Bayley and Sasha teamed up and defeated Charlotte and Nia. After the match, Nia laid out her three WrestleMania opponents.|$|E

Sepinwall wrote that the [...] "only way the strangulation scene would have been acceptable to me was with the understanding going in that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream.</b> Had the show not telegraphed that — or had I not figured it out — and Don woke up the next morning with no corpse on the floor, I'd have been irked." [...] One writer for Paste Magazine noted that the [...] "brilliantly shot" [...] episode had a [...] "Hitchcockian feel", and pointed to the use of [...] "reverse point-of-view shots" [...] and [...] "close-ups of hands on doorknobs that added an air of suspense not usually present on Mad Men." [...] Eric Goldman of IGN declared it the [...] "best episode yet for Season 5, with some very good material for Joan, Peggy, Don and Sally packed into a busy hour." [...] Goldman praised the resolution to the Harris marriage, crediting Weiner with mastering [...] "the slow burn on this show, and it was just so gratifying to finally have this issue be dealt with." ...|$|E
