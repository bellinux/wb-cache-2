500|$|I {{remember}} {{not just}} because it was a win, but also because it was a big fight right into the last night. Fabrizia reminded me the other night that we had a problem with the brake pads, so we lost a lot of time. We finished three days rallying (with one day to go), night and day, 32 seconds in front of Ari Vatanen. We drove the last special stage for the night, came back to the hotel and I could not sleep at all, four hours in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> no sleep. Then I arrive at the special stage, it's about 42km long, and I look at Fabrizia and I said [...] "OK, we forget everything, and we are at the first stage of the rally again, because one of us will crash." [...] And so Ari hit a rock, and we won the rally.|$|E
500|$|The Times {{gave the}} game four stars {{out of five}} {{and said it was}} [...] "more for 24 fans, who will {{instantly}} love it — so long as they don’t mind another TV addiction to feed." [...] The Sydney Morning Herald gave it three-and-a-half stars out of five, stating, [...] "Newcomers to the trials and tribulations of Jack Bauer are unlikely to be impressed by this game's generic shooting and driving action. But fans of 24 will be quaking, thanks to the authentic atmosphere and gripping story, set between season two and three of the TV series." [...] However, The A.V. Club gave it a C and stated that [...] "For once, you'll wish you could skip the action to get to the cutscenes." [...] Detroit Free Press gave it a similar score of two stars out of four and said: [...] "The controls are just too unpolished to make it worthwhile, though. Movements are flaky, and aiming is far too loose. Sometimes, I got into a tight firefight where I couldn't hit a terrorist a few feet in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>me.</b> <b>And</b> the driving missions are worse." ...|$|E

500|$|As the {{defending}} champion at the World Championship for the first time, O'Sullivan sought to turn his recent bad form around and break the Crucible curse. O'Sullivan defeated Drew Henry 10–5 in the first round, Robert Milkins 13–2 in the second round, and Stephen Lee 13–10 in the quarter-finals {{to advance to the}} semi-finals where he faced Stephen Hendry. In a pre-match interview, O'Sullivan revealed that he had [...] "no respect" [...] for Hendry, referring to an incident during O'Sullivan's 13–17 semi-final defeat to Hendry three years prior, when the referee had awarded a miss that O'Sullivan felt Hendry should not have accepted. He further added that he wanted [...] "to send [...] back home to Scotland" [...] to stop one of his former manager's players from winning the tournament, and that [...] "I know if I do get beat and [...] comes up and does a moonie in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> goes 'Ne ne ne', I'll just look at him and say 'well done' and say 'go back to your sad little life'.". In the match O'Sullivan took a 5–3 overnight lead after the first session, but Hendry fought back to level at 12–12 before the final session. Hendry subsequently outplayed O'Sullivan winning the semi-final 17 frames to 13. After the match, Hendry said it wasn't [...] "personal" [...] for him and he didn't remember the incident O'Sullivan described. O'Sullivan was unapologetic about the comments he made, saying it made a [...] "better atmosphere" [...] and [...] "what's better than a grudge match?".|$|E

After switching majors, he {{graduated with a}} B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering, and obtained a full-time job in LISP compiler development at Lucid Inc., with several future Loud Family bandmates. Of this period, Miller stated {{in an interview that}} his employers [...] "let me go whenever I have to do band stuff, which is very big of them." [...] Miller described his job situation as [...] "kind of a carrot in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> a boot behind me," [...] acknowledging that his engineering work was highly paid, and noting his need to make a living.|$|E
2500|$|I {{was walking}} {{about in a}} town which I did not know. [...] I saw streets and squares which were strange to me. [...] Then I came into a house where I lived, went to my room, and found a letter from Mother lying there. [...] She wrote saying that as I had left home without my parents' {{knowledge}} she had not wished to write to me to say Father was ill. [...] "Now he is dead, and if you like you can come." [...] I {{then went to the}} station and asked about a hundred times: [...] "Where is the station?" [...] I always got the answer: [...] "Five minutes." [...] I then saw a thick wood before me which I went into, and there I asked a man whom I met. [...] He said to me: [...] "Two and a half hours more." [...] He offered to accompany me. [...] But I refused and went alone. I saw the station in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> could not reach it. [...] At the same time, I had the unusual feeling of anxiety that one has in dreams when one cannot move forward. Then I was at home. I must have been travelling in the meantime, but I knew nothing about that. I walked into the porter's lodge, and enquired for our flat. The maidservant opened the door to me and replied that Mother and the others were already at the cemetery.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997 {{the band}} {{recorded}} Musical Monkey, an album which captured their chaotic energy and sharp sense of humor. It {{is considered by}} many to be the best representation of their [...] "classic" [...] sound, and songs such as [...] "Lucky the Donkey," [...] "Do the Hustle," [...] "Lipstick" [...] and [...] "Perfect World" [...] became staples in their live set. The following year they released Live From the Pharmacy, a recording of a live show from 1994 that also included four new songs engineered by Vandals guitarist Warren Fitzgerald and liner notes written by Nunn recounting the band’s history. In 1998 Guttermouth was banned from performing in Canada for one year on charges of public indecency after Adkins exposed himself onstage in Saskatoon. According to Adkins: [...] "oh, I was guilty [...] What I would do is grab two young girls out of the audience and I would have them hold up this sheet in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> Jamie, the drummer at the time, would say this magical incantation, if you will, and I would be standing there stark naked." [...] Combined with a drunk driving charge from the United States, the incident led Adkins to be arrested on immigration charges, detained for five days, and then deported, though Guttermouth would return to Canada a few years later. After obtaining a full pardon from the Canadian judicial system known as the crown. No record remains on file.|$|E

2500|$|The band {{expected}} a less personal {{treatment for the}} film and were at times uncomfortable with {{the extent to which}} Guggenheim probed into their history.

My process strips layers away. Rock stars are more comfortable creating an aura and mystique." [...] Despite U2's discomfort, they allowed Guggenheim to have creative control over the film. He remarked, [...] "They said from the beginning, we want you to make the movie that you want to make <b>and</b> they let <b>me</b> make the movie I wanted to make. It was pretty astounding. I think part of it is the trust we gained doing It Might Get Loud, they sort <b>of</b> let <b>me</b> have a free hand." [...] Bono said that it was the least involved the band had ever been in a U2 project. Additional filming took place on 27 May at Burton Cummings Theatre in Winnipeg during the band's rehearsals for the Glastonbury Festival 2011. A rough cut of the movie was shown to the group in July, much to their satisfaction. According to Guggenheim, [...] "They were over the moon. They loved it." [...] The only request the band made was that the film should be shortened in length, and Guggenheim agreed.|$|R
