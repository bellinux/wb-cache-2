40|$|Attention-deficit–hyperactivity {{disorder}} (ADHD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common childhood psychiatric disorders, estimated to affect 5 – 10 % of school-aged children worldwide. 1 According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders – <b>Fourth</b> <b>Edition</b> – <b>Text</b> <b>Revision</b> (DSM-IV-TR), 2 ADHD is defined by a persistent and age-inappropriate pattern of inattention, hyperactivity–impulsivity or both. Onset before the age of seven years and impaired functioning in two or more settings are required for the diagnosis. Impairing symptoms of ADHD may persist into adulthood in up to 60 % of cases. 3 Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder characterised by an irresistible urge to move the legs, which is often accompanied by uncomfortable sensations in the legs or, less frequently, other body parts. These sensations are relieved by movement and are worse in the evening or night and when resting. The diagnosis of RLS is based on the revised criteria developed by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG). 4 Although RLS has traditionally been considered to be a disorder of middle to older age, several case reports have shown that it may occur in childhood. 5 However, children may report RLS symptoms differently from adults, in part because of their limited ability to describe RLS sensations. In addition, the clinical presentation of RLS may differ in children. Considering these particularities, the IRLSSG has proposed a set of criteria specific to children. 4 Polysomnographically, RLS may be associated with periodic limb movements in sleep (PLMS) in about 80 % of patients, in both adults and children. 4 PLMS are defined as movements that occur in series of four or more, lasting between half a second and five seconds, have an amplitude of one-quarter or more of the toe dorsiflexion during calibration and are separated by intervals of four to 90 seconds. RLS per se and/or associated PLMS may lead to significant sleep fragmentation. Therefore, RLS is a recognised, although sometimes overlooked, cause of insomni...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} caffeine use in different types of eating disorders (ED) patients either using a categorical approach [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - <b>Fourth</b> <b>Edition</b> - <b>Text</b> <b>Revision</b> (DSM-IV-TR) diagnostic criteria] or a dimensional perspective. METHOD: Fifty-eight ED female patients [anorexia nervosa (AN), restricting and binge-eating/purging type, N= 15; bulimia nervosa (BN) purging type/nonpurging type, N= 26; binge eating disorder (BED), N= 17] referred to an Eating Disorder Unit and 15 non-clinical controls were administered the Eating Disorder Inventory- 2 (EDI- 2), the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and the Caffeine Use Test, an interview specifically developed to investigate caffeine intake. Statistical analyses were then repeated clustering patients according to the presence/absence of purging behaviors (purgers, N= 22; non-purgers, N= 19; BED, N= 17). RESULTS: Current and lifetime caffeine use, measured as mg/day, were similar comparing controls and ED patients as a whole. BN patients showed a significantly higher maximum lifetime caffeine intake (817. 4 +/- 528, 9 vs 325. 0 +/- 294. 6 mg/die, F= 3. 246, p< 0. 05); the same for purgers vs controls (p< 0. 05). Caffeine abuse was significantly more represented among patients vs controls (p< 0. 01), but similar among different patients' groups. As for diagnoses according to DSM-IV-TR Substance Use modified for caffeine, no significant difference was found among the different groups, for either Dependence, Intoxication or Withdrawal. Most of patients and controls reported pleasure as the main motivation for caffeine use, followed by increased vigilance and attention and appetite suppression in AN and BN patients. Note that a shift in diagnosis in the course of the ED from non-purging to purging type was associated with an increase in caffeine current, lifetime and maximum lifetime intake (F= 1. 667 p< 0. 05), except for BED patients. Severity of the ED measured as CGI score or comorbidity did not affect caffeine intake in patients as a whole, but in the purging subgroup current caffeine use was increased in presence of an anxiety disorder (p< 0. 05), and decreased in presence of a mood disorder (p< 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Data from the present study are in agreement with previous evidence in literature that a high percentage of ED patients ordinarily use caffeine with an average intake similar to that of the general population, however with a kind of binge attitude. Among heavy drinkers, daily caffeine intake and alcohol/cigarettes use are associated supporting the link with the dimension of impulse disregulation. The substantial number of subjects from our sample satisfying research criteria for Dependence, together with increasing reports of caffeine intoxication, suggests the growing relevance of these issues that deserve further investigation...|$|R

40|$|Pathological {{gambling}} (PG) is {{a chronic}} and progressive condition, defined as “persistent and recurrent maladaptive gambling behaviour”; {{it is currently}} classified among the Impulse control disorders (Not Elsewhere Classified) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders – <b>Fourth</b> <b>Edition</b> - <b>Text</b> <b>Revision</b> (DSM-IV-TR). The diagnostic criteria for PG resemble those of both Substance use disorders (SUDs) and Compulsive disorders (in particular, Obsessive compulsive disorder [OCD]). The terms compulsivity and impulsivity are interchangeably used to describe difficulties in self-control leading to repetitive psychopathological behaviours; nonetheless, they represent two distinct constructs. Compulsive behaviours are driven by “a tendency to perform unpleasantly repetitive acts in a habitual or stereotyped manner to prevent perceived negative consequences, leading to functional impairment”, whereas impulsivity {{has been described as}} “a predisposition toward rapid, unplanned reactions to internal or external stimuli with diminished regard to the negative consequences of these reactions to the impulsive individual or others”. Features of both compulsivity and impulsivity are involved in PG phenomenology, and a large body of literature investigated these aspects mainly making use of clinical observation and results obtained through self-report questionnaires. PG can be conceptualized as a compulsive-impulsive spectrum disorder or as a behavioural addiction: these two theoretical frameworks have been proposed for PG categorization in DSM- 5, thus and understanding which of them is better suited to PG symptoms is relevant for diagnostic classification issues. Although these two approaches are not mutually exclusive, adopting one rather than the other has important clinical implications. Recently, the importance of integrating phenotypic (i. e. phenomenological) and endophenotypic (i. e. behavioural/physiological) indicators in psychodiagnostic assessment has been highlighted. Endophenotypes are measures of the individual neuropsychological, neurophysiological and biochemical functioning, and consequently anomalies in endophenotypes are supposed to reflect impairments in the underlying neurocognitive processes. Impairments in motor inhibition ability and difficulties in delaying gratification and decision making, which are prefrontally-mediated cognitive functions, have been suggested to underlie problems in behavioural regulation (i. e. compulsive and impulsive behaviours). From this perspective, both compulsive and impulsive behaviours would represent: a. the performance of an action before its complete processing or the failure of interrupting already activated actions; b. a dysfunction in behavioural choices, which are perpetrated despite bad consequences for the individual. Therefore, cognitive measures of motor inhibition and decision making abilities may represent promising endophenotipic indicators of behavioural regulation, and deficits in these functions are hypothesized to underpin PG, OCD, and SUDs. The present dissertation was conducted {{in the light of the}}se considerations, and following the recommendation that directly comparing PGs with OCD patients and individuals with SUDs can represent a viable way to identify the most suitable classification for PG. A group of treatment-seeking PGs was compared with patients with OCD, Alcohol dependents (ADs) and healthy controls (HCs) on both self-report questionnaires and cognitive measures of compulsivity and impulsivity. The main aims were to investigate similarities and differences between clinical groups in such measures, as well as potentially different patterns of response in cognitive tasks. The Go/Nogo task was used to assess motor inhibition ability, whereas the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) was administered to evaluate decision making processes. A preliminary comparison between small groups of PGs and croupiers on the same measures was also conducted; croupiers were chosen as gambling represents a relevant activity for both groups of individuals, and also in the light of the higher risks of developing problem or pathological gambling observed in casino employees than in general population. Consequently, the study of compulsivity and impulsivity in croupiers may be helpful in identifying the factors potentially involved in the development of PG. The main results showed that PGs reported higher levels of both self-reported compulsivity and impulsivity than healthy individuals. Furthermore, a number of similarities between PGs, OCD patients and ADs in the phenotypic measures of both dimensions was observed. No evidence of impaired motor inhibition ability in PGs, OCD patients or ADs emerged. In regards to decision making processes, deficits in the IGT performance were found in PGs and ADs, whereas OCD patients did as good as HCs. Both PGs and ADs were characterized by a decline of their performance towards the end of the task, which indicated difficulties in the maintenance of learning to shift from disadvantageous to advantageous decisions. The comparison between PGs and croupiers revealed that the former obtained higher scores on measures of compulsivity, whereas the latter did not differ from HCs. However, both PGs and croupiers reported similar and higher self-reported impulsivity than HCs. As regards the cognitive tasks, no significant difference between groups emerged; nonetheless, IGT profiles of learning showed that PGs had a poor performance and croupiers differed from HCs in that they did not improve in the last block of the task. Several conclusions may be drawn from present results. First of all, data from self-report measures suggest that both the compulsive-impulsive spectrum hypothesis and the behavioural addiction one might be adequate for PG categorization, as compulsivity and impulsivity co-occur in PGs. Furthermore, the numerous analogies emerged between PGs, OCD patients and ADs further support to include the three of them in a common spectrum of disorders. On the other hand, IGT findings highlighted the presence of similar deficits in PGs and ADs. This result is in line with literature reporting dysfunctions in the brain circuitry underlying decision making ability, and therefore it supports the conceptualization of PG as an addictive disorder. Data emerged from the comparison between PGs and croupiers seem also to be consistent with this hypothesis, as probable vulnerability factors for addictions (i. e. impulsivity personality trait and potentially altered decision making processes) have been observed also in healthy individuals at risk for the development of PG. However, given the small samples sizes further studies are recommended. To conclude, results from the present dissertation indicate that both classifications are equally appropriate for PG, depending on the adopted indicators. Other studies are required to further clarify which is the best diagnostic category for PG...|$|R

Results: Our study revealed: (a) sex distribution among the patient group with male/female ratio 6. 5 : 1; (b) mean value of maternal age was significantly higher among patients than controls; (c) about 50 % of patients had a history of prenatal complication; (d) the patient group shows lower plasma level of TGFβ 1 compared to the control group. Conclusion: There may be an important role for the immune system in autism spectrum disorders that may have profound implications for diagnosis and treatment of this disorder. A negative correlation was found between severities of ASD and TGFβ 1 plasma level...|$|R
