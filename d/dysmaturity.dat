40|$|Very {{little is}} known about the {{subsequent}} fate of infants who are dysmature at birth. The series of infants studied by Sjostedt, Engleson and Rooth (1958) offers an opportunity for a follow-up study which would disclose whether <b>dysmaturity</b> is only a term of significance in the neonatal period or also has relevance to the subsequent fate of the infant. As was shown in 1958 the dysmature infants, who were classified according to Clifford's Stages 0 to 3 (Sjostedt et al., 1958), differed from normal newborn infants in a number of parameters studied. Thus, in the cord blood, the mean oxygen saturation was lower in dysmature infants than in the controls, whereas haemoglobin concentration, plasma pen-toses, protein-bound hexoses, bilirubin and non-protein nitrogen was higher in the dysmature than in the control groups. Also the mean weight was lower in the dysmature group, and they showed an increased frequency of albuminuria and glycosuria during the first days of life. The differences were interpreted as signs of placental insufficiency, although there was no correlation between the stage of <b>dysmaturity</b> and the absolute or relative size of the placenta. As the number of cases of <b>dysmaturity</b> Stage 2 was sufficiently large for a statistical evaluation of the results these children were selected for a follow-up study and controls were matched with them. Material and Methods The mothers of the initial 41 cases of Stage 2 dys-matures were asked by letter whether they would par-ticipate in the follow-up study. The same applied to the four cases of Stage 3. Thirty-one Stage 2, and three Stage 3, agreed to participate. Controls were chosen from infants of <b>dysmaturity</b> Stage 0, of the same sex as the probands, whose mothers were of the same parity and approximately the same age-groups, who had been delivered normally and in whom there was no obvious disease in either infant or mother, which might have a bearing on the subject of this paper.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Recent {{studies have}} {{hypothesized}} that perinatal complications might {{increase the risk}} of developing eating disorders. However, it is unclear which pathways might link obstetric complications and eating disorders. The present study aimed at exploring the relationship between obstetric complications and temperament in eating disordered subjects. METHODS: The sample was selected among subjects who took part in a prevalence study carried out on a representative sample of the general population and from among people with anorexia and bulimia nervosa referred to an outpatient specialist unit. Subjects who were born in the two obstetric wards of Padua Hospital between 1971 and 1979 and who completed the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire were included. A blind analysis of the obstetric records of the whole sample was performed. The final sample was composed of 66 anorexia nervosa, 44 bulimia nervosa, and 257 control subjects. RESULTS: Among the different groups of obstetric complications, only the group that included preterm birth and other signs of neonatal immaturity or <b>dysmaturity</b> displayed a significant relationship with harm avoidance. The use of a mediation path analytic model revealed a significant, but incomplete, mediation effect of harm avoidance in explaining the link between neonatal <b>dysmaturity</b> and the development of eating disorders. Maternal weight gain during pregnancy seemed to have a protective effect on harm avoidance. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of signs of neonatal <b>dysmaturity</b> at birth seems to influence the development of high levels of harm avoidance in eating disorders...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Perinatal factors {{seem to be}} {{implicated in}} the {{pathogenesis}} of anorexia nervosa (AN) and {{may be involved in}} the programming of stress response systems in humans. Our aim was to explore one of the possible pathways to explain the association between perinatal complications and a psychiatric disorder. In particular, we tested the hypothesis that neonatal immaturity may confer an enhanced vulnerability to AN after exposure to a severe stressful event, such as childhood abuse. METHOD: The sample was composed of subjects who took part in a prevalence study carried out on a representative sample of the general population and cases of AN referred to an out-patient specialist unit. All subjects (n= 663) were born in the two obstetric wards of Padua Hospital between 1971 and 1979. We analysed data using both a case-control and a cohort design. RESULTS: We found that functional signs of neonatal <b>dysmaturity,</b> but not a low birthweight or prematurity, had a significant additive interaction with childhood abuse in determining the risk for this illness. In normal subjects, but not in subjects with AN, neonatal <b>dysmaturity</b> was associated with being small, short or thin for gestational age at birth. CONCLUSIONS: The synergistic effect of neonatal <b>dysmaturity</b> and childhood abuse in increasing the risk for AN provides evidence for the hypothesis that a prenatal programming of stress response systems can result in an impairment of the individual's resilience to severe stressful events...|$|E

40|$|A {{case-control study}} was {{conducted}} to identify risk factors for the congenital hypothyroidism and <b>dysmaturity</b> syndrome of foals. A questionnaire was used during personal interviews of foal owners and farm managers to collect information on animal signalment, farm environment, and mare management. Information on 39 foals with the congenital hypothyroidism and <b>dysmaturity</b> syndrome were compared with 39 control foals. Foals with the syndrome had a significantly (P < 0. 0001) longer gestation (357. 6 d) than control foals (338. 9 d). Pregnant mares that were fed greenfeed, did not receive any supplemental mineral, left their "home farm" during gestation, or grazed irrigated pasture had 13. 1 (P = 0. 0068), 5. 6 (P = 0. 0472), 4. 3 (P = 0. 0076), and approximately 15. 3 (P = 0. 0245), respectively, greater odds of producing an affected foal than mares not experiencing these events. Greenfeed often contains high levels of nitrate (NO 3 -), which is known to impair thyroid gland function. In light of this, forage samples from participating farms were analyzed for nitrate levels. The odds of one or more congenitally hypothyroid and dysmature foals being born on a farm feeding forage with at least a trace of nitrate was 8. 0 times greater (P = 0. 0873) than the odds of the disease occurring on a farm that fed forage free of nitrate. Further, the odds of a mare producing an affected foal when fed forage containing at least a trace of nitrate were 5. 9 times greater (P = 0. 0007) than those of a mare fed nitrate free forage. This study suggests that congenital hypothyroidism and <b>dysmaturity</b> syndrome in foals {{may be the result of}} diets that contain nitrate or that are low in iodine being fed to pregnant mares...|$|E
40|$|To provide {{data about}} the role of obstetric {{complications}} (OCs) in a large and well-characterized sample of patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) or bulimia nervosa (BN). METHOD: The new sample consists of 150 patients with AN and 35 patients with BN, and 73 healthy women; statistical analyses were performed on the new sample alone and on the larger sample created by merging the new dataset with the previous one (264 AN, 108 BN, and 624 healthy women). All data about OCs were collected blind to diagnostic status. RESULTS: OC rates in the replication sample were similar to those of our previous studies. In the whole sample, the risk of developing AN was significantly associated with the occurrence and number of pregnancy, delivery, hypoxic, and <b>dysmaturity</b> complications. The risk of developing BN was significantly associated with <b>dysmaturity</b> complications. Signs of retarded fetal growth (being small and short for gestational age, short head circumference) significantly distinguished BN patients from both AN and healthy individuals. Significantly higher number of OCs were found in the binge eating/purging type of AN, in comparison with restricting AN patients.

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Bedfordshire, in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of PhilosophyIn this thesis, we develop and test a technology for computer-assisted assessments of newborn brain maturity from sleep electroencephalogram (EEG). Brain maturation of newborns is reflected in rapid development of EEG patterns {{over a number of}} weeks after conception. Observing the maturational patterns, experts can assess newborn’s EEG maturity with an accuracy ± 2 weeks of newborn’s stated age. A mismatch between the EEG patterns and newborn’s physiological age alerts clinicians about possible neurological problems. Analysis of newborn EEG requires specialised skills to recognise the maturity-related waveforms and patterns and interpret them in the context of newborns age and behavioural state. It is highly desirable to make the results of maturity assessment most accurate and reliable. However, the expert analysis is limited in capability to estimate the uncertainty in assessments. To enable experts quantitatively evaluate risks of brain <b>dysmaturity</b> for each case, we employ the Bayesian model averaging methodology. This methodology, in theory, provides the most accurate assessments along with the estimates of uncertainty, enabling experts {{to take into account the}} full information about the risk of decision making. Such information is particularly important when assessing the EEG signals which are highly variable and corrupted by artefacts. The use of decision tree models within the Bayesian averaging enables interpreting the results as a set of rules and finding the EEG features which make the most important contribution to assessments. The developed technology was tested on approximately 1, 000 EEG recordings of newborns aged 36 to 45 weeks post conception, and the accuracy of assessments was comparable to that achieved by EEG experts. In addition, it was shown that the Bayesian assessment can be used to quantitatively evaluate the risk of brain <b>dysmaturity</b> for each EEG recording...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: A {{premature}} birth can cause parental stress, anxiety and uncertainty. This study illustrates the long-term {{consequences of a}} preterm birth for family life. DESIGN: Retrospective study by questionnaire. METHOD: Parents of 959 children, who were born in 1983 with a gestational age of less than 32 weeks or a birth weight of less than 1500 grams, were approached when their children turned 19 years old. We investigated various aspects of their family lives {{by means of a}} written questionnaire. RESULTS: We received completed questionnaires back from 595 parents (62 %). The divorce rate was higher in families with a disabled child (26 vs. 14 %). Working mothers (n = 257) and fathers (n = 506) experienced negative consequences in their workplace (36 % and 2 %, respectively). The risk factor was having a handicapped child. Financial problems were present in 11 % of the families during the first year and 4 % still experienced financial problems after 19 years; risk factors were a handicap, male gender and a low social-economic status (SES) of the parents. Of the respondents, 26 % had observed a decrease in social activities and friends during the first year and 15 % felt that family and friends provided insufficient support during this year. After 19 years, 4 % of the respondents still experienced a negative influence on their social lives. Risk factors were a handicap, normal birth weight (no <b>dysmaturity),</b> male gender and low SES. 28 % of parents expressed that during the first year having a preterm child was emotional challenging or difficult to accept. After 19 years, 3 % still expressed an unfavourable effect of the preterm birth. Risk factors were handicap, <b>dysmaturity</b> and male gender.

40|$|It is now {{established}} that the dysmature infant, of low birthweight {{for the period of}} gestation, may develop a diabetic state in the neonatal period (Arey, 1953; Engleson and Zetterqvist, 1957; Hutchison, Keay, and Kerr, 1962). This condition, which is temporary and has a good prognosis, has to be distinguished from other causes of hyperglycaemia. Permanent diabetes mellitus occurs rarely in the neonatal period (Guest, 1949; Gans, 1953; Hofman-Bang, 1954). Ketosis and acetonuria occur in these cases whereas this is not a feature in the temporary type. Infection and cerebral damage may also cause hyperglycaemia and in some of the reported cases of neonatal diabetes this may have been a factor (Strandqvist, 1932; Lewis and Eisenberg, 1935; Limper and Miller, 1935; Devine, 1938).

40|$|AbstractSince the {{establishment}} of in vitro fertilization, it became evident that {{almost half of the}} couples failed to achieve fertilization and this phenomenon was attributed to a male gamete dysfunction. The adoption of assisted fertilization techniques particularly ICSI has been able to alleviate male factor infertility by granting the consistent ability of a viable spermatozoon to activate an oocyte. Single sperm injection, by pinpointing the beginning of fertilization, has been an invaluable tool in clarifying the different aspects of early fertilization and syngamy. However, even with ICSI some couples fail to fertilize due to ooplasmic <b>dysmaturity</b> in relation to the achieved nuclear maturation marked by the extrusion of the first polar body. More uncommon are cases where the spermatozoa partially or completely lack the specific oocyte activating factor. In this work, we review the most relevant aspects of fertilization and its failure through assisted reproductive technologies.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Women in {{pregnancy}} and postpartum {{have an increased}} vulnerability to develop an affective disorder. Affective disorders {{in pregnancy}} are {{associated with an increased}} risk of prematurity, <b>dysmaturity</b> (foetal weight below the 10 th percentile as determined by ultrasound) and the development of postpartum depressive disorder. Untreated affective disorders and their complications may also result in considerable costs. Recent meta-analyses showed that interventions during pregnancy are less effective than postpartum interventions probably because of high attrition due to the barriers pregnant women experience with attending sessions outside their homes. An internet-based self-help intervention may overcome these barriers as it can be followed at home, and also in one's own time. Such internet interventions showed to be effective for decreasing affective symptoms in general. This randomised clinical trial examines whether an internet-based self-help intervention is effective in the reduction of affective symptoms in pregnancy and postpartum and results in an improvement of the perinatal outcome. We will also determine the cost-effectiveness of the intervention...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Hypoxic/ischemic {{encephalopathy}} in a cloned American Quarter horse foal {{was initially}} associated with placental insufficiency and exacerbated by protracted hypotension during anesthesia for a surgical procedure. The foal, {{born at the}} Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Center, was diagnosed at birth with neonatal maladjustment syndrome that was accompanied by <b>dysmaturity,</b> muscle contracture of the front limbs, and a blood clot within the lumen of the urinary bladder. Seizures that developed after anesthesia were attributed to hypoxia/ischemia during anesthesia and culminated in death. Macroscopically, the cerebrum had flattened cerebral gyri with shallow sulci, yellowish cortical discoloration, and apple-green autofluorescence (under 365 -nm ultraviolet light) at the cortical/white matter junction. Microscopically, there was laminar cortical necrosis with prominent diffuse ischemic change of neuronal cell bodies. The white matter had prominent rarefaction with focal axonal and myelin degeneration and focal macrophage (gitter cell) accumulation.

For those female patients with the anomaly who survive to adult life there is little information available about pregnancy, maternal complications, and fetal outcome. This study was designed to address this issue so that these patients can receive appropriate advice and management. METHODS AND RESULTS [...] Forty two pregnancies in 12 women with Ebstein's anomaly were studied. The mothers' cardiac lesions were assessed on the basis of symptoms, the presence of cyanosis or arrhythmia, and by echocardiographic grading of severity. In the absence of important maternal cyanosis or arrhythmia, pregnancy was well tolerated. Neonatal outcome was good though there was an increased risk of prematurity and <b>dysmaturity</b> in the babies born to mothers with cyanosis. CONCLUSIONS [...] This study indicates that women with Ebstein's anomaly who reach child-bearing age can be advised that pregnancy is likely to be well tolerated with good fetal outcome.

She showed symptoms of <b>dysmaturity,</b> generalized hypotonia, myoclonic seizures and progressive respiratory failure, leading to death on the seventh day of life. Structural abnormalities of {{the central nervous system}} consisted of severe cerebellar hypoplasia and optic nerve atrophy. Biochemical analysis of a muscle biopsy specimen demonstrated deficiency of cytochrome c oxidase activity. Cultured fibroblasts from this patient also showed a selective decrease in the activity of cytochrome c oxidase, excluding a muscle-specific type of deficiency. Further investigations in cultured fibroblasts revealed that synthesis, assembly and stability of both the mitochondrial and the nuclear subunits of the enzyme were entirely normal. The steady-state concentration of cytochrome c oxidase in the fibroblasts of the patient was also normal, suggesting that the kinetic properties of the enzyme were altered. Analysis of the kinetic parameters of cytochrome c oxidase demonstrated an aberrant interaction between cytochrome c oxidase and its substrate, cytochrome c, most likely because of a mutation in one of the nuclear subunits of the enzyme...|$|E

STUDY DESIGN: This study {{was part of the}} 19 -year follow-up in a large ongoing collaborative study in The Netherlands (the POPS study) on the long-term outcome of prematurity and <b>dysmaturity.</b> 656 adolescents from the POPS study without serious handicap were compared with peers in the general population in lifestyle, risk-taking behavior, psychopathology, and social participation. RESULTS: Adolescents from the POPS study smoked significantly less than their peers.

Study Design: We performed a morphometric study of 38 term villi in 5 diabetic placentae and of 37 term villi of 5 normal placentae in order to know the different extension of endothelial surface (VL), the maximum (D max) and minimum (D min) distance of the vessels from the basal membrane, {{as well as the}} exact thickness of basal membrane (MT BM). The villi were examined with transmission electron microscopy, and parameters were automatically acquired with the iTEM software (Soft Imaging System, Münster, Germany). Results: VL results were statistically higher in diabetic placentae than in normal ones. Also D max and D min were higher in diabetic disease. MT BM was not different in the two groups. Conclusion: Our findings show that, in the presence of chorangiosis, the vessel surface in diabetic placentae is higher than in normal group, but the vessels are randomly distributed in term villi. The basal membrane is not different in the two groups. Morphometric evaluation seems to be more accurate using ultrafine samples...|$|E
40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{pathophysiology}} of nocturnal enuresis {{and to establish}} its rational classification and treatment, clinical and electroencephalographic studies were made on 404 enuretic children, including an overnight polysomnographic investigation on 55 cases. EEG was normal in only 76 cases(18. 8 %). Background EEG abnormalities were observed in 226 cases(55. 9 %). This suggested the presence of brain immaturity or <b>dysmaturity</b> in enuretic children. Epileptic discharges were detected in 94 cases(23. 3 %), but not concomitant with the enuretic events. The epileptic mechanism may not play a primary role in the manifestation of enuresis. Specific EEG patterns of subcortical origin, i. e., 6 c/s wave-and-spike phantom, 14 & 6 c/s positive epikes, anterior theta burst, and mu rhythm, were detected {{in as many as}} 188 cases(46. 5 %). This indicates the importance of subcortical brain dysfunction in enuresis. During overnight polysomnographic recordings, 38 enuretic episodes were observed in 30 cases. Twenty eight episodes appeared in light sleep, 8 episodes in deep sleep, but only 2 episodes in REM sleep. According to the arousal response at the time of enuresis, enuretics were properly classified into arousal type(12 cases) and non-arousal type(18 cases).

The surface markers of mature DCs and cytokines levels were different in each group; the positive rate of CD 80, CD 1 a, HLA-DR, and CD 1 a was the lowest in SDKD group. After 3 -month intervention, the expression of CD 80, CD 86, CD 1 a, HLA-DR, and IL- 12 significantly increased, while ALT, AST, and IL- 10 significantly decreased (P< 0. 05) in treatment groups. HBV-DNA level also significantly reduced in both SDKD and SDLD groups (P< 0. 05). Conclusions. HBeAg negative patients had DCs <b>dysmaturity,</b> and there were differences between different SD syndromes. Chinese medicine intervention according to syndrome differentiation could advance the maturity and function of DCs and improve the therapeutic effect...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{and compare the}} incidence of histopathological placental lesions in mild gestational hyperglycemia, gestational diabetes and overt diabetes at term and preterm gestation. Research design and methods: One-hundred-and-thirty-one placental samples were collected from Diabetes mellitus (DM) positive screened patients. Two diagnostic tests, glycemic profile and 100 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in parallel identified 4 groups normoglycemic, mild gestational hyperglycemia (MGH), gestational DM (GDM) or overt DM (DM). Placental tissue specimens and sections from 4 groups were obtained by uniform random sampling and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Results: Placentas from MGH group presented 17 types of histopathological change and higher rates of syncytial nodes and endarteritis. GDM placentas presented only nine types of histopathological change, high rates of <b>dysmaturity,</b> low rates of calcification and no syncytial nodes. Overt DM placentas showed 22 types of histopathological change, 21 of which {{were present in the}} preterm period. There were histopathological similarities between MGH and DM placentas, but the former exhibited a higher incidence of endarteritis, which {{has been described as a}} “post-mortem ” phenomenon. Conclusion: Our results confirmed that the distinct placental changes associated with DM and MGH depend on gestational period during which the diabetic insult occurs. It may reasonably be inferred that subclinical maternal hyperglycemia during pregnancy, as showed in MGH group, is responsible for increased placental endarteritis, a postmortem lesion in the live fetus...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Pregnancy-induced hypertension, {{pre-eclampsia}} and eclampsia {{are parts}} of the hypertensive syndrome which is a life-threatening condition both for mother and fetus. Apart from being associated with unpredictable onset, it is incurable, except by ending the pregnancy. Its incidence is approximately between 6 - 10 % of pregnant women. There is no unique definition and classification of the hypertensive syndrome in pregnancy, i. e. they differ from one expert group to another. Risks of pregnancy-induced hypertension. Pregnancy-induced hypertension syndrome can cause placental abruption, intracranial hemorrhage, liver lesions, acute renal disorders and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypervolemia and inhalation of gastric content, due to deep sedation. Treatment of pregnancy-induced hypertension. Delivery is always appropriate therapy for the mother, but {{may not be a}} good solution for the fetus. Standard treatment of pre-eclampsia includes: anticonvulsive therapy, antihypertensive therapy, excessive fluid administration, and if necessary, management of oliguria, DIC, pulmonary edema and recovery of liver function. The outcome of pregnancy-induced hypertension (perinatal and maternal mortality). Maternal mortality due to pregnancy-induced hypertension is 15 - 33 % out {{of the total number of}} maternal deaths. Newborn infants of mothers with pregnancy-induced hypertension present with intrauterine growth retardation, prematurity, <b>dysmaturity</b> and necrotizing enterocolitis. Pregnancy-induced hypertension is one of the major causes of maternal and fetal/neonatal morbidity and mortality. ...|$|E
40|$|AIMS [...] To {{evaluate}} {{the ability of}} five experienced perinatal pathologists to assess placental maturity reliably by histology. METHODS [...] Twenty four haematoxylin and eosin slides, six each from placentas of 27, 31, 35, and 39 weeks' gestation, were circulated to five pathologists on three separate occasions. The slides were labelled with the correct or incorrect gestational ages. RESULTS [...] The mean absolute error over all 360 readings was 2. 72 weeks. Only 54 % of the slides were assessed within {{two weeks of the}} correct gestation. Pathologist tended to overestimate younger gestations and underestimate older gestations. Two, and possibly three, pathologist were influenced by the gestational age state on the label. One pathologist, who {{did not appear to be}} influenced by the label, was more accurate in diagnosing gestation of the placentas than other colleagues. CONCLUSIONS [...] Experienced pathologists can have difficulty in assessing the villous maturity of placentas by histology. They can also be influenced by clinical information provided, such as gestational age. Other observer reliability studies must address the issue of the influence of labelled information on observer variation. A difference in maturation would have to be of a six week magnitude to have a chance of being detected by current methods. This may limit the value of the histological diagnosis of placental <b>dysmaturity</b> as a surrogate marker for uteroplacental ischaemia...|$|E

40|$|Premature {{birth is}} highly {{prevalent}} and associated with neurodevelopmental delays and disorders. Adverse outcomes, particularly in children born before 32 weeks of gestation, {{have been attributed}} {{in large part to}} white matter injuries, often found in periventricular regions using conventional imaging. To date, tractography studies of white matter pathways in children and adolescents born preterm have evaluated {{only a limited number of}} tracts simultaneously. The current study compares diffusion properties along 18 major cerebral white matter pathways in children and adolescents born preterm (n = 27) and full term (n = 19), using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and tractography. We found that compared to the full term group, the preterm group had significantly decreased FA in segments of the bilateral uncinate fasciculus and anterior segments of the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. Additionally, the preterm group had significantly increased FA in segments of the right and left anterior thalamic radiations, posterior segments of the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and the right and left inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Increased FA in the preterm group was generally associated with decreased radial diffusivity. These findings indicate that prematurity-related white matter differences in later childhood and adolescence do not affect all tracts in the periventricular zone and can involve both decreased and increased FA. Differences in the patterns of radial diffusivity and axial diffusivity suggest that the tissue properties underlying group FA differences may vary within and across white matter tracts. Distinctive diffusion properties may relate to variations in the timing of injury in the neonatal period, extent of white matter <b>dysmaturity</b> and/or compensatory processes in childhood...|$|E
