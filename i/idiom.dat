From this the <b>idiom</b> of a silver bullet developed into figuratively referring to any simple solution with very high effectiveness or almost miraculous results, as in the widely discussed software engineering paper No Silver Bullet.

40|$|Given {{that the}} meaning of <b>idioms</b> is not {{predictable}} from the literal meaning of their parts, we can broadly define <b>idioms</b> as expressions with a non-compositional interpretation. Since language is a compositional system, this characteristic of <b>idioms</b> might suggest that they are atomic building blocks of language with no internal syntax. However, that turns {{out not to be}} the case. This paper explores the syntax of English verbal <b>idioms</b> and their degree of compositionality. <b>Idioms</b> do have an internal syntactic structure that is actually variable to an extent and, despite being superficially similar, different <b>idioms</b> exhibit different syntactic properties. The topics discussed include the variability of determiners in <b>idioms,</b> the subcategorisation of <b>idioms</b> based on their relative compositionality into two groups that behave differently with respect to their syntactic flexibility, and the identification of grammatical categories that are obligatory components of certain <b>idioms</b> but not others...|$|R
40|$|<b>Idioms</b> {{are found}} in every {{language}} and learning them is {{an important aspect of}} the mastery of a language. The English language is no exception as it contains a large number of <b>idioms,</b> which are extensively used. However, because of their rather rigid structure and quite unpredictable meaning, <b>idioms</b> are often considered difficult to learn. Although little research has been done to date on the nature of <b>idioms</b> as well as how they are used, a better understanding of variations in <b>idioms</b> can nevertheless be acquired by looking at some theories and thoughts about their use and their structure. The aim {{of this paper is to}} examine a number of animal <b>idioms,</b> focusing primarily on English <b>idioms</b> and the similarities and differences found in equivalent Swedish <b>idioms,</b> even when the Swedish <b>idioms</b> do not contain an animal. Two types of studies are presented. In the first one, the English and Swedish animal <b>idioms</b> collected are grouped into four categories. The results of such a categorization show that half of the English animal <b>idioms</b> found have an equivalent in Swedish containing an animal. In the second study, the content, structure, wording, semantics and metaphorical meaning of the animal <b>idioms</b> are analysed and compared. The results indicate that the Swedish animal <b>idioms</b> that correspond to the English animal <b>idioms</b> have, for the most part, the same structures and similar variations in degree of literalness, fixity, manipulation and transformation. Furthermore, the use of metaphor, personification and simile appears to be common both in English and Swedish animal <b>idioms.</b> The role of context and literal and figurative translation are also addressed in this study...|$|R

5|$|The vimana {{of their}} temples (tower over the shrine) is a {{compromise}} in detail between the plain stepped {{style of the}} early Chalukyas and the decorative finish of the Hoysalas.

They popularised the use of decorative Kirtimukha (demon faces) in their sculptures. Famous architects in the Hoysala kingdom included Chalukyan architects who were natives of places such as Balligavi. The artistic wall decor and the general sculptural <b>idiom</b> was dravidian architecture. This style is sometimes called Karnata dravida, one of the notable traditions in Indian architecture.|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} of how <b>idioms</b> should be lemmatised is a fundamental issue in the lexicographic treatment of <b>idioms</b> and {{has been the focus}} of much debate ever since the first International Symposium on Lexicography. Several proposals for a systematic lexico-graphic treatment of <b>idioms</b> have been put forward (e. g. Cowie 1981, Burger 1983, Braasch 1988, Schemann 1991, Burger 1998 etc.). In this paper, we examine how semi- and non-literal <b>idioms</b> are lemmatised in some of the most widely-known dictionaries of German, English and Dutch. In what follows, we confine ourselves to the treatment of <b>idioms</b> in mono- and bilingual general dictionaries which are alphabetically ordered.

40|$|Language has an {{important}} role to create a literary works. Literary works expresses a series of happening of human life, such as their social problems, struggles of life and conflicts. There are several forms of literary works such as short story, novel, drama and poetry. Poetry as one of literary works has beautiful and graceful characteristics. The form of song resembles to the poetry, but it still has a distance to go. The word of song could be more pleasing when the letter is set to the music. In addition, by understanding the lyrics of the songs, people may enjoy the music. This study was aimed to find out the types of <b>idioms</b> and the meaning of <b>idioms</b> found in “Dream Theatre” album entitled “Images and Words”. This study used descriptive research design. Besides, the objective approach was also used to describe the literary product as a self-sufficient object: which was analyzed and judged without necessarily studying the author’s life. In this thesis, the object of the study was three songs of “Images and Words” album.

5|$|As the 18th century dawned, Sicilian architects were {{employed}} to create the new palazzi and churches. These architects, often local, were able to design in a more sophisticated style {{than those of the}} late 17th century; many had been trained in mainland Italy and had returned with a more detailed understanding of the Baroque <b>idiom.</b> Their work inspired less-travelled Sicilian designers. Very importantly, these architects were also assisted by the books of engravings by Domenico de' Rossi, who for the first time wrote down text with his engravings, giving the precise dimensions and measurements of many of the principal Renaissance and Baroque façades in Rome. In this way, the Renaissance finally came late to Sicily by proxy.|$|E

Many of his Russian contemporaries, and his pupils at the Leningrad Conservatory were strongly influenced by his style (including German Okunev, Boris Tishchenko, whose 5th Symphony of 1978 is dedicated to Shostakovich's memory, Sergei Slonimsky, and others). Shostakovich's conservative <b>idiom</b> has grown increasingly popular with audiences both within and beyond Russia, as the avant-garde has declined in influence and debate about his political views has developed.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the lexical representation of <b>idioms.</b> We distinguish <b>idioms</b> from other kinds of multiple-word expressions like collocations, support-verb constructions, and lexicalized metaphors. A lexical representation for <b>idioms</b> in Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) is proposed, which can account for the syntactic variability found in idiomatic constructions, and for the non-compositional semantics of <b>idioms.</b> Since all <b>idioms,</b> which are not completely fixed, consist of a lexical head and "frozen" complements, the information about an idiomatic expression can be encoded in the subcategorization list of the <b>idiom's</b> lexical head. Since <b>idioms</b> involve selection for particular lexemes, a feature is added to HPSG signs to encode this lexemic information. It will be argued that the Locality Principle of HPSG is too strong because it prohibits the representation of <b>idioms</b> proposed in this paper, and that the Semantics Principle must be modified. We explain the fact that some <b>idioms</b> do not passivize by the fact that no thematic role is assigned to accusative objects like the bucket in kick the bucket...|$|R

5|$|According to Daniel Joseph Singal, Faulkner's {{literary}} style gradually {{developed from}} 19th century Victorian to modernist, with Light in August more firmly {{grounded in the}} tradition of the latter. The novel is characteristic of the modernist fascination with polaritieslight and dark, good and evilthe burden of history on the present, and the splintering of personal identity. The plot is also divided into dual currents, one focusing on Lena Grove and the other on Joe Christmas, a technique that Faulkner continued to use in other works. The narrative is not structured in any particular order, as it is often interrupted by lengthy flashbacks and constantly shifts from one character to another. This lack of organization and narrative continuity was viewed negatively by some critics. As in his other novels, Faulkner employs elements of oral storytelling, allowing different characters to lend voice to the narrative in their own distinct Southern <b>idiom.</b> Unlike some of the other Yoknapatawpha County novels, notably The Sound and the Fury, Light in August does not rely solely on stream-of-consciousness narration, but also incorporates dialogue and an omniscient third-person narrator that develop the story.|$|E
5|$|German {{classical}} music includes works {{by some of}} the world's most well-known composers. Dieterich Buxtehude composed oratorios for organ, which influenced the later work of Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Friedrich Händel; these men were influential composers of the Baroque period. During his tenure as violinist and teacher at the Salzburg cathedral, Augsburg-born composer Leopold Mozart mentored one of the most noted musicians of all time: Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Ludwig van Beethoven was a crucial figure in the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras. Carl Maria von Weber and Felix Mendelssohn were important in the early Romantic period. Robert Schumann and Johannes Brahms composed in the Romantic <b>idiom.</b> Richard Wagner was known for his operas. Richard Strauss was a leading composer of the late Romantic and early modern eras. Karlheinz Stockhausen and Hans Zimmer are important composers of the 20th and early 21st centuries.|$|E
5|$|Josquin likely {{learned his}} craft {{in his home}} region in the North, in France, and then in Italy {{when he went to}} Milan and Rome.

By the end of his long creative career, which spanned approximately 50 productive years, he had developed a simplified style in which each voice of a polyphonic composition exhibited free and smooth motion, and close attention was paid to clear setting of text as well as clear alignment of text with musical motifs. While other composers were influential on the development of Josquin's style, especially in the late 15th century, he himself became the most influential composer in Europe, especially after the development of music printing, which was concurrent with the years of his maturity and peak output. This event made his influence even more decisive than it might otherwise have been.|$|E
