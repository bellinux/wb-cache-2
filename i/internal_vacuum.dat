The angular dependence of isobaric ratios, like He- 6 /Li- 6 at low emission velocities and temperatures extracted from isotopic (double) ratios, do exhibit differences, even from this model.

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} one of nontrivial octonion related facts. According {{to paper}} gr-qc/ 0409095, {{the most stable}} space-time state is the one described by real Dirac matrices in 11 -dimensional space of signature 1 (-) & 10 (+). The internal subspace is 7 -dimensional, and its stability {{is due to a}} high ``zero'' energy packing density when using an oblique-angled basis from fundamental vectors of lattice E_ 8 for the spinor degrees of freedom. The nontrivial fact consists in the following: Dirac symbols with octonion matrix elements can be used to describe states of the space of internal degrees of freedom if and only if the space corresponds either to stable vacuum states or states close to the just mentioned ones. The coincidence of the internal space dimension and signature for absolutely different and independent approaches to the consideration of this issue seems to predetermine the <b>internal</b> space <b>vacuum</b> properties and the apparatus, which is able to constitute the basis of the unified interaction theory.

To simulate these reactions, three conditions of mechanical damage were introduced to metal cans of peaches in syrup in a controlled manner, to determine the evolution of the degree of internal oxidation of these cans as compared to undamaged cans, and to evaluate the possibility of exploiting the contents for consumption by the needy. The cans were classified according to the degree of damage and evaluated by a storage test for a period of 365 days under controlled temperature conditions, 35 °C ± 2 °C, with periodic evaluations of the visual internal appearance of the cans, the chromium, tin and iron concentrations in the product and the <b>internal</b> <b>vacuum</b> level of the can.

40|$|Ring {{instability}} is an impulsive deformation that progresses. At worst, instability is ring collapse. Buried pipes can invert only if {{the ring}} deflects and the soil slips at the same time. Instability of buried pipes is analyzed as a soil-structure interaction. Ring stiffness resists inversion; soil supports the ring to keep it close to circular shape. The present paper demonstrates the basic manners of ring instability for buried flexible pipes, ring deformation and buckling at yield stress. The analysis found that if the pipe is {{to be subjected to}} vacuum {{it is very important to}} limit ring deflection to 5 %. Because it increases the maximum vacuum to be larger than atmospheric pressure, therefore the pipe would not collapse. If the pipe is so flexible ring stiffness cannot be support any of the soil load. With 8 % ring deflection, the vacuum at collapse is,- 0. 55 bar with neglect term, Ed/rn 3, for ring stiffness. For the design of pipes to withstand <b>internal</b> <b>vacuum,</b> a safety factor of 1. 5 is recommended. It is prudent to require that embedment soil be denser than critical. Critical density can be evaluated in the soils laboratory.

5000|$|Formally called [...] "encapsulation", potting {{consists}} of immersing the part or assembly in a liquid resin, then curing it. Potting {{can be done}} in a pre-molded potting shell, or directly in a mold. Today it is most widely used to protect semiconductor components from moisture and mechanical damage, and to serve as a mechanical structure holding the lead frame and the chip together. In earlier times it was often used to discourage reverse engineering of proprietary products built as printed circuit modules. It is also commonly used in high voltage products to allow live parts to be placed closer together, so that the product can be smaller. This also excludes dirt and conductive contaminants (such as impure water) from sensitive areas. Another use is to protect deep-submergence items such as sonar transducers from collapsing under extreme pressure, by filling all voids. Potting can be rigid or soft. When void-free potting is required, it is common practice to place the product in a vacuum chamber while the resin is still liquid, hold a vacuum for several minutes to draw the air out of internal cavities and the resin itself, then release the vacuum. Atmospheric pressure collapses the voids and forces the liquid resin into all <b>internal</b> spaces. <b>Vacuum</b> potting works best with resins that cure by polymerization, rather than solvent evaporation.|$|R

40|$|The Einstein-Hilbert worldspace {{action is}} used to {{investigate}} the dynamics of extended object. In the Robertson-Walker worldspace, this is seen to introduce a pressureless density which could contribute to dark matter. Such pressureless energy density, present from the very beginning, should have enormous consequences on large scale structure formation in the early Universe. Generalizing the idea to complexified internal co-ordinates, it becomes possible to gauge the action with U(1) symmetry.

Generally, the equations of motion of the gauge fields are Maxwell equations with source terms that include these fields themselves.
