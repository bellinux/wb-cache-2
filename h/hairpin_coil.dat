These types of application normally utilise a <b>hairpin</b> <b>coil</b> or a transverse flux coil which sits {{over the edge of the}} component.

40|$|These {{internal}} coils {{are used}} to condense and cool the gaseous argon contained in the LAr storage dewar at D 0, at a rate not to exceed 40 KW. The coolant is LN{sub 2 }, piped in from another, similar, dewar of 36 -feet higher elevation (see Diagram A). The specific design of the coils are outlined in Process Engineering drawing C- 32545, attached. The material components are as follows. The internal coil piping material is constructed of 165 -feet of 1 1 / 2 -inch NPS schedule 40 pipe, of type 5083 aluminum. 3 -inch NPS schedule 80 type 5086 aluminum pipe {{is used for the}} headers of the triple <b>hairpin</b> <b>coil</b> welded assembly. The coils are supported by a series of aluminum brackets fixed to the roof of the dewar. Note 35 on the drawing points out the brackets which hold the coils to the roof of the dewar. They are not connected in any way to the coils, and act only as supports. This feature allows for contraction of the coils, and avoids any longitudinal thermal contraction stresses at the vessel nozzles that might have occurred. A stress analysis of the internal coil feed lines is outlined in DO engineering note 239. The analysis shows that the stresses experienced by the nodes where the coil feed lines pierce the inner vessel are on the order of one fifth of the stresses allowable for this design. The coils have been pressure tested at Process Engineering at 200 psi, which is above the accepted percentage for pressure tests of vessels of 125 % of maximum allowable working pressure. The maximum pressure which could theoretically develop in the condenser coil is 150 psi. Anything above this pressure will vent through PSV 614 N, set at 150 psi. In addition, the coils have been satisfactorily leak checked at PEI and at Fermilab...|$|E
40|$|Characterizing the {{conformational}} {{properties and}} dynamics of biopolymers and {{their relation to}} biological activity and function is an ongoing challenge. Single molecule techniques have provided a rich experimental window on these properties, yet they have often relied on simple one-dimensional projections of a multidimensional free energy landscape for a practical interpretation of the results. Here, we study three short peptides with different structural propensity (α helical, β <b>hairpin,</b> and random <b>coil)</b> in the presence (or absence) of a force applied to their ends using Langevin dynamics simulation and an all-atom model with implicit solvation. Each peptide produces fluctuation power spectra with a characteristic dynamic fingerprint consistent with persistent structural motifs of helices, <b>hairpins,</b> and random <b>coils.</b> The spectra for helix formation shows two well-defined relaxation modes, corresponding to local relaxation and cooperative coil to uncoil interconversion. In contrast, both the <b>hairpin</b> and random <b>coil</b> are polymerlike, showing a broad and continuous range of relaxation modes giving characteristic power laws of ω− 5 / 4 and ω− 3 / 2, respectively; the − 5 / 4 power law for hairpins is robust {{and has not been}} previously observed. Langevin dynamics simulations of diffusers on a potential of mean force derived from the atomistic simulations fail to reproduce the fingerprints of each peptide motif in the power spectral density, demonstrating explicitly that such information is lacking in such one-dimensional projections. Our results demonstrate the yet unexploited potential of single molecule fluctuation spectroscopy to probe more fine scaled properties of proteins and biological macromolecules and how low dimensional projections may cause the loss of relevant information...|$|R
40|$|Dynamics of {{a single}} {{stranded}} DNA, which can form a hairpin have been studied in the constant force ensemble. Using Langevin dynamics simulations, we obtained the force-temperature diagram, which differs from the theoretical prediction based on the lattice model. Probability analysis of the extreme bases of the stem revealed that at high temperature, the <b>hairpin</b> to <b>coil</b> transition is entropy dominated and the loop contributes significantly in its opening. However, at low temperature, the transition is force driven and the hairpin opens from the stem side. It is shown that the elastic energy {{plays a crucial role}} at high force. As a result, the phase diagram differs significantly with the theoretical prediction. Comment: 9 pages, 8 figures; J. Chem. Phys (2011...|$|R
50|$|CCDC42B protein form a {{secondary}} structure based upon alpha-helices. The structure of CCDC42B {{is predicted to}} contain several alpha-helices, and other random <b>coils.</b> <b>Hairpin</b> loop structures were detected at the 5'UTR and 3'UTR region of CCDC42B. Also, leucine zipper domain was found overlapping with coiled-coil domain. The attached image shows comparison between human CCDC42B and 5 other orthologs species which supports that human CCDC42B is primarily composed of alpha helices for its secondary structure.|$|R
40|$|Molecular beacons (MBs) are stem-loop DNA probes {{used for}} {{identifying}} and reporting {{the presence and}} localization of nucleic acid targets in vitro and in vivo via target-dependent dequenching of fluorescence. A drawback of conventional MB design {{is present in the}} stem sequence that is necessary to keep the MBs in a closed conformation {{in the absence of a}} target, but that can participate in target binding in the open (target-on) conformation, giving rise to the possibility of false-positive results. In order to circumvent these problems, we designed MBs in which the stem was replaced by an orthogonal DNA analog that does not cross-pair with natural nucleic acids. Homo-DNA seemed to be specially suited, as it forms stable adenine-adenine base pairs of the reversed Hoogsteen type, potentially reducing the number of necessary building blocks for stem design to one. We found that MBs in which the stem part was replaced by homo-adenylate residues can easily be synthesized using conventional automated DNA synthesis. As conventional MBs, such hybrid MBs show cooperative <b>hairpin</b> to <b>coil</b> transitions in the absence of a DNA target, indicating stable homo-DNA base pair formation in the closed conformation. Furthermore, our results show that the homo-adenylate stem is excluded from DNA target binding, which leads to a significant increase in target binding selectivit...|$|R
40|$|The peptide TGAAKAVALVL from glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate {{dehydrogenase}} {{adopts a}} helical conformation in the crystal structure {{and is a}} site for two hydrated helical segments, which {{are thought to be}} helical folding intermediates. Overlapping sequences of four to five residues from the peptide, sample both helical and strand conformations in known protein structures, which are dissimilar to glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase suggesting that the peptide may have a structural ambivalence. Molecular dynamics simulations of the peptide sequence performed for a total simulation time of 1. 2 Ps. starting from the various initial conformations using GROMOS 96 force field under NVT conditions, show that the peptide samples a large number of conformational forms with transitions from alpha-helix to beta-hairpin and vice versa. The peptide, therefore, displays a structural ambivalence. The mechanism from alpha-helix to beta-hair-pin transition and vice versa reveals that the compact bends and turns conformational forms mediate such conformational transitions. These compact structures including helices and hairpins have similar hydrophobic radius of gyration (R-gh) values suggesting that similar hydrophobic interactions govem these conformational forms. The distribution of conformational energies is Gaussian with helix sampling lowest energy followed by the <b>hairpins</b> and <b>coil.</b> The lowest potential energy of the full helix may enable the peptide to take up helical conformation in the crystal structure of the glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase, even though the peptide has a preference for hairpin too. The relevance of folding and unfolding events observed in our simulations to hydrophobic collapse model of protein folding are discussed. Copyright (C) 2007 European Peptide Society and, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Background: Eccrine poroma (EP) {{belongs to}} the group of benign adnexal tumors, but cases of eccrine porocarcinoma (EPC) arising on long-standing and {{untreated}} EP suggest a certain risk of malignant transformation. Objectives: To describe the clinical, dermoscopic and histopathologic features associated with different extremes in the spectrum of eccrine poroid neoplasms and to review the according literature. Methods: A retrospective analysis of patient characteristics and morphologic features associated with EP, EPC in situ and invasive porocarcinoma patients who attended two skin lesion clinics in Italy and Turkey between 2010 and 2011. Results: A total of 4 cases including 1 EP, 1 EPC in situ and 2 cases of invasive EPC in 4 patients were analyzed. Recent changes including bleeding, ulceration and sudden enlargement of a pre-existing lesion were associated with malignant transformation. Dermoscopically, polymorphous vessels consisting of <b>coiled,</b> <b>hairpin</b> and linear vessels were seen at all stages of progression. Histopathological findings of EPC in situ were limited to the epidermal component and were evident only at higher magnification. Conclusions: Clinicians and pathologists should carefully evaluate EPs with a recent history of change and erosion in order to avoid overlooking the potential development of EPC. © 2013 S.

40|$|It is {{now known}} that certain nucleic acid {{sequences}} assume secondary structures, such as hairpin loops, which are unusually stable. DNA molecules which contain such structural elements often exhibit aberrant mobility patterns during electrophoretic separation. The stability of secondary structural elements in nucleic acid molecules and their implications for both in-vitro and in-vivo applications are thus becoming a subject of growing interest. Presently, a small but increasing number of ultra stable DNA hairpin molecules have been studied. It is unlikely, however, that all such sequences have been identified, that the factors contributing to their stability are well understood, and that their implications for biological and laboratory processes have been fully elucidated. After demonstrating the dependence of the electrophoretic mobility of short deoxyribonucleotide hairpins on {{the stability of the}} structures which they assume, {{the relationship between the two}} has been exploited to allow selection and study of unusually stable hairpin molecules from DNA oligonculeotide libraries, utilizing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). The correlation between electrophoretic mobility and thermodynamic stability, was established by demonstrating that: (1) there was a significant and reproducible mobility difference between comparable molecules in the <b>hairpin</b> and random <b>coil</b> conformations, (2) that hairpins containing differing loop sequences have different mobility enhancements, (3) that these mobility enhancements were reduced by treatments known to disrupt secondary structure, and (4) that molecules with the highest Tm and α values also manifest the greatest relative mobility enhancements. A system for selecting and sequencing ultra stable hairpins was then developed. The efficacy of this selection system was demonstrated by its ability to isolate sequences known to form ultra stable structures GACGGAGTC, GACGAAGTC, GACGTAGTC, and GACGCAGTC from the GACNNNGTC oligonucleotide library. The sequences of the selected molecules were verified via matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectroscopy. The contribution of each base in the loop region to the overall stability of the GACGCAGTC tri-loop hairpin and the unusually stable CG AGTTTGACG heptaloop was probed via analysis of the PAGE separation pattern of N-substituted mini-libraries and by the subsequent MALDI-TOF sequencing of the band in each separation lane. ...|$|R
