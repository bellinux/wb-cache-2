25|$|One of {{his ideas}} that is {{considered}} most crucial for the understanding of his theology is <b>his</b> <b>notion</b> of correspondences. But, in fact, he first presented the theory of correspondences only in 1744, in {{the first volume of}} Regnum Animale dealing with the human soul.|$|E
25|$|The characteristica universalis is a {{recurring}} concept {{in the writings}} of Leibniz. When writing in French, he sometimes employed the phrase spécieuse générale to the same effect. The concept is sometimes paired with <b>his</b> <b>notion</b> of a calculus ratiocinator and with his plans for an encyclopaedia as a compendium of all human knowledge.|$|E
25|$|Cauchy (1789–1857) {{started the}} project of formulating and proving the theorems of infinitesimal {{calculus}} in a rigorous manner, rejecting the heuristic principle of the generality of algebra exploited by earlier authors. In his 1821 work Cours d'Analyse he defines infinitely small quantities in terms of decreasing sequences that converge to 0, which he then used to define continuity. But he did not formalize <b>his</b> <b>notion</b> of convergence.|$|E

25|$|Grothendieck's {{emphasis}} {{on the role of}} universal properties across varied mathematical structures brought category theory into the mainstream as an organizing principle for mathematics in general. Among its uses, category theory creates a common language for describing similar structures and techniques seen in many different mathematical systems. <b>His</b> <b>notion</b> of abelian category is now the basic object of study in homological algebra. The emergence of a separate mathematical discipline of category theory has been attributed to Grothendieck's influence, though unintentional.|$|E
25|$|Ehrenfest {{was also}} {{interested}} in developing mathematical theories in economics. This interest was stimulated by <b>his</b> <b>notion</b> {{that there should be}} an analogy between thermodynamics and economic processes. While this did not result in publications, he did encourage his graduate student Jan Tinbergen to follow up on this. Tinbergen's thesis was devoted to problems both from physics and economics, and he went on to become an economist and was awarded the first Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel in 1969.|$|E
25|$|When Dada reached Paris, it was avidly {{embraced by}} a group of young artists and writers who were fascinated with the {{writings}} of Sigmund Freud, particularly by <b>his</b> <b>notion</b> of the unconscious mind. The provocative spirit of Dada became linked to the exploration of the unconscious mind through the use of automatic writing, chance operations, and, in some cases, altered states. The surrealists quickly turned to painting and sculpture. The shock of unexpected elements, the use of Frottage, collage, and decalcomania, the rendering of mysterious landscapes and dreamed images were to become the key techniques {{through the rest of the}} 1930s.|$|E

25|$|Leavis is {{sometimes}} {{seen as having}} contributed to the mythos of Merrie England with <b>his</b> <b>notion</b> of the organic community, by which {{he seems to have}} meant a community with a deeply rooted and locally self-sufficient culture that he claimed to have existed in the villages of 17th and 18th century England and which was destroyed by the machine and mass culture introduced by the industrial revolution. Historians of the era have suggested that the idea was based on a misreading of history and that such communities had never existed. No historians of Early Modern Britain have supported the notion of the organic community.|$|E
25|$|The then current {{theory of}} colour held that white light was elementary, and that colours arose from {{mixtures}} {{of light and}} dark. Newton criticised this theory by noting that in that case a printed page, with its juxtaposition of light and dark, would look coloured. In folio 122 he recorded {{for the first time}} <b>his</b> <b>notion</b> that white light is heterogeneous and colour arise, not through the modification of a homogeneous white light, but from the separation of this mixture into its components. Newton also mentions Hooke's theory of colour, including his idea that it is a wave. Newton dismisses this theory with the remark that then light should bend around edges of objects as sounds does.|$|E
25|$|The other {{important}} figure is Uehara Naohiko, a radio personality and songwriter of the Ryukyu Broadcasting Corporation. Around 1970, he visited Amami Ōshima and was taught the name shima-uta by local singers. He {{stuck to the}} mixed writing (島うた). He claimed that the name {{had been used in}} Okinawa too, but Takahashi found no evidence to support his claim. <b>His</b> <b>notion</b> of shima-uta was drastically different from that of academics: he applied the term not only to traditional folk songs but to shin min'yō (contemporary folk music) and even to pop music. He used his radio programs and musical events to popularize the name shima-uta in Okinawa. Uehara was different from Nakasone in that he engaged in transforming folk songs into popular music.|$|E

25|$|That didn't mean Owen Sound was {{necessarily}} {{out of the}} picture, though. Bramalea and the Hamilton Red Wings of the Niagara District faced off for the Ontario {{championship and}} the Blues won the first game, but the contest was marred by a donnybrook that involved players, officials and fans and resulted in 14 police officers being called to the arena. The Blues immediately forfeited the series and incoming OHA president Cliffe Phillips decided to allow the Greys to return to action and take Bramalea's place in the final against Hamilton. Phillips soon found that <b>his</b> <b>notion</b> was not a popular one and he dropped it at once; the Greys missed out {{on a trip to}} the OHA final after a 13-year absence and the Sutherland Cup was awarded to the Red Wings as Ontario champs.|$|E
25|$|Stokowski {{also became}} known for modifying the orchestrations {{of some of}} the works that he conducted, as was a {{standard}} practice for conductors prior to {{the second half of the}} 20th Century. Among others, he amended the orchestrations of Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Sibelius, Johann Sebastian Bach, and Brahms. For example, Stokowski revised the ending of the Romeo and Juliet Fantasy Overture, by Tchaikovsky, so it would close quietly, taking <b>his</b> <b>notion</b> from Modest Tchaikovsky's Life and Letters of Peter Ilych Tchaikovsky (translated by Rosa Newmarch: 1906) that the composer had provided a quiet ending of his own at Balakirev's suggestion. Stokowski made his own orchestration of Mussorgsky's Night on Bald Mountain by adapting Rimsky-Korsakov's orchestration and making it sound, in some places, similar to Mussorgsky's original. In the film Fantasia, to conform to the Disney artists' story-line, depicting the battle between good and evil, the ending of Night on Bald Mountain segued into the beginning of Schubert's Ave Maria.|$|E
25|$|It may be {{difficult}} to see where simultaneity came into the Doppler shift calculation, and indeed the calculation is often preferred because one does {{not have to worry about}} simultaneity. As seen above, the ship twin can convert his received Doppler-shifted rate to a slower rate of the clock of the distant clock for both red and blue images. If he ignores simultaneity, he might say his twin was aging at the reduced rate throughout the journey and therefore should be younger than he is. He is now back to square one, and has to take into account the change in <b>his</b> <b>notion</b> of simultaneity at the turnaround. The rate he can calculate for the image (corrected for Doppler effect) is the rate of the Earth twin's clock at the moment it was sent, not at the moment it was received. Since he receives an unequal number of red and blue shifted images, he should realize that the red and blue shifted emissions were not emitted over equal time periods for the Earth twin, and therefore he must account for simultaneity at a distance.|$|E

500|$|Durkheim defines {{morality}} as [...] "a {{system of}} rules for conduct." [...] His analysis of morality is strongly marked by Immanuel Kant and <b>his</b> <b>notion</b> of duty.

500|$|The {{novel is}} a roman à clef; the {{characters}} are based on real people of Hemingway's circle, and the action is based on real events. In the novel, Hemingway presents <b>his</b> <b>notion</b> that the [...] "Lost Generation", considered to have been decadent, dissolute and irretrievably damaged by World War I, was resilient and strong. Additionally, Hemingway investigates the themes of love, death, renewal in nature, {{and the nature of}} masculinity.|$|E
500|$|Paul Whiteman was {{the most}} popular bandleader of the 1920s, and claimed for himself the title [...] "The King of Jazz." [...] Despite his hiring many of the other best white jazz musicians of the era, later generations of jazz lovers have often judged Whiteman's music to {{have little to do with}} real jazz. Nonetheless, <b>his</b> <b>notion</b> of {{combining}} jazz with elaborate orchestrations has been returned to repeatedly by composers and arrangers of later decades.|$|E

500|$|Although the {{immediate}} influence of Cage's procedures {{did not last}} in Takemitsu's music—Coral Island, for example for soprano and orchestra (1962) shows significant departures from indeterminate procedures {{partly as a result}} of Takemitsu's renewed interest in the music of Anton Webern—certain similarities between Cage's philosophies and Takemitsu's thought remained. For example, Cage's emphasis on timbres within individual sound-events, and <b>his</b> <b>notion</b> of silence [...] "as plenum rather than vacuum", can be aligned with Takemitsu's interest in ma. Furthermore, Cage's interest in Zen practice (through his contact with Zen scholar Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki) seems to have resulted in a renewed interest in the East in general, and ultimately alerted Takemitsu to the potential for incorporating elements drawn from Japanese traditional music into his composition: ...|$|E
500|$|Heldal-Lund {{chose the}} name [...] "Operation Clambake" [...] for the organization, as a {{reference}} to statements made by L. Ron Hubbard in which Hubbard wrote that the problems of human beings today {{are a result of}} traumatic events experienced by them as spiritual beings when they inhabited the bodies of clams during Earth's evolution. In Hubbard's Scientology: A History of Man, he asserts humans follow <b>his</b> <b>notion</b> of the [...] "genetic line" [...] of the [...] "genetic entity", which include clams (as well as sloths, volcanoes, and a [...] "sense of being eaten"), and certain human psychological problems descend from difficulties these clams experienced. Hubbard defined [...] "genetic line" [...] as a collection of the total [...] "incidents" [...] which occurred during the evolution of what Scientology refers to as the [...] "MEST body".|$|E
500|$|<b>His</b> <b>notion</b> of {{the unity}} of all mankind that appealed to {{everyone}} was very congruous with Sufi Islam.

[...] "This belief was entirely in keeping with ... the teachings of Sufis, who believed that the light of God exists in every creature, indeed in every particle of His creation." [...] Sai Baba urged his Hindu followers to read their holy books and find their own path. For him, all paths were equally valid, [...] "Ishwar" [...] (the Hindu God) and [...] "Allah" [...] being synonymous. People coming to his abode were so taken aback to see Hindus, Muslims, and others living together so peacefully that in many in-stances it changed their entire lives and belief systems.|$|E
