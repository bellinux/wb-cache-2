40|$|A {{quantitative}} and analytical investigation on the conduction mechanism in p-type cuprous oxide (Cu$_{ 2 }$O) thin films is performed based on {{analysis of the}} relative dominance of trap-limited and grain-boundary-limited conduction. It is found that carrier transport in as-deposited Cu$_{ 2 }$O is governed by grain-boundary-limited conduction (GLC), while after <b>high-temperature</b> <b>annealing,</b> GLC becomes insignificant and trap-limited conduction (TLC) dominates. This suggests that the very low Hall mobility of as-deposited Cu$_{ 2 }$O is due to significant GLC, and the Hall mobility enhancement by <b>high-temperature</b> <b>annealing</b> is determined by TLC. Evaluation of the grain size and the energy barrier height at the grain boundary shows {{an increase in the}} grain size and a considerable decrease in the energy barrier height after <b>high-temperature</b> <b>annealing,</b> which is considered to be the cause of the significant reduction in the GLC effect. Additionally, the density of copper vacancies was extracted; this quantitatively shows that an increase in annealing temperature leads to a reduction in copper vacancies.

40|$|The {{minority}} carrier lifetime in boron-doped oxygen-contaminated Czochralski (Cz) silicon is strongly reduced under illumination or carrier injection. This {{process can be}} fully reversed by a 200 degrees C anneal step. In several recent studies it was shown that boron and oxygen are the major components of the underlying metastable Cz-specific defect. The energy level of the defect in its active state A {{was determined to be}} around midgap [Schmidt et al., J. Appl. Phys. 86, 3175 (1999) ] while the energy level of the defect in its passive state P is very shallow. The Cz-specific defect in its passive state can be identified with the shallow thermal donor. The kinetics of the excess carrier-induced transformation from state P to state A can be described using recombination-enhanced defect reaction theory. On the basis of these experimental facts different solutions for the reduction or elimination of the metastable defect are suggested. Two promising solutions are discussed in more detail: the use of gallium-doped Cz silicon and the introduction of <b>high-temperature</b> <b>anneals</b> into the process sequence. Gallium-doped Cz silicon shows no degradation and excellent lifetimes over a wide resistivity range, although the concentration of interstitial oxygen is in the same range as in standard Cz silicon.

This {{process can be}} fully reversed by a 200 °C anneal step. In a couple of recent studies it was shown that boron and oxygen are the major components of the underlying metastable Cz-specific defect. The energy level of the defect in its active state, A, {{was determined to be}} between E(ind v) + 0. 35 eV and E(ind c) - 0. 45 eV (Schmidt et al. [1], 1999). In this work we show that the energy of the defect in its passive state, P, is very shallow. The kinetic of the carrier-induced transformation from state P to A was analyzed in more detail. The measured defect generation data can be described using recombination-enhanced defect reaction (REDR) theory. On the base of this analytical facts different solutions for the reduction or elimination of the metastable defect are suggested.
