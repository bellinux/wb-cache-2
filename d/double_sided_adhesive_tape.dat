The photocatalytic activity study of immobilized/TiO 2 and immobilized/TiO 2 /PEG were carried out by irradiating of 36 mg L- 1 MB dye {{in the presence of}} normal and visible light with rate of decolourization was estimated from aliquot concentration spectrophotometrically.

An active photocatalytic activity was observed for immobilized/TiO 2 /PEG sample while no photocatalytic activity detected under immobilized/TiO 2. The high photoactivity was also detected under normal light for immobilized/TiO 2 /PEG sample. This might be due to the presence of electron conjugate in PEG that acted as electron donor for TiO 2 thus increase the photocatalysis process.

Hence, a comparison study between two types of immobilized photocatalysts namely titanium dioxide (TiO 2) and TiO 2 mixed with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) has been conducted in this work to observe the significant effect of PVA polymer in photocatalysis reaction of reactive red 4 (RR 4) dye. <b>Double</b> <b>sided</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>tape</b> (DSAT) was used as thin layer binder in this immobilization system.

40|$|The {{past few}} years have seen great {{interest}} and advances in scientific research on fluorescence-based microfluidic optical sensors for clinical/medical applications. In particular, the growing demand for point-of-care-testing (POCT) devices to be applied near the patient’s bed, has driven the development of simple to use, reliable and low cost microfluidic optical platforms. The main objective of the research project presented in this thesis {{is the development of}} a novel fluorescence-based microfluidic optical chip for the simultaneous analysis of different analytes and its integration into a stand-alone POCT device. The work was undertaken in the framework of the EU project NANODEM (NANOphotonic Device for Multiple therapeutic drug monitoring - FP 7 -ICT- 2011) that aims at developing a POCT device for the measurement of immunosuppressants in transplanted patients, characterized by a narrow therapeutic range and serious potential side effects. The benefit of this device will be an optimized dosage of the therapeutic drugs to support patient management in a clinical environment. In particular, the system will accurately measure the patient blood drug free fraction, which is considered the active fraction in terms of both drug effect and toxicity. In order to reach the low limit of detection required by the clinicians and enable the detection of the therapeutic drug free fraction, a heterogeneous binding inhibition immunoassay has been developed which makes use of antibody-coated fluorescent and magnetic nanoparticles. The microfluidic optical chip, which exploits total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) and fluorescence anisotropy, is constituted by an array of microfluidic channels whose surface is chemically modified with the analyte derivative. The excitation light, coming from an external source, is properly coupled and confined by total internal reflection into the optical waveguide constituting the chip, and is guided towards the sensing area. After binding with the analyte derivative immobilised on the microchannel surface, the fluorescent-magnetic nanoparticles, coated with the analyte-specific antibodies, can be excited by means of the evanescent field, which arises at the waveguide/chip surface, and the emitted fluorescence can be collected by means of large area photodiodes. A thorough study on the excitation and emission of a fluorophore near a dielectric interface was undertaken theoretically and experimentally in order to optimize the microfluidic chip design for the best fluorescence collection efficiency. Different materials have been also investigated and several chip prototypes have been realized and characterized. The final microfluidic optical chip consists of three different polymeric parts bonded together: a thin Zeonor foil (188 µm thick, R. I. = 1. 53) which is used as excitation waveguide, a <b>double</b> <b>side</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>tape</b> (140 µm thick, R. I. = 1. 49), in which ten channels are structured by laser cutting and in which the heterogeneous inhibition binding immunoassay is performed, and a Zeonex slide (1 mm thick, R. I = 1. 51). The developed microfluidic optical chip is capable of performing the simultaneous analysis of three different selected analytes (Tacrolimus, Cyclosporin A and Mycophenolic acid), each of them measured three times in three different channels with an additional channel for waste flowing. One of the main challenges of the work is to make the microfluidic optical chip easy to use and easy to integrate with different functional elements into a POCT device. These elements include the optoelectronic system (for both the excitation and the detection of the fluorescent signal), the magnetic trapping system (for the attraction and confinement of magnetic and fluorescent nanoparticles within the sensing area), and the fluidic system (for the automatic management of samples and reagents). Specifically, for the optoelectronic excitation system, different laser sources and different optical arrangements for the in-coupling of the light into the excitation waveguide have been experimentally evaluated and tested. An optimized butt-coupling illumination system based on an optical fibre bundle has been finally developed and integrated with the microfluidic chip. As second step of integration, the optical acquisition system, constituted of amorphous large area silicon (a-Si:H) photodiodes, absorption optical filters and readout electronics, has been properly developed in collaboration with the partners of the project. In order to favour the interaction between the fluorescent magnetic nanoparticles and the sensing layer, two magnetic trapping strategies based on current line structures (magnetic coils) and on permanent magnets have been evaluated, and a permanent magnet platform has been properly designed to be finally coupled with the microfluidic optical chip. The automatic management of the fluidics is an essential requirement for the development of POCT devices: {{from this point of view}} a fluidic system has been optimized for the implementation of the heterogeneous assay into the channels of the chip. A laboratory version of the integrated system has been developed and it can be considered as a transition setup. The final NANODEM POCT device has been finally manufactured and its functionality has been evaluated...|$|R

Zircons from 2. 71 Ga partial melt segregation G 03 / 38 formed in a small (3 ̆c 1 3 ̆em(3)), closed system within a mafic rock under high pressure granulite facies conditions. Results of 14 Ti analyses present a mean apparent zircon crystallization temperature of 679 +/- 11 degrees C, underestimating independent garnet-clinopyroxene thermometry by 20 - 50 degrees C but consistent with reduced a(TiO 2) in this system. 36 spot analysis on 15 zircons from 3. 81 Ga meta-tonalite G 97 / 18, with an estimated magmatic temperature 3 ̆e 1000 degrees C, yield a low-temperature focused normal distribution with a mean of 683 +/- 32 degrees C, further demonstrated by high resolution Ti mapping of two individual grains. This distribution is interpreted to represent the temperature of the residual magma at zircon saturation, late in the crystallization history of the tonalite. Hypothetically, Ti-in-zircon thermometry on Eoarchaean detrital zircons sourced from such a high temperature tonalite would present a low-temperature biased image of the host magma, which could be misconstrued as being a minimum melt granite. Multiple analyses from individual zircons can yield complex Ti distributions and associated apparent temperature patterns, reflecting cooling history and local chemical environments in large magma chambers. In addition to inclusions and crystal imperfections, which can yield apparent high temperature anomalies, zircon surfaces can also record extreme (3 ̆e 1000 degrees C) apparent Ti temperatures.

40|$|A passive, {{economical}} {{and easy}} to assemble thermal insulation blanket {{has been designed to}} protect micro, nano and pico satellites, and their payloads as well. The structure of the Multi Layer Insulation (MLI) system has been simplified using Components Off The Shelf (COTS), so that it is composed of two types of layers: the reflective layers and the separator layers. The layers are bonded together using Kapton, glass fiber tape and a bi-adhesive tape. The reflective layers are made of Mylar polyester film, typically used in first-aid kits. The separator layers, used to prevent thermal conduction between the reflective layers, consist of a glass-fiber net used in building constructions, namely for wall plastering. The fibers are crossed together to form a mesh about 3 x 6 mm in size. Several samples have been manufactured, with the size of 22 x 22 cm, in order to fit inside the thermo-vacuum chamber of the LARES-lab at the School of Aerospace Engineering. Each sample differs from the others by the number of layers, with a maximum thickness of 2 mm. The performances of this MLI system have been evaluated. Each sample has been tested in high vacuum (< 10 − 5 mbar), and temperatures {{on both sides of the}} sample have been recorded before and during the activation of a SpectrosunXT- 10 Type II solar simulator. The test procedure, applied on all the samples, consisted in measuring the temperatures reached at the equilibrium but also in monitoring the transient during vacuum creation and during the heating of the sample. Two Platinum Resistance Thermometers were placed in the center of each side of the sample; the thermometers were fixed to the surface by means of a thermal conductive <b>double</b> <b>sided</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>tape.</b> Two additional sensors were placed on the walls of the vacuum chamber. The highest recorded temperature on the front- facing layers of a tested specimen was 161. 9 o C.

Heat transfer was reduced through the use of a larger number of layers in the sample, as well as by varying the front surface emissivity. The tests demonstrated that the COTS-composed MLI system has both good insulation properties and good resistance in space environment.

These forces could be directly applied to the <b>adhesive</b> <b>tape</b> itself as in attempting to peel the tape off or could be applied indirectly to the tape through manipulation of the substrate to which the <b>adhesive</b> <b>tape</b> is adhered. The latter is demonstrated in the figure to the right. It must be noted that the figure is assuming the <b>adhesive</b> <b>tape</b> is holding two separate substrate pieces together and that twisting of both pieces in opposite directions has not been noted.|$|R
