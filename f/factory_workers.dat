5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19thcentury and the {{beginning}} of the 20thcentury, the focus of Russian feminism shifted from the aristocracy to the peasants and working class. Imbued with socialist ideology, young women began to organize all-women unions among female <b>factory</b> <b>workers,</b> who tended to be ignored or marginalized by male socialists.|$|E
5|$|Crinolines {{were worn}} by women of every social {{standing}} and class across the Western world, from royalty to <b>factory</b> <b>workers.</b> This led to widespread media scrutiny and criticism, particularly in satirical magazines such as Punch. They were also hazardous if worn without due care. Thousands of women {{died in the}} mid-19th century {{as a result of}} their hooped skirts catching fire. Alongside fire, other hazards included the hoops being caught in machinery, carriage wheels, gusts of wind, or other obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Croatia has a {{universal}} health care system, whose roots {{can be traced back}} to the Hungarian-Croatian Parliament Act of 1891, providing a form of mandatory insurance of all <b>factory</b> <b>workers</b> and craftsmen. The population is covered by a basic health insurance plan provided by statute and optional insurance. In 2012, annual healthcare related expenditures reached 21.0billion kuna (€2.8billion). Healthcare expenditures comprise only 0.6% of private health insurance and public spending. In 2010, Croatia spent 6.9% of its GDP on healthcare.|$|E

5|$|He next {{turned to}} the subject of wartime female <b>factory</b> <b>workers</b> in The Most Beautiful, a {{propaganda}} film which he shot in a semi-documentary style in early 1944. In order to coax realistic performances from his actresses, the director had them live in a real factory during the shoot, eat the factory food and call each other by their character names. He would use similar methods with his performers throughout his career.|$|E
5|$|In rural areas, women {{traditionally}} work alongside {{their family}} to produce crops like tea and rice. In urban areas, women work in factories, living away from home. Most of these <b>factory</b> <b>workers</b> are young girls who send their income to their families. To help maintain {{the rights of}} women in factories, labor unions and organizations were built. In their homes, women take care of their children and cook.|$|E
5|$|On Cape Cod, Vonnegut made most of {{his money}} writing pieces for {{magazines}} such as Collier's, The Saturday Evening Post, and Cosmopolitan. He also did a stint as an English teacher, wrote copy for an advertising agency, and opened the first American Saab dealership, which eventually failed. In 1952, Vonnegut's first novel, Player Piano, was published by Scribner's. The novel has a post-Third World War setting, in which <b>factory</b> <b>workers</b> {{have been replaced by}} machines.|$|E

5|$|As the Second World War progressed, Sellers {{continued}} {{to develop his}} drumming skills, and played {{with a series of}} touring bands, including those of Oscar Rabin, Henry Hall and Waldini, as well as his father's quartet, before he left and joined a band from Blackpool. Sellers {{became a member of the}} Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA), which provided entertainment for British forces and <b>factory</b> <b>workers</b> during the war. Sellers also performed comedy routines at these concerts, including impersonations of George Formby, with Sellers accompanying his own singing on ukulele.|$|E
5|$|During production, {{the actress}} playing {{the leader of}} the <b>factory</b> <b>workers,</b> Yōko Yaguchi, was chosen by her colleagues to present their demands to the director. She and Kurosawa were {{constantly}} at loggerheads, and it was through these arguments that the two, paradoxically, became close. They married on May 21, 1945, with Yaguchi two months pregnant (she never resumed her acting career), and the couple would remain together until her death in 1985. They would have two children: a son, Hisao, born December 20, 1945, who would serve as producer on some of his father's last projects, and Kazuko, a daughter, born April 29, 1954, who would become a costume designer.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 19th century {{the growth of}} {{industry}} meant {{the majority of the}} area's inhabitants were employed in textiles or trade, while a minority worked in agriculture. The factory system was also introduced; in 1835 1,124people were employed in cotton mills, and two mills used power looms. Local hand-produced specialities included striped cotton ticks, checks, Nankeens and Camrays. Two cotton mills are visible on the 1845 Ordnance Survey map of the area. The area also became renowned for its production of silk, with two mills at Eccles and one at Patricroft. Many <b>factory</b> <b>workers</b> were children under 12years of age.|$|E

5|$|Feminism in Russia {{originated}} in the 18thcentury, influenced by the Western European Enlightenment and mostly confined to the aristocracy. Throughout the 19thcentury, the idea of feminism remained closely tied to revolutionary politics and to social reform. In the 20thcentury Russian feminists, inspired by socialist doctrine, shifted their focus from philanthropic works to organizing among peasants and <b>factory</b> <b>workers.</b> After the February Revolution of 1917, feminist lobbying gained suffrage and nominal equality for women in education and the workplace; however, in the 1960s and 1970s, women continued to experience discrimination in certain career-paths (including politics) as well as income inequality and a greater burden of household work. In spite of this, the concern with feminism waned during this period.|$|E
5|$|Human {{productivity}} routinely {{decreases in}} the afternoon. Power plants have shown significant reductions in productivity {{in the afternoon}} compared to the morning, the largest differences occurring on Saturdays and the smallest on Mondays. One 1950s study covering two female <b>factory</b> <b>workers</b> for six months found that their productivity was 13 percent lower in the afternoon, the least productive time being their last hour at work. It was summarized that the differences came from personal breaks and unproductive activities at the workplace. Another, larger study found that afternoon declines in productivity were greater during longer work shifts.|$|E
5|$|Many American {{newspapers}} criticized Missouri for the Haun's Mill massacre and the state's {{expulsion of}} the Latter Day Saints. Illinois accepted Mormon refugees who gathered {{along the banks}} of the Mississippi River, where Smith purchased high-priced, swampy woodland in the hamlet of Commerce. Smith also attempted to portray the Latter Day Saints as an oppressed minority, and unsuccessfully petitioned the federal government for help in obtaining reparations. During the summer of 1839, while Latter Day Saints in Nauvoo suffered from a malaria epidemic, Smith sent Brigham Young and other apostles to missions in Europe, where they made numerous converts, many of them poor <b>factory</b> <b>workers.</b>|$|E

5|$|Social {{commentary}} was {{a feature}} of Chaplin's films from early in his career, as he portrayed the underdog in a sympathetic light and highlighted the difficulties of the poor. Later, as he developed {{a keen interest in}} economics and felt obliged to publicise his views, Chaplin began incorporating overtly political messages into his films. Modern Times (1936) depicted <b>factory</b> <b>workers</b> in dismal conditions, The Great Dictator (1940) parodied Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini and ended in a speech against nationalism, Monsieur Verdoux (1947) criticised war and capitalism, and A King in New York (1957) attacked McCarthyism.|$|E
5|$|The {{crinoline}} {{was worn}} by some <b>factory</b> <b>workers,</b> {{leading to the}} textiles firm Courtaulds instructing female employees in 1860 to leave their hoops and crinolines at home. Cunnington described seeing a photograph of female employees in the Bryant and May match factories wearing crinolines while at work. A report in The Cork Examiner of 2 June 1864 recorded the death of Ann Rollinson from injuries sustained after her crinoline was caught by a revolving machinery shaft in a mangling room at Firwood bleach works.|$|E
5|$|The {{massacre}} at Kraljevo, {{as well as}} a similar and nearly concurrent massacre in nearby Kragujevac, convinced German commanders that mass killings of Serbian hostages were not only ineffectual but also counterproductive, as they drove locals into the hands of insurgents and sometimes resulted in the deaths of <b>factory</b> <b>workers</b> contributing to the German war effort. Following the war, several senior German military officials were tried and convicted for their involvement in the reprisal shootings at the Nuremberg Trials and the Subsequent Nuremberg trials.|$|E

5|$|There is {{a sizable}} Serbian American {{diaspora}} in the United States; in 2007 {{a total of}} 172,834 people of Serbian nationality or descent were recorded to be inhabiting the U.S. The first documented wave of Serbian immigrants to the United States was recorded in the 1970s when many Serbian <b>factory</b> <b>workers</b> emigrated to Detroit to manufacture automobiles for Ford. In 2011, Serbia was ranked second in the world (after Guinea Bissau) in human capital flight according to USAID. Brain drain to the United States and Canada has been cited as a chronic phenomenon in Serbia, especially from 1990 to 2000 during the decade of UN sanctions and war.|$|E
5|$|Although Golos Truda sharply {{criticized the}} anarchist communists of Petrograd as romantics, {{ignorant of the}} complex social forces of the Revolution among Petrograd's Bolshevik-supporting <b>factory</b> <b>workers,</b> {{the ideas of the}} union and its paper were {{considered}} bizarre and met with little initial success. Despite this, the anarcho-syndicalist union persisted and gradually acquired a degree of influence, focusing its efforts through propaganda in Golos Truda, with the intent of capturing the attention of the public with its ideals and by differentiating itself from the other radical factions. The paper's circulation continuing to increase in the city and its provinces, with robust anarcho-syndicalist collectives and meetings emerging in Kronstadt, Oboukhovo, and Kolpino. In March 1918, the Bolsheviks moved the seat of government from Petrograd to Moscow, and the anarchists swiftly followed, moving the printing of Golos Truda to the new capital.|$|E
5|$|Charlie {{is pouring}} {{his own money}} into the factory to ensure it will be ready in time for Milan, and he is getting frantic that the product is not right, angrily forcing his staff to redo what he {{considers}} to be shoddy work. Nicola arrives, fed up with Charlie's obsession over the factory, and breaks up with him. Lola has been making some decisions about production and preparations without consulting Charlie. When he discovers that she has decided to have her angels wear the boots on the runway rather than hiring professional models, an overwhelmed Charlie lashes out at her, humiliating {{her in front of}} the other workers. Lola storms out, and the <b>factory</b> <b>workers</b> go home. Alone, Charlie struggles with the weight of his father's legacy and what it means to be his own man ("Soul of a Man").|$|E
