5|$|Although many {{publications}} have repeated Doyle's unsupported {{assertion that}} the wartime photograph inspired Miller's poster, Westinghouse historian Charles A. Ruch, a Pittsburgh resident who had been friends with J. Howard Miller, said that Miller {{was not in the}} habit of working <b>from</b> <b>photographs,</b> but rather live models. Penny Coleman, the author of Rosie the Riveter: Women working on the home front in World War II, said that she and Ruch could not determine whether the wartime photo had appeared in any of the periodicals that Miller would have seen.|$|E
5|$|For a phylum with {{relatively}} few species, ctenophores {{have a wide}} range of body plans. Coastal species need to be tough enough to withstand waves and swirling sediment particles, while some oceanic species are so fragile that {{it is very difficult to}} capture them intact for study. In addition oceanic species do not preserve well, and are known mainly <b>from</b> <b>photographs</b> and from observers' notes. Hence most attention has until recently concentrated on three coastal genera – Pleurobrachia, Beroe and Mnemiopsis. At least two textbooks base their descriptions of ctenophores on the cydippid Pleurobrachia.|$|E
5|$|Enter the Voids {{post-production}} process lasted {{more than}} a year. Work on the digital effects was led by Pierre Buffin of BUF Compagnie. Every scene in the film includes computer-generated imagery (CGI)—even the flashback scenes, where the backdrops were digitally altered. Studio scenes, helicopter shots, and CGI were forged together in the hovering sequences with the intention that the viewer should be unable to determine which is which. For shots from high altitudes, the team started with helicopter footage from video, and then created computer models of the neighbourhoods with textures <b>from</b> <b>photographs.</b> Neon lights, reflections, and dark areas were consistently accentuated. Flickers were created through a mixture of motion blur, chromatic aberration, and focus effects. For scenes seen as through a fisheye lens, the team recreated the sets digitally and progressively increased the environments' reflection values along with the lens effect.|$|E

5|$|The team {{designed}} venues {{that represented}} {{parts of the}} Beatles' history {{in order to create}} an atmosphere of authenticity. For example, the set of The Ed Sullivan Show was recreated <b>from</b> <b>photographs</b> and videos, including a rare color photograph in Apple's collection that showed the yellow tint used to enhance the video as shown on black-and-white television sets. The Cavern Club, Shea Stadium, Budokan, Abbey Road Studios and the rooftop of the Apple Corps Headquarters also appear as venues in the game. Fashions of the 1960s were researched to properly apply them to the various virtual crowds at these locations.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} development which reduced Gill Sans' dominance was {{the arrival}} of phototypesetting, which allowed typefaces to be printed <b>from</b> <b>photographs</b> on film and (especially in display use – hot metal continued for some body text setting for longer) massively increased the range of typefaces that could cheaply be used. Dry transfers like Letraset had a similar effect for smaller projects; their sans-serif Compacta and Stephenson Blake's Impact exemplified the design trends of the period by choosing dense, industrial designs. Of the period from the 1930s to 1950s, {{when he was growing}} up, James Mosley would later write: The Monotype classics dominated the typographical landscape... in Britain, at any rate, they were so ubiquitous that, while their excellent quality was undeniable, it was possible to be bored by them and to begin to rebel against the bland good taste that they represented. In fact we were already aware by 1960 that they might not be around to bore us for too long. The death of metal type... seemed at last to be happening.|$|E
5|$|When the Kindred escort {{the agents}} {{out of the}} village, Mulder {{comments}} {{on the lack of}} children in the community and states that he recognizes some of the faces <b>from</b> <b>photographs</b> taken in the 1930s. Curious, he returns to the village that night, and hears chanting as a procession of the Kindred moves to a barn. Scully is led off by Brother Andrew, who claims {{to be able to give}} her information about the murderer, whom he calls Brother Martin. Downstairs in the barn, the group can be seen bathing Brother Aaron's body in watery clay. Mulder hides in a crevice, where he discovers that the sick man has been buried alive and has begun to take on feminine features. Meanwhile, Brother Andrew uses his power to seduce Scully. She is unable to resist, and is on the verge of succumbing before Mulder comes to her aid. The agents are again escorted out of the village.|$|E

25|$|The boho look, which owed {{much to the}} hippie {{styles that}} {{developed}} in the middle to late 1960s, became especially popular after Sienna Miller's appearance at the Glastonbury Festival in 2004, although some of its features were apparent <b>from</b> <b>photographs</b> of her taken in October 2003 and of others living in or around the postal district of W10 (North Kensington), an area of London associated with bohemian culture since the mid-1950s.|$|E
25|$|Collage made <b>from</b> <b>photographs,</b> {{or parts}} of photographs, is called photomontage. Photomontage is the process (and result) of making a {{composite}} photograph by cutting and joining {{a number of other}} photographs. The composite picture was sometimes photographed so that the final image is converted back into a seamless photographic print. The same method is accomplished today using image-editing software. The technique is referred to by professionals as compositing.|$|E

30|$|Given that images {{increase}} data traffic, {{there have}} been a number of studies on the reconstruction of video conferences by extracting and transmitting only a user's features <b>from</b> <b>photographed</b> images.

Here, a depth-map was extracted <b>from</b> the <b>photographed</b> images, and then, a distance user was represented. In other studies on virtual humans for video conferences, body features were extracted <b>from</b> <b>photographed</b> images [1]. After locating the body positions by identifying the hands and face, the body positions were transmitted. Then, the virtual human gestures by referencing the transmitted body positions.|$|R
