Stewart agrees to please Charlotte, and returns home to the flat he shares with his sister, Imogen. After Imogen goes out for the evening, Stewart puts the video on.

Then the video returns to what was partly recorded over – a pornographic video – [...] and Stewart watches <b>in</b> <b>amazement.</b> Imogen, in the meantime, spends the whole evening waiting for a date from a dating agency who fails to turn up.

2500|$|At 17:30, the Australian {{official}} history {{reported that}} 500 German infantry supported by self-propelled guns attacked in force along {{the width of}} the 2/8th's sector. A German participant of the battle, Obersturmbannfuhrer Kurt Meyer, wrote later of his surprise at how easily the heavy StuGs had climbed the slopes. [...] "We watched the guns advance <b>in</b> <b>amazement.</b> They climbed higher and higher, and then joined the fight. Nobody [...] thought it possible to use them, but now they were up there, giving valuable support to the infantry. Completely shaken by the impression German shelling had made on them, British [...] prisoners came down the mountain. They were tall, strong fellows and formidable opponents." [...] The self-propelled guns effectively sealed the Allies' defeat at Vevi. The 2/8th Battalion was forced into a chaotic retreat, with component units being separated and officers ordering the abandonment even of light weapons, to speed the withdrawal. Losses among the Australian infantry would have been much worse {{it were not for the}} 2/1st Anti-Tank Regiment and the British Royal Horse Artillery standing their ground in the centre, until the Germans were only [...] away.|$|E

2500|$|In 1796, Byron {{suffered}} from scarlet fever, {{and his mother}} {{took him to the}} Scottish Highlands to stay in the mountains until his recovery. This experience affected Byron greatly, as he described in his poetry, especially his memory of the mountain of Lochnagar and a girl named Mary. He soon fell in love with another Mary, a cousin, and would still think of her until he was 27. On 21 May 1798, the death of Byron's great-uncle, the [...] "wicked" [...] Lord Byron, allowed the 10-year-old to become the 6th Baron Byron; he inherited the Rochdale estate in Lancashire, and Newstead Abbey in Nottinghamshire, coming under the care of his relative, Frederick Howard, Earl of Carlisle. Byron noticed no difference in how he was treated until the first time he was given the title dominus (meaning 'lord') in class; he was struck speechless and burst into tears while the other schoolchildren sat <b>in</b> <b>amazement.</b> However, little money came with the inheritance, as his great-uncle had already squandered most of his fortune; the fifth Lord Byron had sold the Rochdale estate illegally, and more money had to be put into a legal battle to restore Rochdale to Byron.|$|E
2500|$|Harry Potter {{has been}} parodied several {{times on the}} US sketch comedy Saturday Night Live. In all sketches, Harry is portrayed by Rachel Dratch except for the [...] "Welcome Back Potter" [...] sketch in which Harry is played by Will Forte. In {{addition}} Hermione Granger was played by Lindsay Lohan, who wore a revealing sweater that showed {{a good deal of}} her breasts, causing Harry and Ron, then the Weasley twins, and even Snape and Hagrid to gawk at her <b>in</b> <b>amazement</b> and lust. (The boys decide to use the Invisibility Cloak to spy on Hermione in the bath.) This was to parody the fact that Hermione had reached puberty. A recent sketch featuring J. K. Rowling (played by Amy Poehler) showed deleted scenes from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban where Albus Dumbledore (played by Bill Hader) acts gay. Most recently, Daniel Radcliffe portrayed Potter in a sketch where it has been ten years since his Graduation (though this was never shown in the books), and is still at Hogwarts as a tenant. Potter meets new students and realizes Ron and Hermione have become professors.|$|E
2500|$|Wilder {{would later}} recall with {{disappointment}} {{his first meeting}} with Chandler. Envisioning a former private detective who had worked his own experiences into gritty prose, he instead met a man he would later describe as looking like an accountant. Chandler was new to Hollywood, but saw it as a golden opportunity. Not realizing that he would be collaborating with Wilder, he demanded $1,000 and said he would need at least a week to complete the screenplay, to which Wilder and Sistrom simply looked at one another <b>in</b> <b>amazement.</b> To help guide him in writing a screenplay, Wilder gave Chandler a copy of his own screenplay for the 1941 Hold Back the Dawn to study. After the first weekend, Chandler presented eighty pages that Wilder characterized as [...] "useless camera instruction"; Wilder quickly put it aside and informed Chandler that they would be working together, slowly and meticulously. By all accounts, the pair did not get along during their four months together. At one point Chandler even quit, submitting a long list of grievances to Paramount as to why he could no longer work with Wilder. Wilder, however, stuck it out, admiring Chandler's gift with words and knowing that his dialogue would translate very well to the screen.|$|E
