The Chicago Daily Tribune commented that the population of most Illinois towns in 1896 would fit comfortably in the building. It was a postal district unto itself, with four full-time carriers delivering mail six times a day, six days a week.

25|$|Although Art Deco is seen {{generally}} in individual urban buildings, in the Rubber Research Institute Building it is employed for {{a complex of}} linked, single-storey buildings set in a landscaped compound. The buildings are almost modular with identical facade elements. Unlike most other examples, these buildings are in <b>facing</b> <b>brick,</b> with monumental corner piers. These piers frame the window openings, which are divided into three vertical bands by two large, protruding plaster mullions. Three horizontal rendered beams appear to be threaded through these mullions, visually tying the piers together. On the flat, recessed brick pediment, a plaster motif of layered latex sheets hanging out to dry is a witty allusion to the industry these buildings serve. The buildings are grouped around green courtyards and linked by covered masonry walkways. The walkways have amusing spout details over the beams which throw the rainwater from flat roofs. Art Deco is continued into the interior on heavy, carved timber doors and steel roof lights. This building shows the inventive, even playful, nature of the Art Deco style.|$|E

40|$|By the late-nineteenth {{century the}} brick {{industry}} was largely mechanized. In {{accordance with the}} changing technologies' capacity to produce greater numbers of increasingly uniform products (in shape, color and durability), the notion of—and market for—"face brick" changed drastically during this time. It was because of this newfound uniformity that <b>face</b> <b>brick</b> ultimately became fully differentiated from the lower-quality "common brick" product. Over the next decades, architects and builders became increasingly interested {{in the use of}} textured and multi-colored <b>face</b> <b>brick</b> for the exterior of buildings. This was a strict departure from the earlier years of largely smooth-surfaced brick production. The production of <b>face</b> <b>brick</b> was truly a national industry by the 19 -teens, and it was reported that in 1915 <b>face</b> <b>brick</b> was produced in forty-two states across the United States. The widespread location of good brickmaking clays, rail transportation, and product marketing all contributed {{to the success of the}} <b>face</b> <b>brick</b> industry. Research on this topic revolves around color, texture and size of early twentieth century <b>face</b> <b>brick</b> and explores the ways in which product trends evolved throughout the decades before and after the turn of the new century. Research has also been undertaken on the role and development of technology in production—how raw materials, equipment and methods changed to reflect evolving aesthetic trends. Production methods (soft-mud, stiff-mud, dry-press, re-press) have been investigated, as has the role of <b>face</b> <b>brick</b> manufacturers in the evolution of brick size standardization within the larger building brick industry. The rapid evolution of <b>face</b> <b>brick</b> production processes, terminology, and aesthetics over the course of approximately sixty years (1880 - 1940) created an ever-growing national <b>face</b> <b>brick</b> industry that was cemented by the 1912 establishment of the American <b>Face</b> <b>Brick</b> Association. The development of this association has been traced, revealing its early role in the aesthetic and terminological standardization of products, as well as its publication of a large number of catalogs which no doubt led to the widespread use of <b>face</b> <b>brick</b> on buildings large and small, in a multitude of urban and suburban environments across the country. In the late 1930 s, the American <b>Face</b> <b>Brick</b> Association merged with several other clay products associations to form the Structural Clay Products Institute, the predecessor of today's Brick Industry Association. This research has revealed a strong connection to not only today's preservation professionals, but to clay brick industry members such as manufacturers and distributors. Due to the historical nature of the brick trade and the lack of organized documentation of early twentieth century <b>face</b> <b>brick,</b> however, it is often difficult to visually identify, research, and subsequently reproduce a deteriorated <b>face</b> <b>brick</b> product. Knowledge of historic production methods and products is therefore essential for both preservation consultants and trade-oriented participants of a <b>face</b> <b>brick</b> restoration project, particularly as increasing numbers of <b>face</b> <b>brick</b> preservation projects are likely in the coming years...|$|R

The original section of the house, built about 1830, consists of a two-story, brick hall and parlor plan dwelling with a raised basement and a slate roof. About 1850, a north <b>facing</b> <b>brick</b> wing was added {{and the house was}} remodeled to reflect the then popular Italianate and Gothic Revival styles.

50|$|The main {{building}} of the Foothills complex, the historic First Presbyterian Church was originally built in 1872 as the southwesterly portion of the present building. Originally {{it was a small}} east-west oriented chapel with Gothic stained glass windows and brick buttresses, for the congregation founded in 1870 by the famed circuit riding minister Sheldon Jackson. The church was built on land donated by William A.H. Loveland. In 1898 the growing congregation hired prominent area architect James H. Gow to redesign and add onto the building, which transformed it into a roughly cross-shaped chapel with northeast corner bell tower, with smooth new <b>facing</b> <b>brick</b> enabling the whole to match. The place continued serving as the First Presbyterian Church until the congregation outgrew this space and moved to south Golden in 1958. The fledgling Jefferson Unitarian Church, led by C. Leon Hopper, then took over the church building, and worshipped here for 10 years until moving to their own home east of Golden in Applewood in 1968. By that time, Golden sidewalk art sales were calling attention to the need for an area art center of its own, which {{led to the creation of}} the Foothills Art Center, which took over the already artistic space.

The results show how greatly this ability depends on hydraulicity.

In practice water is abstracted due to the capillary pressure of the masonry unit and the results presented are {{discussed in terms of}} typical capillary pressures exerted by clay <b>facing</b> <b>brick.</b> Changes in desorptivity also occur with elapsed time from mixing.

40|$|Sharp front {{theory is}} used to derive an {{equation}} describing the time taken for a wet mortar joint to be dewatered by an absorbent substrate.

Experimental data are presented which validate this equation and the results show that the time to dewater a mortar depends on both the hydraulicity and the initial water content of the mix. For the practically important case of jointing mortars applied in 10 mm layers to a typical <b>facing</b> <b>brick</b> we show that dewatering times range from 20 s to 1 min for Portland cement and NHL 2 mortars, respectively, and that 40 - 60 % of the original mix water is lost in the process...|$|E

In the given work the structure of silicate brick is analyzed, questions of a technical condition, the forecast and ways of prolongation of a residual operational resource of external walls of buildings {{on the basis of}} a silicate brick of construction 40 - 70 уеаrs are considered. The analysis is made using physical and chemical methods on an example of an available housing of this category in cities of Republic Bashkortostan. The received results of a condition of buildings external walls laying allow to make a conclusion about decreasing of silicate brick external wall bearing ability for the long period of operation (? 70 years) within the limits of up to 10 - 15 % due to reduction of effective section by 7 - 12 %, decreasing in durability of a <b>facing</b> <b>brick</b> to 15 - 20 %.
