40|$|Abstract <b>Delegating</b> <b>sovereignty</b> to {{international}} organizations (IOs) is both increasingly common and controversial. I address {{the sources of}} current controversies in three claims. First, although alleged otherwise, sovereignty is eminently divisible. From practice, indivisibility {{should not be a}} barrier to delegating to IOs. Second, it is intuitive that longer chains of delegation {{will be more likely to}} fail. Yet, it is not the length of the chain per se that matters as whether identifiable conditions for successful delegation are satisfied. Third, although “delegation ” is often used to refer to both, <b>delegating</b> and pooling <b>sovereignty</b> are distinct activities. Much of the concern with IOs is really about pooling rather than <b>delegating</b> <b>sovereignty...</b>|$|R

Logically, the nature and systemic effects of international anarchy should be most apparent in relation to the smallest and weakest states, and least apparent in relation to great powers. Focusing on micro-states suggests a permissive contemporary international system facilitating the proliferation and survival of states independent of their military and functional capacities. Micro-states’ lack of great power allies illustrates the irrelevance of military threats under anarchy, while the presence of an international economic safety net attenuates problems of economic viability. The lack of association between smallness and <b>delegating</b> <b>sovereignty</b> questions functional explanations of hierarchy. Instead, varying micro-states strategies of à la carte hierarchy and selling sovereign prerogatives demonstrate that the current international system presents even its smallest and weakest members with choices rather than imperatives.

40|$|One of {{the more}} {{misunderstood}} concepts of Anglo-American law is the discovery doctrine, the principle by which Europeans rationalized their presence in North America. Misinterpretation of the doctrine led to unwarranted assumptions {{about the relationship between}} the federal government and indigenous tribes in the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries and to misinterpretations abroad, notably in Australia. These misinterpretations by judges and Congress made the discovery doctrine into what one scholar called a perfect instrument of empire. But this article maintains that this result was a perversion of the doctrine laid down in the early 19 th century by the Marshall Court. The article explains that the discovery doctrine, as articulated by the Marshall Court, actually produced very little immediate effects on native proprietary rights. However, Chief Justice Marshall laid the seeds for later misunderstandings by characterizing aboriginal title as sui generis, outside the conventional system of Anglo-America property law. In fact, had Marshall been better versed in property law, it would have been quite easy to conceptualize aboriginal title in conventional terms. Had he done so in the cases in which he used the discovery doctrine to shape native property, the federal government 2 ̆ 7 s interest in native lands would have been understood to be merely a right of preemption and the native interest to be a fee simple subject to a partial restraint on alienation. This interpretation would have been consistent with the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s oft-quoted phrase that Indian title is as sacred as the fee. The discovery doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s effect on tribal sovereignty turned out to be much more pernicious than its effect on native property rights. The doctrine not only foreclosed relations between the Indian tribes and foreign nations and led to exclusive federal control over native affairs, it also assumed that questions about federal-tribal relations were properly left to federal courts, the courts of the conqueror in Chief Justice Marshall 2 ̆ 7 s words. This decision on venue equipped Marshall 2 ̆ 7 s successors to erect a doctrine of plenary federal power on questionable authority and to use it to give sanction to unilateral federal breaching of treaties and the breaking up of the Indian land base. This article aims to clarify the discovery doctrine by examining its origins, its adoption by the Marshall Court, and its ensuing effects on native property rights and sovereignty. Among the legacies of the doctrine was an impetus to treaty-making, which enabled some tribes to reserve important natural resources for their use, so the results of the discovery doctrine were not all adverse to the tribes. The article explores the relationship between discovery and treaty-making and also a modern alternative to the erosion of inherent tribal sovereignty initiated by the discovery doctrine: <b>delegated</b> <b>sovereignty</b> under federal pollution control statutes. The article concludes that while Chief Justice Marshall would never have countenanced his successors 2 ̆ 7 interpretation of the discovery doctrine he articulated, understanding the origins, scope, and legacies of the doctrine remains foundational to native proprietary and sovereign rights in the modern world...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{two related}} puzzles confronting students of {{regional and international}} inte-gration: Why do states willingly pool and <b>delegate</b> <b>sovereignty</b> within international institutions? What accounts for the timing and content of regional integration agreements? Most theories of in-tegration suggest that states integrate in order to solve problems of incomplete information and reduce transaction costs and other barriers to economic growth. In contrast I argue that integra-tion can serve to establish a credible commitment that rules out the risk of future conflict among states of unequal power. Specifically, I suggest that integration presents an alternative to preven-tive war {{as a means to}} preclude a rising revisionist power from establishing a regional hegemony. The implication {{is that it is not}} countries enjoying stable and peaceful relations that are most likely to pursue integration, but rather countries that find themselves caught in a regional security di-lemma, which they hope to break out of by means of institutionalized cooperation.

40|$|ABSTRACT. - International {{cooperation}} {{to regulate the}} movement of people and the harmonization of migration policies at the regional level tend to advance slowly and in an ad hoc basis, mostly due to the reluctance of nation-states to <b>delegate</b> <b>sovereignty</b> on such a sensitive matter for their domestic constituencies. Nonetheless, as {{the case of the}} EU shows, such harmonization may be necessary when the economic integration process is well advanced, institutionalized, and expanding (i. e., if a single market is in place and enlarging, supranational norms and institutions are binding, and integration is to deepen). The case of MERCOSUR presents some theoretical and empirical puzzles. Although the integration process (and the analysis of it) has modeled the European experience in several respects, the bloc has been unable to move pass an imperfect custom unions stage and unwilling to develop more than a loose institutional structure. Yet, rapid advances in the harmonization of migration norms and policies have occurred in the last decade, apparently driven by factors that lie outside the economic integration realm and remain relatively unexplored. This study focuses on the different speed, modality, and driving forces behind the relationship between regional integration and migration policies in the EU and MERCOSUR. The comparison aims at making a contribution to our understanding the mechanisms that unable or constraint policy convergence in highly sensitive areas such as migration; it also explores the applicability of some concepts usually used to study regional integration across regions...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} half century, the European Parliament has {{undergone}} a remarkable transformation from an assembly endowed with supervisory powers to a directly-elected legislator, co-deciding most secondary legislation on equal footing with the Council. Furthermore, while human rights were not institutionalized in the founding Treaties, the European Court of Justice began to make references to fundamental rights in its jurisprudence since the late sixties, and the recent past has seen the codification of fundamental rights in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Under what conditions have the parliamentarization and the institutionalization of human rights at the EU level progressed? We explain the constitutionalization of the EU – parliamentarization and the institutionalization of human rights – as strategic action in a community environment. According to this approach, community actors use the liberal democratic identity, values and norms that constitute the EU’s ethos strategically to put social and moral pressure on those community members that oppose the constitutionalization of the EU. We find that salience {{has been the most}} relevant condition for triggering incremental constitutionalization: The more a proposed or implemented decision by the member states to pool or <b>delegate</b> <b>sovereignty</b> is perceived to curb the competencies of national parliaments and to undermine national or other international human rights provisions, the more salient the “legitimacy deficit” of European integration becomes. This state of affairs, in turn, generates normative pressure on EU actors to redress the situation through strengthening the powers of the EP and human rights provisions at the EU level. polity building; European Parliament; fundamental/human rights; legitimacy...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus is}} on the Mekong River Commission’s (MRC) {{governance}} of the resources of the Mekong River and its tributaries. The great economic growth over the last years in the South East Asia has increased the demand for energy correspondingly. The way to fulfill these increased energy demands is to a large extent expected to be meet through the generation of hydroelectric energy. In the last two decades hydropower dams have been constructed on the Mekong tributaries with huge consequences for the surroundings, and not more than a month ago was the Nam Theun II dam in Lao PDR completed both altering the flow of the river up- and downstream, with consequences for over 120. 000 peoples living along its banks. The MRC was finally established by Thailand, Cambodia, Lao PDR and Vietnam in 1995, with the goal to secure a sustainable development and an equal utilization of resources between the four member states. However, an investigation {{of the structure of the}} MRC and the formulations of the mutual agreement, has given a clear indication that the MRC in practical terms does not have any authoritative to approve or disapprove proposed projects. Most recently the MRC has been asked to assist in the formulation of a Strategic Impact Assessments on 11 hydropower proposals on the Mekong Mainstream. However evidence indicates that projects are so far ahead, that the conclusions here will be of no importance to the decision makers. The question is whether the MRC member states are prepared to <b>delegate</b> <b>sovereignty</b> to the mutual governance for a sustainable development in the future? - or whether they will keep utilizing the resources until total depletion? – the tragedy of the commons...|$|R

The new means of communication, especially the Internet, give the citizen the possibility to be closer to the decisions taken by the legislator. The building of a “virtual agora” in which citizens are asked to participate directly to their own governing seems an achievable dream. Main difficulties towards such an ambitious goal are no longer of a technological nature, but of transforming the traditional law making process, the somehow rigid essential characteristics that the rule of law must have, with the direct exercise of sovereignty, by the citizens, if not in all matters, at least at a local, administrative level...|$|R

40|$|In Pennsylvania the Indian trade became deeply {{committed}} to western land speculation through its first experience of Indian {{war in the middle}} of the eighteenth century. My thesis tries to determine the elements which acted to combine the trade and this land speculation in the development of Pennsylvania Indian affairs. From the 1710 s through the 1730 s a flood of immigrants from Europe, particularly of Scotch Irish and Germans, rushed into Pennsylvania and propelled white settlers into unpurchased lands. Indian complaints about white encroachment into their hunting grounds increased, and the proprietary government adopted Iroquois suzerainty over all the other Indians, based on the New York-Iroquois Covenant Chain, in order to solve its immediate troubles over land titles with the local Indians. ^ This <b>delegated</b> Iroquois <b>sovereignty</b> ultimately served to spur western land speculation by inspiring designs of leading Pennsylvanians concerned in the Indian trade for a new interior colony. At the outbreak of Indian war, traders suffered great losses by the Indian attacks. Yet the speculators turned the traders 2 ̆ 7 losses to their own purposes in the projection of western land schemes. They demanded of the Iroquois chiefs extensive cession of land in compensation for losses caused by Iroquois tributary Indians. ^ Anglo-white invasion of Indian land expanded illegal settlement in the west which laid the groundwork for still more extensive land speculation. The Pennsylvania Indian trade played an active part in that expansion and prefigured the far wider white advance into the west which would be practiced after the Revolution by the new national government. ...|$|R
40|$|This work {{analyzes}} one of {{the strategies}} used by political elites in a Colombian city (Cali) during the mid-twentieth century {{in order to maintain}} and redefine their privileged place in society. It inquires about the conditions underlying the construction of a political vocabulary revolving around morality and virtue. Starting with the problematic definition of “the people” —as sovereign of democracy and <b>delegate</b> of <b>sovereignty</b> and political legitimacy—, we argue that the peculiarities of the Colombian political system can be better understood by using historiographical perspectives that recover the historicity of language. After reviewing local newspapers, municipal council archives and other printed sources, we recognized the configuration of a “moral language” through which local politicians legitimized their privileged position in regard to new social sectors and emerging political practices. The identity of “the people”, problematic subject and actor, was defined from an elaborated rhetoric fed by diverse daily life elements and configured through documentary records. Thus, moral references addressed by political ruling groups shaped a particular language that redefined the spaces occupied by other social groups. The identification and analysis of a specific political vocabulary in the 1940 s allows us, firstly, to reconsider the traditional periodization of twentieth century Colombian political history, and secondly, to question partisan divisions (liberal-conservative) as core elements in the analysis of cultural and political transformations in the mid-twentieth century —dominant topics in a traditional historiographical approach—. Finally, this study leads us to think about more universal problems that bring the political sphere closer to intellectual history...|$|R
6000|$|The {{character}} of the times aggravated these suspicions. [...] "In those days there was no king in Israel." [...] Since the departure of James VI. to assume the richer and more powerful crown of England, there had existed in Scotland contending parties, formed among the aristocracy, by whom, as their intrigues at the court of St. James's chanced to prevail, the <b>delegated</b> powers of <b>sovereignty</b> were alternately swayed. The evils attending upon this system of government resembled those which afflict the tenants of an Irish estate, the property of an absentee. There was no supreme power, claiming and possessing a general interest with the community at large, to whom the oppressed might appeal from subordinate tyranny, either for justice or for mercy. Let a monarch be as indolent, as selfish, as much disposed to arbitrary power as he will, still, in a free country, his own interests are so clearly connected {{with those of the}} public at large, and the evil consequences to his own authority are so obvious and imminent when a different course is pursued, that common policy, as well as common feeling, point to the equal distribution of justice, and to the establishment of the throne in righteousness. Thus, even sovereigns remarkable for usurpation and tyranny have been found rigorous in the administration of justice among their subjects, in cases where their own power and passions were not compromised.|$|R
40|$|Introduction]. With the Open Method of Coordination (OMC), the European Union {{added a new}} mode of {{governance}} to existing policy-making instruments. Instead of introducing joint competencies, the OMC consists of multilateral surveillance of national policies. Supporters of the OMC claim that it was developed to reconcile legitimacy with effectiveness since it {{takes into account the}} diversity of national welfare states while facilitating trans-border policy learning. In contrast, this paper seeks to show that EU member states mainly use soft law in response to substantive disagreements. This mirrors earlier developments of the OECD and the IMF, where multilateral surveillance was also introduced to resolve deadlocks. In each case, member states opted for a non-binding procedural solution to overcome competing visions of the organizations’ purposes. Hence international organizations select soft law less for its effectiveness than for its capacity to foster compromises. Based on case studies, this paper juxtaposes the inauguration of soft coordination in the OECD, the IMF and the EU during the 1960 s, 1970 s and 1990 s respectively. In all cases member states opted for soft law in times of ‘institutional crisis’ when more substantial agreements proved unattainable. As shown elsewhere, soft law policy coordination in the European Union shares many features with multilateral surveillance of the OECD and the IMF (Schäfer 2004). Hence we can obtain a broader view on why soft law was introduced to the EU by also looking at its origins in these organizations. A central argument of this paper is that existing approaches fail to convincingly explain the choice of soft law. They are much better at understanding harder forms of delegation and legal integration. Before we proceed, we have to clarify the notion of “soft law. ” In general, we use it if there are neither binding rules nor sanctions to enforce compliance. In terms of the concept of legalization (Abbott et al. 2000), soft law scores low both on obligation and delegation but sometimes can be quite precise. More specifically, we stick to the following definition of soft law: “Rules of conduct that are laid down in instruments which have not been attributed legally binding force as such, but nevertheless may have certain (indirect) legal effects, and that are aimed at and may produce practical effects”(Senden 2004 : 112, emphasis deleted). The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 looks at possible theoretical explanations for the choice of soft law. Recent contributions in the principal-agent framework are a good starting point to trace the question when governments decide to <b>delegate</b> or pool <b>sovereignty.</b> Since delegation always goes along with agency losses – principals cannot completely control agents – governments shy away from it if there is policy conflict. Based on this insight, section 3 offers a historical reconstruction of the introduction of soft law, in this case procedures of multilateral surveillance, in the OECD, the IMF, and the EU. Section four concludes...|$|R
