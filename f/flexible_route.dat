50|$|The term {{may have}} emerged into {{widespread}} industry discussion around 2015. Various definitions of microtransit have been attempted:IT-enabled private multi-passenger transportation services, such as Bridj, Chariot, Split, and Via, that serve passengers using dynamically generated routes, and may expect passengers {{to make their}} way to and from common pick-up or drop-off points. Vehicles can range from large SUVs to vans to shuttle buses. Because they provide transit-like service but on a smaller, more flexible scale, these new services have been referred to as microtransit. andAlternative transit services is a broad category that encompasses shuttles (shared vehicles that connect passengers to public transit or employment centers), paratransit, and private sector transit solutions commonly referred to as microtransit. Microtransit can include fixed route or <b>flexible</b> <b>route</b> services, as well as offer fixed schedules or on-demand service. In its most agile form (flexible routing, scheduling or both), microtransit and paratransit can be bundled under the category known as flexible transit services.|$|E

40|$|Background: A long {{distance}} to the bus stop, poor pedestrian accessibility and inadequate shelters are barriers to bus use for older people. <b>Flexible</b> <b>route</b> bus transport poses an opportunity to overcome these barriers. Purpose: The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate whether the replacement of a fixed route bus service with a <b>flexible</b> <b>route</b> bus service improves the use of, and satisfaction with, buses. The study emphasises the impact on older people. Methodology: One fixed route service in Hervey Bay, Queensland, Australia, was replaced with a <b>flexible</b> <b>route</b> service. Use of the bus service was monitored via ticket sale data over a nine month period. Pension concession ticket sales were used to estimate use by older people. Satisfaction surveys were conducted before and eight months following the introduction of the <b>flexible</b> <b>route</b> service. Results: Use by older people approximately doubled over an eight month period following introduction of the flexible service. In addition, there was a significant (p¼ 0. 002) increase in overall satisfaction with the bus service following the introduction of the <b>flexible</b> <b>route</b> service. Similar improvements were found for younger people. Conclusion: <b>Flexible</b> <b>route</b> bus transport is a promising technology to help meet the transport needs of older people. Further research should investigate the cost-benefit ratio of <b>flexible</b> <b>route</b> bus services, and trial <b>flexible</b> <b>route</b> buses in other geographical and socio-cultural contexts. <b>Flexible</b> <b>route</b> bus services are not only ‘‘age-friendly’’, but ‘‘people-friendly’’...|$|E

This article presents a multistage approach to solve flexible routing problem in flexible manufacturing systems. Multistage approach includes three stages; the first stage is a production simulation system to find the fitness of the flexible manufacturing systems corresponding to different products’ routes’ groups. The second stage proposes an artificial neural network approach to predict the products’ routes’ group in flexible manufacturing systems. The last stage combines genetic algorithms and artificial neural network to optimize proper routes for all product types in flexible manufacturing systems. Multistage approach proposed in this study aims to reduce the computational time required to obtain and optimize the <b>flexible</b> <b>routes</b> in <b>flexible</b> manufacturing systems. The results of this study show that the artificial neural network can be used efficiently to predict the <b>flexible</b> <b>routes</b> in <b>flexible</b> manufacturing systems and it reduces the computational time for routes’ optimization required with production simulation system.

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{and compares}} {{the effects of}} different objectives and financial constraints on conventional and <b>flexible</b> <b>route</b> bus systems, with special emphasis on the relation between subsidy and social welfare. Social welfare {{is the sum of}} producer surplus (profit) and consumer surplus and provides a good measure of overall net benefits. The optimization models are developed for conventional and <b>flexible</b> <b>route</b> bus systems, connecting a Central Business District (CBD) and a suburban area. Reflecting the current major financial policy concerns of bus transit systems, these models are designed to maximize: (1) operator profit or (2) social welfare with various financial constraints (i. e., break-even, given subsidy, and unconstrained subsidy). The values of the optimized decision variables (i. e., headway, bus route spacing, service area, and fare) are found for achieving those objectives. The most interesting results indicate that as subsidies increase, the social welfare increases much less than proportionally, for either type of bus service and for practically all circumstances considered. Sensitivity analyses are conducted for the effects of input parameters (i. e., potential demand densities, bus speeds, line-haul distances, and elasticity parameters) on optimized results (i. e. decision variables, objectives, and change ratio in optimized social welfare). These analyses provide useful guidelines for policy makers in determining efficient bus system designs and financial policies under various circumstances. (PDF failed to load in DRUM...|$|E
