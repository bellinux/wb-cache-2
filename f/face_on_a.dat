5|$|In 1903, Rhodes scored over 1,000 runs in {{the season}} for the first time, in the process {{completing}} his first double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets. However, after bowling {{a large number of}} overs against Worcestershire early in the season, he had little success as a bowler for a spell of three weeks. Pelham Warner, a leading amateur cricketer and later captain of England, noted that Rhodes was comparatively unsuccessful {{at the start of the}} year but came back well to take 193 wickets. Warner wrote that Rhodes at this time was accused of being easy to <b>face</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> wicket which suited the batsmen, although Warner himself did not agree.|$|E

5|$|Director Brad Bird {{wanted to}} open the episode with a close up of Krusty's face. The staff liked the idea and he then {{suggested}} that all three acts of the episode, defined by {{the placement of the}} commercial breaks, should begin with a close up shot. Act one begins with Krusty's face introducing the audience at his show, act two begins with Krusty's face being locked up behind bars, and act three begins with Sideshow Bob's <b>face</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> big poster. Krusty's character is based on a television clown from Portland, Oregon, called Rusty Nails, whom The Simpsons creator Matt Groening watched while growing up in Portland. The original teleplay, written by Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky, was 78 pages long and many scenes had to be cut. One scene that had to be cut down was the scene where Patty and Selma show the slideshow of their vacation; it originally contained images of them being detained for bringing heroin into America.|$|E

The latter had many matches {{taking place in the}} original Boston Garden. On March 3, 1988, nearly a year after their initial encounter Roma & Powers again faced Demolition (Ax now with Barry Darsow as Smash) on Prime Time Wrestling.

25|$|Although CP/M {{provided}} some hardware abstraction to standardize the interface to disk I/O or console I/O, typically application programs still required installation {{to make use}} of all the features of such equipment as printers and terminals. Often these were controlled by escape sequences which had to be altered for different devices. For example, the escape sequence to select bold <b>face</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> printer would have differed among manufacturers, and sometimes among models within a manufacturer's range. This procedure was not defined by the operating system; a user would typically run an installation program that would either allow selection from a range of devices, or else allow feature-by-feature editing of the escape sequences required to access a function. This had to be repeated for each application program, since there was no central operating system service provided for these devices.|$|E
25|$|Scott {{returned}} to Britain in October 1951 to film Stolen Face (1952), a noir that presages Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958) by several years. It combined elements from medical science-fiction (repeated {{in the later}} work of the director, Terence Fisher, in his cycle of Hammer horror films). Paul Henreid is Dr. Philip Ritter, a London plastic surgeon, who upon losing the love of an American concert pianist, Alice Brent (Scott), recreates her <b>face</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> disfigured female criminal. Hal Wallis and Scott, by allowing Henreid to be the leading man, {{were among the first}} to break the Hollywood blacklist. As a former member of the Committee for the First Amendment, Henreid was forced to seek work in Europe. Scott later starred in an anti-McCarthy noir, raising the ire of a pro-McCarthy journalist, who linked Scott's future visit to Cannes, France], with an alleged visit to a Parisian nightclub.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Sultaana Freeman (formerly Sandra Keller, who {{converted}} to Islam in 1997 when marrying a Muslim man), sued the U.S. state of Florida {{for the right}} to wear a niqab for her driver's license photo. However, a Florida appellate court ruled that there was no violation in the state requiring her to show her face to a camera in a private room with only a female employee to take the picture, in exchange for the privilege of driving. The prevailing view in Florida is currently that hiding one's <b>face</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> form of photo identification defeats the purpose of having the picture taken, although 15 other states (including Arkansas, California, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, and Louisiana) have provisions that allow for driver's licenses absent of an identifying photograph in order to accommodate individuals who may have a religious reason to not have a photograph taken. In 2012, a string of armed robberies in Philadelphia were committed by people disguised in traditional Islamic woman's garb; Muslim leaders were concerned that the use of the disguises could put Muslim women in danger of hate crimes and inflame ethnic tensions.|$|E
