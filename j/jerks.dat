5|$|It is Christmas in Bikini Bottom and Plankton is {{miserable and}} angry for {{committing}} so many naughty deeds, {{that he always}} gets on Santa's naughty list, making him unable to receive his Christmas wishthe Krusty Krab's Krabby Patty secret formula. However, he discovers Jerktonium, a dangerous chemical element {{which serves as a}} trap for the citizens of Bikini Bottom and is capable of turning anyone into a jerk. He cooks it into fruitcakes that he intends to feed to all the Bikini Bottomites and turn them into <b>jerks.</b> In order to test it, Plankton gives SpongeBob a slice, but nothing seems to work on SpongeBob, who is immune to Jerktonium because of the combination of his small brain and his very big heart. Increasingly infuriated that his plan has seemingly failed completely to suffice, Plankton gives his fruitcake dispenser to SpongeBob, who promptly distributes the fruitcakes to all of Bikini Bottom and transforms all the residents into <b>jerks.</b> After realizing that the element works only on other people in Bikini Bottom instead and that SpongeBob is so full of Christmas spirit that he is immune to jerktonium, Plankton is forced to send out an evil wind-up robot version of SpongeBob to commit troublesome deeds to frame the real SpongeBob.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1977 in {{downtown}} New York, punk rock was already ceding its cutting-edge status to the anarchic sound of Teenage Jesus and the <b>Jerks</b> and Mars, spearheads of {{what became known}} as no wave, although several original punk bands continued to perform and new ones emerged on the scene. The Cramps, whose core members were from Sacramento, California by way of Akron, had debuted at CBGB in November 1976, opening for the Dead Boys. They were soon playing regularly at Max's Kansas City. The Misfits formed in nearby New Jersey. Still developing what would become their signature B movieâ€“inspired style, later dubbed horror punk, they made their first appearance at CBGB in April 1977.|$|E
5|$|The {{genesis of}} Radioland Murders came from {{executive}} producer/co-writer George Lucas's obsession with old-time radio. Lucas conceived the storyline {{of the film}} during the writing phase of American Graffiti, viewing it as a homage to the various Abbott and Costello films, primarily Who Done It (1942), in which Abbott and Costello star as two soda <b>jerks</b> solving a murder in a radio station. Radioland Murders also shares some inspiration from The Big Clock (1948). When Universal Pictures accepted American Graffiti in 1972, Lucas also allowed the studio first look deals for both Radioland Murders and an untitled science fiction film (which eventually {{became the basis for}} Star Wars).|$|E
5|$|Logona Esau {{qualified}} for weightlifting via {{an invitation from}} the Tripartite commission. He represented Tuvalu as its first weightlifter, and its only competitor in the sport at the Beijing Games. He competed in the lightweight class. Born in the South Pacific island nation of Nauru in 1987, Esau was 21 {{years old at the}} time of his participation in his Beijing event. He was the most experienced and decorated of the three Tuvaluan athletes who came to Beijing's Olympic Games, having previously medaled in Oceanian international competitions. Logona Esau's event, which took place on August 12, included 30 athletes. He and New Zealand's Mark Spooner were the only competitors from Oceania in that particular competition. All of Esau's snatches were successful, and he lifted 102kilograms, 107kilograms, and 110kilograms successively. During the clean and <b>jerks,</b> Esau successfully lifted 138kilograms, then 144kilograms. He unsuccessfully attempted to lift 148kilograms. His total score, a combination of his highest snatch and clean and jerk lifts, was 254kilograms. This ranked the Tuvaluan in 23rd place out of the 24 athletes who finished the event. Tajikistan scored below Tuvalu at 250kilograms and Nepal scored immediately above at 268kilograms. In comparison, Liao Hui of China won the gold medal after lifting a combined 348kilograms.|$|E

5|$|Manuel Minginfel was {{the only}} {{weightlifter}} at the Beijing Olympics who competed {{under the banner of}} the Federated States of Micronesia. He participated in the men's featherweight class, which includes athletes of 62kilograms and below. Born in Yap, Minginfel was 21 years old when he first competed at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Although he was unable to successfully lift any snatches at those games, Minginfel finished in his event when at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, at 25 years old. The Micronesian athlete was 29 years old {{when he returned to the}} Olympics for the third time in 2008. During the course of his event, which took place on August 11, Minginfel {{was the only}} Oceanian competing against 16 other athletes. While on the snatch phase, Minginfel successfully lifted 115kilograms on his first attempt and 120kilograms on his second attempt, but failed to lift 123kilograms on his third try. However, he succeeded in all of his clean and <b>jerks,</b> and successfully lifted 145kilograms; 150kilograms; then 155kilograms. His final score, which combines his highest lifted weight from the snatch and clean and jerk categories, was 275kilograms. Of the 12 athletes who finished the event, Minginfel ranked 11th ahead of Canadian weightlifter Jasvir Singh (266kilograms) and behind Henadzy Makhveyenia of Belarus (278kilograms). In comparison, gold medalist Zhang Xiangxiang of China lifted a combined total of 319kilograms.|$|E
5|$|Bathymetry is {{the mapping}} and {{study of the}} {{topography}} of the ocean floor. Methods used for measuring {{the depth of the}} sea include single or multibeam echosounders, laser airborne depth sounders and the calculation of depths from satellite remote sensing data. This information is used for determining the routes of undersea cables and pipelines, for choosing suitable locations for siting oil rigs and offshore wind turbines and for identifying possible new fisheries. The Earth is composed of a magnetic central core, a mostly liquid mantle, and a hard rigid outer shell (or lithosphere), which is composed of the Earth's rocky crust and the deeper and mostly solid outer layer of the mantle. The crust below land is known as continental while that under the abyssal sea is called oceanic. The latter is composed of relatively dense basalt and is some five to ten kilometers (three to six miles) thick. The relatively thin lithosphere floats on the weaker and hotter mantle below and is fractured into a number of tectonic plates. In mid-ocean, magma is constantly being thrust through the seabed between adjoining plates to form mid-oceanic ridges and here convection currents within the mantle tend to drive the two plates apart. Parallel to these ridges and nearer the coasts, one oceanic plate may slide beneath another oceanic plate in a process known as subduction. Deep trenches are formed here and the process is accompanied by friction as the plates grind together. The movement proceeds in <b>jerks</b> which cause earthquakes. Heat is also produced and magma is forced up, creating underwater mountains, some of which grow into volcanic islands. Near some boundaries between the land and sea, the slightly denser oceanic plates slide beneath the continental plates and more subduction trenches are formed. As they grate together, the continental plates are deformed and buckle causing mountain building and seismic activity.|$|E

40|$|This paper announces an eight-term novel 3 -D <b>jerk</b> {{chaotic system}} with three {{quadratic}} nonlinearities. The phase {{portraits of the}} novel <b>jerk</b> chaotic system are displayed and the qualitative properties of the <b>jerk</b> system are described. The novel <b>jerk</b> chaotic system has two equilibrium points, which are saddle-foci and unstable. The Lyapunov exponents of the novel <b>jerk</b> chaotic system are obtained as L 1 = 0. 20572,L 2 = 0 and L 3 = âˆ’ 1. 20824. Since {{the sum of the}} Lyapunov exponents of the <b>jerk</b> chaotic system is negative, we conclude that the chaotic system is dissipative. The Kaplan-Yorke dimension of the novel <b>jerk</b> chaotic system is derived as DKY = 2. 17026. Next, an adaptive controller is designed via backstepping control method to globally stabilize the novel <b>jerk</b> chaotic system with unknown parameters. Moreover, an adaptive controller is also designed via backstepping control method to achieve global chaos synchronization of the identical <b>jerk</b> chaotic systems with unknown parameters.

40|$|<b>Jerk</b> is {{the time}} rate of {{acceleration}} and mainly represents the nonstationary component in high frequency band of the earthquake wave. The study on <b>jerk</b> and its response spectra can enhance {{the recognition of the}} nonstationary ground motion. The mechanical meaning and research value of <b>jerk</b> are described. <b>Jerk</b> is recommended to be solved by establishing state-space equations and Runge-Kutta method. The solution method of elastic and inelastic <b>jerk</b> response spectra under ground motion is established, and the accurate <b>jerk</b> spectrum should be calculated directly according to numerical computing instead of pseudo-acceleration spectrum. The characteristics of <b>jerk</b> response spectra are studied according to the influencing factors, such as site condition, amplification factor, ductility factor, and reduction factor. The concept of impact reduction factor is presented. The statistical results show that the <b>jerk</b> spectrum has similar rules as the acceleration spectrum, and the amplitude is relative to the predominant period, especially for structures with short or medium period. If the ductility is improved, the effective <b>jerk</b> will reduce obviously, and the impact reduction factor will be enhanced. Different from the strength reduction factor, the impact reduction factor is nearly not relevant to the period...|$|R

40|$|Many {{older people}} have {{impaired}} dynamic stability, {{and up to}} one in three people over 65 fall each year. It is thought that older people walk more slowly to compensate for reduced capabilities. Here, we investigate whether head <b>jerk,</b> the first time derivative of acceleration, can further our understanding of age-associated changes in dynamic stability while walking. Gait parameters including cadence, step length, walking speed, harmonic ratios, step time variability, and <b>jerk</b> were measured in 43 young and 100 older people using accelerometers securely attached to the head and pelvis. Older people presented significantly (p â‰¤ 0. 004) more mediolateral (ML) head <b>jerk,</b> but significantly less vertical (VT) head <b>jerk.</b> The dimensionless ratio, ML/VT <b>jerk,</b> demonstrated superior ability (89 % accuracy) in differentiating older from younger people. Principal component analysis indicated that ML/VT <b>jerk</b> was a distinct gait construct. ML/VT <b>jerk</b> was highly reliable, normally distributed, independent of stature or gender, and relatively unaffected by walking speed. In older people, reduced VT head <b>jerk</b> may indicate reduced gait vigour, and increased ML head <b>jerk</b> may indicate age-associated changes to dynamic stability. The smoother head movements evident in our younger group may be because they were more able to rely on automatic control and the dynamic (pendulum-like) stability of their systems.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new seven-term 3 -D <b>jerk</b> chaotic system with two cubic nonlinearities.

40|$|Patients {{with chronic}} lower back pain (CLBP) {{typically}} demonstrate different biomechanics than healthy controls during a lifting task. Motion differences in a repetitive lifting task {{have been described}} previously using differences in the timing of body angles changes during the lift. These timing changes rely on small differences of motion and are difficult to measure and to interpret. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate shoulder <b>jerk</b> (rate of change of acceleration) in a repetitive lifting task as a parameter to detect differences of motion between controls and CLBP patients and to measure the impact of a rehabilitation program on <b>jerk.</b> The <b>jerk</b> calculation proved to be a noisy measure since <b>jerk</b> is the third derivative of position, and a simulation study was performed to evaluate smoothing methods to provide the best estimates of the third derivative. Woltring's generalized cross-validation spline produced the best estimates and was fit to subject data. Derivatives were calculated using differentiation of the spline coefficients, and root-means-square (rms) amplitude of <b>jerk</b> was used for comparison. Lifts were divided into phases of early, middle or late based on the number of repetitions completed by the subject. Average values of rms <b>jerk</b> during a lift were computed at each of the task phases. Significant group differences were found for rms <b>jerk.</b> CLBP patients were found to perform lifts with lower <b>jerk</b> values than controls and as the task progressed, rms <b>jerk</b> increased for both groups.
