40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the renovation of}} Grenoble University's library. It is the main <b>inter-university</b> documentary <b>cooperation</b> service (SICD 2) network in Grenoble, which serves two Universities: Stendhal and Pierre Mendès France. Administratively it {{is attached to the}} latter. After the 1989 Micquel Report, which was a severe appraisal of France's university libraries, the state showed its intention to upgrade them by preparing the U 2000 programme. The objectives were to create more working places, unrestricted access to documentation, improve user comfort, and change the image of the libraries. In June 1994, replying to representations by the President of Grenoble's Université Pierre Mendès-France (UPMF) on safety problems at the Law and Humanities Library, the Construction and Maintenance Department at the Ministry of Education requested an "all-encompassing approach to upgrading work, covering safety and refurbishment to as-new standard", and stipulated that "this policy review should be conducted as part of the preparation of the new establishment contract". This context gave rise to the rehabilitation and restructuring of the library. In 1995, the universities and the SICD set themselves an ambition: to turn the 1960 s library into a documentary resource for the 21 st century, making it the lynchpin of the SICD library network and providing suitable premises. The project symbolically called "Doc 2000 " was created. After a long gestation period, during which funding was gradually secured, the project entered the execution phase. The relevance of the project was tested by numerous twists and turns: a fruitless invitation to tender and shifting project ownership; three university presidents; two SICD directors and one interim-director, who also directed the university library; and the involvement of two project leaders. I intend to show how hard it is for the library, {{at the end of the}} process chain, to reconcile and align the scheduling of the works, the scheduling of the service changes and structural organisation, and the works themselves. I'll outline the basic economics of the project, which combines an obsolete building with thoughts on the necessary evolution of its services. Then, I'll attempt to show how we tried to develop the existing building to cater for evolving services. Lastly, I'll explain why execution of the works was like sailing down a long tempestuous river...|$|R

40|$|This article {{describes}} the design, execution and outcomes of a Web-based course in cable telecommunications offered jointly at two U. S. universities. The goal was to create an online learning community where inter-university student teams collaborate electronically to learn through case-based problem solving. The main features were distributed team-centered learning, case method, online access to industry experts, a variety of synchronous and asynchronous IT and communication tools and electronic team teaching. Outcomes indicate positive learning differences. Satisfaction, higher overall, was lower than expected with experts and teammates at the distant university. Compared to the classroom model, students acquired greater experience in areas other than knowledge of course content: teamwork, communication, time management and technology use. Evidence emerged that satisfaction and learning outcomes may be more related to a student’s positive outlook than to factors such as grade point average, prior experience with teams or with technology.

Acidic pH (2. 0 - 5. 0) and bile salt concentrations of 0. 3 % {{were used as}} stress conditions. The adhesive properties were assessed by determination of bacterial hydrophobicity. The strain MMRA showed interesting features such as high tolerance to gastrointestinal tract transit, an extremely high survival rates under stress caused by acidic pHs or bile salts, and a high adhesive potential linked to the elevated percentage of hydrophobicity. Furthermore, the genome of this strain was examined for the occurrence of known enterocin (enterococcal bacteriocins) genes by means of specific PCR assays and this study revealed the genes coding for enterocins A, B, P and X. Although the joint production of these bacteriocins has not been verified, producers of multiple enterocins could have a great technological potential as protective and/or probiotic cultures in the food industry.

40|$|The {{choice to}} once again {{dedicate}} some time {{to the theme of}} E-Learning as a possible strategic aspect in <b>inter-university</b> <b>cooperation</b> has root in the consideration of a nature generally relative to the theme of relations between North and South. It concerns the importance of the fact, “knowledge”, as precondition of every project of development that could be supported and maintained. Acknowledging the fact of knowledge is strategic in every action of development. It means that every action of development must be concerned with “teaching to do”. In this sense the strength of forms of transmission of knowledge must be taken advantage of, from more informal levels to auto or self-learning up to those levels that are more institutional and related to university education. It is typically the elevated level- the university education- that has been the object of reflection in the Panel under consideration. Through the four expositions, quite different in approaches and in the speakers ’ backgrounds, questions are raised on the actuality and the possibility that the development of the African continent could consider.

40|$|Introduction When the Institute of Social Studies, ISS, {{was founded}} in 1952 in The Hague as a {{postgraduate}} centre for teaching and research on social and economic development, it established the first Masters programme in public administration and the first professorial chair in that area in the Netherlands. Since the late 1970 s the programme’s emphasis has been on public policy and public sector reform rather than on traditional public administration, for which there are sufficient programmes in the South. From {{the same time the}} ISS and especially the public policy programme has had Southern Africa as one of its main work areas, notably including <b>inter-university</b> <b>cooperation</b> projects in Zimbabwe, South Africa and Namibia. These two orientations [...] education in public policy and public management, and special reference to Southern Africa [...] are combined in the set of four articles that follow. Four ISS faculty members, three of whom have worked extensively in Southern Africa since the 1970 s, present ideas about the teaching of public policy. Vasant Moharir provides an overview of the evolution of policy studies education and training, drawing on a career of over forty years as academic and adviser in numerous countries in Asia, Africa, North America and Europe, including South Africa in the 1990 s. He raises some questions of special importance for Africa, and stresses the value, yet shortage, of national and international fora for exchange and discussion of experiences in teaching public policy. He also argues for the special potential importance of short-term courses in policy analysis for senior and middle level officials and politicians, if national training institutions can attain and maintain the stature and competence of a body like INTAN in Malaysia. In South Africa there appears good progress with some of these elements if not yet all. Jim Björkman looks at changes in the world since public policy was conceptualized as a field of research fifty years ago and operationalized as a field of study thirty years back: greater mistrust of governments (though South Africa is perhaps presently an exception); the growth of multi-jurisdiction and cross-sector programmes; the hegemony now of liberal economics and liberal democracy, at risk of ignoring their limitations and contradictions; the information revolution; and the failure to arrive at a grand unifying theory for policy studies. He draws implications in each case for public policy education. He then synthesizes these into a broad sketch of elements of a desirable curriculum, including sets of necessary skills and values as well as relevant areas of knowledge. Marc Wuyts and Des Gasper provide complementary papers, on attainable skills and tools that can be offered to students of public policy and development management to help them deal intelligently with the texts and data-sets they encounter. Wuyts takes quantitative analysis and Gasper qualitative. Wuyts considers how to descriptively summarize data in order to generate hypotheses, as a prelude to trying to test them; Gasper considers how to descriptively summarize arguments, as a prelude to assessing them. Wuyts presents quantitative data analysis as centrally involving the generation of questions and hypotheses, not merely the testing of already given hypotheses. The creation of conjectures is promoted by intelligent description of the data, in dialogue with theory. Description and summarization involve choices and always imply ideas about the material. We describe more intelligently by becoming more conscious of our assumptions and consequent choices. Wuyts shows how to tackle data so as to raise questions and examine assumptions, with a case from Botswana statistics on population distribution. Gasper looks at tools of argument analysis, with extended examples of their use on policy-related texts from Zimbabwe and South Africa. He presents three workable, complementary methods: a tabular format for examining the components of an argument and their meanings; second, attention to the use of terms that convey praise or criticism and hence hint at conclusions but also, as one becomes conscious of the linguistic choices made, point towards possible counter-arguments; and thirdly, another tabular format, for describing an argument’s logical structure and the possible rebuttals. Both Wuyts and Gasper seek to combine systematic use of methods with close attention to the meanings of data, whether quantitative or qualitative, so that methods will be one’s tools and not one’s master. Together with Björkman they give advice on how to teach methods of analysis so as to fit them into systematic argumentation about development situations and policy options, rather than let methods dominate and thus hinder purposeful and independent thinking. This is the approach that ISS aims to practice and share. DES GASPER Edito...|$|E
