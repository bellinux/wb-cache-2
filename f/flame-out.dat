50|$|Despite all the preparations, major {{problems}} with the Lyul'ka engine caused several <b>flame-outs,</b> one of which caused serious damage during the ensuing deadstick landing.|$|R
5|$|The new He 162 {{had about}} 30 minutes worth of fuel. This {{endurance}} {{was simply not}} enough, {{and at least two}} JG 1 pilots were killed making Deadstick landing after exhausting their fuel. By April, I./JG 1 had scored a number of kills, but at the cost of 13 He 162s and 10 pilots. The losses were mostly attributed to issues with the He 162 such as engine <b>flame-outs</b> or occasional structural failures, which can most probably be attributed to poor design and insufficient development time. On 24 April 1945, III./JG 1 was disbanded.|$|R
25|$|Flight 348 was {{carrying}} eight crew, 116 passengers and 10 off-duty employees of Kogalymavia. As the aircraft was taxiing for take-off from Surgut International Airport, a fire developed {{in one of}} the engines and an emergency evacuation was ordered. It was initially reported that the aircraft had made an emergency landing following an engine <b>flame-out</b> on take-off. The accident occurred at 13:12 local time (08:12 UTC). Three people were killed, and 43 people were injured, from smoke inhalation or burns. The aircraft was operating a domestic scheduled flight from Surgut to Moscow. The aircraft was burnt out by the fire, which was extinguished by 13:45 local time. Members of the 1990s Russian pop group NaNa were on board the plane at the time. A statement by the Russia's Ministry of Health and Social Development gave figures of 117 passengers and 18 crew.|$|E
500|$|The SATCOM link functioned {{normally}} from pre-flight (beginning at 00:00 MYT) {{until it}} {{responded to a}} ground-to-air ACARS message with an acknowledge message at 01:07. Ground-to-air ACARS messages continued to be transmitted to Flight 370 until Inmarsat's network sent multiple [...] "Request for Acknowledge" [...] messages at 02:03, without a response from the aircraft. At some time between 01:07 and 02:03, power was lost to the SDU. At 02:25, the aircraft's SDU sent a [...] "log-on request". It is not common for a log-on request to be made in-flight, but it could occur for multiple reasons. An analysis of the characteristics and timing of these requests suggest a power interruption in-flight {{is the most likely}} culprit. As the power interruption was not due to engine <b>flame-out,</b> per ATSB, {{it may have been the}} result of manually switching off the aircraft's electrical system.|$|E
500|$|Since the {{aircraft}} {{did not respond}} to a ping at 09:15, it can be concluded that at some point between 08:19 and 09:15, {{the aircraft}} lost the ability to communicate with the ground station.

50|$|On 29 November 2013, {{a police}} {{helicopter}} {{crashed into the}} Clutha Vaults, a pub on the north bank of the River Clyde in central Glasgow. The aircraft was operated by Bond Air Services for Police Scotland and was being crewed by a civilian pilot and two police officers. The cause of the crash was a double engine <b>flame-out</b> due to pilot error.|$|E
50|$|In the {{gas turbine}} engine business, engine {{operability}} {{is the ability of}} the engine to operate without compressor stall or surge, combustor <b>flame-out</b> or other power loss. Operability engineers work in the fields of engine and compressor modeling, control and test to ensure the engine meets its ignition, starting, acceleration, deceleration and over-speed requirements under the most extreme operating conditions.|$|E
50|$|The {{direct cause}} of the crash was {{determined}} as flight into extreme weather causing the engines to <b>flame-out</b> and failure to maintain control during the recovery. Contributory causes were the failure of air traffic services to warn of the extreme weather and {{the inability of the}} aircraft's weather radar to penetrate even moderate precipitation, leaving the crew unaware of the extreme precipitation in the weather ahead.|$|E
5000|$|The film {{received}} mixed reviews. [...] "Torontoist" [...] {{deemed it}} the [...] "most recognizably Canadian comedy ever". [...] Greg Quill of the Toronto Star panned the production as [...] "a fiasco, a <b>flame-out</b> for sure, but an epic failure."

50|$|However, on 27 May, {{the first}} {{fatalities}} were suffered when a MiG-21 {{was shot down}} by Pakistan Army over Batalik sector, while a MiG-27 crashed due to engine <b>flame-out.</b> The following day, a Mi-17 was lost- {{with the loss of}} all four of the crew- when it was hit by three Stinger missiles while on an offensive sortie. These losses forced the Indian Air Force to reassess its strategy. The helicopters were immediately withdrawn from offensive roles as a measure against the man-portable missiles in possession of the infiltrators.|$|E
50|$|Group Captain Kambampati Nachiketa Vayusena Medal (Gallantry), is {{a serving}} {{officer of the}} Indian Air Force. Group Captain Nachiketa came into the limelight during the Kargil War when on 27 May 1999, as a Flight Lieutenant, he was {{captured}} by Pakistani troops in Kashmir following ejection from his MiG-27L aircraft after his engine was hit by Pakistani Stinger missile causing an engine <b>flame-out</b> while flying against infiltrator positions during {{the initial stages of}} Operation Safed Sagar.

50|$|It {{was used}} in the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-350, but flamed out when it was {{throttled}} back on that aircraft's first flight on 16 June 1951. It was also flown in the Lavochkin La-190 in 1951, but suffered similar problems. The AL-5 was modified as the AL-5G in an attempt to rectify the <b>flame-out</b> problem, which also increased its thrust by 2 kN, and was successfully flown in the prototype Ilyushin Il-46 bomber during 1952, but was not placed into production when the Tupolev Tu-16 was ordered into production instead of the Il-46.|$|E
50|$|While {{flying at}} 33,000 ft, the aircraft's speed {{gradually}} decreased until it entered an aerodynamic stall. The crew, probably under the mistaken {{belief that the}} aircraft had suffered a double engine <b>flame-out,</b> {{did not take the}} necessary actions to recover from the stall. After a 7,000 feet per minute dive with engines in a flight idle or near flight idle condition, the plane crashed and burst into flames at 07:01 UTC into a field on a cattle ranch near Machiques, in the western Zulia State, Venezuela (about 30 kilometres from the Colombian border).|$|E
5000|$|On May 24, 1988, a Boeing 737-300 {{operating}} as TACA Flight 110 to New Orleans suffered a double engine <b>flame-out</b> due to water ingestion, {{a result of}} an in-flight encounter with an area of very heavy rain and hail. The design of the engines and FAA water ingestion certification standards did {{not take into account the}} higher water volume of strong or severe thunderstorms while operating at lower power. The plane landed without further damage on a grass levee at the NASA Michoud Assembly Facility. All 45 passengers were uninjured.|$|E
50|$|If a {{jet plane}} is flying through air {{contaminated}} with volcanic ash, there is risk that ingested ash will cause erosion {{damage to the}} compressor blades, blockage of fuel nozzle air holes and blockage of the turbine cooling passages. Some of these effects may cause the engine to surge or <b>flame-out</b> during the flight. Re-lights are usually successful after flame-outs but with considerable loss of altitude. It {{was the case of}} British Airways Flight 9 which flew through volcanic dust at 37,000 ft. All 4 engines flamed out and re-light attempts were successful at about 13,000 ft.|$|E
5000|$|Above {{the clouds}} and the storm, Dr. Bussey had been facing his own {{challenges}} with the weather. [...] "Immediately after a launch the most critical {{was to keep the}} balloon climbing, slowly climbing," [...] Bussey explained later. [...] "At that point the balloon is at maximum gross weight and any type of descent could possibly go into an uncontrolled descent. So I’m watching the flame, being certain I don’t have a <b>flame-out.</b> I want the balloon climbing at all times at a reasonable rate (200 fpm) not a fast rate, but a reasonable rate because with all that fuel on board I’m flying a bomb." ...|$|E
50|$|Whilst {{en-route}} but nearing {{its destination}} the aircraft experienced severe turbulence and was cleared to successively lower altitudes {{in an attempt}} to avoid the turbulence. During the descent the aircraft entered a region of severe precipitation, which caused both engines to <b>flame-out</b> due to very high levels of water ingestion. The crew managed to re-light both engines but lost control and impacted the ground. The aircraft struck the ground in a slightly nose down and right wing low attitude, bounced and then struck the ground a second time, sliding along the ground coming to a rest inverted. Both crew and eleven of the passengers were killed in the accident.|$|E
5000|$|He {{was killed}} in a falcon plane crash near Urmia. According to the Aviation Safety Network, the plane [...] "Crash-landed in a field in poor weather conditions. ... Reports {{indicate}} that the crew did not get three greens after selecting the gear down while on approach to Orumiyeh Airport. A flypast was done so the control tower could observe the status of the landing gear. While circling the airplane suffered a double engine <b>flame-out,</b> reportedly as a result of engine icing. An emergency landing was attempted in a field, but the Falcon crashed". Reports that the plane crashed due to sabotage or a bomb are still not proved. His funeral was held in Tehran and Iranian Leader Ali Khamenei attended as well.|$|E

50|$|Seven {{months later}} in June 1944, having {{recovered}} from his injuries and commissioned as an officer, Ltn Schnörrer {{was transferred to}} Erprobungskommando 262, a small unit doing flight-testing of the revolutionary new Messerschmitt Me 262 jet. In September, the fighter was ready to proceed to advanced combat-testing and his friend Walter Nowotny {{was brought in to}} lead the project. On 26 September, the unit was re-designated Kommando Nowotny. But progress was slow and with the war-situation getting worse, an impatient General Galland arrived in early-November to get a personal report. On 8 November, in very poor weather conditions, Nowotny led a schwarm of Me 262s into one of its first group combat missions. Tragically, although he shot down a bomber and a Mustang fighter he was himself killed, probably picked off after yet another engine <b>flame-out</b> left him defenceless.|$|E

50|$|Once an {{aircraft}} has lined up, the pilots increase the engine power. The level reached is 40-60% RPM of low pressure turbine on Boeings, and 50% on Airbuses. This {{is done to}} prevent <b>flame-out</b> on takeoff due to compressor stall. The pilots then press the TO/GA switch, by pushing the thrust levers to TO/GA on Boeings or to TO/GA or FLEX detent on Airbuses, and the engines then increase to their computed take off power. Modern aircraft flight management computers will determine the power needed by the engines to take off, based {{on a number of}} factors such as runway length, wind speed, temperature, and most importantly the weight of the aircraft. In older aircraft these calculations were performed by the pilots before a takeoff. The advantage of having such a system is the ability to reduce wear and tear on the engines by only using as much power as is actually required to ensure the aircraft reaches a safe take off speed.|$|E
5000|$|Bluebird {{may have}} {{exceeded}} its aerodynamic static stability limit, {{complicated by the}} additional destabilising influences of loss of engine thrust. There is also evidence {{to point to the}} fact that K7's dynamic stability limit had been exceeded. The cause(s) of the engine <b>flame-out</b> cannot be established unequivocally. It could have been due to fuel starvation, damage to some ancillary structural element associated with engine function (following the worst bouncing episode), disturbance of the airstream into the intakes during the pitching episodes, or indeed a combination of all three. Further evidence of lost engine thrust may be seen in both cinematographic and still film recordings of {{the latter part of the}} run - as Bluebird left the water, jet exhaust from a functioning engine would have severely disturbed the water surface; no such disturbance or accompanying spray is evident. Also, close examination of such records show no evidence to the effect that the water brake was deployed.|$|E
50|$|After the 1965 Indo-Pak War the {{squadron}} conducted several more sorties deep into Indian territory. Soon after war in October 1965, Squadron Leader Rashid Mir flew an RB-57B over Agra, while being monitored by another B-57 {{from a large}} distance. The Indian Air Force attempted to engage Sqn Ldr Mir's aircraft over Agra with SA-2 Guideline surface-to-air missile but the missile exploded on launch. Another {{attempt was made to}} intercept Sqn Ldr Mir by Indian MiG-21s over the area of Pathankot/Amritsar. The aircraft was again attacked by an SA-2 Guideline missile over Ambala and this time the shockwave of the missile's warhead was reported by Sqn Ldr Mir to have buffeted the aircraft, caused an engine to <b>flame-out</b> and shattered the windshield with a fragment of debris. The aircraft began losing height and Indian MiG-21s again attempted to intercept, but Sqn Ldr Mir managed to reach Pakistani airspace and the Indian interceptors stopped pursuing him on detection of PAF F-104 Starfighters. The damaged aircraft was landed by Mir, though severely damaged.|$|E

5000|$|One {{objection}} raised against {{flight envelope}} protection is {{the incident that}} happened to China Airlines Flight 006, a Boeing 747SP-09, northwest of San Francisco in 1985. In this flight incident, the crew was forced to overstress (and structurally damage) the horizontal tail surfaces in order to recover from a roll and near-vertical dive. (This had been caused by an automatic disconnect of the autopilot and incorrect handling of a yaw brought about by an engine <b>flame-out).</b> The pilot recovered control with about 10,000 ft of altitude remaining (from its original high-altitude cruise). But to do that the pilot had to pull the aircraft with an estimated 5.5 G, or more than twice its design limits. If the aircraft had a flight envelope protection system, this recovery {{could not have been}} performed. Against this objection, Airbus has responded that an A320 in the situation of Flight 006 [...] "never would have fallen out of the airin the first place: the envelope protection would have automatically kept it in level flight in spite of the drag of a stalled engine".|$|E
