For the ringed plover, for example, Sven Nilsson speaks for Sweden and the Baltic coast; Mr Hewitson for Norway; Carl Linnaeus for Lapland; a Mr Scoresby for Iceland and Greenland; the zoologist Thomas Pennant for Russia and Siberia; the archaeologist Charles Fellows for Asia Minor , and Coenraad Jacob Temminck for Japan. In {{the case of the}} wood sandpiper, Dr. Calvert sent a specimen from Malta; Selby and Dr. Andrew Smith, specimens from South Africa; others from India; Gould [...] "mentions having seen skins" [...] from [...] "Chili and the Islands of the Pacific". Yarrell also describes his own observations, in this case with the words [...] "It [...] is far from being numerous in the localities where I met with it... Although <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> young in a downy state, and partially feathered, I only obtained one nest with eggs." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{announcing his}} {{resignation}} from the Bush Administration, Rove appeared on Fox News Sunday and Meet the Press, and discussed {{his role in}} the Plame affair. According to Rove, he didn't believe he was a confirming source for Robert Novak and Matt Cooper with regard to Plame. Rove also reiterated that he first learned of Plame from another reporter, though would not disclose which reporter. Rove told Gregory [...] "I acted in an appropriate manner, made all the appropriate individuals aware of my contact. <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> FBI right at the beginning of this, told them everything. You're right, the special prosecutor declined to take any action at all. I was never a target." [...] Rove told Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday [...] "I didn't know her name, didn't know her status at the CIA." ...|$|E
2500|$|Evangelical {{organisation}} Andrew Wommack Ministries declared {{support for}} the bill. [...] "I knew this information was wrong and the punishments were vastly exaggerated as is so often the case. <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> member of parliament responsible for this bill {{and he gave me}} his reasoning for introducing this legislation. Uganda had just had the United Nations try to pressure them into passing pro-homosexual legislation in order to obtain a large sum of money offered to them (a bribe). They responded with this legislation in order to stop the strong arm tactics of the pro-homosexual western influence. Would to God American leaders had enough integrity to not be bribed or badgered into compliance. Although I knew the situation was being misrepresented, I didn't feel qualified to deal with this personally. But Leland Shores who runs our office in Kampala, Uganda is well aware of the details and has written a response worthy of everyone who has an interest in this reading. He has included a letter from over 200 Ugandan Christian leaders explaining the situation." ...|$|E

60|$|MY MUCH HONOURED FRIEND,--Yours of the 24th June {{is before}} me. I found it, {{as well as}} another valued friend--my wife, waiting to welcome me to Ayrshire: <b>I</b> <b>met</b> both <b>with</b> <b>the</b> sincerest pleasure.|$|R
6000|$|... 'There's been a lady at {{our place}} to-day, Miss Dorrit,' Plornish growled, 'and another one {{along with her}} as is a old wixen if ever <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> such. <b>The</b> way she snapped a person's head off, dear me!' ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was some}} time before I left the churchyard. On my way homeward, <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> woman who had acted as comforter: she was just {{returning}} from accompanying the mother to her lonely habitation, and I drew from her some particulars connected with the affecting scene I had witnessed.|$|E
60|$|Along this ridge <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> first tree-fern. This species seldom {{reaches the}} height of forty feet; the black trunk is but three or four in girth, and the {{feathery}} crown is ragged {{in comparison with the}} species of many other countries: it is the Alsophila gigantea, and ascends nearly to 7000 feet elevation.|$|E
6000|$|Now I purposed {{to write}} to you a serious poetical letter, but I find that a maxim <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> other day is a just one: [...] "On cause míeux quand on ne dit pas causons." [...] I was hindered, however, from my first {{intention}} by a mere muslin Handkerchief very neatly pinned--but [...] "Hence, vain deluding," [...] etc. Yet I cannot write in prose; it is a sunshiny day and I cannot, so here goes,-- ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Thank you, Senator," [...] said Mr. Crewe, [...] "that {{brings me}} to the very point I wish to emphasize. Everywhere in Leith <b>I</b> am <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> remark, 'Have you seen Job Braden?' And I always answer, 'No, I haven't seen Mr. Braden, and I don't intend to see him."' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{ever since}} the time when <b>I</b> first <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> book. <b>I</b> {{remember}} well roving over the bookcase, and meeting with it, and taking it out there, for fear Eleanor should see me and tell mama.

6000|$|... "I {{come from}} the warm Carolinas, and the sandbanks fringed with pines; where the great owl-rays leap and flap, like giant bats, upon the tide. But I wandered north and north, upon the treacherous warm gulf-stream, till <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> cold icebergs, afloat in the mid ocean. So I got tangled among the icebergs, and chilled with their frozen breath. But the water-babies helped me from among them, and set me free again. And now I am mending every day; but I am very sick and sad; and perhaps I shall never get home again {{to play with the}} owl-rays any more." ...|$|E
6000|$|Let me repeat my {{appreciation}} {{of the fact that}} <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> quickest response and the most generous aid among the people of Boston. There was nothing cold or critical in their treatment of me. My success, admittedly, came from some sympathy in them rather than from any real deserving on my part. I cannot understand at this distance why those charming people should have consented to receive from me, opinions concerning anything whatsoever,--least of all notions of literature,--but they did, and they seemed delighted at [...] "discovering" [...] me. Perhaps they were surprised at finding so much intelligence in a man from the plains.|$|E
60|$|A {{quarter of}} a century ago there were still to be seen in the outer suburbs of London many good old roomy houses, {{standing}} in their own ample and occasionally park-like grounds, which have now ceased to exist. They were old manor-houses, mostly of the Georgian period, some earlier, and some, too, were fine large farmhouses which a century or more ago had been turned into private residences of city merchants and other persons of means. Any middle-aged Londoner can recall a house or perhaps several houses of this description, and in one of those that were best known to me <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> skull, the story of which I wish to tell.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was Lothaire {{that did}} it," [...] {{repeated}} Carloman, [...] "and, indeed, {{you must not}} be angry with me, for my mother was so cross with me for not having stopped Osmond when <b>I</b> <b>met</b> him <b>with</b> <b>the</b> bundle of straw, that {{she gave me a}} blow, that knocked me down. And were you really there, Richard?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] rejoined Morris, [...] "it is a {{fact that}} I wish to marry his daughter. <b>I</b> <b>met</b> him <b>with</b> that <b>the</b> other day, but he was not at all vanquished." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{replied that}} <b>I</b> had <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> [...] "bold girl" [...] purely by accident, {{on her side}} {{as well as on}} mine; and then I started a new topic. [...] "Was it a {{pleasant}} dinner-party last night?" [...] I asked--as if the subject really interested me. I had not been quite four and twenty hours in England yet, and I was becoming a humbug already.|$|R
60|$|In {{the second}} place, {{it was my}} good or ill fortune, I hardly know which, to find myself {{personally}} involved--at the period of which I am now writing--in {{the mystery of the}} Indian Diamond. I had the honour of an interview, at my own office, with an Oriental stranger of distinguished manners, who was no other, unquestionably, than the chief of the three Indians. Add to this, that <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> celebrated traveller, Mr. Murthwaite, the day afterwards, and that I held a conversation with him {{on the subject of the}} Moonstone, which has a very important bearing on later events. And there you have the statement of my claims to fill the position which I occupy in these pages.|$|E
60|$|As the {{characteristic}} I want most to impress upon these short Author's Notes prepared {{for my first}} Collected Edition is that of absolute frankness, I hasten to declare that I founded my hopes not on my supposed merits but on the continued goodwill of my readers. I may say at once that my hopes have been justified out of all proportion to my deserts. <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> most considerate, most delicately expressed criticism free from all antagonism and in its conclusions showing an insight which in itself could not fail to move me deeply, but was associated also with enough commendation {{to make me feel}} rich beyond the dreams of avarice--I mean an artist's avarice which seeks its treasure in the hearts of men and women.|$|E
60|$|Some {{time ago}} {{in one of}} the many criticisms with which I am favoured, <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> remark that, at our time of life, Mr. Gladstone and I might be better {{occupied}} than in fighting over the Gadarene pigs. And, if these too famous swine were the only parties to the suit, I, for my part, should fully admit the justice of the rebuke. But, under the beneficent rule of the Court of Chancery, in former times, it was not uncommon, that a quarrel about a few perches of worthless land, ended in the ruin of ancient families and the engulfing of great estates; and I think that our admonisher failed to observe the analogy--to note the momentous consequences of the judgment which may be awarded in the present apparently insignificant action in re the swineherds of Gadara.|$|E
60|$|Scarcely any one {{of these}} except the Navicula is {{peculiar}} to the locality. A fragment apparently of some Closterium, the only one which <b>I</b> have <b>met</b> <b>with</b> in <b>the</b> collection, accompanies one of the specimens.|$|R
6000|$|With {{a feeling}} of guilt <b>I</b> <b>met</b> him <b>with</b> <b>the</b> news of our change of plan, {{softening}} the blow as best I could. He bore it composedly, though sadly, while I explained that I {{could not possibly have}} shown the children the mountains of my own accord. [...] "I have some lectures in Colorado," [...] I explained, [...] "but I shall not be gone long." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Absolutely," [...] Mr. Coulson answered. [...] "I {{never saw}} him before in my life. As decent a young chap as ever <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>with,</b> all <b>the</b> same," [...] he went on, [...] "and comes of a good American stock, too. They tell me there's {{going to be an}} inquest and that I shall be summoned, but I know nothing more than what I've told you. If I did, you'd be welcome to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'For,' said he, 'Richie, {{the king}} is a weel-natured and just man of his ain kindly nature, {{but he has a}} wheen maggots that maun be cannily guided; and then, Richie,' says he, in a very laigh tone, 'I would tell it to nane but a wise man like yoursell, but the king has them about him wad corrupt an angel from heaven; but I could have gi'en you avisement how to have guided him, but now it's like after meat mustard.'--'Aweel, aweel, Laurie,' said I, 'it may be as you say', but since I am clear of the tawse and the porter's lodge, sifflicate wha like, deil hae Richie Moniplies if he come sifflicating here again.'-- And so away I came, and I wasna far by the Temple Port, or Bar, or {{whatever}} they ca' it, when <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> misadventure that I tauld you of before." ...|$|E
6000|$|From thence I went to Carter Paterson's central office, where <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> utmost courtesy. They {{looked up}} the {{transaction}} in their day book and letter book, and at once telephoned to their King's Cross office for more details. By good fortune, the men who did the teaming were waiting for work, and the official at once sent them over, sending also by one of them the way-bill and all the papers connected with the delivery of the boxes at Carfax. Here again I found the tally agreeing exactly. The carriers' men were able to supplement the paucity of the written words with a few more details. These were, I shortly found, connected almost solely with the dusty nature of the job, and the consequent thirst engendered in the operators. On my affording an opportunity, {{through the medium of}} the currency of the realm, of the allaying, at a later period, this beneficial evil, one of the men remarked, ...|$|E
60|$|A {{few miles}} north of Coquimbo, <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ferruginous, balaniferous mass E with many silicified bones; I was {{informed}} that these silicified bones occur also at Tonguay, south of Coquimbo: their number is certainly remarkable, {{and they seem to}} take the place of the silicified wood, so common on the coast-formations of Southern Chile. In the valley of Chaneral, I again saw this same formation, capped with the recent calcareous beds. I here left the coast, and did not see any more of the tertiary formations, until descending to the sea at Copiapo: here in one place I found variously coloured layers of sand and soft sandstone, with seams of gypsum, and in another place, a comminuted shelly mass, with layers of rotten-stone and seams of gypsum, including many of the extinct gigantic oyster: beds with these oysters are said to occur at English Harbour, a few {{miles north of}} Copiapo.|$|E
60|$|It was {{pleasant}} {{to return to}} such a hearty reception as <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> from <b>the</b> doctor's family. Although my absence had been but for a few days, the children came crowding and clinging round me, declaring that it seemed like weeks since I left them. The doctor himself was, as usual, exuberant, and his wife extremely kind. Miss Blythe, I found, had not yet returned, and was not expected for some time.|$|R
60|$|By these means, I have {{scarcely}} {{any doubt}} that the Great Chagos Bank has originated,--a structure which at first appeared to me far more anomalous than any <b>I</b> had <b>met</b> <b>with.</b> <b>The</b> process of formation is nearly <b>the</b> same <b>with</b> that, by which Mahlos Mahdoo had been trisected; but in the Chagos Bank the channels of the oceanic currents entering at several different quarters, have united in a central space.|$|R
500|$|... "My {{makeup artist}} {{showed me the}} {{performance}} of Lorella Cuccarini a year ago, and it inspired me so much. <b>I</b> then <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> talented people who worked on it. The technology and concept were so genius. She was inspired after discovering Cuccarini's performance online. Thank God for YouTube or I would have never been exposed to something so inspiring. I never worked so hard on anything in my life as that performance for the Billboard Awards." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{advanced}} {{from the}} river Arguna by easy and moderate journeys, and were very visibly obliged to the care the Czar has taken to have cities and towns built in as many places as {{it is possible to}} place them, where his soldiers keep garrison, something like the stationary soldiers placed by the Romans in the remotest countries of their empire; some of which I had read of were placed in Britain, for the security of commerce, and for the lodging of travellers. Thus it was here; for wherever we came, though at these towns and stations the garrisons and governors were Russians, and professed Christians, yet the inhabitants were mere pagans, sacrificing to idols, and worshipping the sun, moon, and stars, or all the host of heaven; and not only so, but were, of all the heathens and pagans that ever <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>with,</b> <b>the</b> most barbarous, except only that they did not eat men's flesh.|$|E
6000|$|... "Strange," [...] he muttered, [...] "there {{seems to}} be some sort o' fate as links me wi' that Post-Office. It was here I began my London life as a porter, and lost my {{situation}} because the Postmaster-General couldn't see the propriety of my opening letters that contained coin and postage-stamps and fi'-pun' notes, which was quite unreasonable, for I had a special talent that way, and even the clargy tell us that our talents was given us to be used. It wasn't far from here where I sot my little nephy down, that time I got rid of him, and it was goin' up these wery steps <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> man I'm tryin' my best to bring to grief, an' that same man wants to marry one of the girls in the Post-Office, and now, I find, has saved my Tot from bein' burnt alive!

60|$|Here <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> French Engineer, {{who made}} the Mine under the Rock of the Castle at Alicant. That fatal Mine, which blew up General Richards, Colonel Syburg, Colonel Thornicroft, and at least twenty more Officers. And yet by the Account, that Engineer gave me, their Fate was their own choosing: The General, who {{commanded}} at that Siege being more industrious to save them, than {{they were to be}} say'd: He endeavour'd it many ways: He sent them word of the Mine, and their readiness to spring it; he over and over sent them Offers of Leave to come, and take a view of it, and inspect it: Notwithstanding all which, tho' Colonel Thornicroft, and Captain Page, a French Engineer, in the Service of King Charles, pursued the Invitation, and were permitted to view it, yet would they not believe; but reported on their Return, that it was a sham Mine, a feint only to intimidate 'em to a Surrender, all the Bags being fill'd with Sand instead of Gun-powder.|$|E
40|$|When George Orwell {{encountered}} {{ideas of}} a technological utopia sixty-five years ago, he acted the grumpy middle-aged man: Reading recently {{a batch of}} rather shallowly optimistic “progressive” books, I {{was struck by the}} automatic way in which people go on repeating certain phrases which were fashionable before 1914. Two great favourites are “the abolition of distance” and “the disappearance of frontiers”. I do not know how often <b>I</b> have <b>met</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> statements that “the aeroplane and the radio have abolished distance” and “all parts of the world are now interdependent” (1944) ...|$|R
6000|$|Well, I {{came the}} next day, {{and left a}} card for Dobble, with a note. He neither {{returned}} my visit, nor answered my note.

5000|$|<b>I</b> had <b>met</b> {{a number}} of people in Hungary by this time, whose careers bore a {{comparison}} with my own.
