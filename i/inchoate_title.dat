50|$|The {{title of}} discovery, {{if it had}} not been already {{disposed}} of by the Treaties of Münster and Utrecht would, under the most favourable and most extensive interpretation, exist only as an <b>inchoate</b> <b>title,</b> as a claim to establish sovereignty by effective occupation. An <b>inchoate</b> <b>title</b> however cannot prevail over a definite title founded on continuous and peaceful display of sovereignty.|$|E

50|$|Thus, a {{title that}} is inchoate cannot prevail over a {{definite}} title {{found on the}} continuous and peaceful display of sovereignty. Peaceful and continuous display of territorial sovereignty {{is as good as}} title. However, discovery alone, without a subsequent act, cannot suffice to prove sovereignty over the island. The territorial sovereignty of the defendant, Netherlands, was not contested by anyone from 1700 to 1906 so the title of discovery at best an <b>inchoate</b> <b>title</b> and does not prevail over the Netherlands claims of sovereignty.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an opinion}} by Justice John M. Harlan, the Supreme Court held that Spain's grant to Austin, even if incomplete, was {{recognized}} by the United States, thus supporting the claim of Deane's successors in title, who took possession of the land due to Austin's mortgage and subsequent default. In so holding, the Court reaffirmed its position, as set forth in previous cases, that [...] "in that treaty by which Louisiana was acquired, the United States stipulated that {{the inhabitants of the}} ceded territory should be protected in the free enjoyment of their property; that the term 'property,' as applied to lands comprehends every species of <b>title,</b> <b>inchoate</b> or complete, and embraces rights which lie in contract, executory as well as executed, and that in this respect the relation of the inhabitants to their government was not changed, the new government taking the place of that which had passed away." ...|$|R
50|$|However, the {{arbitrator}} {{noted that}} Spain could not legally grant {{what it did}} not hold and the Treaty of Paris could not grant to the United States Palmas if Spain had no actual title to it. The arbitrator concluded that Spain held an <b>inchoate</b> <b>title</b> when Spain “discovered” Palmas. However, for a sovereign to maintain its initial title via discovery, the arbitrator said that the discoverer had to actually exercise authority, {{even if it were}} a simple an act as planting a flag on the beach. In this case, Spain did not exercise authority over the island after making an initial claim after discovery and so the United States' claim was based on relatively weak grounds.|$|E
