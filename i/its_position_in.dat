5|$|Chemistry {{experiments}} {{have confirmed that}} lawrencium behaves as a heavier homolog to lutetium in the periodic table, and is a trivalent element. It thus could also be classified as {{the first of the}} 7th-period transition metals: however, its electron configuration is anomalous for <b>its</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> the periodic table, having an s2p configuration instead of the s2d configuration of its homolog lutetium. This means that lawrencium may be more volatile than expected for <b>its</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> the periodic table and have a volatility comparable to that of lead.|$|E

Some add to the illustration of the bird in question, as for example the heron, where the tail-piece shows one heron catching an eel, and another flying away. The tail-piece for Sabine's snipe, a gamebird, shows a hunter firing, and a small bird falling to the ground. There is no exclusion of human life from the images: one tail-piece depicts a works complete with smoking chimney beside a river.|$|E

Because of <b>its</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> his Periodic Table, Mendeleev called it ekasilicon (Es), and he estimated its atomic weight to be about 72.0.|$|E
5|$|It {{is thought}} that, during the Solar System's formation, Mars was created {{as the result}} of a {{stochastic}} process of run-away accretion of material from the protoplanetary disk that orbited the Sun. Mars has many distinctive chemical features caused by <b>its</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> the Solar System. Elements with comparatively low boiling points, such as chlorine, phosphorus, and sulphur, are much more common on Mars than Earth; these elements were probably pushed outward by the young Sun's energetic solar wind.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the species}} now {{considered}} to be Narcissus were in separate genera during the nineteenth century, and the situation was further confused by the inclusion of many cultivated varieties. By 1875 the current circumscription was relatively settled. By 2004 phylogenetic studies had allowed the place of Narcissus within its fairly large family to be established, nested within a series of subfamilies (Amaryllidoideae) and tribes (Narcisseae). It shares <b>its</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> the latter tribe with Sternbergia.|$|E

5|$|Neptunium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Np and atomic number 93. A radioactive actinide metal, neptunium {{is the first}} transuranic element. <b>Its</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> the periodic table just after uranium, named after the planet Uranus, led to it being named after Neptune, the next planet beyond Uranus. A neptunium atom has 93 protons and 93 electrons, of which seven are valence electrons. Neptunium metal is silvery and tarnishes when exposed to air. The element occurs in three allotropic forms and it normally exhibits five oxidation states, ranging from +3 to +7. It is radioactive, poisonous, pyrophoric, and can accumulate in bones, which makes the handling of neptunium dangerous.|$|E
5|$|Polonium-210 is {{widespread}} in the biosphere, including in human tissues, because of <b>its</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> the uranium-238 decay chain. Natural uranium-238 in the Earth's crust decays {{through a series of}} solid radioactive intermediates including radium-226 to the radioactive noble gas radon-222, some of which, during its 3.8-day half-life, diffuses into the atmosphere. There it decays through several more steps to polonium-210, much of which, during its 138-day half-life, is washed back down to the Earth's surface, thus entering the biosphere, before finally decaying to stable lead-206.|$|E
5|$|The Court found {{support for}} <b>its</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> {{the history of}} the unratified Titles of Nobility Amendment. The fact that this 1810 {{proposal}} had been framed as a constitutional amendment, rather than an ordinary act of Congress, was seen by the majority as showing that, even before the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress did not believe that it had the power to revoke anyone's citizenship. The Court further noted that a proposed 1818 act of Congress would have provided a way for citizens to voluntarily relinquish their citizenship, but opponents had argued that Congress had no authority to provide for expatriation.|$|E
